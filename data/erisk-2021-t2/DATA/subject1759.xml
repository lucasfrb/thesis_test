    <TEXT>Agree with both of these comments wholeheartedly. I live in Washington State, there #8217;s a dispensary literally a five minute walk from my apartment. I #8217;m thinking about giving my ID to my boyfriend so I physically CAN #8217;T give in to the temptation. And with vapes it #8217;s so much easier to hide that you #8217;re smoking from the support system that helps keep you sober. Ugh, it #8217;s so hard sometimes!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is everything I want to be. I don #8217;t begrudge people for smoking weed, and I recognize that it #8217;s my problem not theirs, it #8217;s just hard cause I haven #8217;t changed enough to not feel the need for weed. I #8217;m going to therapy, and working on learning to be happy with myself without any crutches, but it #8217;s a journey, and right now, these are the thoughts and feelings I #8217;m struggling with... I wish I could just flip the switch and not want it anymore, but it #8217;s going to take time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. He did. In the moment of emotional devastation it is extremely difficult to have logical, rational thoughts. He wasn #8217;t thinking about the consequences of his actions, he was thinking Gamora is dead, this is the asshole who did it, I need to punch his face in NOW.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s a good point! So yeah, maybe not guaranteed time travel, but I have this feeling that time travel is gonna be a thing because I think Ant-Man and the Wasp are going to utilize the Quantum Dimension (where time and space do what they want), and I think that Captain Marvel #8217;s movie being set in the 90s may end up being time travel related too, maybe by her coming to the future or something? I don #8217;t know, I could speculate for days! Thanks for bringing up the other two stones, I hadn #8217;t thought about that possibility at all!!! Fingers crossed Gamora #8217;s just chillin in the soul stone waiting to be resurrected...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Using the combined powers of Power, Time, Space, Reality, Mind, and Soul should be enough to do anything you want. You can change reality, you have the power to keep the reality the way you want it through infinite time and space, you can change that reality in the mind and souls of all the beings in the universe. You can create infinite resources, clear up the pollution, increase the size of the planets themselves giving more room, move people to a billion different planets to give them more room, put some instant teleporters on all those planets so no one would be separated, enlighten everyone in the universe on why they should stop fucking fighting each other, BOOM I JUST FIXED THE UNIVERSE!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t understand how else to explain  #8220;Infinite Power #8221;? Thanos, with all the stones, is MORE POWERFUL THAN A GOD. That #8217;s just... fact. All your limitations on his power are just you not understanding what infinite power means. Like, to every argument, I just have to say. He could do literally anything. He chose the easiest, simplest solution because that #8217;s all his mind would allow because that was his plan before he had infinite power. I understand Thanos #8217; decision. I don #8217;t agree with it, because I see infinite power and I see infinite possibilities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I relate so much to Kameron #8217;s self deprecation, I hope this isn #8217;t true, but it seems like she legit hates herself, and I know that feeling. I can #8217;t let myself enjoy anything because I feel I don #8217;t deserve it, and I never believe anyone when they compliment me because all I see is all of the times I #8217;ve failed and fucked up in my life, and those moments overshadow any good I #8217;ve done. Idk, maybe it #8217;s projection, but it was kind of nice to see someone so relatable to my state of mind, and made me think about how I may come across to others, this season has given me a lot to think about.</TEXT>

Men have the capacity to kill far easier than women, generally men are stronger and can overpower a woman, why wouldn #8217;t we be afraid of that? And yes, all the evil in this show is men, men rule that world. The show isn #8217;t saying all men are evil, you seem to be looking for an argument.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry if my comparison was offensive, but I #8217;m still going to stand by my opinion. I personally don #8217;t think I have a general fear of men, and generalizing is absolutely a harmful habit, and maybe comparing men to predators is problematic, but unfortunately I feel we do live in a society where a lot of men have predatory tendencies. Maybe that #8217;s just my personal experience tainting my opinion though. Most of my point was just to try to bring a different perspective to someone who was looking for an anti-male agenda. You #8217;re probably right though that I shouldn #8217;t have engaged, especially since I can #8217;t articulate myself well at all!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh Jesus Christ I literally had the same exact thing happen to me. I wanted to be Mandy not Amanda and she freaked out about it and told me she  #8216;picked Amanda for a reason #8217; and I was not to go behind her back and go by Mandy, it #8217;s NOT my name. Years later, at my first job, one of my coworkers kept trying to call me Mandy, and I would have mini panic attacks thinking about what would happen if she came in and overheard him, and he just wouldn #8217;t listen when I told him to stop, it was so stressful! Now, with my boyfriend #8217;s kids, I ask them every few months what they prefer to be called, and let them know they can choose whatever nickname they want because I never want them to feel the way I did... well this has all been sad!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After 28 years of gaslighting and emotional abuse, I finally decided I was in a safe enough place to cut ties. I am literally shaking with a combination of fear and excitement. I #8217;m so scared that they #8217;re going to come track me down at my apartment and confront me and I #8217;ll turn into that scared and compliant little girl again. But I #8217;m so excited at the possibility that they #8217;ll respect my wish to leave me alone and I might actually be able to heal from the years of anxiety and depression! I #8217;m finally in a position in my life where even if my boyfriend left me, my friends abandoned me, I would be able to survive on my own. I don #8217;t need my nfamily anymore. The last thing they held over me is gone. I am a strong woman with a stable job and I don #8217;t owe them shit. I know there aren #8217;t many details here and it might not make sense, I guess this is just me trying to word vomit my feelings into the void. I guess can anyone relate to this moment and give me any advice about how to get rid of the fear now that the cause of the fear is hopefully gone? Also, sorry for any grammatical errors, run on sentences, and word vomit in general!</TEXT>

Which just goes to show how little they know about me, and how delusional they are. Thanks for the support, I will stick to my guns, I deserve to live in reality not someone else #8217;s fantasy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. Relatable. When I was still living at home from about 16-23 years old she would do raids on my room and if she found any cosmopolitan magazines or god forbid any of my sex toys (it #8217;s perfectly natural don #8217;t @ me) she would throw them all out. Then when I got home I would get yelled at for having sinful disgusting things in her home. First of all, if you don #8217;t look you won #8217;t be offended, second, what a waste of money toys are expensive, and finally when I was over 18 it especially pissed me off because I #8217;M AN ADULT. I can make my own choices. Just not in her house apparently!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My narc sister won't stop trying to contact me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-03 20:20:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it's been four wonderful months since I went NC with my abusive family. I sent them a letter through Facebook stating my reasons for NC and asked them to respect my wishes to have nothing to do with them, and they should consider me dead to them. I have no intention of ever going back to them, I consider myself an orphan now. The one thing stopping me from fully grieving and moving on however, is my obsessed narc sister. She is the only one who has tried to contact me at all, and seems to be refusing to let go. She has used dummy phones to text and leave me voicemails, has reached out to my friends trying to get info on me, and even tried messaging me through the fitbit app which I've promptly deleted and given away my fitbit now just so I don't have to deal with that. Her message is always the same. She 'loves' me, but family is family forever and I can't change that no matter what I say or do. I have nightmares about her and the family tracking me down and confronting me, reducing me to the quiet scared kid I become when I'm around them, instead of the self sufficient woman I'm becoming with them gone. I don't know what to do other than keep ignoring her and hope she doesn't escalate the behavior. I just wish she would respect my wishes and leave me be, it causes panic attacks everytime I see her words or hear her voice, even typing all this out leaves me shaking. Anyway, I guess any advice would be great, or solidarity, or anything, please?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-23 05:12:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know if it even counts as molestation or abuse because to my knowledge, from what I can remember, it only happened once. When I was around 5, my 19 year old brother came into my room one day and said let #8217;s play a game. He had me straddle him while I was wearing a dress and I know it sounds bizarre but he had me bounce up and down. I wasn #8217;t comfortable with it and asked if I could go back to playing with my toys and he said no just a little longer and kept saying stuff about how good I was doing until finally he let me go back to playing on my own. Looking back I know I was sitting where his dick would be because I specifically remember looking down because I was too shy to look him in the eyes, and I could see his belly button because his shirt was pulled up a bit. So I think he basically had me simulating sex on him. I feel like this was wrong and gross, but when I think of all the people who have actually been molested or raped, I feel like I don #8217;t deserve to call my experience anything but just weird... any thoughts or opinions on this??? Was it molestation or just me blowing it out of proportion??? Edit: Thank you everyone for responding with such warm advice and compassion! I feel really validated now that it #8217;s not just me blowing things out of proportion, but something that hurt and confused me for years, and it #8217;s ok to feel the way I feel about it. I have been going to therapy but I hadn #8217;t brought this up because I was scared it wasn #8217;t even a thing to be worried about, but now I think I will bring it up and try to work through it. Thank you, everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Non existent, I recently cut him and the rest of my relatives off for toxic behavior. On top of that incident I was emotionally, verbally, and a few times physically abused by the different members of my family for years so I recently decided enough was enough. Now with the distance, I #8217;m seeing my childhood in a whole new light, and I #8217;ve stopped making excuses for their behaviors... it #8217;s been strange having all these memories come to the forefront and expose themselves for what they really were. At least I think that #8217;s what #8217;s going on, I keep doubting myself and wondering if I #8217;m just being dramatic... I #8217;m just a bit of a mess!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for reminding me not to be so dramatic lol you #8217;re right, I #8217;m not bad, just confused! Maybe I could just do tiny little things without scarring them (that #8217;s my worry is that I #8217;d effect their lives in a bad way) but maybe I can even do some little things without them being too little!!! I like your idea of coloring and cartoons, that shouldn #8217;t be too weird hopefully!!!</TEXT>
