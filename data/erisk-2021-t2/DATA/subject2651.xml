    <TEXT>Depending what are you doing with your PC. If it's just an office PC, one fan is enough, because stuff don't get so warm. If it's a gaming rig, then 3 fans are mandatory, more is recommended. If you have only one fan, it's better to have it at the back as exhaust. In case of 3, two intake fans in front and one exhaust in the back. How many fan headers your mobo have? The fan which comes with the case is 3- or 4-pin? Your budget is per fan or all fans?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your Mobo has 3 chassis fans, so you're good to go. Put the stock fan to the back and put two new in the front. From the budget here, you could probably grab some Noctuas (which are one of the best fans you can get) otherwise personally I use (or used) be quiet! Pure Wings 2 PWM (a decent one) and Arctic F12 PWM (very budget friendly, good performance for the price )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, it's your choice. Arctic is good fan for good price. be quiet is... well, quieter, looks and feels more premium. Otherwise, performancewise are they similiar IMO. If you buy the PMW PST Pack, you can connect all 5 and throw the stock one (your case supports only 2 front, 2 top and one rear). The PWM PST Arctic Fans allow you to chain up to 4 fans on one header, so you can have two front chained, two top chained and the rear one separate. Connect them all and you should be good to go, because all of them are 4-pin ones. If you buy be quiet PW2 fans, you'll connect each fan to each header and you're done, but possibly you have to check out the settings in BIOS, since the stock one is 3-pin one, PW2 is 4-pin as I am aware. And it would be just a bit complicated in the future if you'll get overheating issues, cos you won't have any headers and you'll need a splitter. About thermals, I honestly don't know. I'm not sure how good airflow is in your case after you built it. I don't know how much warmth your components will produce, but IMO it should be fine...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are ppl who say you should get cheaper motherboard or cheaper PSU. I'm not recommending that. I've bought myself a cheap motherboard, my VRMs are getting so hot it's throttling my CPU (R5 2600). Your Motherboard choice is great, you might go for MSI B450-A Pro Max, which is basically Tomahawk with less fancy look and no usb-c in order to save few bucks. Getting too cheap PSU you may put your components in danger. The eGPU, as many already mentioned, it's not a good idea. A friend of mine got an eGPU, which got more powerful GPU than I got, but I still have better performance Do you really need the H510i? The H500 should be cheaper and looks the same. It just missing the usb-c You might wait few more months and save some more cash to get one. Btw, in what resolution and fps you want to play?</TEXT>

If not, you won't need it (but then you'll have a non-functional port).
