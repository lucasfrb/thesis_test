    <TEXT>What are you all looking for ? I #8217;m seeing F for M or M for F but if it #8217;s only for friendship what are you wanting? I #8217;m curious, but also maybe interested. Is it just friendship with the opposite sex? Is it hoping for more than that? Is it that ur low key afraid to flirt with someone but that #8217;s what ur actually wanting? Are you wanting a real friendship online, but with benefits too? Or r u just wanting a completely normal friendship? Idk what u want, and it #8217;s different for everyone. I #8217;m interested and I #8217;m not going to be a creep (unless that #8217;s what you want). I just want to be what ur looking for while still being me. Yes I #8217;m pretty much open to anything (I do have limits tho but I won #8217;t be offended if you ask). So ask away my friends. Tell me what u want by message/chatting with me and I #8217;ll get back to you. I reply fast if I #8217;m awake (might be going to bed soon tho idk). And if u actually read to here I think ur rlly interested so just text me ur favourite berry/fruit in ur message.</TEXT>
