    <TEXT>YTA! You will pay for your daughters wedding if she was strait but because she is marrying someone of the same sex you won #8217;t...that is homophobic!!! OP just just because your daughter is in a same sex marriage doesn #8217;t mean she and her partner can #8217;t have kids. Even if she doesn #8217;t have kids that their choice. It #8217;s an AH move to not pay for the wedding because it does not meet your ideals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In college I took/payed for a neuroscience class where the teacher would spend the first ten minutes of the class on topic and then he would get  #8220;bored or neuroscience #8221; (In his own words) He would then start teaching his theory on how in the future we would chop off our own libs, organs, other body parts (willingly) in order to exchange them for bionic parts which would perform better. We as a class would purposely keep him off topic most days by asking about what the olympics and other things would be like, so come test day he would cancel it or give us the answers because  #8220;we didn #8217;t learn that #8221;. In my 4 years at university it was the only class I got 100% in. SMH!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. As the reddit detectives found out you cheated on your now ex-wife and you might not think it #8217;s relevant in this story but it is. You gave your daughters college fund to your now wife. Who is the woman who you cheated on daughters mother with your an AH for that! 2. You insult your daughter to her face by telling her she won #8217;t get into private school because she is not serious even tho she told you earlier she was. Your still an AH but now x2 4. Finally you black mail and put conditions on your daughter that if she doesn #8217;t accept the women you cheated on her mom with she couldn #8217;t get the money. Your an AH x3. I wish you luck in repairing what #8217;s left of your relationship with your daughter. I might suggest leaving your new wife out your daughter life until your daughter expresses that she wants to see her.</TEXT>

My routine is take an epsom salt bath and put my electronics away an hour before bed. After I get out take 1 Advil and go read a book (not in your bed all you should do in bed is sleep, don #8217;t nap in bed ether). When I #8217;m tired I go drink a cup of milk and if I #8217;m hungry I put a small amount of cereal in it. Then lay down and just worry about deep breaths. If you catch yourself saying I can #8217;t fall asleep get up and go read book again.  #8220;Sleep is best found when you don #8217;t look for it #8221; Wish you luck!</TEXT>

Regarding life while at school: Try as many new things as you can that #8217;s how you find out what you like. Take pottery, communication, yoga class... this goes with every day things as well, dye your hair a different color, chop off all your hair, try a new style of clothing, hang out with new people. Regarding safety: Most Universities offer a self defense class (ours was free) take it and brush up one a year. (Only if you are comfortable with it) I would carry pepper spray on my keys. Finally know the safety programs your school offers, we had a walker program. I had a class that got out at 9pm and had to walk in not very well lit and empty part of campus.

    <TEXT>In sequoia national forest there is a patch of 3-4 that were intentionally set on fire to  #8220;see if they could be burned down #8221;. I don #8217;t think we need AITAH to determine that person is an AH!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>One Pixie Hair Cut</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 02:25:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been rocking a supper short pixie haircut for 4+ years now. My original hairstylist quit right before COVID. Then COVID hit and I didn #8217;t feel comfortable getting a haircut. Fast forward six months to yesterday. My hair had grown out to a mullet so I researched for a highly rated place to get it cut. When I got there the stylist ask  #8220;ohh you are growing your hair out guess you didn #8217;t like your pixie cut, just a trim? #8221;. I corrected her and tried to make a joke out of it  #8220;I love my pixie cut but this is quarantine hair. I want to get it all cut off and back into a pixie style please #8221;. Durning the hair cut she kept saying comments like,  #8220;you have such nice hair you would look cute with it to your shoulders #8221;  #8220;hmmm when do you think you #8217;ll grow it out again #8221;  #8220;Guess you have to be really strong for a woman to cut off all your hair #8221; I had my glasses off so I couldn #8217;t really see. But when she gave my glasses back....my hair looked bad! Pieces all different sizes and just looked very choppy! She ask how I like it (I #8217;m not one to lie if I am not happy) so I said  #8220;I #8217;m not happy with it #8221;. That is when she responded with  #8220;Well girls shouldn #8217;t get their hair cut to a boys length, maybe you should have gone to a barber #8221;. I took her  #8220;advice #8221; and went to the nearest barber. I walk in and explained what happened and asked if they would fix it. He said no problem and fixed it. He told me  #8220;it #8217;s a nice break from his day to do a feminine short hair cut, and everyone is welcome here #8221; So my new hair stylist is a barber! Edit: For those asking about payment: The hair cut cost $35. She gave me her  #8220;advise #8221; as I walked up to the counter to pay. I wanted to just walk out but she did  #8220;a job #8221; and I put $5 on the counter and walked out. Hindsight I paid $5 for the best advise I could have gotten Lol. Edit2:Wowww this is my first post and had no idea it would get this much comments! First I thought I was weird going to the barber guess not. I love how much support there is here and thank you to the many people have shared their hair story. Everyone keeps asking me to rate this hair stylist. I did. Unfortunately Judgy Scissor hands (as one person named her) was the owner. I left reviews everywhere you can, unfortunately the reason I chose her because of great review sooo...I did my best. Finally thank you for the awards kind people! Final edit (probably) I cant go to any of the newer comments and see or reply. All I see are ones from 2 hours ago, but I have notifications on phone. Please feel free to message me if you know what #8217;s going on. Once again thank you for all the kind messages!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also it #8217;s so sad to me that we genderize hair so much. I can #8217;t tell you the number of times I hear your hair is so short it looks like a boy. Like you said we should all just have hairstyles we like and that #8217;s the end of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry that happened to you! One of the most liberating thing I did was cut my hair into a pixie cut! I had work a year at a restaurant and had my hair in a bun 24/7! I went to my stylist (pre-COVID stylist) and said I need a change and she said do you trust me! It #8217;s history from there!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My hair is very thin as well! And it #8217;s worse the longer it gets. When its in a pixie cut it gets really thick and wavy. That #8217;s one of the reasons I keep it this way!</TEXT>
