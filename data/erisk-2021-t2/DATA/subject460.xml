    <TITLE>Why do you get the idea that Korea gt;china?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-22 07:48:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean, in all 2013, China vs Korea, it was always china winning. With something like maybe 20-2. WE and iG stomped Najin Sword (after they won Ogn), MvP ozone (with their current roster) and other koreans 2 or 3 months ago. Do you really think LPL made china weaker? Or maybe they just got stronger with the new teams (OMG, PE and Royal) and noone knows how really strong they are because they didn't face other regions yet. . I really think China is the real deal and will remake IPL5 at worlds. If people think All-stars has anything to do with the strengh of the teams, you really get it wrong.</TEXT>

Will they handle travel when LCS players are used to travel every week? Will they be prepared? How will that go?</TEXT>

Just like Cloud 9 smoked NA, the new EU linups will be too strong. And it's about time, the game needs new blood. With how close EU summer split has been (5 tie for second), it will be one of hell of a competitive region and gambit will be to weak for it comes second split.</TEXT>

CW/Heroes/H2k/TCM/Millenium/Pr0p/STO/Supahotcrew/DigUK are all LCS caliber, and there are many others upcoming teams. Garena has 12 OGN has 16 LCS EU could be the 4 servers (EUNE/Turkish/Euw/Russia) with 16 teams ,but it's only 2 servers with the most populated (EUW) and only 8 teams :/ Makes no sense at all.</TEXT>

Next lobby, the Nida from previous game is here and picks Eve jungle. Game loads and i see the duo-bot from previous game on the enemy team. He proceeds to camp bot lane, goes 18-3 and carry the game to a 20 min surrender. I was so happy, that the flamers from past game got crushed, by the same player they picked-on.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A very big tip for junglers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-03 09:58:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>If lanes lose "it's my fault", I dont mean literally, but that's the mindset you must have to improve. Of course when people die 1v1 or do stupid things it's not your fault, but... Everytime a lane gets ganked, it's your fault, because you could have been there and counter-ganked him. So every time he ganks, ask yourself: What did you do? Did you gank another lane? did you take drake? Did you steal his buff? Did you take a tower? Was it worth it? Everytime the enemy jungler does something, you must do something in counterpart, apply pressure on the map. See the game as a contest between junglers. If you are stronger than him in 1v1/2v2, hunt him and countergank the shit of him. If you are weaker, avoid him but still do more than him. Compete with the other jungler to win the game, not to prove yourself to your teammates.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>EU LCS s4 Prediction and why Riot needs to ADD 2-4 more spots</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-05 21:38:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>First let me start by saying that LCS will now be dominated by a few big Esports Organisations with money, trades and gaming houses as shown by roster changes recently. So what will happen in S4 qualifications? There is very little chance for NiP and SK to drop of LCS in 2014 or any time in the futur. Why? Because big Orgas have the ability to buy players and hold the spot instead of the players. Where does this leave Amateur teams? Without much chances to get a spot in LCS against teams with gaming houses and such. If it stays like this , what will happen? There will be 8 big Organisations with money holding the LCS, trading players who have very little to say, and stealing the strongest players of every amateur teams. How to fix this? There needs to be 12 teams at least in LCS, with 6 spots to compete for each tourney. This way, amateur teams can hope for a spot in LCS and not just to be picked up as a sub for an established team. Additionnaly, there are a lot of teams who could compete on LCS level, such as millenium, CW, H2k but probably not strong enough to knock out experienced players such as SK/NiP.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-11-08 11:49:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Back then i was gold5, i didn't see the point of going higher, and believed i could not because i was too bad. I used to be bronze and i thought i just had luck getting gold so i just sticked to normals, too anxious to play ranked. Normal games are nice for me because there are a lot of diam/plat players and never any flame. I met a Diamond1 guy and we duo-Qed for some normals. I check lolnexus (it's always open ikr) and i see that it's only diamonds except me. So i ask: erm isn't it ranked? He says no. W/e, i'm last pick, jungle is open, i didn't know what to pick so i get Shen jungle(I never play it), it's a normal after-all. I do one gank top(1kill) and one bot (1 kill + drake) before lvl 6 then **i run around with oracles and wards, waiting to ult somewhere the whole game...** We win i'm 2-0-12, and the janna adds me to friends to duo because she liked how i played with the oracles clearing whole map. Then what do i see, it was ranked. And my buddy says: "WTF it was ranked lol. You see, it aint that hard, people don't play that good even at high elo." After this game, i knew it's possible if you invest the time to. So don't give up, you can do it too.</TEXT>

I know i suck but, when people get caught solo in a lane 35 min in and it makes us lose an even fight, i can't restrain myself.I just want that guy to feel bad for what he did. I wouldn't act like that if i had a good life, my life sucks, i hate it, and i hate myself even more than others. I'm frustrated because i fail my life, i fail in-game,. So, if i see aplayer trying to kinda troll, i'll spend my whole time trying to make him feel miserable. Nolimits.Troll me get the consequences. I'm not even sorry, because i dont give a fk.World is full of fuktards and so is league, difference is IRL u'd shut the fuk up or i'd make u. People are too sensitive.

    <DATE>2013-11-16 07:41:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I play a lot of Arams, and it 's so obvious, you can usually tell a player's division just by looking at him for 1 minute. Why? Because a lot of players can only play the laning phase but don't have the mechanics/judgement to play correctly in skirmishes/teamfights. That's how when some silver tells you "but i'm always 5-0 out of lane'. Yes, maybe, but if you are 5-0 vayne and you can't A-move and Q into CC, it's not helping. I think, players should take aram as a great way to practice mechanics and team fight skills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to get very Hyped for league of legend matchs, and Season 2 world championship + IPL 5 got me so excited. But after IPL5, after 1 split of LCS, i found myself watching the first 5-10 min of matches, or only the results. One of the main reasons i dont watch full games is because 9 times/10 it's decided in the first 10 minutes. It was more intense in s2 when comebacks were often happening, and you never knew until the mid/late teamfights. Now it's basically: Get a lead gt;Take control of map gt;close game (with the occasional throw) Also the meta has been very stagnant the past year with no real innovation, it's professionnal, it's effective, but it becomes a bit dull for the viewer i am. It's very rare to see new picks/things outside of the chinese scene (on this i liked the curse academy no ADC strat). Now i check esport calendar, i look forward to a few matchs, and in the end i dont watch them, only the results. Can't wait for s4 changes to get me hyped a bit again ;)</TEXT>

If ahead, she does really nice damage with very low cooldowns. While she's not as strong as Orianna, she is just behind along with Karma in the utility Mids. I often win games i should lose with another mid laner, because i had a really bad game, but with lulu's kit i was able to help my team carry me.</TEXT>

So if you gank and fail, or if you get Invaded/counter -jungled, you'd earn more gold being afk in a lane bush. Now add to that the fact that you spend gold on a machete, and non cost efficient items. **Other post about midgame gold:** http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1rfm09/powerfarming_jungle_more_than_solo_lane_farm_by/ **Amumu 7400 gold at 20 min (way more than max possible in solo lanes)** : http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1rg23a/amumu_7400_gold_at_20_minute_more_than_any_solo/ They need to find a better balance because midgame gold earned is op while early game gold is really bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, i was trying to see the gold you can get at 20 min , and i picked the SLOWEST clear jungle: Warwick **My path:** **Runes:**AS/AR/AS/GP10 quints (gp10 quints because you get faster your Spirit item and warwick is safe jungle) **Masteries:** 17-0-13 Machete+1pot 1st back at 6:58: SotEL or SotAG(slower will grant you around 6500g) 2nd back: Mobility boots 3rd back: Tiamat After you have tiamat, you melt camps. I earned 6950 Gold by 20 minutes, that's more than 90% of max gold possible (but it's not achievable due to harass, recalls,ganks, deaths and failed last hits) as you can see here: http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111226174833/leagueoflegends/images/6/65/Perfect_Creep_Score.png **Other build i tried:** Rush tiamat and ignore jungle items: total earned: 5950 gold Then i tried it in a real game and i had full build at 30 minutes with second gold after our 14-2 fiora/ **Amumu : 7400 gold in 20 min :** http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1rg23a/amumu_7400_gold_at_20_minute_more_than_any_solo/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Early game as a jungler is painfull. If you get behind and dont rush your gold items you'll never catch up. But if you get ahead, you can outfarm and outscale anyone on the map.

    <TEXT>Accidentaly deleted other post, so i made another one ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Reminder:** As a solo lane , with perfect CS you cannot earn more than 7170 gold **by 20 min**. I posted about Amumu a week ago ([Here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1rg23a/amumu_7400_gold_at_20_minute_more_than_any_solo/)), but with the change to Wriggles cost, it's possible to have it 5 min into the game. Making attack speed junglers really powerfull farmers. **Jungle path:** Blue gt;Wight gt;Wolves gt;Wraiths gt;Red gt;Golems gt;Wraiths gt;Wolves gt;Wight gt;... golems gt;... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Warwick:** http://imgur.com/TTn43gl Wriggles: 1650 Hydra: 3300 Mob boots + Homeguard: 1475 Avarice: 800 Current gold: 1291 **Total:** 8516 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **UDYR:** http://imgur.com/cOIkGa8 5 Potions: 210 Wriggles: 1650 (gold earned by passive: 1250) Iceborn: 3250 Mob boots: 1000 Avarice: 800 (gold earned by passive: 420) Current gold: 2020 Tower destroyed: -100 **Total:** 8830 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Shyvana:** http://imgur.com/crEiKrZ 5 potions: 210 Mobility + Homeguard: 1475 Wriggles: 1650 Tiamat: 1900 Avarice Blade: 800 Current Gold: 3078 Tower destroyed: -100 **Total:** 9013 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I suck with these champs so i may not have done anything optimal, i'm sure it's possible to be at least 500 higher. Go and try to break my records! **Conclusion:** Basically, it's 'possible' **(i don't mean it's good to do that in a real game, because you have 4 team-mates counting on you and objectives to fight for)** to have the gold of a Solo Laner with Perfect CS who got 6-7 kills on top of that.

    <TEXT>Lolking your teammates on current and previous season If someone has good stats and a decent amount of game on the champion he just picked, camp his lane and snowball him. Even if he is a dick Even if it's a non standard pick (sejuani top or something) chances are if he has a good win ratio with the champ and a good amount of games, he's trying hard and will have a big influence. if it's 1/3 malzahar mid over 4 games, dont bother. if all your teammates are 1/5 ratio and low amount of game, try to carry by yourself. Of course this trick is to add to the usual " good shotcalling, positive influence etc..) Exemple: i had this tank (sunfire, abyssal..) Teleport katarina top with 57% win over 100 games. i camped her lane. She got a lot of hate for her pick and build, but with my help (even if she didn't get any kills against renekton), the fact that i helped her stay ahead in lane and be able to teleport bot she just carried the game alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>last time at worlds we had the "Annie support" from Royal who stayed a high pick for months in all regions.

Currently we can see some picks like Kayle top, Sejuani jungle, Jayce + blitz bot, Soraka mid and a bunch of unorthodow things. Like last year Misaya had Sion banned constantly against him. It probably won't happen in Allstars because OMG is not known for innovating but for consistant play and strategies.

    <DATE>2014-06-22 17:59:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everything is going all right, Everyone is nice and compliment each other, Top is winning, mid is 4-0 , bottom is farming and jungler pressure all lanes and stole their blue while their jungler is behind You are in your lane, peacefully laning , thinking " for once i have a nice team, no doubt it's gonna be a win" Then 13 min in, against their very passive team, your jungler (Lee sin) gets killed in their jungle and score is 8-1. That's where it starts. Lee blames top for not helping on the invade. Top replies Lee is dumb for invading when mia. Mid tells lee to stfu. Lee tells Mid to stfu and stop elo boosting his sucking teammates, "look jinx 30 cs behind ,awesome duoQ" blablablablablabla Everyone start dying all over the map, while typing, blaming and moaning. Then we lose. only me (supp) and the ADC shut up and won our lane and went 7-2 -5 both scores combined at the end yet it didn't matter because the game was over since everyone turned on eachother for nothing and started suiciding 1 by 1 in the enemy team.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-07-17 11:35:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>IF anyone follows the chinese scene, they have Really really good upcoming talent with teams such as King.tc. With clear rotations, individual skill, decisive shot -calling and ability to close out games. While China is learning from Koreans (importing players and coaches), they start to take league seriously. With more than **1000 challenger teams** across all servers, the talent pool is definitly higher than Korea. THe problem is the lack of infrastructure (Money) but they are slowly getting to it. Anyone else see them catching up on the long-term? Even lustboy said NA/eu might catch-up to korea in a while, but with how deep talent poool is in china, don't they have a better chance to catch-up or even surpass them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My bro was stuck in bronze 1 playing adc's like MF, jinx etc... HE was losing a lot of games because they had a fed assassin/bruiser who would instantly delete him. He's pretty good mechanically but doesn't have much knowledge. So i told him: Pick Tristana, she's good in lane with E harass, control waves and has nice all -in at 6. Often you can 2v3 the jungler when he ganks because you have all minions pushed and they tank them. Safest mid-late game with escapes and crazy dmg. What i told him was: Even if you lose, tell your team to defend, farm 5 items, and the game is over , you just kill everything from 1000 range while your team are meatshields. + the resets! and fast steroid to push towers. Since then he went to gold 1 with like a 80% win ratio with her.Is she that effective? Some of his games were pretty funny where he started 1/7 or something and ended up 18-7 with a penta because it was 40 min and he got full items by splitpushing</TEXT>

Now last hitting with Q not only gives you mana but HP too you rush revolver then spirit visage.

    <TEXT>People , up to diamond pick some mindless LCS meta. How u gain free elo? You dump them in lane. WHy? Because LCS picks are not the best laners but they get support from their team or can play relativly safe according to a team strategy. Now if u see a maokai top? You can Dunk him over and over with a few champs. SO how u get this free elo? Watch LCS, see champions that work, train a lane counter (exemple , akali for yasuo) and if you are good with it, you'll shit all over them. It's not LCS, they wont have support from their team.

I mean, next OGN season, they may just buy the top 2-3 teams and put them in LSPL (challenger league of china). But there is also the possibility that they fail miserably at International events/worlds and all of this crash into pieces. There is also the possibility an All-chinese team domnates all the KRCH hybrids and kills the korean Hype there. What about the chinese players who could feel frustrated being paid less and be in the shadow of these korean superstars? WHat do you think?

    <TITLE>The real truth: China's conspiracy to take over Lol e-sport in the world</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-11 18:56:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>**China's E-sport secret agent:** Ok we have the most players, the biggest fanbase, but we can never beat those dam koreans, what should we do? **Billionaires council:** Dunno, give them money, we got so much we don't know what to do with it. **China's E-sport secret agent:** OMG , i know, we can buy them, give them better house, and biachs, and load of cash, then put 2 of them on each team. **Billionaires council:** But it won't be China playing it will be just Koreans leading the pack, we're not up for this. **China's E-sport secret agent:** Here's the trick ! We'll make super teams with only the best chinese players, we wont let teams with koreans win and well blame it on communication issues. **Billionaires council:** Oh that's right, we own all the teams, we can make them lose and in the end prove that China got better than Korea. **China's E-sport secret agent:** Yeah, and when we crashed the Korean, we'll bench their best players in LSPL, throwing money and biachs so they never go back to stop us ! We'll be the kings of esports and the top of the world! **Billionaires council:** Okay, how much do you need? **China's E-sport secret agent:** $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ **Billionaires council**/ **China's E-sport secret agent**: FOR CHINA!!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ofc SKT looks super strong but the facts are: Top 2 LCK at IEM got dominated by the 12 th (and still 12th) lpl team and they even lost to NA SKT nearly lost to Fnatic with Steelback, and EU is not that strong compared to China I think going to 5 games against EDG is more a result of EDG screwing up than anything Sure LCK has improved, Fnatic too (not EU), but LPL has improved a lot more. So i dont get it, **if it wasn't Faker's team** there would be less hype. If it was KOO dominating like SKT, people wouldn't believe KR is strong. It' s only Faker hype</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, i followed it for 5 seasons now but i think i will only watch International events now and not anymore LCS/LPL. It's been 3 seasons, even after half of KR players left, that KR is roflstomping at worlds. Only thing remotly interesting now is : "Hey lets tune in and check if the KR team did lose a game" **Keep in mind, this is the year KR has been the WEAKEST since S3 with losing half or more of their Pros** Season 8 "And this new team formed of KR soloQ swept the worlds not dropping a single death the whole tournament, even in the finals to the Veterans SKT in an incredible one sided victory 3-0" lol After a few more seasons of trying hard for west, CN fails and money sinks, at some point it will be: "ok we're done here boys". And it gets boring for the fans after a while. Chinese fans already hate having KRs in every of their team, i don't know what will happen but it smells very bad over there. Starcraft got boring because of that, i think it will be the same. Edit: Many downvotes but you will see in a few years that this is actually true. People will lose interest in watching their region getting stomped into the ground every year. Not many people watch Basket-ball in EU , you know why...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since fervor nerf, you can't really stack on minions and jump your opponent for insane trades. But one thing about jax, is everything can be good on him. Going 12/0/18 or 0/12/18 as your choice, you can have nice sustain in lane with short trades. Now later on you can become a healing machine. Guinsoo/Gunblade/ then full tank with spirit visage (unless it's full ad). (Warmog, randuin, DMP, Sterrak...) or you can even add deathdance if you feel like it. I find it pretty strong, makes his hard lanes easier. Jax does not need more than guinsoo and gunblade as damage. Then nothing stops you to go trinity as third tho if you feel like going full assassin.</TEXT>

Pepineero is the star in a bad team. Look at it this way, when NA teams win and EU players there play very well, we can just watch them and be proud for both of us. They deserve the offers they got, they worked hard to be there and got litle in return. THey get better results than China and yet they earn what 1/50 of their salaries? comon, that's not fair. Lets say TSM wins worlds in s6, both EU and NA can be proud because it would be EU+NA united.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I 'm new to preseason and all so I went vs cait as MF (i supposed she was way stronger early). Both sopports backed, we both have a dorans ring and are level 5 full HP , we both have no heal. so i thought i was stronger, i go in for a trade out of the minions, i eat headshot, E, Q, flash-auto, and i'm dead she lost like 30 % hp. It took her like 1s to combo be 100-0 I guess i should stay behind minions so i dont get the E connected but that was a lot of burst oO</TEXT>

He 's a late game champ that gets his power spike mid-game thanks to the new masteries. With the new Stormraider next time and furror enchants will he be even stoppable?

    <TITLE>What people usually don't know about Nasus</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-26 07:07:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>People believe he needs 600 stacks or something to be effective. But the truth is he needs 200 + stacks to 1v1 almost anyone. and they usually underestimate him trying to all in him at level 9 or something only to try to back up but it's too late for them. He's a mid game powerhouse, and he actually falls off late game because at this point hard carries kill him in a stun before he reaches his targets. (so QSS on him is very important) He wins lane against fiora/GP/jax.. but late game they are better than you. Do not pick him against vayne, if possible. Another reason he falls off is because after laning phase, you can't always splitpush, you often have to play in team for objectives and can't really stack that much anymore. He's not a tank, when he can't sustain on a target he's squishy(Even more with the % hp and true DMG in this game). You should not frontline and run at them . It's not an iceborn/FH + spirit visage that will make you a big tank. He has no innate tankiness out of his ulti. He a sustain damage dealer. And should never initiate unless extremy ahead.</TEXT>

Second they keep skipping QSS only to get stunned/rooted the whole fight and that's his biggest weakness. When will people undestand that QSS is a core item on him and that a DMP/sterrak/etc are nice but won't help you kill people if you are parma CC.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Exemple of why Koreans dont take Dynamic Q seriously</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-06 08:11:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>While doing my research on builds for my other posts i looked a lot of profiles of masters/challenger players in Korea. It appeared that master is FILLED with people who were VERY far from where they are now. It was kinda SHOCKING. For exemple: http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=%EB%B0%95%EC%8B%A0%EC%96%91 This is not an isolated case, it's a big percent of the masters that were from gold1 to diam 2 in S5. I don't say they are boosted, or anything. But there are possible explanations: 1: Dynamic Queue skill is different from soloQ. Team coordination and all the stuff. 2: Most previous Diam1, Masters don't play Dynamic Q 3: These guys got increased skill overnight.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-02-15 14:15:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been thorycrafting with her a bit, i know she is strong in the jungle with devourer but lets see what she can bring to top lane. I saw Titanic Hydra has good synergy with her Q . She is awesome in the splipushing area, with low cd ult and nice speed to escape . She can use ZZrot as well. Question is, how much will she struggle against the meta picks? I know you can farm safelly by maxing E tho. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Akali mains Rejoice, Koreans found you a new Top lane OP build</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-18 09:37:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's starting to get more popular in korea, and even draws bans in master/challenger. http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=taiwanakali (You can even spectate he is ingame right now) Edit: It's not only a OTP, it's played a lot in diamond up to challenger http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=%EB%AA%BD%EB%AA%BD%20ing http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84%EC%97%90%EB%AA%A9%EC%88%A8%EC%95%88%EA%B2%80 http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=%EC%B9%B4%EB%A7%88%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80 You can watch their replays to give you an idea. The difference is the buffed Q, E on 1 sec CD, they pick one point in Q, one in W, then max E then W. This change alone made the build popular Edit 2: Since it reached frontpage, GL in soloQ. I wonder how it affects her play-rate today. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit 3: details: skill order: Q- gt;E- gt;E- gt;W. Max E, take at lvl 8 a second point in q. then max w and q last. masteries: 0-12-18 with grasp runes: 3x ap quints, 9x ad marks, 9x armor seals, 9x scaling mr glyphs build: start with cloth armor vs ad and with ruby crystal vs true dmg/ap. get bamis cinder. then rush sunfire vs AD or spectral cowl vs ap. mercs/tabis/swifties are all situational. Get Tiamat then spirit visage vs ap/thornmail vs full ad upgrade tiamat to titanic. if you are ahead its okay to build zhonyas or rylais for some damage. last items are thornmail and banshees. example build: bamis cinder- gt;boots- gt;sunfire- gt;tiamat- gt;mercury treads- gt;spirit visage- gt;titanic hydra- gt;thornmail- gt;banshees (this is how taiwan akali plays her) Exemple of a game where Akali snowballs (another akali player) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGvohe8GX9c</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The real state of Dynamic Queue. What works best to climb? Exemples.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-24 20:38:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm enjoying DQ, i'm climbing solo with a 65 % winrate, and have a good experience so far. But, like everyone, it bugged me because i saw a lot of Swaps in champ select, coordinated ganks, people who talk the same language etc. If you don't know me i made Korean profiles who reached front page several times so i go on OP.gg quite a lot. Something seemed really OFF because there are a LOT of masters/high diamonds who were Low diam/Plat/Gold or even silver and you tell yourself: is it possible these thousands of people just got better overnight?. ------------------------------------------------------------------- SO i decided to check a bit on op.GG who i was playing against and if they were premade or not. I only checked enemy team but it appeared that most of the matchs had 2, or 2+2 or 3 Or 2+3 premades. On the last 20 games i did not encounter a single 4 or 5 man premade. However, there was 9/10 games against a 2(or 2X2) or 3 premade. In one game i was with 2 premade of 2: First guy http://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=trinitrion . In the last 20 games, he was with other people 30 times. Wich means, half his games are 3 queues, while other half is DuoQ. Then the other Duo: http://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=marios4671 In the last 20 games, he was with other people 34 times. Wich means, 12/20 of his games are 3 queues, while other half is DuoQ. ------------------------------------------------------------------- SO i started to see a trend. Then i looked up the profiles of masters etc. Just an exemple: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Carry%20for%20Nymka Played half his Game 3 man Queue , other half DuoQ. Actually, most people in the ladder higher than Plat 5 play in premade. ------------------------------------------------------------------- **Conclusion: The best way to climb is to play 3 man or 2 man queue. Because you will very often be against solo people.** People like to play with friends, and that's what most are doing if you OP.GG profiles, most of people don't soloQ. But, is this fair for solo players? Is it representative of the skill of the players ? I let you be the judge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**EDIT: SOME ITEM BUILDS ARE BUGGED CURRENTLY WE WILL TRY TO FIX IT ASAP** ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey you might remember my reddit threads in which I showed [champion builds from Korean] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/44wak2/korean_supports_in_masterchallenger/) Challengers and Master players for every lane, my [Tanky Akali Thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/46e08p/akali_mains_rejoice_koreans_found_you_a_new_top/) or my [weekly winrate in diamond KR] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/46jtyq/weekly_top_10_winrate_in_diamond_korean_soloq_for/) When those threads hit the frontpage I got contacted by u/Apfelmann who wanted to create a Website doing a similiar thing. Due to the big amount of PM asking me do update my build threads i wanted to give it a go. We have been working together for nearly two months now and are proud to present you http://www.koreanbuilds.net The website shows champion builds from korean challenger and master players for the current patch. New data is beeing processed every hour to always display most recent builds, also summoners are beeing updated every day and we even do some manual moderation on which summoners should be included on the site such as the one trick ponies. For 6.5 we already have already more than 1000 different builds you can check out. However the website is still in Beta for now, so if you discover any bugs or have feedback please let us know either by writing us on reddit, or writing an email to the adress listed on the website. Things we are currently thinking about adding in the future: * Skill order * Starting items * Winrate with said champion * Challenger Database priority * Off-Meta builds Highlights ------------------------------------------------------------------- You can also contact me ingame: I CANT PAUSE MOM (euw) ------------------------------------------------------------------- **PS:** One Trick ponies Data is still being processed as i had to do it manually, should be fully updated in a few hours ------------------------------------------------------------------- **EDIT: SOME ITEM BUILDS ARE BUGGED CURRENTLY WE WILL TRY TO FIX IT ASAP**</TEXT>

The early cloth does not matter that much if you have the right runes and against ap you can't really start with another cheap item. With darkseal + biscuit mastery + runic armor you heal 226 HP every pot = 678 hp before first back (not counting the + 10 % duration) If you get spirit visage it will be 260 HP Early ap helps farming with E in hard matchups and bully then in lane (exemple teemo) WHat do you think?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-05-16 09:54:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>A lot of items have it now. What is it really worth? For someone like heimer who has a base regen of 41, 100 % base regen is actually a lot and you can actually reach absurb amounts if you stack items, because it has no cap. The maximum health regen possible is actually with heimer with 681 HP5 , it has a gold value of 24514 by itself. It's basically like if soraka was spamming heals on you non stop. Ideas? For exemple nasus can get a 221 HP5 with a kinda normal build. (Spirit visage, ZZrot, Warmog, Banshee, Iceborn) It's 44hp/s . One pot is 10 hp/s Also fun fact, with the right masteries: Recovery, Runic armor and Perseverance, and 2 rejuvenation beads, heimer at lvl 6 will have 11 HP second, more than one pot constantly running.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-06-18 13:53:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's pretty simple. In mobas, you have your **own** lane, laning phase, your own gold. You are separated from other players (unless in duo lane) , you do your own things until it's time to teamfight/get objectives. Things snowball, one death means a lot. And theres nothing more frustrating than being 3-4 man dove by a premade repeatedly until you are irrevelant and have to endure 30-40 min of pain (and/or flame) In OW, you are always contributing, there's no gold, you can swap champions, always be usefull even when losing and the games are very fast when one sided. Dynamic Q in a moba, to compare with overwatch, means you can get spawncamped for 40 minutes and everyone in your team is playing Mercy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unlucky for me, i pulled both Xeno and MVegeta but don't have the medals, so i went with a fusion team (also took Mvegeta/xeno/brolly as guest/friends). I was pretty excited, but after the first 20 or so wins, not so much. The second day, oh my god, grinding these 80 wins was such a pain. Between the times i died (forgot to senzu because not paying attention), when it froze (pretty often) and the long long grind of 80 wins in 3 days, damn, it's not a good experience. I'm in top 2000 for now with my 80 wins, i hope it's enough to secure me something for tommorow. Btw, wtf are these top scores, are they cheating? It seems physically impossible to achieve such wins + Score in such amount of time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-31 03:11:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>After a little while, you realise that they release stuff too fast so you'll NEVER get everything you want as a F2P. So , if you look back, look at what you need. SVegito. Aoe if you do tournaments and gogeta as lead or another 3 ki leader. What were the worth banners pulling for? Svegito + Gogeta SSBKK + S.Vegito Turles + Xeno + Majin Vegeta (if you like to do tournaments) Why? Simply because you will not have enough stones to pull what you need and you want to focus on ONE thing, the best thing, and that's mono agi, still will be for a little while at least Sure you can try to do Monoteq with SS3 gotenks banner, but you need better cards, while Mono agi can clear everything in the game with average cards and Free cards like Whis. You can even get faster 80 wins on tournament with double vegito lead because counter strike speeds up things (if you don't aim for top scores, hell i made it top 5k this tournament in 80 wins using raindow + double Svegito when i had no guest with Mvegeta or Xeno) Of course you can try to do a single on a banner now and then. So for global F2P , what 's your best bet? Having gogeta (for WT), Keep everything for super vegito, hopefully get an AOE on Turles/Xeno banner then keep your stones for the next broken stuff that will come after Ki leaders (if you have any remaining stones that is :D).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seriously. It's only the SECOND TIME a NA team gets out of group. Be happy WTF? And even if TSM was a bit overhyped, they would probably got out of groups on another group (A/B/C) because i think they were/are still way stronger than c9 and CLG. They got unlucky it happens... even if for me they are still a top 6-8 team. (just a EU fan trying to cheer u up because TSM is still a great team even if they failed they didn't go 1-5 like G2 and i think NA made good progress and NA=EU at the moment unless h2k goes super sayan and pull some miracle)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The biggest thing i'm afraid of, is that getting Dupes is the only way to max out a character, and that having maxed out characters becomes necessary for future content. (from the picture, maxed out character nearly **doubles it's stats**) Dupes should make things easier, but not restrict access to a whole new level of gameplay. Will you really bother hunting down a second Buuhan or Gogeta? With what stone/money? I don't know if they went this way, after such a long time (when a lot of people got rid of their dupes anyway) but i'm not sure if it would be a good decision (or do they intend to aim the game at only the bigeest whales out there?).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If numbers are right it might be impossible to clear with one AOE because if people max out their character with the new system to increase stats they will have LOOoot of Def and HP. Running 2 or 3 AOE + supports might be the best choice, since 2 AOE will most likely kill everyone. I doubt they want to kill AOE because that's their only value in the game. On the other end we could see rainbow teams (like full fusions supers all day) doing pretty good too if it's all about getting supers and aoe are not able to kill everyone. .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They said you can choose your difficulty once you unlocked it. So it will most likely reward a lot more point to go higher. I think they want higher difficulty to stop being speed and more about real fighting. Because let's be real, when i didn't have AOE, on the WT, i would not even look at my phone during fights and spam the orbs buttons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course if you aim for top 10k. But it's way better for someone who has bad cards. Even as a level 1, you can join the tournament and get 2 FREE SSR by farming the level 1 stage. You couldn't do that before. IT IS MORE CASUAL, getting 20 wins is nothing. Makes them addicted to the game, because what new player will gring 80 wins without aoe? It's actually bad for the long time and hardcore players, but for new players it is very good, even if they get bad tournament cards, they have a shot at getting very good ssrs. Hell , on my 3 pulls i got 2 non dupes SSRS (AGL SS3 GT Goku, And TEQ SSB Goku)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If we ignore leader skills, he probably comes right after Svegito. What makes him not god tier, is because he doesn't have the mono lead skill, but he's better than most of them as a card alone. He gets 10000 defense from passive, it makes him a tank. Or , more like, an OFFTANK. To compare, janemba and baby janemba get 5000 def. Is Meta Rildo a tank? If he is then SBKK is one too (meta rildo gets 10 000 def from passive). He has the best links in the game, period. No other unit has that much good links. RFW, SS, OiaF, any other has those (only one, STR SSG Goku)? He's in top 5 or top 10 damage dealers. If we can make rainbow great again, he'll be in the top 3 units to get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Until we know more about the next events on japan, with dupe system etc where maybe we will have way harder fights. But for now, there is no event that you cannot do with a decent (i say decent because with a perfect mono agi you rape everything) mono agi team. TO be fair it's even pointless to pull on anything more unless it's for fun, for collection purpose or whatever. that's how it is, you can get Buuhan, SS3 Gotenks or Shenron they are pretty awesome too and can beat everything with your eyes closed too, but Agi is still the most powerfull in JPN (because buuhan takes forever to kill someone while agl does the same faster). On one hand you can enjoy it, but on the other hand you won't find much big challenge for a few months. On JPN, we are not trying to beat events, but to do them without using a single item...</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-14 13:13:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>- Devs on this game had absolutly no clue that the Svegito Counter would make AGL so broken (actually they never care or balance). (So making Svegito better doesn't matter) - Power level is Irrevelant or we would have PHY black as a way better card, and Beerus would be the rainbows leader. - DBS is far from ending and this is just an arc, there will be more and more powerfull people and power levels. (Read this as: A lot more money to milk for Bamco) - We didn't even get STR and INT demi gods, so it doesn't make sense on a release pattern. - I expect the rainbow leader to be a massive event, with probably all the gods and demigods as scouters in the banner, not some random pulled out of the a$$ in last minute event. I think he'll either be a demigod or a broken nuke rainbow leader (to go along with the new WT) On the other hand, due to his popularity, he has to be broken :/</TEXT>

There will be even more op characters to milk money but what can they do then in the game? + 200% + 6 ki leaders?

    <TEXT>i've seen a lot of talks, how it's good to have gogeta/SSB vegito/SS vegito etc on a team or a bunch of vilains. But Black is AgL, so are LR androids and they link extremly well. Can someone really compare mono AGL to a "Super" or "Extrem" team. Because while Blue Vegito has epic damage potential, he takes a LOT of damage to be able to counter. By my experience, a lot more than SSBKK</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i mean, to get use of Blue Vegito 's passive you have to tank with him, so you have to use items. If events get harder, you'll eventually run out of healing. Maybe an Extrem team can be the best, but a SSB vegito team in the futur i doubt it. Mono teams are good at grinding out their opponent, especially Mono int. But if you can't tank with Blue Vegito to make use of his counter, he's just a second brolly.</TEXT>

And himself is selfefficient and can work as a filler, even being the leader. He is the SUPER leader God lead.

    <TEXT>First, you have to check your units. If you read that LR frieza is the best, well maybe your 4 dupes maxed Gogeta might be way better than your sa10 LR frieza especially in a fight like SSBKK goku. Then you look at analysis, and see the calculations for double Omega shenron being better than Double SS4 goku. Right, on paper. But should you take the same teams to fight Black than to fight SSBKK/Brolly? Hell no. In the first one you will blast thru it with 2 SS4 killing it in 1 rotation, in the second one you will grind it out with Omega.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so i've been playing since Super vegito release on JPN and i have like 7 units (not counting farmable SA) maxed (Svegito, Gogeta, ss rose black, ss3 gotenks, Majin Vegeta and SS4 Vegeta..) So where is the problem? A lot of cards you can't even use the whole free paths making them bad compared to farmable SA. See the problem with for exemple AGL Arale vs AGL Ultimate Gohan. Same tier cards, but why would i ever use gohan when arale had free SA 10? tdlr: need more elder Kais</TEXT>

It's cool that something is designed for hardcore players i'd say "at last", but we should not act like most people will get all the rewards of the new mode, because they won't (if things stay that way ofc).

    <TEXT>What i love is that you can make so much different teams able to clear events. On the other hand, on a strategic point of view, it's a bit dull. When SS4 came out i got into an argument with one of the "Analysis guys" (don't remember who) who was thinking Omega lead + SS4 goku was better. It made sense, with the old meta in mind but My point was that double SS4 was way better because you would just tear things appart. Sadly i was right. Now the strategic is basically this: SS4 goku? Put him next to SS3 GT goku and win Cooler? Put him next to FP Frieza and win LR gohan? Press butons and win. I'd like more emphasis on tanks, sealers, wall breakers, new links, i don't know but something else than Damage, Damage , Damage.</TEXT>

Boss rush should have a chance to drop elder kais, it's long enough, useless after you completed it once. Drop rate should increase with difficulty. It would also discourage rerolls even more with the time spent to farm all those SA Edit: People think it will be abused with mods but battlefield too. So make it a 3 times a day thing then....Battlefield is farmed with mods and it would be the same thing... Or make Boss rush "coins" the same way battle field has coins, to buy elder kais</TEXT>

Core units: Lux , Jax, Irelia, janna, Morgana chosen divine, or a divine sword for 6 divine at 8 You can divine talon but i usually swap him when i get Yone. then WW and Lee sin. Janna chosen works well if you get a divine sword. Dont get wukong unless you have him early at 2\* with other divine units. Morgana is your main carry but lux with her buff at 3stars can do work and WW can be your hard carry but others too, even jax, with the right items. only problem i had was mages but then you itemise against them, and position well it can be done unless they have highrolled. Have to really spread units fonr arhi.</TEXT>
