    <TITLE>Beauty channel I haven't seen on youtube</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-01 23:59:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I love watching beauty videos on YouTube, not so much the big big influencers but more small channels and such, and I have been looking so hard for a channel that caters to women who work in hot, humid conditions. For instance I am a cook, and I pretty much never wear makeup to work not because I don't feel comfortable doing so, but because it is so hard to find products that will truly last and hold up to the heat that I am around on a daily basis like fryers, grills, a 450 degree oven, and the overall ambient heat that comes from working in such a space. I can imagine there are a lot of women in this industry also and even in other industries that have similar conditions and I have yet to find any channel or even video that is specific to those working conditions, I always end up finding videos that are for very minimal outdoor summer makeup. I'm thinking about starting my own channel dedicated to that market since I have yet to find anything similar, would anybody else find that interesting or useful?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I adore the pixi glow tonic! I don't use it daily because I feel that would be too harsh on my super reactive skin but nothing helps my acne more and as an added bonus it is safe for pregnant women, it is HARD out here for mamas with acne prone skin because salicylic acid and BP along with retinoids aren't safe for us!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its damn near impossible for me to find a foundation that won't smear or a mascara that won't raccoon eye after a full shift. I understand most people don't have such high demands of a makeup product but I honestly don't think lasting 7 hours in humidity is too much to ask! I think it would benefit a lot of people to see what products truly will last to their claims of longwearing when truly put to the test in such a workplace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was able to find heaps of videos for work appropriate makeup for those with less environmentally challenging conditions like those with office jobs and the like, a full on face would also look pretty out of place in my workplace, most shadows even with the best primers out there will still slip and slide around on my skin once my face contacts that heat for a long enough period. There is nothing more brutal than being super busy doing my job and I feel my eye makeup start to slide into my eyes or my mascara start flaking off into my eyes but I can't just abandon my table to go fix it, but I do have customer interaction sometimes so I don't even know what's worse no makeup or makeup sliding all over the place, I probably look rough as hell either way  #128514;</TEXT>

I couldn't even use 2 products in the last box because they sent a vitamin and a salicylic acid product, I'm pregnant so both of those things were an automatic fail. The one thing that was cool that they sent was the Suva shadow pan but the first one arrived broken and they didnt send the same shade as a replacement so instead of a cool color I didnt already have in my collection I ended up with another warm toned brown shimmer, who doesn't have a million of those already? I'm definitely gonna cancel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would imagine they would have to be related financially at least somewhat in order to be using the same name as the retail stores and to share a website with the retail stores, as well as to offer the discount that subscribers are offered with each order placed outside of the subscription box. I imagine the boxes have little to do with the everyday dealings of the stores with so many locations it just makes more sense that the higher ups in the company deal with that. It just struck me as very odd that a place with over a dozen locations within NYC that has hundreds of products listed on their website would be sold out of EVERYTHING. I cant imagine they draw their stock from terribly different suppliers for both the stores and the boxes as they offer the brands that they are supposed to stock in their boxes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's possible too! If the online store does dissolve you would think they would inform the subscribers as soon as possible, since the discount on the website is touted as a perk for subscribers to the box. Maybe so many people signed up when they opened the waitlist that it isnt financially feasible for them to offer that discount any longer.</TEXT>

My theory is that it's someone else in Slipknot that isnt as well known, they say in the last episode that "they'll prove they can be the main attraction" Corey is the lead singer, the main attraction so to speak. The one that fits the height is Shawn. Shawn was the drummer for the dirty little rabbits also. I'm not 100% convinced its him, but I think I'm on to something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find doing The Big Declutter was way too overwhelming for me. I had so much stuff over so many years of collecting and it didnt make sense to cycle out in an instant things it took me years to acquire, I feel that would have triggered a panic spending spree in myself as well. What I do is a gradual decision making process, I use a monthly makeup set up where I go through my collection and choose to use things I want to use or haven't used in a while. Sometimes I find products that I just dont love or colors that I don't find flattering to me anymore and i pass them on to someone that will appreciate them or dispose of them if necessary. It is much less overwhelming to pick up one lipstick per day and say do I still like this? Will I use this more than once a year? Do I find this flattering? Do I have a lipstick in this exact shade already in my collection, but maybe in a different formula? I've been doing that over the past few months and honestly I've gotten rid of quite a lot of things and felt no guilt at all, no panic. Taking your time with it really allows you to give yourself permission to say it's ok to give this up now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Finding the makeup panning community has really helped me continue to be interested in makeup without having that feeling of I need to buy everything I want everything, I used to be like that several years ago and I amassed an absolutely insane collection. Finding the panning community has really helped me understand that makeup has an expiration date and you only have one face, unless you're a pro you're likely only doing makeup on yourself, and since I had kids I dont spend nearly as much time on doing makeup as I used to because I chose to prioritize other things now like skincare over makeup. I love watching panners and seeing how fast or slow a certain product takes them and then seeing someone else use the same product and how much longer or shorter it takes them. Theres a real focus on using what you have and using what makes you happy. Its given me the courage to dip into limited edition products that I wont be able to replace because there's no point in letting it sit and expire.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just finished S7 Finale, and I have feelings.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-10 18:02:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi folks just found this forum and I am excited to talk to other fans of the show. The ending of the season finale had me absolutely livid and I'm wondering if anybody had some theories as to why Liz would appear to be aligning with her mother? Granted Reddington has put her through a lot, but he is the one who has been her silent (up until Season 1) benefactor, ensuring she had the things she needed to live a safe and happy life, making sure nobody could ever put together that she was Katarina Rostovas daughter, Liz didn't even know until Reddington came into her life! Contrast that with her mother, who moved in next door to spy on her and Agnes, drove away the very qualified nanny, put Agnes in harms way multiple times, nearly killed Reddington multiple times, what has she done to earn this trust from Liz? Not harming Agnes when she was in her care is a very low bar to turn on the man who has, like it or not, been solely responsible for her health and safety as well as Agnes thus far. He has well proven that he will do things that will anger Liz and even hurt Liz emotionally to protect Agnes at any cost and Katarina comes waltzing in and puts them all in danger and suddenly Liz is mommy's little girl? Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I am livid at the idea that shes going to turn on Reddington after the huge risks he's taken specifically for Liz and Agnes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So much of this show appeared to be a build up to Liz finally embracing the world Reddington lives in and making peace with his ethics vs her own, but her own have so wildly flip flopped this season, it took multiple seasons for her to even begin to trust Reddington. Time and time again he has always been honest with Liz, withholding certain information no doubt, but if there's one thing we can deduce from these last 7 seasons is that nothing Raymond does is an accident, if he's withholding something from Liz its usually for a damn good reason. I can't shake the feeling of distrust that I have for Katarina, I don't believe she wants what's best for Liz or Agnes, She wants what is best for herself and I dont think she cares who or what she needs to endanger to get there. You would think Liz would be less trusting and even more wary after everything she and Reddington went through this past 2 seasons, his arrest, his near death, finally saying that she loved him. Its like they completely flushed 3 seasons of plot development down the toilet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really upsets me the completely illogical and often childlike thought process that comes so often from Liz, shes supposed to be an amazing super agent with unparalleled profiling and investigative skills, and then consistently makes the worst possible decision for the situation. I honestly think this show would improve tenfold if Liz was removed as a main character and the focus was brought solely upon Reddington and Dembe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really enjoy the actress that plays Liz and I think the writers are doing her personally a huge disservice in writing her character this way, its like she's simultaneously a grown woman and an FBI agent, but also a wreck less 15 year old trying to make their way around life. I think in the earlier seasons like when she's accused of being a spy and on the most wanted list (which by the way they never cleared up how in the hell she's continuing to life and work as normal when there was a nationwide manhunt for her and her face along with Reddingtons graced every newspaper and TV station, they just moved on like she would totally be able to live a normal life after that) I think those episodes show her range and versatility a LOT more than the past several seasons, her character was much more well written when we didn't know as much about her as we do now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is certainly a very human element to Liz that I can appreciate, she's not had a very easy time and for the last however many years has elapsed on the show, I think like 7ish? Her job and her personal life have intersected in a very complicated and stressful way and I do think they do a really good job of putting into perspective the mental toll that would take on even the strongest willed person, to continue to go through what she has gone through and still be reporting to work and holding together some semblance of normalcy for Agnes, that itself is a very impressive thing about Liz. But for an agent working working at a black site going after some of the most dangerous people in the world? I dont know, her presence in the field seems unrealistic to me and it just bothers me a little bit that for a long while there Liz was definitely not ok and everyone around her continued like they didn't see that happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was sort of hard to watch, but under the circumstances I understand they had to do the best they could in the time period they were given. I'm sure it wasn't easy to do but the animation was just bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RIGHT? There was barely any highlighters even on the market in 2010, one of the first i distinctly remember was the elf multiuse sticks that I believe they discontinued several years ago, this was back when ALL elf products were just $1, I had a lilac one. In 2010 big almost spidery lashes were huge thats when I saw folks starting to wear lashes for everyday looks and being super super bronzed was very trendy like damn near orange bronze.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hint at Redarina in Season 1 that made me chuckle</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:33:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started to re watch from the beginning to see things from a fresher perspective and to notice things I might not have the first time. I know there's a love hate relationship with this theory and though it is one of my favorite theories I do realize its unlikely to be the end result of the show though I do have great fun theorizing about it. In season 1 episode 2 when we first meet Dembe and Luli, Reddington greets Luli with a fairly intimate kiss. Then turns to Ressler and says "Watch yourself with her Donald, she hates men. Cops most of all". Made me laugh pretty hard this time around, it seems like such a throw away punchline from the perspective of the 2nd episode of the show, but with the knowledge of having seen the whole series already and knowing the Redarina theory it had me in stitches.</TEXT>
