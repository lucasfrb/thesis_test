    <TEXT>Can anyone point me to some YouTube videos that are extremely tense and thrilling to watch. Preferably ones that are based in real life and on real life situations. So no short films, as you go into them with the knowledge that they are staged. For example, I really enjoy the 24 hours in *insert store name here*, because people are constantly in a state of fear over whether they may be caught or not. There is a sense of disorientation and excitement as people move around the store, unsure of whether they are being watched by security cameras or not. In particular the '24 Hours in Area 51 attempt by a group of bloggers' (can't remember their name) is terrifying to watch. They are unsure of what technology the US Government can use to track them. When they enter Area 51, they are absolutely certain that the Us Government have the right to shoot and kill. They think that drones may be following them and that there are trackers in the road. When the enter the back gate of Area 51, they are stopped by a Jeep, which comes out to them. They then have to get away. However there are buffalo on either side of the road, who may block them from escaping. This is all in the dark, in the middle of nowhere as well, which adds to the thrills. Rather an open question I know. So to summarise what are you favourite YouTube videos that are based on real life situations and encounters that involve a sense of real and prolonged sense of danger, uncertainty and disorientation?. I know this is a really open and vague question, so these situations could be the kind of thing I'm looking for: -Someone is walking through South Central LA late at night, when suddenly all the lights go off during a power cut. -Someone is out walking in the countryside, when suddenly the tornado sirens go off. Their car won't start, and there are no nearby buildings to run to. - Some of the examples of situations that could fit this criteria could include: someone walking through South Central LA late at night, with no-one about, when the power suddenly goes out; or someone out walking in the countryside, when a tornado suddenly approaches and they are frantically looking for somewhere to hide. That is the sort of thing I'm after. I'm definitely not into anything too horror or supernaturally based, but stuff grounded in real life events.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help Requested in Regards to General University Work Situation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-12 19:00:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would really appreciate some help on the following situation, which I think is heavily shaped by the fact that I am a confirmed INTJ. Bascially I've got two bits of university work due in on the 18th and 19th of April, which are 3,000 and 2,500 word tasks, respectively, and I haven't done one word on them yet. My problem is that my mind just won't enage. Because I'm in my final semester, it seems like my mind has already decided that I have passed my degree and as a result it's not worth putting any effort in to anything. My mind has remained disengaged from the outside world and has refused to engage with the fact that these dealines really are real and they geuinely are coming up. I have tried many tactics, such as scaring myself with false nearer deadlines, and putting a list of deadlines right in front of my face, but the realisation of actually having to do these tasks has not hit me. I have also experinced signs of depression, such as not being interested in the real world in general, which I think as a result of this general situation. My mind seems to be set in a permenant state of relaxation (or possibly self-denial?), which I can't escape from. The default activity is relaxation, whereas the non-default activity is working. It was the complete opposite way round in 2nd and 3rd year. In 2nd and 3rd year I also used to be terrified of deadlines and of failing and authority. Now those things just don't seem to bother me in the slighest. I also do feel to some extent, that I am stuck inside my own head and can't quite understand or explain what is going on. I am also a confirmed perfectionist if that explains anything. Any help greately appreciated</TEXT>

    <TITLE>INTJ Christian Questions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-06 14:01:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Guys, Based on the fact that I've noticed I've have many, many, INTJ traits I have a couple of problems that I'd like help with. Obviously I'm not living out the whole INTJ thing as an identity, it's just that this will help me understand how my own mind works. Sometimes I just cannot be bothered to live out the Christian life. I've always had a problem with short- temperedness and with wanting to get stuff done quickly. I think this makes it hard for me to be a Christian because it requires SOOOO much perservance and effort at times which I simply don't have at times. As C.S Lewis says, there are points at which I genuinely would rather make mud pies than go to the seaside. As an INTJ, I've read that we tend to be highly efficient, in that we are extremely reluctant to expend energy over anything, unless we are absolutely sure of the results. Call it an elaborate form of laziness; what's in it for me, says my heart? I have no desire to change at times. Secondly, as per the standard INTJ character, I'm fiercely independent. Sometimes I cannot see the benefit of going to church, when my mind treats social interactions and friendships as an unnecessary extra, which get in the way of your own visions and objectives. Going back to the first point, my mind sometimes decides that it is not work expending the amount of energy required to go to church, to get what I could otherwise get myself by reading the Bible on my own terms. Thirdly, I'm a rotten perfectionist, which means that almost daily I think that I've failed at being a Christian. But equally I am frustrated that I have no conviction over some sins. So to summarise, my main problems are: Laziness, perfectionism and frustration. I'm well aware that Christ calls me to take up my cross daily, but sometimes I just can be bothered to do this, unless the benefits of it, explicitly outweigh the negatives (maybe I'm being too rational and too logical). It's so fiddly sometimes. Am I basing my Christian experience too much on feelings, rather than on fact? I've had moments when I've been staggered by God's grace; that he could possibly save us when you consider how angry he is at our sin. As far as I am aware I think I'm saved. When I was 15 (I'm 22 now) I suddenly had an awareness that the whole Christian faith was a transcendent objective reality for all times and places. I had a new desire to please God and definitely felt a new calmness and a feeling that everything in life was trivial compared to knowing God. I HAVE to tell all my friends; I have too! I don't want them to perish and I want them to know this new life! However that 'feeling' faded after 2 months, so I don't know whether this whole thing was a subjective emotive illusion. I do also suffer from Aspergers Syndrome and Dyspraxia, and am very shy and highly, highly emotive, registering as an official Highly Sensitive Person. Any help greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

If we're talking Goa/proper full on Psy-Trance, that's a whole different story. It's very associated with alternative spirituality and hypnotism and drugs.

    <TEXT>Hi guys, First of all I know this is an audiophile message board, but I'm in need of some super basic advice. I do care about sound quality and would like to maximise the potential of my 4.2 unit, but I'm not super-obsessed, as it were. I've got a Panasonic SC-HT80 Soundbase, which sits below your TV. It has two bass amplifiers and two full range front speakers built into the unit. It's total power output is 120w, with 60 of those watts being accounted for by the two subwoofers. For me , everything is also done via HDMI, with no analog connections whatsoever, as per the recommendations of the guy in the shop. There are RCA and 3.5 inputs but I don't use these, as apparently it would prevent you from having virtual surround. If you need any more info here's the link from the official Panasonic website: http://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/home-entertainment/home-cinema-systems/sc-hte80eb.html There's tons of settings and jargon which I don't understand; apparently the unit is particularly high tech and has lots of special features. According to Trusted Reviews, it features 'built-in Dolby Digital and DTS decoders, Pro Logic II and Virtual Speaker processing and even handles up to 7.1-channel PCM via HDMI'. What do these terms even mean? I mainly stream stuff on a Fire Stick, and on various apps on it. There's a button that you can press down on the remote control to show you what type of audio input you are using, and for everything I've watched, it's indicated that it's a PCM input (whatever that means). So down to buisness.......here's a list of all the audio settings. I would like to have some explanation of what you think they mean and what they do. I will also write my interpretation of what I think they mean. SOUND MOD: This is an EQ setting and you can pick from Music, Cinema, News, Stereo, Standard and Stadium. SUBWOOFER: This is the level of the subwoofer, simply put. You can pick from four levels. Does this relate to the amount of global bass being produced, or does it just refer to the intensity at which the existing bass level is pumped out? DIALOG: I THINK this must refer to treble levels- can anyone confirm. Again, you can pick from four levels. H Bass- According to Panasonic this adds dynamic bass to low frequency audio....whatever that means. Can someone please explain? I read on the internet that someone thinks that these dialogue/subwoofer levels are actually boosters rather than level adjusters. 3D Clear Dialouge: not sure what this means. I assume it refers to boosting the dialogue AGC- Auto Gain Control- no idea what this means. Apparently it's a useful tool to have on at low volumes. What difference does it make exactly? Low Volume Mode- again apparently this boosts speech at low levels. But how is this different from the 3D Clear Dialouge option exactly? So basically I'm not sure how to start tuning. Would it be advisable to start with the dialogue and bass levels, then move on the settings over gain and high bass etc and then EQ? Is there a particular order to do it in? So far all the combinations I had put together either sound too trebely and bright or too boomy and bassy. The range of reviews over the internet also say pretty much the same thing; some people think the unit it's too bassy, whilst others think that it's not bassy enough. Are there basic rules to hi-fi tuning as well. For example should there be a certain distance between the trebles and the bass. Am I being too obsessive full stop?

    <TITLE>Lots of Questions in Regards to a Panasonic SC-HT80</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-13 21:39:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, First of all I know this is an audiophile message board, but I'm in need of some super basic advice. I do care about sound quality and would like to maximise the potential of my 4.2 unit, but I'm not super-obsessed, as it were. I've got a Panasonic SC-HT80 Soundbase, which sits below your TV. It has two bass amplifiers and two full range front speakers built into the unit. It's total power output is 120w, with 60 of those watts being accounted for by the two subwoofers. For me , everything is also done via HDMI, with no analog connections whatsoever, as per the recommendations of the guy in the shop. There are RCA and 3.5 inputs but I don't use these, as apparently it would prevent you from having virtual surround. If you need any more info here's the link from the official Panasonic website: http://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/home-entertainment/home-cinema-systems/sc-hte80eb.html There's tons of settings and jargon which I don't understand; apparently the unit is particularly high tech and has lots of special features. According to Trusted Reviews, it features 'built-in Dolby Digital and DTS decoders, Pro Logic II and Virtual Speaker processing and even handles up to 7.1-channel PCM via HDMI'. What do these terms even mean? I mainly stream stuff on a Fire Stick, and on various apps on it. There's a button that you can press down on the remote control to show you what type of audio input you are using, and for everything I've watched, it's indicated that it's a PCM input (whatever that means). So down to buisness.......here's a list of all the audio settings. I would like to have some explanation of what you think they mean and what they do. I will also write my interpretation of what I think they mean. SOUND MOD: This is an EQ setting and you can pick from Music, Cinema, News, Stereo, Standard and Stadium. SUBWOOFER: This is the level of the subwoofer, simply put. You can pick from four levels.

    <TITLE>Lots of Questions About Sound</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-31 19:56:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all I have a Panasonic SC-HTE80 and an Amazon Fire Stick (not the 4k version). The sound system supports DTS and Dolby Digital and is connected over an ARC HDMI channel I notice that there on the Amazon Fire Stick there are four sound options: one is automatic, one is Dolby Digital and one is Dolby Digital Plus from memory. Now since having the device I have had it on the automatic setting, which I assume produces Dolby Digital Plus sound. The input on my sound system has always come up as 'PCM'. First question: what does PCM mean? Second question: if the sound system is really producing 5.1 sound, shouldn't the device be displaying 'PCM with multi-channel PCM, rather than just 'PCM as it normally does'. The reason I say this is because when I watched a Blu-Ray on my PS4, the box of which claims is 5.1, my device showed 'PCM with multi-channel PCM. Second question, is is true that the Fire Stick doesn't produce DTS. Because when I have the Amazon Video app my PS4 it sounds a lot better. This is beacuse on the PS4 sound settings it allows you to choose from 'linear PCM, bitstream Dolby (which I assume means Dolby Digital), and DTS (which I have it set on). I have tested the Amazon Fire stick on a couple of movies vs. the Amazon Video App on PS4 and the PS4 app does actually sound a lot of better. Can anyone confirm any of this? Overall I'm quite confused. Also does the 4K version of the Fire Stick produce DTS. If it does I would buy it an a heartbeat!</TEXT>

Changing to that made the audio receiver display 'Dolby Digital' as the sound output. I assume that 'compressed' is another word for bitstream.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why Does Trance Get Such a Bad Reputation (In the UK)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-03 14:33:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>As above. In my EDM society at my UK university, literally everyone listens to House and Techno. If you play any song that falls out of the House and Techno airspace you are immediately looked down upon. There's not even a single mention of anything vaguely progressive, melodic or atmospheric. I respect that people have different tastes, and not everyone likes Trance, but literally not a single person has a vague idea of what Trance is. I am absolutely convinced that some people there seriously think that the genre hasn't progressed since 1999. I quite understand there was a point in which Trance become super-commercialised and an embarrasment in 2001-2003 in the UK, and maybe people want to distance themsevles from this. But if anything, Trance is actually more underground and therefore more high quality than it's ever been. I also have a bit of theory. In the UK people have a bit of stiff-upper lip and are hard to be emotionally moved. Could that be why there's such an obsession with Techno and House in the UK? Do people think they have the right to dismiss Trance, as 'we've been there, and done that'; Oakenfold and co were great in the 90s, but it's an embarrassing thing for middle aged fat people who can't dance and we've moved on' Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok :) Can you recommend me some good tracks. I'm always open to new recommendations. And to be quite honest I think we can let our subjective biases effect how we feel about a whole era of Trance. For example I find Anjunabeats 1, which was released back in 2003, to sound extremely homogenous. Yet, I also find stuff released on FSOE to be quite generic at times. I'm a weird guy. Furthermore in 1999, which is considered to be the golden age of Trance, lots of music critics said that all Trance sounded exactly the same. It is actually very frustrating. My taste seems to be ultra-specific, because I've exhausted all the good tracks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As above. What do you think? I think it's dangerously close to selling 'Christianity as a lifestyle'; feel bad about your life, became a Christian and feel happier and more satisfied is the mantra of HTB Brompton. There isn't enough emphasis on sin and judgement. There is also very little mention of repentance and what it means to take up your cross and follow Jesus. Whilst some of the Alpha videos certainly helped me in my first year of university, I think Christianity Explored is a far, far stronger choice for conservative evangelical churches.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HTB Brompton is a big charismatic church in London who pioneered the Alpha programme. That's interesting about what you said about Alpha leading into discipleship groups. I guess my point was that Alpha in it's default form doesn't really tackle the issue of repentance- some churches do adapt it, because it does need modifying me thinks. I think that a lot of churches forget that Alpha was originally a programme for rusty church goers, rather the completely un-churched.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I'd need to know the model of your TV to see if it's accurate. Also remember that a good contrast ratio helps with viewing a TV in the dark. So if it looks weird in a poorly lit room it is likely it doesn't have a good contrast ratio regardless of what number you're given for the TV.  gt; Sure it's a Hitachi 32HYT46U. Here's the web page with further info on contrast ratio etc.: http://www.hitachidigitalmedia.com/en-gb/discontinued-products/led-tvs/32-81cm/32hyt46u</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-13 20:47:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, please give me instructions which are simple as possible. Have Windows 7 64 bit installed on my C: Drive for about 4 years. Also bought an OCZ Vertex 4 64GB about 2 years ago. Have been using that for just games. However since I can only fit about 1 or 2 games on the SSD, I have decided that it would be just better to use it as a boot drive. What would I need to to to transfer the Windows 7 install from the HDD to the SSD? Can I just migrate it? I have the original CD, but it's an OEM version, so it's single use only. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TITLE>INTJ or Aspergers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-22 14:07:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I was diagnosed as having Aspergers when I was 5 years old, as I didn't really play with my classmates by default. I showed little or no interest in other people's emotions either, being stuck in my own little world most of the time. My question is could I have been misdiagnosed?. What I mean by this, is could the symptoms mentioned above just be personality traits rather than an actual Autistic Spectrum Disorder? I've read that an INTJ character is very similar to the signs of Aspergers: being very rational and inward looking. I've done the Myers Briggs test multiple times and have come out as INTJ every time. I also have Dyspraxia and am an HSP. Can anyone provide any insight?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Quick Question About Contrast Ratios/Vibrancy</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-23 12:56:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, two questions: 1) I am thinking of getting a new TV to replace my Hitachi one (can provide model number on request), which has a sub-par native contrast ratio of 1:1600. I have always thought that the picture quality didn't look too good, despite having contrast set on max, the brightness not being set too high etc; I just have never had quite the right words to describe it. We have another TV downstairs, which is a Sony Bravia KDL 32EX723, which I thought I would compare the film the 'Nut Job' streamed on an Amazon Prime Stick on Amazon Instant Video, to see what potential improvement it would lead to if I upgraded my Hitachi TV. The picture did look significantly better. However I do not know what contrast ratio the Sony Bravia TV is. On their website they simply state that it is 'mega contrast ratio', which I assume relates to an effectively infinite dynamic contrast ratio (not native). Can anyone advise on what contrast ratio they think the telly might have? 2) Secondly why do TVs in Currys/PC World (Best Buy in the US) always look so vibrant? Is it that they deliberately showcase the ones with really high contrast ratios? I heard also that the trick is to turn the backlight to the maximum setting. Many thanks</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-11-21 10:33:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there r/TrueChristian. I am an INTJ, which means that by default I am a bit of rationalist, find feelings futile, fleeting and stupid and find inter-personal relationships very, very, very hard to understand and cultivate, beyond a consumerist, give and take mentality. I certainly do not limit myself to living only this definition, and I perfectly willing to be changed by God into who he wants me to be. There have certainly been one or two definite moments where I have really understood how much God loves me, in terms of the otherwise unsolvable problem of my unholiness compared to God's holiness. However the problem for me is that it seems very, very hard to cultivate a relationship with God. As mentioned previously, by default, I interpret all human relationships in binary terms, and don't understand that feelings exist or that people have them or that 'people are people'. This transfers into my Christian life and into my understanding of God. I HAVE become a lot better at praying, as I have slowly learnt that praying isn't about 'getting stuff from God' but a way of showing God that you submit to him. But whenever I try and read the Bible as God's Word and to try and get to know him, it just turns into textbook-reading activity. Any help is greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ongoing Fatigue Question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-12 11:17:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, Basically I think I'm now very fatigued as a result of past stress and consistent worry going on for about a month of two due to life events. The source of the worry is now no longer there. I've read that the adrenaline released can send you into overdrive and only when this subsides do you really begin to feel the effects. I have impaired judgement and reaction time and have seem myself getting more emotional/moodier over stuff that doesn't usually have much of an impact on me, so I'm fairly sure it's fatigue. I am also getting a good amount of sleep every night (usually around 8\-9 hours). So my question is when will this fatigue pass and what is the best way to help it on its way to dissipate?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cripping Performance Question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-11 12:30:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys. As above. I find that when my cities begin to reach the 30-40k population mark, the frame rate takes an absolute nosedive, especially at night. I am also running maybe around 50 Steam Workshop mods, and around 300 Steam Workshop custom assets. I have a fairly beefy PC, and bear in mind I am running everything on maximum graphics settings. PC SPECS: * i5 2500k OC'd to 4.3GHz * 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz RAM * 4GB GeForce GTX 970 STRIXX Edition, Core Clock and Memory Clock OC'D quite a bit * SanDisk Ulra II 480GB SSD- which Cities Skylines is loaded on to * Windows 10 Pro 64 bit What would be some tips to improve performance, preferably without ditching too many of the mods and assets mentioned? Would toning down some of the graphics settings to high and medium (rather than very high) make much of a difference? Finally are there any mods that would make a difference. I know someone mentioned on the Steam forums about the Dynamic Resolution mod?  #8203; Many thanks  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Yes, a 60Hz monitor will only display 60fps. However Nvidia Fast Sync and AMD Enhanced Sync will be rendering 120 fps or more, and then discarding the old frames and showing the newest ones. So the game can be more responsive if you can run it at 120 fps or higher.  #8203;  #8203; That is the plan.</TEXT>

For example i was more talkative, i was louder for some reason lol, and i sometimes felt like i slurred my words a tiny bit. I would feel tired but not in an overwhelming sense. Yep.

Likewise in the real theory test, there's not an unlimited question bank. So in other words, you kind of learn the correct answers through trial and error.....that's one way of doing it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Question About the Affect of Steam Sales on Other Key Sites</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-28 15:40:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, Quick question about the affect of Steam Sales on other key sites. As an example Dishonored 2 is currently retailing for the discounted price of  #163;14.99 on Steam. But after using a CD key comparison tool, the lowest price on the wider internet is currently  #163;6.12. Now after looking at graphs #1 and #2, I think we can agree that the price of  #163;6.12 is a very significant and sudden drop in price, which is almost certainly a result of the Steam Sale. My question is that after the Steam Sale is over, and Dishonored 2 returns to its regular price of  #163;29.99 on Steam, will the the lowest price on the wider internet also return to roughly the same as how it was prior to the Steam Sale (i.e: around  #163;14.14 as seen on graph #2 below). What has happened in previous years, and with other games? Should I act now to secure this deal, or can I afford to wait, with no risk of the price on the wider internet going up from what it currently is? Does the Steam Sale bring key prices down permanently on the wider internet?  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;  #8203;  #8203; [Graph #1:The current price. The very recent plummet in price leads me to strongly suspect that the affect of the Steam sale has had an impact.](https://preview.redd.it/sd635dlt34731.png?width=1911 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=f7df3a7d4393be7e1e25d31f6d2119f18e56eef1)  #8203;  #8203; [Graph #2: The most recent data point available, prior to today. I suspect that this is before the Steam sale began.](https://preview.redd.it/40amk90594731.png?width=1917 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=8a57b7230824cbf8a3851ea23e3a72f1620d2ef1)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Video Games and Violence- A Quote for Discussion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-28 21:41:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I'm gonna ask a question:  #8203; Below is a quote from an article on Evangelicals Now, a British Christian magazine, about video games. There is a specific section on video game violence. I'd like you to try and make sense of what its trying to say, and would also like you to hear your responses to it. I'm particularly unsure about quite what the text in bold means.  #8203;  gt;*'Advances in technology mean that the next generation of video games can feature photo-realistic graphics and, in some cases, violent content or adult themes. Expect more tabloid headlines like, #160; #8216;Grand Theft Auto 5 #160;torture row: teachers slam scenes of extreme violence in most expensive game ever made #8217;.* *The main difference between the Hollywood blockbuster film and gaming in 2013 is that now you can interact with the virtual worlds of Xbox One and PS4 game consoles. Fancy winning the Champions League as Barcelona football club in #160;FIFA 13? Go for it! Perhaps overseeing an expansive military operation is more your thing? Then #160;Battlefield 4 #160;is for you. Want to go on a city-wide murderous rampage? You #8217;re in luck! #160;Grand Theft Auto 5 #160;just came out.* ***In the Old Testament there is always an evaluation of violence: it is either God #8217;s right judgment on sin or the violence itself is clearly demonstrated to be evil. However, violence in video games either happens in an amoral context or no moral context at all.*** *There are some challenges ahead and some titles are clearly not appropriate for all people. Just as with the film industry, video games are regulated and suitability advice is given to parents via the PEGI (Pan European Game Information) mark on the cover of each game'.*  #8203; I can send people the link to the original article if you are interested (pretty sure I'm not allowed to post links)  #8203; Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As above. I've found that buy and large games which have deep game play, interesting story and characters, and provocative themes are more often than not 'M' rated? There are definitely exceptions (racing and sports and some action games), but this in general is my perception. For instance: * Red Dead Redemption 2: M * The Witcher 3: M * GTA V: M * Detroit Become Human: M * Metro 2033 Redux: M * Skyrim: M * Gears of War 4: M * Fallout 4: M * Deus Ex Mankind Divided: M * The Last Of Us: M * Bioshock 1, 2  amp; 3: M * L.A Noire: M * Watch Dogs 1  amp; 2: M * Metal Gear Solid V: M * Cyberpunk 2077: M * Mafia III: M * Dying Light: M * Borderlands games: M * Rise of the Tomb Raider/ Shadow of the Tomb Raider: M * Saints Row IV: M * Dead Island: M * Rage: M * Dead Rising 4: M * Dead Space Games: M * God of War PS4: M * Left 4 Dead 2: M * Half Life 2: M * Deus Ex: Mankind Divided: M * Battlefield 1: M * AC: Origins: M * Rainbow Six Siege: M * Wolfenstein Games: M * Doom: M * Yakuza 0: M * Sleeping Dogs: M  #8203;  #8203; Why is this do you think this is?

    <TEXT>Oh I agree! I play a range of games. I don't deliberately seek out the most violent ones for the mere fact that they are violent and I get some sort of sadistic pleasure out of them. Its just tend to find that particularly being a PC/PS4 gamer that quite a lot of the games with good story, deep gameplay, provocative themes etc tend to be M/18 rated. Now interestingly on the Wii, its the other way round. The games which are really good tend NOT to be massiely violent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Provocative themes will typically get a game rated M. ESRB seems to be more strict about that stuff than they used to be and so anything more than mild flirting or innuendo will get the M rating. And in the UK, if you even use the word 'd\*\*\*n or s\*\*t once, it will an instant PEGI 12.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, Up until I got an invite for Galaxy 2.0, I used GameRoom. Gameroom enables you to create links to .exe files which lay outside of regular launchers (Steam, Origin, UPlay etc.). This was quite convenient for me as I have quite a few games which are installed off physical CDs. Is there a similar feature in GOG Galaxy 2.0? Will it be added at some point? Might there be a work around (i.e: create a link to an .exe located outside of steam, and then import this into Galaxy)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Queue times on the app are normally less accurate than the queue board in front of the ride, however both update very frequently and are measured very accurately. The queue board time is measured by a random group of guests being handed a card that says what time they entered, and the ride ops will check what time they get on the ride. The app measures queue times using bluetooth, it detects when you enter and exit the queue. Bluetooth? Don't you mean location tracking. I can't think a lot of people have bluetooth turned on....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Question About The Feeling of 'Weightiness'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-29 10:31:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>What's the feeling of weightiness that you get, which increases the further you get down a drop? It seems to vary depending on the coaster. For instance on something like Galatica or Nemesis at Alton Towers the feeling seems not be very strong, probably because the drop isn't very long. Correct? What's the science behind this? Also, weirdly I love rollercoasters, going fast etc. but weirdly not the feeling of weightiness, particularly on the first drop. How can I overcome this? As its really stopping me from fully enjoying coasters.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-17 16:22:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, How do people find driving with Dyspraxia? I additionally have Aspergers as well, so I think this contributes to a significant degree to the below situations: I found lessons a breeze, and passed the UK test first time no problem. Post-lesson, things have generally been pretty good when being given directions by a parent sitting beside me. I love driving, and plan to get a hot-hatch when I have the money However, I have no real experience of driving on my own, outside of a pretty structured setting. I imagine there will be some mental conflict between thinking about directions vs. immediate actions in the here and now for instance. I sort of don't know how to do things on the fly. Can anyone relate to any of the above things? How did you overcome such things?</TEXT>

As they seem to say on their front page that its from 3.4% representative. I know not everyone gets the lowest rate, but 15% seems such a lot!  #8203; **Other data I entered:** * Employed full time earning  #163;1,472 a month net income * Not a homeowner and living with parents (actually I did another application as a homeowner and it came out at roughly the same interest rate) *  #163;50 other monthly payments towards other stuff * Also stated that income is not likely to decrease during term of loan * Equifax score is: 449 (accessed via ClearScore) * Experian credit score is: 999 (excellent) * 24 years old  #8203; Is there anyone else in a similar situation?

    <TEXT>Great advice, thanks! Couple of follow up questions/remarks based on that:  #8203; 1) So in regards to the Smart Things hub: the reason I chose this was because it supported both Zigabee and Z-wave devices, to give maximum future compatibility. My question is if I got wi-fi smart home devices (as opposed to Zigabee or Z-Wave), could I still route these through Smart Things, so that all routines could be still be done in one place? 2) Second question: Can Echo/Alexa mirror routines created through Smart Things? Or do I have to program all the routines into Alexa manually?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-18 22:30:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, Picked up the Harmon Kardon HKTS-5 speakers. The centre speaker is quoted as being '25 to 60 watts (I assume RMS) And the subwoofer is quoted as being 60 watts ( I assume RMS) However, the regular satellite speakers are not given any wattage figures. It just says that they recommend a 10- 80 watt AV receiver. Can anyone advise on what the RMS figures for the regular satlitte speakers might be? Here's a link to the product info on the Harmon Kardon website: [HKTS 5 | Compact, 5.1 home theater speaker system with powered subwoofer](https://eu.harmankardon.com/HKTS+5.html)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Link is [https://docdro.id/4Ia6sxw](https://docdro.id/4Ia6sxw) Couple of questions: **1)** With regard to specialist and/or generic skills, do I need to explicitly state these in a bulleted list, similar to how I've listed software skills?. Or can generic/specialist skills be inferred through my uni projects and my work experience or through an introductory summary paragraph? **2)** Does disclosing a disability (in this case High Functioning Autism) put off a potential employer? **3)** Since I don't have that much work experience (only around 4 or 5 months, undertaken during summer breaks), should I be putting more detail into my university experience, and less into my work experience from how it currently is? **4)** I've given a link to my portfolio, is this placed in the correct place for a potential employer to notice it? **5)** Interests: yay or nay?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just not well enough to take on a full-time job. I actually did lots of things during my time off: * Lost around 10kg/26 pounds and as you say bought a Fitbit and got into a good fitness regime * Spent extensive time putting together my urban design portfolio (my degree was in urban design and I'm hoping to go into this as a full time career) * Visited several examples of significant new housing developments (again very relevant to my course of work I'm going in to) * Organised my finances, improving my credit score, opening up a couple of new savings accounts, planning for getting a mortgage in the future * Actively took/am taking CBT sessions to beat my problems Which of these do you think would be most relevant to put down on my CV?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-15 15:58:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>As above. Have OC'd my i7 8700k to 4.5GHz on all six cores. Stress tested on Prime 95 for five to ten minutes and max temperature came out at 85c. For my cooler I have a Noctua NH-U12s  #8203; **So a couple of questions:** 1) Is this a safe temperature? 2)Am I correct in saying that i7s are quite hot to begin with? Because I initially thought that my Noctua cooler was seeming really inefficient at cooling? 3) I am currently running my overclock on stock voltage with no offset? Is this likely to be stable long term. I have an Asus Prime A370-A which is supposed to have good VRM ratings along with a Seasonic 650w Seasonic Plus Gold which is meant to be very high quality. Any opinions much appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lots of question about a potential home server?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-31 23:46:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>1) I'm mostly interested in getting a server for NAS purposes, though would be very open to other uses such as a Plex or as cloud data storage. I currently run 1 PC and 1 laptop, so it would be nice to have automatic backup to the server and seemless synchronisation occur, every time a file is updated on either the PC or laptop. What would be the best software in this case? 2) I currently live with my parents, and so it probably won't be plugged in directly via ethernet to the router downstairs, as would leave too much cable trailing down the stairs. Can I put a wifi card in a server and use that to connect, though I'm well aware its not ideal? The other alternative is to use a wired home plug to connect to it, though due to our awkward wires, I can only get around 45mb on it. What would be the best way forward? 3) Also what IP settings would a home server require me to change on the router?. I've been told my Dad that any experiments that I do must not mess up the internet for others. 4) I have an absolutely ancient PC, which has 3GB DDR 2 RAM and an AMD Athlon 4450e dual core CPU, would this be sufficient to run a server? What's a good target to aim for performance wise? 5) Would a Mini-ITX build be sufficient, as I don't have a lot of space.....  #8203; Please answer with respect as I new to home servers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mainly going to be used for NAS purposes for media streaming and also for backing up data. Not sure of which O/S I'm going to use, but almost certainly Linux or Ubuntu or someone advised using FreeNAS?. *Could I have some advice on this too please?* This is going to use second hand parts in order to keep the cost to an absolute minimum. **As with most sever builds, I will be running this 24/7, so the focus is on making a highly efficient, low power build** **Tentative build**: * PROCESSOR: i5 3570k (would it better to use a processor with a 'S' or 'T' suffix?) * RAM: 16GB DDR3 or DDR4 * GRAPHICS CARD: use iGPU or a very cheap graphics card which doesn't require 6/8 pin power connectors * PSU: reasonable quality (80+ Silver, Gold or Platinum) 350w - 400w PSU * MOTHERBOARD: LGA 1155 ITX board which includes a PCI-E slot * PCI-E Slot: gigabit Ethernet adaptor (10/100/1000) to allow for fast data transfer * SSD: small cheap SSD, probably Sandisk SSD plus to allow for fast O/S bootup * HDD: probably 2 or 3 drives, with total capacity of 4-10TB (haven't worked out exact configuration yet?) Is this overall? Where could I make changes in order to reduce power consumption, with not too with not too much associated performance decrease?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Homeplug/power adaptor question regarding speed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-06 16:04:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>We have Virgin Media 100mb/s internet which comes to a SuperHub v3 router- which does support Gigabit LAN connection- I've checked! I recently bought a pair of TP-Link PA711 AV1000 powerline (gigabit) adaptors, and I used the included cat 5e cables to connect them. Adaptor 1 is connected to the router, though isn't plugged into a direct wall power socket, but into an extension lead. Adaptor 2 is in located in my room and connected to a direct wall power socket. I've run a speed test connecting directly to adaptor 2 via Ethernet, and I'm only getting between 55 and 70mb. **Based on this, my questions are** 1: I suspect that the fact I'm only getting 55 - 70mb vs. the paid for 100mb, might be because adaptor #1 is plugged into an extension lead, rather than a direct outlet, correct? 2: Or might this be a sign that our internal wiring is old? In other words: even if I did find a spare direct wall socket near to the router downstairs, would I be guaranteed to get 100mb/s?  #8203; **Additionally?** 1. Is there a site like Ookla Speedtest that can measure speed of internal network data transfer?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, that's fair enough about extension leads- I don't disagree. What's the best way forward though in my situation where I don't have a free direct power outlet near to the router? And what affect will keeping adaptor 1 plugged into an extension lead have apart from speed reductions? Will there be more latency/jitter or instability? Yeah, I also don't disagree about the time of day and the server you access affecting downward speed. But my point is when on Oookla speedtest, testing the same machine when connected wirelessly to the router downstairs, gave 100mb, compared to only 55-70mb when going via the said pair of Homeplugs.</TEXT>

I had no idea that 40-50% of potential power line bandwidth capacity is considered typical In regards to the power socket situation: both the router itself and the powerline adaptor are both on extension leads, as we have a distinct lack of wall outlets in our house Speed from direct ethernet connection from router \[its a combined modem and router\] to computer is bang on 100 megabytes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, Downstairs we have a Virgin Media Superhub 3, which is connected via a pair of homeplugs, to a TL-Link wifi Router. The TP-Link has been converted to act as a range extender (been given the same SSID as the SuperHub 3, been given a unique IP address and had DHCP turned off for it). My question is this: if I plug a gigabit Ethernet network switch into one of the TP Links LAN ports, will there be any determinantal performance impact on devices plugged into this network switch vs plugging in directly to the TP Link router? More importantly are there any potential technical issues, as you are now three levels deep, so this got me wondering</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-18 11:12:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, got a bit of issue regarding a new gigabit switch (Netgear GS608 V3) **To begin by giving a bit of context:** * Our internet comes via cable, and comes into a Virgin Superhub 3 Router * A pair of 1200 mega bit homeplugs connects the SuperHub 3 via our internal powerline network to another router (a TP-LINK WDR3600), which is set up in my room to act as an AP * The TP-LINK WDR3600 has been assigned the same SSID as the SuperHub 3, and has had DHCP and UNPNP turned off, as per a guide I found online. The TP-Link WDR3600 has also been assigned a unique IP address, different from the SuperHub 3 **Now here is the root of the problem:** * In my room I am connecting nearly all of my devises via Ethernet to WDR3600 router. Because there are only 4 Ethernet ports on the WD3600 router, I bought a gigabit switch to give me additional Ethernet ports. All devices connected to the WDR3600 router, work absolutely fine in regard to local and internet network access * However, whilst my newly acwuired gigabit switch powers on fine, none of the network activity lights light up, even when there is device plugged in to any of the Ethernet ports. * Also on the WDR3600 router, the network activity light for the ethernet port which the ethernet cable from the gigabit switch is connected to, doesn't light up either</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys **Setup is below:** 2 x Phillips Lighstrip Pluses (and associated Phillips Hue Bridge) 1 x Samsung Smart Things Hub v2 1x Logitech Harmony Hub (w/ Logitech Elite controller) **And my home entertainment setup:** 1x Samsung UE40MU6120 TV 1x Pioneer VSX 531 AV Receiver (which my PS4 and 4k blu ray player are routed through) Basically my question is with the above setup is there anyway I can get my TV to sync with the Phillips Lighstrip pluses, via the Phillips Hue Sync mechanism? **Please also bear in mind:** I am using the Smart Things Classic app to control these, as I have an iPad 2 as the main home controller. And this is the only version of the Smart Things app it will support. If you need any more clarifcation on anything then please ask!

    <TITLE>Samsung Smart Things Hub v2  amp; Phillips Hue Bridge- do these need to be connected to one of the Ethernet ports directly on the router?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 14:28:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Do the ST Hub v2 and Hue Bridge have to be connected directly to one of the ethernet ports on the router? Would my observation be correct, that the Phillips Hue Bridge doesn't get recognised by the app when connected into at attached additional Ethernet switch (N.B: its only a 10/100 one, NOT gigabit- I don't know whether this makes a difference?) and so needs to be connected directly to of the Ethernet ports on the router? I haven't tried the Samsung Smart Things v2 hub yet? So can someone advise on this please?? Difficulty is we have so many other devices which will only work when plugged in to one of the Ethernet ports directly on the router (a Hive hub and a couple of homeplugs) Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Smart Things Classic App on an old iPad 2</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 20:43:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have an old iPad 2 which I am using for smart home purposes. I have a Samsung Smart Things Hub v2 to control everything. However, the problem it won't support higher than iOS 9.3.5 (or something), meaning I am stuck with the Smart Things Classic App, because it requires deviceis its installed on to have iOS 10 or higher. So based on this I have a couple of questions: 1) Is Samsung Smart Things Classic app really that bad? What can't it do that the new Smart Things app can't? 2) Is there a possible workaround? Like is there a Smart Things web interface that I could have a link to on my iPad? Or maybe I could use something like the smart tiles web interface? Thanks in advance! If you need any more clarification on anything then please feel free to ask</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Router its connected to:** TP Link WDR-3600 It was working fine yesterday. Now suddenly two of the three lights have gone off and its therefore not syncing with the iPhone app. The power light remains on. I've tried a different Ethernet socket on the router, and powering the router and the bridge on and off again, as well as a different ethernet cable. The weird thing is I also have a SmartThings Hub v2, which is also connected to the same router, and this works fine. Any ideas? Has the bridge simply packed up do you think?</TEXT>

Taking the Ethernet cable out and then pushing it a bit more softly till it clicked solved the problem, as all three lights now show up.

    <TEXT>Not having much sleep means your reaction time is slow, your decision making faculities are very impaired and you are just generally very foggy? This owing to ongoing problems with sleep. I'm having CBT and doing all I can to help myself. However, I'm currently applying for jobs, and so you need to be pretty sharp to write ace CVs and own job interviews. Currently its very difficult to do this. What's the best way to deal with the mind fogginess? I did think just allowing yourself double, tripple or maybe even quadruple the time to think and make decisions vs. the time it would normally take when you are awake?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2nd Masters Degree in Urban Design/Job advice in the UK?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 20:20:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Don't know how many people there in the UK here, but would appreciate some advice please! If you are not in the UK, then feel free to ignore this I completed an 4 year integrated masters City  amp; Regional course at Oxford Brookes, graduating May 2018. My specialisms in my masters year were i) regeneration and ii) global development and urbanisation; and my masters dissertation focused on a regeneration topic. **ALSO**: I did do three urban design modules as part of the undergrad portion of my degree I had a year or so off after this due to health issues, and formally began applying for planning jobs in Sep 2019; since then I've had a few interviews, but as of June 2020 I still don't have a job. I've applied for a wide range of stuff from short term local authority contracts to technical officer roles to junior roles in consultancy- it seems to be a very difficult market to break into! So its been a while since I've done anything significant career wise. Because of this we wondered whether it might be an idea just to do another masters course, in order to stay competitive because there is a rather large and growing gap of not much happening since my graduation. Also because I've decided that I'd like to go into much more of a design-based role. So I'm considering doing a MA course in Urban Design.  #8203; **I've whittled it down to two possible universities (these are my two nearest unis which do urban design masters courses accredited by RTPI) \[ i'm also lucky enough to not have to self-finance this\]:** Go back to do 1 year MA (or 8 month PG Diploma) in Urban Design at Oxford Brookes * Very awkward 1 1/2 hour commute from home on a coach that only runs every 2 hours, to lectures which take place 2 days a week * But I do get a 10% alumni discount 1 year MA (no PG diploma option) in Urban Design and Planning at London South Bank * 30 minute commute on trains which run every 5 or 10 minutes * The campus looks dated, and the course doesn't look as strong as Brookes ( OK maybe I'm biased)  #8203; What do you think would be the best way forward, to give myself the best chance of starting my career well?  #8203; 1) Do I do the MA course in order to give proof of recent work and engagement, and bridge the gap between my past graduation and now? Would this make me significantly more employable, and could a PG Diploma give just as much necessary urban design experience, without having to commit as much time as an MA? 2) Might I just need to write a better CV; is the gap between me graduating and beginning to look for jobs still OK from an employers perspective, providing you basically have the right skills and motivation? 3) Any other more creative ideas? I'm all ears!  #8203; Many thanks in advance!  #8203; *DISCLAMER: during the period between graduating and now, I haven't literally done nothing* *I have: i) put together an online design portfolio ii) visited examples of current/past development projects iii) lost quite a bit of weight iv) done some wider reading on subjects not covered in degree- I do mention these on my CV!*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In more detail: * There is significantly less taboo over 18 rated films in the UK vs. NC-17 rated movies in the US- why do you think this is, and what cultural factors have had an influence? I've read that quite a lot of formerly rated NC-17 rated movies have been cut to be suitable for an R rating. * I guess I'm right in saying that NC-17 ratings are given to films which are exceptionally extremely violent/sexual? (with the boundaries for what would class as NC-17 (vs R) being set much higher than the UK '18' ratings?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just bought a subscription to an All Apps Creative Cloud package, and am keen to master these programs, since I have a lot of free time due to the impact of COVID-19. **In the past 48 hours or so I've alternated between three courses:** * Completed a 3 hour free 'Photoshop for Beginners' tutorial on YouTube from Dan Scott * Am 23 minutes into a 15 hour Premier Pro Essentials Training Course on Skill Share (also a Dan Scott video) * And have completed 80% of a 5h 40m course on inDesign on SkillShare- entitled 'Adobe inDesign- Essentials Training Course (Another Dan Scott video) 1) Is this level of cramming a good way of saturating your mind with knowledge. Are you likely to remember more this way? I'm a bit worried that I'm going to forget a lot of what I've learnt within a month or two? 2) Is my method of alternating between different courses also a good way to learn.

    <TEXT>What's are the main differences between these two versions of the Hue lighstrip plus? I'm particularly interested in knowing whether the outdoor version of the lighstrip might be more strongly shielded, and therefore be more resistant to bending of it to fit a particular space? I've sadly just had to ditch an indoor Lightstrip because certain sections stopped lighting up properly due to needing to bend and re-bend it to fit a certain space properly UPDATE: if the outdoor version of the lighstrip is indeed more resistant, I would be planning on using it indoors</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When people say things like 'all sexual orientations are equal' and 'it doesn't matter who you love', and 'marriage has nothing to do with kids', or 'the rightness of a a relationship should be judged based on the commitment, not on biology', then can one consistently reject incest or polygamy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-15 14:11:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm happy and willing to follow the evidence where it leads on this. And if, homophobia is being defined as irrational dislike, prejudice and mistrust of people that openly experience unchosen attraction to the same-sex, then I'm open acknowledging that this has historically been a thing within some demographics sections of the population, and still is present to varying extents in non-western countries too. Nor am I saying that the forms of relationship below are full moral equivalents either to one another, or to life-long faithful, exclusive and committed same-sex romantic/sexual relationships But I still can't help thinking that if one is being 100% consistent with the four arguments above, which are often used by proponents for same-sex marriage, it is quite difficult logically speaking to simultaneously affirm loving, and exclusive faithful homosexual romantic/sexual relationships, whilst also condemning say: * A faithful, loving, exclusive and committed sexual/romantic relationship between an adult-aged brother and sister, who decide they never want to have kids, and both decide to be sterilised, * A faithful, loving, exclusive and committed sexual/romantic relationship between two adult-aged cousins, who decide they never want to have kids, and both decide to be sterilised, * A faithful, loving, exclusive and committed sexual/romantic relationship between two adult-aged step-siblings, who decide they never want to have kids, and both decide to be sterilised, * A faithful, loving, and committed sexual/romantic relationship between a Muslim or Mormon man and several wives. He gives the exact same money and share of the house share to each wife, and treats them all with the exact same love and affection. Also, if we're opening up marriage to 'all sectors of the population', then why shouldn't we open it to religious minorities I'm genuinely yet to hear any proponent of same-sex marriage give the logical and consistent principle on which they affirm same-sex loving, exclusive and faithful and committed sexual/romantic relationship, whilst also condemning the above types of relationship mentioned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Huge A amp;B fan here (I'm 25), and yes I too can confirm that listeners and producers of trance/progressive music is \[sadly\] vastly underrepresented by my age group. People my age frustratingly don't seem to 'get it'. I mean I do genuinely enjoy techno and house, albeit a bit more casually, and particularly the more atmospheric and melodic end (Eric Prydz, Guy J, Way out West, Global Underground, Anjunadeep), but to me, it does seem as if in London and the South, the dance music scene is very over represented by house and techno nights (not that there's anything objectively bad about these genres) vs other genres such as trance, liquid dnb, hard dance or breaks. I went to university in Oxford (not the real one), and there was a weekly techno/house/garage night called Switch. In comparison in the four years I studied, there, I counted one trance night. The EDM Society at Brookes as far as I was aware, was almost entirely driven by house and techno. I used to speak to someone on the Anjunabeats forum who was at Exeter University, and the executive board of the EDM Society there, said they wouldn't let people play unless they played techno or house.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We went to it too! I remember it like it was yesterday. Yeah I remember the dark alley as well with the animatronic spider. The girls in our class shrieked with terror. Also another funny moment related to the train track scenario. Our group leader asked us 'so what do you think is wrong here?'- (the obvious and immediate answer being that the pretend person was unlawfully straying on the tracks') My friend replied 'the livery of that locomotive is of out of date, Network South East haven't existed for a decade' He was immediately sent home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What's your favourite F amp;F film out of interest? For me personally: I really like the first one, didn't like the second, have grown to like the third and got really bored from the 4th. Haven't seen any of the others.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about blu-ray audio formats?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 18:00:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've just started seriously collecting blu-rays these past couple of weeks, and have noticed that older blu-rays tend to feature: **Linear PCM \[LPCM\] 5.1 or 7.1,** as opposed to True HD/DTS-HD MA or Atmos/DTS-X So my question is: Does a LPCM 5.1/7.1 soundtrack give similar quality/bit rate to True HD/DTS-HD MA?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah right. Do you think the difference between 16bit and 24 bit is all that noticeable? Also Wikipedia seems to say that True HD is up to 18 Mbit/s and DTS-HD MA is up to 24.5 Mbits, how would LPCM compare to these two formats?+</TEXT>
