    <TEXT>I just found the game again and I noticed that I #8217;ve only played it for roughly 5 hours. I wanna start fresh, but I #8217;m not sure what classes are the best in this game in order to clear the game in one run (is there even a NG+?). So what are your top picks? And why did you choose them? :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This takes me back to when I first explored this city and got into the forest. I always found the atmosphere so wonderful and fitting to the dark theme of the whole game. It's just so mysterious and I think that this is something that Professor Layton OSTs have always done right - creating just the right atmosphere in the perfect moments. I love it so so much and I really wish for there to be more content soon. I bought all the re-releases for mobile and I would honestly love an hd or complete remake, trilogy or honestly, anything, for the Switch! I've finished Katrielle's adventure multiple times already haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! Just bumping in - I'm currently working on a new team (and thank God I have the DLC because I really don't have the time to grind these days...) and I'm not sure what to choose, Healing-only Botanist or Shaman. I'm currently on the 4th labyrinth and I'm noticing that my Botanist barely gets to heal because my party is kinda strong anyway, so that unit is getting redundant. Tbh the only reason I'm not 100% set on the Shaman is the fact that they can't revive units while the Botanist can. Any thoughts on that? Are there any other ways to revive units without a Botanist (and items)? Does it maybe pay off to just use items instead? I think I'll go for a Fencer / Pugilist / Necro / ?? / ?? setup.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ich pers #246;nlich find, dass alles au #223;er gr #252;n 'bitte daheim bleiben, wenn's geht' hei #223;t. Es ist echt schade, dass Leute sich nicht einmal damit zufrieden geben, nur manchmal 1-2 Leute zu treffen statt mehrmals in Gro #223;gruppen zu sein. Ich will kein Spa #223;verderber sein, aber irgendwie ist's echt lahm, dass viele das nicht durchziehen und andere Menschen damit indirekt in Gefahr bringen. Selbst, wenn man ein 'gesunder' Mensch ist, kann's einen hart treffen. Ich hab zB. viele Allergien und hatte starken Schnupfen, Husten, etc  #252;ber die ganze Kindheit. Dadurch habe ich echt Angst davor, weil ich wei #223;, wie unangenehm es ist, krank zu sein.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t know that the Brouni has that Union skill! Might swap my Botanist for a Shaman after all! Thank you! And I have to be honest, I #8217;m just trying out new classes here. I #8217;m not too sure about how chains work and who else I should put into my team for that... if I use a Shaman, I still have a free spot. Masuaro maybe?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fastest way to unlock the Vampire class /skills?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 11:43:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve never gotten far in this one, so now that I finally have the time, I #8217;m restarting the adventure! I #8217;m curious about the Vampire in this game and I #8217;d like to use it as quickly as possible. According to the wiki, there are 3 methods. 1. StreetPass someone with a Vampire Guild Card -not a chance 2. A vampire card in the guild card library -is there a way to get this in the game? 3. Abyssal Shrine. (post game?) And 3+1 humane requirements: -have at least one of every class registered in your guild. (this means just creating 1 character per class and never using them right?) -have at least 100 guild cards registered. (is there a way to do that ingame?) -have at least 100 hours of playtime on your current save file. (that one is easy) -In addition to three of the above, recruit and use a Guest Character in battle successfully. (how do I get guest characters?) A lot of this seems to be about guild cards and all I know is that you CAN get some ingame, but I only recall getting one or two in EOV from NPCs. Is there a different way to get this? And how do I unlock the quest? Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so I should 1. scan 100 guid cards (one of them with a vampire) 2. restart the game and play on Heroic (at least in the beginning) 3. create all classes 4. scan a guid card and recruit a character from them. That works the same as 1. right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you haha! Can #8217;t wait to properly try it out. All I #8217;m doing rn is using the portrait for my Sovereign since I think that it fits there the most.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This week, Etrian Odyssey V arrived and I #8217;ve finally picked up the series again! I love it so so much and I enjoy my more experimental playthroughs of the game! Other than that, I got a sealed Fire Emblem Echoes for cheap (I also love FE sm!!) and Virtues Last Reward for under 40 bucks. I #8217;m very happy that I found all these games for reasonable prices and that I still have the chance to complete my collection.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on my semi-basic team? Trying to deal lots of damage with all classes + Sovereign and a Healer who can attack</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:37:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would kindly ask for you to help me out with my team! Basically, I've played EO1, 4, 5 and Untold. I usually play Easy and Normal. I'm currently playing Nexus and I'm trying out a new team on Heroic, so I don't just play with the same tactics. I just haven't figured out how to use the new classes yet, so I would like to ask you for some advice! I've written down all my current thoughts on my units, so please feel free to judge, correct and help me with anything. Thank you so much! I'm also aware that some of my thoughts might be completely wrong, so please be gentle with me. I'm very new to trying out different skills. My setup isn't the most unique ever, but for my standards, it's definitely more versatile than I used to play. I'm before the Wyvern fight (Jungle labyrinth) and I'm using the DLC in order to time-efficiently be able to try out new classes AND to be over-leveled for now, as I'm just not the best at tactics yet. Hero / Imperial / Sovereign Gunner / War Mage  #8203; I'm open to any suggestions for possible class swaps! My current setup is probably not that great, so please share anything with me that you have in mind! I would just like to keep the Imperial and Sovereign, if possible.  #8203; **Hero:** I don't know what to focus on. All master skills seem kind of useless to me? Is this class' Force Boost that great? (Retain Force, Force Gift) I mean yes, if I focus on dealing high damage and it's also a good passive healing ability. Other than that, I've tried out the Afterimage skill a bit in battle. It seems pretty alright, but I can't seem to deal high damage with my Hero anyways. It's way less than my Imperial's. I just don't know what Attack skills to focus on, so I haven't leveled them a lot. And I think I will completely ignore the defence skills because I have my Sovereign and War Mage for that. Healing + defence buff. **Imperial:** I really like this class because of Accel Drive. I just don't know what to do while the blade is cooling down. Heat sink seems like a wasted turn to me because it doesn't deal any damage - are there any other attacks that are worth focusing on while the blade is cooling down? Also, the TP!! Is there any other way to save up TP in a clever way? I don't want to solely rely on the Break skill. **Sovereign:** My first time playing with this class. I usually start off with the Attack buff and then I just randomly buff defence or protect. Because my Sovereign is in the first row and my main damage dealers are also in the first row, I feel like I'm wasting the Attack buff a little since my Sovereign doesn't usually attack... but there is also skills that only work when the Sovereign is buffed. I just haven't figured out how Final Decree and Renew are supposed to be used. He needs 3 buffs for that, but what to use? **Gunner:** I'm thinking of replacing this class honestly. All I'm doing with it is using Charged Shot, but my unit keeps dying. Using the defence buff on the second row just for the Gunner and Medic seems like a waste to me also because I could buff the first row instead (as they usually get more damage). At the same time, my Sovereign slightly heals rows with every buff. So I'm not too sure about that. **War Mage:** I started off with a Medic, but I instead wanted a class that can heal, revive AND attack. But to me leg binding, etc seems to useless. And that's basically all this class can attack. Most times it misses, so in the end my current Healer (War Mage) is not really doing much other than healing and reviving... And then they end up getting bound or an ailment instead and can't use any healing spells anymore. I also heard that there are sub-classes in the game? How do I unlock them and what would make sense here? Considering how much my Sovereign heals, I might as well assign the War Mage class to him instead or give my War Mage the medic sub class just for removing binds, ailments and more accurate and cheaper revive. Even though I have that maxed out in the War Mage class and it worked both times so far...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Get them, you won't regret it. The games might *seem* like it's a basic mystery story with lots of random minigame-like puzzles to solve, but it's actually so much more. But but but!!! The story. All of the 6 main games connect and if you play them in the order that they were released in, that's totally alright and coherent. The chronological timeline is also alright. It just makes sense to play Azran last or you'll be spoiled to oblivion. The story has so many twists and the protagonists are very lovable, intelligent and sophisticated, so it's just a great time all around. You'll learn to love them so so quickly. Now, the puzzles. I played my first Layton game at the age of 10 and I must have spent multiple hundreds of hours on it because I would partly try out all possible solutions until it worked haha. So it's really not child's play. It's a rather dark series and a lot of the puzzles are story-relevant and the time when they're presented makes sense. I would even go as far as to say that the Layton series majorly impacted my language development (I would even watch let's plays in other languages of it just to learn more sophisticated sentences) and also my love for solving puzzles, even though I'm by far not the best at it still. Atmosphere. While Layton excels at literally all aspects of a challenging and wonderful game series, there's one thing that keeps bringing me back to it. The art is beautiful - the backgrounds feel so real, but also surreal at times... it just fits so well and especially the colors are so great to help with the atmosphere. Obviously, the music helps a lot too in this department. There are countless tracks that are memorable and I still listen to the OST regularly to this day. It's beautiful, tense - just right. Also, the characters might seem over the top at times, especially minor ones. But honestly? The fact that they don't look like the most realistic humans makes a lot of them so memorable. Professor Layton really is a series that will capture you, no matter of your age. You will love it, so please give it a try! I'm a big fan, so I really love telling others about the series. If you have any questions, as simple as they may be - please ask me!! I'm always here to talk about what shaped my childhood and who I am today so much. I also really recommend the movie (Eternal Diva)! It connects to the games as well (just not gravely) and I have the DVD and Blue-Ray of it because it's just a masterpiece. The story, the music, the characters. It's so amazing!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's just... sad. My wishful thinking at this point would be for Nintendo to buy Level-5 and help them out. When the DS came out, Professor Layton was everywhere. I remember that every demo DS in stores had either Layton or Mario 64 DS on it. Although the series is technically finished, I feel like the mother company behind the game contributed quite a lot to the DS and Nintendo. Miracle Mask even is the only reason why I ended up saving for months as a kid just to buy myself a 3DS. I think what went wrong is the fact that Katrielle should have started off with WAY more support of Layton, Luke and other popular characters. I used to be reluctant to get the games at release because I simply didn't like the fact that Layton pretty much isn't in it. I now own the 3DS and Switch versions of the game and I think with Katrielle, they must have lost quite a lot of their audience because instead of strictly following a complex story, it feels more like the game is separated into completely unrelated mysteries. What I also missed is how mature the Layton games are in comparison. There was no real enemy until the last mystery and even that wasn't tense... like at all. I don't think trying to be more child-friendly did the series any good. I also watched the anime and I just don't understand why they completely left out Layton in the game when he's in the anime. The game would have profited A LOT more by giving Layton and Luke some screentime in the beginning, middle and in the end instead of creating two different endings.</TEXT>
