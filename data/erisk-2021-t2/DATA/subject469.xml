    <DATE>2019-03-17 00:01:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Many newbies come here asking very basic questions hoping to get quick answers. Yet, often there aren #8217;t many Breaditers replying such. I understand the feelings as I started baking bread seriously at around last Christmas and I had a ton of ?????? in my head. Instead, I read what #8217;s posted currently and keyed in what #8217;s not mentioned (but bugging my mind.) For example, I keyed in *dough whisk* as I was wondering,  #8220;Do I need a dough whisk? #8221; Vola, a *5y old post* popped up and it saved me some #128176;. That little money went to more ingredients for bread. #128522; From not able to get an ear nor scoring properly to successfully growing my own starter for sourdough, I have Breadit to thank for my little bread making success as a hobbyist. Please don #8217;t be discouraged if you don #8217;t get many replies or  #128077;votes for your not-so-good looking loaf. Nor should you be jealous of those who can produce a gorgeous loaf on their first few tries. We are not in a competition and we all get there eventually. Time is our best friend in bread-making. Lastly, not a loaf is wasted, as even if you get a hard brick, it could be turned into a tray of yummy and utterly soft bread and butter pudding or some French toasts for breakfast. *Just me thinking out load*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Shopping trip experience</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-21 20:59:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>A dear old friend came from overseas to visit me and I took her out shopping yesterday. It was a whole day of shop-till-you-drop kind of trip as things are a lot more expensive at where she lives. I was her chaperon and a willing servant, looking after her belongings and carrying her loot and whatnots so she could shop in peace. She must feel awful thus kept asking me if I wanted anything. To a point that she wanted to grab some sweets for me at a counter of one store so that I could have a break. She knew I am a minimalist and shop only when necessary and I was out a whole day just accompanying her to satisfy her fantasy. I told her, honestly, what I enjoyed was having her around after 3 years apart and everything else didn #8217;t matter. And I was not least influenced by her nonstop buying clothes and stuff. *When one is at peace with the material world, one looks beyond #STUFF.* We don #8217;t impose our lifestyle upon others as we don #8217;t want them to do it to us either. Thought I #8217;d share this with people here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Methods to store sliced bread in the fridge? Please read on -</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-02 21:33:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>As we live in a tropical country, we don #8217;t store bread in the room temperature (coolest is about 80F early morning then it goes up too high n humidity is often 90+ plus) or else it gets mouldy fast. I defrosted and sliced a loaf yesterday and left the whole thing in a double ziplock bag in the fridge. My son got hungry at night and ate some. Then he didn #8217;t seal the double ziplock bag properly. The bread turned stale this morning. It didn #8217;t taste as good even toasted. Is there a way to revive the bread? And what other good methods to keep sliced bread fresh in the fridge? Tks in advance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live next to 4 decent shopping malls. The nearest one is next door, 2 min walk and I am there. The other 3 are next to this one. Crazy, I know. One of my 2 big oblong serving plates chipped last night as I was just clumsy. I walked over to the mall to buy a replacement after dinner and cleaned up my place. There was a huge sale on all white fine bone porcelain dinnerware, with many marked down to 90% off. I had a look at each item carefully. Then I grabbed the exact same one I broke, paid for it and walked home. I didn #8217;t feel bad about not grabbing more of the beautiful plates as I just needed one. I was happy the one I needed was 20% off. Sales come and go but I don #8217;t need to grab every opportunity. *Who is doing all the dishes anyway?*</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-15 21:42:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am one believing using things till they are broken. And if can be fixed, do it instead of replacing. But...... You all will laugh at what I am going to say as I just behaved like a hypocrite. It #8217;s just about some heat resistant nylon? tongs for flipping or picking up food from the hot cookware. It #8217;s an inexpensive pair from Tescoma UK that has been (discontinued?) as no longer on its site. I reckoned it #8217;s highly possible due to the poor design. They ate the most difficult thing to wash in my kitchen for years!!!! I cursed every single time I washed them literally. They are easy to use but a pain in the A to make clean. The clipping tips had groves that always made food stuck in between. I would use all sorts of brushes, including a toothbrush to clean yucky food residual for many minutes. They are not possible to be cleaned in a dish washer as claimed. I tolerated ruining my hands over the years. Finally, I was so fed up that I wrapped them up and left the package at our building recycling centre with a note - *Really good tongs to use, but super bad tongs to wash. Free to a good home.* Then I walked next door to buy the stainless steel tongs that I had been eyeing on for more than an year even though they only had 10% discount. I am no proud of myself for getting rid of something not broken. But they didn #8217;t bring any joy but hatred and resentment in my life. I got rid of the tongs and tried my new stainless steel ones. So easy to wash the new toys. *Told myself that I saved water, dish washing liquid, time and most of all, sanity. Worth it? Oh, a definitely YES!* Edited: it #8217;s an *inexpensive* one from Tescoma UK and tongS (bad grammar)  #128517;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I said above. I live next to 4 malls and one is practically of within 2 minutes walking distance. Seeing fast fashion is a daily affair but it doesn #8217;t affect me. I had to buy new clothes as quite a few of them were worn and not very presentable when I went out, especially when meeting with the professionals. Even my son started complaining how I looked sometimes. Being fussy and having the fixated idea of - if not perfect, don #8217;t buy - had put me off from replacing even once piece for the longest time. All of the sudden I saw 2 items that may be the right things and tried them on. And yes, I bought them on the spot. Came home, sorted out 10 pieces to be donated at Uniqlo (which accepts all preloved items regardless brands for repurposing.) 10 old items for 2 new ones and I feel great.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fire range vs Induction for cast iron cookware</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-31 06:20:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been contemplating about changing from fire range to an induction one for the longest time as I live in a high rise and think an induction version could be safer? (Yes/No?) However, I am not sure I will like it better as I have only used fire range all my life. Questions for those who use induction stovetops: 1. Does the surface get scratched by cast iron easily? (I only have raw Lodge and 1 no name brand) 2. Is it fast to change from high temp to low and vice versa, especially for wok cooking? 3. Does it cool down fast enough for cleaning? 4. True energy saving as I read? Thanks for advice.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-02 23:29:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure if this is *minimalism* related. Please remove it by all means. I have congenital trigger fingers on many digits of both hands. Had a couple of operations in the past and have no major issues with most things in life. My hands function ok and I have pretty decent penmanship due to tough practice even though I can not hold a pen like a normal person does. Then problem arose as I age. Now nearly half a century old, I found myself not able to hold a cup *WITH* a handle, especially when I made my espresso in the morning as those handles were so tiny. *And I have small hands too!* Solution? I found my 2 small IKEA 365 angled side *bowls* were the perfect size for that as no handles to cause spillage. Been using these small bowls as espresso cups for months now and I can #8217;t be happier. No more coffee stains on the table and no curious looks from visitors. I passed my 3 espresso cups with handles to a friend who expressed her liking towards them. It #8217;s time like this made me think how difficult it #8217;s for the handicapped. And I thank God that my problem was only minor. Just want to share this small joyous thing in life. These are [the bowls](https://www.amazon.com/IKEA-Bowl-angled-sides-white/dp/B07KLTH5DL/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?keywords=IKEA+angled+side+bowl amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1559517910 amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=gateway amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=8-5).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help! My starting is acting up!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-03 09:22:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Up till my last bread few days ago? The starter was so alive and bubbly. Then I fed it again and it doubled up but became rather thin. I thought nothing of it and proceeded with the dough. After 30min, I was about to pull n fold yet it couldn #8217;t be pulled but was just very watery n pasty as there was no gluten in the dough! I checked my starter. It had no awful smell, it was super *frosty* and *foaming* like when I was making it at the beginning. I decided to discard 150g and fed it 50g rye and water as how I made the starter back in March. It #8217;s on the countertop now. I read the recipe and it said the double should happen from 4 - 24 hrs. Did I do it right or should I chuck the entire bottle and grow another batch of starter? I read it #8217;s hard to kill starter and honestly don #8217;t know what happened. The only reason I could think of is I had changed from fridge feeding n growing to countertop (to save time). I live in a hot and humid country n the temp change from fridge 4C to outside 27-30C in and out may be an issue? Overly bubbly? Did i do it right to save my starter? Any suggestions? Tqvm *Disheartened*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cucumbers were banned in my house, literally. That was till 2 years ago when I introduced Japanese cucumbers and the family accepted the dish on the first try! I mixed Japanese cucumbers in the yoghurt and some spices as raita, a dish they avoided when dining in an Indian restaurant. I then realised my family has a hate towards the bigger cucumber species only. I still can #8217;t incorporate those into any dishes. Takes time I suppose. The dish in pic - Typical east meets west in my house: crispy skin ocean trout with crispy sage, roasted mixed potatoes, steamed greens of broccoli, okra, and Japanese cucumbers mixed in a spicy sauce The cucumbers were steamed the last n only in it for 1 min or so to briefly heat up. Maintained the crunchiness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wash the rice till water runs clear, robbing rice grains many times when washing. Different types of rice require different amount of water but generally 1 cup Of rice to slightly more than 1 cup of water for Thai Jasmine rice. More for Basmati and brown n less for Japanese short grain n etc. The rice n water goes into a container to be fitted into the IP inner pot. I use *rice setting* but *steaming method* - In the inner pot - Water, trivet, container w rice n water *Coz I only cook about 1 to 1  amp; 1/2 cup of rice each time (not consuming much.)* If cooking more than 2 cups of rice, I will cook it inside the inner pot without the extra water nor trivet. So 2 cup rice to slightly more than 2 cups water in the inner pot. Do rice setting, if having time, delay cooking for 10-15min so rice gets soaked. Cook the rice. Do NOT open the lid even if the pin drops off before 10 min! This is so important as the rice will continue to cook w the residual heat. Open the lid at least after 10-15min of cooking #8217;s done. I prefer 15 min. You can now fluff the rice and enjoy separated grains and spongy rice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use it to leaven starter and sourdough when the room temp is not ideal n IP has timer so it #8217;s easier to follow too Add water in the inner pot, about 1 cup Add trivet In another small 1qt glass bowl, add starter n feed it Put the bowl on the trivet Turn the IP power on. Press Yoghurt and start. Put the lid on but leaving a little gap for air to go in so the starter can breathe. My IP is manufactured to 8 hours and starts to count down from there Yoghurt setting is consistently 24-27C which is the ideal environment for yeast to grow My starter usually mature in about 2 hours, give and take Then I measure the starter I need and ingredients for my sourdough in another bigger glass bowl that can #8217;t fit into IP but will sit nicely on it, cover it loosely with my IKEA glass over that has a hole so the dough can breath. (This can be done with a tea towel.) Again, please make sure there is enough water in the bottom of inner pot or the IP may be burnt after turned on for hours Reset the yoghurt setting and press start. The timer on IP is good for checking when to stretch and fold. And when the dough is ready in about 3 hours, I do the bench rest, shaping and whatnots I use the big glass bowl to sit over the IP as I don #8217;t want the dough to be overproofed. A metal bowl may conduct heat too fast. Glass and ceramic are more ideal imo The constant warm temp and the timer on the pot makes sourdough making a lot easier especially I am often multitasking HTH</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not being lazy or running out of scoring ideas. I simply decided that I ought to get all the basics properly done before heading for more. So....... KAF method to the very fine point. Unfortunately, the dough only had 9.5hrs time in the fridge. (Would have waited for 12 hours for more even crumbs but we needed bread for breakfast.) Dusted only wee bit of flour on the bare basket and scored just one cut. 35 min later, an old fashion, uncomplicated loaf was born. Breakfast - homemade extra thin bacon, sourdough with cod fish liver pate, Lebanese eggplants with Italian parsley, sweet basil, garlic and Parmesan, and a half boiled egg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Southeast Asia and I found most *famous* recipes didn #8217;t work till I tried KAF No Knead SD and it has been a point of no return. But I cannot do autolyse (always overproofed), just add all ingredients in one go, 3 up to 4hrs bulk (including final resting time) the most, and it goes into fridge immediately. And can be ready from 5hrs onward but best crumbs usually comes between 12 a 19 hrs cold retardation. NO further bench rest but baked from cold fridge to hot oven immediately. It #8217;s like chasing time. Hydration wise, it hasn #8217;t been such a big issue for me. I can go from about 75-85% without difficultly. Only lower is easier to score and Higher being stickier. I do prefer higher as the bread is fluffier. Work fast in our condition is the key. Having said all the above, I think your loaf looks way awesome hence probably don #8217;t want to change anything you are doing as it must be right for you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recipe (a rough guide) - Egg noodles buy or make - 300G plain flour 150g or less eggs (measure without shell) Pinch of salt About 1t cooking oil Knead dough till smooth. It shouldn #8217;t be too soft. A bit dry is always better than wet. Rest dough for an hr. Cut it into desired width and thickness. Boil the noodles just before serving as it will cook very fast. Once the noodles r cooked, add it into a bowl that already has the shiitake mushrooms sauce, some extra soy sauce and mix. Chop lost fresh shiitake coarsely (dry ones must be soaked till soft if u prefer them), and garlic. (I user a food processor.) add these to Instant pot, add soy sauce, and some oyster sauce, white pepper powder at least 1 cup of cooking oil or mushrooms must be immersed in oil. Add a pork bone if not vegetarian. Stew for 30 min. I often make a lot n store it in the fridge as it is a handy sauce for noodles and rice. Parcook or steam hard vegetables and set aside. Heat the pan till hot. Crumble some fermented dry fish in oil (buy this in a Chinese grocer) and add it into the DRY n HOT pan. Mash the fish flash and let it dry up. Then add little bit of cooking oil, sliced garlic, thinly sliced pork and fry all till pork is cooked and slightly browned. Add in raw vegetables, then parcooked vegetables. Season the salmon with rock salt, coarsely ground si chuan red peppercorn, some hot paprika (Or cayenne chilli pepper powder). Set this aside for 15 min. Heat pan till hot, add cooking oil, add in salmon. Turn heat to low. Fry for about 3 min then turn to the other side for another 3 min or so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have baked a year worth of bread, especially sourdough, which is pretty much the only kind of bread I bake and eat nowaways. I didn #8217;t know what was a *starter*, let alone cultivating my own *Steroids* from ground zero. Then I improved my tight crumbs to light and airy ones, then I wanted to get ONE of those EARS so badly, followed by the big bubbly blistery exterior, the different mixes of flours and ingredients, the beautifully designed scorings, shaping without flour added... I had done it all. This year my goal is pasta and noodles quest, especially handmade pasta shapes. I thought it was going to be easier than baking a loaf of sourdough. Hmm, I had proven myself very wrong as of now. We will see how things turn out in 2021. Yes, I am continuing to bake sourdough and feeding my *Steroids* religiously. I no longer buy bread unless emergencies, though I probably should still bake my most popular commercial yeast sandwich loaves once in a while. But, but, but, my current sourdough quest is a single score of laser sharp, paper thin, almost 2 inch tall ear standing practically 90 degree vertically. Yes, some very talented sourdough experts do that on a daily basis like nobody #8217;s business. #129396; My biggest achievement though, is to pass on my *Steroids* to many people and help them start their own sourdough journeys. And I can say that I have discovered a few very skilled bread bakers. More to come! *Should have scored 366 as of the leap year!*  #129300; #129396; #128534; #129315; TOO LATE!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks a lot (you all!) He was a stray. By the time he was adopted, he was already middle aged. No one wanted him due to the black mark on the nose. (What a silly reason! It #8217;s a beauty mark!!!) They don #8217;t know how old exactly he was. Maybe 9-11? He was with my bro n SIL for 5 years. He was so skinny when he first arrived but grew to a 4.5KG big and handsome boy within a year. He was the most friendly stray I have come to know. His soft temperament made him the Mascot of my sister #8217;s company. She brought him around to different outlets till Dumpling fell ill. After that Dumpling was staying at home most of the time except for hospital visits. Dumpling had a good life thanks to my bro and SIL who are some of the most animal loving people I know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Silicon mats r basically glass inside and may break without knowing if using my stainless steel scraper on it. It is advised against using metal utensils on a silicon m #226;t anyway. But I don #8217;t like non-metal ones so...... I said so coz I was using one hard, self healing art mat before I had my stainless steel mat and it peeled off. I didn #8217;t want to end up eating rubber so I tossed it immediately Same reason for silicon mats Besides, I had one (the famous French Slip Mat) and it was very unfriendly to use and clean (rolled n unrolled). And when I tried to bake cookies on it the first time, it burnt in the oven at 180C. I couldn #8217;t return it as I bought it in Takashimaya department store in Singapore. Not sure why it worked for others but me. It wasn #8217;t a fake one. So there n then. I decided only SS stuff for me. That and my old trusted cast iron cookware. In case u r wondering why I didn #8217;t just use my granite countertop. I don #8217;t want to damage it as I may want to sell my condo one day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve made my best loaf to date - 10% organic soba sourdough! (It is of 30g Bob #8217;s organic soba flour + 271g of Bob #8217;s Artisan bread flour.) Dark brown exterior and light gray interior, nutty n tangy, soft airy centre without giant holes that fill up with too much butter or jam, no rice flour crust and a good ear included! It only took 13 hours to make, from feeding the starter to finish!  #128525; I finally realised living in a tropical country, the famous methods used in the 4-season climate just wouldn #8217;t work n always OVER PROOFED my bread! Cutting the time short is the key. Took almost 4 hrs for the starter to ripe and float but NO autolyse, NO lamination, NO coil folds, just a short stretch and pull of 3 hr/6x and into the fridge till the dough no longer grows bigger (BIGGEST key!) This loaf was in the fridge for only 5 hours. Now wait for the magic to happen in the oven.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I didn #8217;t add the wedge recipe as no one around me ever asked! It just didn #8217;t cross my mind coz ppl always asked for the rub only. I thought people rather eat French fries, honestly. This is just a very simple ordinary dish. Think about it - carb, protein, fibres and vitamins. I didn #8217;t expect to see so many questions about them when I woke up this morning!*  #129396; #128514; #129315; For the potato wedges, I have always used this recipe but instead of baking, I mostly shallow frying them as faster and tastier, give and take roughly similar seasonings, more or less chilli peppers. And sometimes, if I have leftover sourdough, I will use the crumbs to coat (but no eggs nor flour so it #8217;s not like a piece of Tonkatsu. If no diy bread crumbs, I will use sweet potato flour.shake off all excess. Just a bit to give an extra crunch. The author suggested using ice water to soak and it really does help. Also, using a cone shapes bowl with a piece of oil soaking paper to line the bottom for serving (like in pic) keeps the wedges crispy a lot longer while you cook other stuff as the oil doesn #8217;t trap inside the wedges (unlike sitting in a flat dish.) If you wonder what is an oil soaking paper, they are the paper Japanese use to soak up excess oil from the fried food such as tempura. I got mine from Daiso. There are many kinds. *The oil soaking paper is needed only if you fry them instead of baking.* [recipe link](https://www.errenskitchen.com/seasoned-baked-potato-wedges/)</TEXT>

No excess flour in the basket then fridge for 9 hours (coz I need to sleep) Scored right after taking out of fridge n before popping the dough into the hot Dutch oven. *I was aiming at no flour look on a quite high hydration dough.* So a quick slide of the lame (stuck a little 2/3 way down) Baking - 250C/fan/covered/25 min 200C/fan/uncovered/10 min (200C instead of 210C as the loaf looked darker than usual when lifting up the Dutch oven lid.) *No autolyse, lamination, delay salt nor any of the extras not stated above.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The wedges are wet from soaking in the iced water then quick rolled in spice n salt (quite a lot of it) n crumbs And this has to be done right before frying So have ur hot cast iron n hot oil ready and a splatter cover and gloves all the gears ready before u start The point is not to stick too much of the crumbs or flour or else they become crumbed wedges. But if that is your thing, by all means do that. Really no hard and fuss about what I cook. If they become breaded, we still eat them. No food should be wasted. And honestly, this is just the plating that #8217;s attracting so many people. It #8217;s simply a common dish of potatoes, chicken and vegetables.  #128519;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found the new raw cast iron thinner than the old enamelled ones (ivory pot on the top). And the raw one is also smaller in capacity and not as tall. The lid is also not dorm shaped as the enamelled version. I wanted to check out this product as thinking it might be a cheaper alternative for the Challenger Pan. NO, I honestly don #8217;t think so. The Challenger is a lot better in many ways. However, if you don #8217;t bake bread on a bigger scale and just want to try a raw cast iron Dutch oven and no access to Lodge (made in the USA), then it is a cheaper alternative from China. It is by all means NOT as rough as those no brand cast iron pans from China that I have seen locally at all. But it #8217;s being thinner and shallow preventing me from getting one to try because I only wanted to bake a loaf in it. I am sticking to my Lodge 7qt and the trivet in it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crumb shots of the  #128274; bread I made yesterday. It is 15% oat flour n rest is just bread flour. I tried slicing 1/2 into bigger pieces but found some parts too HOLELY so I slice the other 1/2 into smaller pieces. I am not one fond of bread full of big holes coz where does the dough disappear to?! I don #8217;t want to eat BUTTER w bread but BREAD with bits of butter.  #129396; OK I finally said it. NOT a fan of the popular extremely lacy sourdough. Also, it is interesting to know that I only cold retarded the dough for slightly more than 5 hours as it stopped growing bigger and wet finger test showed it was ready to be baked. As usual, no autolyse, no coiled fold and all the fancy stuff. I just fed my entire starter, scooped out what I needed and 6x of stretch n fold for 3 hours and rested the dough for 20 min more before shaping. And just shaped it once. It then went into the fridge till being baked. *I am the laziest sourdough baker on the market!*  #129315; #128517; #129396;</TEXT>

You don #8217;t need the dry milk powder called for either. https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/thin-crust-pizza-recipe The site also answers your questions too but not sure how responsive now at time like this. Also, I am not sure if your flour is all purpose or bread but you can check the amount of its protein. If about 10% then it is all purpose. If about 12%, then pastry. If about 14% n above, then bread. Good luck.</TEXT>

Method: Wash meat and keep in colander till the water drains. Heat oil in a pressure cooker. Add heeng to oil. Add meat and stir-fry well. Add clove, cinnamon, powdered black elaichi, zeera. Stir-fry till color of meat turns light brown. Add red chili powder, and yogurt. Fry again till no white color of yogurt is visible. Add ginger powder, fennel powder , salt and  #189; cup of water. Pressure cook for 5 minutes.or 3 whistles. Turn off stove and open cooker when pressure has dropped. Check for the desired tenderness. If you see excess water, boil till desired consistency is reached. Grind zeera and green small elaichi and sprinkle on meat and cover. This will give exotic aroma to meat.  #8226; Serve this dish with white rice or paratha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If u can #8217;t find it or don #8217;t like its distinctive smell, just omit it. I see why not! I often cut corners when I am short of something. Times like this is especially difficult for many. Good luck and hope this recipe works for you. I am not of Indian ethnicity but I surely love the food and culture. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure if this has any scientific base but my mother-in-law told me if vegetables tasted bitter, it is usually due to chemicals used. I normally soak all vegetables and fruits in baking soda water to remove whatever chemical residuals, even if it #8217;s organic as I am not sure if it #8217;s 100% chemical free. Call me paranoid even if soda water doesn #8217;t work. I also have a Panasonic water filter that has high alkaline setting for washing vegetables and fruits so sometimes I use that water to soak the greens for 30 min. As for seasoning, I only used wee bit of oyster sauce and white pepper powder. HTH</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used a lame, slid it into the edge at about 40 degree angle, *SLID* the blade fast in one quickly motion. (Not *cut* but dragging the blade w one motion fast. If low hydration, do this slowly.) As the started splitting fast, I didn #8217;t go over the left edge to make a *flap* (by doing another slower lamb sliding).  lt; #8212; That flap is normally the key to get the ear if that #8217;s what you are aiming at. But since the dough was opening sideways fast, I didn #8217;t want to risk losing its strength so I skipped that n pop it into the Dutch oven and baked it. Many pros can do this with ONE cut all the time. It is not so for me. I am also practicing that. Hth</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it is just a preference for many people, especially in the west. For some reason, people like chewy and crusty bread than a soft spongy, say, Hokkaido Milk Bun or Hong Kong Po Lo Bao. My Asian family are exactly like you (and most Asians I know, esp far eastern Asians), avoiding chewy and crusty bread like plague, such as a French baguette. I am the only one who actually enjoys it and I bake the bread, sourdough mainly. So in order for me not to be fat as a pig by eating all the bread I bake, I STEAM each slice for them. Even when it #8217;s supposed to be toasted, I pre-steam the slices first then lightly toasted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry. I forgot to take a pic after scoring All I knew was to put it into the oven fast as the opening kept getting wider. What I did was scoring the large and deep curve with a lame then went over with a pair of scissors to cut the  #8220;teeth/fire #8221;. Then quickly did the light curved line with the lame on both sides. No, the oat flour didn #8217;t make much difference as only 10%. But somehow I feel the flavour is improved. Not sure it #8217;s due to oat or semola rimacinata though. HTH and thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I made some fiori di pasta (pasta flower) today, inspired by #baltimorehomecook who constantly amazes me with her pasta creations. First I made the dough with semolina, 00, buckwheat and eggs. Yes, I experimented with all the above for colour, texture and taste. Then I rolled the dough with my Marcodo Atlas 150 to No 6 so it #8217;s really thin hence reducing cooking time. Then I rolled the dough sheets with a textured dough rolling pin. Then I cut the sheets into small, fluted rounds of 2 #8221;? Finally I shaped each small dough disc into a tiny grey rose. I had a great time practicing to be a future  #8220;pasta granny #8221;...... They took bloody long to make! The perfect new project to learn during lockdown.  #129396; #128077; #129322; I made a simple sauce with tomato, garlic, sweet basil and some Spanish anchovies. To add extra protein, I fried some tuna with some Italian seasoning. Totally not sure what I was doing but it was a fruitful morning for sure! Told myself that I was making edible art.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*RECIPE* (op) This is a Malaysian Chinese dish. Yes misspelt the word and I apologise for my silliness that caused so much  #8220;discussion #8221;. Should have been wonton, or wan tan, or  #39195; #39145;. It not the Hong Kong/Taiwan style - big wonton with a large prawn in each wrapper and floated in a prawn soup that I grew up with. (I live in Malaysia now and we are under a long period of strict lockdown so I could only make this simple version without prawns.) These wontons are small n thin and usually comes with a dried egg noodle dish with some thinly sliced bbq pork slices. I just made the soup part to go with other dishes at dinner. Again, it should have had spinach and some chopped spring onions on the top. But I had some lettuce to be used up so I just used that. I used a Chinese water dough recipe for the dough but you can easily buy the thin square wrappers in a shop. wonton skins: To every 100g AP, add about 40-50g (slightly cold) room temp, tiny pinch salt n tiny pinch cooking oil, mix well bu adding water slowly to a not sticky ball, like pasta. Rest the dough for 30min. Pasta roller to no 7 so I got a very thin sheet. Cut thin squares w a cookie mould or pastry cutter. Filling: minced pork with some fat (not completely lean or else it will be dry n hard - I used not overly fat belly) salt white pepper black pepper tiny dash of Sao xing wine Wrapping wonton: Put a small teaspoonful of filling into the thin square wrapper, fold in half to a rectangle, then gather the sides to the centre. If using commercial wrappers, you probably need some water to seal. Homemade normally no need. Broth: a big pork bone, braised first, a big handful of Asian dried anchovies, also brasied, into IP, add 3 garlic cloves  amp; a piece of ginger (meshed a bit), Soup function 2 hours at least. Skim off oil, salt (n some tiny bit of fish sauce) to taste Boiling wontons: In a pot, boil water, add pinch of salt, when water boils, add in wontons. Lightly stir or shake the pan so the wontons don #8217;t stick. When they float to the top, cook a further min so they are cooked properly. (You can taste a piece to be sure). To serve: into a bowl, add cooked wontons, broth, n garnish Garnish: Spinach/lettuce sesame oil fried sliced shallots fried minced garlic Chopped spring onions (I didn #8217;t have any on hand so I just skipped it.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Blench super peas and set aside Pan really hot. Oil in. Add in steak and sear both sides fast. One min each side is enough. Don #8217;t worry if it #8217;s raw. Raw is better than cooked through. Set aside steaks. (Use the best cut you can afford. Here I use ribeye.) Rest the steaks for 5 min then slice them thinly. Trimming fats and hard tendons, if you want. (I did as it #8217;s easier to chew.) Put sliced onions into the same pan (which should be preheated again.) Cook it till slightly charred on edges. Add minced garlic. Cook briefly. Add in the sauce mix - Black pepper sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, water, shao xing wine If using a lot of meat, you make more sauce. I don #8217;t measure as it #8217;s by experience. When sauce thickens slightly, put in beef, stir quickly so they r not cook through. Turn off the heat and add in sugar peas. I normally don #8217;t bother with blenching but just use microwave vegetables function so the peas are cooked enough and still remain the crunch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(OP): I only use KAF No Knead Recipe and this was based on that recipe but not quite Again this is 1/2 recipe The 5% of Organic Instant Baby Oats is just dump and play from the beginning. NO grinding. NO cooking. Straight. (I like to use easy methods and what I have in the pantry for cooking n baking.) I raised the hydration to 80% - not something for beginners as the dough was super sticky and looks like a freebie turning out from the basket. Also not easy to score so I did only one line without decorations. I reduced the starter to 20% as most bakers use about that much only. KAF #8217;s uses a lot more. Salt also reduced to 2.5% No tricks but 6 S n F in 3 hrs and adding the wee bit (about 1/2 t) charchoal powder at the 4th S n F here n there. Too little charcoal to affect the taste. It #8217;s for visual only. Rest 30min after last Sn F Shape once Into fridge When ready, baked in a DO 250C 25 min fan covered 210C 10 min fan uncovered</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tks. I used KAF no knead sourdough recipe but reduced its starter to 20% of late and it #8217;s a game changer for harder flours like rye and whole wheat. KAF #8217;s recipe was great but mainly working for just plain bread flour (strong wheat flour). When I replaced some with harder flours, the crumbs became a lot tighter on and off (no stable results) so I looked it up online and found most pros only use about 20% for airy oil-free loaves and more starter for enriched breads. It works for me so you could give it a go by modifying the amount of the starter you use. (Edited)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no discard so I fed the starter, made the dough n into the fridge overnight. The muffins spread too much during 2nd proof on the countertop. I think it #8217;s the 20% organic oat flour I added. But then again, I also boosted the gluten with 10% semola rimacinata......  #129300; No matter.... the nooks n crannies never disappoint.... BTW, I don #8217;t like using the Lodge Mini can pans for them after 2 trials. Even though the pan keeps the muffins in round shape, the sides of the muffins tend to be more crispy than how soft they should have been. That pan is best for making biscuits. Unfortunately, biscuits need lots butter so I don #8217;t make them as often. Trying to be more health conscious. Don #8217;t fire at me!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(OP) Recipe (kind of): I cook without recipe so it #8217;s different from one to another. No QC.  #129315; For this particular dish - Vegetables: Hard: carrots, English radish, kale stalk - cut into same size. Nuke w vegetables function with some water. Remove from water and reserve. Soft: Yellow onions Swiss brown mushrooms, kale leaves - cut into same sizes. Aromatics: ginger - thinly sliced, spring onions - cut in matchstick length, garlic - minced Beef: Get the bets cut you can afford. Thinly slice across grains. Marinate it with: Chinese cooking wine (gao liang is the best and followed by shao xing), soy sauce, black pepper, oyster sauce. Massage the meat thoroughly. Then add in cornstarch and massage again till all starch #8217;s invisible. Finally, add in sesame oil and massage the meat again. Leave this in the fridge for about 1/2 hr. Wok: - high heat, add in oul then ginger slices, turn heat down a little and brown the ginger till all browned properly. Best cook ginger till it turns dark and crispy. Now bring up the heat to max. Add in beef, stir fry the beef all sides briefly. Some parts uncooked is OK. Turn off the heat and remove the beef n ginger. Turn the heat back up high. Add in spring onions and garlic, stir till garlic is lightly browned. Add in onions, then mushrooms and stir again till both r lightly browned. Add in hard vegetables. Stir. Add in kale the last. Quickly add in all beef and stir. Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, (black pepper sauce if you wish), black pepper powder, more cooking wine. And dish out.

    <TEXT>Hi i just woke up and had to reply this.... Not Malaysian but staying here  #128513; Places to get Real Lodge - Online - (sellers I dealt with sold genuine products) and I have not seen fake ones, TBH Dealers - there are 2 officially ETC (Starling Mall) and they have a stall in Mega Mall (same floor as ACE) And FKF (now online finally) All ACE carries Lodge too but not many selections (placed at BBQ section) Due to MCO, most stock run out either in store or online for most RAW cast iron. You can easily get enamelled ones still.... I did pay a lot more buying them from all places including shipped from the usa (Amazon). There is tax and shipping involved so naturally one has to consider those factors in. But with COVID19, Amazon now charges way too much for SnH (and probably same soon with the local imports services.) It #8217;s unavoidable so if you can still score them at an OK price, do get them. Personally I avoid all enamelled products as I had a Staub yonks ago and it had scratches and I dared not to use it as not knowing if I was consuming the coating. Luckily it was a gift so not feeling the pain. Yes I paid a lot more than what Lodge is sold in the USA, but they last forever (sort to speak) and I consider my Lodge a good investment. Now I am heading back to bed.....</TEXT>

Marinate them with: Chinese cooking wine.m, soy sauce, white pepper powder, grated garlic and ginger (Put in enough grated garlic and ginger so you don #8217;t need to add more when cooking.) Leave this in the fridge till needed. Min 1 hr. Make the sauce: Oyster sauce, hot fermented bean paste, si chuan peppercorn powder, bit more soy sauce, red or black vinegar (more than soy sauce), chillier peppers. Stir to taste. It should be hot, salty and somewhat vinegary. *I normally don #8217;t premake sauce just put in bits of this and that as I stir the lot.* Cut all the vegetables of choice and place them on a plate. You must have onions and bell peppers but the rest is up to you. (Here I also had: broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, French beans, mushrooms, English radish.  #8212; gt; I put in whatever I had in the fridge usually.) Heat the wok to super hot and smokey. Have a bottle of Chinese cooking wine ready. And some of those sauces you think you may need too. Some water as well. While woking is heating up work cornstarch into chicken, massaging the pieces till all coated properly. Add in quite a bit of cooking oil as we are going to deep fry the chicken. When oil is hot, add in chicken pieces. Fry them till lightly browned all over. Remove the chicken and most of the oil. Heat up the wok again. Add in all vegetables and fry them evenly and quickly. Add in sauce and stir, making sure vegetables are cooked slightly but still crunchy. Add in chicken and continue to fry. When wok is looking hot and the lot is seemingly dry. Add in some Chinese cooking wine. You may see some flame which is oK. Continue to stir and add some water bit by bit and the sauce will be thicken (with the cornstarch on the chicken.) This dish shouldn #8217;t have too much liquid so don #8217;t over do with liquid. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many traditional Chinese woks are actually made of cast iron, not exactly all carbon steel. I grew up seeing family using big n heavy ci woks of all kinds. Some you just left on traditional wood fire stovetops n needed to be moved by more than a person, say as big as a small table. Not a joke. But they were not as thick (as the round based bottoms) as modern ones made in the west which are all flat. This Lodge is super heavy not because of the size but its thickness n an extra thick disc base. That is designed for the contemporary western designed household kitchen. Flat is the word. It takes a lot longer to heat up compared to the traditional Chinese round bottomed. But it is ok once you let it heat up till it #8217;s smokey. Trick us to add a tall domed lid on when heating so it speed up the process. I find using a stainless steel cover is far better than the modern glass version, not good in heat preservation. Once I let it reach that stage, about 4 min on my fire stovetop in this condo, it is all good to get that wok heii needed for frying. Only the talk SS lid would work. Nvr glass for me. Also as Lodge is thick, it is also a fantastic smoker n doesn #8217;t create lots fumes in my condo with the heavy lid on. I just smoked a duck breast in it yesterday. Check my other pics here or ig if you want. You can Buy heavy cast iron woks esp round bottom ones easily in Taiwan , China or Hong Kong or even SE Asian countries where some old masters still hand beat them. I was going to get one but nothing suited for my condo flat fire stovetop so Lodge was the best second choice. I came from a long family history of generations of restaurant experiences so I can tell you we nvr use carbon steel ones. Maybe other ppl do. HTH</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have see many carbon steel ones here but frankly, I don #8217;t think they work better for me as I am used to CI so I stick to what I know Also, use a ladle to wokking instead of a turner. It #8217;s what I was taught to use. Easier to control liquid and oil and maintaining that wok hei needed for the wok. Oh whatever you end up getting, get a wok that has a round bottom *inside* the wok as it #8217;s essential for wokking. Lodge has a flat disc outside but maintain the round inside so it #8217;s great! A flat bottom in side a wok is not a real wok imho.</TEXT>

The recipe works up till about 15% of variations of flour but most stable if I use 90% of bread flour (or the equivalent of flour w similar gluten amount) and 10% of other stuff even w the difficult or zero gluten flours.

These were filled with pork and chives, a traditional filling we do at our family.

BTW, my gang prefer thicker and slightly more chewy dough as such.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Made a new pasta shape today - *Calamarata*. I made it with ridged ends (only on ends so like teeth or a serrated bread knife?) instead of the normal plain ones hoping the ridges would help picking up more sauce coz it #8217;s a thin sauce for seafood. From Internet: This tube shaped pasta resembles calamari rings, which is why it tends to be used in seafood dishes. Fresh seafood dishes are a staple in Italy, particularly the southern region. Calamarata #8217;s smooth texture with no ridges allows thinner sauces to coat the pasta allowing the sauce to shine. It also holds up well with chopped vegetables, like tomatoes or zucchini. A smaller version of this noodle is called calamaretti.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My family said this is possibly the tastiest fried rice I ever made and they wanted repeating it again tomorrow night. So I am jotting down what I did as I don #8217;t follow recipes, like 99% of the time. #129396; #128517; Marinate the minced lamb with salt and lots cumin powder. Heat up wok to super hot, in go the lamb and quickly stir fry and the lamb will release fat and continue to brown. Add in shredded shallots, and fry, followed by minced garlic snd continue to stir fry. Add in chopped cabbage and fry till cabbages are charred slightly on the edges. Add in overnight cold rice n continue to stir fry. Season with lots si chuan peppercorn powder, some soy sauce, hot chilli pepper powder (to taste). When the rice is all well cooked, add in chopped spring onions and dish up (skim off as much lamb fat as possible.) This dish doesn #8217;t need any cooking oil as lamb is very fattening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm The noodles I made for this is same recipe as all pasta, egg noodles, buckwheat and etc Just interchange accordingly 300g flour, 3 eggs, pinch of salt, stand mixer with dough hook, mix on low for 10 min, rest 1 hr. using Mercado atlas 150 pasta cutter, roll to no 6, cut into Tagliolini or rolled no 6 n using Spaghetti cutter. Dry noodles n cooked in boiling water just before serving Soup - meaty pork or chicken thighs. Using pressure cooker, add water, garlic. Cook till tender. Remove the meat and garlic n blend it w blender w some soup. Remove all bones but pour the blended meat back into the soup and add some salt and let it stand for at least 6 hrs or overnight. Bring soup to boil. Strain the meat off, leaving the whitish soup. Put noodles in a bowl, pour over hot soup that #8217;s seasoned with soy sauce. The soup will turn a bit dark after seasoning hence if u want to keep it white, add just salt. Or u can add miso n it becomes a miso broth. Add spring onions and whatever meat cuts you like.

    <TEXT>Lol It #8217;s probably the ultra fresh free range eggs and the 100% semola rimacinata (twice ground semolina flour) I used to make it golden. Recipe is simple - 300g semola rimacinata flour (or a blend of semolina and Italian 00 flour at 1:1 raito) 3 eggs (about 55g each without shells) Tiny pinch of salt (Add wee bit of olive oil if the dough is dry when kneading but no more than 2 teaspoons. I often don #8217;t add any oil unless using 100% semola rimacinata.) Knead till soft and pliable (I am lazy so a stand mixer at min speed for 10min) Rest for 30 min to 3 hrs max (I do an hour always.) Now ready to use. This is an old traditional Italian egg pasta recipe. If you want egg free, replace the eggs w HOT water but make it 150g to start with. The water is best boiled on the stove and add in slowly to combine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OP - I am asked about the recipes all the time.... I think I lost count of posting them. Maybe needing a FAQ button somewhere  #128517; #129396; #128518; Vinaigrette: grated ginger. Sesame oil, Zhe Jiang red vinegar (u can add wee bit of soy sauce if u wish. I don #8217;t.) Wrapper - 300g AP flour, 150g water, pinch of salt, mix and stand for an hr I used a Macardo Atlas 150 to roll till no 6 (and sometimes no 7 if want it extra thin.) NOT good and slow w a rolling pin like mom so I adopted modern method since yonks ago. (I do the something wontons, but rolled a lot thinner cutting into squares for those.) Cookie cutter to desired size. I think it was a 3 #8221; round for me as usual Filling to desire (normally we do pork, garlic chives, soy, one egg, grated garlic, white pepper powder, pinch of 5 spice, dash of sesame oil and sometimes more fancy add some prawns (dry ones - soaked n ground or fresh - chopped or whole) Wrap and seal, pleated or none (faster, easier to work w families esp there are kids or needed faster n making a ton.) Yes make a lot and freeze in batches for raining days. I do this all the time.

But then again, we haven #8217;t tried that great many. Just we only eat pizzas once or twice a year so I am not sure what to pare with. There must be far better alternatives than Tabasco. Just I am not aware of. Is ok....... not sure when we are having pizza again. Will go look see #129322; (Other than me, my family don #8217;t like pizza much. Don #8217;t ask me why.....)

And I was never offered wasabi either. (That is ok as not a fan. #128517;) And nvr offered the boiling water soup either. #129300; But yes tempura should have been the protein but we try to eat less deep fried stuff.

    <TEXT>Experimenting with very high fibre ingredients. I will cut back BRM whole wheat flour (18% gluten) if I am to add raw wheat germ the next time as not only it #8217;s high fibre but also high in gluten (30.76%) which may not settle well with some folks #8217; stomaches. #128517; Luckily the loaves are still soft and spongy.

    <TEXT>Actually, really no recipe if I have to be honest. Growing up it was mom #8217;s kind of cooking, a bit of this and that. I used a modern approach to do this. I sauteed the shallots, lots!, till browned but not burnt and drain off the oil. Reserved that oil (but not too many days) to add into noodles and whatnots as it #8217;s fragrant. Then I add everything into an Instant Pot and cook for 20min (I forgot i could have done the saut #233; ring in the IP itself!) Remove the star anise, add more water and seasoning if needed and saut #233; it again to get that slightly charred taste but careful do not burn it! The skin of the belly should be on but I cooked it a tad too long in the pressure cooker so you can #8217;t really see the pieces here. I was looking for an easier way to cook.</TEXT>

It took me about 20 min from beginning to tidy up the countertop (though I had the help of a pasta roller, a triangle cookie cutter n a stick.) @pastasocialclub on IG said fusi istriani is traditionally served with a hen and game ragu around Easter and sometimes infused with *pork blood*. I just used the basic egg pasta dough and made a usual rugu - beef, tomatoes, porcini, Swiss brown mushrooms, and red wine, coz fancy booze sounds a lot more appetising than possibly pathogenic blood I reckon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All organic multi-grain and multi-seeds gift loaves for my friend who just started chemo - I milled 10% seeds to replace the bread flour (per request) so they are smaller in volume. I added some whole seeds for visual effects. Did 16-hr COLD Autolyse again as the crumbs seemed to improve a lot on the first try. I can #8217;t slice these two to see inside unfortunately. However, they both feel very lightweight so I think they should be fine.  #129310; #129310; #129310;Baked them in the glass bakeware again but keeping the shallow sides up coz they have slightly elevated rims (so the bread bottoms weren #8217;t baked as evenly for the first 2 trials.) These 2 are much better for the improvement. Oven spring is just as good as using Cast Iron DOs. However, these browned a bit faster so I turned the fan off at the last 15min of uncovered baking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WTH just happened? ??  #129300; #128517; I decided to use the old trusted Lodge DO to bake coz I am a clumsy person with glass. I was burnt 2X using those...... #128580; Then I thought why not baking one loaf NAKED with steam created from hot water  amp;/or ice cubes in a small ramekin at the same time? After all, a turned upside down baking tray is sort of like a baking stone/steel, right? RIGHT?! (I tried a baking stone before and didn #8217;t like its slow heating time. And I #8217;ve been using a turned baking tray since then. Works just like a baking steel, if you ask me. Important thing is - fast heating.) So it #8217;s what I did! And you could see the Boule was growing so fast at the spot close to the HOT, HOT, HOT cast iron magnet! And when the Boule couldn #8217;t grow anymore at that spot, it went towards the ramekin. (Thank God it didn #8217;t stick to the DO!) The part closer to my lousy mobile lens didn #8217;t grow much the whole time. So the Boule (574g baked) is no longer a boule but a lumpy mass. #129315; It got a peaky ear and a tumour. The smaller Batard (524g baked) was baked more evenly and has a lot of big blisters all over. But the NOT-round-Boule only has some OK blisters closest to the DO. KAF No-Knead Sourdough Recipe with the following changes: *Dough composition:* 10% BRM organic whole wheat flour 10% all purpose flour 5g organic wheat germ 477g Caputo Manitoba Tipo  #8220;0 #8221; flour (15% gluten)  #8212; FIRST TRY! *Additions:* 10g honey 10g milled golden flaxseeds Cold Autolyse 7hrs Bulk - 5 SnF/3hrs (30min each n the last 1hrs, shaped n rested 30min more CR 11.5hrs Bake (too complicated to explain) Of course I operated on the crazy big loaf first! The biopsy showed the benign looking tumour is malignant after all.  #128560; Its crumbs are denser and a tad gummy. Possibly due to its being positioned in the hottest spot of the oven with cast iron DO next to it? Well, I had to slice it thickly as a result. But all is not lost with a little help of cheese and toasting. The part that #8217;s most undeveloped has the most even crumbs. Go figure! Sourdough never ceases to amaze me. We will see about the normal Batard in a day or two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The little elf ran out of time helping the shoe maker so it made only one? I gave the musical Batard to a friend hence the new bake. But it was an unsuccessful one! Mistakes: - I used 2 oval glass bakeware n found they were even harder to use than the round ones as the handles are interlocking. Imagine trying to remove the hot tops! - Zero flour used for shaping n on the tea towels with high hydration part rye dough (about 85%). Parts of the dough glued onto the tea towel when I inverted them out. I had to peel, pinch and patch those parts back. The part with 1/2 an ear was one.  #129396;  #128580; #128557; Will I stop the experiments with these dangerous glass bakeware especially I was born with 8 digits of trigger fingers (some surgically corrected and some are at stage 2-3)? I probably still will try it occasionally coz I am a sucker for staring at my dough growing in the hot oven.  #128580;Maybe it #8217;s high time to replan on the steam-in-tray-and-naked-dough-on-the-steel method.  #129300; No wonder almost all the time-lapse videos I had seen were naked loaves! #129300; However, after gotten burnt 2X/4uses, I probably should go back to my trusted Lodge Cast Iron Dutch Ovens as they are really user friendly and hardies! Most importantly, they produce evenly baked loaves even when I am at faults somewhere along the process..... PS: The bottoms were baked evenly in the ovals!  #129304;And I can #8217;t complain about the crumbs!  #129304; #129304; #129304; *KAF No-Knead Sourdough Recipe with the following changes:* *Dough composition:* 2g organic psyllium husk, 60g French T65, 60g BRM organic whole wheat, 30g organic rye, 30g all purpose, 420g Caputo Manitoba tipo 0, *Addition:* 10g honey</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I pan-fried a piece of Spanish Mackerel (son #8217;s fav but choose whatever fish u like) and forked the flesh into the pesto. This is nut-free but I used tahini though. (Again, family preference of tahini over nuts.) In a blender/food processor whisk these till the consistency u like - bunch of blanched spinach, 1-2 cloves of garlic, tahini or whatever nuts, anchovies, some EVOO Mix cooked mashed fish flesh and pesto, season with black pepper powder and more sea salt to taste. Toss cooked pasta w this. Add more EVOO and seasoning to taste, IF needed. Really yummy and a real complete meal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great Q! I have a love n HATE relationship w natural Banneton and eventually gave up on them. Reason:  #8212; gt; They couldn #8217;t be washed so I brushed off the flour and put them into the hot oven (residual heat from baking) and yet over time, they still shredded. Didn #8217;t like that ONE bit! (A bit OCD here) So now I only use glass loaf pans for Batards and glass bowls for Boules. I line them w tea towels and dust wee bit flour to prevent from sticking. And use the same tea towel to cover up the tops. NO extra plastic/garbage bags needed. I find the glass being NON-porous, retaining more moisture during the long 2C cold retardation (usually 10-17hrs depending on if I have the time to bake) As it keeps the dough wetter inside, the dough is usually quite flat and not bouncy when I take it out to score. Yup a lot easier to score too. And that moisture kept inside explodes during baking and, honestly, this gives far better oven spring than the breathable natural rattan(?) Banneton which cannot be washed and shredded over time (yucks). I don #8217;t use metal materials for long CR as sourdough is *Sour* by natural. I don #8217;t know if it may or may not react w SS (or whatever metal moulds esp. those with coatings.) But I am not experienced w metal vs sourdough so I really cannot comment on this. Just don #8217;t think I will try it. I don #8217;t even use any enamelled Cast Iron but raw ones for the reason that I don #8217;t want to accidentally consume the unseen, chipped enamel. #128517; I have some pics on my IG (same name) if u want to see. HTH Glass moulds are the way to go for me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neither It is an raw egg placed in a deep bowl with boiling hot water poured over till the egg no longer bubbles. You pour away the hot water and crack the egg and serve it over rice or on the side of toast (sometimes coconut jam n butter sandwiched toasts.) The locals eat it at breakfast or as a tea time treat. I am now in Malaysia. This is a typical way of cooking eggs here and in Singapore HTH (NOT Malaysian but been here for 20 years)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Baking in 2 Dutch ovens placed vertically in the Electrolux 72 L oven: Purposely made a smaller loaf for the 3.2qt combo (and bigger for the 5qt) as the 3.2qt tends to damage the ear in the past (hence I upgraded to the 5qt combo last year.) Results are great! Though the smaller loaf still got dented a little. I should have made it a little smaller. I love the soft and slightly open but quite even crumbs. (I sliced the smaller loaf first.) *Temp 28.7C avg while prepping the dough* *KAF No-Knead Sourdough Recipe with the following changes:* *Dough composition:* 2g psyllium husk, 10% French T65, 10% BRM organic whole wheat, 10% all purpose, 40.5% Marriages organic strong white bread flour (protein 13.4%), 29.5% Millers strong bakers flour (protein 12%) *Additions:* 10g molasses sugar, 10g flaxseeds (coarsely milled)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, my starter was extra active and we weren #8217;t short of bread so I experimented with CR length. These were baked after being in a 2C fridge for almost 25 hours. They lost their big bellies (3rd pic), not very big blisters (weird as being in the cold for a day) and a tad heavier than usual. Luckily, the crumbs are still passable.

    <TEXT>Just (rock) salt, rub it in the salmon all over, rest for about 1/2 hr in the fridge. Heat olive oil in med-low heat. Fry all sides evenly but skin for the longes (and foremost), add some dill if u have. Sprinkle freshly ground black pepper powder all over as u turn the fish (so the pepper gets toasted in the oil n creates more aroma.) Keep crispy skin side UP if eating immediately. We normally eat it as soon as it comes out and I tend to keep the skin at the bottom so it #8217;s easier for those who don #8217;t eat the skin but flesh only. The skin is still crispy when we reach it and it picks up more fish taste TBH. HTH</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Testing 2 flours from Granoro - Granoro Multicereali - It containing 3% natural wheat sourdough starter. I reduced the starter to 200g which I believe was still too much. Granoro tipo 1 - The website said it requires more water. I added up to almost 90%. The dough became very sticky and I had to do slap and fold. Beautiful rich flavour, the stickiness made it lacking of structure. Uneven but average open crumbs was the result of poor shaping. The upsides? Very soft and tender, NOT at all dense texture, unlike using 100% Granoro Integrale (whole wheat). Will surely use more of the tipo 1 as it #8217;s NOT bleached white and added lots whole wheat fibres. This is a very unique bread flour! As for the multicereali is concerned, I still yet to figure out how to handle that 3% of dry wheat starter with my own Steroids mixed in. Flour composition: 2g psyllium husk 5% BRM whole wheat 5% Granoro tipo 00 10% Granoro multicereali 80% Granoro tipo 1 20g BRM milled golden flaxseeds 15g molasses sugar n salt each</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The easiest way to make it is very unorthodox, tbh. I won #8217;t call it the authentic Chinese method but works really well with the modern cooking. For the sauce, 1 part of mild sweet chilli sauce (such as the Thai version) and 2 parts of tomato sauce (ketchup such as Heinz), some water. (More water on the side to standby.) Trick is to cut the pork fillet to thin slices, about 2mm thick max. Marinate the pieces w soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine (shao xing is great), grated garlic and some white pepper powder for about 1 hr at least Coat the pieces w sweet potato starchjust prior deep frying for best result. Or cornstarch for a bit less satisfying texture. Drain pieces of pork and set aside. Keep only wee bit of oil and fry onions, and whatever vegetables of choice till slightly charred on the edges. If adding tomatoes, add those the last. Add the sauce and stir. Add in pork and more water if needed as sweet potato starch can soak up the liquid really fast. Taste and adjust seasoning (tomato sauce n sweet chilli sauce.) garnish with some chopped spring onions (green parts only). Work fast l in a super hot wok. A soup or Chinese cooking ladle will help w the wok hei needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cast iron is thicker = better at retaining heat even though it heats up slower. And Lodge #8217;s thick n heavy flat base works well on my gas stove with cast iron racks on the top so the wok is steady n doesn #8217;t move about. I can #8217;t toss the wok and don #8217;t wish to as it is dangerous and means more cleaning for me, But if you prefer tossing food like some chefs, then carbone steel is a wiser choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My take on Strozzapreti, or whatever it is named. I rolled (to No 6) and cut the pumpkin pasta dough with the Reginette attachment of my Marcado Atlas to get the ruffled ridges first then I hand roll each strand to get the shape. It required fully air dried to maintain the shape before boiling. Made a garlicky fish and kale sauce for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This loaf is based on Baker #8217;s Percentage Chart posted @sourdough_tim on April 29, 2020. (Hope this is OK w Reddit and not deleted.) The following details is almost all the same as the previous post, except for being a much larger 500g loaf. I made this to test the recipe stability. The stencilling has improved this time but still too much rice flour on some spots. (Work in process.) *Dough Composition* Total 500g flour 50g wholewheat 25g buckwheat 425g Strong B flour 350g water **NOTE: There was still water from the starter and soaker so I reduced it to 70% at this point, same as the previous bake.) 15g amaranth 15g golden flaxseed Soaked both in 30g water together (3.5hrs) **NOTE: I feel 30g water was too much for the previous soak so I adjusted the proportion for this batch. 1:2 = seeds:water ratio (by weight) is about right so I am sticking to this version. 20% starter - gt; 33g Starter: 33g water: 34g flour (3.5hrs) Mix all with 2.5% (12.5g) molasses sugar, R30m Add 2.5% (12.5g) salt, R30m Stretch n Fold, R30m SnF, R30m SnF, R1.5hrs Shape, Rest for 50min Almost 11hrs CR at 2C (Placed at same location in the fridge.) Baked in the Lodge 7qt DO (as the loaf is bigger n the 5qt DO didn #8217;t seem to be a good fit.) Covered 250C/15m (fan) Covered 230C/10m (fan) Uncovered 210C/7m (fan) Uncovered 200C/3m (No fan) Uncovered 180C/5min (No fan)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just use a glass loaf pan n a kitchen towel or hair net to line it. U can use any containers to be honest. After having so many bannetons growing moulds or shred despite not washing them n put them in the hot oven after baking bread. (Am in a humid tropical country is why.) So i just use my old loaf pans, mixing bowls, whatever. If u still want to use bannetons, u can use rice flour (any gluten-free flour actually) or placing a kitchen towel in it. Surely works.</TEXT>
