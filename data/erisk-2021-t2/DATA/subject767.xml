    <TEXT>James 5:16 says we should confess our faults to one another, and that's an awesome thing you do that, but you don't have to hold onto your sin till a confession to be free - God can set you free if you ask him directly!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sure I get that, but what I'm saying is that you can go straight to Christ to confess. I'm offering encouragement that you don't have to hold onto sin to wait to see a priest to confess sin, but you can do it anytime! And thats an awesome thing that he's is there when we need him all times, so I don't see anywhere in the new testament that Christ works through specific people as a medium, but that we have access via a real relationship with him via Holy Spirit - that's a thing to get excited about! Our relationship with God is a deeply personal one that can also involve as many or little people as we choose. In our darkest moments it our Lord thats stands by us to lift us up again and forgive us - Great!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fighting against the tide in a relapse</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-11 09:02:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Relapse yesterday - one thing led to another and I ended on the slippery slope and looked at some silly stuff. I asked God for mercy and forgiveness, knowing I only fear Him, and repented. Its weird, like when I do it (watch P) I hate it and I'm going over in my head like, 'what on earth are you doing, stop already'. But there's that other part of me that continues to do it even though I know its wrong. I know I'm undermining Gods grace while I do it, but its like my brain shuts off. It's like this massive battle - I do it but I hate it, kind of like Romans 7 'I don't do what I want to do, I do what I don't want to do' - Does anyone else experience this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>worship skills? haha man, everything you do thats not sin can be done as worship to God! I suppose its like abstaining from any other desire - you become aware that you're picking up your cross to follow Christ, aware of your denial of self. The more of yourself and your sin desires you're able to leave behind the more selfless you become and you do things more out of the interest of others and God, and less for yourself, you could say</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mate, I admire your passion but a lot of people involved in driving this so-called 'industry' are equally lost in the world, without Christ. Remember God has given us undeserved, unearned grace, mercy and forgiveness and its important that we reflect that onto other people, especially those lost. Hate the sin, fight the temptations, stand ground, draw the line, but we must show mercy towards the person, regardless of the choices they make, because a lot of people don't know what they do. There is a lot of wrong in the world, and people are destroying themselves and each other through things like this, but God is the only one that can fully heal them. .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why should we? Because Jesus said so: "But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." leave them to God - "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord." It doesn't matter if they show mercy to not. It doesn't matter if they refuse what we offer. The bible doesn't tell us to not show mercy to the unbeliever, as far as I'm aware. I know you're mad about all of this, and I get that, but the fruits of the Spirit as more important - Gal 5 "love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."</TEXT>

Before I found out about Nofap a few months back I felt just like you - that I was the only Christian who had been fighting it, because no one ever talked about it within Christian circles - its like taboo, so I felt so alone. Its a journey but its awesome to see more and more people like yourself step up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you're doing is alright, like in James 5 "Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed." so when we surface our issues like this and share them there is a form of healing, or the start of healing. Because talking about it helps us release it. God has mercy on us when we ask, repentance is an important thing too though, which is being 'sorry enough to stop' but also being accountable for our actions and reconcile with the people which have also been affected. At the same time we can't change what we've done in the past, only what we do in the present with the time that God gives us. So my advice is also just try and focus yourself - if your in love with a girl then honor her and get off things like Tinder. But if you struggle with giving up that that then you may need to take time out to work on yourself - quiet your mind down and be alone with God until you're ready for the responsibility of a relationship. For me this is a massive thing, like when I relapsed recently I knew I wasn't in the position to seek anything kind of relationship with a girl knowing that if I can't be responsible as a single guy then there's not point pursuing girls. It all comes down to respect and honor. You build on respecting and honoring God and His creation. In turn work on understanding your self value and build your integrity - because when you see how much God values you, you will see the value in other people as well as yourself. I hope that helps as a starter at least - feel free to ask more.</TEXT>

Remember shes a daughter of God and should be treated with respect and honor - don't take something that isn't yours to take, because it can open gateways to all kinds of different stuff (in this case, consider that you may not have M'ed if you didn't make out with her).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think 1 Corinthians 6:18 was what you look for: "Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body." I relapsed a couple days back... I was so angry, not so much at myself but just generally. I feel so bad discrediting Gods grace. You turn your back on Him and then when you fall over you run back to Him. I felt like a massive hypocrite. The passions/desires wage war on you but you gotta fight. Everyday you have to fight. I'll pray for you. Heres another scripture from Phil 3: "But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead" You can't change what you've done, but you can change what you do going forward. Ask God for forgiveness but also ask him to help you, because he wants to help you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>getting out of a cycle like that can be hard when you go around in circles. Take a day at a time, thats my advice, just think "im going to get to the end of the day free" try and do something productive to take your mind off it - give someone a phone call, make a cake, read the newspaper etc. ... Or hang out in public all day - can't relapse in public! But really though, just get through that first day, dont focus on the 30 days yet. I remember I feel a million times better getting through my first day free following a relapse and the next day gets easier!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey bro heres a couple tips that work for me: 1 - leave your phone in the kitchen at night before you go to bed so it reduces the changes to relapse at night/in the morning 2 - Remind yourself: you feel better the next day if you don't take a peak. You may feels its right or 'good' at the time by having a quick look but that can quickly spiral and youll feel worse. Dont trick yourself with "it will be different this time" because it NEVER is. Fight the good fight my bro, its all about finding out your weakness and how to reduce your chance of relapsing. The first week is almost always the hardest so just do one day at a time till you reach some milestones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey yeah ive been caught out of little things like gifs and stuff before... and you try and justify to yourself its not as 'bad'... i know it haha. Its just a case of cutting things out piece by piece. For instance, one trap is you taking your phone out randomly/at any time and getting caught on reddit. Disable the internet on your phone and you've cut off an avenue right there (Maybe thats a big thing for some people but I don't use the internet on my phone). Things like that: identify a source and shut it down!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah theres always risk at anytime... I found that the first 2 or 3 weeks were the most difficult but the more time you spend distancing yourself from it the easier it becomes, especially if you're replacing PMO with new activity or meaning. I'm beyond 90 days and there are still moments I get tempted, that's just how it is, but I can manage it better. But yeah, under the right circumstances and environment anyone can fall despite their days....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Difference in dating vs relationship vs friendship?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-02 08:15:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I haven't really 'dated' anyone before but I've been in romantic relationships and I know there's a difference between the two but I can't figure it out. If I go out for coffee with someone, for instance, I just see that as hanging out with a friend regardless of whether I like them or not but people might consider that a date, even if thats not my intention. So what constitutes as actually dating someone? I know its a lot more casual but do you discuss the parameters of it (ie. "I would like to date you") or is it unsaid/assumed between the parties? Do you treat them as if they're a romantic partner and talk to them each day like a partner or do you maybe contact them once or twice a week like you would a normal friend? As I said I haven't really been a dating person because I like to have a clear line between being friends with someone vs being in a committed relationship, but when I ask my friends what they would 'do' when they 'dated' someone I don't really get a clear answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A method that a therapist gave me when dealing with the anxiety of certain people on your mind thats preventing you from sleeping goes like this: When you're in bed before you sleep start by imagining that you go and meet the person and choose deliberately to go on some kind of adventure with them but you must control the adventure and decide where it goes and the adventure must be over exaggerated. example: you meet the person outside your house and then you climb a ladder together into the clouds then the clouds turn into marshmallow which you start eating etc. all the while the person you're with is really over enthusiastic and happy to be there. Eventually you tell the person that its time for you to go and leave them where you met them. Then, in theory, that should relax you to help you sleep. sounds weird, but its worked a few times for me in the past, might be worth a shot.</TEXT>
