    <TITLE>Any advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 08:05:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>To preface I am 5 #8217; and 135~lbs but I want to weigh at least 125. I know to some it may not seem like that big of a deal but I am also a swimmer and I know besides aesthetics I just swim better at that weight. ( if i can get to 115 that would be wonderful ) unfortunately I tend to binge eat every once and a while and 4 years ago I was down to 119 but I just can #8217;t seem to stick to everything and I am honestly losing hope. I have tried to count calories and that worked 4 years ago but now nothing seem to work. Sorry for the long text but any advice would be appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always go for the feeling of exercise. I find that if I focus on how exercise makes me feel, it #8217;s easier to do it again. I personally like the feeling of working my muscles in just the right way. On days when I don #8217;t feel good or I can #8217;t work as hard as I want to/ normally do, I just tell myself that for today this is the best I can do. I try and work trough the hard days with the mindset that when I get to the good days, it #8217;s more of a treat. Idk if that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I get this too. It #8217;s really strange because I #8217;m pretty sure I want these people in my life but at the same time I never want to actually hang out with them? Idk it #8217;s very contradictory. Like for instance, my best friend came over today for the first time in about a month, we talked today for the first time in 2 weeks and I was just so tired at some points. She even asked me before she left  #8220;can you please try not to stop talking to me for another 2 weeks? #8221; (Don #8217;t get me wrong she didn #8217;t mean it in a petty way she was just genuinely sad I hadn #8217;t talked to her in so long) I don #8217;t know what to do with myself half the time cuz I could just so easily never talk to anyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I #8217;m not a professional but maybe you #8217;re restricting too much in the first place. I know from my own personal experience that whenever I restrict my intake too much I always end up binging later on and then I regret it. If you want to keep counting calories maybe move up to 1500 and focus on balancing every meal with protein, veggies, and grains. I always try and leave room for a treat at the end of the day because I have a major sweet tooth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1200 is way too low for anyone to be eating. Your metabolism has probably slowed down because it believes your body is in a  #8220;starved #8221; state. This can explain why you can seem to lose weight even though you keep going into a calorie deficit. At the very least you should be eating 1500</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should be focusing on nutritionally dense foods such as vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. If you make sure to include these in every meal it should significantly decrease the amount of times you find yourself craving more. Plus drink LOTS of water and I mean like 60- 80oz per day and even more if your work out regularly. If you #8217;ve been counting your calories at 1200 it will take a while to rebuilding your metabolism so don #8217;t be discouraged if you don #8217;t see results. Focus on how your body feels! You can still count your calories using apps like MyFitnessPal but try not to get hung up on being EXACTLY on target every day. I said 1500 but your current weight and daily activities are huge factors in setting a relevant goal in calories. For example some who is 5 #8217;2 #8221;, 135, and is an athlete could need anyway from 2300-3000 calories per day to even maintain weight. In comparison some one who is the same weight and height who is an office worker with little to no other activity could need 1800-2100 to maintain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone else feel like they functioned better in quarantine? Honestly when I was alone with myself...I feel like I was so much more productive. Once I got into a routine of doing work, eating right, and exercising I felt like I was doing better mentally than I honestly ever had in my life. (Not gonna lie tho before this happened I was in a trash state) but now that school has started I feel like everything I built up was just destroyed in a second... I feel so hopeless all over again.</TEXT>
