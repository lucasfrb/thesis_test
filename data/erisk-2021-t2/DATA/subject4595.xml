    <DATE>2018-09-01 12:05:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me tell you my tale of woe. It's a long tale for a really very tiny woe, but I need to get it off my chest.  #8203; There is a museum that I adore. Several years ago I purchased a membership; it was a family membership because I wanted to give them as much of my money as I could afford, although it is just myself and my husband. On the membership form I list my name (let's say "Sally Smith") and my husband's name (think "John Jones"). I list my name first; my name is on the credit card for billing.  #8203;I get the membership card in the mail. The names on it are "John Jones and Sally Smith." All the correspondence they send is addressed to "John Jones and Sally Smith." Huh. Somehow it defaults to his name being first, even though he does none of the work and is in fact not that interested in the museum. We have a good laugh about how he's getting all the credit for my philanthropy, but it still needles me.  #8203;When I send the membership renewals each year I add a note asking them to make me the primary member. It doesn't stick. Eventually I email the membership coordinator directly with my complaint; she was apologetic and said it would be corrected.  #8203;For a couple of rounds of mail I am happy to see it addressed to Sally Smith and John Jones. Recently for some reason it switched to Sally and John Smith, which is still irritating but I can live with it.  #8203;Part of the membership includes a free subscription to an unrelated magazine; in the past its address has matched what my museum showed on the card. But last month it showed up addressed only to John Jones. #$%@!  #8203;I unload on the poor membership coordinator of THAT magazine, who is also suitably apologetic and promises to fix it.  #8203;How does his name manage to get pushed ahead of my name for these things? Why is it so hard to put two names in two fields and leave them there? Are the fields in their system gendered, or does the person entering them decide that his name should go in the primary field? Ugh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Buttigieg also said the threat of automation  #8220;is about to give us another economic transformation, #8221; one that will cause real pain for middle-class workers.  gt;  gt;The mayor said such changes are a big reason Democrats are losing ground #8212;and that #8217;s something he doesn #8217;t think national Democratic party leaders on the coasts understand. This is from an [article](https://www.ibj.com/articles/65820-some-national-democrats-swoon-over-south-bend-mayor-pete-buttigieg) dated October 14, 2017.  #8203;  gt; Yikes. AI is already affecting jobs across USA  amp; automated driving will soon have big labor impacts in Midwest. We need leaders to get this. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/petebuttigieg/status/845339173649354753) dated March 24, 2017  gt; Buttigieg has repeatedly said that automation could decimate the current Indiana workforce. In a place like Evansville, which relies heavily on manufacturing jobs, the toll could be catastrophic. From an article dated July 31, 2018. He was the [head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors Automation Task Force](https://www.courierpress.com/story/opinion/columnists/jon-webb/2018/07/31/robots-stealing-our-jobs-heres-what-happens-when-one-steals-mine/865303002/) in 2018. If we keep trying to smear Buttigieg, it's going to backfire. Hard. He and Yang should be allies against the establishment, and we should be supporting anyone with ideas that will move our country into a future that puts Humanity First.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our vet has told us in no uncertain terms that he can't have ANYTHING except the prescription canned food/kibble and prescription treats. He has always been picky and we often end up throwing away two cans for every one can he eats. I know that "he will eat when he gets hungry enough" but is there really nothing else he can ever have in his life? What about low oxalate foods like cauliflower or peas (his stones were tested and were calcium oxalate)? And no Dingo-bone type chews or other things to keep him occupied? It's daunting trying to reorganize his life and taking away all the things he enjoyed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There has been a resurgence lately of silly references to Yang. He's not a "God Emperor." He's not the second coming of Jesus. He's a man with good ideas, trying to use those ideas to help other men and women. Every post that, joking or serious, tries to make him into something ridiculous does a disservice to his campaign. Someone stumbling upon this sub could immediately, and with good reason, dismiss Yang as a reasonable candidate--through no fault of his own. We are not a nation of puling lickspittles who need a strongman to follow. We are a collection of citizens who can and should model the best that Americans can be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This comment from u/Better_Call_Salsa was a little buried in the thread, but I think it's important for us to see and understand.  gt;There's how many comments on this thread, but zero comments on the phonebanking thread. There were two entries for the phone-banking contest yesterday, which cost me 60$ and has no sponsors for the future. We've failed to meet those daily goals for a full week now - nobody here's up in arms about it. No campaign staff is telling people about it. So here I am, working outrageously hard and coming up short in almost ever regard b/c I can't get people focused on what actually matters, and go to look at the board and it's 50 fuckin posts about how everyone OTHER THAN US is at fault for our failures. It's the DNC! It's the MEDIA! It's the one-armed-man and his cousin! Hundreds of posts about how crooked the system is, how unfair and upsetting and whatever else - but there are 10 PEOPLE MAKING CALLS. TEN. Read [the whole comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/enn9ss/yang_pulled_me_in_with_intelligence_and/fe49pse/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x), and think about what your own post/comment is contributing and how it is helping Yang (and our underappreciated mods) before hitting the Submit button.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Policy suggestion: every deployment of US troops should trigger an automatic surtax on American citizens to help fund the operations.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-13 12:14:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Or a surtax on gas, or something else that is fairly universally consumed. If something is important enough to put our troops in harm's way, it is important enough that we should all willingly help in the effort. For too long the burden of military service has fallen on an increasingly [tiny fraction of Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/us/military-enlistment.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab) and their families. If we expect them to risk their lives and spend months away from home, we should be willing to pony up a few bucks to help out as well. All of us. It's obviously not an equivalent sacrifice, but it's a step better than everyone going about their lives without even a thought about who is being deployed and why they are being deployed. Maybe our leaders would be more thoughtful in how our military is used if they had to justify the horror of tax increases with every military adventure instead of just...loss of lives.</TEXT>

Consider submitting resolutions about automation and UBI, or any of Yang's policies that you think is important for Democrats to embrace going forward. It's not enough to get Yang into office; we need to move the conversation so it is centered on his vision for the future, and his solutions to the problems we face. You can find some examples and information about resolutions from other progressive groups for ideas about the process and the wording to use: * [How to write a resolution](https://www.bleedingheartland.com/2012/01/02/how-to-write-an-iowa-caucus-party-platform-resolution/) (from Bleeding Heartland--old, but I assume still good information) * ACLU's [Introduce a Resolution at your Caucus](https://www.aclu-ia.org/en/introduce-resolution-your-caucus) * [Resolutions from ICCI](https://cciaction.org/in-the-news/all-the-caucus-resolutions-youve-ever-wanted/) for examples * [Iowa Sierra Club Caucus Resolutions](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/iowa-chapter/political/CaucusResolutions.pdf) Anyone with a literary bent feel like writing up some Yang-based resolutions that people can print out and submit?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't "save the Republic" by giving Trump another 4 years to wreck it, that's for sure. This is nothing more than a vanity project for Weinstein and others who want to virtue-signal their dissatisfaction that their chosen candidate didn't get the nomination. *There is no realistic path to success*. Yang wants Biden to win. He had the opportunity to run as a third party in the beginning. He chose to run as a Democrat. He had the opportunity to stay silent when he dropped out of the race. He chose to endorse Biden. He clearly sees the Democratic party as essential to his future success, and whether you agree or not, asking him to turn his coat and break his word so he can headline Weinstein's fan-fiction campaign would irretrievably wreck his reputation as a man who thinks things through and says what he means.</TEXT>

How about this nice dog we can adopt for free that has most of the same characteristics as the pony with the added benefit that we can actually *get* the dog?</TEXT>

Yang needs those "boring ass Democrats" to get his policies passed. The GOP isn't going to do it. Lackluster disengaged non-voters aren't going to do it. You seem to want Yang to make a spectacle of himself, because we have been taught to expect spectacles from our political leaders. That's not normal. That's not something to be encouraged. Yang's strength is his ability to speak about complex issues in ways that relate to regular people--but also in ways that don't irritate or alienate people.

Yang thinks that Biden and the Democrats offer him the opportunity to move his agenda forward. I trust his judgment, and will work with him to get Biden elected. What we "MUST" have are people working at all levels of government, every year and every election, to speak about Yang's agenda and policies. That means talking to your neighbors, family, and friends about UBI and other policies you believe in. That means following your elected officials on social media, attending their town halls, and asking them about automation, UBI, and other policies that are important to you. It means joining your local political organizations and working with them to incorporate Yang's policies into their platforms at a local and state level. It does not mean a hastily-put-together effort to undermine the man and the party that Yang has decided would be the best opportunity for him and his future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So--you want me to take your own argument, make it better, and then let you argue with the points that I've improved for you? Why don't you just make a better argument to begin with? When I am trying to convince people of something, I know it's *on me* to convince them. There is no expectation that they go out of their way to absorb or consider my argument; I need to make it easy for them to understand and palatable so they don't dismiss it. No one is obligated to listen to you. It's *your job* to convince them that your point of view is the best choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That may well work for good-faith arguments where both sides are working towards the same goal. In this case, the same set of questions have been asked. And asked. And asked. And not answered. In this particular, more recent sequence, [four questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/hm4iah/bret_weinstein_suggests_yangmcraven_duo/fx5iy31?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x) were asked (again). None were answered with anything more than vague generalities. I'm not about to build an entire argument for them out of whatever wisps of wishful thinking comprise the current basis of this plan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zoos are often the first, and sometimes only, exposure that children have to animals beyond family pets. That connection can help them develop an interest in the animals, and lead them to learn about them, their habitats, and the challenges they face. Which can lead to them advocating for preserving habitat and educating others in turn. Most reputable zoos also focus on educating people about things like climate change, endangered species, and habitat loss. People don't care about things they aren't exposed to, and zoos give people insight into parts of the world that would otherwise go unseen and unnoticed. I'm not going to presume to say that the animals in zoos would prefer a comfortable, well-fed life in a smaller enclosure to a shorter, harder life unconstrained in the wild. But zoos aren't an absolute evil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;We will need fair taxation. Countries will have to work together, exchanging data, to stop people and corporations from evading taxes. We must all pay our fair share. In good conscience, we can no longer privatize profit and socialize loss.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt;Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, among the richest people on the planet, have both advocated for the rich to pay more in taxes, the lack of which has led to a growing and enormous disparity. According to #160;[Credit Suisse #8217;s 2018 Global Wealth Report](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/publications/research-institute/global-wealth-report-2018-en.pdf), 10 percent of the world #8217;s richest people own 85 percent of the wealth.  gt;  gt;Multinationals too are not paying their fair share. Apple, Amazon, Google and Walmart to name just a few, generate mind-boggling profits and, after taking advantage of all the wrinkles in tax systems, pay limited amounts. **If the top 1,000 corporations in the world were fairly taxed, it would allow for a modest UBI to be tightly and reasonably dispensed across the world.** Something is simply wrong and broken when governments are deprived of funds they should justifiably have to construct a better state. \[emphasis added\] Americans, and one party in particular, are going to need to grow up and recognize that taxation is not "theft", and that appropriate taxation is good and necessary to build the kind of world people want to live in. And yes, it may take a global effort to ensure the wealthy don't abscond with the capital they've extracted from our countries. But it is going to need to be done, one way or another.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a very limited view of American life and the people Yang needs to reach. Many voters--especially older, politically engaged voters--are more interested in being informed than in being entertained. Continually pushing Yang to appear specifically on "non-PC" shows, and focusing on social media and trending hashtags is the same problem he had during the campaigns. We are only reaching the same audience that is already engaged. Older, voting Americans listen to NPR and their local public and talk radio shows. They read their local newspapers. They watch whatever the current equivalent of Oprah is. They watch cable news. Expand our horizons, talk to some people over 40, and figure out how to reach those engaged and reliable voting blocks in addition to reinforcing Yang's dominance with the "non-PC" crowd. While keeping in mind that many of the voters Yang needs to win in the future may have a more PC bent themselves.</TEXT>

Really--we need to get out of this internet bubble and talk to real people, in real life, and find out where they get their information and how we can best reach them. That's not to say that these people aren't good outlets for Yang to reach. But again--this is an extraordinarily limited reach and it really doesn't expand Yangs base much, if at all, beyond the people he has already been reaching.  #8203; Edit after your edit: I had to google every single one of those names except Gervais (I've heard of Seder and Pakman in passing but have never come across them outside this sub). As I said, I am old. There is a HUGE world world of people who spend minimal time online.

    <TEXT>I gave several examples of how Yang can talk to people in real life in my comment above. I'm simply saying that we need to be mindful that there is a world outside the internet, and it is important. Buttigieg had an excellent ground game with a very small internet presence. If you looked at Biden or Warren's sub, you would wonder why they were even running. But they had far more real-life exposure and support. We can't forget that while we focus on overlapping spheres of internet influence simply because it is cheap, easy, and what people here know. By all means, get Yang on Brand's podcast, and all those other people you named. But unless we expand outside our comfort zones, Yang is going to remain a niche candidate with a small but devoted following.</TEXT>

Is it an endorsement of Yang's plan for [democracy dollars and his other campaign/electoral reforms](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/restoring-democracy-rebuilding-trust/)? Or maybe a recommendation to look up [Biden's plan to reduce the influence of money in politics](https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The one "serious" accusation against Biden fizzled out when the accuser couldn't maintain a consistent story and continued making it more and more outlandish after her original story failed to gain traction. Several media outlets were unable to confirm her story. Further research also called her overall credibility into question. I think Yang has a much better grasp on Biden's character than you, random person with unknown motivations on the internet. I'll stick with Biden and Yang. Honestly, if they are having so much trouble digging up dirt on Biden and making it stick that they have to go back to this trough, I'm feeling pretty good about him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; there's no way you take 90% of someone's hard work People making that much money likely aren't working 10,000x harder than the person on their feet all day taking orders at Taco Bell. Nobody's labor is worth that much. The amount of money they are siphoning from our economy can be seen as straight-up robbery as well. All the cash the Walton family has, for example, comes at the expense of workers not earning a living wage and getting reasonable benefits. Same goes for Amazon and many other large companies that thrive by not compensating their employees appropriately. I'm not saying a confiscatory tax is necessarily a good thing. But clearly allowing the ultra-wealthy to simply abscond with ridiculous amounts of money that could instead be invested in our country's lasting infrastructure and other shared goods has not been working for the past several decades.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I agree with the three points made (remove Trump/Devos; turn the Senate blue to pass Yang-friendly legislation; shorten the work week), the rhetoric and framing is far too histrionic and detracts from the argument. Framing it as a "Devos/Trump Death March" just makes it easy for people to dismiss as a hyper-partisan message meant to gin up emotions instead of persuade with facts. Flood red states with "civilized blue state people"? No. This isn't a case of blue state good/red state bad. It's a case of needing to speak to and persuade our neighbors and fellow citizens to consider and vote for Yang policies. While I certainly wouldn't discourage progressives from moving to those wide-open spaces if they like, don't pretend that there is anything more "civilized" about them. People have different values based on different life experiences; our job is not to dismiss those whose experiences are different but to find a connection with them and make common ground.</TEXT>

His job may be more complex or require more specific knowledge, but you're kidding yourself if you think billionaires are actually working that much harder than regular folks on their feet 10 hours a day for minimum wage. How great is his risk of contracting Covid at work, for example, compared to the people who kill and process the cows, pigs, and chickens we eat? This John Galt fantasy where "makers" up and leave to create some tax-free utopia is nonsense. These people require actual workers to *do the work* that makes them money. Bezos needs all those workers, even if he doesn't think he needs to compensate them fairly. As does Walmart. If nothing else, they need people who can afford to buy their products. None of them become obscenely wealthy in a vacuum. They need to Buffet and Gates it up and recognize that they are part of a whole.</TEXT>

Sometimes their ideas are even snapped up by those with more wealth, leaving the actual creators far less wealthy than those with the power to take advantage of them.

    <TEXT>Although in the US the word "liberal" is normally associated with the Democratic party, I think this article does a good job of laying out how both sides of the modern US political spectrum encompass aspects of this "liberalism" and its flaws. I found this part particularly interesting, given the other recent post here where many were skeptical of the benefits and even necessity of taxing the ultra-wealthy for the greater benefit of our country and its institutions (emphasis added):  #8203;  gt; An older #8212;and truer #8212;conservatism recognized that economic health was essential to human flourishing, but was as wary of *too much* wealth and *too much* inequality as it was of *too little* prosperity. John Adams, for instance, wrote of the need for "sumptuary laws" #8212;bans on "luxury" #8212;because ***excessive*** **wealth was as dangerous to the virtue of republican citizens as was too little prosperity**. "Whether our countrymen have wisdom and virtue enough to submit to them, I know not; but the happiness of the people might be greatly promoted by them. ...Frugality is a great revenue..., curing us of vanities, levities, and fopperies." Many of the members of the Founding generation, whom authors like Goldberg and George Will are ever-eager to cite and, expressed **grave concerns about the corrupting effects of wealth and the need to balance commerce with the cultivation of civic virtue. They discussed how an economy must be governed by concerns for the common good** #8212;especially to support the modest and frugal habits, avoidance of debt, and the predominance of "middling" circumstances of most people.</TEXT>

It's a little defeatist to declare after a few months that no one cares and everything is horrible and won't get better.

Considering almost nobody had even heard of UBI a little over a year ago and now people are talking about it as if it is really possible, we have come a long way in a very short amount of time.</TEXT>

Things like this, laying out the basic universal needs that every American must have met, are helpful for establishing a baseline from which policy should be developed. There aren't many people who would disagree with these points unless they are already deeply embedded in an ideology that refuses to acknowledge them. And I'd argue that this is why Yang resonated with so many people across the political spectrum: he was focused on this kind of basic, universal need without getting too wrapped up in the splintering variations and interests that keep us from uniting around a common cause.

    <TEXT>You're not wrong, and I think I replied to your comment on another thread mentioning that it has been this way as long as I've been on this sub. Yang has a subset of supporters who loathe "the establishment" and thought he would be the candidate to break through and somehow reduce their hold. Others are just out to \*sigh\* "secure the bag" and couldn't care less about any of his other policies. And a non-zero number are certainly trolls or here in bad faith to stir up anger and division on the left, exactly as happened in 2016. They are not interested in his policies, so they have no reason to help support Biden. They confused Yang's reluctance to attack Trump on the campaign trail with an absence of animosity, despite Yang's repeated declarations that one of his primary goals is to get Trump out. But many of us were drawn to Yang because his platform embodied the policies we want to see--ALL the very progressive and innovative policies. We liked the way he spoke about problems and solutions without phoning in easy culture-war talking points. We want to see Yang's agenda moved to the forefront of Democratic politics, and we are working with Humanity Forward to help elect downticket candidates who will promote his policies and advance UBI. Most of us here want Trump gone. I'd wager the majority of us will vote for Biden, if we can't have Yang. But there is a sizeable and vocal minority whose hostility to Biden and the DNC overshadows their support for Yang.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I'm seriously asking that question. Yang didn't want to be president: he wanted to get UBI into the conversation and passed into law, and he saw running for president to be the best way to make it a reality. And he's doing that. He is working with the Democratic party to move his agenda forward. It's really as simple as that. There's no nefarious secret bending of the knee or blood oath. If you look at Yang's policy page, it has a lot in common with fairly standard Democratic policies. He considered himself a progressive before running for president. Given that you think Yang has willingly tied himself to a supposedly "corrupt and diseased" (we'll gloss over the somewhat fashy use of words meant to evoke visceral reactions of disgust in an audience when describing political opposition--again, something Yang never stooped to), do you still support him? A more obvious take is that Yang was a standard Democrat all along, but suppressed that once he saw how much traction he was gaining with non-Democrats. Now that he is not running for president, he is free to be more open about his alignment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Democrats are cautious because every time they get a "win", two years later their voters don't bother to turn out and the GOP takes over to undo any progress that was made. That makes Democratic leadership think that the electorate is more conservative than it perhaps is. If most people really want Bernie (or whoever)-style legislation, why do they keep giving Congress back to GOP candidates who are diametrically opposed to everything Bernie stands for? If you want Democrats to be boldly progressive and push the envelope, we need to give them cover and support. You don't get progress by whipping from mid-left to far-right every 2-4 years. You get it by electing Democrats up and down the ticket, consistently, so they can continue to move things forward, instead of inching half a step forward then being pushed back two steps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A portion of Democrats *do* represent the progressive left. And a portion represent the moderate centrists. That's the point of having a big tent. And *my* point is that the centrists, looking at a spectrum from far left through center on to far right, sees Americans consistently bouncing between moderate left and far right. They imagine themselves to be closer to the far right on the spectrum than the far left are, so they see no reason to abandon the center in favor of the far left. Take a look at [this chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses#/media/File:Combined--Control_of_the_U.S._House_of_Representatives_-_Control_of_the_U.S._Senate.png), with almost unbroken Democratic control of Congress from the 1930 through the '70s.

How is he more qualified than any of the other people Biden is considering? Why would choosing Yang be better than choosing Warren or Buttigieg, both of whom did far better in the primaries than Yang? Is Yang ready to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, never having held elected office or been accountable to voters? I love Yang. I think he'd be great. But you're going to have to have an amazing story to convince people that he is more qualified than the likes of Warren, Rice, Harris, Duckworth, or any of the other names that have been floated as VP contenders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can understand that perspective, although I don't agree with it (and I don't think your characterization of Biden is necessarily grounded in reality). But the fact remains that either Biden or Trump is going to be president next January. Just like in 2016, we are seeing people trying to poison the Democratic candidate and divide Democrats to depress turnout in order to help Trump lurch into office again. Constantly complaining about and smearing the Democratic candidate has one result: hurting the Democratic candidate. When we have a binary choice--and we do--that means it helps Trump. I don't want to see that happen. Yang certainly doesn't want to see it happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's one bill, maybe two before the midterms. Plus the fact that they will likely water down whatever is passed to make it palatable for Democrats from more conservative districts. Tax cuts are simple compared with the vast and complex legislation that would be required to pass either UBI or universal healthcare; I'm curious how that kind of legislation could be made to fit within the strict rules of the reconciliation process (point of correction: the ACA/Obamacare [wasn't passed via reconciliation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamacare-was-not-passed-using-budget-reconciliation/2016/01/22/e72d321a-bed5-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51_story.html)).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. I feel Yang is doing amazing things, getting people on board with his agenda and working within the Democratic party to lay the groundwork for UBI and his future political career. Let's be honest, Yang wasn't ready for the presidency this year. But he is doing what he needs to do, and we need to do the same. Moping because our guy didn't win is useless. Start engaging with your local political groups and talking to them about UBI and Yang's other policies. Reach out to your elected officials on social media and at town halls and ask them about automation, UBI, carbon pricing, and other Yang policies. Complaining is a waste of energy; action wins.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a little discouraging to see this sitting at 4 upvotes, when spammed memes and divisive snark posts get far more engagement. This is an article that speaks well of Yang's ideas from a finance angle. And it points out the crucial difference between Yang's UBI and the current emergency stimulus proposals: Yang actually has a plan to pay for his UBI.  gt;The concept of UBI, a cornerstone of Yang #8217;s unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, is an interesting one. It starts with the observation that the economic realities are changing. Globalization and automation have accelerated the trends towards income and wealth disparity, with an increasingly large percentage of wealth in this economy being concentrated in ever fewer hands. It doesn #8217;t take a genius to realize that that is unsustainable.  gt;  gt;The answer, according to Yang and other proponents of UBI, is to accept that everyone in society has a role in wealth creation, even if just as a consumer, so everyone should share in the proceeds by way of a universal income check. It would be like Kudlow #8217;s $1200, only without restrictions and it would come regularly, even when an election was a long way off.  gt;  gt;Oh, and there is one other crucial difference between the Yang plan and the White House #8217;s current watered-down version: Yang had a way to pay for his.  gt;  gt;The thing that makes UBI unacceptable for some people is that in order to pay for it, taxes on the very wealthy would have to be raised. One can argue that the tax hike would discourage investment and wealth creation, probably enough to at least offset the stimulative benefit of putting money in the hands of people who will spend it. There is a debate to be had there, but in Yang #8217;s defense, he never pretended otherwise. Further into the interview on Sunday, on the other hand, Kudlow talked about tax credits for businesses that were in the proposal, which #160;would also cut tax revenue. Nobody seems to care anymore about a Federal debt of #160;[$26.5 trillion and rising.](https://www.usdebtclock.org/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Social media companies need to take accountability for the large number of adolescents using their services to create safer online environments, said Andrew Yang, a former Democratic Presidential candidate and commentator on the report.  gt;  gt;Social media companies should first verify the ages of children on their sites, Yang said. About half of adolescents have some form of social media by age 12, according to another [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-plugged-in-parents-of-tweens-and-teens-2016) report.  gt;  gt;"Social media companies do have some age restrictions, but it is absolutely the case that millions of kids easily circumvent those restrictions because there's really no effort made to actually check how old the kids are," Yang said.  gt;  gt;The report also stated that more children are looking up mental health information online, but there are also almost no digital mental health tools designed for adolescents.  gt;  gt;In his commentary for the report, Yang discussed the need for public schools to include curriculum about mindfulness and the responsible use of technology. "In this period of time, we have to try and deliver people tools online," Yang said. "It makes sense to me that there are very few mental health resources that are available for kids, so we should be investing in those." It's good to see Yang being seen as a thought leader on a variety of topics, not just UBI.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting read. It does seem silly for our country to continually lurch from extreme right to moderate left every 2-4 years, each party working to undo the other's progress (or regress) instead of working together to build solutions that allow the Democrats to temper the inherent cruelty of some of the harsher GOP plans, and the GOP to rein in some of the Democrats' more profligate tendencies. Both sides should balance each other's weaknesses, not fight one another as avowed enemies. And the practical solutions offered align nicely with much of Yang's plan for restoring democracy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a tricky needle to thread. On the one hand, I completely agree that the unemployment benefit and other short-term stimulus packages are not UBI, and trying to brand them as such has the potential to also saddle UBI with any potential backlash to the negatives of these stimulus packages--which are neither well-planned nor funded (as Yang's FD would be). But on the other hand, is it helpful to use this as an example of what UBI could be, on a small scale, to help Americans understand that the government can provide the basic means of living to people without reliance on companies and industry to employ people?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No one has given me a clear understanding what a mask mandate might mean. It's quite simple. Elected officials say "You must wear a mask when \[inside, in public within 6 feet of others, etc.\]". Now there is an expectation that people wear masks in these situations, and those who aren't wearing masks can easily be refused service. Just go to Iowa City and see how many people are wearing masks compared to places without a mandate. I doubt there has been any enforcement or citations issued, it is just creating the societal expectation that masks are necessary. Just like there is an expectation for people to wear shirts and shoes when entering a shop--sure, there will always be the occasional weirdo who flouts conventions but for the most part humans want to behave in a way that is aligned with the behavior of others in their community.</TEXT>

Or what the overall point is--are you trying to discourage people from voting for Biden because a Biden win would reduce the already minuscule likelihood of Yang getting the nomination in 2024? Let's take a moment to remember that Yang wasn't running because he wanted to be president. He was running to call attention to automation/UBI and get people to start considering it as a serious issue. And he is doing that, and is doing a damn fine job of it as he develops relationships and collaborates with Democrats and promotes downticket Democratic candidates. If you only supported Yang because you liked him as a person and were indifferent to most of his progressive policy ideas, I can see where this post would make sense. But if you came to Yang because you thought he was the best embodiment of those progressive ideas, the end goal isn't a Yang presidency but rather Yang's policies being adopted by the Democratic party and subsequently passed into law.</TEXT>

Same with the masks. A mandate creates the expectation that masks are to be worn, and it evens the playing field for businesses who may otherwise have been reluctant to ask their customers to wear masks lest they lose business to a less responsible shop down the street. The simple fact of seeing that 95% of the people around you are wearing masks is a huge mental shift and creates pressure in itself, compared to seeing 5% of the people around you wearing masks.

    <TEXT> #8203;  gt; Nevertheless, don't take this article as a 'don't vote for Biden' - it is far from it. For every downside to Biden, there are ten downsides to Trump. That being said, there is no reason for the Democratic party not to express regret. No one took the 'Yang Gang' seriously enough for whatever reason and now it is too late. Luckily, it's been reported Biden is in close contact with former candidate Yang. With any luck, Andrew's voice will be a prominent one within a future Biden administration. I don't know if "expressing regret" is necessary, but recognizing Yang's foresight and incorporating his ideas into the platform in the future would be a reasonable thing to do.</TEXT>

You can't have a write-in campaign at this scale and expect real results. 3. How will these candidates raise enough money to compete with Biden and Trump and their hundreds of millions of dollars? 4. How will these candidates get enough media attention so that people even know they are running? We all saw how Yang was overlooked in the primaries; these candidates certainly won't meet thresholds to be invited to debate. The media will have no incentive to cover them. 5. Yang signing on to this will be the end of his political career, again as u/fryamtheiman mentions.</TEXT>

I think people are exploiting the dissatisfaction with the current nominees to launch their own agenda, or not adequately considering the consequences of this particular plan. We saw in 2016 that bad-faith actors exploited dissatisfaction with the candidates to stoke division and depress turnout, which hit the Democratic candidate disproportionately. I'm wary of the same thing happening again in 2020. I'm not saying Weinstein is acting in bad faith, but this plan has every opportunity to launch Trump back into power for another four years, despite Weinstein's assurances to the contray.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The concept of a plastic tax is quite similar to a carbon tax. With the latter, you put a price on carbon, which is intended to hit emissions-spewing utilities particularly hard. Ideally, this has a dual benefit. First, it incentivizes polluters to produce less carbon by switching to renewable sources of energy. (Since British Columbia implemented a carbon tax in 2008, regional emissions have fallen by [up to 15 percent](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/climate/publications/british-columbias-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-review-latest-grand-experiment).) Second, the tax revenue funds green energy projects or gets kicked back to local residents as a dividend.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt; These taxes target an externality, as economists call it: A carbon tax #8217;s externality is catastrophic climate change, and a plastic tax #8217;s is runaway pollution.  #8220;That is the cost society faces, #8221; says Knittel.  #8220;Layering on top a tax, in that context, makes the market work better. And so if the goal of this tax is to price the damage that plastic pollution causes, then you're making the market work more efficiently. So from that perspective, the tax is actually a *good* tax. #8221; Related to my favorite Yang policy, [Reduce Packaging Waste](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/reduce-packaging-waste/):  gt; We need to pass a national extended producer responsibility bill, or find a way to shift the costs of disposing of these materials onto the manufacturers. If they pass the cost on to the consumers, each of us can make an informed decision about whether we really want to pay for the amount of packaging that producers are currently using for their goods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Paine is unambiguous that in the state of nature  #8220;there could be no such thing as landed property originally. #8221; People in the state of nature were allowed to occupy land but they had no right to own land as their own in perpetuity. Rather,  #8220;land #8230; is the free gift of the Creator in common to the human race. #8221; The earth belongs to every person and in a #160;state of nature no one has a #160;right to claim any particular part of that divine inheritance as their own. It's a strange thing that we simply accept the notion that a plot of land can be owned. Why? Who has the right to delineate a certain space of land and declare that it belongs to them, and no one else may use it? If earlier inhabitants were evicted from the land by force, why is it not acceptable to evict the current occupants by force? (There's a relevant cartoon about this but I can't find it....)  #8203;  gt; All people have a #160;right to the earth, but since we cannot return to the days before civilization, this system of taxation was the best method of compensating people for their lost inheritance of the earth #8217;s resources. Since some form of compensation was necessary to pay those who were disinherited from the opportunity to own property, Paine believed this was not redistribution. It was giving people what they deserved. Sounds good to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This kind of hysterical rhetoric doesn't do us any favors. Andrew Yang is doing great things right now in building his coalition, getting his message out, and helping elect downticket candidates who support his agenda. If he were tapped to be Biden's VP, he would have to put all of that on the backburner and embrace/promote Biden above all else for the next four years. Instead of agitating for something that has a near-zero chance of happening, why not turn that energy toward helping get Yang's message out? Speak to your family and friends about UBI; attend local political meetings and town halls with elected representatives and ask them about UBI/automation or other Yang policies; become active with your local Democratic/GOP group and work to shift the conversation in Yang's direction; donate to Humanity Forward and volunteer for their initiatives.

    <TEXT>I guess we'd have to know Batman's actual wealth and the population of Gotham City before we go making statements like this. Say 2 million people \* $1000/month = $24 billion a year? Is that right? How long could one billionaire sustain a UBI program? Leaving aside the fact that many of the people Batman ends up fighting are mentally unsound, so would he also have to fund mental health programs? Would that be covered by universal healthcare? I get that it's a joke, but these are incredibly complex issues that need far more thought and care than a throwaway insult can provide. Which is why Yang was so good--every time I saw him speak to groups of people, he didn't shy away from talking about the complexities of problems instead of platitudes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not necessarily true. You can easily change your mindset from one of scarcity to one of abundance without "hard work." As the article points out: 1. Focus on what you do have. 2. Surround yourself with other people who have an abundance mindset. 3. Create win-win situations. 4. Incorporate gratitude into your daily life. 5. Train your mind to recognize possibilities. It's not "delusional" to find satisfaction ~~it~~ in what you already have, instead of always chasing more. And that's not to say that we shouldn't work to make changes that would improve our lives or the lives of others...but with a mindset of abundance the focus is on improving life for *all of us*, where a mindset of scarcity forces us into a selfish "it's me or them" mentality where everything is a zero-sum game.</TEXT>

Clearly it's naive to tell those who are struggling economically to just change their mindset. But for the many, many people who have enough--or far more than enough--and don't feel the need to adjust their outlook to one of abundance, this is a message they need to hear.

    <TEXT>Politics is about passing legislation. What is the platform of this Unity campaign? I want to see UBI. I want to see universal healthcare. I want to see carbon pricing, and women's healthcare guaranteed. I want to see worker protections and paid leave. How will this plan get those policies, and all of Yang's other progressive ideas, passed into law? This plan will appeal to the small minority who are so upset that their candidate didn't get the nomination that they'd rather sit out than vote for one of the other people. It will not appeal to those who are happy with the platform of either party, or happy with the candidates. The majority of Democrats are perfectly happy with Biden, and the majority of GOP voters are perfectly happy with Trump. This isn't going to tempt them. Show us legitimate polling--from a reputable pollster--indicating that a significant number of Americans would sign on to this plan and be willing to write in Andrew Yang--someone whom many of them have likely never heard of, or never given a second thought to--instead of the man who was chosen by primary voters to be at the top of the ticket. Show us that Yang breaking is word to campaign for and work to elect Biden would not irreparably harm his political future. Until we have the data, this is nothing more than virtue-signalling people's frustration that their guy didn't win the primary. Until we have the data, I'm going to stick with Biden, as Yang is doing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yang is being heard, and making inroads within the Democratic party. Several Democratic candidates have campaigned on, and won their primaries on, a platform that includes UBI. Many standard Democratic policies are aligned with those of Yang, and would support workers (increasing the minimum wage, universal healthcare). Keep in mind the Democratic House passed their bill extending unemployment benefits at the beginning of July. The GOP-controlled Senate, on the other hand, could not get their act together on a bill until recently, and even then they porked it up with favors to Trump unrelated to relief for American workers. That's not to say that the Democratic party doesn't have problems. It is still too beholden to big business and too cautious to unabashedly embrace more extreme progressive measures. But one party wants to build things. One party wants to tear things down. It is immeasurably more difficult to build things than it is to tear them down. Don't cast equal blame on those who are unable to construct something useful when half the country keeps electing those who methodically knock the pieces down as they are being built.</TEXT>

As always, he is ahead of the game. From the article:  gt;On Jan. 1, 2023, the European Union will impose a carbon tax border adjustment. This is a levy on goods entering the EU in an amount equal to their carbon price. This ensures they remain competitive as their carbon-intensive industries become more expensive.  gt;  gt;Here in the United States, that means we will pay into their coffers to sell them carbon-intensive goods. We #8217;ll either lose European markets or lose money in them.  gt;  gt;How do we avoid this fate?

    <TEXT>An interesting read throughout, but with a nice mention of Yang towards the end:  gt;Andrew Yang, during his perfectly great presidential run, was probably not ever going to be nominated for the presidency, but to get the conversation going, not only about universal basic income, but about how A.I. and automation are going to continue eliminating jobs. They just are, and this is different than the other industrial revolutions, and there are not going to be enough jobs that it makes economic sense for people to do. Period, end of story. How are we going to deal with that? So the fact that that was not regarded as crazy and that people, Republicans as well as Democrats, in polling said,  #8220;Yeah, universal basic income sometime might be necessary. #8221; Fantastic that that is now legitimately on the table.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yang has far more opportunity to become a national figure within the Democratic party than he does with a third party (certainly better than the Green Party has been able to do in a few decades) or on his own as an internet personality. Yang is developing a wide-ranging network that includes the Democratic establishment. He clearly believes that his future career lies within the Democratic party, and it would be counterproductive for us to continually try to separate him from the party. Although it's disappointing that he has not been immediately embraced, we need to remember that he is a relative nobody, with no experience or history in elected office. He's not an extraordinary and passionate speaker; the convention is about drama and spectacle. It's not a place where Yang would shine.</TEXT>

Many incumbents--including those Yang endorsed against--have devoted far more of their lives to the DNC and its causes than Yang has. Yang has made it clear that he is not all-in for the DNC with these endorsements, and there's nothing wrong with that. And there's nothing wrong with the DNC not going out of its way to accommodate someone with an incredibly small but devoted online fanbase who doesn't reliably turn up at the polls. It's to their detriment, certainly, not amplifying Yang's message. And that's how we should play this: the DNC is missing out on leading the country into the future by passing over Yang for a speaking slot.

They want to maintain women's access to healthcare. They want to fund our teachers and our schools. If you want the DNC to pursue a more radical agenda, give them a chance. They currently have no reason to think America wants a radical agenda when every 2 years any progress they make is immediately undone when voters return a GOP majority to Congress.

    <TEXT>It's true that Yang inspired a devoted following online, and many people volunteered their time and money to help him. But the same can be said for many of the other candidates, even if we didn't see it. In my own small circle probably half a dozen folks volunteered for Buttigieg and were rabid in their support of him. And it's true that Yang's innovative policy proposal is gaining traction--but that's not Biden's policy. This is a convention to launch Biden into the White House. Until Biden embraces UBI, there would be no reason for Yang to speak about it at the convention. He would need to spend his time building up Biden--and if he did that, I suspect people here would be unhappy about that as well.  #8203;  gt; To then state that he somehow needs to serve the democratic committee rather than the democrat citizens before he is able to speak is a terrible standard to set forth. It's the DNC's party. They are well within their rights to include only speakers who will enhance Biden's candidacy and not distract from it. The Democratic voters chose Biden as their candidate, not Yang.</TEXT>

I'm not particularly interested in seeing Yang talk up Joe Biden and the DNC's current platform (which is what he would be limited to doing, on the convention stage) instead of whole-heartedly promoting his own platform.  #8203;  gt; What progress has Yang made in the DNC? He is making alliances and learning how the system works. He has a national platform on CNN as a Democratic voice. He is building credibility and trying to move from being an outsider to a position of influence. That doesn't happen overnight, or in the space of 6 months. I could just as easily ask, what Yang has done for the DNC, to rate one of those coveted speaking slots as a representative of the party? Is he an eloquent and passionate speaker, like Obama? Is he a Biden surrogate? Has he raised substantial amounts of money for Democratic candidates? Has he won high elected office? How many new voters did he bring to the Democratic party--not to Yang, but to the party? Is it a missed opportunity, passing over Yang to speak? Absolutely. They need his innovative solutions and would do well to model their rhetoric after him.

But he's the candidate we have, and his party is aligned with the direction I want the country to move. I caucused for Sanders in 2016. I voted for Clinton in the general. I don't doubt that the DNC preferred Clinton to Sanders, but I also don't fault them for preferring a Democrat as their candidate instead of someone who only decides to become a Democrat every 4 years when he wants to coattail onto their power structure to run for president. I went through my anti-establishment phase, explored other parties and other options. But it always comes back to who has the organization and structure to actually make policy. And, for better or for worse, it's the DNC. It's more productive to elect Justice Democrats and other progressives within the system to pull it left than it is to demonize a very powerful organization and treat them as an enemy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whatever you might think about the DNC, the fact that they were so responsive shows that Yang has a place with them, and his views (and his supporters) are important to them. I'm not going to hold my breath that he will be able to speak at length about UBI or his other more innovative ideas, but anything that gets his face and words in front of America is going to do good things for him and his future. It will be tricky to come up with a memorable speech for such a precise purpose, but I have no doubt he's up to the challenge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only [22% of American adults are on twitter](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/), and those who are skew younger. So although trending hashtags may make a difference *among twitter users*, they are next to meaningless to the majority of Americans who don't spend time there--particularly older Americans. Again, we fall into the perennial trap of mistaking online activity for real life. More exposure to a fifth of Americans--particularly a demographic that is not known for reliably turning out to vote--is nice, but it's not the massive game-changer that it is sometimes imagined to be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are *dozens* of people who did not get a speaking slot initially, from establishment stalwarts to other primary candidates to people with cross-party appeal. It was not a singular, pointed snub at Yang. Yes, they would have been wise to include him in the first place. Yes, his ideas are the way the party should be moving in the future. But it's pointless to stew in resentment instead of seeing this as the opportunity that it is. People are looking for leaders and solutions, not grudge-holders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Reaching out to 11% of adults or 22% is a huge difference. Only if they vote. The primaries showed that they did not, at least not in numbers to make a difference. Obviously getting Yang's message out any way we can is a good thing. But we have a tendency to focus on twitter to the exclusion of all other platforms, despite the fact that the twitter demographic is already fairly receptive to his ideas. We need to do a better job of reaching the Fox News/MSNBC crowds; the NPR crowds; the Facebook boomers. Those are the people who drive their local party politics, and those are the people who vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I take the statement about leading based on facts to be in opposition to leading based on ideology. Most politicians currently start with their ideology and only entertain "facts" that support that ideology. Yang is the reverse, in that he starts with "facts" regardless of ideology. Data is still open to interpretation to some extent, is it not? Lies, damned lies, and statistics, etc. It can be parsed and explained in different ways, to suit different agendas. It can be poorly collected data, or data collected to advance a particular argument. There is a flood of "data" about the pandemic, as an example. People looking at different numbers and pointing to charts that back their ideology while disregarding those that don't. We still need to come to some sort of "truth" or "fact" based on the data.</TEXT>

No longer will the question  #8220;What will I be? #8221; get fully answered by  #8220;What job shall I have? #8221; The job will no longer be the whole measure of one #8217;s identity, one #8217;s status, one #8217;s finances or one #8217;s purpose. This may be the opportunity for a wider vision of humanity and of life.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt; If we cannot give everyone a job for the whole of their lives, would it be preferable to give everyone a job for part of their lives? Or to give some a job for all of their lives and to others none? What would this mean in practice? It might be that we start work later and end it earlier in our lives. Or would it mean more sabbaticals and longer holidays? Or shorter weeks and more part-time work? If so, what would happen to our earnings? If we could maintain the same productivity with fewer years or fewer hours, there would be no need for new jobs. Would we be prepared to accept less money for less work?  #8203; Although I'm not sure how much stock to put in an article that references " father of modern capitalism, John Maynard **Keys**"....still an interesting read.</TEXT>

There is no "level playing field" when industry is allowed to damage our world without shouldering the costs, and instead leaving taxpayers to clean up their mess.

The fact that other states lack the political will to enact their own bottle bill is not a reflection on its success but rather an admission that those states are fine with the additional litter and forcing municipalities to shoulder the burden instead of the industry that profits off their sales. If you really spend literally *hours* and *gallons* of water rinsing and returning your cans and bottles every year, you must consume an extraordinary amount of those beverages, in which case cutting down might not be a bad idea. Or perhaps you are exaggerating to try to make your point stronger.

    <TEXT>UBI would be irrelevant if you had to pay everything into private insurance to make sure you won't be ruined by a bad diagnosis. Most people currently rely on their employers for health insurance; if UBI is meant to mitigate the problems that will come with mass unemployment, how will all those unemployed people get healthcare when they no longer have an employer to subsidize the insurance? The so-called free market will not accommodate people with chronic disease who are unemployed and living off $1000 a month. Yang on the cost of universal healthcare:  gt; We talk about how we #8217;re going to pay for it, but the reality is we #8217;re already paying for it. We pay for it when we can #8217;t switch jobs. We pay for it when new jobs are temp or gig jobs that don #8217;t provide healthcare. We pay for it when all of our prices are higher. We pay for it when healthcare costs drive us into bankruptcy.

Line up her [Environment policy](https://jo20.com/issues/environment/), for example, with [Yang's](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/climate-change/). She doesn't even mention climate change, the issue that Yang ranks as 1a in importance after automation. It would be funny if the stakes weren't so high.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The costs will be offloaded to consumers That's exactly the point. When the actual costs of something are included in the price, consumers are able to make informed decisions. For a simplified example, say you can buy something that comes packaged in standard plastic, or a biodegradable plastic. Right now, the biodegradable plastic option likely costs more because the costs of disposing of it are already included. But if we internalize the costs to dispose of the standard plastic--if the costs to recycle that plastic were included in the up-front price instead of offloaded to municipal recycling streams--the price difference between the two plastics would be much smaller. People would be more likely to opt for the biodegradable packaging instead of the standard plastic. That cost has been successfully internalized.</TEXT>

Internalizing the costs shifts that burden to the people who choose to buy the harmful product instead of forcing everyone to pay it. If a gallon of gas actually included the cost of the damage it causes to our climate and environment, that cost would fall more on people who choose less efficient vehicles. People would buy more efficient vehicles, and manufacturers would be expected to produce more efficient vehicles. The market would actually work better, because the real costs of a product would be included in the price.</TEXT>

They talk about lowering taxes as getting money into the hands of the American people--that is overwhelmingly a benefit to the wealthy, not those who are hurting the most.

    <TEXT>It's good to see UBI gaining traction as a legitimate policy idea in very left-leaning media, with acknowledgements of Yang's arguments in favor of UBI. From the article, a concise argument for the necessity of UBI:  gt; The premise of UBI is logical enough, perhaps more sensible in this political moment: #160;Why should one's #160;livelihood #160;be jeopardized due to economic #160;factors or disasters #160;beyond their control? If something like a [pandemic](https://www.salon.com/2020/06/07/the-coronavirus-next-victim-capitalism/) #160;or a [Wall Street meltdown](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/17/how-the-iraq-war-and-the-great-recession-of-2008-paved-the-way-for-the-trump-catastrophe/) #160;can destroy innocent lives, shouldn't the government install a program that will protect them?

    <TEXT>I utterly disagree with this article but it's important to see the counterarguments being framed around UBI. Many of them are standard objections we've seen before, based on puritanical ideas of "work" and conflating "work" with "providing value for your employer":  #8203;  gt;A guaranteed income would be corrosive to people #8217;s work ethic, especially as politicians raised the benefits whenever elections rolled around. It would eat away at the crucial link between effort and reward and would lure many people away from pursuing more productive lives. This is wrong, morally and economically. #160;  gt;  gt; Work is critical to making our lives meaningful. It gives us purpose. It provides structure and encourages discipline, helping us to look beyond the immediate moment and think about the future. It encourages the can-do spirit that is unique to the American culture. Work produces the resources that we consume and the innovations that improve our standard of living. #160; If anything is "corrosive", it's the idea that a person's worth is only the value they bring to the economy. This is going to require a drastic shift in the public perception to a Humanity First mindset where people understand the economy serves us, not the other way around.</TEXT>

[Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1#_blank) over the past six months remained far above what we could have achieved even a decade ago. Investors have driven key stock indexes [back above](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) their February peaks. But rarely have such economic indicators been so entirely beside the point. Seriously: Who cares?  gt;  gt;What good does G.D.P. do, if people we love are falling seriously ill and dying in unprecedented numbers; if the rhythms of daily life vital to our happiness have gone haywire and our social connections have atrophied?  gt;  gt;Typically shielded from such problems, the country #8217;s professional class now finds itself experiencing a taste of the insecurity and anxiety that the working class has felt for decades: The dissolution of community; the suddenly prohibitive distances separating friends and family; the anger at experts selling ineffective, poorly planned schooling as adequate to their children #8217;s needs.  gt;  gt;The calamity we're now all living through offers the professional class an opportunity to reconsider assessments of the national condition issued so confidently pre-pandemic: Economists focus on material living standards partly for ease of quantification, but also because that is what free markets most reliably produce. And for many on the right-of-center especially, a rise in living standards equals success, which conveniently supports the conclusion that the economy has been delivering well.

So  #8220;when Joe decides to embrace or champion a position, he drags the entire center with him. #8221;  gt;  gt;Yang said he thinks any policy rifts between centrists and progressives are  #8220;overblown. #8221; The multiple crises facing the country, he said, will make big policy prescriptions  #8220;reasonable #8221; when in the past they would have been  #8220;unrealistic. #8221; Yang himself did an amazing job making very progressive policies palatable to conservatives and libertarians.

    <TEXT>Related to my favorite Yang policy, [Reduce Packaging Waste](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/reduce-packaging-waste/). From the article:  gt; For years, the plastics industry has tried to convince us that its products were necessary, touting convenience and cleanliness. They told us that if we just recycle and participate in cleanups, we can tackle the pollution crisis. Decades later, we know that has not worked. Only 9 percent of all the plastic ever made has actually been recycled, and we are drowning in this indestructible material. Further, [the recycling industry has all but collapsed](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/china-has-stopped-accepting-our-trash/584131/). We cannot recycle our way out of the plastic epidemic. The plastic industry continues to mislead the public about the overall benefits of plastic  #8212; and it is time for us to stop listening.  gt;  gt; While certain applications of plastic must continue for medical and safety reasons, we should phase it out wherever possible to avoid its long-term impacts to our health and the environment. We do not need single-use plastic bags, packaging, utensils or cups. The general public does not need single-use masks or gloves during the pandemic. The plastics industry needs to internalize the costs of collecting, recycling, and disposing of their products within the cost, instead of offloading responsibility to municipal waste streams. Yang is the only candidate I've heard try to explain the complex problem of negative externalities like this, and the need to internalize them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm voting for Biden because his policies, and the Democratic platform, are more closely aligned with my values than those of the GOP (who, it must be pointed out, did not even bother to assemble a platform for 2020). I'm particularly concerned with climate change and negative externalities. Yang considered climate change issue 1a after automation/UBI, and his emphasis on a carbon fee + dividend was something I thought would be a necessary policy to implement. Biden and the Democrats acknowledge climate change and are interested in taking steps to mitigate its effects. The GOP has done nothing, and continues to double down on 19th-century energy sources for political reasons. They have nothing to offer me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; is there actually anyone really excited for Biden Every Democrat I know is excited to vote for Biden. They understand that politics isn't about pouting when your "soulmate" candidate doesn't get the nomination, but rather about putting people into office who will move the country in the direction you think is best.  gt; neither of them have so far This is utterly and demonstrably false. Just look at all the [policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/climate/climate-rule-trump-reversing.html) and [initiatives](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/10/trump-obama-climate-clean-energy-243655) from the Obama administration that Trump has been methodically reversing. This obviously untrue whataboutism calls into question whether you are actually here to discuss in good faith.  gt; But aren't emmisions lower under trump? The Trump administration deserves no credit for the [slight drop](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fell-slightly-in-2019/2020/01/06/568f0a82-309e-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html), which was due to declines in demand rather than any GOP policy initiatives. Emissions need to drop faster, and we need leaders who will implement policies to do so, instead of obstructing and putting corporate profits over everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's go back to your original claim that neither side has done or will do anything about climate change. In the articles I linked, they describe Obama policies and initiatives to: * Reduce methane leaks * Improve fuel efficiency standards for vehicles * Regulate CO2 emissions from coal plants * Prevent drilling on public lands and shores And Trump efforts to reverse or undermine them. So no, you are incorrect when you try to claim that neither side is doing or will do anything about climate change. One side is actively trying to do something to improve the situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[This article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/) provides context and detail about the rate of decline for which you'd like to give credit to Trump. Relevant excerpts:  gt; In other words, emissions declined under Trump, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the late Obama era.  #8203;  gt; the annual decline slowed on Trump #8217;s watch in the EIA data, too. In 2017, when Trump was president, emissions fell by less than 1 percent. That was a smaller decrease than for either of Obama #8217;s final two years. In 2016, emissions fell by 1.64 percent from their 2015 level, and for 2015, they fell by 2.68 percent over their 2014 level.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt; "Most variations in emissions are due to the combination of long-term trends in energy use and efficiency and short-term variations in weather, with exceptional winter cold or summer heat leading to increased energy use and resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions," said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A amp;M University atmospheric sciences professor.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt;Whatever decline has occurred on Trump #8217;s watch is unlikely to stem from his own policies. Changes to emissions levels tend to come either from changing economic incentives, government policy over the long term, and factors beyond human control, such as the weather. I am clearly putting in more time debunking your false claims than you are in making them, so next time please include some legitimate resources to back up your assertions.</TEXT>

People have been sitting out elections in protest or voting third party for as long as I can remember, starting with Perot in '92 (and longer than that, I'm sure), and it has never had an effect that was satisfactory to those who chose that route. Like Yang, I think that Biden and the Democrats will move the country closer to where I want it to go than the alternative. Most of Yang's policies that I believe in already have a place in the Democratic platform, so it seems silly to virtue-signal my loyalty to Yang by casting a vote that would make it more likely for Trump to return to office and Yang's policies to be pushed off the table permanently by 4 more years of hard-right ideologues installed in our courts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sharing this article here as it demonstrates the necessity of Yang's take on healthcare as being preventive rather than reactionary. Americans in general are not healthy, and our lifestyle doesn't make it easy to make healthy choices. From the article:  gt; Eight months into the pandemic, obesity has turned out to be one of the clearest predictors of a difficult battle against covid-19, for reasons that may vary from person to person. Some experts say they consider obesity to have contributed to the stunning coronavirus death and morbidity rate in the United States, which has one of the highest obesity rates in the world. And there is some evidence it is particularly harmful for people under 60, who generally fare better than the elderly against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. From Yang's [Preventive Care and Food Security](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/preventative-care-and-food-security/) policy:  gt; In addition to more preventative healthcare, it is essential that we recognize the impact of factors outside the clinic or hospital that contribute to health outcomes. We must teach healthy habits to young people and children. Eating an apple a day may not keep the doctor away, but it does promote healthy eating. Teaching kids the basics of a nutritious diet (and providing them healthy meals at school) and providing early screenings to identify flags like behavioral issues and different types of disabilities are key pieces in building towards positive outcomes. Tackling these issues early gives kids the best shot at leading a healthy life.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt; As President I will...  gt;  gt;\- Encourage doctors to educate their patients about the importance of diet, nutrition, and physical activity on overall health.  gt;  gt;\- Incentivize integrated preventative care and healthy activities, like gym memberships, biking to work, and consuming fresh produce.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The parties weren't always so rigidly separated, and could often come together to agree on legislation that was a compromise to the greater benefit of the American people. Starting in the 90s, along with hyper-partisan media networks, there developed an entrenched system whose primary goal was not passing legislation but rather treating the other party as an "enemy" to be defeated at all costs. We need to get away from the hyperpartisanship and team-sport mentality. Yang's democracy plan will go a long way to helping that, particularly eliminating gerrymandering and enacting ranked-choice (or another non-FPTP) voting.</TEXT>

If they have another 4 years, they are going to get it that much further away from Yang's ideal, and it will take that much longer to get it back on course. Yang doesn't want to give them that time.

    <TEXT>Excerpt from the article:  gt; Jobs and G.D.P., by contrast, sort of are the economy. But they aren #8217;t the economy #8217;s point. What some economists and many politicians often forget is that economics isn #8217;t fundamentally about data, it #8217;s about people. I like data as much as, or probably more than, the next guy. But an economy #8217;s success should be judged not by impersonal statistics, but by whether people #8217;s lives are getting better.  gt;  gt;And the simple fact is that over the past few weeks the lives of many Americans have gotten much worse.  gt;  gt;....  gt;  gt; The CARES Act, enacted in March, gave the unemployed an extra $600 a week in benefits. This supplement played a crucial role in limiting extreme hardship; poverty may even have [gone down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty.html).  gt;  gt;But the supplement ended on July 31, and all indications are that Republicans in the Senate will do nothing to restore aid before the election. President Trump #8217;s attempt to implement a $300 per week supplement by executive action will fail to reach many and prove inadequate even for those who get it. Families may have scraped by for a few weeks on saved money, but things are about to get very hard for millions.  gt;  gt;The bottom line here is that before you cite economic statistics, you want to think about what they mean for people and their lives. The data aren #8217;t meaningless: A million jobs gained is better than a million jobs lost, and growing G.D.P. is better than shrinking G.D.P. But there is often a disconnect between the headline numbers and the reality of American life, and that is especially true right now.  gt;  gt;The fact is that this economy just isn #8217;t working for many Americans, who are facing hard times that  #8212; thanks to political decisions by Trump and his allies  #8212; are just getting harder.</TEXT>

UBI, automation, carbon fee + dividend, universal healthcare, human-centered capitalism. Those are all things that everyone, in every country should be able to get on board with.

    <TEXT>Thanks. I'm still stuck on this statement from your OP, which seems to be the crux of your argument against taking action to mitigate the effects of the virus:  gt;We know that the vast majority of people that have died with Covid-19 were elderly and sick and that they probably would have died from something else within a few years if Covid hadn #8217;t hit. Do we know that? How do we know that? How many years might those people have had with their families if our leaders had handled the pandemic better? Do you think their families would agree with your assessment of their loved ones' lives' relative worth in comparison to a hypothetical economic future for young people that may or may not be headed into the toilet regardless of covid? I can completely agree about the equity issue regarding schools opening, and the problem that many working parents face when they have to find alternative daytime care for children who cannot attend school. But I disagree that wanting safe outcomes for most people is demonstrative of a problem specific to "the left" but rather an indictment of the extraordinarily poor handling of the epidemic on a national level right from the beginning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Excerpt:  gt;We could start by making corporations like #160;[Netflix and Amazon pay more than zero dollars in federal income taxes](https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/you-paid-taxes-these-corporations-didnt/) (neither company paid such taxes in 2018, according to the Center for Public Integrity), and using some of that money to incentivize small-business creation and development. Or we could use that income to fund a universal basic income, which would give consumers additional funds to patronize their favorite small businesses. We saw how effective this could be when the federal government approved the $1,200 stimulus for all Americans and $600 in additional unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs. Spending picked up temporarily, but now that the stimulus money is gone, spending has slowed again.</TEXT>

And every election the young people stay home. It happened with Yang in the primaries, and it happens every 2/4 years. Vote. Get your friends to vote.  #8203; Edit: moving the numbers from a lower comment here. In Mitch McConnell's last election (2014), there were 3,158,965 registered voters. The results were 806,787 McConnell and 584,698 for his opponent Grimes. That means **1,767,480** eligible voters didn't bother to vote at all. More than half of registered voters didn't vote. We can't say the problem is Congress alone when half the voters can't even be bothered to cast a ballot. The entire set of non-voters could have turned up and voted for someone entirely different in 2014 and we wouldn't be in this mess. Vote.</TEXT>

Look at the 20th century, when [one party controlled all of Congress for decades at a time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divided_government_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Combined--Control_of_the_U.S._House_of_Representatives_-_Control_of_the_U.S._Senate.png). Look at the drastic reforms and sweeping legislation that was passed. That won't happen if, every time they try to pass a milquetoast bit of reform like the ACA, they are rewarded with the loss of their majority. Every time. So they think there is no hunger for even more progressive reform in the US, because every time they try to take a tiny step towards progress, voters shove them back in the opposite direction.</TEXT>

That means **1,767,480** eligible voters didn't bother to vote at all. More than half of registered voters didn't vote. So your argument seems to be supporting mine, that people need to VOTE if they want better representation. You mention gerrymandering, which is not relevant in a Senate election. Again, your comment seems uniquely intended to make Americans doubt and distrust our system of democracy, reminiscent of bad-faith actors doing the same in 2016 in an effort to depress voter turnout and hand the election to Trump. We don't need a replay of that.</TEXT>

It's not surprising that the people who actually turn up and make an effort are the ones making the decisions.

    <TEXT>Biden's [government reform plans](https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/) include both campaign finance reform and lobbying reforms. From the link: * **Introduce a constitutional amendment to entirely eliminate private dollars from our federal elections.** Biden believes it is long past time to end the influence of private dollars in our federal elections. As president, Biden will fight for a constitutional amendment that will require candidates for federal office to solely fund their campaigns with public dollars, and prevent outside spending from distorting the election process. This amendment will do far more than just overturn *Citizens United*: #160; it will return our democracy to the people and away from the corporate interests that seek to distort it. #160; #160; * **Enact legislation to provide voluntary matching public funds for federal candidates receiving small dollar donations.** While we work toward a constitutional amendment, meaningful change can be made by legislation. Biden will propose legislation to provide public matching funds for small dollar donations to all federal candidates. This will especially help first-time candidates access the resources needed to compete, freeing them to focus on interacting with voters, not high-dollar donors. #160; .... * **Increase transparency of election spending.**  #160;Our campaign finance law is outdated, and Biden will update it to reflect the modern era. Too often, candidates and their allies now use online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to spread misleading or outright false ads that are micro-targeted to certain populations and unrecognized by the press. Biden will propose legislation codifying what should be a simple tenet of campaign finance law: any group that advocates for or against candidates for federal office in its ads or communications must disclose its contributors. #160; No more hiding behind  #8220;dark money #8221; groups to spread lies. This law will require all online ads, how they #8217;re targeted, and who paid for them to be posted by the groups to a public database on a new one-stop website, ethics.gov  #8212; so no one can target voters with misinformation without attracting media or political attention. #160; #160; * **End dark money groups.** Federal law recognizes  #8220;social welfare #8221; groups, also known as 501(c)(4)s, which were intended to advocate for specific causes. But after *Citizens United*, they #8217;ve increasingly been used as dark money groups  #8212; spending hundreds of millions of dollars on federal and state elections without disclosing their donors. Biden will enact legislation to bar 501(c)(4)s from spending in elections  #8211; the same bar that applies to Section 501(c)(3) charitable groups. He #8217;ll also lead reform of the Federal Election Campaign Act, to ensure that any entity of any kind that spends more than $10,000 on federal elections must register with the Commission on Federal Ethics and publicly disclose its donors. #160; #160; .... * **Ban corporate PAC contributions to candidates, and prohibit lobbyist contributions to those who they lobby**. Biden will ensure that lobbyists and corporate PACs do not play a role in our elections. Biden #8217;s presidential campaign is refusing any funding from lobbyists and corporate PACs. As president, he #8217;ll enact legislation to bar lobbyists from making contributions to, and fundraising or bundling for, those who they lobby. This legislation will be designed to ensure that the public knows as much as possible about the political spending of those who seek to influence officeholders and other government officials. #160; Any lobbyist contribution must be disclosed within 24-hours, and any lobbyist-hosted fundraising event must be disclosed before it occurs. #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Assuming there is a legitimate question in this, the census helps to allocate congressional representatives as well as determine populations in different areas for funding and other distribution of resources. As a completely overblown example based on numbers I am making up (but you'll get the idea), if only 50% of Iowans completed the census, but 100% of Nebraskans did, there's a possibility that we would lose one of our congressional representatives and Nebraska would gain one, because the census is what determines that allocation. Edit: instead of ranting about the census, which is an important tool for gathering data (and data is what we need to make informed decisions), why not get involved with organizing to elect people to office that you think will perform better than the current elected officials? We have an opportunity to change the composition of our state legislators every couple of years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the article:  gt;Notably, it isn #8217;t just those in the middle who #8217;ve been hit. RAND found that full-time, prime-age workers in the 25th percentile of the U.S. income distribution would be making $61,000 instead of $33,000 had everyone #8217;s earnings from 1975 to 2018 expanded roughly in line with gross domestic product, as they did during the 1950s and  #8217;60s.  gt;  gt;Workers in the 75th percentile would be at $126,000 instead of $81,000. Remarkably, even those in the 90th percentile would be better off than they are now if economic growth had been shared as it was in the post-war era. They #8217;d be making $168,000 rather than $133,000.  gt;  gt;Tally it all up, according to RAND, and the bottom 90% of American workers would be bringing home an additional $2.5 trillion in total annual income if economic gains were as equitably divided as they #8217;d been in the past #8212;leading Rolf to dub the phenomenon  #8220;the $2.5 trillion theft. #8221; As Warren Buffet said, " **There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning."**  #8203;  gt;They say the blame lies, in large measure, with decades of failed federal policy decisions #8212;allowing the minimum wage [to deteriorate](https://equitablegrowth.org/rebuilding-u-s-labor-market-wage-standards/), overtime coverage [to dwindle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/24/do-you-make-under-year-heres-why-you-may-be-owed-mandatory-overtime-pay-soon/), and the effectiveness of labor law [to decline](https://harvardmagazine.com/podcast/2020/benjamin-sachs-and-sharon-block), undermining union power. They also cite a shift in corporate culture that has elevated the [interests of shareholders](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/2020/08/19/shareholders-first-what-hasnt-changed-since-the-business-roundtables-2019-statement/) over those of workers, an ethos that took root [50 years ago this week](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes.com_2020_09_11_business_dealbook_milton-2Dfriedman-2Ddoctrine-2Dsocial-2Dresponsibility-2Dof-2Dbusiness.html amp;d=DwMFaQ amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM amp;r=-46hOwN7YoGN9nlqvpoV3TjkulkLJEIl4KVLakOxLJU amp;m=NJeZ2hgX3ViH2HLu6JkkLquy0sNtUuPdIk7mMaGQivY amp;s=2TcaEttEjpacD3xejE3VWBFaxRLzNGOx7oWcLRHnDW8 amp;e=) with the publication of an essay by University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman.  gt;  gt;Many of these developments, Rolf points out, have been driven by the belief that an unfettered free market would generate wealth for everyone. Thanks to the RAND study, he says,  #8220;we now have the proof that this theory was wrong. #8221; The myth of the "free market" is over.

    <TEXT>There is a vast difference between these emergency proposals and a real UBI. Nobody thinks these short-term, unfunded stimulus packages are a great idea. They are simply better than the alternative (doing nothing), in order to stave off an even worse situation. Nobody in Congress want to manufacture trillions of dollars, but they recognize that something is needed to keep our economy afloat during this crisis. A UBI like the Freedom Dividend, on the other hand, would need to be long-term, *funded*, and sustainable. It would require implementing a number of new taxes and programs to fund it, primarily a significant VAT but also including a carbon fee, increasing capital gains taxes, and implementing a financial transaction tax. Enacting any new tax is going to be a significant lift, but it can be done if the will is there (and if we stop electing people who sign on to the simplistic and childish idea of all taxation being "theft"). All that is to say, this is like comparing going into debt to pay for a kid's emergency surgery with going into debt to pay for a kid's college. One is an unplanned disaster that absolutely must be addressed immediately; the other is a longer-term need that can be better managed with proper planning.</TEXT>

As you note, Yang didn't call out either party in his post, but you introduced an anti-Democratic slant to it--presumably to promote your own agenda. I know this sub skews young, but people need to understand that others have different experiences and values, and reach different conclusions about the world based on that. It doesn't make them shills. It makes them people who have different opinions than you. Look. I've been hearing people declare that the two parties are useless and corrupt for twenty years now. I considered voting Stein in 2016. I may have voted Nader in 2000 (who the hell remembers at this point). But the fact is, all the real change that has been enacted in the past century has come when one party had a mandate and governed for a decade and more, allowing them to push further and further without being jerked back every two years by losing power. You had to go back 150+ years to name a third-party candidate that achieved power. There is not currently a single third party that has to potential to harvest any more than a small portion of disgruntled individuals. Talk to us when they start getting majorities in some local and state houses, or even more than a token individual elected anywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yang did amazingly well considering he was an unknown with zero political experience whose entire campaign was based on a fairly extreme and not-well-understood idea. By all rights, his campaign should have fizzled and passed quietly into the night, never to be heard from again. And that's not due to any rigging, or DNC shenanigans, that's just the odds that were against him from the get-go. The fact that we are still talking about him--that he has a voice on CNN--that he has a successful nonprofit--that he has the ear of Democratic leadership--is due to the power of his message. Not only that, but his own extraordinary hard work, and the work of his online supporters to try to get his message into the conversation. It's completely unrealistic to think that, with zero name recognition and zero experience, Yang would have come from nowhere to win the presidency. We should be celebrating that he has come so far, and continue working to move to the next stage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Found this article to be a little insufferable, but the idea is something to be aware of as it tries to supplant Yang's Freedom Dividend and other UBI proposals with a "Social Security for All." Its characterization of UBI is a combination of scare tactics and misinformation (emphasis added):  gt; Conservative supporters, like **racist** *Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, see it as the way to demolish what remains of the welfare state. He would replace *all* the current cash assistance programs with a single UBI payment. And therein lies the UBI dilemma. As *The Atlantic* #8217;s Annie Lowrey points out,  #8220;UBI is an ethos as much as it is a technocratic policy proposal. #8221; Some of the actual proposals, like Yang #8217;s and Murray #8217;s, would cut anti-poverty programs so much that many **poor people would be worse off than they were before** UBI. Indeed, UBI could be and is often **designed as a form of redistribution** ***from*** **the poor to the middle class and wealthy**. And because the $1,000-per-month proposal costs so much #8212;nearly $4 trillion per year #8212;it can be a vehicle for conservatives to launch yet another assault on the size and scope of government.  #8203; And its plan to fund "Social Security for All" is more of the same (although I agree that "the wealthy" need to return to contributing a larger share to the ongoing well-being of our country, they need to throw out some real numbers to show it is feasible):  gt; The financing would target the outsize gains of the super-rich over the past 50 years. The range of potential funding pools is vast: a wealth tax, higher corporate taxes, a financial-transaction tax, increased income taxes for high earners, or increasing taxes on unearned income to the levels the nation had during Dwight Eisenhower #8217;s presidency. A substantial wealth tax #8212;an idea that seemed radical just a few years ago #8212;is supported by three-quarters of registered voters and among people of all ages and races and from both political parties.  #8203; So clearly the idea of permanent, universal cash payments to all Americans is attractive across the spectrum, but there will be debate on the details.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She is certainly putting her ideology ahead of reality in many cases.  gt; One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation #8217;s "crumbling road and transportation systems." Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds.  gt;  gt;"I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government," [Ernst said](http://www.iptv.org/iowapress/story.cfm/story/11721/ip_20140424_4131_ernst_cutting_spending). She called for "closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level...." Why Ed and EPA? How much of the federal budget do those agencies comprise as opposed to, say, the military? Why is an increased gas tax not on the table to pay for roads and transportation? Why rob from completely unrelated agencies?  #8203;  gt; While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. "Let #8217;s shut down the EPA," she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, "The state knows best how to protect resources." Utter nonsense. Pollution and other environmental harms don't respect state borders. Our waterways aren't confined within state borders. The nutrients Iowa dumps into our rivers find their way downstream to the Gulf. Does she think that Gulf fisherfolk should be able to sue the state of Iowa for failing to manage our pollution? Does she want states to implement carbon fees independently and then slap tariffs on imports from other states who fail to do so? It sounds like she simply doesn't have a grasp on what "environmental protection" is, if she thinks it can be parsed into 50 different compartments and have any effect whatsoever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Andrew Yang hasn't given up on it, and it's the primary reason I came to support him in early 2019. I hope he can bring Biden and others, both Democrats and Republicans, around on it. From the article, a good explanation of negative externalities and why this is a necessary, market-based solution:  gt;Although carbon dioxide itself doesn #8217;t constitute a direct health threat, fossil fuel use also releases a slurry of toxic chemicals that can lead to asthma, strokes, heart disease, and cancer. According to the World Health Organization, roughly [7 million people around the world die each year](https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/) from causes linked to air pollution.  gt;  gt;Burning fossil fuels, therefore, creates a massive cost that no one is paying for  #8212; a  #8220;negative externality #8221; in economist-speak.  #8220;Allowing people to emit CO2 into the atmosphere for free is similar to allowing people to smoke in a crowded room or dump trash into a national park, #8221; wrote the Nobel prize-winning economist William Nordhaus in 2008. Nicholas Stern, also an economist and the author of an influential 2006 report on global warming, has argued that climate change  #8220;is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen. #8221;  gt;  gt;To those who spend their days thinking about money and markets, there #8217;s a simple fix: Put a price on carbon to reflect its actual costs to the planet and human health. If fossil fuels are more expensive, the thinking goes, individuals, corporations, and governments will not only use less energy, they #8217;ll also boost wind and solar power, expand public transportation, and take other steps necessary to build a green economy.</TEXT>

Where the climate is moist and warm, it takes thousands of years to form just a few centimetres of soil.

Who would pay these costs? How much can be manufactured annually, and how many acres can be covered?). But some actual data to back that up is necessary. Edit: to save your complaint, the hundreds of years of natural processes required to create topsoil on the scale we originally enjoyed is why I described it as "irreplaceable". It's like grilling someone to explain what their childhood home was made of that can't be replaced, after you burn it down.

Morals, ethics, consequences, they play no part in his decision-making process as to who or what he supports. If they like him; Trump likes them. This is the crux of understanding Trump and who he thinks of as "good" and who is "bad". Who is an ally and who is an enemy. It's childish and stunted, but there is a simple logic to follow; I'm not sure it's accurate to label him as racist/misogynist/homophobic/xenophobic because any one of those groups would be favored if they would display suitable fealty to him.  #8203;  gt;And to think that our foreign policy, even our domestic policy, is governed by that philosophy; a philosophy that #8217;s completely unbridled by ethics or moral norms, it #8217;s downright scary and completely unamerican. But THIS is the crux of why he is such an awful and disastrous person to lead out country. He has no interest in what is good for the country if it diverges from what is good for Trump.</TEXT>

I've heard so many Democrats excuse completely writing off smaller rural districts because they don't think they have a chance to win and they want to focus their spending elsewhere. But they don't realize they are just reinforcing the alienation that these deep-red areas feel from Democrats. That's why J.D. Scholten is such a great candidate. He's been out working in the 4th district for the past 4 years, talking to people--listening to people--and letting them hear Democratic plans for making their lives better. If downticket candidates never bother to talk to them, of course they aren't going to vote for your party at the top of the ballot.</TEXT>

The [encyclical](http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html) has many points in common with Yang's view, and many more that are worth consideration regardless of one's personal beliefs:  gt; We are more alone than ever in an increasingly massified world that promotes individual interests and weakens the communitarian dimension of life. Indeed, there are markets where individuals become mere consumers or bystanders. ....  gt; Digital communication wants to bring everything out into the open; people #8217;s lives are combed over, laid bare and bandied about, often anonymously. Respect for others disintegrates, and even as we dismiss, ignore or keep others distant, we can shamelessly peer into every detail of their lives. ....  gt; In the face of many petty forms of politics focused on immediate interests, I would repeat that  #8220;true statecraft is manifest when, in difficult times, we uphold high principles and think of the long-term common good. ....  gt; When one part of society exploits all that the world has to offer, acting as if the poor did not exist, there will eventually be consequences. Sooner or later, ignoring the existence and rights of others will erupt in some form of violence, often when least expected. Liberty, equality and fraternity can remain lofty ideals unless they apply to everyone. .... And this--this is probably a step further than Yang would be willing to go but it is language that we need to be hearing:  gt; For my part, I would observe that  #8220;the Christian tradition has never recognized the right to private property as absolute or inviolable, and has stressed the social purpose of all forms of private property #8221;.[\[95\]](http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html#_ftn95) .... The right to private property can only be considered a secondary natural right, derived from the principle of the universal destination of created goods. This has concrete consequences that ought to be reflected in the workings of society. Yet it often happens that secondary rights displace primary and overriding rights, in practice making them irrelevant.</TEXT>

The voter ID on the requests is meant to verify the identity of the person making the request. It is either the 4-digit PIN or your drivers license number, either will work. But **if the auditor pre-fills this field, it completely invalidates its purpose as an identity verification**. The auditor should have considered the purpose of those fields before pre-filling them. We can disagree about whether someone should need to verify their identification before they are given a ballot. But at this point, it is part of the requirements that our state legislature has determined to be necessary. The county auditors in these counties tried to circumvent that, and the courts shot them down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A vote for Yang on the presidential ballot isn't going to do anything in a real sense. There will not be enough write-ins with his name to be more than a fine-print asterisk in only the most minutely detailed results list. No one is going to see that 347 people in New York wrote in Yang; they are going to see the numbers for the main candidates and then a lump sum of "Other". A vote for Yang will be a personally cathartic action that doesn't have any effect at all on the larger conversation. If a personal catharsis is of primary importance to you, vote for Yang. If you want to be a part of steering the conversation and moving Yang's policies closer to reality, vote for Biden to help build the anti-Trump landslide many of us are hoping to see. Personally I think that someone who votes for Biden will have a better conversational entry point with Democrats/independents to promote Yang over the next 4 years ("I voted for Biden; I expect Yang to have a place in his cabinet"/"Biden has so much potential to move UBI into the mainstream", etc.) than someone who wrote in Yang.</TEXT>

Has McConnell given any indication at all that he would pass a clean bill that includes ONLY $1200 stimulus checks for individuals? And is a single $1200 check really adequate for the problems we are facing? It's a nice talking point, but a $1200 check isn't going to be much help when my company goes under because they didn't get pandemic relief from the government, or because they could have weathered a 6-month downturn if the pandemic had been handled properly at a national and state level, but they can't handle this lingering and ongoing disaster with no end in sight.</TEXT>

So if the intent is to show support for Yang--it probably won't do much. Although it's understandable that people may not want to vote for Biden, a landslide victory over Trump will help give Biden and Democrats a mandate to move the country in a direction Yang wants it to go, and will move Yang closer to power and influence over the coming years. A Yang supporter who votes Biden is going to have more influence with Democrats than a Yang supporter who votes Yang. One will be viewed as a partner; the other will be viewed, rightly or wrongly, as a spoiler.</TEXT>

It's silly to spend time wallowing in regret for a near impossibility. Just remember how amazing it is that Yang took UBI from a fringe issue to something mainstream Democrats are talking about as a possibility in the span of a year. Instead focus on laying the groundwork for 2024: keep talking to your friends and family about Yang policies; join your local political groups and attend town halls with elected officials, asking them about automation, UBI, and other policies you find important. Keep steering the conversation toward that seriousness. It's a marathon, and it's going to take a lot of work to build a serious movement.</TEXT>

Just like in 2016, people have been trying to drive a wedge among Democrats and depress turnout using this "rigged" rhetoric. It's simply not true. That being said, Yang has thrown his support behind the candidate he knows will be best for the country, and with the party whose platform is most closely aligned with his own. Yang has already been changing the conversation, building alliances and making connections with Democrats up and down the ticket. He's on the right track, and the first step is prying Trump out of the White House.</TEXT>

He's offering to return our country to a place of respect and power on the global stage instead of being a global pariah. He's offering to appoint judges and justices who will be friendly to Yang's policies instead of installing people who will be hostile to them for a generation or more. He's offering to acknowledge and address climate change instead of denying and downplaying. Ditto for the pandemic. He's offering Yang a platform and a party that has the structure and resources to make Yang's ideas a reality. That's not going to happen from the outside, and it's not going to happen if we engage in some accelerationist fantasy of Trump's return to office being the catalyst for a Yang breakout.  #8203;  gt; What political party hold on to power that long? Go look at which party controlled all of Congress for how many years during the 20th century. It is those long periods of single-party control where things *actually get done*.

Climate change is number one.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/15/opinion/andrew-yang-nytimes-interview.html)  #8203; With that in mind, and with climate change being my top issue, I went looking to see how climate change rated in priority for the candidates so people can evaluate how capable these individuals may be in addressing the daunting challenges they will face in the next few years.  #8203; * [Yang's plan](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/climate-change/), for reference. * [Biden's plan](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/) * Trump's plan (there is no link because he doesn't have a climate change plan posted on his website. Or any plan, for anything, for that matter. I'm hoping that I am just looking in the wrong place and someone can share his actual plans.) * [Jorgensen's plan](https://jo20.com/issues/environment/) (actually just an "environment" plan, with no mention of climate change) * [Hawkins' plan](https://howiehawkins.us/ecosocialist-green-new-deal/) ("The Ecosocialist Green New Deal")</TEXT>

Does she even acknowledge it is a problem? Does she agree with Yang that costs need to be internalized so the market can actually work? Would she support a carbon fee + dividend to internalize those costs? And what do you mean by "backs nuclear more fully"? Biden already includes it as part of his [climate change plan](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/#).  gt;The fact that Joe Biden has [a $2 trillion climate plan](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/) that includes nuclear power means that things might actually move forward when he is elected  #8211; depending on what happens with the Senate.  gt;  gt;In particular, Biden #8217;s plan calls for development of [small modular reactors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2018/06/22/nuscales-small-modular-nuclear-reactor-reliable-resilient-and-flexible/#11e277451139), specifically because SMRs are ideal for load-following or [backing up wind](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/08/25/who-says-nuclear-cant-smooth-out-erratic-wind/#6d55d3cb2611), even better than natural gas. The Plan calls for  #8220;leveraging the carbon-pollution free energy provided by existing sources like nuclear and hydropower. #8221; #160;  gt;  gt;The Plan also calls to  #8220;Create a Advanced Research Projects Agency on Climate, a new, cross-agency ARPA-C to target affordable, game-changing technologies to help America achieve our 100% clean energy target, including #8230; #160;advanced nuclear reactors, that are smaller, safer, and more efficient at half the construction cost of today #8217;s reactors #8221; [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2020/08/17/what-will-a-biden-harris-administration-do-for-nuclear-energy/#16df96691dd9).</TEXT>

The short use ([12 minutes, on average](https://www.5gyres.org/plastic-bags/)) and long lifespan of the plastic bag have led to rising concerns. This is a challenge that is top-of-mind for communities and consumers who are concerned about the impact of single-use plastics on our environment and for brands who are seeking more sustainable solutions. Current alternatives can be costly and inconvenient, often trading one environmental issue for another. The retail bag needs reinventing.  gt;  gt;In August, the Consortium launched a global innovation challenge to source solutions to replace the current plastic bag - including tech-enabled reuse models, new materials, and software and hardware innovations.</TEXT>

It's a little unbelievable that the White House plan refuses to address actually containing and mitigating the virus itself in the relief plan, otherwise we're going to be right back here in 3 months trying to spend another $1.8 trillion. Direct cash relief for an indefinite span of time is not realistic; we need someone to be a grownup and deal with the source of the problem instead of constantly trying to slap a band-aid on the results of their failures.</TEXT>

Edit: I'm not quibbling about the suitability of the word "smeared". I'm saying that the all-caps shrieking of it is unworthy of our serious attention, and it detracts from having an actual conversation. Media like this wants to emotionally lead its audience by the nose, and we need to be better about not allowing it.</TEXT>

Now suddenly this sub is pushing a narrative that Pelosi is the only thing standing in the way of another stimulus and demanding that she pass Trump's bill, regardless of what other toxic pieces are in it? I get that Yang's shtick is getting money into people's hands, and that's a good thing, but this is a complex problem that won't be solved by throwing money at it. She passes this now and we'll be back begging for another couple trillion in 3 months. And 3 months after that.

Nobody cares about Pelosi except the people on this sub who keep trying to spin it into a bigger deal than it is. Out in the real world, media is focused on the SC nomination and whatever idiocy Trump is up to today. The news cycle has moved on from Pelosi; you probably should too.</TEXT>

The market would dictate that the populace is best when it is sick enough to require costly ongoing treatment, but not too sick to sell our labor. That's hardly the kind of system that Andrew Yang wants to see. That's why Yang favors MORE regulations on pharma, and he favors universal healthcare for Americans. Take a look at Yang's plan for pharma; note it doesn't include anything about deregulation but in fact favors a much stronger role for government: https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prescription-drug-costs/</TEXT>

Trump was supposed to be debating Biden at this exact time but he chose not to because the format was unfavorable to him. He managed to get NBC to schedule a town hall at the exact time as Biden's already-scheduled event in an effort to grab attention. It wasn't an official presidential debate. NBC offered Trump a platform--*their* platform. He accepted. Again, this wasn't an official presidential debate where the moderators had a duty to treat both candidates the same, because Trump declined to participate in that.

    <TEXT>Source? And is that really the most important, most critical, issue facing us as a country? How many people buy and use those products? Why is this more relevant than healthcare, jobs, climate change? Single-issue voters are handing over the country to people who are happy to manipulate those single issues in order to further an unrelated agenda. Doesn't seem like a very smart move.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a place for people to engage in dialog and try to understand other Americans. You seem to be upset that my comments don't align with your expectations of how others should feel. I'd love to hear what you think are the most critical and relevant issues facing the country, or why you think single-issue voting is a good thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But why is that the only relevant thing in his entire platform? Why does that outweigh anything else? And do you honestly not care how a legislator makes decisions on healthcare, jobs, national security, education, climate change, air and water pollution, as long as they agree with you about these two products that you want to continue to buy and use?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;bully people Disagreeing with someone is not bullying. This isn't a safe space where people aren't going to have their beliefs challenged. I am on this sub because I support Andrew Yang and want to see his policies passed. When people post things that are detrimental to those goals, I have no qualms about challenging them. That's not "bullying", no matter how offended you might feel at your beliefs being challenged.  #8203; ETA: I'd still love to hear what you think are the most critical and relevant issues facing the country, ~~or why you think single-issue voting is a good thing~~.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How is my comment above partisan? Healthcare, jobs, national security, education, climate, change--those are concerns relevant to all Americans. Being able to buy any kind of gun you want, on demand? Not so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know what? Vote for who you want to vote for.\* But don't do it performatively, sharing your Yang write-ins here in an attempt to virtue-signal your displeasure at the real choices we have. Don't get upset when people here rightly point out that a vote for Yang is not at all something that Yang wants, or that it will not help move him closer to office. Yet another copy-paste post about writing in Yang doesn't add to the conversation here, and it isn't doing anything to advance Yang's agenda. It's just making Yang's candidacy about you, not about Yang. ^(\*Just be sure to vote for people downticket who are going to support Yang's policies, like fighting climate change and advancing universal healthcare.)</TEXT>
