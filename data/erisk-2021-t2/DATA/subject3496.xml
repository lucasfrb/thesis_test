    <TITLE>The most versatile secondary weapon for the Scythe?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-04 11:42:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve just started getting into using Scythe, and just managed to grind up enough credits for a secondary weapon. The problem being is that I can #8217;t decide whether or not to use the Air-to-Air missiles or the Air-to-Ground rockets. So I #8217;d be thankful if any of you have recommendations for which I should use :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As some of you may know, all the Legend classes will get their own class specific trait. And Pathfinders current passive (the one where he scans the survey beacon) will be shared by all the Recon Class legends, and with the possibility of reapers and/or stalkers coming into the apex games It #8217;ll be fun to see if Pathfinder could hack into them (like in Titanfall 2) but depending on how OP they #8217;d be they #8217;ll have a certain range to their assigned area **OR** in range of a single survey beacon (maybe 100 meters?), I #8217;d like to hear if this would be viable or fun from the rest of the community</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a Wattson Main heres one thing you #8217;d want to do, **STAY BEHIND COVER** or **STAY IN A HOUSE** Why?, Because 1: You #8217;d be able to med, reload and res in safety 2: if you #8217;d need to place your ult (not always but if a gibby or bangalore uses their ult place it down) but especially indoors as most of the time people carry grenades. 3: Camp and fence in high places, Having your ult and fences in high-ground especially on-top of buildings and next to zip-lines can save your squad, as it gives your entire team a heads up. And also here #8217;s some positioning tips 1: Always go rotate/ defend somewhere with cover in a 3v3 it #8217;s always useful and even more so when you get third partied, its saved my life one-time when I was finishing a third-party and I was forced to 1v3 a fourth-party. 2: Don #8217;t Push without cover Even if your whole squads going to rush, you #8217;d all be weak or one person would be knocked. Having cover in your rush direction (especially if it #8217;s mid-ranged) can save your squads life and may be able to give you some kills</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can #8217;t play with you (I #8217;m on PS4) but here are a few tips to gain points 1: Try your best not to engage on squad **V** squad close-range fights (As these are the ones you #8217;d most likely be third partied in), same for long range fights, you #8217;ll only wan #8217;t to tap them **UNLESS** You #8217;re certain no one else will third party. 2: Try to stay in a area which gives your team an advantage. (E.G caustic/wattson in building or tight areas) 3. Don #8217;t push on coverless areas, this can and most likely get you lazered as you push.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is Highly Unlikely , as Ashe was a Simulacrum she had a Past Life as a Pilot. Whilst Voidwalker Wraith was a Senior Science Pilot working with the ARES Division on Typhon (before the events of the Titanfall 2 campaign) which were working on Phase-shift technology as seen on Ronin and the Phase-shift ability from both Titanfall 2 and her own ability. Ashe was Employed by the IMC to help them work on the Reapers in Huge Underground complexes (Much like those from the Voidwalker Story) and was her original body was (Presumably) Destroyed against her fight against BT and Cooper. One of the biggest questions we all need to answer is why her body was in there and who put it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>-Who put/rebuilt Ash #8217;s Body in the loot bunker -Which memory core/body is she using now?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 11:35:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is quite a long one, so be prepared. Also for no confusions I #8217;m also referring to The Quest Kings Canyon as Shadow Kings Canyon. This also contains major spoilers for the Titanfall 2 campaign along with the Quest. __Who #8217;s Ash and what #8217;s her Backstory__ __Ash__ was a __Simulacrum__ (Much like Revenant) who was employed by the IMC to help with their Reaver program on __Typhon__ (The same Planet where Void-walker Wraith was working on Phase-Shift technology) before it was destroyed. She also was employed by original __Apex Predators__ with their leader being the creator of the Apex Games __Kuben Blisk__. __Which head/body is it?__ In the Titanfall 2 campaign __Ash__ was (Presumably) destroyed by __Cooper and BT__, and in the Titanfall 2 multiplayer __Ash__ was Rebuilt by __Vinson Dynamics__ with a Memory wipe, and helped eliminate the __Remnant IMC forces__ in hopes of gathering data about her Past in the __Data-banks__ of said Remnant IMC forces. Those are the 2 bodies and memory cores of of Ash and right now we don #8217;t know if this is a third one or one of the 2. I personally think it #8217;s the original body and memory-core from Typhon as we don #8217;t get any confirmation of her dying, the only hints of her  #8216;dying #8217; was the scream she made when she was destroyed along with her Custom Ronin, and the Fact she says __ #8216;Do you fear me Pilot? #8217;__ which was something she said __(need confirmation)__ when trying to eliminate Jack Cooper and another one of her voice-lines  #8216;[Five by Five](https://youtu.be/0IoEAU5ydZ4) #8217; was said by Viper, another member of the Original Apex Predators before he was killed By Cooper and BT. But for the Body it #8217;s not quite clear which body It may have been (explained in the next section) __You have alot of evidence it should be Ashe #8217;s old body/head Right?__ This would have almost guaranteed that this was Ash #8217;s Original body with only 1 (Technically 2) things trying to split this apart. __The Twin Gemini cores__ which are used from storing memory for Simulacrums and Robots. Which  #8216;couldn #8217;t be recovered #8217; along with her body as said by Vinson Dynamics before the destruction of Typhon. __(Unless the Body stored the memory which then would lead the next few paragraphs to be useless.)__ But there #8217;s two teeny tiny detail #8217;s that I don #8217;t think most of you realised that makes this sub-theory 99.8% possible about this being the original memory core and the body 1:The artefacts were in Shadow Kings Canyon and possibly the body were located in Shadow Kings Canyon. 2: There #8217;s only 2 people that we know of that can access Shadow Kings Canyon by themselves. The first person being __Wraith__ and the second one being __Void-Walker Wraith__ Only 1 of which were present on Typhon. I believe __Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey AKA Void-Walker Wraith__ Buried the components of Ash #8217;s head on Shadow Kings Canyon, though I don #8217;t know the motives but I here #8217;s what I __Speculate__. __again this paragraph is speculation__ Renee worked in the Dynamic Testing Facility (In another section) and when she heard or got told by her Voices that Ash Died she got the Components of her head and possibly the body aswell and brought them over to Shadow Kings Canyon, and In order to protect them she buried them in quite secret and remote locations before travelling back to the Dimension where Typhon Exploded and where the Apex Games are a popular Blood-Sport. This is a bit solidified when Loba volunteered Wraith to open portals to Shadow Kings Canyon, She would have only known this if she had known about the Original Wraith from this dimension Renee Blasey. __Who did put Ash #8217;s body in the Loot Bunker?__ There are 2 main Candidates for this 1: Blisk. Though he doesn #8217;t have alot of backing him up for this it #8217;s quite possible that it was him due to him being on Typhon and Him possible caring for her. 2: Loba She was Paid by Hammond Robotics to retrieve the Artefacts from Shadow Kings Canyon. It #8217;s not clear if she was also paid to retrieve the body (if so it would have been clear as she wasn #8217;t selectable for the first few missions, and explains why she knew were to find her body in the loot bunker) __Recap__ -Ash is a Simulacrum like Revenant and had 2 seperate bodies and memory cores. -There are 2 possible Memory-Cores of Ash that the Artifacts could have been used for her head, and 2 possible bodies for her to use in the loot-bunker (both are equally plausible) -It #8217;s likely that Renee Blasey/Voidwalker Wraith put the Artifacts and also the Body In Shadow Kings Canyon Thanks for enduring all of this reading.

    <TEXT>Tip 1:If you #8217;re using a Standard PS4 controller I highly recommend your crouch to L1, Tactical to R1, Jump to R3 and Ping to O. These keybind really help as you can crouch spam easily I personally use these myself. Tip 2: Don #8217;t just push into ring, If you have a good Gate-Keeping position deny them the ring and a easy wipe Tip 3: Always have cover, especially when your pushing. If you don #8217;t have cover especially now with the New armour you #8217;ll probably get devo #8217;d right in the Face. If you have cover you could always just hide behind it and Shoot/Heal when you need too Tip 4: Act as a Unit, this may be hard when you don #8217;t have a Full Pre-made squad with VC, but just try and follow them. If one of your squad is pushing by themselves you should always support them. As it #8217;s you #8217;re more likely to win a 2v3 then a 1v3</TEXT>

Extreme Mag-size plus DPS, Volt just adds a bit more Range 2: Turbocharged Havoc + Volt.

    <TEXT>-Get to high-ground. Shiela has a 140 degree of vertical rotation which means usually no matter where you put Sheila you #8217;re most likely gonna rain literal hell. -Use LMGs, Devotion is the Meta right now and with a Purple Mag + Your passive, you can have 58 bullets per mag. Not to mention the Rapid Reloads which make the Devotion even more Broken -Rampart is like Crypto. There are two (technically 3) major ways to play her. Indoors and outdoors. If your Indoors place your Walls on door as this can make the enemy decide not to push, I recommend putting Sheila if the room is small and doesn #8217;t have many entry points. If your outdoors try to place Walls near the mountains/natural walls as this can make sure you #8217;re not going to be jumped/third partied easily. The 3rd way is Bunker-busting. If a Entire squad is behind a (Breakable) door in a Small room. Place Shelia as close as you can to said door and shoot right through it. Shelia is the only gun that can break doors. I #8217;ve managed to ruin a entire squad using this. -Don #8217;t be afraid of dumping your mag, Sheila #8217;s accuracy gets better the longer you shoot for, much like a Devotion.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are Lib's effective/viable as ground support just with a single crew member?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 13:26:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've recently started taking a Ground-Support Role in my Scythe, and actually enjoying it quite a bit. I'm a solo player almost all the time and I've seen how effective Lib's can be when they're Fully manned, both in ground support and in A2A combat. So I was wondering if the Lib is effective/viable when you're a solo player, any insight will be appreciated :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry I'm late! Due to how the Fold Weapon actually destroys things, it's safe to say that the Ark is some sort of Gravitational and Energy based Sphere/Spheroid. Though with Horizon having the Ark 2 Major Problems/Sub-Theories arise 1: How did Horizon even get the Ark? Based on how she looks (personally to me) she looks to be mid-around her mid 40's, and if Titanfall 2 and Apex are roughly 30 or 7-15 years apart (as there is conflicting evidence) how did she get ahold of the Ark in the First Place? 2: How did Horizen even test/measure the Ark to make her Gravity lifts? We know in Apex/Titanfall Jumpdrives exist which I personally think that they rely on creating positive Gravitational Distortions (Where things get attracted to each other) to accelerate to FTL speeds or Near Light Speeds. Though the problem here is wether The Ark can be used to generate Negative Gravitational Waves or Positive waves or if it can be used to generate both of them. As seen on Typhon and it's moon we see them both Shattered, as we run to the evac Zone where Barker and Sarah come rescue us. We see these massive objects get lifted up into before we'd see Typhon get shattered with parts of its crust get sent flying into mid-air. We also see that when we use the Gravity lifts they lift us up into the ajr with almost no effort. This is evidence leaning towards that the Ark can be used to generate Negative Gravity, but there is also not enough evidence to 100% confirm its Positive gravity. Hell it may even be able to generate both types of Gravity Please comment if you have any evidence/theories to help us know how Horizon got the Ark and what type of Gravity the Ark can Generate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That Blisk and Ash's theory is mosy likely true, if the games are 7-15 years after the events of Titanfall 2, but if you fill in that hole and say 'Blisk and Ash' got the Ark to Horizon a even bigger sub-theory/plot hole, as why would Blisk and Ash give the Ark to Horizon. This wouldn't happen (which is most likely) if they were friends though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Ark and The Fold Weapon are seperate, but inter-twined things, the Ark generates either Positive or Negative Gravity, and the Fold Weapon used/amplifies those gravity waves to create destruction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No no, BT destroyed the Fold Weapon via using his reactor to destabilise the waves of energy/gravity that the Ark was giving off, and in turn destroying the Fold Weapon but not the Ark, think of the Ark as a Pillow and the Fold Weapon as ~~your siblings~~ a piece of furniture, you can hit your ~~siblings~~ furniture with the pillow as hard as you can, the waves of the force created by the pillow would travel through the object breaking/disrupting it but not the pillow itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're spot on, If Horizon worked for the Ares Divison who was run by General Marder, the same person who hired the Apex Predators, its highly possible/plausible that they met there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I explained why in another comment but I'll explain it as simply as I can. Think of the Ark as a Pillow, and the Fold Weapon is whatever you'd wanna hit, the pillow will (almost) never get damaged when hitting stuff but whatever your hitting will get damaged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Holy shit I'm sorry for replying late to this. The thing is we don't know what The Ark is, nor what it's made out of and if its indestructible or not. With it surviving a implosion that destroyed a entire planet, I think it's safe to say that the Ark may be indestructible. As for how she got her hands on it, there's only 1 thing that came to mind, IMC didn't (completely) disband after the Battle of Typhon, there were still remnants, with one of the largest ones being the Ares Divison, which was still lead by General Marder, it's possible that he tasked someone/some group to get it to potentially study it, and when the communications blackout happened and when both the Militia and the IMC Remnant left the frontier, it's possible they left in a hurry, leaving the Ark in a completely secret, yet secure location. Where Horizon found it and conducted experiments/tests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry that you had to right this and I'm replying with such short statments but here are the plot holes 1: There is no way to salvage a solid ball of energy, as a literal solid ball of energy almost be indestructible, you can't create 100% new energy nor 100% destroy energy, you can only transform energy, this is a cycle that exists in our world and most likely exists in the Apex/Titanfall world. BT's reactor most likely caused that energy to be transformed into most likely gravitational energy, or releasing anti-matter, a release of gravitational energy is most plausible here 2: That theory could be true, but it is most likely not, as even Respawn confirmed that Apex and Titanfall are in the same universe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given that the Ares Division, the literal blade of all research and technologies couldn't even justify who/what made it, and if it's even naturally occuring. It's highly unlikely, if that were the case, almost the entirety of the Outlands and the Frontier would be scarred with shattered planets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's the thing, Space and Time distort around Gravity distorting space time would require Gravity, and lots of it. If you can/would want to, please read/check out Einsteins Theory of General Relativity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What if she knows Blisk and Ash are alive? Perhaps "Remember, you're a long time dead" is directed to Ash, as she's been reborn/rebuilt at least 4 times (including her actual birth and where Path-Finder rebuilds her)</TEXT>
