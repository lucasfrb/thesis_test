    <TEXT>Lmao, nice comment. To be honest I think these games were created with a slight nudge at the player in the direction to choose Ashly and in almost all previous playthroughs I had saved her but for once I though kaiden deserved a break. The game has 100% the plot and side missions that I deemed interesting enough to include. Mass Effect 2 Next :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Coming face to face with my sister's Doppelganger</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-21 19:46:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>One of my oldest childhood memories that sticks out purely because of how dumbfounded i was at the time, was when me and my family lived in Eindhoven in Holland in the late 1980s. We were originally from the UK but my father had moved the whole family over there because of a job offer. Being only 4 at the time my happy memories of our life there is very fragmented but i still remember how big the house was and how it had that 'new house smell'. It also had three floors and four bedrooms which was fantastic for me as i didn't have to share a bedroom with my older sister Rachel. When we moved in the whole street was still being built around us, we still have photos in our family album of the four of us with our 80 #8217;s hairstyles standing outside our home with the drive way just a square patch of dirt, no grass and no pavement. As our house was the first home to be completed I got to see a lot of the construction going on around which was very exciting for a 4 year old boy. The night I remember the most clearly began with me waking up in bed in the early hours of the morning, I remember that it was in the early hours because of the one single street lamp outside that used to flood my entire bedroom in orange had turned off. I remember wanting to go sleep in my parents bed so I climbed out of bed and opened my door. The way the rooms were situated was my room was at the front of the house, outside my room was a long hall with my parents #8217; bedroom immediately on my right, the stairwell on my left, On the other end of this hall was the bathroom and right of that was my sister #8217;s bedroom. So usually all I have to do is open my bedroom door, take a step and turn right and boom, there #8217;s mum and dad sleeping soundly. As I stepped out of my bedroom on this night however something before me caught my eye. Right in front of the bathroom door in her nightdress was my sister Rachel, I remember her just standing perfectly still and smiling at me with a big grin. I remember saying something along the lines of  #8220;what are you doing? #8221; but she wouldn #8217;t answer me, she just kept right on staring at me. I didn #8217;t feel threatened, just a little confused. I turned to my right to see my parents sleeping soundly. I finally started to approach my sister who just continued to smile while I got closer and closer. When I was finally close enough to be face to face she slowly turned her head to her left and as I followed her gaze into her bedroom I could see Rachel sound asleep clutching her rainbow bright doll. I remember feeling scared then, that #8217;s when I first felt real fear. I looked back to this person in front of me who didn #8217;t say anything but just kept on smiling at me and I started to take steps backwards. As I started my slow retreat I realised that her smile was starting to fall into a frown and that #8217;s when I ran into my parent #8217;s bedroom That #8217;s when the next strange thing happened. For the life of me I could not get my parents to wake, I pulled at the blankets and shouted at them but they didn #8217;t even stir. I even remember physically opening my mum #8217;s eyelids to try and wake her but nothing. In the end I had crawled under the blankets and I woke up the following morning with both parents laughing at the fact that I had managed to get into the bed. I remember telling my mum about the girl who looked like Rachel and she did the normal parent thing by telling me it must have been a dream. But I knew it wasn #8217;t and the memory has always stuck with me. Has anyone ever had an experience like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the feedback, just to clarify, the frown was more like in disapointment, not anger, if i'm honest i don't think i actually felt thretened, i was scared because even at a young age i knew this situation wasn't normal. Makes me think though that the first house in the area to be built and it attracts an entity? I never saw her again after that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very interesting story, i was tempted to sugest that maybe you both simply got lost in your conversation so lost your perception on time but that wouldn't explain the radio glitch, reminds me of a story i heard once about a guy who stayed late after work one night and when he finally left and was driving his car down the motorway he looked over to the on coming traffic on the other side to see his own car, and himself behind the wheel, he said what was even more strange is that if he hadn't stayed late after work that is where his car would have been.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first time i ever brought it up was only recently, she found it unnerving but at the same time she said it sounded familiar, so maybe i had mentioned it over the years. She had jokingly commented that it could have been her astral projecting but it's highly doubtful as that would have been the first and last time she's ever managed such a feat.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Woman in White (WW2 story)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-26 01:51:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I was kid we used to visit my grandparent #8217;s house every Saturday, my grandmother, a retired baker, used to always cook enough food to feed a small army, my grandfather would sit down in his favourite arm chair and regale his 9 year old grandson on the horrors of World War 2whilst drinking his glass of brandy. It wasn #8217;t as bad as it sounds as he would often sensor his story for my young ears when talking to me while still making sure to get the lessons across. Either way I didn #8217;t care I loved his story no matter the topic of choice. One afternoon as I sat there beside my granddad, the television was showing old archive war footage of the war and I guess it had jogged a memory inside my granddad because he started telling me about how when he was in the army he was being trained for the Normandy landing but didn #8217;t quite make it there like his brothers had. I #8217;ve managed to go through this story with my father who also had the story told to him when he was young so I could verify parts of the story I had forgotten. The story went as follows. My granddad at the age of 18 was a British paratrooper and was part of the 1st Airborn Division. The division was formed in 1941, after British Prime Minister Winston Churchill demanded an airborne force. The Division would specialise in sending ground infantry from the air across enemy lines and it was throught to be a great tactic to use during the Normandy Landings. Unfortunately the Division was not used during the landings and instead was kept in reserve, something my grandfather always regretted as his brothers went to Normandy without him. One day in December 1943 while my grandfather was training for an attack in Arnhem, Holland a request was made for soldiers who would be willing to test out a new prototype for the Hamilcar Mark I. The Hamilcar was a large British military glider which was designed to carry heavy cargo. After my Granddad had signed up he was then told what it was they were going to be training for. The plan was to find out if it was possible to drop a Tank from the glider over enemy lines and see if the parachute could slow the tank #8217;s decent enough for a safe landing. If this could work eventually they would have dropped tanks on the beaches in Normandy which I #8217;m pretty sure would have made for a different kind of  #8216;Saving Private Ryan #8217;. What can I say my grandfather was the gun hoe adventure type and couldn #8217;t wait to test this crazy scheme. Fast forward a few months later and my grandfather with two of his colleagues were crammed into this heavy tin can like sardines and waited patiently in the cargo hold of the glider asit reached its destination not too far from the base. The plan of the day was for the tank to be ejected from the glider, Parachute to the ground and for my Granddad to drive it back to base safely. After what felt like an eternity my granddad remembered hearing the statement over their radios that the cargo hold was about to open and they would be essentially dropped like a stone from the aircraft. He synchronised his watch and began his countdown internally so the tank #8217;s parachute would get ejected at the right moment.  #8220;You #8217;d probably think you wouldn #8217;t be that aware of the drop inside the tank #8221; my granddad would say.  #8220;But you feel everything and my mate over to my left was screaming in terror #8221; The time came and the parachute was deployed. It was at that moment that my granddad knew it hadn #8217;t worked. The chute was deployed but the speed of the decent was so great it had no effect on gravity. Just as he was about to voice this little concern there was a loud crash and everything went dark. As he began to come too my Granddad was aware of excruciating pain in his left hand and liquid running down his face. He felt weightless and cold. As his eyes began to focus he began to see greenery, and branches and smoke. He looked down and could see grass, only it was about 15 feet away. The tank had become lodged into the canopy of a tree, my grandfather had fallen out of the turret hatch and was only saved by his hand which was crushed flat between parts of a twisted caterpillar track. His position was as such that he could see into the darkness of the hatch where his two colleagues were. As he began trying to calm himself he called into the hatch for the other two. There was no reply but in the darkness my Granddad could faintly make out the outline of his friend and his features.  #8220;It looked to me that he was just sitting there smiling at me, so I yelled at him to get off his ass and help me #8221; my Granddad remembers. After a moment of nothing but silence from the other two my granddad began to worry about the liquid that was running down his face and the smoke coming from the other side of the tank. He was worried the liquid could have been fuel and that the tank could explode at any moment. He reached into his pocket with his free hand and pulled out his knife and without much hesitation was beginning to get to work on severing his crushed hand. Just then he heard a calm soft voice from below say  #8220;Don #8217;t do that #8221; He adjusted his position as best as he could and looked down to the floor. There on a white horse was one of the most beautiful women my granddad had ever seen. He made sure of course to tell me this part of the story out of earshot of my grandma who was cooking in the other room. The woman was dressed in a white dress and her hair was bright blond, there seemed to be a sort of illumination coming from her as she looked up at my granddad with a great look of concern on her face.  #8220;But I #8217;m stuck #8230; and the fuel #8221; my granddad shouted down in panic.  #8220;It #8217;s not fuel you silly man, it #8217;s water #8221; came the calm voice again. Ignoring this advice he put the blade against the skin of his crushed hand when she spoke again.  #8220;Please don #8217;t, they #8217;re coming to get you, I can see them, and they #8217;re almost here #8221; she shouted. My granddad with his knife still in hand put his knuckles to his forehead, he tasted the liquid and it was indeed water. He dropped the knife and put his hand to his other pocket and retrieved his torch. He managed to shine it into the hatch and what he saw was an image that he struggled with for a long time after. His friend who he thought to be smiling at him wasn #8217;t smiling; one of the consoles had exploded leaving his face pretty much unrecognisable. He didn #8217;t have to look much longer to know that both men were dead. My granddad was about to scream when he heard the sound of car engines and sirens. Within moments the army, fire crew and medical crews were at the scene. Within a short while they managed to free my Granddad without removing his hand but it would take many months of operations and an ox bone to give my granddad something that resembles a working hand. While my granddad was passing in and out of consciousness he asked his the medic where the woman on the white horse had gone and to his astonishment he was informed that from where the rescue crew were they could see the crash site and there was never a civilian, or  #8220;woman in white #8221; anywhere near the tree let alone a white horse and that he must have imagined her. Decades later and my granddad always remembered the woman, not just because of her beauty but he thinks she saved his life that day. If he had severed his hand and fallen from that height to the ground below I probably wouldn #8217;t be writing this story down right now. What #8217;s more bizarre is that many men of my family claim to have seen this  #8216;Woman in white #8217; over the years. My dad thinks she #8217;s sort of a guardian angel that protects the family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After much deliberation i finally decided that Mass Effect 2 will exist on my channel in two halves (Part 1  amp; Part 2). This is because after i had finished editing and combining all sixteen parts i discovered that even after all my editing i was still looking at a ten hour long movie. My first thought was to start doing some serious slicing and dicing of the footage in an effort to bring the run time down to a more suitable length but then came to the contusion... why? I had edited each part with only the parts of the game i wanted to show and had already discarded the rest so i decided to not strip anything out but instead split the movie into two halves. Hope you enjoy Part 1, Part 2 will be up very soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my oldest childhood memories that sticks out purely because of how dumbfounded i was at the time, was when me and my family lived in Eindhoven in Holland in the late 1980s. We were originally from the UK but my father had moved the whole family over there because of a job offer. Being only 4 at the time my happy memories of our life there is very fragmented but i still remember how big the house was and how it had that 'new house smell'. It also had three floors and four bedrooms which was fantastic for me as i didn't have to share a bedroom with my older sister Rachel. When we moved in the whole street was still being built around us, we still have photos in our family album of the four of us with our 80 #8217;s hairstyles standing outside our home with the drive way just a square patch of dirt, no grass and no pavement. As our house was the first home to be completed I got to see a lot of the construction going on around which was very exciting for a 4 year old boy. The night I remember the most clearly began with me waking up in bed in the early hours of the morning, I remember that it was in the early hours because of the one single street lamp outside that used to flood my entire bedroom in orange had turned off. I remember wanting to go sleep in my parents bed so I climbed out of bed and opened my door. The way the rooms were situated was my room was at the front of the house, outside my room was a long hall with my parents #8217; bedroom immediately on my right, the stairwell on my left, On the other end of this hall was the bathroom and right of that was my sister #8217;s bedroom. So usually all I have to do is open my bedroom door, take a step and turn right and boom, there #8217;s mum and dad sleeping soundly. As I stepped out of my bedroom on this night however something before me caught my eye. Right in front of the bathroom door in her nightdress was my sister Rachel, I remember her just standing perfectly still and smiling at me with a big grin. I remember saying something along the lines of  #8220;what are you doing? #8221; but she wouldn #8217;t answer me, she just kept right on staring at me. I didn #8217;t feel threatened, just a little confused. I turned to my right to see my parents sleeping soundly. I finally started to approach my sister who just continued to smile while I got closer and closer. When I was finally close enough to be face to face she slowly turned her head to her left and as I followed her gaze into her bedroom I could see Rachel sound asleep clutching her rainbow bright doll. I remember feeling scared then, that #8217;s when I first felt real fear. I looked back to this person in front of me who didn #8217;t say anything but just kept on smiling at me and I started to take steps backwards. As I started my slow retreat I realised that her smile was starting to fall into a frown and that #8217;s when I ran into my parent #8217;s bedroom That #8217;s when the next strange thing happened. For the life of me I could not get my parents to wake, I pulled at the blankets and shouted at them but they didn #8217;t even stir. I even remember physically opening my mum #8217;s eyelids to try and wake her but nothing. In the end I had crawled under the blankets and I woke up the following morning with both parents laughing at the fact that I had managed to get into the bed. I remember telling my mum about the girl who looked like Rachel and she did the normal parent thing by telling me it must have been a dream. But I knew it wasn #8217;t and the memory has always stuck with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last year i had a dream where i was communicating with a dead relative through iPhone text messages. In the dream it wasn't that my relative was actually dead, merely i was texting her through time into the past when she was still alive. And we're talking years in the past, a decade where cell phones weren't around let alone texting. Ah dream logic (or lack there of). The really strange part was when i awoke in the morning i did the usual thing to reach for my iphone and i had 1 text message during the night, i read it and it was a completely blank text sent from "unkown number". When i exited out of my text inbox right next to the blank message where it states the date received it said 01/01/1970. My phone's date and time settings were correct.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah gotcha, i'm not sure the price issue was a big deal for me, purely because i've spent silly amounts for games that turned out to be total horse shit. Gone Home was so enjoyable to me it earned its money. You only have to look at the reviews and awards it's managed to rack up to see that people haven't been over all that critical. More praise than anything. As for replay value, more and more people are dusting it off for speed runs (not kidding) i think the quickest play is a minute or something. Also it runs very well with the Oculus rift.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reminds me of a case a few years ago in the UK, a man whose life basically ran like clockwork, he'd get up, drive to work, finish work and drive home at the exact same time every day without fail and always took the same highway. One afternoon he decided to stick around a little longer to talk to a colleague which resulted in him leaving work 20 minutes later than usual. As he was driving he spotted a car that was an exact copy of his own and being twilight hours without much traffic on ether side of the highway he started to slow a little. He noticed the person on the other side was also slowing down. When both cars almost perfectly aligned he saw himself staring back at him. A while later after he'd calmed down he realised that the other car, other him was at the exact spot he would have been if he had left on time that day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way it was described was, imagine a two - lane road separated by a low barrier, at one end of the road is a round about which the guy would use to get onto the opposite side. But the road is long and would usually take him 20 minutes to get to that side, which he would have been if he hadn't been aprox 20 minutes late.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not much more to add that hasn't already been said but I've had situations where my cat has simply disappeared from my home. I live on the top floor of a small apartment complex and as I live alone I ritually make sure all access points are "locked And bolted" and that my cat has enough water and food for the night and then get some sleep. One morning I woke up for work and couldn't find a trace of him, his food and litter tray had been messed with so he'd been in the apartment before I went to sleep. I checked every corner and crawl space, every cupboard he didn't respond to calls. When it was time for work I was almost reluctant to leave and then here he is sitting up proudly on my kitchen counter like its some game. It's happened a few times now</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A great read thanks for sharing!, I actually grew up in Eindhoven in the 80s before moving to he UK. We had a house with a big field behind our house, if my memory serves the estate was still being built around us and our house was the first built. Our garden was full of Christmas trees which is why the start of your story intrigued me. I have a ghost story of sorts which involved 5 year old me seeing a little girl in a white night dress who disappeared as I got closer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few years ago I worked as a sales manager for a retail store, I remember one month the number 666 followed me everywhere. My rationality was convincing me it's because I work in a place where I deal with numbers every day in the form of currency, sizes and telephone numbers etc. But it got to a point where it became rediculous, I'd check the total amount of cash in my till draw one morning and it's  #163;666, a customer asked me for a pair of shoes, I check the code on the back of the shoe it's style number 666, I get a missed call on the company phone and it's from a number ending in 666. This went on all day once.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Hello?" - A Ghost In Retail</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-01 12:36:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>This happened to me about five years ago while I had the  #8220;privilege #8221; of working in a men #8217;s suit store while studying at a college in Cardiff, Wales. For anyone who is curious Wales sits just left of England and directly right of Ireland. Cardiff is a nice city, nowhere near as big as England but it has gone through some pretty rapid modernisation of late. They #8217;ve done a great job at keeping their historic architecture but there always seems to be a new Starbucks or Costa Coffee opening up every other week. Some of the buildings in the city center have shiny new facades that wrap around the ancient structures like a shell. This became more evident to me on my first day at the store. My interview for the job took place bright and early one February morning and I remember how cold I was as I made my way passed the hustle and bustle of early morning commuters. Having been a student for year I wasn #8217;t used to being around so many people this early in the morning. That being said I wasn #8217;t really used to being up in the morning period. When I arrived a good fifteen minutes before my interview was due to start I was greeted by an immaculate looking man in a pin stripe suit who I quickly recognised to be my new potential boss. His name was Andrew, he was a friendly guy in his mid-fifties, silver grey hair and just looked how you expect a manager of a suit store to look. After greeting me he took me down to the bowels of the building where the staff room was located. We had to make our way down two flights of stairs and through a hallway full of your standard retail fixtures. I remember almost having a heart attack when turning a corner and coming face to face with a naked mannequin just standing there with its hands on its hips defiantly.  #8220;Ah sorry about that, I stripped it yesterday as we needed the garment for another display upstairs, not very modest is he #8221; Andrew said lightly with a chuckle. I laughed too. I felt comfortable before the interview had begun, this guy had a sense of humour. When we entered the main stock room I was a little blown away. The walls, ceiling and flooring were completely different to upstairs. They weren #8217;t just bricks but old carved bricks. The only thing I can compare it to off the top of my head would be something that resembles catacombs. Big archways hug over head in badly eroded red stone and the tiles beneath our feet were a dark marble. Andrew, upon seeing my wondering eyes began to speak again.  #8220;Ah yes I forget people are usually surprised when they walk in here, I guess I #8217;m used to it  #8220; he opened a wooden door that lead into a posh looking staff room complete with carpeted floor, a polished oak table and a brown leather couch.  #8220;What I found amazing was when I learnt the basement down here as well as the basements in all the neighbouring buildings all look the same, they were once part of a Victorian tunnel you see, that connected every building in the street. Some kind of evacuation tunnel #8221; Andrew finished and indicated for me to take a seat. Two years later I had finished my course in college and had been asked by Andrew if I wanted a full time position while I figured out what my next step was going to be. Naturally I accepted as I really did love the job and the people I worked with had become like family to me. Life being the way it was I found myself struggling to find jobs that although I was now qualified for, lacked the  #8220;experience in a similar field #8221; it was infuriating, how could I have experience if nobody will give me a break? Another two years after becoming a full time member of staff I was still at the store but I had managed to progress from  #8216;Part Time Sales Assistant #8217; to  #8216;Assistant Manager #8217; which was great for me as it meant a tasty pay rise and great for Andrew as it meant he could finally take more time off, take vacations and be with his family. I actually really began to enjoy the extra responsibility, training new staff, delegating jobs and helping our team to hit sales targets. We are now coming to the reason I am writing this. The reason I will never forget that place. It all went down one Sunday Morning. Sunday #8217;s obviously being the quieter days of trade only required a  #8216;skeleton crew #8217; to run the Store. This is usually a manager (me) and one other sales assistant (in this case a girl named Amy). I quite liked working with Amy, we were of similar ages, she was cute and really down to earth. Most of our quiet periods were spent talking about everything and anything about our lives until we realised how much time had passed and began creating jobs to do out of guilt. One Sunday afternoon after a pretty uneventful morning I walked into our office just off the shop floor to email our sales figures to head office while Amy manned the front desk. As we had two sales floors (upstairs was suits and downstairs was accessories / shoes) if someone went downstairs either Amy or myself would have to go with them. One of our rules was that under no circumstances were customers to walk around downstairs unattended. As I began entering figures into a new excel spreadsheet I heard Amy #8217;s faint voice under the store #8217;s collection of non-threatening store music. If my memory serves me correctly I believe it was Nickelback she was quite rudely interrupting. I reached for the knob of the Hifi and turned down the volume.  #8220; #8230;. Want me to go? #8221; Amy called. I poked my head out of the office door.  #8220;Sorry what? #8221;  #8220;An elderly lady just went downstairs would you like me to go down? Or do you want me to watch the shop floor and you go down? #8221; I looked back at the barely started spreadsheet and then back to Amy.  #8220;Its fine I #8217;ll go, maybe I can sell her a sports jacket and cufflinks #8221; I said with a smile.  #8220;Oh do it! #8221; Amy giggled as I walked passed her. As I made my way down the steps to the ground floor I was surprised to find that nobody was there. The room looked pristine and untouched. I took a few steps forward and stretched my neck looking along the rows of formal jackets.  #8220;Amy? #8221; I called up stairs. I heard her shuffle along from the till to the doorway.  #8220;Yello? #8221; she asked.  #8220;I thought you said there was a lady down here? #8221; I asked quickly glancing back at the room.  #8220;There is #8230; I watched her go down myself #8221; she said again confidently. I walked the full length of the room, passed the shoe displays to the changing rooms and back.  #8220;Nope, no one here #8230; are you seeing things? #8221; I asked. Amy looked both confused and annoyed.  #8220;What? Can I come down? #8221; she asked.  #8220;Yes but quickly #8221; I watched as she made her way around the room and back.  #8220;What the fuck #8230;. #8221; She uttered under her breath while pulling back the curtains of the changing room.  #8220;See just like I said, you #8217;re seeing things #8221;  #8220;I swear to god this is freaky #8230; I literally watched her enter the store at the entrance, the doorbell even chimed, I smiled at her and she just walked down here #8221; Amy finished. I noticed that colour seemed to be fading from her usually rosy cheeks. Just then I had a sinking feeling.  #8220;What if she #8217;s gone down into the basement? #8221; I asked eyebrows raised. Amy put her hand to her mouth in a  #8220;oh fuck #8221; fashion.  #8220;Ugh what if she #8217;s senile or something and just went down there? Did she acknowledge you when you smiled at her? #8221; I questioned. Amy #8217;s eyes looked upwards in thought before returning to me.  #8220;She didn #8217;t #8230; I thought she was just being rude. #8221;  #8220;Okay, go back upstairs I #8217;ll go find her #8221; I said a little exasperated. I really wasn #8217;t looking forward to this part of the job. One thing I learned from working in the fabulous world of retail is you often meet people from both sides of the mental health spectrum. My second week working at the store some guy politely used one of our changing rooms to try on a shirt and in doing so took it upon himself to urinate into the small trash can in there. Guess which rookie member of the team has the pleasure of fixing this problem? As I entered the basement level the first thing to hit me was the void of total darkness. Funny thing about wondering around in the dark, you usually have some sort of natural light so you can at least see your hand in front of your face. But here, deep underground if the lights were off you were pretty much Stevie Wondering. My hand went to my left and frantically felt for the switch and with a sigh of relief I flicked it back. The florescent tube light bulbs flickered into existence for a few moments before bursting light to all corners of the basement and as my eyes adjusted I quickly scanned around.  #8220;Nobody #8221; I said with relief. The basement stockroom was quiet and untouched and also a complete mess. It was all of our jobs to keep the stockroom tidy but over the weeks of constant deliveries it had become more or less a dumping ground with crates stacked on top of each other. Another reason to not wanting to be wondering around here in the dark. As I began to turn back to the door while thinking how it was going to be my sad duty to inform one of my colleagues #8217; that she #8217;s been hallucinating. I distinctly heard the sound of a refrigerator door closing. I quickly turned to the direction of the staff room. The door was closed but the light from within seeped through the gap under the door. My heart began to race. The old lady was here #8230; she must have somehow navigated her way through the stock room in the dark and was now making herself at home in our staff room, probably attempting to make herself a nice cup of tea perhaps. Without really thinking I marched forward and pushed the door open. I was greeting with an empty staff room. The bags and coats hung neatly on peg hooks on the far wall, cutlery lay strewn around the draining board and a dirty washrag was lazily dumped on top of them (my bad). I remember thinking that perhaps Amy and I had been coming down with something because now I seemed to be hearing things. Just as the worry began to subside my eyes locked on the small fridge under the counter with its door ajar.  #8220;Hmm #8221; I thought and gently nudged it closed with the tip of my shoe. It was at this moment my blood ran cold.  #8220;Hello? #8221; came a shakily elderly voice from behind me. It was one of those experiences where you are so afraid that time seems to slow down. I began turning in the direction of the voice extremely slowly, almost as if on some level I wasn #8217;t so eager to lock eyes with whoever was down here. I sighed again. Just the empty doorway. I decided I wanted to go back upstairs where the sanity seemed to be so I closed the staff room door and made my way back across the stockroom. Just as my hand gripped the door handle of the fire door total darkness enveloped me. It was so sudden that I couldn #8217;t help but unleash the unmanliest yelps I #8217;ve ever created. My hand instinctively fumbled for the light switch and toggled it on and off to no avail. The lighting was completely gone. Now retrospectively thinking, a normal person would have opened the door and ran upstairs, saying  #8220;ta ta #8221; to this fucked up situation but something caught my eye in the darkness. A light source. The light was emanating from under the staff room door again. This didn #8217;t sit right with me, a lot down here today didn #8217;t sit right with me. But in regards to the light, I knew how the electricity worked in the building. All lights on the basement level were connected at the fuse box. If one light goes, they all go. I #8217;m by no means an electrical engineer but I knew there was no way that light should be on. Now call it basic human curiosity or human stupidity but I found myself moving towards the light. Navigating around the crates until my hands were pressed against the wood panelling of the staff room door. I pushed it and to my total bewilderment I was greeting by one horrifying site. All the cupboards were open now, their doors yanked wide displaying the plates and cups within. Over on the far wall the coats and bags had come away from the wall hooks and lay crumpled on the carpet below in a pile. A newspaper I had got that morning during my morning commute which had been neatly folded on the staff room table was now open and the pages had been pulled out. I remember I almost couldn #8217;t breathe, it was a kind of terror I #8217;ve never experience before or since. I became instantly aware of how  #8230; alone I was down here.  #8220;Hello? #8221; I heard the voice again but this time closer than before. In fact this time it was right behind me. Now I #8217;m not sure if this is a coping mechanism of the human brain but I remember the complete inability to turn around and face the owner of this voice. I was aware of a presence directly behind me and knew only too well that if I had turned in that moment id have seen something that I #8217;d be describing to a therapist to this day. My body went cold, my hairs on the back of my neck were raised and I became aware of how annoyingly loud my heart beat was beating. I looked forward and noticed the bottom half of our small cordless telephone poking out from underneath one of the newspaper pages. The phone lets us make external and internal calls around the building. My hand slowly and shakily reached for it. Still feeling the presence behind me and the unwillingness to turn around I pressed  #8220;Int #8221; and  #8220;1 #8221; and instantly heard the faint sound of a phone ringing above me followed my footsteps moving from one side of the store to the other.  #8220;Yellooo #8221; Amy said amused.  #8220;Amy #8230; can you come down here please #8221; I whispered, my voice very slow and steady.  #8220; #8230;.. What #8217;s wrong? #8221; she asked.  #8220;Please just come here now #8221; I said this time with a hint of panic in my voice. The phone disconnected and I heard the footsteps sprinting across the ceiling above and then silence.  #8220;Hello? #8221; The voice sounded so frail and gravely now and I swear I could feel it stepping closer. Somehow being down here and going through this had made me ultra-aware in a way that I haven #8217;t been since. Just when I thought I was about to crawl under the table with my arms wrapped around my knees I heard the most amazing sound in the world.  #8220;Hey #8221; Amy said. I turned around to see a very concerned looking Amy.  #8220;Hey #8221; I whispered.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221; I nodded slowly.  #8220;I #8230; I just want to go upstairs. #8221; I whispered again. I felt her arm go around mine and she slowly escorted me out of the basement. A while after I remember saying to Amy that she was my Hero, that she saved me from quite possibly having a heart attack. She found the story interesting and would often ask me questions on what I think I would have saw if I had turned to face it. But I #8217;m fine not knowing what it looked like. I sometimes wonder why I had reacted the way I had, why did I feel such intense fear, was it my own insecurity and cowardice? Or had i sensed that I was in danger? Or was the voice even real at all? Perhaps I had simply imagined it? I think it #8217;s doubtful. I mean I didn #8217;t create the mess in the staff room and Amy had seen a women walk downstairs. I don #8217;t know, but I do know that I #8217;ll always remember this experience. It will be my one unexplainable story, I #8217;m pretty sure everybody has one and this is mine. It took a while before I was willing to go down to the basement alone and before I even had to get used to it I ended up finding the job of my dreams and so sadly I ended up having to say goodbye to my friends at the store. Thanks for taking the time to read my story.</TEXT>

Just as my hand gripped the door handle of the fire door total darkness enveloped me. It was so sudden that I couldn #8217;t help but unleash the unmanliest yelps I #8217;ve ever created. My hand instinctively fumbled for the light switch and toggled it on and off to no avail. The lighting was completely gone. Now retrospectively thinking, a normal person would have opened the door and ran upstairs, saying  #8220;ta ta #8221; to this fucked up situation but something caught my eye in the darkness. A light source. The light was emanating from under the staff room door again. This didn #8217;t sit right with me, a lot down here today didn #8217;t sit right with me. But in regards to the light, I knew how the electricity worked in the building. All lights on the basement level were connected at the fuse box. If one light goes, they all go. I #8217;m by no means an electrical engineer but I knew there was no way that light should be on. Now call it basic human curiosity or human stupidity but I found myself moving towards the light. Navigating around the crates until my hands were pressed against the wood panelling of the staff room door. I pushed it and to my total bewilderment I was greeting by one horrifying site. All the cupboards were open now, their doors yanked wide displaying the plates and cups within. Over on the far wall the coats and bags had come away from the wall hooks and lay crumpled on the carpet below in a pile. A newspaper I had got that morning during my morning commute which had been neatly folded on the staff room table was now open and the pages had been pulled out. I remember I almost couldn #8217;t breathe, it was a kind of terror I #8217;ve never experience before or since. I became instantly aware of how  #8230; alone I was down here.  #8220;Hello? #8221; I heard the voice again but this time closer than before. In fact this time it was right behind me. Now I #8217;m not sure if this is a coping mechanism of the human brain but I remember the complete inability to turn around and face the owner of this voice. I was aware of a presence directly behind me and knew only too well that if I had turned in that moment id have seen something that I #8217;d be describing to a therapist to this day. My body went cold, my hairs on the back of my neck were raised and I became aware of how annoyingly loud my heart beat was beating. I looked forward and noticed the bottom half of our small cordless telephone poking out from underneath one of the newspaper pages. The phone lets us make external and internal calls around the building. My hand slowly and shakily reached for it. Still feeling the presence behind me and the unwillingness to turn around I pressed  #8220;Int #8221; and  #8220;1 #8221; and instantly heard the faint sound of a phone ringing above me followed my footsteps moving from one side of the store to the other.  #8220;Yellooo #8221; Amy said amused.  #8220;Amy #8230; can you come down here please #8221; I whispered, my voice very slow and steady.  #8220; #8230;.. What #8217;s wrong? #8221; she asked.  #8220;Please just come here now #8221; I said this time with a hint of panic in my voice. The phone disconnected and I heard the footsteps sprinting across the ceiling above and then silence.  #8220;Hello? #8221; The voice sounded so frail and gravely now and I swear I could feel it stepping closer. Somehow being down here and going through this had made me ultra-aware in a way that I haven #8217;t been since. Just when I thought I was about to crawl under the table with my arms wrapped around my knees I heard the most amazing sound in the world.  #8220;Hey #8221; Amy said. I turned around to see a very concerned looking Amy.  #8220;Hey #8221; I whispered.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221; I nodded slowly.  #8220;I #8230; I just want to go upstairs. #8221; I whispered again. I felt her arm go around mine and she slowly escorted me out of the basement. A while after I remember saying to Amy that she was my Hero, that she saved me from quite possibly having a heart attack. She found the story interesting and would often ask me questions on what I think I would have saw if I had turned to face it. But I #8217;m fine not knowing what it looked like. I sometimes wonder why I had reacted the way I had, why did I feel such intense fear, was it my own insecurity and cowardice? Or had i sensed that I was in danger? Or was the voice even real at all? Perhaps I had simply imagined it? I think it #8217;s doubtful. I mean I didn #8217;t create the mess in the staff room and Amy had seen a women walk downstairs. I don #8217;t know, but I do know that I #8217;ll always remember this experience. It will be my one unexplainable story, I #8217;m pretty sure everybody has one and this is mine. It took a while before I was willing to go down to the basement alone and before I even had to get used to it I ended up finding the job of my dreams and so sadly I ended up having to say goodbye to my friends at the store. Thanks for taking the time to read my story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not specifically but I've read a lot of comments that refer to ALL the selections being not worthy of the contest. "This is a terrible list, I don't think any of these are even in the top 50 fo4 mods." or "This is a pretty BS selection if i'm honest" other forums were less kind with their wording. One thing that get's me is Nvidia have said they are mods that they choose, it's their personal list. You can't really dispute this. You can't tell people what they should think is the better mod. Even if my mod didn't make it i wouldn't care, i didn't create my mod to win a prize at the end i did it because it was so much fun to create.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Colleague i worked with for weeks is missing and nobody remember's her.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-16 22:14:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have spent the last few days thinking I've gone a little bat shit and I'm pretty sure the people I've questioned at work about this are thinking the same thing about me to. In August of this year I started at my new place of work as a suit adviser / tailor in a rather "prestigious" if not slightly pretentious clothing department store in the UK. In the last few month's I've grown to love the job and the people i work with but god i had a rough time during the induction phase. Although many people were friendly enough seeing a new face around the building there was this one women who acted as if she flat out resented me breathing in the same air as her. I remember clearly on my second day making the effort at small talk with her only for her to pretty much look at me like i was something she scraped off her boot. So i started giving her space and just got on with things and other people. A few weeks later she started to make the effort to communicate with me more, even becoming a lot nicer to me, initiating conversations, i even remember thinking "Wow the icy bitch actually has a sense of humour" Fast forward to the beginning of October and i started to notice this women was no longer present at our early morning team brief meetings. I just chalked this down to perhaps she had vacation time booked and I #8217;d see her in a week or two. It was only when i was going through my work rota yesterday that i noticed her name was no longer on the schedule list. Which was strange because this schedule was old #8230; it had been up since August and it had the names of every single person in our department written on its side margin. I then realised how long it had been seen i had seen her, almost a month ago! I began to wonder if maybe she had gone through some sort of loss and was on compassionate leave or maybe she had quietly resigned or maybe the company and discreetly  #8220;let her go #8221; without making any fuss. During one of the quieter periods at the store and when my curiosity was going into overdrive i made my way over to my manager and casually asked the whereabouts of this missing woman only for my boss to look at me a little off. There was a moment of silence until he said  #8220;Are you sure you don #8217;t have another job somewhere else? #8221; I laughed at this and told him to stop playing around and that he knew who I was talking about. You ever laugh at something someone #8217;s said and expect them to laugh with you and they don #8217;t? I instantly knew he was being serious in his response. I then proceeded to describe the women in detail, that she was blond, had a pony tail, about 5 #8217;9, had a slight limp when she walked which she told me was because she spent most of the day standing in heels which hurt like a bitch. I told him exactly where she worked in the store and how some late evenings me, her and another colleague  #8216;Alex #8217; would be the last ones working to close up. That #8217;s when he said the second thing to shock me.  #8220;The only people who do late nights, is you and Alex #8221; Just then almost as if on cue Alex turned into where we were talking. I asked him about the times me and him have closed the store with this other women and he also stared at me as if I had gone mad.  #8220;Only me and you have closed up #8230;.. What #8217;s wrong with you? #8221; I laughed again in a sort of  #8220;Okay I get it this is a joke Haha #8221; but nobody so much as smiled. I walked away from them both and went back to work and when I turned to look at them I could see they were both looking at me with concern on their faces and whispering. So that #8217;s that. I don #8217;t know where she has gone and nobody at the store seems to be missing her. What #8217;s also strange is #8230; yesterday morning I could have described her face to you in some detail. I remembered exactly what she looked like. But when I walked away from my boss and Alex her image in my mind #8217;s eye seemed to rapidly fade. How is that possible? A women I worked with for weeks disappeared from the store, nobody remembers her and now I #8217;m starting to forget her too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think if I'm honest, Michonne's story is the most bored I've ever been while editing. I had zero investment, but I have enjoyed both Batman and A New Frontier. I think telltale should just take that final step one day and eliminate player interaction completely and create animated movies instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you :) - It brought back so many memories, i miss games that have this level of detail and story in them. Only negative i could ever say about the game is the puzzles require quite a lot of 'out of the box' thinking. Back when i first played in high school i don't think i ever made it passed year 2.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Died at birth, brought back by unknown doctor who shared my rare name?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-03 07:46:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>***Warning graphic child birth information ahead*** So i'll give the condensed version of this but I'm currently 33 years old and living in the UK and ever since i was little my parents would often talk about how hard it was for me and my sisters to be born. Not the usual topic of conversation but usually the answer given when anyone asked my parents if they'd have any more children. I have two sisters, one older and one younger. My older sister was born breached and my mother had to have a C-section and so was my little sister. I was born the right way around but the trade off was i died during delivery. In 1983 when my mother was heavily pregnant with me she awoke in the middle of the night by my older sister who needed a drink of water. My mother often says it was strange because my sister at three years old never woke during the night. When mom was about to get up she noticed the bed felt wet and upon further investigation she saw an horrific sight. The bed was drenched in blood. My father remembers the drama quite vividly. "We had a two ambulance escort to the hospital that night and when we brought you home everyone was surprised... people who saw that bed thought you were already gone" When arriving at the hospital doctors told my father that the bag that carries the baby and usually comes out after had detached and come out before me. So in effect... i was drowning in the womb. My mum pushed when instructed and i was pulled out by one of the doctors. Completely blue and quiet. My dad says that there was blood everywhere, in my eyes, nose... everywhere. A nurse present took me to a side table away from my father and said there was no heartbeat and called for another doctor. My dad over heard a responding nurse say that a certain doctor was off duty and called in someone else. The man in a white coat who arrived at the door had a name badge donning my family surname. My dad was taken back because our family name is quite rare. Only a small number of us lived in the UK according to the census and being a small town it would have been hard for this guy to exist and for us not to know of him. He took control immediately and started cleaning my airways and after what felt like eternity to my father and to much relief of the nurses a cry was heard. Dad says the colour change was almost instant from blue to pink. I was passed to my father as doctors were now concerned with my mother. She'd lost a lot of blood and as it turns out me and my mother have a very rare blood type. Rh O Negative. Turns out this had something to do with why her body started "rejecting me" a month early. The doctor who got my heart going approached my father and asked what he was going to name me. My Dad said "Gareth". The doctor looked at the board at my mothers bed and said "Gareth...*****s?" and my dad nodded. The doctor smiled again and said "That's my name". The doctor left the room and was gone. The next morning while my mother held me my father asked a nurse if they could speak to the doctor again as they wished to thank him. But sadly nobody could track this guy down. He had signed in as "relief" and didn't sign out. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Added information from questions asked:*** ***ehco said:*** "you already know what his name is! Being a practising doctor means he'll be listed online - google yourself, op, and let us know!!!!!!" ***Reply*** - A number of times over the years I have done numerous searches online, even checking linked in and sites such as RateMD and there is currently no doctor in The UK with my surname. ***neatoqueen asked:*** "curious question! when your parents recalled this event to you, did it feel familiar? obviously, no one can remember being born, but, when you imagine the scene in your head, does it feel like, to you, that you were there "observing" it happen so to speak?" ***Reply*** - No, not at all. When they've relayed the story to me it might as well have happened to someone else. My earliest memories are of about 4 years old. ***cy_guy said:*** "your doctor was you from the future coming to save yourself You are a time traveller, best get ready." ***Reply*** - Haha god i hope not, this version of me currently has no medical expertise.</TEXT>

So I thought being as it was he 80s chances are he moved abroad? But not even broadening the search or narrowing it down to pediatric doctors returns results. I found one doctor over in the states in philedelphia who had my surname as his first name but that's it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What i find curious is, the further along we humans travel down this evolutionary road, the more we learn about technology and artificial environments thanks to video game, simulators, VR. You start to see patterns that translate over into our real world. I remember seeing a TED talk where a scientist mentioned if you zoom in far enough on the microscopic level the universe is made out of code. I believe our reality is a simulation. I think we enter, experience then leave. I don't think the people i meet are NPCs or in some way artificial, just other people playing this "game " and having read what i just wrote i really need to lay off the weed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Saw a bird bigger than a dog.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-09 11:32:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i wrote a true glitch in the matrix story last week and after taking the time to read so many other peoples glitches i tried again to recall anything else from my past that was out of the ordinary in some way. It wasn't long before i recollected something me and a friend saw on our way to school back in 1996. I grew up in a small welsh village in the UK called Llanrumney. Our school was sort of on the outskirts of the village closer to the city of Cardiff. Every morning me and a friend would walk to school but boys being boys we'd try and find the most pointless, longest and possibly dangerous route to school possible. This ended up with us entering the woods via public footpath, then leaving the path and walking through the forest following the Rhymney River. In the early mornings around winter i remember the river would always have this eerie mist along it's banks which added to the creepy atmosphere. So there we were, two school lads in their harry potter style uniforms following a river to school when suddenly my friend stopped in his tracks and put his hand up to stop me walking into him. When i followed his gaze off to the right in the river i saw it. You ever see something your mind, even at 11 knows should not be there? i just stayed perfectly still for what felt like hours just watching this creature plunge its huge beak into the rushing water then rotating its giant head back to his wings. This was a bird that was bigger than anything i'd seen on annual school trips to the zoo. Think of the largest dog you've seen. You probably think something along the lines of a great dane, well imagine that but twice as big. After a few more minutes of watching this thing bathe me and my friend quietly walked away leaving it in the river. We saw it often, at the exact same time in the exact same spot every day. We didn't tell many people about it because whenever we did and they'd walk to school with us it was never there. So naturally our friends thought we were making it all up. I saw it one last time in the summer of 1997. I was walking to school by myself and this time i didn't just see it clean, i saw this thing take off. I have to tell you when you see a bird that size flex its wingspan... i genuinely felt a little scared. But that's it, i never saw it again and me and my friend have never really spoken about it but i'll always remember it. Obviously over the years I've done research trying to locate the breed of this bird but I've never been able to find what i saw. Thanks for taking the time to read this - Gaz</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Ghost in Retail</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-11 13:32:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>This happened to me about five years ago while I had the  #8220;privilege #8221; of working in a men #8217;s suit store while studying at a college in Cardiff, Wales. For anyone who is curious Wales sits just left of England and directly right of Ireland. Cardiff is a nice city, nowhere near as big as England but it has gone through some pretty rapid modernisation of late. They #8217;ve done a great job at keeping their historic architecture but there always seems to be a new Starbucks or Costa Coffee opening up every other week. Some of the buildings in the city center have shiny new facades that wrap around the ancient structures like a shell. This became more evident to me on my first day at the store. My interview for the job took place bright and early one February morning and I remember how cold I was as I made my way passed the hustle and bustle of early morning commuters. Having been a student for year I wasn #8217;t used to being around so many people this early in the morning. That being said I wasn #8217;t really used to being up in the morning period. When I arrived a good fifteen minutes before my interview was due to start I was greeted by an immaculate looking man in a pin stripe suit who I quickly recognised to be my new potential boss. His name was Andrew, he was a friendly guy in his mid-fifties, silver grey hair and just looked how you expect a manager of a suit store to look. After greeting me he took me down to the bowels of the building where the staff room was located. We had to make our way down two flights of stairs and through a hallway full of your standard retail fixtures. I remember almost having a heart attack when turning a corner and coming face to face with a naked mannequin just standing there with its hands on its hips defiantly.  #8220;Ah sorry about that, I stripped it yesterday as we needed the garment for another display upstairs, not very modest is he #8221; Andrew said lightly with a chuckle. I laughed too. I felt comfortable before the interview had begun, this guy had a sense of humour. When we entered the main stock room I was a little blown away. The walls, ceiling and flooring were completely different to upstairs. They weren #8217;t just bricks but old carved bricks. The only thing I can compare it to off the top of my head would be something that resembles catacombs. Big archways hug over head in badly eroded red stone and the tiles beneath our feet were a dark marble. Andrew, upon seeing my wondering eyes began to speak again.  #8220;Ah yes I forget people are usually surprised when they walk in here, I guess I #8217;m used to it  #8220; he opened a wooden door that lead into a posh looking staff room complete with carpeted floor, a polished oak table and a brown leather couch.  #8220;What I found amazing was when I learnt the basement down here as well as the basements in all the neighbouring buildings all look the same, they were once part of a Victorian tunnel you see, that connected every building in the street. Some kind of evacuation tunnel #8221; Andrew finished and indicated for me to take a seat. Two years later I had finished my course in college and had been asked by Andrew if I wanted a full time position while I figured out what my next step was going to be. Naturally I accepted as I really did love the job and the people I worked with had become like family to me. Life being the way it was I found myself struggling to find jobs that although I was now qualified for, lacked the  #8220;experience in a similar field #8221; it was infuriating, how could I have experience if nobody will give me a break? Another two years after becoming a full time member of staff I was still at the store but I had managed to progress from  #8216;Part Time Sales Assistant #8217; to  #8216;Assistant Manager #8217; which was great for me as it meant a tasty pay rise and great for Andrew as it meant he could finally take more time off, take vacations and be with his family. I actually really began to enjoy the extra responsibility, training new staff, delegating jobs and helping our team to hit sales targets. We are now coming to the reason I am writing this. The reason I will never forget that place. It all went down one Sunday Morning. Sunday #8217;s obviously being the quieter days of trade only required a  #8216;skeleton crew #8217; to run the Store. This is usually a manager (me) and one other sales assistant (in this case a girl named Amy). I quite liked working with Amy, we were of similar ages, she was cute and really down to earth. Most of our quiet periods were spent talking about everything and anything about our lives until we realised how much time had passed and began creating jobs to do out of guilt. One Sunday afternoon after a pretty uneventful morning I walked into our office just off the shop floor to email our sales figures to head office while Amy manned the front desk. As we had two sales floors (upstairs was suits and downstairs was accessories / shoes) if someone went downstairs either Amy or myself would have to go with them. One of our rules was that under no circumstances were customers to walk around downstairs unattended. As I began entering figures into a new excel spreadsheet I heard Amy #8217;s faint voice under the store #8217;s collection of non-threatening store music. If my memory serves me correctly I believe it was Nickelback she was quite rudely interrupting. I reached for the knob of the Hifi and turned down the volume.  #8220; #8230;. Want me to go? #8221; Amy called. I poked my head out of the office door.  #8220;Sorry what? #8221;  #8220;An elderly lady just went downstairs would you like me to go down? Or do you want me to watch the shop floor and you go down? #8221; I looked back at the barely started spreadsheet and then back to Amy.  #8220;Its fine I #8217;ll go, maybe I can sell her a sports jacket and cufflinks #8221; I said with a smile.  #8220;Oh do it! #8221; Amy giggled as I walked passed her. As I made my way down the steps to the ground floor I was surprised to find that nobody was there. The room looked pristine and untouched. I took a few steps forward and stretched my neck looking along the rows of formal jackets.  #8220;Amy? #8221; I called up stairs. I heard her shuffle along from the till to the doorway.  #8220;Yello? #8221; she asked.  #8220;I thought you said there was a lady down here? #8221; I asked quickly glancing back at the room.  #8220;There is #8230; I watched her go down myself #8221; she said again confidently. I walked the full length of the room, passed the shoe displays to the changing rooms and back.  #8220;Nope, no one here #8230; are you seeing things? #8221; I asked. Amy looked both confused and annoyed.  #8220;What? Can I come down? #8221; she asked.  #8220;Yes but quickly #8221; I watched as she made her way around the room and back.  #8220;What the fuck #8230;. #8221; She uttered under her breath while pulling back the curtains of the changing room.  #8220;See just like I said, you #8217;re seeing things #8221;  #8220;I swear to god this is freaky #8230; I literally watched her enter the store at the entrance, the doorbell even chimed, I smiled at her and she just walked down here #8221; Amy finished. I noticed that colour seemed to be fading from her usually rosy cheeks. Just then I had a sinking feeling.  #8220;What if she #8217;s gone down into the basement? #8221; I asked eyebrows raised. Amy put her hand to her mouth in a  #8220;oh fuck #8221; fashion.  #8220;Ugh what if she #8217;s senile or something and just went down there? Did she acknowledge you when you smiled at her? #8221; I questioned. Amy #8217;s eyes looked upwards in thought before returning to me.  #8220;She didn #8217;t #8230; I thought she was just being rude. #8221;  #8220;Okay, go back upstairs I #8217;ll go find her #8221; I said a little exasperated. I really wasn #8217;t looking forward to this part of the job. One thing I learned from working in the fabulous world of retail is you often meet people from both sides of the mental health spectrum. My second week working at the store some guy politely used one of our changing rooms to try on a shirt and in doing so took it upon himself to urinate into the small trash can in there. Guess which rookie member of the team has the pleasure of fixing this problem? As I entered the basement level the first thing to hit me was the void of total darkness. Funny thing about wondering around in the dark, you usually have some sort of natural light so you can at least see your hand in front of your face. But here, deep underground if the lights were off you were pretty much Completely blind. My hand went to my left and frantically felt for the switch and with a sigh of relief I flicked it back. The florescent tube light bulbs flickered into existence for a few moments before bursting light to all corners of the basement and as my eyes adjusted I quickly scanned around.  #8220;Nobody #8221; I said with relief. The basement stockroom was quiet and untouched and also a complete mess. It was all of our jobs to keep the stockroom tidy but over the weeks of constant deliveries it had become more or less a dumping ground with crates stacked on top of each other. Another reason to not wanting to be wondering around here in the dark. As I began to turn back to the door while thinking how it was going to be my sad duty to inform one of my colleagues #8217; that she #8217;s been hallucinating. I distinctly heard the sound of a refrigerator door closing. I quickly turned to the direction of the staff room. The door was closed but the light from within seeped through the gap under the door. My heart began to race. The old lady was here #8230; she must have somehow navigated her way through the stock room in the dark and was now making herself at home in our staff room, probably attempting to make herself a nice cup of tea perhaps. Without really thinking I marched forward and pushed the door open. I was greeting with an empty staff room. The bags and coats hung neatly on peg hooks on the far wall, cutlery lay strewn around the draining board and a dirty washrag was lazily dumped on top of them (my bad). I remember thinking that perhaps Amy and I had been coming down with something because now I seemed to be hearing things. Just as the worry began to subside my eyes locked on the small fridge under the counter with its door ajar.  #8220;Hmm #8221; I thought and gently nudged it closed with the tip of my shoe. It was at this moment my blood ran cold.  #8220;Hello? #8221; came a shakily elderly voice from behind me. It was one of those experiences where you are so afraid that time seems to slow down. I began turning in the direction of the voice extremely slowly, almost as if on some level I wasn #8217;t so eager to lock eyes with whoever was down here. I sighed again. Just the empty doorway. I decided I wanted to go back upstairs where the sanity seemed to be so I closed the staff room door and made my way back across the stockroom. Just as my hand gripped the door handle of the fire door total darkness enveloped me. It was so sudden that I couldn #8217;t help but unleash the unmanliest yelps I #8217;ve ever created. My hand instinctively fumbled for the light switch and toggled it on and off to no avail. The lighting was completely gone. Now retrospectively thinking, a normal person would have opened the door and ran upstairs, saying  #8220;ta ta #8221; to this fucked up situation but something caught my eye in the darkness. A light source. The light was emanating from under the staff room door again. This didn #8217;t sit right with me, a lot down here today didn #8217;t sit right with me. But in regards to the light, I knew how the electricity worked in the building. All lights on the basement level were connected at the fuse box. If one light goes, they all go. I #8217;m by no means an electrical engineer but I knew there was no way that light should be on. Now call it basic human curiosity or human stupidity but I found myself moving towards the light. Navigating around the crates until my hands were pressed against the wood panelling of the staff room door. I pushed it and to my total bewilderment I was greeting by one horrifying site. All the cupboards were open now, their doors yanked wide displaying the plates and cups within. Over on the far wall the coats and bags had come away from the wall hooks and lay crumpled on the carpet below in a pile. A newspaper I had got that morning during my morning commute which had been neatly folded on the staff room table was now open and the pages had been pulled out. I remember I almost couldn #8217;t breathe, it was a kind of terror I #8217;ve never experience before or since. I became instantly aware of how  #8230; alone I was down here.  #8220;Hello? #8221; I heard the voice again but this time closer than before. In fact this time it was right behind me. Now I #8217;m not sure if this is a coping mechanism of the human brain but I remember the complete inability to turn around and face the owner of this voice. I was aware of a presence directly behind me and knew only too well that if I had turned in that moment id have seen something that I #8217;d be describing to a therapist to this day. My body went cold, my hairs on the back of my neck were raised and I became aware of how annoyingly loud my heart beat was beating. I looked forward and noticed the bottom half of our small cordless telephone poking out from underneath one of the newspaper pages. The phone lets us make external and internal calls around the building. My hand slowly and shakily reached for it. Still feeling the presence behind me and the unwillingness to turn around I pressed  #8220;Int #8221; and  #8220;1 #8221; and instantly heard the faint sound of a phone ringing above me followed my footsteps moving from one side of the store to the other.  #8220;Yellooo #8221; Amy said amused.  #8220;Amy #8230; can you come down here please #8221; I whispered, my voice very slow and steady.  #8220; #8230;.. What #8217;s wrong? #8221; she asked.  #8220;Please just come here now #8221; I said this time with a hint of panic in my voice. The phone disconnected and I heard the footsteps sprinting across the ceiling above and then silence.  #8220;Hello? #8221; The voice sounded so frail and gravely now and I swear I could feel it stepping closer. Somehow being down here and going through this had made me ultra-aware in a way that I haven #8217;t been since. Just when I thought I was about to crawl under the table with my arms wrapped around my knees I heard the most amazing sound in the world.  #8220;Hey #8221; Amy said. I turned around to see a very concerned looking Amy.  #8220;Hey #8221; I whispered.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221; I nodded slowly.  #8220;I #8230; I just want to go upstairs. #8221; I whispered again. I felt her arm go around mine and she slowly escorted me out of the basement. A while after I remember saying to Amy that she was my Hero, that she saved me from quite possibly having a heart attack. She found the story interesting and would often ask me questions on what I think I would have saw if I had turned to face it. But I #8217;m fine not knowing what it looked like. I sometimes wonder why I had reacted the way I had, why did I feel such intense fear, was it my own insecurity and cowardice? Or had i sensed that I was in danger? Or was the voice even real at all? Perhaps I had simply imagined it? I think it #8217;s doubtful. I mean I didn #8217;t create the mess in the staff room and Amy had seen a women walk downstairs. I don #8217;t know, but I do know that I #8217;ll always remember this experience. It will be my one unexplainable story, I #8217;m pretty sure everybody has one and this is mine. It took a while before I was willing to go down to the basement alone and before I even had to get used to it I ended up finding the job of my dreams and so sadly I ended up having to say goodbye to my friends at the store. Thanks for taking the time to read my story.</TEXT>

Each Episode was like a chapter just as you described. When i realised that hardly anyone was watching i decided to "clear up clutter" in my channel by removing the episodes and assembling them into one tighter full movie. Also you don't have to watch all 8 hours in one sitting lol. The video will usually resume whenever you decide to play it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really sympathise but i'll never add subtitles to my movies purely because you can't disable them once they're on the video. Also when i edit i'm often cropping certain things out of frames so some scenes would have the subtitiles missing. I'd add subtitles to lets plays but when making a movie i'm trying to clear the screen as much as possible. Youtube does have a close caption option that seems to be getting better if that helps :(.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I get you, I used drive myself crazy going to lengths to clear away as much of the interface as possible but decided I was making it look worse than if I were to just leave the QuickTime buttons in. With telltale games only I leave the fight scenes un-edited. Oh and the only reason I get a small fraction more views is because I #8217;ve been at this for 7 years lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Back in 2012 I had a lucid dream that I was in my city and everyone around me was suffocating. Probably one of the most messed up dreams I #8217;ve ever had, but I even remember how the  #8220;air tasted #8221; as it burned my throat and lungs and everyone panicking. Last thing I remember is reading on my phone that earths atmosphere was being stripped away. After I awoke I was shaken and slowly but surely started to hear about ME #8217;s and sometimes I #8217;m just not sure it was a dream after all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 19 I started to feel really low energy, I gained weight without eating much, rashes started appearing over my body more so in my abdominal and stomach regions where the skin was cracking. I had a condition called  #8220;cushions syndrome #8221; that I had due to a malfunctioning gland. I had checks at the time which involved ultra sounds and CT Scans to make sure it wasn #8217;t a tumour that was making the the gland act up (thankfully it wasn #8217;t) in the end I was told it was a condition I would simply have to manage. Flash forward to 2015 and I started to loose all my weight and the pain disappeard, it was like an over night change. I checked my body to find the red scars were gone. When I spoke to my doctor about it he said according to my record I never had cushion syndrome. To which I laughed. Told him I had scans and tests over the years to which he said there was no record of those ether.</TEXT>

As for another version of this video with different responses... I don #8217;t think I have it in me lol. It #8217;s an amazing game and story but when you play and edit footage it #8217;s like going through the story twice. So yeah the DLC video will be up sometime in November :) I #8217;ll be sure to link it here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember reading up on it a couple of years ago and the line of thought they used was if you picked up a revolver, stuck one bullet in the chamber and spun it Russian roulette style and pulled the trigger. From your point of view you'l never reach a point of shooting yourself, you will always get an empty chamber. To observers however they will have the misfortune of they seeing you shoot yourself in the head and die. But you're continuously shifting realities. For me it makes a little sense. If the goal of life is you're here to learn then your life is too precious to waste. So naturally there would be a contingency plan (quantum immortality)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won't pretend to be an expert but over the years i've read a lot of books such as "The Demonologist" by Ed Warren where they describe how there is much more in this world than we see. Dark entities can be negative spirits or in rare cases even an actual demon who enjoy nothing better than to kick a human when they're down. Some can feed on your emotional energy like a leach. I do think these encounters are rare though, key is to stay positive and if shit like that ever happens again don't give it any attention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing i found as I've gotten older is that your perception of time does indeed change with age. Being in my early 30's i find that a year can go by in a blink of an eye where as in my early 20's time seemed to go at a snails pace. I remember reading a paper once where research had gone into this and your age does play an important role. For example when you're 20 you'l feel like the last 10 years behind you was a heck of a long time. That's because it was half of your life span at that time. In regards to the simulated universe theory and Mandela Effects I feel that is an entirely separate but disturbing issue. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-time-seem-to-speed-up-with-age/</TEXT>

    <TITLE>JFK Mandela Effect - 4 seat Lincoln vs 6 Seat</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-11 14:23:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Out of all of the different Mandela Effects that have come to light over the last couple of years the biggest one for me is in regards to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. When i was in high school back in the late 1990s each class we took in our final year gave us an assignment to do. The assignment was important because it contributed to your final grade upon graduation. In history i decided to do a report of JFK. I wanted to write about the sort of man he was as well as a president. Back in those days the internet was still fairly new and google non-existent so i decided it best to visit the School's library and check out the encyclopedia which came on a swanky CD ROM. The moment i typed in JFK into the search bar my school computer screen was full of pictures, texts, Sound bites of the president talking and pictures of a 4 Seat Lincoln Car. I was surprised to find it also included a grainy quicktime video of the president's last moments. I remember it as the president being hit, reaching for his neck and slumping down, the driver looking back to the president briefly and then an explosion as the president was no more. I remembering being almost traumatised by what my young mind was seeing. I remember for days after not being able to get the images out of my head, images of Jackie Kennedy crawling towards the back end of the Lincoln and all hell breaking loose. Fast forward a few years and i remember seeing a conspiracy video online that suggested that the driver, upon seeing Kennedy was still alive after the first shot fired a pistol from underneath his own arm. The video was slowed down and analysed. I didn't buy into the theory. Fast forward to now and seeing this 6 seat Lincoln driving through Dallas carrying an extra two occupants between the Kennedys and the driver just really screws with my mind. For one the car just looks wrong, its not the car i remember from those old quicktime videos. Also how could the driver in that conspiracy video fire a gun with another man sitting right behind him in the way of the president? Out of all the Mandela Effects this is the one that bother's me the most because of how much time I contributed to the facts of that day. Does anyone else remember the 4 Seat Lincoln or the conspiracy video?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perhaps you need to see it in the context of the movie, as Ben starts reading the disturbing history of Derry, the music intensifies and the old lady who before was casually searching the bookshelf starts walking towards Ben and the camera. Then when the music intensifies even more she starts to have a sinister smile / sneer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah i agree, the new movie did a great job with subtle hints that something was wrong with the adults. I remember the book being a bit more in your face with it, like the massacre at the The Sleepy Silver Dollar where a man started hacking up patrons with an axe while the rest of the pub casually drank their beers.</TEXT>

But what throws a spanner into that theory is what was the whole closet door not opening thing about...Might be worth seeking out a hypnotist one day, perhaps see if you can be regressed to that week, just for answers and closure.

    <TEXT>When i was young my grandfather would sit me down and tell me stories of WW2, he was a British paratrooper. When he noticed I was really interested he gave me books to read and I couldn #8217;t get enough, partly because I love history but more so that I have a need to understand human behaviour. Why, as humans do we have the capacity for such cruelty. I #8217;ve read so many testimonies from holocaust survivors and it hurts my heart every time. To loose so much. I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll ever understand how it was allowed to happen. I understand how compartilisaion works and how many nazi soldiers claimed they were only doing  #8220;their jobs #8221; or  #8220;following orders #8221; but surely there had to be some who realised the extent of what they were apart of?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A devastating mine explosion that I have no memory of.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-05 03:53:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Back in 2013 I had my first unexplainable discrepancy happen. I live in a small village in South Wales, UK and history was always my favourite subject growing up. One day as I was getting ready for work my partner mentioned that it was an anniversary of some mine explosion disaster that happened a hundred years prior, back when my village was a mining village and coal was all the rage. I laughed, suddenly feeling like my old lady had gone a little funny. As I said it #8217;s a small village, history is well known and well taught here, she might as well have said something like  #8220;it #8217;s the anniversary of the nazi #8217;s winning WW2 #8221; I turned on the TV and sure enough there it was on BBC Wales, some old guy sitting opposite an interviewer showing old black and white newspaper prints all about the disaster. How the explosion took out 439 miners in an instant, families losing fathers and sons, the whole village becoming full of widows in one morning. It was heartbreaking to see. I told my partner that I had no recollection of this happening and she looked at me as if I was the weird one.  #8220;We walk past the memorial every time we walk the dogs? #8221; She took me down the road and there it was, this big black cylindrical monument with names of all the people who perished. Id never seen this memorial before. Till this day she still believes I #8217;m winding her up, she can #8217;t fathom how I could forget such a big part of our village #8217;s history. But I #8217;d never heard about it, never heard anyone speak of it until that morning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How the area looked before the monument was erected (pre 2006) is how it always looked until that day in 2013. I mean for me at least. I remember thinking that surely i would have noticed an unavailing of this memorial back in 2006, i was very close to the area at the time. I don't know, i think the only reason I've managed to deal with all of this is by flat out ignoring it and just getting on with things. I mean I know i'm not that ignorant. I knew the history of my village (or so i thought), i knew about near by similar mine disasters. I spoke to my father about it and he was just as surprised. Asked how could i forget something that took out so many of my ancestors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the compliment and the feedback :). I see where you're coming from with regard to the "quiet scenes" and i'll be honest during the edit i was reminded of a few of your videos that i watched where it totally works great. But i'm always mindful of what the particular "vibe" was that dontnod were going for with certain scenes. Like sometimes the quiet scenes are quiet for a reason, its almost like a reality moment where something serious is being discussed. When i'm done with the final episode i'll be putting them all together into a "super movie" so i can take a second look at adding possible music to certain scenes if necessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sound like a dumb question I know but I had a dream last night where I became lucid and started walking around this office building. As I was walking up a set of stairs I was passing people on various landings, people I didn #8217;t recognise and were only too happy to greet me with a smile or a nod. As I made my way up further I was looking down from time to time over the banister to see these people moving off the landing and then through various doors. I paused aware this was a dream, and slowly made my way back down and peered through one of the doors to see these people just standing there frozen in spot. Almost as if they were character NPCs in a video game that #8217;s run their course and has now shut down. I inspected these  #8220;statues #8221; and they slowly started to dissolve, as they went transparent and vanished.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay this post legit gave me chills o.O, Like a few people already mentioned the only logical explanations for what happened would be if you got off earlier at a different store. But it sounds like you repeated this journey multiple times a week (For work) you even mentioned how you always shoped at that specific store. I'd say this is a classic glitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm by no means an expert in such things but has it ever crossed your mind that they might not be imaginary? Maybe you simply have an extra sense that most of us do not have. A 6th sense that allows you to see people that the rest of us can not. I mean that would account for the fact that some of them had more knowledge than you about certain things. They could be getting more clear and defined as you get older because your sense is getting stronger. I dont think its something to worry about really. They dont seem to be affecting your life in a negative way. Thanks for the post</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear ya, I've even seen some versions of this surpass the 10 hour mark lol. This is actually pretty edit heavy, There are no scenes where a character is aimlessly wondering around, loading screens are gone, its pretty much "A to B" fast paced. Cutting it down to 2 hours possibly sacrifices too much i feel, you have three characters each with their own movie length worth of content.</TEXT>
