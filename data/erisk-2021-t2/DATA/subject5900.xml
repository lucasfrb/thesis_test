    <DATE>2016-04-08 17:51:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>**SOLVED:** Turning fast boot off in the Control Panel's Power Settings got rid of the problem. **Original post:** So basically, none of my boot keys are working anymore after the latest update (Version 1511, OS Build 10586.164). I can't boot into BIOS through F10 or show the boot menu through ESC. Before, when I booted up the laptop, it displayed the HP logo for a while and in the bottom left corner it said "Press ESC for boot menu". Now this text has disappeared and pressing ESC does nothing. None of the function keys work either. My laptop is a HP 635. How can I access BIOS again? Or my boot menu (where I could choose to boot from USB or CD, for example)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can't restore GRUB2 via Boot-Repair-Disk</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-13 15:58:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>**SOLVED:** After trying out many different solutions and failed with them, I happened to find an old boot info summary of mine. There I found the `menuentry` I had had before, and **copied it manually to** `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`. Then I rebooted and could see the entry for Fedora 23 again. **Original post:** I have a dual-boot laptop (BIOS) with Windows 10  amp; Fedora 23 in it. I recently updated Windows 10 which somehow resulted in my GRUB boot menu disappearing; the laptop now boots straight into Windows 10. So I installed Boot-Repair-Disk (which uses Lubuntu 14.04) on my USB drive and booted from it. After running the Recommended Repair, I get an error message:  gt; **Please enable a repository containing the [grub2] packages in the software sources of Fedora release 23 (Twenty (mapper/fedora-root). Then try again.** I have all repositories enabled in **/etc/apt/sources.list**, though. I tried updating grub2, but the Boot-Repair-Disk media already has the newest version of it. I also tried removing the package and redownloading it, still the same error message. Here is the boot info summary: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15813468/ Any help here?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-06-04 22:26:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Back in the day I was playing NES games on a modded PS1, and one of them was a game where I think you had to somehow knock out computer players in a room that had a floor with flippable tiles. There might have been some mechanics which let you slide from the room's side to the other side and so on, the point was to use the tiles to beat the computer players. I remember that the rooms (stages) were very colorful and I *think* that the players were young kids. You had to get rid of all of them to clear the room. The game had catchy music. Can't really remember anything else. :/</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Guide] How to bypass SafetyNet  amp; Error 803-3001 (Android)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-07 09:46:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>FE: Heroes uses Google's SafetyNet API, which checks your device's integrity; in other words, it checks if your device has been "tampered with or otherwise modified". This API is used for example in Android Pay, some banking apps and Pok #233;mon GO. For Heroes, the purpose is most probably to block any kind of cheating in the game. If your device does not pass this check, the game won't even show up in Google Play when you search for it. You will get the error in the game after some time has passed after the initial installation. Now, some people may have encountered this error even if they haven't modified their phone in any way. Why? Because some devices (especially Chinese brands) have *already* been set up in the manufacturing process in a way that Google does not find OK. [There's also apparently a known bug](https://serenesforest.net/forums/index.php?/topic/68725-fe-heroes-error-803-3001/ amp;do=findComment amp;comment=4701696) that causes the error code even for devices that pass SafetyNet. It is unknown if this bug has been fixed. For those who know that their device is modifed, here are some things you can try to get around SafetyNet: --- #I don't need root or Xposed ####Removing root: 1. Install the latest SuperSU from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu) (or [APKMirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/chainfire/supersu/), if you can't access Play), if you don't already have it. 2. If you get prompts when launching the app, **ignore/cancel them**. 3. Go to settings, scroll down to the "Full unroot" option and tap it. 4. Press continue, wait until it's done. 5. Reboot. ####Removing Xposed: **Method I  #8211; Recovery mode** 1. Download the latest Xposed uninstaller .zip from [here](http://dl-xda.xposed.info/framework/uninstaller/). 2. Flash the .zip in your device's recovery mode. 3. Reboot. **Method II  #8211; Xposed Installer** 1. Install the Xposed Installer .apk from [here](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer) (Android 4.0.3 #8212;4.4) or [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811) (Android 5.0/5.1/6.0), if you don't already have it. 2. Find the tab that has your version of Xposed. 3. Press the uninstall button, confirm. 4. Wait until it's done. 5. Reboot. Still not passing? Make sure that your SELinux is set to **enforcing** (you can check this from Settings  #8594; About phone  #8594; SELinux status). Permissive SELinux is known to trigger SafetyNet. You may need to use a different ROM/kernel with enforcing SELinux. Also, make sure you don't have any `su` binaries left in `/system/bin` or `/system/xbin`. #I want to keep root ####Method I  #8211; Magisk (**Android 5.0+**) **I have systemless SuperSU:** 1. Do a full unroot (steps above) 2. Download the latest Magisk .zip from [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445). 3. Flash the .zip in your device's recovery mode. 4. Reboot. 5. Install Magisk Manager ~~from Google Play~~ (removed from Google Play as of June 1st) from [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445=). 6. Go to the Settings section, enable Magisk Hide. 7. Go to the Magisk Hide section, find FE: Heroes on the list and tick the checkbox. **I don't have systemless SuperSU:** 1. Install Magisk Manager from Google Play (or from [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445), if you can't access Play). 2. Go to the Settings section, enable Magisk Hide. 2. Go to the Install section, default settings should be fine. 3. Tap Magiskify, choose "download  amp; install". 4. Wait until it's done. 5. Reboot. 6. Go to the Magisk Hide section, find FE: Heroes on the list and tick the checkbox. If you don't know if you have systemless SuperSU or not, install Magisk Manager. It will tell you if you have it in the Status section. In the installation process, Magisk will automatically remove any existing root solutions and replace them with MagiskSU  #8211; unless you have systemless SuperSU, in which case Magisk will use it instead. But Magisk Hide only works with MagiskSU, so SuperSU first needs to be uninstalled. After installing Magisk, you won't need any external root manager apps you might have (like SuperSU or Superuser); Magisk Manager has a built-in superuser manager. ####Method II  #8211; Root Switch (**Android 4.4+**) 1. Install the Root Switch 1.3.3.2 .apk from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_N7f-cXJ8-HSDNqbzdfVEJrZU0) (official thread is [here](https://www.asus.com/zentalk/tw/thread-173542-1-1.html), but I copied the file to Drive to save people from registering to the site). 2. Enable "Stop all su daemons"  amp; "Toggle USB debugging". 3. Toggle root off. Make sure to turn root on again whenever you're not playing the game  #8211; you may lose root if you have it turned off when you reboot your device! --- #I want to keep Xposed Only for **Android 6.0+**. This method is unstable and is known to cause bootloops sometimes. There seems to be problems especially if your system's security patches are from November or later (you can check this from Settings  #8594; About phone  #8594; Android security patch level). Proceed with caution. ####1  #8211; Installing suhide 1. Uninstall any Xposed version you may have on your device currently (steps above). 2. Download the latest suhide  amp; Xposed v86.2 by topjohnwu from [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/supersu/suhide-t3450396). 3. In your device's recovery mode, flash the suhide .zip, then the Xposed .zip. 4. Reboot (and hope for the best). ####2  #8211; Blacklisting the game: 1. Open [a terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yarolegovich.materialterminal) of your choice and get root rights with the `su` command. You can also use the terminal in your recovery mode, if available. 2. Get the UID of FE: Heroes with the command `ls -nld /data/data/com.nintendo.zaba`. The UID is the second number displayed, usually in this format: 10xxx. 3. Add FE: Heroes to suhide's blacklist with the command `su/suhide/add UID` (replace `UID` with the number you got with the previous command). 4. Reboot. OR 1. Install [this GUI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loserskater.suhidegui) from Google Play (or from [GitHub](https://github.com/loserskater/suhide-GUI/releases), if you can't access Play). 2. Find FE: Heroes from the list and tick the checkbox. 3. Reboot. And for all steps: remember to grant superuser rights whenever prompted. ------ If you can't pass SafetyNet after these steps, it may be that your kernel does not hide an unlocked bootloader, which is known to trigger SafetyNet. You may need to switch to a different kernel. The most popular ROM, LineageOS, is known to not hide the bootloader status, since they want to comply with Google's security policies. Removing `deviceAccount:.xml` from `/data/data/com.nintendo.zaba/shared_prefs/` or reinstalling the game also gets around the error, but only for a short time. Remember to link the game to your Nintendo Account before doing this, otherwise you will lose all progress in the game. User /u/NeffeZz has also created a helper app for rooted devices, which automatically removes the .xml file and restarts the game, you can check it out in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/5t6hw6/app_for_resettingrerolling_the_game/). Unfortunately, there are some devices (again, usually from Chinese brands) which won't pass SafetyNet with any of these methods. For example, devices with built-in root which cannot be removed. Magisk Manager has a built-in SafetyNet checker, but if you don't use Magisk, you can install a separate app, e.g. [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottyab.safetynet.sample) one. Results may not be 100 % correct. Also, keep in mind that the game might store the info that your device was not allowed *once*. Even if your device now passes SafetyNet, you may need to reinstall the game. If you know of any other methods or maybe find a mistake, please tell me on the comments and I will edit this post. I'll try to answer any questions about this, but I do have to work and sleep too! **Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any data loss or damage on your device and I can't guarantee these methods will work for you.** ***Always make sure to have a backup.***</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Update**: Solved by flashing the latest CarbonROM. The problem was on LineageOS, though the app had worked for me before on it. _________ I'm having a problem logging into my account on the Android app, using the latest version available on Google Play. I'm getting the error: "**We had some trouble signing in to your account, please try again**", which really doesn't tell much. Things I have tried: * ensuring PushBullet has all of the permissions granted before trying to log in * clearing the cache and data * reinstalling the app * removing the Google account from my phone and adding it back * removing all mobile devices from the devices list while signed in on a desktop browser All other apps with Google sign-in are working correctly. I don't use any kind of adblock on my phone, if that matters. My phone is a OnePlus 2 running a fresh install of Android 7.1.2. [Here are relevant logs from the moment I try to log in](https://i.imgur.com/DSWGBJo.jpg). I love your app, and I've been a happy user of PushBullet for a few years now. It's not something I'm willing to lose access to, so I'd be really grateful for any advice. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TOMT] [ANIMATION SHORT] A robot following different arrows (early 2000s)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-17 22:52:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Trying my luck here as I've found absolutely nothing about this on Google. In the early 2000s, every now and then I would watch a short animated film with my father and brother. By "short" I mean max 10 minutes, most probably about 5 minutes or less. The film was about a robot who encountered an arrow. He followed the arrow's direction until he found another arrow, maybe on a different surface now. He continued his little journey, arrow after arrow. Eventually he was climbing on some sort of building but it seemed like the arrows would never stop... Unfortunately I don't remember the conclusion. The film had a pretty gloomy atmosphere because of the dark color scheme it used, maybe it happened at night-time. But the arrows always clearly stood out from everything else. It was a 2D animation, and it seemed like it was traditionally hand-drawn. The clip had very little music in it (if at all) and it had no voice acting, but there were probably a few sound effects here and there. It was on a VHS cassette, but I think we originally saw it on television and then just recorded it so we could watch it any time later. It was on Finnish television, which makes me think that it might have actually been a Finnish animation too, which would kinda explain why I didn't find any info on Google in English (though I didn't find anything in Finnish either). Finland has a very non-existent animation business, so it might have been an animation from an art school student or something. Just trying to make an educated guess here. I was about 4 or 5 years old back then, so everything here might not be 100 % accurate information, but I tried my best to remember the details.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I use the Ethereum logo on my website? The logo assets don't seem to be licensed under Creative Commons anymore.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-11 18:47:08</DATE>
    <TEXT># UPDATE 14/11/2018 I finally got an answer from the Foundation:  gt; Please feel free to use our logo for your website, so long as it's not altered considerably or used in any misleading ways. [...] Feel free to use it without attribution for the moment. Our terms may change in the future, but this should be fine for now. #160; They didn't say anything about a particular license, but it's safe to assume that the logo assets certainly aren't under CC Attribution 3.0 anymore, as the change on the website implied. ***  #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; What's the situation with the Ethereum logo assets? Up until January 2018, the official website had this text on the [assets page](https://web.archive.org/web/20180129172257/https://www.ethereum.org/assets):  gt;We have a more open approach towards the use of the Ethereum logo that is more community-friendly and supports the greater Ethereum and crypto innovation ecosystem. All current Ethereum logos are under Creative Commons attribution 3.0. The last sentence that states the license is **not** on the [current version](https://www.ethereum.org/assets) of the page. Anyway, the page instructs to read the [branding page](https://www.ethereum.org/brand) instead if the use is not for an article. That page states:  gt;We are revising those guidelines in order to have a more open approach towards the use of the Ethereum logo that is more community-friendly and supports the greater Ethereum and crypto innovation ecosystem.  gt;The Ethereum Foundation may be releasing a special seal for use by approved people or entities for foundation specific advocacy, fundraising, and mission-related efforts; more details will be announced. This makes it seem like *nobody* is currently allowed to use the logos outside of news articles, before they have revised their guidelines. The PDF on the page doesn't say anything useful on the matter. I did send a message to the brand email address, but haven't received a response yet. I also found out that the logo (without text) has been redistributed on [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ethereum_logo_2014.svg) a couple of years ago, under the CC Attribution 3.0 Unported license. The [Creative Commons FAQ](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-if-i-change-my-mind-about-using-a-cc-license) states:  gt;CC licenses are not revocable. Once something has been published under a CC license, licensees may continue using it according to the license terms for the duration of applicable copyright and similar rights. As a licensor, you may stop distributing under the CC license at any time, but anyone who has access to a copy of the material may continue to redistribute it under the CC license terms. If I'm interpreting this right, it means I can use the logo on my commercial website because it was once distributed with the aforementioned license. Although, the logo on Wikimedia doesn't actually match exactly with the current logo on the assets page, since the colors are a bit different (I checked this via GIMP). Any thoughts or (official) information on this?</TEXT>

There #8217;s no such thing as  #8220;encrypt and decrypt 100 times #8221; in the games, and calling the cryptographic functions won #8217;t add much overhead. A well-known Pok #233;mon hacker and the main developer of PKHeX, Kaphotics, posted [this](https://twitter.com/Kaphotics/status/1139581454621523969) on Twitter:  gt;To clear up some misinformation: no, the game does not decrypt  amp; encrypt 100x when generating a Pok #233;mon.

    <TEXT> gt;Are they burned out as a studio? Yes, very much. It might be hard to believe this, but the team #8217;s schedule and working conditions have been quite horrible from the beginning of the anime. They just physically can #8217;t do this anymore. In case you don #8217;t know, the studio doesn #8217;t get to decide the schedule, the production committee does. The committee has invested large amounts of money to the project; they want their profit and they want it *fast*. To give you an idea about their production conditions, here #8217;s an excerpt from [an article by ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2017/anime-expo/world-premiere-of-ancient-magus-bride-tv/.118040):  gt;Producer #160;George Wada #160;and director #160;Norihiro Naganuma #160;emphasized the extremes the animation staff went to pull off in the earlier panel, detailing how they worked day and night, surviving only energy bars and fans' smiles.  gt;  gt;**George Wada:** #160;Most of the members of #160;Wit Studio just finished #160;Attack on Titan #160;and they're passed out right now. Now that it's over, they are going to be working very hard on the next title, Ancient Magus Bride so you all can enjoy it. We're going to relay your passion to #160;Wit Studio, so all the employees remember all of you.  gt;  gt;**Norihiro Naganuma:** #160;Thank you for coming. I thank you all for the invitation and I'm very excited to tag along with Wada to see everyone enjoy the series' footage for the first time. I hope you all enjoy it. I'm going to whip all the staff that worked on #160;Attack on Titan #160;back to work!  gt;  gt;**What's been your experience at Studio Wit so far, Naganuma?**  gt;  gt;**Naganuma:** #160;It's a battlefield. Basically what you see on screen in #160;Attack on Titan #160;is what I see at Studio Wit. One comrade falls after another.  gt;  gt;**Wada:** #160;The default lunch of Studio Wit members is energy bars.  gt;  gt;**Naganuma:** #160;And they all magically revive after eating one and then go back to work. That's kinda the work environment so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was animated by a single guy, Masaaki Iwane. He #8217;s actually a super experienced animator and has been animating in the Pok #233;mon anime since the very first episode. He is a notably fast animator and has been solo key animating every 7th-or-so episode of Sun  amp; Moon. This clip was a bit of an experiment. Iwane draws usually on paper, but this time he animated [digitally](https://twitter.com/kato_olm/status/1144264840468414464). The thing that stands out most in the animated sequence is the fact that the faces of the characters are very much Iwane #8217;s own style. I #8217;m guessing there was no animation direction for the clip, or that Iwane himself was also the animation director. It #8217;s most apparent in the Sun  amp; Moon characters who don #8217;t look like how they do in the anime.</TEXT>

In general, schedules are bad, which leads to unfortunate shortcomings in productions. Animation studios themselves have hardly anything to say to the schedules: those are decided by production committees who actually fund the whole productions. The committee usually consists of multiple parties that have made an investment in the anime project: they want their profit and they want it *fast*.</TEXT>

Animators like Ikarashi and Hiroyuki Imaishi take Kanada #8217;s limited animation to the extreme, and it #8217;s certainly not everyone #8217;s cup of tea! Edit: You can check out more of Ikarashi #8217;s animation [here](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=kai_ikarashi+)!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;in terms of the animation it felt choppy. The intro #8217;s character designer and animation director was Kai Ikarashi, who also co-animated the clip with Ichigo Kanno. Ikarashi #8217;s animation style is strongly influenced by the late Yoshinori Kanada, who is known for his limited kind of motion in his animations. Ikarashi takes this style of animation to the extreme and uses a very snappy timing  #8211; it #8217;s certainly not everyone #8217;s cup of tea!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Wouldn't they ask for more money if it takes a ridiculous amount of time? I find it hard to believe they are paid the same for more work. I #8217;ve gotten the impression that animators aren #8217;t really in a position to ask for more money. If you want to make an extra cool cut and the schedule allows it, then by all means do your best  #8211; but you won #8217;t get paid any extra. I #8217;ve heard this sad truth from multiple industry people, [here #8217;s](https://medium.com/@manu/bahi-jd-europe-meets-japanese-animation-6e32b9547507) an interview with Bahi JD, for example. However, as I said, there are very few examples of animators asking for more, like Nakaya Onsen. He #8217;s a freelancer and asks for a higher payrate than the average animator gets. He #8217;s quite new but a very skilled animator, and is sought for some specific kind of episodes or scenes. This might be a bit more risky approach to freelancing, since he probably won #8217;t get nearly as many job offers as the regular freelance animator. He only works in a couple of productions in a year, I think.  gt;Anyhow time can be a major factor, they probably don't have time to make every scene high quality. Schedules are messy more often than not, and even a great animator might not be able to meet quality standards if time runs out. So yeah, time is a big  #8211; or maybe the biggest  #8211; factor in the quality of the final product.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve noticed that more and more artists have been starting to use Pixiv just as an archive: they post new art to Twitter, and then after a few weeks they post a collection of their recent artworks to Pixiv. I think on Twitter it #8217;s easier for artists to get a bigger audience, so it #8217;s understandable why some prefer it to Pixiv. I #8217;m a big fan of the Aikatsu franchise, and there #8217;s a HUGE amount of art that #8217;s only posted to Twitter. It #8217;s frustrating because it #8217;s so easy to miss stuff there as many artists also post a lot of other content on their account while I #8217;m only really interested in the art. It #8217;s also impossible to find some stuff by searching and reverse image searching from Twitter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Polygon Pictures #8217; works, the characters or objects mainly move every other frame of the video, which itself is encoded in the standard framerate of 24 fps. You can check this by framestepping in a video player. However, I recall that in Blame! the framerate of the objects is sometimes raised for cuts with fast movement. Rendering objects in a low framerate is most probably a stylistic choice to make the end result resemble hand-drawn anime. I don #8217;t think it works well, since in 3D there is an additional dimension for our brains to process, and the motion loses so much information that it might be hard to interpret what #8217;s actually going on. For some people it even causes headaches. Edit: a typo.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-29 16:42:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>There #8217;s this somewhat common thing in the Japanese-speaking internet, where the poster ends their message with a statement separated from the rest of the message with a **single** parenthesis. An example:  gt; #24515; #12394; #12375; #12363; #38553; #38291; #12364; #24195; #12364; #12387;...( #20309; #12390; #12467; #12488; #35328; #12358; #12435; #12384; #12387;!! I see it every day on Twitter. I *think* it #8217;s usually used to make a joke or an ironic statement or something along those lines #8230; But where did this start? Why is only one parenthesis used? Is there some place where I can read more about it? I tried googling around, but it #8217;s pretty hard to find anything about this! I #8217;m still a beginner in Japanese.</TEXT>

And you #8217;re not actually far off for mentioning  #8220;shounen #8221;, since Satou does key animation for shows like [Hero Academia](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=yuki_sato+my_hero_academia+) and [Fire Force](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=yuki_sato+fire_force)!

    <TEXT>I assume the artwork hasn #8217;t been posted here, since I didn #8217;t find it by searching. I #8217;ll also share some additional details of the OP  amp; ED below. The cutscenes were directed and storyboarded by [Junichi Yamamoto](https://twitter.com/yamamotojunichi/status/1175004451385430017). He played the game as a kid but never finished it, so this time he wants to clear it! Since the [game #8217;s credits](https://i.imgur.com/QWYr1S1.png) don #8217;t list the roles for the cutscene staff, it #8217;s uncertain what the other credited people did. However, if you look up Iwasawa and Kanou, you can find out them being listed as producers in several anime projects, so that #8217;s supposedly what they did here too. The rest of the staff (Sasaki, Okada and Hikosaka) are probably in charge of animation and compositing/post-processing. Yamamoto has worked before with Iwasawa and Kanou in Time Driver, a short movie made for the Young Animator Training Project. It #8217;s likely that the animators who worked in the LAHD cutscenes are very new to the industry!</TEXT>

From a legal perspective, this animation *could be considered* a derivative work, i.e. a work created by adapting a pre-existing work.

As for a derivative work such as those translated, dramatized, cinematized, etc. the author of the original work, in principle, has the same set of rights as the author of the derivative work. Therefore, it is necessary to have the authorization of the author of both the original and the translation to publish a translated work Note: I #8217;m not a lawyer nor an expert in interpreting law, just sharing some general related copyright info on the subject.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;key frames design, storyboarding Hmm? That #8217;s not what a *satsuei* ( #25774; #24433;) is responsible for in anime. It #8217;s about combining all the different visual elements together  #8211; that is, key animation, digital effects/CGI and backgrounds. Personally I #8217;m not really fond of using the word  #8220;photography #8221; for anime *satsuei*, because it #8217;s a vastly different kind of job compared to traditional live action film photography, and it gives the wrong idea to people who are more familiar with traditional film terminology. I think  #8220;compositing #8221; or  #8220;the director of compositing #8221; are usually better terms to use for anime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m starting to think that Masahiro Mukai was not a very good choice for directing HeroAca. They #8217;ve had plenty of time and resources, but animation just isn #8217;t utilized much, which is a big shame especially for a series like this. Even this episode had multiple talented animators like [Ozora Kondo](https://twitter.com/hujisora), [Gem](https://twitter.com/gem_ch18) and [Till](https://twitter.com/tilfinning), but when the direction and especially the storyboards don #8217;t give opportunities for animation, you get cool stills at best. I have to say that Mukai clearly has an eye for shot composition though, I personally loved the [stuff](https://imgur.com/a/vOZeAU6) in the first two episodes which were directed and storyboarded by himself. Conveying action via animation just probably isn #8217;t his thing, as dumb as it sounds. He also storyboarded the opening, and while it has nice shots and it flows well with the song, the main action part with the song #8217;s chorus and the character carousel is just very uninspired storyboard-wise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Masahiro Mukai's direction is as boring as boring gets I slightly disagree here. I think he definitely has potential as a director and a storyboarder, **but** conveying action in an engaging way might just not be his thing, which is obviously a bad thing in an action series. He has a good eye for shot composition though, I personally enjoyed his [stuff](https://imgur.com/a/vOZeAU6) in the two first episodes which were directed and storyboarded by himself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think even episodes which Mukai didn #8217;t personally direct/storyboard have had many good shots, though I don #8217;t have any examples at hand right now. It #8217;s kind of weird, but episode 6 stands out for me, they managed to make it really interesting despite the fact that people are literally sitting in a room for almost the whole runtime. It just felt particularly well-paced, and it utilized the soundtrack and interesting shots together well.  gt;Maybe Mukai just could not keep up? Then again, he had extra time, it really is strange. We can #8217;t really know for sure, but my guess would be that it boils down to Mukai not being able to handle action stuff well, and the effect just escalates to episode directors and storyboarders. We #8217;ve been in the action phase of the arc for a few episodes now, but the storyboards have not been very good at showcasing that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What really brings them to life for me is how KyoAni animates their body language. Yeah, if I would pick one aspect as the forte of KyoAni, it would be the character animation. They have a really good attention to detail when it comes to gesticulation and motion of seemingly mundane actions. I mean just look at [this](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/84392) or [this](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/83745) clip from Euphonium.

There seems to be conflicting information about this. AniDB and [seesaawiki](https://seesaawiki.jp/w/radioi_34/d/) #8217;s anime staff database list Yamaguchi as the kantoku ( #30435; #30563;), which usually means general direction, not episode direction. Yonetani is listed on those sites as sou kantoku ( #32207; #30435; #30563;) i.e. chief director, which usually isn #8217;t as involved role as the general director #8217;s role is. Yamaguchi is also listed as the episode director ( #28436; #20986;) for the first two episodes on those sites. Edit: Found a confirmation from [the official website](http://www.gaogaigar.net/FINAL/outline/) that **Yamaguchi did indeed direct the series**. Yonetani was the chief director.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not actually interested in this series and I don #8217;t know enough specifics of this production to talk about it more. But what fans should be aware of is that when content like this ends up broadcasted, 99.9 % of time it #8217;s about scheduling problems. Not because the  #8220;staff can #8217;t draw #8221;. There #8217;s little that an animator or an animation director can do if there #8217;s simply not time and the episode needs to be released. Scheduling problems usually stem from the production committee #8217;s decisions. Usually studios aren #8217;t in the committee themselves  #8211; and even when they are, they still don #8217;t have a big say in these matters as they don #8217;t have much money to put into the project themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t help but feel sorry about Miu forcing herself to become an idol #8230; it seemed like she really *really* doesn #8217;t want to do it. I liked the layouts [here](https://i.imgur.com/zczgq0q.jpg) and especially [here](https://i.imgur.com/0tbT1Id.jpg). Otherwise it was a pretty normal  amp; unambitious starting episode storyboard-wise and direction-wise. They did a decent job in introducing Miu #8217;s personality and feelings, which I think is the most important thing as she #8217;s the main character. Something I #8217;m a bit worried about is the complexity Majiro #8217;s designs. The high line count requires time and effort to draw and animate, and I #8217;m not sure if the production is healthy enough for keeping it in shape. In fact, there were some [very off-model characters](https://i.imgur.com/6AQhgbx.jpg) even in this episode, which is not a good sign. To end in a happier note, I really liked both the opening and the ending. The OP had a nice [atmosphere](https://i.imgur.com/t3XpiSg.jpg) with a [good use](https://i.imgur.com/KJ8EEfc.jpg) of [lighting](https://i.imgur.com/suw7tpU.jpg). I haven #8217;t heard any of the group #8217;s songs before, but the OP #8217;s was really good, I think what makes it particularly interesting is how Mai is quite literally just speaking in her normal, calm voice in between the singing parts. The [ending drawings](https://imgur.com/a/1KUgoSf) by Mamoru Sasaki were also a blessing, such a cute selection of colors too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not strange, you just need to understand that the main Pok #233;mon anime franchise has a long-running production model  #8211; there are practically no breaks in its production. It #8217;s not fair to compare it to one-off projects that consist of years of pre-production and planning and have a more dedicated timeframe for release. Sun  amp; Moon was already one of the most consistent long-running anime series production-wise, it #8217;s unlikely we #8217;ll get anything better than that from the franchise without them changing the release model.</TEXT>

Just throwing a guess, but maybe they just don #8217;t want to allocate too much money and resources to additional projects?

    <TEXT>The episode had many animation directors and 2nd key animators, which usually suggests that production might not be going as well as intended. The monthly release is probably a good thing, assuming that the series is still in production. I think it #8217;s also smart to release monthly for marketing reasons: The final episode will release in summer, so the series will keep up the hype until the first DLC for Sword and Shield drops.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. The problem really is that the storyboards don #8217;t utilize a lot of (action) animation. There have been a lot of scenes that could have been more dynamic, and they #8217;ve had plenty of time and skilled animators in use, but it just goes to waste when all they get to draw are stills.

In fact, they #8217;ve had **plenty** of time and skilled animators available; the problem with this season is the bland direction and especially storyboarding, which leaves little opportunities for skilled animators to make engaging action cuts. I #8217;ve come to the conclusion that the strict and non-dynamic storyboards are a directorial quirk of Mukai, and the effect kind of escalates to the episode directors and storyboarders.</TEXT>

After creating the storyboard for the scene, he drew a very rough animation that depicts the movements of the characters and backgrounds. Then the director checks it, and after that it goes to the 3D team who will use it as a reference to create the actual camera motion in a 3D environment. Imai then did the layouts and actual key animation using Clip Studio, which is a tool that he started to use in season 3. Previously he drew the layouts in Flash, and key animation on paper. He also [says](https://i.imgur.com/8s7GBvq.jpg) that he was working on the scene for about 4 months, but I assume this means that he also worked on other stuff during that time period.

    <TEXT>Doesn #8217;t seem like there are many people knowledgeable about anime or animation here, so I #8217;ll share some details that I think are important to note. Drawing is only half of the job of an animator. The other half is the **timing**. Because the drawings are usually supervised by animation directors to ensure the characters match their designs, this usually leaves timing as the ***only*** *major aspect that an animator can use to express themselves and their uniqueness*. How many inbetween frames should there be between a character preparing a punch and the moment it hits? How fast should a transition be for normal character acting changing to a surprised reaction? Should there be a stable or a varying frame rate* when a character falls over? These are the questions a key animator has to consider when animating a scene and filling in a [time sheet](https://rubberslug.s3.amazonaws.com/user/e/956e0ca3a4e4a8eb88b9d98037d984b/ypc9ko1wem_o.jpg), which is essentially the blueprint of the motion of different objects in a scene. [Careful and delicate movement](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/81425) usually requires a steadier approach to timing, while action can benefit from [crazier perspectives and key poses](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/36920). Some animators prefer [a snappy timing with few frames](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/18950) no matter what they #8217;re animating. When you consider all this, it should be clear that the timing and key poses alone should qualify as a creative effort that automatically obtains copyright protection. The animators of the Cosmic MV have copied other animators #8217; unique approaches to motion, (allegedly) without permission. It #8217;s disrespectful to the artists and might infringe copyright**. Of course the music video still has a lot of original content, the song itself being the most obvious thing. In a legal sense, though, this music video might classify as a derivative work as it modifies some existing, original work. A permission or license from the copyright holder of the original work is required to legally create a derivative work. **Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.** I do not have any legal education. It is impossible to say for sure if this particular case is a copyright infringement, as the legality of using only parts of a work is complicated (especially if fair use is considered; though this also depends on which country #8217;s legislation is being interpreted). I #8217;m merely stating that existing work *was* used in the music video, and knowing the creative process behind animation, I see no reason why the motion (the timing and poses) of that existing work *wouldn #8217;t* receive copyright protection. --- #### Resources For a brief explanation of the timesheet, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7LSqr_f4dE). For a more comprehensive overview about the process of key animation, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk6CrK7EVzY?t=311) from Striving for Animation, a channel by two animators of which one is currently working in Japan as an animator. Or alternatively, check out this video series by Dong Chang, a Canadian animator who is also working on anime in Japan: * [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cob2P5UJ5B4) * [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6zFMZL2y3M) * [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH76p-5aXg) --- \* Not the framerate of the video, but the rate of unique drawings. The video framerate of the final release is always 24 fps for a traditionally animated production, and the whole timing process of animators relies on this fact. Even the time sheets are designed for this framerate. ** Which, at least in the case of anime, usually belongs either to the studio or one of the companies in the production committee.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; They copied tiny bits and pieces of choreography and framing and then stitched them together to make one greater piece, they then did the art in their style, and the entire surrounding context is that it #8217;s a big reference to anime, that #8217;s not against copyright. When thinking in a strictly legal sense, you can #8217;t go assuming that even if the intentions were good (in this case, a homage-like effort), then it must mean it #8217;s not infringing any copyrights. It #8217;s a kind of a grey area, which is apparent if you search about similar court cases, and those are of course always judged on a case-by-case basis. The U.S. also has the fair use doctrine, which complicates things even further.  gt; I see absolutely zero legal reference or explanation as to why anyone should agree with you here that #8217;s it #8217;s considered copyright. Not every detail an artist does with a product is copyrighted. Obviously I #8217;m not a lawyer (and I don #8217;t think you are either), but I do know what a derivative work is. Parts of existing, original works were used to create a derivative work: In this case, the timing and key poses were taken from existing works of animation, which were then amended by original work (the new original drawings and of course the song itself, among a lot of things). A permission or license is needed from the copyright holder of the original work in order to legally create a derivative work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; no piece from the original work was used It was, it just isn #8217;t a simple trace. The characters in the music video *would not move in the way the do* if someone didn #8217;t first do the timing and key poses for the cuts in question. And that someone wasn #8217;t anyone in the music video #8217;s staff.  gt; the things that they used weren #8217;t, on their own, protected by copyright  gt; they didn #8217;t directly use any copyright protected aspect of the original content Do you have a proof or source for the fact that timing and poses of an animation somehow don #8217;t obtain copyright protection at all? I would find that weird, because there definitely is enough originality in those to be considered a creative work. Even if you take some really simple motion, for example a walk cycle, every animator does it differently.  gt; the portions they used are too short and too different to be considered derivative, this is why I brought up fortnite dancing on tik tok earlier. Do you have any sources for what is considered long enough in animation to receive copyright protection? I #8217;ve been under the assumption that there aren #8217;t really any numerical limits or requirements for that, only the aspect of creativity that satisfies the originality requirement. The  #8220;too different #8221; part only really makes sense if you look at the visuals without acknowledging any of the movements. Yes, the drawings and aesthetic look completely different compared to the anime clips, but again, the poses and timing are copied.  gt; I know you #8217;re not a lawyer and that #8217;s fine, but you just can #8217;t tell people that you  #8220;know what a derivative work is #8221; and you can #8217;t just say that it  #8220;should be covered by copyright #8221; without SOME kind of source because it #8217;s not the case, the definitions are very specific I don #8217;t have any specific sources, I #8217;m speaking from past studying and researching. You #8217;re right that I shouldn #8217;t be shouting these things like facts, sorry about that. Somehow I tend to end up discussing the legal aspects of things even if I don #8217;t actually have any education on the matter (apart from self-learning tidbits online).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;12 fps #8221; is kind of a weird term to use, the term you #8217;re looking for is  #8220;2s #8221; (twos)  #8211; which means that there #8217;s a unique drawing every two frames of the final video, which is practically always encoded in 24 fps. The animators #8217; timesheets are designed for this framerate, and they will have to decide the timing of their scene based on it. Anyway  #8211; 2s and 3s are the standard in anime production and has nothing to do with the quality of the animation. What matters is how you time the drawings.

    <TEXT> gt; More drawings = more money. It #8217;s not that simple in the case of anime, because generally key animators get paid per cut. In other words: make a 2-second cut with 8 keyframes or a 10-second cut with 50 keyframes  #8211; get the same pay either way. Inbetweeners generally get paid per frame, but their pay is already so abysmally low that I have a hard time believing that cutting down on the amount of inbetweens would actually benefit anyone in the production.  gt; You're right that drawing on 1s, 2s, 3s, whatever isn't immediately indicative of lower quality, and can actually be used to further the storytelling aims. Yeah, this is what I meant, thanks for writing it down (I was lazy).  gt; However, modern stock anime do not use their chosen timing as an artistic decision. Rather, it's a cost saving decision. You #8217;re confusing timing and drawing count here, only the latter has an impact (though usually negligible*) on the production cost. Timing is, well, the drawings #8217; relation to each other on the timeline the animator has created on the timesheet. Animators get to choose their timing so it #8217;s very much an artistic decision.  gt; However, modern stock anime do not use their chosen timing as an artistic decision. (Assuming we #8217;re talking about the low drawing count here.) Japanese animation has a long history of being based on mostly limited animation. Originally (many decades ago), it probably was just a time-saving method, but eventually it evolved into whole new ways of utilizing and exploiting limited animation to its maximum. Arguably one of the most influential animators, the late Yoshinori Kanada, still inspires current-day animators with his methods such as cleverly placed effect-filled impact frames and heavily exaggerated poses. The works of some particularly idiosyncratic limited-style animators like Ken Yamamoto and Kai Ikarashi are constant reminders of Kanada #8217;s legacy. \* What I mean is that a few scenes animated on a higher drawing rate is not likely to have any impact on the production costs, but if a higher-up like a director decides that most of an episode will be animated on ones, then of course there will be some impact on the budget. Though the bigger concern in the case of anime is usually the *time* it takes to animate cuts with a high drawing count.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; And in a lot of cases, the limited animation can be used to give some really cool effects -- Yutapon cubes being a great example. Nakamura #8217;s current flashy style is actually very much the opposite of Kanada-inspired stuff, as his action scenes tend to have a lot of cuts that are either entirely or mostly animated on 1s. His impact frames are also kind of on the ridiculous side, because often he uses more than five consecutive frames that consist of stylized line drawings of the character/background, whereas the Kanada-style impact frames usually consist of abstract shapes and appear only for a couple of frames. [Here #8217;s such an example](https://imgur.com/aZHPk1V) by Aito Ohashi, from [this scene](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/43918) of Pok #233;mon Sun  amp; Moon #57.  gt; That said, I always appreciate anime that push the envelope a little and make it beautiful in a more traditionally Western way. Bones' work on Eureka Seven is one of my go-to examples. The entire show is animated in such a gorgeous way (with some exceptions) and the fight scenes especially have a beautiful amount of detail. I still need to watch that series at some point! Though as a fan of Norimitsu Suzuki #8217;s work, I #8217;ve actually already seen the first ending animation of the show  #8211; which is pretty mindblowing, Suzuki has an extraordinary skill of three-dimensional thinking.  gt; In fact, ironically, guilty gear Xrds faux-anime 3D is the only good example of CG I've seen in anime styling, and its not even an actual anime. Blue protocol is pretty close, but still holds a distinct 3d flavor that probably wouldn't translate well to shooting an anime. One of my go-to examples of good 3D in anime are the newer endings of the PreCure series, where [Hiroshi Miyamoto](http://twitter.com/gatyapen) is the main CG director. [Just look at this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-uDYD9_X2k) Everything is great from the models to the colors, motion and expressions! The character designs have been adapted to 3D with great care, and they don #8217;t feel like a downgrade from the 2D counterparts. When I first saw this, I actually experienced the so-called uncanny valley effect because of the weighty, realistic dance motion being mixed with cartoony characters. Nevertheless, I think Miyamoto #8217;s works are a fine sample of how good CG in anime can look when great care is put into it. I #8217;ve heard that the Japanese video game industry pays a lot more for 3D animators and animation directors, so the most skilled people usually end up working there instead of anime productions. Kind of a shame, but understandable.  gt; I'm curious, do you work in the industry? Or just a huge fan? Just a fan interested in the production side of things! There #8217;s still a lot of aspects that I don #8217;t know much about  #8211; learning can be a pain as a huge amount of anime production information is only available in Japanese (which I only know a tiny bit). Though luckily, in the recent years, there has been a surge of English anime production-related content  #8211; mainly thanks to [Sakuga Blog](https://blog.sakugabooru.com), but also other parties and individuals who are passionate about productions and share their own translations and articles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;For anime I would increase the framerate, since often scenes reduce frames by half. Just a note: by increasing the video framerate with frame interpolation, you #8217;re basically ruining the whole creative process and effort that goes into timing by the key animators. The drawing count and the timing between the drawings are by design. Different animators use a different kind of timing for different kinds of scenes. Anime is built for 24 fps video from the ground-up, even the animators #8217; [time sheets](https://rubberslug.s3.amazonaws.com/user/e/956e0ca3a4e4a8eb88b9d98037d984b/ypc9ko1wem_o.jpg) are designed for this. Timing is the biggest aspect of anime where animators can express themselves. By changing the video framerate, you #8217;re basically saying that you know better than the animators how their own scenes should be timed. See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/f24zmj/-/fhbu8im) for some related details and resources. Of course, I have no right of telling you how you should consume your media, this is just a something you should probably be aware of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I'm not referring to frame interpolation per se but rather to motion interpolation, which with `vapoursynth` can have satisfying results. It's a specific subset. I #8217;ve never heard anyone separate those terms, they refer to the exact same thing as far as I know: you generate intermediate frames to make the motion appear smoother.  gt; No, the budget is. Seems like you misunderstood and/or I was unclear. What I meant is that for animators, timing is the the biggest creative part of their job (as opposed to drawing, spacing, etc.).  gt;Have you checked what an array of filter OP is using already? Apparently you didn't and apparently that's not at all a concern of his. I #8217;ve noticed that **many** people just simply don #8217;t *know* how traditional animation works in terms of timing, so they don #8217;t even consider the fact that something is lost in interpolation. It #8217;s usually the cause of lacking the knowledge and blindly using a filtering software without a proper understanding on what it #8217;s actually doing. I assume the gaming scene is partly to blame for this, since a higher framerate is always preferred there due to the nature of graphics rendering. The same won #8217;t apply to traditional animation media which are manually timed for a designated framerate.</TEXT>

I don #8217;t think they were comparing it to anything specifically. It #8217;s more expensive than traditional hand-drawn animation, that #8217;s for sure. The time consumption depends on what kind of scene it is, I guess.  gt;Better in terms of how much effort/time you have to put in to make it look good or are there other reasons too? For detailed moving objects, it #8217;s better in the terms that it saves a **lot** of time, which is a better option than 2D for many anime productions, as tight schedules are pretty much the industry standard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Really? That's unexpected, I would've assumed paying a bunch of animators draw a shitton of frames by hand would be a lot more expensive than paying a few designers to create 3D models and a few animators to animate them. The software would then just render out all of the frames that would otherwise need to be drawn by hand in next to no time.  gt; Is there something else I missed that makes it a lot more expensive or am I underestimating the amount of work that goes into anime 3DCG? The big factor to consider here isn #8217;t the expenses of 3D animation, but the fact that 2D animators are just that **dirt cheap**. They #8217;re one of the most inexpensive parts of anime production. *The vast majority are freelancers and don #8217;t have an hourly pay*; key animators are paid about 4000 #8211;6000 yen per cut, and inbetweeners are paid about 200 #8211;300 yen per frame. You can imagine how unfair this is especially for key animators, since you #8217;ll get the same pay regardless of what kind of cut you #8217;re working on or how experienced you are. It might be a 2-second still cut with only mouth movement, or it might be a 10-second action cut with tricky motion. A cut might take you hours, days, weeks or even a month. One might be wondering, why would anyone want to put effort into difficult cuts when you could just make many easy cuts and earn more money. The simple reason is that animation is a passion job, and if you want to make great animation, it #8217;s your own responsibility to take on those tasks while acknowledging that you won #8217;t get paid any extra for putting in a lot of effort. Needless to say, these pay rates are ridiculously low, and most animators can #8217;t live through animation alone. Some try to solve this issue by taking on a huge amount of work and literally animating all the time when they are awake. Many find part-time jobs to get by. Others have a personal Patreon or Pixiv Fanbox and sell their work online and at conventions to help with expenses. There are also some larger efforts to make life easier for animators, like the Animator Dormitory Project, which offers affordable apartments for animators. The pay rates of 2D key animators and inbetweeners can be a bit higher for some movie, advertisement and video game productions. However, there are less opportunities for animators to work on such projects, the majority of available jobs lie in TV anime productions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It's great that all these big hit animes have responsible studios which would rather stall back, than relase a suboptimal product. Studios hardly ever have a say in delays, though.

    <TEXT>https://www.removeddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/dnjg8l/intel_me_vs_amd_psp_vs_arm_trustzone/  gt;Hi. I'm very confused about the potentials of these "tools". Are they the same thing and have the same capabilities?  gt;I read Intel ME is capable od network access only if the network card is an Intel one, and that PSP is just an ARM core, kind of like a TPM, with no nerwork capabilities, but couldn't find a definitive answer. Should one of the two be more feared than the other one or is there no difference in the threat potential of both?  gt;ARM TrustZone is considered to be similar, the only thing I could understand with my limited knowledge is that it should be what PSP should be for AMD, but in ARM cpus there's no microcode, unlike on AMD x64, and this is both reassuring that it could be harder to exploit, but maybe worrisome because of no firmware updates? But firmware updates can be shipped through the OS, as Linux does.  gt;So it's a very confusing topic, which one of these should be considered the safest choice from a security and privacy standpoint and which of these represents the biggest threat?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To me it would seem like a bad decision to introduce new designs with the anime announcement, and then later switch them to something else. It #8217;s expected that the anime will be based on Takumi Yokota #8217;s designs that were shown in the first anime teaser image. He probably drew that Kasumin and also the Ayumu from the V-Storage magazine a couple of weeks ago.

    <TEXT>His line work is pretty recognizable. Though weirdly, for this particular picture, I think Murota #8217;s original designs shine through a lot, especially for the eyes (the very small black iris and its positioning is very Murota-like). If you check out the [earlier visual](https://spice.eplus.jp/images/aCX0BTVrp9DBWqmEIsVTofhaQq65M0fdUdyHrp7995YST5Fc1vmsMRZO8RJih48B) however, there are no signs of the Murota dot irises there. For this new image, I think Murota drew the characters. The artworks kind of look like stock promotional material that will be used across media and commercials, so maybe they wanted to keep the Murota-isms for these specific artworks even if he isn #8217;t going to work on the anime. In the anime itself, I expect the characters to look more like in the earlier visual, especially if Saitou ends up being the chief animation director as well. Edit: according to [LoveLive!Days magazine #8217;s 7th volume](https://i.imgur.com/yBHPkhi.jpg), these character artworks were drawn by Saitou ( #20316; #30011;  #25998; #34276; #25958; #21490;).

    <TEXT>Not sure what you mean by rumour. It #8217;s confirmed that the anime designs aren #8217;t done by Yuuhei Murota, who did all the character design work for the original series and Sunshine. The characters in this specific new artwork do look like mostly drawn by Murota, but you should note that these are pretty much just general promotional artworks and not exactly reflective of the animation designs. The new animation character designer is Atsushi Saitou, and his style is all over the [previous visual](https://spice.eplus.jp/images/aCX0BTVrp9DBWqmEIsVTofhaQq65M0fdUdyHrp7995YST5Fc1vmsMRZO8RJih48B.jpeg).

This looks like it was drawn by Yuuhei Murota, who isn #8217;t working on the animation production this time. For a much more reflective view of the upcoming anime, see [this image of the girls](https://i.imgur.com/wpbXtWg.png), which is compiled from the [visual](https://spice.eplus.jp/images/aCX0BTVrp9DBWqmEIsVTofhaQq65M0fdUdyHrp7995YST5Fc1vmsMRZO8RJih48B.jpeg) that was released a couple of months ago. The characters in this earlier visual look much more like the style of Atsushi Saitou, who was announced as the animation character designer for the anime. Edit: according to [LoveLive!Days magazine #8217;s 7th volume](https://i.imgur.com/yBHPkhi.jpg), these new character artworks were drawn by Saitou ( #20316; #30011;  #25998; #34276; #25958; #21490;). It seems that they want to keep the more familiar style with the general promotional imagery even if Murota himself isn #8217;t that directly involved anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both this new project and the Nijigasaki project have different animation character designers. As with the previous installments, Yuuhei Murota did the original character designs. The illustrations in this new visual are likely drawn by him too, judging from the linework and faces. This time, however, he won #8217;t be involved with the animation production at all. [Takumi Yokota](https://twitter.com/ohkowai) is in charge of the animation character designs for the Nijigasaki anime, and [Atsushi Saitou](https://twitter.com/kamatamanankotu) handles the animation designs for the new project #8217;s anime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The visual in this post though looks more similar to the MV rather than the older LL designs, feels like Atsushi Saitou did it and not Murata. There #8217;s definitely more Murota-isms in this visual, like his signature eyes with the small black dot irises and the shading of clothes. But I guess someone else might have slightly supervised them as well, it #8217;s impossible to say for sure. The drawing quirks here are very Murota-like, though. The [girls in the earlier visual](https://i.imgur.com/wpbXtWg.png) from two months back look *much more* like Saitou #8217;s style, from the poses and linework to the mouths and shading. These should be pretty easy to recognize if you compare it to his other work or illustrations on Twitter. You should also notice that compared to Murota, his shading is much more simple. In general, Saitou #8217;s approach to character design is very animation-friendly mainly because of the simple and loose linework. But this is really not a surprise, considering that he used to work at Kyoto Animation, who are known for their very character acting-centric animation. [Here #8217;s the best version of the full earlier visual](https://spice.eplus.jp/images/aCX0BTVrp9DBWqmEIsVTofhaQq65M0fdUdyHrp7995YST5Fc1vmsMRZO8RJih48B.jpeg) I could find. Also, I #8217;m mainly interested in the actual drawings, but the color design in this new visual does seem quite a lot different from previous installments. Edit: according to [LoveLive!Days magazine #8217;s 7th volume](https://i.imgur.com/yBHPkhi.jpg), these character artworks were drawn by Saitou ( #20316; #30011;  #25998; #34276; #25958; #21490;).

    <TEXT>Yes, but Murota is credited under  #12461; #12515; #12521; #12463; #12479; #12540; #12487; #12470; #12452; #12531; #21407; #26696;, while Saitou is credited under  #12461; #12515; #12521; #12463; #12479; #12540; #12487; #12470; #12452; #12531;. In the context of anime production, this means that Murota first created the original character designs, which define the main looks of the characters, so things like hair, eyes, height, body structure etc. Saitou then adapts these designs for animation. This is usually a process of keeping as many of the original design points as possible, while tuning them to be more animation-friendly, which shows especially in the linework. He then creates the appropriate *settei* sheets; these are the final model sheets that are used as a reference when episodes are animated by key animators and supervised by animation directors.</TEXT>

It #8217;s possible that there never was any direct confirmation, maybe the fans who have been very involved with this just ruled out everything else and sort of came to the conclusion that it must be a pen name of Omata.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;How till yesterday all evidence and leakers pointed to a studio under IG Port This was a half-truth: insiders know that a new studio was created under IG Port, and that Araki (AoT #8217;s previous director) is the head of it. Then some people made educated guess that this new studio would continue the production of AoT, but a lot of people took these guesses as facts. Now that we know the old team is not working on the final season of AoT, it #8217;s very likely that the new studio will actually be in charge of Kabaneri (of which Araki is also the director).  gt;Also why did they get another composer with Sawano and how will this affect the composition of the tracks (will each do half of the number of tracks or they will simply mix their talents together) There could be many reasons for this. One that I can think of is to spread the workload and make the composition process faster. Though if you check out Yamamoto #8217;s previous works, you can see that he has worked with Sawano many times before, so Sawano might have simply just wanted to work with his friend this time. If you look up e.g. Yamamoto #8217;s discography (on [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/4d9bcf67-f7b1-40ae-b494-cdb3fd95bfa2), for example), you can see that they both compose mostly their own tracks in a soundtrack, so they don #8217;t really collaborate on individual pieces.  gt;Could we expect freelance animators from WIT like Imai to come bacK? Not all the freelance animators are as WIT-affiliated as Imai, but I have no doubts that at least some of them will appear in the final season, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most likely reason for WIT backing away is that the team was just very burnt out, so they decided not to accept any more work from the production committee. The production of the previous seasons has been one of the worst to date, due to scheduling and management issues, together with the fact that the adaptation has been very ambitious and demanding.

    <TEXT>My takes on the downsides of the trailer: * the storyboard does not flow well, it #8217;s hard to follow because there #8217;s a lot of unnatural rapid cuts (intentional or not, it #8217;s difficult to parse) * the compositing: there #8217;s this sort of blurry effect all over the trailer that I really don #8217;t like; I #8217;m also not a fan of the gradients and texture of the titans #8217; skin and the smoke effect animation being softened too much * the background are passable, but far from what Studio Bihou did in earlier seasons (though admittedly we didn #8217;t see much yet) Otherwise I think it looked fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That doesn't sound very convincing. There's no point of WIT being salty about passing SnK on if they had no way of keeping the production up, so they have no reason to not let Imai work on the final season. That #8217;s not really how it works. Freelancer animators can choose to work on any and as many productions they like, as long as they deliver their cuts on time. Studios don #8217;t have a say in that. The industry is driven by connections, friends attract friends and talent attracts more talent. It #8217;s just not very likely to see Imai being involved as much as he was with the old team.</TEXT>

Was that intentional for the trailer (maybe not to properly reveal and spoil the new designs of the characters) or do you think that it is something that would also translate to the final product? Hard to say *why* they went with that, but it does seem like a deliberate decision. Maybe people didn #8217;t bring it up that much because the video quality wasn #8217;t that great, so they might confuse it for an effect of compression?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think there #8217;s much you can do to fix the root problems, unless you happen to have substantial amounts of money  amp; time, as well as knowledge, a strategy, and connections to the industry. Currently one of the best choices for fans to at least help the artists is to buy their art and books, which many of them sell via online services such as Toranoana, Melonbooks and Pixiv Booth. Animators also attend Comiket and other events to sell their work, but these are obviously not very accessible for westerners. Many animators also have a Pixiv Fanbox, where you can become a member and support them directly via monthly payments. I #8217;ve compiled [this list](https://pastebin.com/BZGECxnD) of links to support accounts of some animators. It #8217;s not comprehensive, there are of course more of those if you just check out animators #8217; social media profiles (mostly Twitter), since they usually advertise their own support platforms there. Kevin, the author of the article, has also [considered](https://twitter.com/Yuyucow/status/1264920762382798855) making a dedicated post about animators #8217; support links. Of course, those methods mostly help with supporting *individual* animators, but not much the artists as a whole. For helping with a bigger picture in mind, you could donate to larger efforts such as the [Animator Dormitory Project](https://gogetfunding.com/2019-animator-dormitory-project/). There #8217;s also a new project in the works, called [Anime Yell](https://studio.creww.me/projects/18/), which aims to create a sort of support network specifically for newbie animators, who tend to struggle the most in the industry. Otherwise the idea is the same as in many existing funding services, i.e. fans can donate money in exchange for different rewards. Simply just spreading awareness of the industry #8217;s problems is never a bad choice either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like many people expect Trigger to be better than other studios in this aspect, just because their works tend to be big hits and universally loved. This reminds me of what happened at the Liberty City Anime Con 2018 when the Anime Dormitory Project #8217;s head, Jun Sugawara, [brought up](https://twitter.com/dannyothello/status/1030611533477421056) Trigger:  gt;Jun Sugawara says one of the animators living in the dorms works at Trigger. Gasps of admiration reverberate throughout the audience with a few whoops of acknowledgement. Then proceeds to say it #8217;s a terrible working environment.</TEXT>

For those who want a much closer experience to Photoshop, I #8217;ve heard [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is great. It also fully supports PSD files, unlike GIMP. I assume by SAP you mean SAP ERP? There are other software for that stuff, we use the browser-based [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo).

Oh, I completely believe you, I just myself don #8217;t need to do anything complex with it. It does its job for everyday basic stuff for me.  gt;Oh, you've heard have you. Glad hearsay is overwriting reality now. No need to be snarky about it! It #8217;s just that I don #8217;t have any use for it personally since I #8217;ve always used GIMP, but my friends who come from a Photoshop background have praised it.  gt;Oh sure, because big companies would trust your open-source choice of software with their data and support. Does it integrate full finance function that suites over 10000 SKUs with mixture of tax implications and mixture of local/overseas and internally manufactured products? Does it interface with WMS systems that can control advanced push dispatch as well as replenishment tasks. Does it manage things like batch control for production and distribution? You #8217;re missing the point, which is that there **are** ERP solutions that are accessible on Linux. Whether companies want to actually adapt to using those is a whole different story.  gt;Glad you know one platform. Not sure what you #8217;re implying with this #8230;?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On desktop, if you hover over the text that says when the post was created (right now it says  #8220;1 day ago #8221;), you get the exact time it was posted. [Here #8217;s an example screenshot.](https://i.imgur.com/DgTmfo7.png) It should work on both new and old Reddit. On mobile web, I don #8217;t think there #8217;s any easy way to get the exact post time. One way you can do it is by putting  #8220;.json #8221; in the end of the post URL. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/hvs256/pekora_greets_and_then_hits_you/fz06gtv/.json. Then find the first `created_utc` timestamp value. The bigger the number, the later the post was created. You can convert the timestamp to a date via various online converters, for example, [this one](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php). Again, this is very annoying to do on mobile and it #8217;s preferable to do it on desktop. Some 3rd party Reddit apps might have feature to show the exact post time in a more straightforward way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think it #8217;s a work-in-progress. The word  #8220;rakugaki #8221; is used by many Japanese artists usually when referring to a relatively quick drawing, it doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s necessarily an unfinished one. Some artists also use the word for any artwork they post, regardless of perceived amount of details or complexity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are technically two different words in Japanese that are both read as  #8220;rakugaki #8221;. The first one is  #33853; #26360; #12365;, which means  #8220;scribble #8221;,  #8220;doodle #8221; or  #8220;graffiti. #8221; The second one,  #27005; #25551; #12365;, has a more nuanced meaning, which is more along the lines of  #8220;drawing for fun #8221; or  #8220;drawing free of worry #8221;. This is why you can see  #8220;rakugaki #8221; used for pretty much any kind of artwork. However, I think both of those words are used kind of interchangably nowadays, possibly because of the fact that many people don #8217;t write it in kanji, but use hiragana or just write it in Latin alphabet instead, so the line between them has sort of vanished.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had been familiar of the group #8217;s existence since about the beginning of 2019, mainly through memes and other posts on Twitter. It wasn #8217;t until June this year that I started to follow them. The video that initially got me in was Korone #8217;s playthrough of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile. I was really intrigued to watch it since it #8217;s my all-time favorite video game, and the franchise doesn #8217;t usually get much attention nowadays (there also hasn #8217;t been any new releases since 2008, and even that was just a remake of the first game). It was fun to see her enjoy the gameplay (even if it was a bit hard for her), and the story, which has some unexpected turns despite the cheerful appearance of the game. I was also surprised that the [game #8217;s director watched](https://twitter.com/yoshi_clonoa/status/1265884027308830721) the whole stream, too. After the stream I had gotten a strong impression of Korone, she #8217;s a very emotional and fun person! I went to look for more of her videos and eventually got into some other Hololivers, too.</TEXT>

It requires some setup, including installing a separate Python script to your computer and then configuring a program in the extension #8217;s settings.

    <TEXT>(First: I #8217;ll be honest and admit that I posted my comment up there just to spark some discussion.)  gt; Really? So you'd prefer a world in which people can put years of hard work and skill into making something, and then others can come along, take that thing, and steal all the profits off of it? I don #8217;t, and no one should. The problem is that we already live in that world. This kind of thing happens **all the time**. Even if we disregard the countries who don #8217;t have copyright laws and/or haven #8217;t signed the Berne convention, the situation is that copyright, as it is now, mostly helps companies who have the money to fight for their rights. Smaller creators often can #8217;t afford to do this efficiently, or at all. Copyright is good concept, but in practice it leaves much to be desired. Having the right to your content is one thing, but being able to enforce it shouldn #8217;t be a matter of money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That's still better than nothing. Companies still deserve rights, they are an essential part of our economy. Large corporations may do shitty things sometimes, but that doesn't mean we should just completely sabotage the concept of a corporation. I didn #8217;t mean to imply that companies shouldn #8217;t deserve to have the rights at all. Just that the current system favors companies, and it should be exactly as feasible for individuals to enforce their copyright.  gt; Also, you may think "oh there's no protection right now for small creators" but you're just completely wrong. Are creators still being taken advantage of sometimes? yes, for sure. But if a company outright steals from a small creator in an obvious way, they can most definitely sue and win with the lawyer being paid by the defendant because it's an easy case. Easy cases are easy cases. But for the not-so-easy cases, it #8217;s just not worth it for small creators to actually go and sue someone, because there #8217;s a chance they #8217;ll lose and end up being the payer. Companies can afford to lose cases more often than individuals. Even if the chance to lose a case is a very small one, it #8217;s still a chance.  gt; There are protections, protections that are important. The fact that current protections are not good enough is not reason to remove them entirely, that's the opposite of the solution to this problem. I agree.  gt; This is the kind of attitude I really dislike about modern political discourse. "Hey, this system isn't exactly working how we want it, therefore just get rid of it, trash it, throw it away, who needs it anyway" You #8217;re very much right. I was (intentionally) being provocative in my original comment, I apologize for that. I don #8217;t actually think we should throw the system away. By saying  #8220;fuck copyright #8221;, I meant  #8220;fuck copyright as it is now, it should be better #8221;, **not**  #8220;fuck copyright, throw it straight to the bin, we don #8217;t need anything like that ever again #8221;.</TEXT>

[Previously](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/paper-mario-origami-king/) he #8217;s mentioned that the restrictions apply to Mario characters in general. In [this interview](https://www.lavanguardia.com/videojuegos/20200717/482336286429/paper-mario-the-origami-king-creadores-tanabe-tabata-nagaya-nintendo-switch.htmlhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/videojuegos/20200717/482336286429/paper-mario-the-origami-king-creadores-tanabe-tabata-nagaya-nintendo-switch.html) he says they can #8217;t create  #8220;original characters such as the modified Goombas and Toads seen in previous games #8221;, so I #8217;m inclined to believe Koopas are included to that rule as well, especially when considering the fact that they #8217;re also a classic well-recognized species in the franchise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that  #8220;Okayu #8230; #8221; bubble is something that I wasn #8217;t hugely confident in. I know it #8217;s usually not a good practice to have vertical text in an English comic, but I thought the content was short enough to not make it that annoying. The horizontal ellipsis does look a bit weird, I did try a vertical ellipsis but for some reason didn #8217;t really like it. I also didn #8217;t want to make the text small enough to fit that narrow space, it would have looked look off since that bubble and panel is supposed to have a sort of impact in the comic. I also didn #8217;t want to to break/hyphenate the word. Everything I tried looked worse to me, so I decided to just roll with what you see in the final result. I #8217;m curious how you would #8217;ve handled it. Maybe by making the text horizontal and letting it go through the boundaries of the bubble, and then applying an outline to the text to make it neater? That didn #8217;t cross my mind while making it.  gt;If you plan to do more in the future and want some advice, feel free to ask. Thank you, I #8217;ll be sure to hit you up if I do any more in the future! Edit: [I tried the vertical ellipsis again, and now I kinda like it more, lol.](https://imgur.com/9n9GGym) Oh, well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, the way copyright works is you automatically gain the copyright to a work when you make it. There #8217;s no  #8220;copyrighting #8221; process. The *Da Coconut Nut* song was composed and lyricised by Ryan Cayabyab, and the song does not happen to have any kind of permissive license for its use. This means that from a legal perspective, a permission from the author is required in order to use it for any kind of purpose, unless fair use or a similar doctrine is applicable. The same applies to the specific recording itself, which in this case is by [Jeff Lau](https://www.youtube.com/user/J3FFL4U).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;you did good for your first try, OP. honestly I just started my typesetting career without much thought, I didn't even mention on my very first typeset post that that was my first time. i forgot even how exactly i started but im so glad i did. Thanks for the encouraging words. I #8217;m not sure this is actually something I continue to do in the future, since I usually don #8217;t have much time to spend on things like this. I like the translating part more than typesetting, that #8217;s for sure.  gt;When posting TL's/TS's to one subreddit for the most part, try keep track on who are other typesetters in the sub (**especially those who typeset from various artists**) in order for you to remember that there are others who do the same, and most importantly **To not repost already translated and typesetted comics** that would be a waste of time for you after all that TS time you did but turns out it's already been worked on (your post right now, i assume is not a repost because it's still up and alive) Yes, I tried to make sure that no one had translated or typeset this comic yet on Twitter or Reddit. Though I don #8217;t think all the work is for naught even if someone happened to share a typeset version of the same comic before me. It #8217;s still fun to do. In fact, I saw another TL #8217;d/TS #8217;d comic on this subreddit like yesterday, and then decided to make my own version just for fun (didn #8217;t share it anywhere).  gt;Prepare for comics/artworks that are hard to cleanup, etc. trust me i've had some projects that nearly took like 30mins-1hr to cleanup + choosing font + adding the text. This one actually took me many hours, haha. But that #8217;s probably because I started literally from zero, I didn #8217;t have any good comic/manga fonts on my system so I had to research those first, and my workflow wasn #8217;t very ideal either, though I eventually settled with doing the cleaning in GIMP and the typesetting in Inkscape. There #8217;s also the fact that I have zero drawing skills. Cleaning up the Japanese text from areas with mainly background or other simple areas is not a problem, but if it #8217;s like completely on top of artwork, then I have to pretty much give up with the cleaning. For example, in this comic, I didn #8217;t clean up the #12489; #12461; #12489; #12461; part at all, I just had to place the English  #8220;badump badump #8221; text cleverly on top of the original.  gt;Keep in mind that what you TS/TL and thus post on a sub, viewers would most likely judge the contents of the post, rather than the tiny-obvious-not-really-well-cleaned-up parts of the cleanups. believe me, i've had a few posts in where my cleanup looks so obvious to me, but the viewers don't really care about that part tbh. though, **that doesn't mean reduce your effort put into a TS project.** Yeah, I guess if it #8217;s readable and the text makes sense, that #8217;s enough for most people. I still try to make it look the best I can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Upscaling resolution is one thing, but raising the framerate or interpolating the frames is a no-no. The way traditional animation works is that the animator manually times their drawings to a designated framerate, which is almost always 24 FPS. In other words, they speficially choose which drawings to use for which frames of the video. This creates a sense of timing that is unique to each animator. When you change the framerate and/or add more frames via interpolation, you also change the timing, and then it no more follows the artistic vision of that animator. Changing the timing can be considered disrespectful towards the animator, and also as an implication that you know better than the original artist how the motion should look like. Animation is much more than arbitrarily adding more frames or drawings to it. If you #8217;re not convinced about the nature of traditional animation, you can ask any professional 2D animator, including the author of this work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is technically fan content from the designer. At least this is how it #8217;s generally agreed upon in Japanese artist circles; they call these fan arts since it #8217;s done outside of the job. For example, it #8217;s the same with anime animators, who might post a celebratory illustration or short animation on their personal Twitter account when an episode is aired (more common for important episodes). A character concept sheet on the other hand would not be considered a fan art since they got paid for that design work. Edit: a typo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The [whole translated clip](https://youtu.be/cKeuHsjBP2k) has more than a few translation mistakes, and quite awkward English. For example, at [0:50](https://youtu.be/cKeuHsjBP2k?t=50) Marine #8217;s line is subtitled as:  gt; I feel it possible to be happened on your channel! What Marine is saying is that she feels like being late for streams due to oversleeping is something that has often happened to Shion on her own channel (which is true).  #8230;I guess I #8217;ll also add this because I found it annoying, but ~~at 2:00~~ there ~~is~~ was this subtitle:  gt; Even though I get sucked! I didn #8217;t suck! I #8217;m pretty sure what Shion is actually saying is:  #8220;I did not suck nor was I sucked. #8221; Edit: added links to timestamps. Edit 2: **Sushi has now cut out that Shion part from the video to not make any more people confused.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m still very much a beginner in Japanese, but it hurts me so much to notice the kind of mistakes that change the whole meaning of the original phrase. I mean, I had to listen to the phrases multiple times myself to be sure of what is said, and then look up some of my vocabulary  amp; grammar resources to verify the meaning. But I #8217;m confident that I got them right, since I didn #8217;t try to rush it. To me, it seems like the whole translation process by Sushi is done very hastily, because the English text doesn #8217;t even seem to go through any kind of proofreading before it ends up in the final video. It #8217;s like they just decide to go with the first thing they type with their keyboard and just slam it to the video editor, instead of first trying to figure out what might be wrong or consulting a more skilled translator about it. These things make me wish I could translate some Hololive clips myself, but unfortunately I don #8217;t have the time for it. And good translations take time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;it's the reason why I don't do translations myself: I don't want to risk misrepresenting the Vtubers even if I'm 98,72% sure about what they said This is perfectly understandable, but have you considered collaborating with other people?

    <TEXT> gt;I'm not really a good team player so to speak. Whenever I work towards something I want to do it my way and at my pace and when it comes to team projects I tend to take a backseat (still provide feedback, opinions, etc. but rarely take the lead). That #8217;s fair.  gt;I also have a full time job and other hobbies besides watching Vtubers so my time I could dedicate towards translation videos is somewhat limited and irregular schedule could prove annoying to the potential partner (no guarantee of growth, exposure, no idea when I might send them something to check out, etc.). I #8217;m the same, a full-time job and too much other stuff doesn #8217;t leave much time for things like this, especially when I #8217;m just a beginner, so good translations take even more time.  gt;Then there is also the fact that I'm neither native in English or Japanese (I'm Finnish) so I have to translate things through multiple "filters" in my head and sometimes I can't come up with a good way to say or express something in one language even if I know the meaning of it. Oh, a fellow Finn! I know the struggle. Usually I end up using many English idiom and synonym resources to find the best way to express something.  gt;And it's not like there is a huge lack of translators even now and many of them do a good job translating already. Yeah, luckily there are plenty of good translators around. And I agree with everything you said about the speedsubbers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have the choice to watch it without subtitles or to not watch it at all. I would argue that those are better options than watching with blatantly *incorrect* subtitles. If you #8217;re watching a subber whose translation quality is *known* to be wonky, it #8217;s up to you if you want to risk getting the wrong idea about vtubers and what they say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When non-Japanese speakers spread around clips with incorrect translations, that #8217;s not  #8221;very little harm #8221;. Especially when it #8217;s a sensitive or a personal subject about the vtubers. I agree that we should not be hateful but instead encourage the beginner translators to use better translation practices (like getting the translation proofread by a more experienced translator, and not trying to rush a release out). But my point in the previous comment was that if you #8217;re not a Japanese speaker, you should take the note from those who know Japanese and avoid the translators whose work is deemed as low quality, if at all possible. If you end up watching their translations anyway (possibly because it #8217;s the only translation for a specific clip), you should also be aware that it #8217;s your choice if you want to risk misunderstanding some details.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-24 20:48:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>What #8217;s the meaning of  #12418; #12429; #12390;? It seems like it #8217;s mostly added as a suffix to a  #12390;-form verb. Like  #23517; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390; or  #24453; #12387; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390;. What does it convey? I initially noticed it being used by vtubers (mostly Hololive), but after observing Twitter, it seems like many, **many** different people use it. I #8217;m sure this is one of those things that #8217;s not directly translatable to English, but I #8217;d like to get a better understanding of its nuance. So far I #8217;ve been pretty stumped, and it feels like every time I hear or read it, my brain just says:  #8220;that sentence would #8217;ve been fine without it #8221;. In other words, I #8217;m not really *feeling* the nuance, regardless of who the speaker or what the situation is. It almost feels like people use it just for fun. I #8217;d be glad if someone would at least be able to give me a nudge to the right direction of what the suffix #8217;s meaning might entail (if there even is a meaning). I #8217;m a beginner in Japanese. **Edit**: Because it apparently wasn #8217;t clear, I am not talking about the Kansai-ben version of  #12390; #12418; #12425; #12387; #12383;. I #8217;m also not talking about  #20001; #25163; or  #35576; #25163;, which are different things. I have tried googling this, but couldn #8217;t find anything helpful. **Edit 2**: I #8217;m sorry for not including examples earlier, here are some. # Examples Spoken examples (timestamped): * https://youtu.be/xpQ3ox36K_Q?t=673  #23517; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390; * https://youtu.be/NN2KQ6x2keE?t=407  #12522; #12521; #12483; #12463; #12473; #12375; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390; * https://youtu.be/DrjLU0xulqY?t=1314  #24059; #12365; #36796; #12414; #12394; #12356; #12391; #12418; #12429; #12390; Written examples: * https://twitter.com/hahahasmiling/status/1297887713119465477  #35211; #12373; #12379; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390; * https://twitter.com/tete5_rn/status/1297895530941444096  #20184; #12365; #21512; #12387; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390; * https://twitter.com/Q_rara_00/status/1298028337470640128  #25945; #12360; #12390; #12418; #12429; #12390;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did notice a similar-looking structure in Kansai-ben, but that seems to be a different thing. The link you posted talks about the Kansai-ben version of the past tense  #12390; #12418; #12425; #12387; #12383;. I #8217;m talking about a phenomenon that happens with any  #12390;-form verb and is used by people who don #8217;t even speak Kansai-ben. And most of the results I get from googling are talking about  #20001; #25163;/ #35576; #25163;, which again are different things.

    <TEXT>Crunchyroll is regularly a member of an anime production committee, which means that they #8217;ll directly help fund the production and gather the budget for the studio. Whether the studio will receive any actual profits depends on the production, but the studio will have to fund some of the production themselves to get their share of profits. Most studios can #8217;t put much money in the production, so the profits for them are also low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as I know, [JAniCA #8217;s survey from 2015](http://www.janica.jp/survey/survey2015Report.pdf) is the most recent collective report on anime industry wages. For animators, the average rates per year are: * key animator: 2.82 million JPY (~26,750 USD) * layout/rough key animator: 2.34 million JPY (~22,200 USD) * 2nd key animator: 1.12 million JPY (~8,950 USD) * inbetweener: 1.11 million JPY (~8,870 USD) Needless to say, these are unlivable rates for most animators, so they will need an additional source of income. Some are lucky enough to get support from their parents (or even still living with them) and family, some will get a part-time job, some will sell art books or have a support plan on Pixiv Fanbox. And then there are some people who will try to solve the issue by taking a **lot** of job offers and literally animating all the time they are awake. Also, a reminder that the majority of animators in anime productions don #8217;t have an actual salary but an input-based pay; key animators are paid per cut, while inbetweeners are paid per frame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being high profile has little to do with the fact whether a person has a time-based salary or an input-based one. There are a lot of veteran superstar animators doing only freelance work, and also literal newbies being under employment in a studio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trigger #8217;s Patreon should be taken with a grain of salt, since there #8217;s no evidence that the profits are actually being used in a way that would improve the artists #8217; conditions as a whole. Even by anime industry standards their working environment is horrible, and multiple individual animators have spoken about this on social media, as well as Jun Sugawara (the head of Animator Dormitory Project) talking [about it on a panel](https://twitter.com/dannyothello/status/1030611533477421056) at the Liberty City Anime Con. Many newbies still leave the studio right after their training period or even before it has ended, because they simply cannot continue working in those conditions. Trigger also has a problem of [not paying people for overtime work](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/.161244); this happens with other studios as well, but Trigger being no better than others in that regard should be enough to tell how much they care about improving as a workplace. Currently the best way to support anime animators directly is to buy their art/animation books or support them on Pixiv Fanbox. [Here are some example links.](https://pastebin.com/BZGECxnD) Most animators advertise their Fanbox and books on Twitter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For anyone stumbling upon this thread: there were no new reveals, just coverage of recently announced and upcoming titles like Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and Mario 3D All-Stars. You can check out the table of contents of the issue [here](https://viewer-trial.bookwalker.jp/03/8/viewer.html?cid=e8d45519-fb08-4db7-a3e1-262d543ae113 amp;cty=1), on page 3. I #8217;m not going to buy last month #8217;s issue to confirm the wording, but I #8217;m betting that  #8220;reveal #8221; was just a miswording in Nintendo Everything #8217;s article, which was then cited by GoNintendo, NintendoLife, and others. This would not be the first time Nintendo Everything has spread a mistranslation. The only English outlets that I can recommend for Japanese-sourced Nintendo news are [PushDustIn](https://twitter.com/PushDustIn) and [Japanese Nintendo](https://twitter.com/japaneseswitch).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reddit hosts their media a bit differently than Twitter: the video and audio streams are stored in separate files. The website (or app) just fetches both of them and plays them in sync. As there is no single direct link for the media, web services and bots such as u/vredditdownloader fetch both of the streams, combine them into a single file and then re-host that file somewhere. One way you can get the direct links is by adding `.json` to the end of the thread #8217;s URL. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/iwtby6/ketsu_drum_by_asimo953/g63tjyw/.json In the returned JSON document, there should be several `v.redd.it` URLs, in the format `https://v.redd.it/{media ID here}/DASH_{video height here}.mp4`. For example: https://v.redd.it/vde97apeffo51/DASH_360.mp4. The audio should always be directly accessible from `https://v.redd.it/{media ID here}/DASH_audio.mp4`. For example: https://v.redd.it/vde97apeffo51/DASH_audio.mp4. Tools like [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) can be quite useful to quickly see all the available streams for a post, using the command `youtube-dl --list-formats URL_HERE`. When you run just `youtube-dl URL_HERE`, it automatically downloads the best available quality, and if the video and audio are separated, it merges them into a single file (needs ffmpeg installed).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, [this was already shared here two days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/j4bmhl/nenes_official_ribbon_swimsuit_wanwangomigomi/) Reposts are against the subreddit #8217;s rules. It #8217;s good etiquette to remove the repost. Content should also always be sourced, so link the original source in the comments. For future reference, you could [search for posts with the Fan Content flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/search?q=flair%3A%22Fan+Content%22 amp;restrict_sr=on amp;include_over_18=on amp;sort=new amp;t=all) to make sure something hasn #8217;t been shared yet. Use your own judgement for when a repost is acceptable, since they don #8217;t seem to be actually moderated by the staff. If it #8217;s been a few months since the content was last shared, it #8217;s probably okay to repost it, but try not to do it for content that has been shared recently. The subreddit is quite dense with posts, so it #8217;s good to keep any additional noise out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have any specific examples to link to, but to give an idea about how tight the production has been since the beginning: the animation for almost half of the episodes of the first season had to be entirely outsourced, mostly to Daume and Wanpack (also, as an interesting side note: neither of these studios exist anymore). On top of that, on average they had about 8 animation directors *per episode*. In an ideal, healthy production, there would be just one person doing the general corrections, and then one person per each special animation supervisor role, like action animation supervision and titan animation supervision. Season 2 and 3 were better in the sense that they didn #8217;t need to fully outsource any episodes, but they still had the problem of having to resort to bruteforcing with the animation supervision  #8212; peaking at a whopping 25 animation supervisors for the final episode of S2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having more employees shouldn #8217;t be taken as a guarantee of better handling of the production, however. It #8217;s still largely dependant on the management. For example, similar to MAPPA, Toei tends to take on more projects than what might be feasible for them. They employ *even more people* than MAPPA, but a lot of their productions have still had quite noticable quality drops.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two dancers credited for the ending, so it #8217;s likely referenced at the very least. Personally I #8217;m betting on it being referenced rather than rotoscoped, based on the looseness of the motion. Though you never really know, since some people are just very good at utilizing rotoscoping in a manner that doesn #8217;t make the end result unnatural or janky. Rotoscoping is just a techique that requires its own kind of skill set, after all. **Edit:** It was referenced from the performances of [RyuICHI](https://twitter.com/ryuichi0802wood/status/1315205279118630912) and [SARA YAMANAKA](https://twitter.com/SARA_1128).

    <TEXT>Freelancers. The author of the manga wanted the opening to be made by Shingo Yamashita, so they got him to direct and storyboard it. He also did all the CGI himself and was in charge of the compositing as well. The key animators are his friends and acquaintances that he invited for the occassion. The ending was directed and storyboarded by Masatsugu Nagasoe, who works mainly in the film industry, but I guess he has some friends at MAPPA because he has worked with them a few times before as well. All the key animation for the ending was provided by [Yuuki Igarashi](https://twitter.com/y50rashi), who is a freelance animator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anime openings and endings are commonly almost separate productions from the main show when it comes to the schedule and budget. This is why they often have staff who won #8217;t work on the main production at all. OPs and EDs are especially attractive to freelance animators since the pay is usually double from the normal (and as you might know, animators #8217; income isn #8217;t usually anything to boast about). In this case, the author of the manga wanted the opening to be made by Shingo Yamashita, so they got him to direct and storyboard it. Yamashita also did all the CGI himself and was in charge of the compositing as well. The key animators are his friends and acquaintances that he invited for the occassion. The ending was directed and storyboarded by Masatsugu Nagasoe, who works mainly in the film industry, but I guess he has some friends at MAPPA because he has worked with them a few times before as well. All the key animation for the ending was provided by [Yuuki Igarashi](https://twitter.com/y50rashi), who is a freelance animator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t watch the episode so I can #8217;t comment on how it looked, but the whole episode was [directed, storyboarded and **key animated single-handedly** by Junichi Takaoka](https://i.imgur.com/ELPPvDa.png). If the animation didn #8217;t please you, you probably just don #8217;t like Takaoka #8217;s style. Edit: I checked out the episode now. Takaoka seems to be fond of character acting that has a realistic tone to it, as well as making characters appear three-dimensional with thorough volumetric drawings and shading. This is probably why some people might find it  #8220;CG-like #8221;. Though making the drawings appear three-dimensional (even in motion!) is something that requires a lot of skill and is obviously much harder to do by hand than in 3D.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Is there some kind of excellent staff? This particular episode was very special in terms of staff. It was directed and storyboarded by Junichi Takaoka  #8212; but not only that, he also did **all the key animation himself**, as well as the animation supervision. Because of such heavy involvement of taking on those main roles and animation by himself, his style is *literally* all over the episode. Takaoka is an industry veteran, and while I wasn #8217;t familiar with him personally before this episode, he seems to be fond of character acting that has a realistic tone to it, as well as making characters appear three-dimensional with thorough volumetric drawings and shading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Giving the studio (and especially animators and other low level workers) more money would actually mean that they can spend more time on stuff This precisely *doesn #8217;t* apply to animators, since input-based pay is the industry standard for them. In other words, an animator gets the same pay regardless of if they spend 1 hour or 2 days for a cut (or drawing in the case of an inbetweener). Having too little time isn #8217;t solvable by paying the animators more, that needs to be solved with better scheduling, to which the production studio themselves doesn #8217;t usually have much to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; One could increase their rate per cut or drawing (key animator or inbetweener). It would mean they'd have to draw less overall which could improve their schedule indirectly. I don #8217;t quite understand this train of thought. How does increasing the animator pay rate improve the production schedule, directly or indirectly? Unless by  #8220;schedule #8221; you actually just meant the animator #8217;s own daily schedule and not the general production schedule. In that case I do kinda agree, because as you said, then the animator doesn #8217;t have to take on so many cuts from different productions and rush as many as possible to make the money for living.  gt;There are also some animators who are employed and get a monthly wage (Kyoto Animation being the one big example). Yeah, and they are an exception. One could say KyoAni is almost their own industry because they differ from everyone else in so many aspects when it comes to production and employment/staff. Various benefits for workers, restrictions on overwork, everything done in-house for the visuals (no outsourcing), treating the inbetweener role as an actual career of choice instead of just necessary training or a stepping stone for key animation and other roles, et cetera.  gt;Yes but that's where the money would need to go to make things easier for the animators. The studio above them profiting more from a project doesn't mean they'd be able to work less. My main point there was that you need to get money to the people at the bottom to change things. A better schedule from the studio doesn't solve anything on its own. Most animators could benefit from a structural change to the industry. That I do agree on. Though just a note, I was really talking about the general production schedule that #8217;s decided by the committee, because any kind of sub-scheduling for different pieces of the production is always dependent on that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree on it being rotoscoped since the motion doesn #8217;t leak through the usual qualities that result from that technique. Though you never really know, since some people are just very good at utilizing rotoscoping in a manner that doesn #8217;t make the end result unnatural or janky. Rotoscoping is just a techique that requires its own kind of skill set, after all. But I guess you could try asking the animator [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/y50rashi) if you really want to be sure.</TEXT>
