    <TEXT>i was pretty disappointed. it was set up to be a good adaptation of the book, but after the first episode i forgot that i was watching a war of the worlds adaptation. The martians presence in the story wasn't as strong as it should've been. There's no martians leaving the cylinder or their building of the tripods. i hope that the next episode can change my opinion, but since WOTW has had such a bizarre release around the world i suspect that the BBC aren't too fond of the final product either. also the "future" segments broke the suspense and the story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i thought it was alright, felt like a lot of wasted potential. the main problem is that the future scenes break all tension. if they had just made it an epilogue rather than cut throughout the entire thing then it would work better. i do like some changes such as typhoid killing the martians, not just germs. but the design of the martians was disappointing. a generic design reminescient of the aliens from a quiet place. wish we got more tripod action in the end. 6/10</TEXT>
