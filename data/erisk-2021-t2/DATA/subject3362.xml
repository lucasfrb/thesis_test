    <TEXT>The Menaphos winter weekend is active and the chance to get a sceptre of the gods is doubled. Additionally it's supposedly possible to obtain a duplicate sceptre if one is keepsaked. Anyone tried that this weekend? Results? Update: I removed my sceptre of the gods from keepsake, depleted all of its charges, keepsaked it again, and went to Pyramid Plunder again, got the duplicate sceptre after 10 runs. Update 2: I tried removing one sceptre from keepsake and the game deleted it. Back to one sceptre.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Something to think about... What if we removed lodestones?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-22 15:45:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>The recent lodestone graphical rework brought some attention to them and really got me thinking. **Lodestones, why are they in the game?** To serve as an additional vis wax sink? To be a teleport for when we're too lazy to search the bank for the specific item to get us where we want? **What if we got rid of lodestones? Hear me out.** Lodestones are the epitome of LazyScape. They rendered many teleportation methods insignificant. Remember when a new, convenient teleport item was often a really valuable quest reward? Teleport spells and tablets, enchanted jewellery, and all the special items such as the lyre, broomstick, skull sceptre, remora's necklace, clan vexillum, book of char... They're mostly obsolete now, for no good reason. Furthermore, lodestones break the immersion by reducing the size of the game world. You can be anywhere quickly, at no cost. It really adds to how cramped the map feels, and doesn't make sense lore-wise. Something many have forgot, for years there were no lodestones and all we had was the free Lumbridge home teleport as an emergency. This worked well, skillers had specific teleportation items in their "presets", and a teleport really close to a bank was precious. Something you could unlock through a huge feat, say, maxing... This is an invitation to a discussion. I'm really curious to read your opinions on this matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate that Osborne did not feed us the same rehashed statements on the livestream. Empty promises is not what we need right now. It is now clear that Jagex know there's a problem, and they want to do something about it. With this being a fact, I wish people would stop being outraged, and waited for what Jagex have to say. The current situation is far from constructive. If you really cared for the game as players, this is not the way to "push for change". At the moment, people shitting up the subreddit are more harmful to the game than MTX. Nothing will be achieved this way. No, Jagex are not trying to sweep this under the rug. No, Jagex are not trying to distract you with a new skill. Yes, of course they care for their PR and this is a PR move ahead of Runefest. But, bottom line, they want the game to prosper as much as we do. So calm the fuck down and wait for a response. /u/jagexosborne, you did well on the stream today but time is running out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Double XP weekend cancelled?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 12:48:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the past 9 years we usually had two double XP weekends a year: one in February/March and one in September/October. There have been some extra ones usually coinciding with big releases such as Menaphos and player-owned farm, but the spring and autumn dates have been a given since 2010. Now, I understand that due to Runefest there is no BTS October newspost, but shouldn't there be an advance announcement that a double XP weekend is imminent? This lack of any news is odd. Now, with Farming and Herblore getting raised to level 120 next month... I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but I can think or at least two reasons why they would want to skip the double XP weekend which usually happens during this time of the year. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quantity-wise most of the stuff you'll need is not in the game yet. Probably also price-wise; other players need to dig up the new materials before others can make use of them, so it's bound to be expensive. Out of things you can gather yourself beforehand you'll need 4k harmonic dust to make a crystal mattock, and you'll need 2 of each metal bar from bronze to elder rune to make standard metal mattocks. My sources also say having plenty signs of porter will be beneficial (to send to bank most of what you'll dig up). With all this being said, some of already existing items will be used during restoration of artefacts but unfortunately I don't know which items those will be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be 100% prepared for Archaeology: * Obtain 2 of each metal bar if you wish to smith your own metal mattocks from iron to elder rune (you get the bronze one during tutorial). Mattocks up to rune will also be available in a shop. * Gather 4k [[Harmonic dust]] from Ithell harps in Prifddinas (harmonic dust together with a dragon mattock is required to create a crystal mattock, which will come handy at level 70). * Stock up on signs of the porter (at higher Archaeology levels you'll want to bank/store some materials you'll dig up). An easy/cheap way to do this is to gather [[Memory shards]] from Hunter, Thieving, or Farming and use them to make signs of the porter. Optionally get a [[Grace of the elves]] necklace to put the porters in. * Complete quests. For absolute full completion of Archaeology you'll need access to Morytania, as well as the following quests: The Dig Site, The Golem, Desert Treasure, What Lies Below, Rocking Out, Land of the Goblins, Bringing Home The Bacon (if you're an ironman), Fairy Tale 3, The World Wakes, Koschei's Troubles (started), Plague's End, and complete the activation ritual of any totem on Anachronia. There isn't much more you can do at the moment perhaps aside from obtaining the [[Golden mattock]] override if you wish to use it and buying a [[Luck of the dwarves]] ring because since Archaeology is a gathering skill, it will work in conjunction with the Grace of the elves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're definitely better off buying the low-level mattocks from the shop. This is more of an info for those who want (or have) to do everything self-sufficiently. We do not know what the source of the dragon mattock will be except for the fact that there will be a skilling and a combat option to get it, but I still think it's a good idea to get the harmonic dust now and not after the skill comes out, regardless of how difficult it will be to get a dragon mattock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not particularly interested in the invention aspect of Archaeology rewards for now because I believe the new components and new perks (or perk combinations) will be very expensive initially and you'll likely be making them at the expense of progressing in the skill itself (for example when disassembling artefacts instead of using them for Arch XP or chronotes), so those things will only come into play at higher levels. However, you might want to prepare some empty gizmo shells for the future, especially tool gizmo shells for your mattocks once you reach level 70ish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remember that since majority of resources required to train Archaeology will be completely new, these tips are those who wish to go above and beyond in their preparations. Having these items in advance likely won't be very significant overall in training, at least not in the early levels (the further you go into a dig site, the more remote it will be from the bank). To answer your question, in addition to gathering energy you'd also need to make/get the necklaces required to make the porters, so it's definitely less complicated to get them through memory shards. Time-wise I couldn't tell (not an ironman). Personally I turned to hunter to get my memory shards, and an hour of catching butterflies gives me shards for about 15 porters IV (300 items banked).</TEXT>

Before 2009 it was an username, afterwards it was an email. It won't even change if you change the email registered to your account. Your display name (in-game) is completely separate and it's actually advised to change it (because it makes it more difficult to hack your account if it's different from your login name).</TEXT>

The fact that many desirable names are banned/removed from the system because Jagex got tired of people trading/RWTing the names around and simply decided to wipe them. The fact that it's been years since the last display name cleanup and thousands of names are on alts/mules again, waiting to be sold. Years ago Jagex's customer support (/u/mod_kelvin himself) said they'll look into updating the name system to make it fair and remove the shady stuff that's going on, without punishing legit players, but clearly they decided it's not worth the investment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>80% to 90% of the soil you screen gives you nothing. Which means out of 100 soil you get maybe 15 materials. Is soil designed just to clutter your inventory and make you drop it?

    <TEXT>It seems to me there's something askew in the core loop of the skill. Even if you screen all your soil religiously you're still severely lacking materials to restore your artefacts, and have to resort to checking material caches or dig more (but this makes you end up with extra damaged artefacts you can't do anything with). Overall, the skill seems to be very material-deficient right now. I understand they wanted to make materials a good moneymaking method by creating demand, but then why is screening so bad?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gathered list of most wanted QOL: * On/Off toggle on auto-screener (sometimes you want soil to make the special tea without having to bank the auto-screener) * Ability to quick chat the number excavated artefacts, not only restored artefacts (you need to know both for qualifications) * Pontifex ring and Legatus pendant added to tool belt (this is happening apparently?) * Left-click "Add to journal" option on lore pages * Ability to send researchers remotely using the journal * Make Complete tomes kept on death (I lost 2 tomes, feelsbadman) * Make dig site invitations reclaimable from dig site curators Not QOL but also welcome: * Balancing on material caches to discourage people from world hopping? Caches not depleting after 1 resource? * Some kind of way to pawn off all the extra damaged artefacts</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Easter event feedback - hits and misses</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-08 12:49:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>**The good:** * It is possible to have an Easter event without MTX. This must not be understated. I believe for this fact alone the event deserves praise but let's think of this as something ordinary and move on to some of the design decisions in this event. * There's story to the Easter event and it's not a copy paste Lumbridge crater reskin part 159. The fact that it's located south of Falador (where Easter event traditionally took place) leads me to believe Jagex were trying for something more "old school". Just right amount of quirky and festive. That's good. **The bad:** * Using a currency system is too reminiscent of all those MTX events which are designed to make you buy a bond or two to skip them. I understand they needed something to measure progress but players see "bring me 10k currency" and it instantly leaves a bad taste. You can tell the event was developed by the MTX team. * Chat messages. Why on earth do we need 2 (TWO) chat messages about every egg that we pick up and 3 (THREE) messages about opening a jewelled egg? Why is none of this filtered/removed? Why are they all green? I was also going to mention that the event is here just for one week but I'm not sure if that's "the good" or "the bad" - on one hand you have less time to finish the event, on the other hand, that's just one week of this egg/chat spam. Additionally, the first impression is that it's going to take a long time to get 10k eggs, until you realise you get 100ish from a huge egg and 200ish from a jewelled egg, which adds up quick. **Overall**, although the details make this event a significant nuisance, the intent and design is good, probably as good as we can get for an Easter event in RS3 at this point, so I'm not going to be overly critical. Hopefully Jagex learn from this going forward and hopefully this is not the only non-MTX holiday event this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the way they should have gone is similar to tavia's rod: make it sometimes activate a random archaeology consumable boost to the owner and people around them. A small chance for double materials is nice too, I guess. Stats-wise though, no idea why they went above time and space which is already a level 99 mattock. And the chance to skip straight to an artefact is just insane. They went all out with this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, comp rework happened, although in a very limited form. You don't need to kill each boss once for comp now. You don't need to complete profound armour for trimmed comp now. Comp cape has now almost identical stats to max cape. If you kill each boss once, you get a passive boost to the cape slot stats for any cape you wear (the reaper achievement shows the reward). Teleports and utilities from comp cape are either passive or in spellbook. No new capes have been added. Kiln capes now have technically the best single-style cape bonuses. Additionally, a bossing guild called "pvm hub" has been added (check out the death's office entrance), so you don't need the max guild for bossing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RNG yes, however the excavations supposedly have bad luck mitigation mechanic which looks at your previously obtained item and decreases the chance of obtaining it again back to back, which means the numbers of each artefact you get should be relatively equal even with small sample sizes.

Try jumping up with 100% adrenaline and using a sunshine right away, and also apply vulnerability spell together with casting sunshine. Then it's down to proper ability usage - build up adrenaline to use wild magic and asphyxiate. You should be able to destroy one crystal per cycle. In normal mode the crystal has 100k life points, I go up and destroy it before the first wave gets to him.</TEXT>

No random crashes, no problem with loading assets, no "just sit in lobby for 12 hours so the cache downloads". NXT is unoptimised, runs on single core, the "no more loading screens" was a lie, and the new minimap is absolute garbage. But hey, we got volumetric lighting (places where it's used you can count on one hand) and tree canopy cutout. And don't get me started on the "once Java client is gone NXT will be able to do X Y Z".

Care to elaborate? As for users disrespecting site-wide rediquette and downvoting posts in /new for no reason, this is very unfortunate and it's not an issue just in /r/runescape. Reducing the size of the downvote button is one of many potential tricks but ultimately it's up to users to respect the site's voting philosophy.

    <TITLE>Hero Items - a Subjective Review (or: just how much bang for your buck you get playing with RuneScape's most exotic toys)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-25 11:48:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Warning: Long. Verdict at the bottom.* ###Introduction **Hero items** is a buzzword invented at Jagex in 2017 to describe an emergent family of items designed with one idea in mind: to create excitement in the game's community. They all have some things in common: each hero item is themed after a different "legendary" RuneScape's character, and each has a different effect previously unseen in the game. The items are exceptionally rare, and a player lucky enough to obtain one is greeted with a global broadcast. With rarity comes high price, for all hero items command prices in the billions. Additions of new hero items have been few and far between, carefully reserved for the most important updates. To date only four hero items have been released: the **Hazelmere's signet ring** (with the elaborate Luck rings rework launched in 2017), **Orlando Smith's hat** (with the very successful clue scroll rework of 2018), **Tavia's fishing rod** (with the Deep Sea Fishing hub which refreshed Fishing in 2018), and the **Guildmaster Tony's mattock** (with the 2020's gathering skill, Archaeology). Over the past three years I was fortunate to own all four hero items and I tested each of them thoroughly. I took them to places where they shine the most... and to places where they don't shine at all. Getting a hold of them was a journey in its own right, from watching and counting the global broadcasts to outbidding the merchants. After months of use I noted down my subjective list of pros and cons as well as other thoughts on each of them. Without further ado... ###Hazelmere's signet ring: the Luck of Dwarves for the rich? The OG of hero items was added to the game silently with the luck rework in March 2017 but due to extreme rarity it wasn't until May that someone actually obtained one. The **Hazelmere's signet ring** is a very rare drop from the rare drop table, and you can get one from combat drops or skilling via the seren spirit. The special effect of the HSR can double any drop that falls to the ground - this happens rarely, as the chance to double an item is said to be one in a three digit number. Additionally, HSR retains the luck-enhancing effects of the LotD while having increased stats and an additional unique teleport option to the Gnome stronghold. Getting the infamous blurberry special cocktail signifies you have narrowly missed a chance to obtain this rare ring. I bought one of the first Hazelmere's signets in the game in 2017 from a merchant for 3b gp and have been using it ever since. The ring most commonly doubles bones and charms (the effect is applied before bonecrusher and charming imp) but it has also doubled some more valuable items such as noted black dragonhide, wines of zamorak, tectonic energies, a piece of subjugation robe bottoms, and even shattered anima in Shattered Worlds and dinosaur hides in Big Game Hunter. The ring's price was stable above max cash, then fell with release of the grace of elves and briefly plummeted to nearly 1b after release of Archaeology. Currently a bargain? Pros: | Cons: :--:|:--: Very universal, works in many combat and non-combat situations, and it can double anything that drops to the ground which makes for a simple yet exciting effect | It is a ring, so you cannot see it outside of player examine feature Direct upgrade from the Luck of the Dwarves in terms of stats and teleports, and can be imbued to further increase its stats | Does not double rewards in interfaces, a feature requested by players ever since the ring came out (which, according to Jagex sources, may come eventually) It is the original hero item so it is also the best-known | Unlike other hero items it does not have a fancy mouse-over tooltip explaining its effect ___ ###Orlando Smith's hat: yo dawg, we put treasure in your treasure The reason for the lack of head slot item in the clue scroll's Globetrotter outfit wasn't apparent until the first player obtained a rather ordinary-looking hat from a master clue in February 2018. Unlike other hero items, the **Orlando Smith's hat** is not an upgrade from any other existing item, but a standalone with a completely unique function. The hat has a special effect which rarely adds a casket of a lower tier inside a clue reward, for example when wearing the hat you will occasionally find an extra elite casket inside your master clue reward. The chance for this to happen ranges from 1 in 100 to 1 in 80, depending on clue tier. The effect is very unpredictable in small samples but somewhat consistent when opening lots of caskets. I used the Orlando's hat briefly in 2018 while its price was still under max cash but only completed enough clues for a few extra caskets. The hat's price has been steadily rising and is currently in the region of 3b gp, which is surprising since the hat is said to be commonly lent from player to player. Getting an elemental battlestaff from a master clue signifies you have narrowly missed a chance to obtain this rare hat. Pros: | Cons: :--:|:--: "Completes" the globetrotter outfit | Despite "completing" the globetrotter outfit it has no synergy with the outfit's effects, it just fills a slot The effect is predictable when opening large numbers of clue caskets | Does not work on easy clues at all . | Extremely bland in appearance, one needs to know exactly how it looks to recognise it in a crowd, and it can be easily mistaken for one of many hat cosmetics . | Its use is limited to one activity only, but the same can be said about the fishing rod and the mattock ___ ###Tavia's fishing rod: look at me, I am the fisherman now Release of a new hero item less than a month after the previous one came as a surprise to many. The surprise was even greater when players found out the **Tavia's fishing rod** is obtained in an elaborate setup. The player must first be lucky enough to receive an extremely rare red uncharted isle map either from fishing in the Deep Sea hub or from trading the randomly-appearing deep sea merchant. The red map can then be used to travel to a special uncharted island which is home to the yet-unseen character Tavia. It is a hut on that island that the player may "borrow" the legendary fishing rod from. Novelty doesn't end there, for Tavia's rod is also the first hero item which can directly benefit the players around its user. The rod has a special effect which "blasts" all three fishing boosts to its owner and a random boost to players nearby. The boosts are 5% extra fishing experience, 10% increase in catch rate, and a 10% chance for a double catch. As a step up from the second-best crystal rod, the Tavia's rod can be augmented with invention too. I bought the 4th Tavia's fishing rod in the game (according to the number of broadcasts) for 2.1b gp from the person who got it. This was the first "red map" obtained from fishing rather than from the deep sea merchant's store. I used the rod mostly for sailfish and waterfall fishing but I also took it to fishing frenzy and barbarian fishing. The rod activates a lot more commonly at fishing frenzy than at sailfish, probably due to more frequent xp drops - I even managed to get a few procs before the effects of the previous one ran out. According to the number of broadcasts Tavia's rod may well be the rarest hero item, and the price has been all over the place, even dropping to as low as 600m gp at one point. Currently nearing max cash as the supply depends on players buying uncharted maps. Pros: | Cons: :--:|:--: Direct upgrade from crystal fishing rod (10% increased catch chance, versus crystal's 5%, and siphons as tier 80, versus crystal's 70) | You can only use it with fishing activities that require a fishing rod Unlike crystal rod the Tavia's has no requirements to use | Its use is limited, but the same can be said about the hat and the mattock Has an effect that benefits (and notifies) nearby players which also adds to the flaunting capabilities | The effect's activation rate depends on the fishing speed so in some situations it activates rarely, and the effect is not very significant in training Sleek and beautiful design, in a crowd of crystal rods you will definitely stand out | . When you get the "red map" you can save it for a special occasion | . ___ ###Guildmaster Tony's mattock: I'm digging it A "hero mattock" was the first hero item confirmed ahead of its release, with concept art appearing around Runefest 2019, six months before Archaeology's release. It is also the only hero item with a level requirement (99 Archaeology). Finally, it's the only hero item so far which was so powerful that it had to receive a nerf in an update. Indeed, the stats of the **Guildmaster Tony's mattock** were slightly lowered but fear not - it is still a whole tier above the second-best mattock of time  amp; space. Of course you can augment it too. The Tony's mattock commonly doubles your excavated material (usually a few times a minute). This effect also works on material caches, and provides double experience. Additionally, the mattock rarely completes the progress to your next artefact, allowing you to "discover it instantly" (this effect is significantly less common and happens once every dozen artefacts or so). The mattock is there for you to grab it from the display case in the Archaeology guild... but the only way to open it is to get a Shadowy key from a tetracompass. You can also get a distorted key which will definitely get your hopes up but will probably break in the lock too. I bought the 34th Tony's mattock in the game (according to the number of broadcasts) for 5b gp from the person who got it using a shadowy key, and I have been using it every day for training. Archaeology is still a very new skill and the mattock is in high demand, valued between 4 and 5b gp. The first one in the game was sold for a record breaking 29b gp, which is more than you would pay for a blue party hat these days. Pros: | Cons: :--:|:--: The stats are a league above the mattock of time  amp; space, and you can tell the difference - arguably the most significant upgrade among hero items (9 versus 7 focus, 85 versus 80 precision) | Rather low-key in appearance (which can be a good thing), someone might ask you just why you are using a steel mattock "Instant artefact" generation speeds up the skill considerably | When you get an "instant artefact" the message is white and it is filtered, so you will probably miss it Extra materials for days | Its use is limited to one activity only, but the same can be said about the fishing rod and the hat When you get a Shadowy key you can save it for a special occasion | Requires level 99 Archaeology to use, which makes sense since you need to be a guildmaster yourself to use a guildmaster's personal tool, but it still would be very handy for pre-99 training ___ ###Verdict Make no mistake - all four hero items are extremely expensive toys for those with more money than brains. For the most part, the upgrade you get is minor and what you buy is ultimately more of a status symbol than a gameplay aid. Are they worth the buck for a rich player, though? If you have the money laying around the hero items will certainly do more for you than partyhats and dyes, especially if you give them an opportunity to perform the tasks they were designed for. **Most useful:** Hazelmere's signet ring is the most versatile hero item - a universal top-tier luck enhancer with an exciting twist, but don't ever count on a financial return from the doubled drops. **Least useful:** Orlando Smith's hat is a niche oddity for clue-minded players, and despite its consistent effect there is no reason to invest in one unless you are in treasure trails for a seriously long haul. **Biggest show-off:** Tavia's fishing rod is an exotic tool for bragging and fishing: it serves the former perfectly, but for the latter it is just a symbolic upgrade. **Hottest right now:** Guildmaster Tony's mattock is an absolute beast and a number one for all your Archaeology needs - it trumps all other mattocks overall but lacks a single "wow" effect. Thank you for reading. Looking forward to your comments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure if Tony's mattock is the most useful but it's certainly the strongest. As for Tavia's rod at sailfish, you get at most one proc an hour there (due to slow catch rate) so yeah, you'd need like 50 players with the rods to test this out. The boosts certainly stack with each other though and when it pops it just adds to the last one so a constant boost is possible. I agree that Orlando's hat is underpowered and overall I personally consider it to be the worst of hero items. As for HSR, I still think due to its universal nature it's the most useful but yeah, the effect is just so rare, the only time you see it often is when farming low-hp slayer mobs.

    <TEXT>Thank you for your kind words. I was trying to be informative and include as many interesting tidbits as possible, as well as add a personal touch. As for the first person to obtain each hero item, the original first HSR owner (and the person who Mod Timbo messaged to tell them that they got a truly special item) is still unknown, and there's some uncertainty as to who was the first Orlando hat's owner due to the fact that the hat didn't broadcast for the first month after release. Counting broadcasts is a very approximate science and when I recently downloaded the game's global broadcasts I was only able to go back to September 2019. It seems Tavia's fishing rod is the rarest hero item when you consider the rate at which it's coming into the game, closely followed by Orlando's hat. Tony's mattock is technically still the rarest in quantity but right now it's coming into the game at a much faster rate than those two and if this continues it will eventually be more common than Tavia and Orlando's (for example, there have been 38 Tony's mattock broadcasts so far and only 1 Tavia in the past month). Hazelmere's signet ring has been in the game for longer and appears to be way more common thanks to seren spirit, so there are approximately 10x more of them in the game than Tavia's or Orlando's.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jagex mods said, and I agree with it, that they should release a new hero item only if they can think of an interesting effect to add to it, and a significant piece of content to place it in. If they pump out too many hero items the entire concept will get stale and no doubt some of them will be mediocre.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had hundreds if not over a thousand HSR procs at this point, and I doubt the total value of the doubled items exceeds 40m. Unfortunately the only thing it doubled at AoD was charms and talismans, and the only thing it doubled at regular Nex was seeds and brews. Slightly more use at Vorago with doubled tectonic energies. 95% of the time it's charms, bones, etc. Certainly a lottery but at the same time it's basically a better LotD with a great potential.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There was a lot of buzz with Tavia's fishing rod and it took over a week from release of DSF until someone actually got the red map and used it. [Mod Ryan](https://twitter.com/JagexRyan/status/974694579478978560) commented on it [a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/84xcyd/how_to_get_tavias_rod/) in the days following its release.

Orlando Smith's hat originally didn't have a broadcast and its release was much more toned down, although players [quickly found out its functions](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/80kfx8/the_new_hsr_orlandos_smiths_hat/). It also wasn't originally in the master clue collection log, and the concept of "hero items" was barely taking shape. The first one was [obtained](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/80ts2h/friend_just_got_orlandos_hat_first_in_game/) very quickly after release.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope the game won't get update starved again. PvMers are dying for a new boss. We haven't had a proper quest in months and Desperate Measures is nowhere to be found. Yet the MTX events keep coming, and they keep coming... Archaeology is fantastic but you need to put something on the horizon to make people stick around. DXPW is just a cheap trick in this situation, and running them quarterly is unacceptable and frankly unsustainable as far as playerbase goes. Don't waste the opportunity Archaeology gave you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A PvM setup contains 6 gizmos. A skilling setup contains 2. Jagex, please give skillers access to more perks.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-07 09:39:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>New reward idea: An augmentable off-hand item which can accept 1 (one) tool gizmo. You could use this while training skills, along with your augmented pickaxe, hatchet, fishing rod, and so on. This way skillers would have access to 3 gizmos instead of 2, and by extension more invention perks. Currently there are so many useful tool perks but, due to the fact that body/legs slots don't accept tool gizmos, skillers don't have much wiggle room. There are almost 30 tool perks but you can only use 2 while training. Having an extra slot would mean more niche perks would finally see more use. Thoughts?</TEXT>

According to RS wiki the maximum RuneScore is 28,430 but in-game it is 28,205. Conversely, the number of all achievements according to RS wiki is 2,529, but in-game it's actually in excess of 2600. The game counts every single achievement, even repeats. On the other hand, the RuneScore for an achievement which appears in a few places is only counted once. It's a mess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn't that strike you as odd that they have nothing prepared in advance? Back in the day, as some pieces of content were nearing release, others were already in early development. This way there was always something to look forward to every month. And right now it seems that Archaeology was the last thing they had, and release schedule just... stopped? It's only been patches since then. They say the size of the RS3 development team hasn't shrunk. What gives? Edit: I'll omit the obvious argument that a multi million dollar company which produces an online MMO should be able to switch to working from home on a moment's notice, let's assume it turned out all their tools are proprietary, they didn't have access to their company's VPN, all they have at homes is notepad and MS paint, and it took them two months to get everything set up and ready.

    <TEXT>Quick tips because I'm in a rush here. Kill all brothers including Linza. Statistically you'll probably get all items except for a couple Linza ones. At that point rush only Linza and then find the tunnel, ignoring others (Linza items are on a separate reward roll). People usually skip Akrisae with the barrows amulet if possible. Gear is obviously the best weapon you can use, three pieces of ghost hunter set, and either a body or legs with undead slayer perk on it. The rest pretty much doesn't matter. To kill Linza faster: vuln her, might also wanna adren stall (relic?), weapon poison and cinderbanes for peak efficiency.</TEXT>

Regardless, as chronotes get cheaper over time, switching relics will become cheaper.

    <TEXT>The list of items was different in RSC Classic. There were 1289 items, iron mace was id 0 and from what I remember the last two items were the Legends cape and the Scythe. When those early items were imported to RS2 beta in 2003/4, the order was completely rearranged for reasons unknown (I guess maybe Andrew would remember) and Dwarf remains ended up with id 0. Perhaps they were re-implemented in this order. Also some test items and unused items from RSC were removed. Usually items from the same update (or of similar type) are next to each other on the list. Right now RS3 is up to 50k items but you have to remember that spell icons, skillguide icons, pets, and cosmetic overrides all have entries as "items" for config purposes, and every item which can be noted is listed twice (so the true number of unique, proper items is lower). To put things in perspective, Archaeology alone added nearly a thousand items.</TEXT>

Oh yeah, because Jagex said it's coming in summer 2020 at Runefest. Jagex's problem is that when they put a date on an update, the update is not coming on that date. When they don't, people keep asking for a date. There's no winning here. Personally I'd rather they didn't say when but at least telling us what they're working on would be nice.

    <TEXT>I disagree. If you wish to see what's available to you, you don't need to leave the game, just read the in-game skill guide. If you wish to see what's the most efficient way to progress, you need to put in the effort of finding that out yourself or read an external strategy guide. Games shouldn't hold you hand and literally tell you what you should be doing all the time. The point of RuneScape is to forge your own way and have fun, not to be efficient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is interesting. Content updates have what's called a project prefix. It's a short name for an update included in the game's code so that the developers can find all config/assets related to that update. "Ra3" is the project prefix for the Forgiveness of the Chaos Dwarf quest ("red axe 3" because it was the third quest in that series) and dwarf traders were released with that update, that's why their skillguide icon is named this way in code. Project prefixes aren't meant to be player-facing and are sometimes quite cryptic. A few examples: "slug2" - Slug Menace quest, "rand" - Dungeoneering (probably stands for "random dungeons"), "natureboss" - Solak, "dungeon_ulthven" - Elite Dungeon 3.</TEXT>

It's not a case of "minority versus majority playstyles", the wilderness literally serves nobody but rulebreakers and a few disruptive players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The wilderness serves no one. I'm interested in charming moths but I will not participate so it certainly doesn't serve me. An intelligent player will not go there because it's not worth getting harassed over. It's a lean-back content put in a place where you can be abused so you have to pay attention. Literally doesn't make sense. I really hope Jagex can get the ball rolling on removal of the wilderness soon, and stop enabling this terrible game design.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've told you a hundred times. A player should not be allowed to disrupt other player's activities. This should only happen in minigames. A good example of this done right is pickpocketing other players in Flash Powder Factory where it makes sense through gameplay. Want to PvP, go to clan wars, duel arena or deathmatch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Minigames are safe. Inside minigames the entire point is to foster rivalry between players. That's why you catch someone in Heist, pickpocket someone's apparatus in FPF, and kill someone in Fist of Guthix. That's part of the objective of the minigame. There's no point in pking in the wilderness other than harassment. It's not a minigame. It's just an area of the game where being an asshole is enabled by game design, and that's a flaw. I know there are certainly people who enjoy being disruptive but that's not a reason to support this playstyle.</TEXT>

I thought you were serious until you mentioned monetary reward for pking. Yes, jumping poor people with minimal gear who don't want to be in the wilderness but have to be for some reason.

    <TEXT>Ascension c'bows do not drop whole, you need to make them. Players usually create whichever one is more expensive and this can cause large swings in price for the c'bows. To stabilise the prices Jagex added a quick and easy option of swapping them between main and off-hand for those who wish to do that. Drygores and seismics do not suffer from this because the drop tables are all 50/50 between main-hands and off-hands so the supply is naturally balanced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Is an imcando mattock worth it? versus  gt; I don't care about efficiency That's about the key to it. With a better mattock you get more materials and excavate faster. The higher level you are, the less effective your low-level mattock will be. Furnace eats a lot of materials so if you use it you'll spend more money on materials or if you're in ironman you'll have to spend extra time at material caches. Personally I used Honed and Imp Souled on my mattock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Buff is worth it" means "you can make it back in the time you save". What else is there? Better looks? That's subjective. Also I guess if you're training invention siphoning a lvl 70 tool is better than lvl 60. The benefit lies mostly in the speed of training, which is the rate at which you get artefacts and the chance to get materials. This way a better tool translates to overall faster Archaeology xp. It is an investment for training. I'd say it's worth it, but a cheapskate would just get an elder rune mattock instead, which costs 60k and can't be augmented. If you intend to excavate everything yourself including materials, you shouldn't get Furnace. The bulk of xp comes from restoration, and Furnace will make you spend more time at material caches for marginal xp just so you can restore your artefacts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think people complain so much about the rogue outfit because they don't know the correct strategy to look for it. You need to actively go after the rubble to complete the rogue outfit, which involves passing around the edges of the arena more often which is not exactly optimal as far as brianpoint farming goes. Rubble is also difficult to spot, so you need to know exactly what you're looking for. Additionally, remember that the more players are in the arena, the more often rubble appears, and wearing the factory outfit (especially the mask) helps.

    <TEXT>I doubt they want DXPW to be confusing, that's a level of 4d chess Jagex isn't known for. After all they did ask for alternative naming suggestions and I trust that it was honest. However, the fact that they couldn't decide to change the name from "DXPW Live" in the last 3 months shows the managerial paralysis that beset the company. Realistically, changing this means a single piece of new artwork, and slight alterations in the DXPW newspost (which they copy-pasted anyway). They literally function on autopilot.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Problem with header mouseover text</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-20 17:48:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>There's this subreddit setting called "header mouseover text" which is most commonly used in old reddit to put mouseover text on the snoo. However, it doesn't seem to be working in new reddit at all? The set text doesn't appear when I mouse over the header or the subreddit's icon in the redesign. Is this a bug or do I have to toggle something in new reddit for it to work? I can't find the option for that. Any help will be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I've been looking into this perk for a long time. I don't currently have Mysterious 6 but I managed to get Mysterious 5 thanks to the new ancient gizmos and I know how to get the 6 fairly easily without any negative sideperks too. In the past I said I'll begin proper testing if I manage to get the highest rank of the perk so this is now finally progressing. I've also finally found a suitable test ground. Sorry for sounding so mysterious but for now I'm keeping my ideas under wraps since I don't have anything solid. If all of this doesn't pan out, recall that at Runefest 2019 Mod Osborne /u/JagexOsborne said that at this point the mystery has been going on for way too long for such a minor detail, and that Jagex might reveal the purpose of this perk at some big occasion. So I figure if we don't manage to establish what Mysterious does by the end of the year we might just get them to reveal it at RuneScape's 20th birthday in January because hey - that's about as big of an occasion as you can get. So that's where we're at now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember this launch like it was yesterday. Everyone in the entire game got teleported onto the same game tile for the start of world event 1 and it began with a cutscene, so the lag was unbearable. There were a dozen server reboots that week, I think 3 or 4 on the first day alone, with crazy short update timers. Lots of glitches, black screens, and disconnects. Probably the most reboots in a short time ever, and there were patch notes every day for the first few days. This also ruined Lumbridge forever, I miss the forest behind Lumbridge castle and the original Lumbridge swamp. The crater activities were kinda cool though, all the fighting in the crater gave a vibe which was only repeated years later with GWD2, and the warpriest armour is a really detailed set by today's standards. The new interface was extremely clunky and difficult to adjust to. For example it didn't have the transparency setting at first, I think? I remember the blue/red quick inventory slots and talking to Mod Galcian about adding extra features to the interface. Many of my suggestions made it into the game, for example the zoom lock. That week Jagex also launched the poll for the Divination skillcape colours, that was fun too. But I ramble...</TEXT>

The main reason to add a, let's call it "Other" or "Misc" flair would be to eventually move towards making post flairs mandatory and eliminating unflaired posts altogether, which is not something we're planning to do right now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Introducing Wisdom Exchange Wednesdays and Advice post flair</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-06 07:50:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone. This is a quick announcement of two new features. ### Wisdom Exchange Wednesdays Inspired in part by recent discussions in the subreddit, we have decided to establish a new biweekly megathread: Wisdom Exchange Wednesday. This will run as a supplement to the popular ProTip Tuesday and Silly Question Sunday. As a hybrid of these existing two, Wisdom Exchange Wednesday is a place for those who seek and provide advice; both questions and protips are encouraged. We would like to stress that questions are always welcome to be submitted as standalone posts with "Discussion" or "Advice" flair. Recurring megathreads are not meant as a replacement for individual question posts. Additionally, we ask that all users respect the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) and engage positively with other users, especially new players and all those who seek advice. In related news, you can now easily access the list of past ProTip Tuesdays, Wisdom Exchange Wednesdays, and Silly Question Sundays from a "Recurring threads" drop-down menu found in the subreddit header in new Reddit. The first Wisdom Exchange Wednesday runs on the 12th of August. ### Advice flair Some of you have probably noticed the new "Advice" post flair we've been rolling out over the past couple of days. The flair is meant primarily for small individual question threads. This will help differentiate broader discussion posts from advice-seeking posts. We encourage all experienced players to browse and help out. Remember that you can click on the flair name next to a post (and in the sidebar in new Reddit) and browse all posts of the same type. Thank you. Feel free to ask any questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A daily megathread is out of the question for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the subreddit is limited to two sticky posts so between that and official Jagex communication there would be no room for anything else. Secondly, having a general purpose question megathread up at all times would suggest we want to tuck all small questions away in one post, which is not the case. Thirdly, such flavourless thread would eliminate ProTip Tuesday and Silly Question Sunday, which is not a desirable trade-off. Think of it this way, we're effectively increasing the uptime of question/protip stickies by a third. Additionally, Wisdom Exchange Wednesday runs in the weeks opposite the other two recurring threads, so there will be more regularity in the schedule now. We look at traffic stats and engagement, and this solution seems favourable. You say playtime might spike in-game over the weekends, but Saturdays are actually the days with the lowest traffic in the subreddit. The option to bump the existing megathreads to weekly was discussed but has been decided against. As for some posts in /new getting downvoted unfairly, it's not a straightforward thing to address and needs some more discussions. The "Advice" flair is just the first step. Hope this explains some of your concerns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll very briefly respond to some of your questions without quoting you quoting me, to make this shorter and clearer. ---  gt; how often do we use all these spaces and need more? It happens every month. Between official announcements, TL;DWs, and recurring threads, we often run two stickies at the same time. I'd say three would be the optimal but sadly two is a site-wide limit. From last Tuesday probably at least until next Wednesday we'll have had a week of two stickies up at all times. ---  gt;Whose opinion is this? Yours or the collective mod team? This is the conclusion we've reached in the mod team. ---  gt;Huh, interesting. I guess more people are playing and not browsing as much? I didn't know you guys had access to statistics like that. The day with the highest traffic is always Monday, followed by Tuesday, then it's roughly stable with a small drop on Friday and bigger drop on Saturday, Sunday is back to midweek levels and the cycle repeats. For example, Monday last week we had 58,020 unique visits (almost 500k pageviews), compared to 48,200 on Saturday (slightly over 300k pageviews).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...assuming pre-update prices. Both amulets degrade at the same rate: Amulet of souls - full recharge: **4.5m gp** (2x Onyx) Essence of finality - full recharge: **approx. 38m** (50% of the price of: 1x Hydrix (25m) + 2 rumbling components (6m) + 50 fortunate components (45m, let's assume 900k per fortunate), precious and refined components negligible in this scale) **However,** hydrix as of right now is valued at closer to 50m due to update hype (and fortunate components are on the rise as well) so the initial recharge cost will surpass 50m.

Two interesting potential applications would be the ex-BH Annihilation maul weapon (but I'm not sure it's worth the 60% adrenaline cost), and Decimation bow (but it's a very niche effect for slayer and shattered worlds perhaps).</TEXT>

You have to understand we cannot let the subreddit become overrun with memes. It happened 5 years ago and users complained, so the rules got tightened. Memes are an important vent though and we recognise that, so it's time again to adjust the rules. Besides that, this is also a repost - I recall seeing this same exact picture recently.

    <TEXT>There are a few valid reasons to be critical of memes. Firstly, they displace all other types of content, and they can take over an entire subreddit. That's not desirable, regardless of whether you think other types of posts (discussion, questions, achievements) are important or not. This is a game subreddit first and foremost, not a meme aggregator. Secondly, the comment section under meme posts often generates no useful discussion. It's just a haha-funny-relatable easily digestible content to scroll by. Engagement with memes, other than perhaps upvotes, is low. Thirdly, you say you'd prefer memes rather than complaints... but memes are often complaints disguised as humour. Same thing, different presentation. At least these are among the reasons I think memes get reported so much as being spam, off-topic, or unrelated to RS. Because they do, and I don't think memes are so universally enjoyed as people make them out to be right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In old reddit this is possible through the sidebar in the "Filters" section. In new reddit there's no option right now (customisation in the redesign sucks) but I'll investigate workarounds. Both in old and new reddit you can browse through all posts of the same category by clicking on the flair name next to a post (and also in the sidebar in new reddit), although I know this not an ideal solution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your opinion. It seems you are in a minority and unfortunately this minority is not speaking up right now. This is a shame, the people who downvote and report memes every day should be out making their stance known. I'd like to know what they think about memes and how we should go about modifying rule 2. The memes will not take over the subreddit because moderators are here to ensure that the subreddit remains a usable platform. This involves not letting one type of content flood the page, however you'll certainly see more memes around unless you filter out the Humor flair. I'm hoping to bring these filters to new reddit in the coming days in some shape or form. Don't worry though, if history taught us anything, next year people will complain about abundance of memes, and we'll have to revisit this topic. For the 3rd or 4th time in the past 7 years.</TEXT>

Nowhere in the post above can you find my opinion on this topic. Try reading comments before you reply to them. Won't respond to your flaming but please do not misquote me, I have never said pkers are "the worst of the community". I said "pkers are the worst this community has to offer".

    <TEXT>Short answer: Graphics glitch in the new client (NXT). Long answer: Gems and some other items such as primal weapons, inferno adze, sceptre of the gods, and flameburst defender are painted with what's called a "specular texture", which basically makes them shiny and reflective on the surface. This special texture worked properly in the old Java client but it was not fixed for the NXT client. That's why these items display incorrect colours, often taking on the colours of the skybox. That's for example why gems dropped on the ground in slayer tower lose all colour, and it's why primal weapons are blue in sunny places. ETA fix: unknown.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. The problem was always that it couldn't be fixed for NXT without making it look bad on Java, and vice versa. But the old client was phased out last year. I don't know why specular textures still haven't been fixed after all this time. I'll tag Mod Dark /u/darkimmortal, maybe he knows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK, let's clear some things up. **Firstly,** if your account was created a long time ago (before 2010) you will use a name to log in, not an email address. Your account could have had an email associated with it (for registration, now-removed recovery questions etc.) but you will need to remember your first ever username and that's your login. If you forgot your name, read here: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206811825-Forgotten-login Note that this login name is different to your in-game name ("display name") which can be changed now. **Secondly,** not sure you're aware - there are two versions of RuneScape now: the Oldschool RuneScape and the RuneScape 3. On the oldschool game everyone starts fresh (on tutorial island with no stats/items). It's a separate retro server which uses the same accounts but on a different save. See /r/2007scape which is the subreddit for that game. Your items on your old account will be there on the modern game, RuneScape 3. You can use a single account to play both games, even with the same membership (and you will have different stats/items on the two game versions). Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.</TEXT>

Yes You can also use the same account to play oldschool (if you do remember your login/password and recover the account - it's worth it) because no matter what, everyone starts on tutorial island in the oldschool retro game. Additionally in oldschool every Easter you can obtain all Easter holiday items so you can get an Easter ring back eventually. Same for Xmas and H'ween items too.  gt;Thanks for the super quick response, you guys at Jagex are honestly so fantastic!! Haha I'm not Jagex staff, just helping out on the subreddit.

    <TEXT>Yeah well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. Quit dissing Trouble Brewing. It's a non-combat masterpiece. Axing minigames makes no sense. It's not a solution. I do however agree that 1) minigames need one themed world each 2) all minigames need to start in 1 vs 1 3) ideally minigames need to be on an instance shard world, so you could enter from any world and then get grouped with other people who want to play, that would be about the only way to get games going for some of these (unfortunately turning minigames into instanced play is a substantial technical job) 4) minigame rewards need to get better, perhaps through new thaler rewards Also forget about profound going back to trimmed completion, Jagex hates minigames and it's not changing unless player demand for this type of content reappears. And the type of player to support revival of minigames is almost gone from the game. Most of them have moved on due to EoC. The rs3 pvmer zoomers won't even read what you have to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Training Divination in the Hall of Memories yields memory shards which can be used to create signs of the porter IV's for free. These come handy for Archaeology training in remote excavation sites. Quite possible they'll be useful in Orthen. Also if you wish to speculate, there's currently an Archaeology material called orthenglass which might or might not become more useful in the near future...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>20% of the players online are playing through Steam. It doesn't mean those are the players who came from the Steam release though. Player numbers in the second half of this week are about 10% higher than those from last week. Other factors at play here could be the Amazon Prime promo or the imminent Orthen release. Any increase is optimistic but it will take longer than a few days to see what the impact of the Steam release is.</TEXT>
