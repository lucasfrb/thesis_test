    <TEXT>True, stock Android is the best type. The Pixel is a step in the right direction. I guess it's up to personal preference. I prefer having one really good official app, rather than having third party developers having to make client apps because the stock one is badly designed or buggy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hit the nail on the head there. Android really needs to catch up when it comes to messaging. Needs a universal standard that all the manufacturers can use. A new Google messaging app or something. Because iMessage is awesome. And for better or worse, some people do stay with Apple because of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LOVED the movie. Everything I could have hoped for! - Controversial choice maybe, but I thought Karen was fantastic! Funny and super cool. Likewise for all the new suit-tech. - The Vulture twist towards the end was fantastic, did not see it coming, pretty sure my jaw dropped (heard a few gasps in the cinema too) -Awesome character moment for Peter when he tried to stop the Vulture carrying away the scrap metal because his wing suit was about to overload and blow up. Also really nice to see that in jail (in the mid credits scene), Toomes didn #8217;t reveal Spidey #8217;s identity. Shows some humanity. - The Cap end credits scene was hilarious, and it #8217;s one of my favourite Marvel end credits sequences simply because it was so pointless Roll on more MCU Spidey! Tom Holland killed it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was extremely underwhelmed. They played it far too safe. Anytime anything remotely interesting threatened to happen, they cut it short. - Holy shit! Leia just got blown into space... hang on, she #8217;s alive and she can fly now? - Kylo shifted sides! This fight scene is awesome... oh wait, now he #8217;s bad again. - Wait, so Luke turned against his students and tried to kill them all in a fit of jealous rage? Wow, maybe the hero we #8217;ve known and loved all these years is flawed and was pulled towards the dark side... ah, Kylo is bullshitting us and that wasn #8217;t what happened at all. - 2 years of speculation on Rey #8217;s parents... oh, they were nobody. - I bet Snoke is gonna be so badass, can #8217;t wait to find out more about him... killed off pathetically after 10mins of screen time. - Luke is back on the battlefield! He #8217;s gonna kick so much ass... it was just a projection and oh look, he #8217;s dead now I guess? - Finn is sacrificing himself for the resistance!... damn, he #8217;s pushed out of the way at the last minute. - BB-9E looks really cool, can #8217;t wait to see what he does in the film... oh right, he does sweet fuck all - Don #8217;t even get me started on the ridiculous game of cat and mouse that the resistance played all the way through the movie. Repetition beyond belief. It was an entertaining popcorn flick, but I expect so much more than that from a Star Wars film, and unfortunately, there just weren #8217;t any surprises here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, game is unbelievably good. I #8217;ve been a massive fan all my life and the game feels like a love letter to Spidey fans! I have two tweaks I #8217;d love to see implemented. First of all, a quicker way to get to photo mode, if possible. Like a button that would bring it up straight away rather than going into the pause menu and selecting it. Secondly, moving the camera up and down in photo mode using L2/R2 is incredibly twitchy and difficult to do. Could the speed maybe be tweaked and slowed down?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah, the OLED never hurt my eyes. Reasons I wanted to switch? Size was nicer, colours were a lot more visually appealing, better battery and I prefer the single lens camera - much cleaner looking on the back of the phone, but mainly because I love the look of the portrait mode photos, they use the wide angle lens instead of the telephoto, so you get a better depth effect and can fit more in the frame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go for the XR. Better size, better internals, better choice of colours, better camera, better battery. I was also really worried about losing 3D Touch, but have found that I didn #8217;t use it as much as I thought. The keyboard cursor was a big concern, but a long press on the space bar allows this on the XR. You don #8217;t get the fancy  #8216;press in harder to highlight #8217;, but you can still highlight by tapping on the screen with your other finger when controlling the cursor. Try it on your current phone, just disable 3D Touch in the settings menu, see how you cope. And in the upcoming update, they #8217;re allowing you to expand notifications with a long press too.  #8216;Haptic touch #8217; may be the 3D replacement on the 2019 lineup as well. It #8217;s just as good and doesn #8217;t cost Apple money to implement. I think you #8217;ll be fine without it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s exactly the same! It #8217;s fantastic. Hell, I even like the way the colours are produced by the LCD a little better. I think. Smart HDR is here in all it #8217;s glory, still one of the most impressive advances in smartphone photography in recent years. The lack of telephoto lens doesn #8217;t bother me, I didn #8217;t use it much. And of course, the XR is still able to do portrait mode. I love the way portrait mode uses the wide angle lens, fits more in the frame and the effect is professional and convincing. Also, compared to the dual lens setup on the Xs, it #8217;s a slightly more impressive use of technology to me, I #8217;ve always been a fan of the way the Google Pixel could do this. In short, the camera is a technical marvel and produces great photos every time. Easily up there with the Xs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Performance management doesn #8217;t necessarily turn on at 95%. I #8217;ve had iPhones that have reached 89/90% before enabling Performance Management. It #8217;s enabled whenever the phone shuts down unexpectedly because the processor tried to draw more power than the battery could put out. A battery that is consumed (has reached under 80%) will always have performance management turned on, for obvious reasons - the battery can not cope. But if it #8217;s enabled before 80%, it can absolutely be down to a software problem, related to power management.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, speaking as a technician from an Apple Store, I would say to expect your battery not to drop by *two percent* in the first 4 months of usage is a little unrealistic. Again, if we do the maths, you #8217;re expecting quite a lot from a consumable part. And I #8217;m not saying you #8217;re disputing how they work, just that you tried to back up your claim about bringing a 98% battery in by stating something that isn #8217;t true. I #8217;m just clarifying how the battery actually works and what people should expect from them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So far, Beatsaber has had most of my time, but I #8217;m playing SuperHot tonight, expecting that to take the win- been looking forward to it for ages, figure this is the time to jump in and try it. App wise, try Bigscreen. It #8217;s free, let #8217;s you pop in and out of various virtual theatres and interact with other people watching TV shows and movies that #8217;s they #8217;ve streamed from their PC #8217;s. I #8217;m a massive cinema fan, so this virtual cinema vibe is fantastic. Bigscreen are even going to be running 3D Movie Nights soon, everyone gathers in the lobby and goes in to watch a movie together in VR, looks great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was clear that a lot of effort went into making the film, the animation was incredible and they tried their best at an emotional ending, but I was very let down. Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending to the franchise. This film felt unnecessary, like they just decided they could make another one, which is something I was worried about. It didn #8217;t feel like they planned it all along, they just tacked it on. It really didn #8217;t add much to the series. It was also pretty repetitive, with a ton of backtracking. Clearly this was Woody #8217;s story, but I wasn #8217;t a fan of how the other toys took a backseat, especially Buzz. The new toys were decent, but fans of the franchise want to see the toys they grew up watching! And the ending was very disappointing. Woody leaving the other toys behind was, I feel, a bit out of character for him. He #8217;s always been the toy to stress that being there for a kid is the most important thing. To have him suddenly change his mind to stay with Bo was frustrating. And I didn #8217;t feel like there was much emotional punch, with a rushed goodbye. It just ruined the ending of Toy Story 3 for me, which was perfect. All the toys, together with a new kid (another thing that annoyed me was the fact that they instantly showed that Bonnie doesn #8217;t even play with Woody that much, again, backtracking on the great ending that TS3 gave us).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seen the film twice and can #8217;t help but gush about how much I loved Mysterio. I #8217;ve been waiting to see Mysterio on the big screen since I was a little kid. He was always my favourite in the cartoons, and I remember thinking it would be so cool to see him in live action, but I #8217;ll admit I was excited, but apprehensive - what if they fuck him up?? But they nailed it! Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely killed it. I loved everything about this take on the character, from the motion capture suit, to the drone technology he used, to the psychotic undertone, to the INCREDIBLE illusion sequences... like seriously, it was like something off a comic book page. It was an extremely faithful portrayal of the character. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Couldn #8217;t be happier. Easily my favourite MCU villain. Yes, I liked him even more than Thanos. I really hope they bring him back, they can do so much with him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two of my favourite horror movies! The Hereditary one is OOP I believe, but you still get the 4K Cabin in the Woods steel for  #163;15 on Zavvi if you use the  #8216;REDDIT #8217; discount code! https://www.zavvi.com/blu-ray/cabin-in-the-woods-4k-ultra-hd-includes-blu-ray-version-zavvi-exclusive-steelbook/11800627.html</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Seriously impressed!</TITLE>

    <TEXT>As a long time gamer, and massive tech enthusiast, I #8217;ve tried just about every cloud gaming service you can imagine, and I have to say, I #8217;m seriously impressed with Stadia! I #8217;ve jumped on since it #8217;s went free to play, and ended up deciding to keep my Pro membership for the free games (which have been pretty decent so far) and I bought The Division 2 on sale for  #163;8. I think it really sealed the deal for me. My internet connection is pretty basic, about 35 up and 10 down, and Stadia has ran great on my MacBook Pro. Playing Division 2 in 1080p 60FPS in bed is pretty great. However, some room are better than others. When I go into my kitchen, I #8217;ve noticed that it stutters a bit. Not a big deal, but this has made me think about options for better signal strength and coverage. I #8217;m considering buying the Google Nest WiFi system, to replace my standard EE WiFi modem, in the hopes of a better all-round experience. Anybody using Nest WiFi able to share their experiences with me? Also, considering buying the ChromeCast Ultra and Stadia Controller to play in 4K on my TV. The option of hardwiring the CCU using Ethernet makes me think this will be a great way to play, would I be right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not a KB+M player, I prefer controller, so that #8217;s OK. And I generally only use one internet enabled device at a time, and have taken steps to clean up my network usage across the limited number of devices I own. Having said that, if it #8217;s not able to hit 4K reliably, does Stadia use dynamic resolution to scale back the resolution instead of stuttering? Or do have to change a setting and restart the game?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been playing Stadia on and off since the free Pro membership launched, and found that when it worked, it was incredible. So I decided to work on my home networking, bought the Nest WiFi system after a few people on here recommended it. After 2 days of using it, my experience has been noticeably better, so I committed and bought a CCU and Stadia Controller. Firmly convinced Stadia is the way forward.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, the Chromecast and controller came to just over  #163;100 and the Nest WiFi pack is an obvious step up to my networking setup, rather than just a purchase I made for Stadia. I had been wanting a better router for a long time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I already have a PS4, but as a tech enthusiast, I #8217;m fascinated by cloud gaming and from my limited testing, thought Google done it best. The mesh network was something I #8217;d wanted for a while, as I loved playing Stadia on my laptop in bed. The chromecast and controller were just extras I wanted to pick up, glad I did! The speed and convenience of gaming on Stadia have really impressed me!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My internet is roughly 35/10. Fairly average, but it definitely gets the job done. Problem was, in certain rooms, the signal was pretty weak, and Stadia suffered. Since picking up the Nest WiFi and setting up a mesh network, speeds are far more consistent throughout my apartment, and the experience has been noticeably better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say it #8217;s a nice mix of both. It #8217;s a great controller. I #8217;d heard average reviews, but I soon as I took it out of the box, I loved it. Very comfortable, good size, feels weighty, solid build, great buttons, and a good vibration motor. I think it #8217;s one of the nicest controllers I #8217;ve used!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t wait for Part II on Friday! But I can #8217;t help but feel a little worried about the framerate. Like many of you, I #8217;ve been playing through TLOU again before the sequel, and I #8217;ve been playing in buttery smooth 60fps on PS4 Pro. With the confirmation that TLOU2 runs at 30fps, I tried locking the first game to 30fps in the settings and the difference is shocking. It looks so choppy! I #8217;m sure I #8217;ll get used to it in TLOU2, but I hope I haven #8217;t ruined the experience for myself by playing the first game again!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got these and I #8217;ve put them through a lot of hours of gaming, they are INCREDIBLE! Sound quality is great, the THX Spatial Audio makes for a really immersive experience. The RGB lighting is fun to play around with, they #8217;re super comfortable, the build quality is fantastic, and the Hypersense haptics are a serious game changer. I feel like I #8217;m missing out when I don #8217;t play with them now. The vibrations really add a lot to the experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, going to any retail store is a crap shoot at the moment, we #8217;re still going through a global pandemic. Apple of all stores is bound to be busy, so a wait time is expected, to keep you safe and to keep the staff safe. There #8217;s no point in cramming everyone into the store at once, just because you can #8217;t be bothered to wait an hour or two. Give these guys a break, they #8217;re doing their best, in an unprecedented time. They come to work every day, to provide the best service they can. If you don #8217;t want to deal with them, order online.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anbody tried the Spatial Audio yet?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 00:13:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was really excited for spatial audio on AirPods Pro, but having tested it for 30mins with the Apple TV app, I #8217;m not sure how I feel. It makes everything sound more tinny, but also, unless I move my head from side to side, I can #8217;t really hear much directional audio going on. If I move my head left and right, the sound definitely seems anchored to my iPhone, but if I keep my head straight, sound doesn #8217;t seem to come from left or right as it should. It all sounds focused in the centre channel. Anybody else having this experience? Also, no matter where I move my iPhone, the sound doesn #8217;t move with it, only if I move my head. I was under the impression moving the iPhone would also effect the audio direction.</TEXT>
