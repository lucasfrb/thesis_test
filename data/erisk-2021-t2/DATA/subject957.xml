    <TITLE>It hurts. It hurts so bad. NSFW.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-26 06:58:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been two days since you left me alone in our formerly shared apartment to finish packing my things. You moved to another state, and me back to my parents'. It turns out, being without you hurts even more than being with you. We spent two and a half tumultuous, exciting, mindblowingly wonderful years together. We moved in with each other almost from the beginning and carried on with each other as if we were married. We adopted a pair of cats, we went mattress shopping, I got pregnant by accident and we aborted... and then it happened again and I carried our son to term. He's so beautiful. He looks just like us in so many ways. He was a symbol of everything that we had done together. We really had done it all. We moved to a state together that neither of us had been to, and we dedicated our lives to each other in every way we could. We worked a shady job together, we were scammed, we survived on nothing but your massive Soylent surplus for almost four months when we were both unemployed and surviving only on what we could scrape together. We did Game Jams together, we went to all those board game meetups, we listened to the Chicago Police scanner together for nights on end, we visited my abandoned childhood home. We showed each other every facet of the things we knew and loved as if we both crawled into the same skin for warmth and curled up by the fire. We were a team. Never before have I felt so comfortable with another person. It was a bulletproof bond fostered by a no-limits sharing of every single insecurity and bodily function we had. I gave you a Christmas so elaborate and thought out that you said it was the best you had in your life, as if I truly knew you more than even your family. You were right: I gave our boy up because I knew the truth. You thought you had me fooled but you didn't. I loved you more than I loved myself, and I overlooked those shitty things at my own expense so I didn't have to be without you. It hurt so bad. Every time you spit on me it hurt just as bad as it did when you hit me or wrapped your hands around my throat and threatened to murder me on the spot. Every time you cheated it hurt even more. I caught you so many times and every single time you'd rush home to comfort me and I'd sweep it under the rug because it hurt so bad that I didn't have the strength to let go. I drank heavily and abused our medications to strip away the pain so that all I was left with was the love I had for you. I knew your cheating was even worse than I called you out for. You'd beg for back rubs and all I could feel was pain. It felt like gritty sandpaper against my skin, a burn that shook through to my feet and tingled against my shoulders before rushing up to suck the color from my face and freezing solid in my brain. When we cuddled I felt the walls closing in, every breath more laborious than the last. I couldn't take care of myself or do my chores because it hurt so bad to even exist. I fucking knew you had no intention of staying loyal from day one. I knew about your nonstop dating site habit and how you'd run right back online after every time I'd call you out. I knew you were fucking every person with a vagina you came into contact with. I knew about your friend who you would continually hardcore flirt with and get nudes from. You'd tell her she'd look better naked and you'd share photos of teenagers you thought were hot and how much you missed having sex with her. You'd tell all of your friends how "insane" and "unstable" I was, making sure to gaslight me to the point where I wasn't allowed to react to anything anymore. "You overreacted and embarrassed me in front of my friends!" Screw you, dude. Nothing was off limits to you. You'd stop at nothing just to backstab me with the biggest knife you had, to cram it into any vertebrae and twist it as hard as you could. You never really loved me and I knew that from day one. Our whole relationship was a lie and I was only in your life because you didn't want to be alone. You even said that to a friend. You told another you only wanted me because you thought the sex was good. You sat there and Googled things like "my girlfriend thinks I'm cheating but I'm not" and "how to break into an iPhone 5 (my phone at the time)" without a single thought in your head suggesting you might be wrong. Seriously? You were projecting that hard? Fuck you! And I'm not surprised you stopped wanting to be intimate with me either, after all the times you busted your load to porn about cheating and nudes from the very friends who told you I was being "crazy" for no reason. I'm lying here in bed at my parents' house just seething with rage and begging for revenge. But I also miss you so bad. You're ignoring me after I made that post on Facebook proving to your friends and family what an ass you are. And I somehow still regret it. How the hell can I regret it? I'm equal parts infuriated and lovesick and it turns out that it hurts even more than when we were still together and you were still pulling all of that crap. It hurts so bad.</TEXT>

Half the posts are like:  gt;Why is my (24M) GF (17F) so immature?  gt;Boyfriend doesn't let me go to his house, won't let me meet his parents, lives with ex because they're co-parenting. How do I make him less shy? :)) And so on. It's really hard to give any advice other than "dude, dump them wtf" to people who can't see the writing on the wall in the first place. I get there's a certain amount of abuse that you become blind to but there comes a point when you really doubt a lot of these people have any amount of emotional intelligence at all. Being nice to abusers won't make them change. What advice people come to that subreddit looking for is beyond me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Autism, PTSD, ADHD. The childhood trauma definitely played a factor but it was an ex many years after my diagnosis that caused it to rear its ugly head. He'd constantly force sexual pictures of 80-90 lb girls onto me which started the disordered eating but it was a pregnancy that he forced me to go through and the trauma it inflicted onto my body that turned it full force. There was no gradient. I went from feeling insecure about my body but eating what I wanted to the binge-restrict hell I'm in now. And the worst part? I GAINED weight since the disordered eating began.</TEXT>

"We're all humans and we make mistakes tee hee! :)" is one of the oldest and shittiest ways of sweeping actions like cheating under the rug there is. Being human is not an excuse. Do better.

    <TEXT>I completely agree. The ideal is so hard to achieve without tons of surgery unless you've got really specific genes. I haven't met very many people who have a flat belly but big thighs and boobs, and it's really irritating to see people act like this is a better standard. Rather than just people over a certain size, it's now alienating nearly everyone. It's nice we're appreciating larger people, but I wish it wasn't just this one single body type. I like bellies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I don't eat a lot for dinner, My stepdad loudly jokes about me "watching (your) girlish figure". I never lived with him until a year ago so I didn't tell him about my disorder but I think it's his way of letting me know he's onto me. It makes me panic to hear though. Every time I'd go visit family in my hometown, I'd hear one of two things: "Have you lost weight? You look great." or "Have you gained weight? You look great." Both fuel me equally as much, except one taught me patience and the other taught me pain. Nothing freaks me out quite like, "Your metabolism won't be so fast forever! Just wait until you hit 30. You won't be able to eat without gaining weight", like I know it's total Fat Logic but shit Deborah, I really wish you'd shut up before I have a panic attack right in the middle of this Outback Steakhouse!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was vehemently against drugs when I was younger, too the point of feeling like I was better than everyone else because of it. Around 19 years old, I started dating a guy who was very pro-drug and would make me feel like absolute garbage for not doing drugs like the girls he was attracted to. He'd force them on me, mainly prescriptions and DXM. At one point he even forced a double dose of Lorazepam down my throat to make me compliant. My life spiraled after this, leaving me in a really fragile state where I was completely unaware of my surroundings. I've recovered from that fog, but I'm 22 and I now abuse anything I can get my hands on. Even if it's just to make myself sick and not high, I'm constantly on the run from the way I feel inside. That said, I'm still not crazy about drugs. But I've taken an approach of harm reduction and instead encourage people to do their research and be sure that they're stable enough and fully aware of what they're doing. They let you explore the depths of the mind and the imagination.</TEXT>

Hating myself has become so second nature that I haven't even realized I'm not being nice to myself.

He's spending his life jumping from hobby to hobby, moving from state to state, woman to woman, shell of a personality to shell of a personality, job to job in a career he's honestly not very good at, hoping that something will make him feel less empty. I know he's hurt me so fucking much and the wounds are still fresh a year and a half later but I still don't want him to suffer. Him being a narcissist is his mom's fault. Maybe I do want these feelings directed at me I guess. I can see what few parts of him are real and I probably know more about him than anyone else on earth.

    <TEXT>I do that. If I'm awake and around and my stepdad's asleep my biological mom decides that's the only time she wants to talk to me. Walks into my room (she uses half for storage, when stepdad asked her to clear her shit out of the closet so I don't have to keep my clothes on a rack in my tiny little room and she screamed and threatened to kill herself, claimed we all hated her and that we were all bad people) just to wander around and literally babble about nonsense "I can't find this thing (fake heavy breathing and panting), I can't, I can't. I can't find it, you know that? You know that? Sometimes you just gotta do what you have to do, and I can't find this thing, honey. I'm so sick, I don't feel good". It's an incoherent mixture of fake platitudes, claiming to be dying, and saying random phrases like "you know that?" to fill conversational air because she can't spend a single second alone. If it's not that, she's talking my head off about my siblings. One of them is also a narc and the other one and her much older husband pulled a lot of horrible crap because my adoptive family dared to set boundaries, and I'm not ready to forgive it nor should I feel like I need to force myself to. Anyway, she just talks about them all day. Neither one are good people. Never talks about me, asks about me, and when she is it's her pretending to love my hobbies ("Yeah I love [insert game here] haha, I'm a gamer" despite never playing a game a day in her life) or talk about how I'm TOTALLY her. Ugh. Sorry for the text wall. Anyway, I'm in bed by 7 pm and I'm up all night just so I don't have to see or talk to her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My biological mom's like that. She constantly expects me to wear clothes that don't suit my style and frankly make me uncomfortable (pushing size 4 jeans when I wear only men's jeans, and double that size, tight shirts despite knowing about my body issues and also the fact that I don't wear women's clothing), tries to push me into having kids, tries to set me up with guys over a decade older (despite knowing that vehemently against age gap relationships for people my age??). Actually, I'll talk about that for a second. Over the summer, she and this other narc try to get me to marry the other narc's son. I've never met him, I'm 22 and he's like 35, he's been married twice and abusive to both, and she was gonna try to ship me out there to live with them and marry him that very day. Yeah, NO. She also tries to compete with me, but not really. She's really let herself go, like a sip of water a week and eating crap nonstop. Tells me all the time that she was a size zero at my age, and how skinny she was and how I'm gonna look like her someday. I have a diagnosed eating disorder and she's over here bragging about how great she says she looked at my age and how I'm gonna grow up to look horrible in a few years.</TEXT>

I can't focus worth a damn, but if I'm actively looking for a solution to a problem I'm having then I'll plug away for hours.

    <TEXT>Peanut butter for sure. It's good and all, but there's no way I could just sit there and eat a jar of the stuff. It stuffs my mouth up and makes it all gunky and hard to swallow. The same goes for other things like Nutella and cookie butter. Sugary things in general, really. I've got bad teeth that cry if I drink water that's colder than tap, so I avoid sugar like the plague. Plus, after switching all of my drinks to zero cal I've lost the taste for most sweets. If I do eat then, it's part of a binge rather than the binge itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Went on an all day shopping trip, burned a whole day's worth (for me anyway) of calories. I binged yesterday, so skipping around sipping on Coke Zero felt really good. I thought, sweet. Binge week is over and we can go back to pretending we've never eaten a calorie in our life and I can finally stop getting a pound bigger every time I look at the stupid scale. I planned to go home, and make that the start of a fast. Nope. Stepdad took us to a buffet. I intended to stick to salad but I'm so obsessed with not wasting anything that I always eat more than my money's worth. It's a deeply ingrained compulsion. I ate six plates. No matter how much I ate I never got full, so I kept going. And going. And going. Impact hit once I got in the car and I was in so much pain that I was barely able to form words. Came home and flung myself into bed and slept for six hours. I still feel full to the point of feeling sick. Didn't bother to log it, just made a custom entry for 6,000 calories and called it "FUCK YOU YOU FAT FUCK!!!!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading through this, I saw a lot of myself in it. We're around the same age (I'm 22) and both diagnosed at 17 because we were girls. I mean, I'm not all that smart, barely graduated high school and a NEET who's never went to college but I came from a lifetime of trauma, neglect, foster care, I even stim with the swingset too. I can't drive, struggle with games due to poor motor skills (though I play them and love them anyway), came from a rural town of around 600 people, been through a series of abusive relationships (including, like you, one where I left everything I knew to be with him but I was 18) too and my trauma makes me feel lost out in the adult world. Just thrown off the ship in shark infested waters and expected to swim. I'm seriously amazed at how much we have in common. Even when we feel like the only people in earth I we're still never truly alone I guess. I seriously hope for the best for you out there. You're really eloquent, brilliant, just fantastic at expressing yourself in words, something a lot of us really struggle with.</TEXT>

I reminded her that we have a back-up cam and she flew off the handle and threatened to hang herself. She knows I have a history of attempts, so she uses it as a tool to try to make me feel bad even though I totally don't. Craziest part? She claimed she did it because she was "uncomfortable".</TEXT>

So I put mine up for adoption (I was too young, fleeing domestic violence, of course she doesn't care) she went nuts begging for attention because of her "loss". Older sister and fellow narc had her kid taken, mom goes off about her "loss". Youngest sister has a kid with a much older guy (not a good situation, stop trying to force me into thinking it's okay!) and she's now our mother's favorite. Can't stop talking about her. Baby this, baby that. She insists on shoehorning herselves into our kids and acting like they're hers. Boo hoo me, I'm such a victim. It's like she doesn't care about any of us outside of our ability to reproduce. Older brother is a guy. Guess who she almost literally never talks about? Hmm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up surrounded by narcs. Becoming one myself is one of my biggest fears. I question my motives for everything. Am I struggling to do [thing] because of depression, or am I trying to manipulate someone else into doing it? Why am I upset about [thing]? Is this a legitimate slight or am I just upset because I'm losing control of others? Is my lack of sense of self because I'm chronically empty and don't know it, or is it because I never had the chance to develop one? My boyfriend (son of a narc mom) and I talk about it often, but he insists that my self awareness means I can't possibly be a narcissist. Promises that my lack of interest in having kids is because I'm smart enough to know I shouldn't do it until I have my head screwed on straight. I still don't believe him though. What if my facade is just really, really good?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel chronically doomed. It sucks all of the life out of me and leaves me with no belief in myself or the future. I'll lie here in bed and rot surrounded by her hoard of baby clothes and other assorted nonsense and filth, her dog crapping all over all of my things, listening to her scream, only being talked to when her usual supplies are drained or sleeping. Forever a slave to a woman who claims to be my mother, who doesn't actually feel love for anyone, let alone me. I feel myself staring up at the peak of this mountain I'll never see the end of, knowing that I have to try because I'm the only one who can. The top of that mountain represents my freedom. I look up it and feel the contents of my body sink into my feet. I'm a tough person, but it only gets harder every hour and I'm getting so worn out. It takes me days to convince myself to shower. Hope things eventually look up for the both of us. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.</TEXT>

My sisters were her golden kids though, and that's what it comes down to. Older one's a narc like her, and the younger one is innocent and easy to manipulate. Growing up, I was more resistant to her games and I tended to side with relatives that she disliked so I'm one of her two forgotten ones. When she talks to me, it's either because my siblings/stepdad are busy or she wants to scream. It's whatever. Narcs pick favorites.</TEXT>

Not eating for days, weeks, sometimes a month or more at a time in order to lose weight? Apparently, totally okay if you claim it's for health. Incredible. It's the quackery of the week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That phrase "absence makes the heart grow fonder" absolutely applies here. My ex and I once wound up both unemployed without warning and we had to live off of his huge stash of Soylent for months. Three or four months of only Soylent, no food. The first real meal I had was roasted chicken and the flavor was so powerful and delicious that I cried, despite being neutral to the food before. I spend days, weeks contemplating my next meal so when I finally get it, it really counts. And I eat less, so I eat slower and get to really appreciate the flavor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tell myself all the time that as a kid I was fine, but the problems were definitely there. I had a healthy relationship with food as a little kid. I had my own garden, cooked delicious meals with my grandma (I remember saut #233;ing mushrooms at 6 or 7 for my spaghetti and her gushing over how proud she was). My parents divorced, I went with my mom and was neglected to the point of being taken by CPS at 10. I would go weeks without eating a whole meal, making sure my little sister ate over me. After an emergency removal from one placement, the new family we were placed with commented on how rail thin I was. They made us delicious chili from scratch, down to the sauce and upon eating it my body instantly rejected it. The next morning, maple bacon and eggs, it went the same way. It took months to put my stomach back into a normal state. Two placements later, we wind up with my now adoptive family and things start going the other direction. My adoptive dad loves food and we're very poor so we eat what's cheap rather than what's healthy. I was put on antidepressants, and suddenly I couldn't stop binging. I started eating competitively (I won a lot of contests at the county fair and wanted to move up to the big dogs one day), demolishing whole pies in a matter of minutes and sweeping whole White Castle Crave Cases at the age of 13. The weight crept on, and despite never becoming overweight the fluctuations ruined my body. I stopped wearing shorts. I started becoming more self conscious, but I told myself I was fine for years until I was 19 and developed an addiction to Adderall, and later starving. I blame adult me, but I know it's been a long time coming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know, I'm not really sure. I guess I've never really thought about it. I've always been five pounds or so shy of overweight and been uncomfortable with my body but still okay. I think it started with wanting to fit into knee/thigh high socks, leggings, tights. My calves are much bigger than average, even when I was 13 or so and they're very tender. It takes no pressure at all to cut off circulation. I had to wear plus size tights back when I was a US size 4 pant. I was dating a guy at the time who constantly forced pictures of 70-90 lb e-girls he was talking to onto me so I wanted to shrink to nothing so he'd stop hurting me, so he'd love me instead of telling me I was fat. After that, I experienced serious changes to my body (same guy forced himself onto me immediately after I broke up with him and made me stay with him for the pregnancy, birth, and adoption) leaving me with diastasis recti, a separation of abdominal muscles that can only be kind of mitigated. I have a big apron of stretch marks and horror, skin my abdomen isn't able to carry so it's just warped flab. I didn't recognize my body anymore, just wanted to starve in hopes that one day I would again. I left him and am with someone who genuinely cares now, but the desire to shrink to nothing still exists. Maybe it's Peter Pan Syndrome. Maybe I hope it kills me. Maybe I want to make my illnesses more visually important so people will take them seriously. Maybe I want to fill the role my ex wanted to be as a coping mechanism. Could be a need for control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. My mom's SO progressive until she actually has to care. My mom is soooo supportive of the fact that I'm struggling with my gender identity. So she tries to marry me off to a total stranger who was looking for a girl to parade around and do his chores for him. Acts completely disgusted by the fact that I like women as much as men. Tries to thrust makeup on me, clothes I'd never wear (including pants four to five sizes smaller than I fit in despite openly telling her about my eating disorder). Favors the daughters she has who have kids and treats them like gods on earth even though both are terrible moms. It's just... exhausting. If I weren't adopted at 13 I don't think I would have survived. My adoptive mom and I are tight as they come.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really is incredible. I hung out with my high school sweetheart a few weeks ago and was really embarrassed about how fat I thought I was. I tried my hardest not to talk about it, but he saw right through me. He pulled up a photo of me at 19, what I thought was the "golden age" for my body. Concerned, he says, "I don't know what you're seeing. Because you look the same. You might have a little looser belly skin, but you're shaped the same." That photo blew me away. I legitimately didn't realize how warped my perception of my body was, always certain that I really was as ugly as I saw myself as.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tend to be a very prideful, quiet person. I mean, I use a lot of self depricating humor but I close others off from how bad my mental health is. My brand of isolation is almost aggressive, friends won't hear from me in months as I silently self destruct in a corner. I grew up severely neglected, and my only role model had walls up in order to protect herself as well. No one would listen if I had a problem, so I kept it to myself and hoped the pain would go away. And yet, sometimes I do wonder if I want someone to worry. The idea of someone commenting on my habits is mortifying, but at times I also fantasize about people commenting on it. I'm afraid of reaching out because I'm afraid of rejection or looking like an attention seeker, but if I were 90 lbs people might take my other illnesses more seriously. I don't know. It's not the main reason but it's probably a factor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried to stand to pee from the ages of six to eight. I seriously thought it was the way every grown up did it and that it was a skill you had to master rather than something you need different anatomy for. I used a male OC to represent myself online starting at the age of maybe eleven, and when asked why I did that I didn't know what to say. I told them that something about men was "comfortable". I couldn't place my finger on why or what about it made me feel that way, but I felt jealous. I wanted to be a guy too. Growing up, I clung uncomfortably close to my male peers. I thought the attachment was romantic, so I pursued them but I just wanted the closeness. I wanted to see how they lived, feel their skin, mentally place myself into their bodies. I felt so creepy and slimy for having these thoughts, so I socially retreated. I didn't feel like I belonged. I was filled with this terrifying sense of longing, knowing that I wanted to be a guy more than anything but not thinking that I had options. I hid everything about myself from everyone, instead constructing this male persona online that I used to express myself. I thought this was normal, and that everyone did it.</TEXT>

The thought of living with it forever keeps me up at night, causes panic attacks and makes me legitimately uninterested in continuing to live.

    <TEXT>Drives me up a wall. Stepdad admitted to me that he's with my mom because he feels like it's his punishment for some fault he has. He feels like she's his responsibility. I get that, but he's showing no interest in standing up for himself. He drops everything, hundreds of dollars, gives her whatever she wants and screams, literally screams, tells me I'm a shitty and hateful and horrible person when I tell her no or stand up for myself. To protect himself, he's just rolled over onto his back and gives her whatever she wants. He keeps her happy so she doesn't act out. Only person on earth who he gets onto is the one person on earth who thinks he deserves better. He lashes out because he's terrified of how hard it's gonna be to separate herself from him. He's resistant to change, and the process of separating their possessions is really daunting (she's a compulsive hoarder). He's seen the other men she's ruined. She goes down the line of submissive men, she chews him up and spits them out and he doesn't want people to think he's weak. I get it, like I REALLY do. I understand better than anyone, but I'm at wit's end. I can't keep trying to protect him from her anymore because I'm getting hurt in the crossfire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One day, in the probably pretty distant future, I hope I'll be a better parent. I'm afraid I'll turn out like her without realizing. Even considered not having any kids myself, to put a stop to the cycle. I think what makes a lot of kids of narcs different though is our self awareness. There's hope for us and our futures, at least when compared to those who think there are no problems at all. With that, you can become a great parent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that so much. My friends are always SO busy, "sorry I've been so busy haha! Life is so crazy!" but they'll post pictures of them and their cooler friends out doing fun stuff almost every day. I would have wanted to join them. They all say they're there for me, but even though I only message them good news and positive things, I get left on read or just flat ignored. What do these friends have that I don't? Are they better adjusted, have nicer homes? Better looking? All around now fun? Is it because they're neutotypical? Trying to not be invisible is exhausting. I don't even beg. I called out one friend last month. He said, "you know I've always got time for you. Just ask." I asked him, "do you really? Because I don't want to be banking on people who are only saying things like that because they want to be nice." He admitted I was right and apologized. Whether that hurt our friendship or not, I don't really care. I don't want to bank on people who don't actually like me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tend to be really quiet, self-sufficient. My older sister became a narcissist too, my younger sister unbearably histrionic. That's why our mom likes them best. It's a circle of asspats, no one can do any wrong in each other's eyes. I'm not a very social person, I just want to be alone so I've been able to separate without any real pushback. Through circumstances outside of my control, I'm living with my mom again and I can't stand it. I'm usually really gentle and polite, but the stress from living with a person who uses and abuses and my sisters not being around to feed into it I'm constantly bombarded by her need for attention, control, and possessions. I find myself becoming mean. Can't stand it, I need to get away again.</TEXT>

Hyphenated names are administrative hell, everywhere I go I feel like an alien. I have to redo so much paperwork, call to fix so many things in so many systems, like reader beware, do not hyphenate your name no matter how cute you think it looks. Babbling aside, I've gotta drop a name. I can't take this anymore, and during the adoption process they misspelled my middle name anyway. Figure while I'm there, I'd drop a last name too. But which one? I'm at the mercy of one of two families if I do that. Considered just using a whole new name but I will have to face the wrath of a thousand suns if I do that. Ugh.

    <TEXT>It's really hard to be on both sides. My disorder didn't start getting bad until I was an adult, and I remember how upset I'd get at loved ones who had EDs in the past. I couldn't wrap my head around it, it felt like a conscious choice that the person is continuing to make because they're being stubborn or something. I tried to be empathetic but I just didn't get it. How could you not like food? Why would you deprive yourself of a basic need! I think to truly understand this kind of illness 100 percent you'd have to have it. I understood the basics, but had no idea the brain consuming demon it all really is until I realized I was already in the middle of it. If he's willing, you might be able to find a YouTube video or a documentary in which people who have recovered explain. Find ones that really resonate with you. Eating disorders in people with BPD are fairly common, you may be able to find content by someone with both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. The diagnosis meant I was able to get my IEP in high school, and I was able to get the accommodations I needed to succeed like smaller class sizes and slowed down versions of classes I struggled with, as well as an extra study hall so I could have a social break. I was able to take advantage of other things like a voc rehab program that gave me the skills I needed for the workplace, and even a class where they teach you life skills like cooking and personal finance. Thanks to all of that, I was able to move out on my own without need for too many other services at 19 (though I still have a case manager just in case), and with the exception of transportation help I live independently. If you think you've got it, do what you gotta do to get tested because my diagnosis changed my life. Seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I mention any type of personality disorder the person I'm talking to turns their ears off. My mom's antics are extremely well known, but not a damned soul believes me when I say that her behavior did severe psychological damage to me. They think she's sweet, sensitive, harmless, and stupid rather than an attention seeker who destroys everything she touches. It's easier when I go in with vague terms and descriptors. People have a hard time wrapping their heads around the idea of a person who has to manufacture every aspect of themself and if you even hint that the person could be exaggerating their behavior you're seen as an asshole and a bad guy. I'm sick of being gaslit into believing that I'm the one in the wrong, that neglecting children to the point of them being taken by the state isn't abuse and wasn't her fault, of having to act like I never have any problems at all lest she try to compete over how much she thinks she has it worse, of being told that I need to forgive someone who isn't sorry and has made no efforts to improve. So I just don't talk about it to people who aren't online, or otherwise directly involved and aware. It's exhausting, and the worst part is that you have to have gone through it to believe it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same old story, every mental illness is a personality disorder in their minds. I use Reddit primarily for support groups and was banned from RBB for having an eating disorder and venting in ED support subreddits. This disorder was directly related to childhood trauma, and while I know I should use an alt for that my history posting in that sphere is enough that I'd probably have to just start over altogether. The people who need these subreddits the most can't access them because the main admin is batshit and likes to ban on a whim for no other reason other than the high it gives. And what's the deal with having to post cat photos or haikus in order to post there? It's obviously a control thing and don't even get me started on that passive aggressive attitude "you're not a good fit, sorry uwu! Come, my minions! Mommy needs ass pats" Whatever, thanks for listening to my rant.</TEXT>

I dump myself into fictional worlds, putting characters that represent myself into triggering outfits when possible and just letting myself forget about the presence of my own skin. Food becomes the last thing on my mind, until someone mentions it and the panic turns back on again. I use bowls for everything, even foods that you pick up to eat and rush through them so I can jump back into my game, drawing, or other maladaptive fantasy, and will go through obscene amounts of caffeine. I will either sleep until 2 pm or not sleep, with no in between and I'm in the bathroom for long blocks of time because I feel the compulsion to strip and weight myself every time I go in there, even if it's just to pee or wash my hands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're not transitioning because you're dysphoric, then you're doing it for the wrong reason. Transitioning in order to gain a social advantage/get rid of disadvantages, to escape from the past/trauma, because of a fetish, whatever, I've seen people do all of those and more, and that's a great way to give yourself real dysphoria. The grass is always greener and whatnot. That said, why in God's name would you start hormones when you're perfectly happy with the ones you've got? Idk, I hope I'm explaining that right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I eat junk food. Never enough to go over my calorie limit, but without the occasional chicken nugget or pizza or fry I think I'd lose my mind. High calorie sweets aren't safe for me, like the thought of eating cake freaks me out but somehow a burger of equal caloric value is fine. I also live with family and therefore eat what they eat. Eating only a salad during pasta night sets off alarm bells.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We live with my stepdad and my biological mom, so we eat meals at home. It's a lot of "eat when you're hungry", where breakfast and lunch aren't made and dinner is cooked 3 or 4 times a week. It's a terribly enabling environment for someone like me. Meals cooked at home are very calorie dense (one of my stepdad's favorites is cheddar bacon pierogis with mashed potatoes and sometimes Velveeta macaroni and cheese #8212;terrifying!) On nights when we just eat whatever, I cook somewhat elaborate meals for my boyfriend but don't usually eat myself (or I'll have some canned soup). I specialize in rice, but last night was grilled peanut butter sandwiches cut into quarters and tomato soup. I fuss so much about his food, as if it fills the foodless void in me if that makes any sense? I also make him lunch every day for work, just tons of protein because he eats like you wouldn't believe and likes meat and nuts. Usually it's a cup of peanuts, a ham or turkey sandwich with mustard, and whatever add-ins he wants that week like chips or snack cakes. I add fruit if we have it. So pretty much, it's very hands off here. We eat whenever. I can only imagine it getting worse after we move out though. I know it was bad when I lived with my ex.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find I've become more sensitive to smell in the past few years, and can be more easily satisfied by them. Confuses my family to no end. It's body spray, scented lotions, those Bath and Body Works hand sanitizers, candles, lip balm, those Tazo teas. I'm surrounded in a cloud of delicious vanilla cake all day and it's amazing. When I make my guy's lunch, I sniff the peanut butter. Before I eat dinner, it's another noseful. Super nice, but definitely super weird. Smelling is fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes I wonder if my family members talk about my eating habits when I'm not around. We take jabs at each other, like "this is Lucas. He's as anti-food as he is anti-fun" and then I call my stepdad a crotchety old Boomer and all is good, but I mean serious conversations. They don't know that I'm sick, let alone that it's been for so long. Do they tell friends? Who all knows about this? Agh!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really, most of them. I don't have the motivation to do anything, and if I do I'm not really present when I do it. Video games are an example. I do mind numbing, repetitive tasks like shiny hunting in Pok #233;mon or Turf War with a roller in Splatoon or fishing for hours at a time in Animal Crossing instead of playing through stories and getting immersed. I don't have the reflexes or critical thinking skills to get very far anyway. I'm struggling to beat games I loved as a kid. My patience is too thin for art anymore, I barely ever draw. I'm too weak for rural exploration. Haven't finished an anime in over a year. All I think about is not eating and the passage of time until the next morning so I can weigh myself again. It's terrible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The line between fasting and disordered eating is fine. I do believe in the health benefits, at least in intermittent fasting but when I eat less than 1 thousand calories for a few weeks, it's because I'm mentally ill but someone else can go a month without eating altogether and get praise. Where do they draw that line? How far is too far? Some of those posts really scare me. I worry about the people who talk about feeling sick or dizzy while doing this, or those who claim to hate their bodies and want to see change quickly. I fear for those who get angry at themselves for unconsciously tasting food while cooking a meal they weren't going to eat at all. I see too much of myself in a lot of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stuff blows my mind too. My biological mom is terrible about that. She is convinced she never eats and has no idea why she isn't "my size" (wtf lady don't say that shit, it's so triggering) but has no idea what calories are, what they do, or how many she needs. Eats more than double what she needs in snacks alone but doesn't even notice it. Convinced that occasionally eating some tomatoes or carrots, or buying Jordan's skinny syrups reverses everything eaten earlier that day. Buys into those weight loss MLMs, changes nothing, still confused. It's a numbers thing, and people don't believe me when I say that. An astonishing number of people seem to think it's total woo, just pseudoscience. So they buy these 800 calorie smoothies, drench their salads in ranch, put no effort in at the gym, don't know why they aren't seeing results. Then they come to me, convinced that I'm naturally like this, they want to know the "secret" of my metabolism, convinced it's metabolism alone and that some people can consistently eat multiple multi thousand calorie meals a day and maintain a 100 lb frame without having a tapeworm or something. Sorry about the rant. I know we aren't well enough educated about this stuff as a society, but I still feel like some people are willfully ignorant at times. I get annoyed. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! My scale is SO fucky. I set it flush with the same floor tile every time, weigh myself at the same time every day, even tried changing the batteries and it always fluctuates. Sometimes it's a few ounces, sometimes a few pounds. I sometimes take the average of the weights, or pick the one that shows up (and sometimes two or more numbers will tie) and it's just UGH. Is it busted or something? Can it be recalibrated?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like to cook for my boyfriend, but it's more because I can control his nutrition. He'll eat just about anything. It's fascinating to change what he eats and see the change in his behaviors. I give him a lot of protein in his lunch (meats and nuts) for example and he snacks less at home now. You can see the difference in his energy, he'll be in a better mood and nap less. I don't worry about calories, I just don't pack a thousand calories into his box. I like taking care of him, even when I don't take care of myself. It feels good. I figure if I have the know how I might as well use it for good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It definitely doesn't help that we wind up in a lot of cringe compilations and on "community deep dive" videos, and there are streamers who will just go into random communities live. The assumption that only other ABDLs were looking was accurate many years ago, but definitely not now. There are several groups these people like to pull content (furries, LGBT, fat acceptance, etc. are other groups) and we're one of them. The likelihood of being recognized is already much higher with more eyes, but it'll also make some people want to identify us. I know a lot of people don't care, and I do believe them. I let it all air out on my own account, with no separation of anything. It's at this point that I'd advise people who aren't established in life and without a plan B, where if you're identified it could really hurt your life, to reconsider face pics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're going to be okay even though you feel really sick now. One day won't make you gain weight, and the pain will go away. Drink some water especially if you ate a lot of salty food, do something you enjoy. Maybe watch a show you haven't seen in a long time, do a face mask, play with a pet, maybe a video game if you like those. I'm proud of you for not purging. The urges are extremely powerful and so hard to fight, and deciding to stop purging is a major step that a lot of people haven't even taken yet. You got this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I age regress entirely for therapeutic reasons. There's nothing sexual at all about it, it's just so comforting. I came from a terrible, awful childhood that's left me with PTSD and by starting over on my own terms I feel braver and more comfortable with facing the adult world. With this, I decide what I want in my childhood. It breaks my heart at times that I have to do it like this, that I'm not a real kid but a big weird adult, but I'm reclaiming my past and it feels so incredibly powerful to be able to grow up on my own terms (I still do adult things of course). The free time I spend in my head used to be so dark and terrifying, but it's slowly turning into a place of fantasy and joy. Being gentle to the child who suffered so long ago is helping me resolve those feelings of helplessness, fear, and guilt. It's a lot of rambling, I'm sorry. I think a lot of people regress for reasons like that. Additionally, some people with happy upbringings also regress. I don't know what's going on up there that would give someone like that those urges, but I think they're still equally valid and you have every right to enjoy this without it being a kink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom sees every negative emotion as an attack on her. Anger and frustration especially. If you feel pain, it's because you hate her and want her dead and she insists my childhood was perfect despite doing even less than the bare minimum. She'll attempt to reminisce (you kids loved food, you'd always fight over it), and when I get honest about it (we were fed once a week if that), it's because someone brainwashed me. Things couldn't have been bad, because the idea of people feeling emotions that aren't pre-approved is really challenging to her and therefore horrible and mean. She guilts you out of feeling every emotion that isn't in line with what she wants you to feel, or will manipulate others into thinking you're the bad guy so if they catch you feeling they'll step on you. It's vile.</TEXT>

It feels like "The Story" is a milestone I have to consider when it comes to others. The "dude, sit down. This is gonna be a novel" moment. I fantasize about just slapping it all into a movie or a game or some other medium and just giving it to people, broadcasting, whatever it takes to just make the understanding appear so I don't have to explain it all again.</TEXT>

Get over it." or "it wasn't that bad" or "my parents were shitty too and I'm just fine (he's not)". Even abuse outside of the house is totally fine, too the point that I sometimes wonder if he doesn't just say these things to be inflammatory. Their gaslighting and negging makes you feel like an idiot. If I didn't have my boyfriend and fellow narc survivor living with me I swear I'd lose it. He sees through all the BS and can relate to almost everything. It's amazing. I still get so mad that she gets away with saying whatever she wants though. You're never allowed to hold her to what she says, or to give consequences to her behavior.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every time someone calls me, the first thing I say is "did I do something wrong?" I didn't realize I even said that for years, I guess people thought it was a joke or a catchphrase or something but one day I had a caseworker call it out. She said, "why do you always ask that? I can't think of a single reason why I'd be mad at you" to which I responded, "I guess it must be force of habit". It really opened my eyes. My policing of leftovers in the house is bad too. I will not throw them away unless they're moldy or completely hard and will binge eat every leftover item in the fridge if they accumulate. I will actively think about the leftovers if they're there, to the point of struggling to sleep if I know something is spoiling and will panic after a big meal because I know some is going in the fridge. It's hell. Every time I remind people of that fact I'm reminded of just what a freak my mom has made me. Shit completely rewires your brain, makes me angry mine couldn't develop normally.</TEXT>

Growing up my sister and I were rarely fed, like she did much less than the bare minimum. If it comes up though, she screams bloody murder that she's SO important, works SO hard, that we're SO ungrateful and teaming up and attacking her (last time she screamed like a banshee for two hours because we told her not to put whole plates of food in the sink).

I watched Mickey Mouse Clubhouse until I was fourteen despite me exiting the target demographic before the CGI show was a thing, owned a Barney shirt that I wore with no shame at sixteen. I thought kids forced themselves to not enjoy those things, that everyone liked this stuff but wanted to look mature or something. Toys, cartoons that are way too young for me, all of it is so ingrained into who I am that I'm just seen as a confident, shameless toy collector. The autism helped that image. My peers were dating when I was 13-15, and I'd spend my afternoons sprawled out on the floor playing with Littlest Pet Shop pets. I was so excited to get my first job, drooling not over the makeup or electronics or nice dinners I could buy, but over Hello Kitty plushies and new Pok #233;mon games. The things I bought went further and further into baby world: My Little Ponies became coloring books, sparkly hair bows, then pacifiers. It all came to a head one day when I found myself with a pack of diapers at the store. It was so fucking weird!</TEXT>

I'm accused all the time of having selective hearing, and it's so upsetting. I really, really cant help it. People will say something and expect that it registered in my mind but I didn't even know they said something. Speech is garbled nonsense, it's like listening to someone speak a language that you only took a few months in. You pick up a few words and might be able to get the gist of what's said, but that's it.

Your parents don't need to know you like bondage or anal, much like they don't need to know about ABDL. I don't wear as a fetish and still will never tell them. Friends, however, are where it's at. Look online, find a group, find someone who's already like minded.</TEXT>

All of this, and she thinks it's completely warranted because she thinks she's been slighted, whether it's true or not. Reality is warped. Good on you for making a break for it.

    <TEXT>It happens to a lot of us. Sometimes I can eat three meals a day with snacks and be okay, and other days I l panic for hours over eating anything at all, no matter what it is. For some people, it comes in waves much like a lot of other mental illnesses. Not every person with depression experiences their symptoms all the time, for example. Some days they might do okay and others they might not. Your ED is no less valid for not being symptomatic all of the time.</TEXT>

Don't tell people to "delete the game" just because we're trying to cope and don't want to be reminded of how terrifying the world is. I've heard people saying that. Incredibly rude.

    <TEXT>Don't scream at people who aren't dedicating 100 percent of their effort and headspace towards this cause. Being mentally ill or otherwise crushed by the numerous sources of stress in this world right now (all of this, the reminder that it's Pride month and they may not have support at home, the pandemic, the deaths of loved ones due to these events are just examples) isn't "privilege", as someone I saw earlier say. Teaming up on and belittling someone who is trying to play a damn video game to cope, or making a social media post that isn't about how people are people or cops need to die isn't helping your cause, it's just making someone who's trying to live their life and get by shut down. You're crushing them with guilt, making them feel like monsters because they want one single place on this planet that isn't discussing dying or political collapse or huge capital letters. Classic response is "but not everyone gets the privilege of peace", but don't even start. You're only making it worse. Black people aren't the only ones who suffer when it comes to the police. People who are mentally ill are too, at an astonishing amount. Look it up. Don't step all over one group to get your point across about another. Keep online games a place where everyone can go. Same with spaces that are wholly unrelated to these events. When you hear people who are upset because they can't get a single second away from current events, don't tell them to delete the game/their account/themselves, or call them racists, or tell them they're horrible crybabies who hate humanity and need to get over themselves. Don't gaslight them. Because that's what's happening. Because if you're treating people like this, and then putting up a show about how much you care about mental health awareness later, you're fake as they come.</TEXT>

This method helped me all through childhood and remains a really valuable asset as an adult.

    <TEXT>Illinois is the bunghole of the Midwest. Terrible corrupt state government, taxes on top of your taxes (when I lived right along the western border I would go to Missouri for all shopping, even if it's just a gallon of milk so I don't get bean dipped by the food tax plus the higher sales tax), either you live in a small town of 4 people or Crimesville. I don't hate the state (that goes to West Virginia, fuck this place), but surrounding states really hate Illinois and it's perfectly warranted. People are leaving the state at a really impressive rate. I think they lose something like one person every fifteen minutes?

    <TEXT>Grew up with a bad relationship with food. Severe neglect until the age of 10, when I went into foster care meant I took ages to recover my ability to eat without getting sick. At 12 or 13 though, I started bingeing. At 13 I once ate a whole loaf of bread's worth of sloppy joes. Another time it was a whole White Castle Crave Case. A whole watermelon. Two Little Caesar's pizza. Add in the cocktail of psych meds and I put on 50 lbs in three or four years. To make matters worse, it turned out I have lipedema. My legs were much bigger than my peers, but it was internalized and left to fester. At 19, I moved out and developed an Adderall and caffeine habit. I'd go days without eating or sleeping, but then I realized I was losing weight doing it. I became addicted to it. I considered this the height of my body confidence and began wearing clothes I'd never even touch now. I'm 23 now and denied I had any form of dysmorphia for a long time. It wasn't until an old friend showed me a photo of myself at 19 that I realized I had a problem. I told him, "man I was so skinny then" to which he, confused and obviously worried, said "but you look the same now." We went to my adoptives' place to get my swimsuit out of storage, checked the size, sure enough. Ugh. It's relieving to know I'm not alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Worst part about the flaming thing, both men and women have done it to me. Men do it for reasons of ??? and then some women do it to others so they won't get flamed too. I'm not even a woman, just a guy with a girly voice and people just lay into me. It's why I never got into the competitive scene of any game. It's hell, and for more reasons than just that. Hopefully it doesn't stay like that forever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>North Central West Virginia! Where mental health treatment in general is a joke as is, and I'm taken even less seriously because I'm smaller than most of the people I meet but not small enough to meet any of the typical "oh shit, this is actually serious" criteria when I do reach out. The idea of what's "normal size" here is so skewed, it's really sad. Everything here is sad, really. Moved here from the Saint Louis area, where treatment and support is more accessible and there were people like me. It's really alienating out here. If I want help I need to leave this town.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like a guy I dated once. Watching him "work" was horrifying. He'd lie about everything. He lied his way into relationships, conned his way into jobs, fudged the tiniest details to "test" people sometimes. I've seen him lie about his age by only a year or two even though he wasn't young enough to have anything to gain from it. Everything was a game to be won. He bragged often about how manipulative he was sometimes. Not an ounce of self awareness or a soul in sight. Glad to be out of there. But I wound up with an uncanny bullshit radar because of it.</TEXT>

I call out incorrect nutrition/exercise facts that I hear and depending on who says it I might even get mean (like, "no idiot! You can't 'zone target' fat! What kind of commercial are you!" for example). You can't watch TV with me around without me inevitably raging out at a weight loss product's commercial, I don't drink liquid calories and will get upset if I'm at a place that doesn't have any of that, it sucks. I promise I'm a pleasant person to be around, but lack of nutrients make stupidity hard to take.</TEXT>

Apparently it was just a display model that was kept behind a case. He wrapped it up and shipped it as if it were his own firstborn child and added a charging dock, charger, and bag of Japanese green tea just out of the kindness of his heart. Every time I've ever ordered secondhand from Japan has been that good of an experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For years I couldn't place exactly what was wrong. Every time I tried to push the whole "presenting female" thing on myself I felt grotesquely uncomfortable in the most visceral possible way, like I was wearing a soaking wet wool shirt with a single armhole and rubber jeans that were several sizes too small in one leg and several sizes too big in the other. I chalked that up to being ugly. I knew that wasn't true. I dated well and often, got jobs without a problem, didn't get weird stares in public. While I was never exactly conventionally attractive, I knew I wasn't as ugly as the feeling of grief and confusion I felt when I looked in the mirror would let me believe. Sure enough, immediately after my first haircut as a trans man I was able to see myself and feel comfortable for the first time ever. My body felt less like a rental car and more like I owned it. It's really something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. People kind of just exist, much the same as buildings or the sky or some grass in my mind. I don't look people in the face and will probably not recognize you at all until you become a recurring figure. I really do work on that but people just don't register for whatever reason. But then I talk to them more. Inevitably I wind up in their house, or them in mine. We eat some meals together, we talk about life, we learn more about each other. At some point there's just a snap, like you lock into place inside my skull and you become a permanent fixture that I'll know like the back of my hand. There's not a lot of in-between.</TEXT>

Stuff was on paper, verbal tests, reaction time tests on a computer, it was so much that I struggled to even finish. I don't know if that's the norm, but to say that you know more than a licensed professional with years of education, especially with conditions where lack of self awareness is so common is beyond gross. I get a lot of professionals kinda just squeaked by and it's a wonder they're in practice, but there's no way a kid reading stuff off of Tumblr or some Wordpress blog is going to know it all. Ugh. It's okay to look it up to get an idea, but please ask a doctor after.</TEXT>

Go to a private room where you won't be an asshole and an annoyance. Not to mention that if you don't want to squidparty or don't realize they're doing it and kill someone on accident you'll be hunted down specifically. That's not fun. That's toxic in every game, I don't make exceptions just because this one's brightly colored and has cute characters. Fuck that and fuck people who do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't as much, but my best friend has autism and he's like that with me. We met back in the summer school after the sixth grade, and hit it off immediately. He's always been really clingy and protective. He even lets me call him his special nickname that only his mom was allowed to use. He gets upset when we have plans to talk on the phone if they're cancelled and he talks about me a lot when I'm not around. We tried exploring whether or not that was a crush or something, but it turns out it's not like that and we're better off friends. He just really, really likes me. He's just overall a wonderful friend. When I was with my abusive ex he begged me to let him pack my stuff into his truck and to take me back to my hometown. He was there when no one else was. I've always wondered what the obsession was, but if it's an autism thing I completely understand. I've only gotten like that with fictional characters but I'm sure the feeling is similar. Sorry for the wall of text.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Literally me. Trying to find things to do to help you forget, you can't seem to get it out of your head no matter what you do. You just sit there and bargain with yourself for hours. "Do I eat now? If I eat now, I can make these thoughts stop." "No, I can't eat now. I'll break my fast and then it won't be a whole day without eating". "Make a salad, calories are so little if you use vinegar as a dressing and we just won't count it." "That'll make me even hungrier and you know it." "Not if you eat enough lettuce, you can fill yourself up on that and burn it off on a single walk." "Ugh, fine." *eats a salad, triggers a binge, cries self to sleep* *tells self that'll be the last time, but the cycle continues the next day*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do that! I try to stop because it really does keep me awake, but the need to move around is so intense. I liken it to the feeling of pain, like the really bad discomfort and feeling of urgency without the actual pain. Does that make any sense? My legs go nuts for example. I get this compulsion, I have to clench and unclench the muscles in them, or wiggle my toes without stopping or the discomfort will become unbearable. Can only seem to sleep when exhausted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do. I'm not even that "sensitive" either, but it seems like I get verbally cracked upside the head for showing the slightest amount of vulnerability. I actually tend to be overly analytical, carefully examining peoples' motives and catching dishonest people and behavior long before those around me do. Though my hunches have almost always been correct and he acknowledges it every time, my stepdad is always looking for vulnerabilities to belittle and step on. I'm polite and easy to get along with, but I'm easy to trigger if you come at me sideways. People do it on purpose. I'm bothered by people yelling, loud noises, people bringing up subjects they know are sensitive over and over again, rubbing that raw spot until I explode and they can make fun of me all over again. I'll tell my stepdad, "hey please stop comparing me to my mom every time I make a minor mistake. She was abusive and neglectful and I've dedicated my whole life to rising above that. I know you think it's funny but it actually really hurts. Please stop." And he'll be like, "wow. You're bitchy today. Just like your mother." People make fun of my interests and hobbies, make fun of me when I express love or excitement about something, make fun of me when I'm ill and step on every positive emotion I express. So I'm stuffed into this bitter hole where I isolate, and then get made fun of for being "hateful" or "lazy". It's like people think that deeply ingrained trauma can just go away by simply saying, "That's the past! Bye bye past! My brain is completely normal now!" God, it's the worst! That's the thing though. You can't win with people like that. In my case, and probably yours too they're lacking something pretty major. Usually that's perspective, sometimes empathy, morals, whatever that is it isn't your fault. Staying soft and kind in a world like this is really beautiful and it would do others a lot of good to respect people who don't turn to hate. Unfortunately it makes you vulnerable though.</TEXT>

So often has a misplaced word, stiff body language, or not making the socially appropriate amount of eye contact been read as me being rude, uncaring or hateful and it's nice when there's someone there who just "gets it", and doesn't assume the worst of someone who has to manually develop these social skills that others take for granted.

    <TEXT>It means admitting her feelings and flaws. My mom would rather die than confront that discomfort. Instead, she, consciously or not, pushes her problems onto others ("I don't need help, YOU DO!"/"I'm miserable and it's your fault!" etc.) She's essentially a big, open wound from her own upbringing and any amount of discomfort is unbearable. She's had others bear every burden for almost 60 years. She doesn't seem to think there's a single thing wrong with her and it's not changing any time soon sadly. She hides behind rage and denial.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't believe I've had to debate people over the fact that neglect is abuse too. The neglect I suffered was the reason CPS took my sister and I at 10 and 7, and yet I've been told that it's not abuse unless you're being beaten upside the head with a shovel every day or getting molested. I had to relearn how to eat because I could not keep a bite down once I was in care, and I still struggle with food to this day. And that's just a piece of what it's done. Emotional abuse is another oft forgotten one I'm glad you brought up. My partner's mom is like that, using and abusing, telling him he killed his twin in the womb and celebrating the (nonexistent, he had no twin) sibling's birthday on his instead, accusing him of giving her strokes when it's her drug use doing it, pushing his dad's death onto his shoulders, it's fucked up that he's been told he's not been abused either and he's had the physical abuse too. He just wasn't listened to. It makes me so mad to see people standing up for abusers. You can abuse without your hands. It does a lot of damage. My boyfriend and I are really fucked up people, and while we're both healing we shouldn't have had to do that. We should have been safe. What interest does some have in protecting abusers? Does it bring their own abusive nature to light? Does it make them confront their own less than stellar upbringing? I don't understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They could be brand new and practicing, or they could be gods who can snipe you in midair from across the map. I don't want to stick around and find out. In Turf War, I won't hunt you down but in Ranked I'm not going to just let them get in my team's way. Squidbagging them is completely uncalled for and if you do it to me while I'm using a charger I'll pick on you specifically. I used to hate on them until I got so fed up that I picked it up myself. After a few dozen hours, I know their strengths and weaknesses and aren't as bugged by em anymore. I think others should do the same. It's not easy to be really good at it. There are much more threatening opponents and people should focus on those.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My texture issues aren't really related to an ED, just autism but man the textures of some foods are so bad that eating them makes me extremely upset. I wouldn't eat celery, bologna, Jell-O, or radishes if they were the last foods on earth. I won't eat so many common foods but I don't think I'd call myself picky idk. Eggs need to be cooked a specific way (scrambled or omelette), I won't go near turkey or chicken unless it's really moist or has a sauce of some sort, ditto for bread. Most types of icing are too gritty, peanut butter gums up my mouth. Actually, come to think of it maybe I do have a lot of texture issues. Guess I'd never considered it.</TEXT>

My dad's side came over from Germany in the 1800's and they settled in a tiny little town in Gasconade County, Missouri. It was pretty secluded, few came in or out and as a result the German language continued for a very long time. It blows my mind that in modern day America, this is a thing.</TEXT>

I dabble in Ballpoint Splatling, 4K, Aerospray PG, or JR, and will occasionally use the Carbon Roller but that's just for the sake of learning.

    <TEXT>I get really bad about food. I refuse to let it go to waste. I'll eat it even if I'm not hungry or it's a little too old to be eating. I get attached and emotional towards my games consoles/handhelds too. I take really good care of them and get really distraught if I see a new scratch or I have to pack them away. Guess I've never made the connection but it does make sense. I'm very particular about my possessions and will notice very quickly if something is moved. Throwing away anything that isn't blatantly trash (though I get attached to packaging sometimes too) fills me with so much guilt. I don't want it to be "lonely", as silly as that probably sounds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 21st birthday was spent alone, doing chores. He gave me a cold soft taco from Taco Bell, leftover from his lunch, as a gift. Then he shooed me out of the bedroom to watch porn and get on MeetMe, followed by him getting on Discord voice chat and screaming all night. For a lot of people (including him) it's a milestone. For me he used it to remind me of my place. My 23rd really showed the contrast. I'm with a guy who generally treats me really well. We went out to eat at my favorite local restaurant, he showered me in love and really thoughtful gifts, him and my stepdad teamed up and got my favorite cakes (one cheesecake, one red velvet with cream cheese). He told me all day how special I was to him. Everything my ex did, my boyfriend did the opposite of and it really makes me think about just how bad he was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After I left my ex, I spent the following weeks in this absolute fog. I struggled to form sentences, struggled to stand for very long, none of the things I said or did made sense. A good friend of mine (someone who fought with my ex narc before and knew how he treated me) began to worry. He took me on his errands with him, took me to lunch, tried to make sure I wasn't alone. He'd have to guide me around and talk about very simple topics. Otherwise I'd just stare at a wall. That went on for a few weeks, but the random panic attacks went on for months. Dude's totally gone now and I feel way better. It gets better the further you get from his gaslighting, crazymaking behavior. He changed the way your world looked and this is the first time you've been out of the bubble in a very long time. Think of it like walking outside of a dark room into the light, how your eyes need to adjust. Try to be gentle to yourself, this is sadly pretty normal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of people think I have a child's brain, that if I choose to "grow up" I'll be able to do my chores the second they come up, to understand verbal directions the first time, that it's a choice that comes from not caring. They get really mad at the fact that I can't watch movies without also doing something with my hands at the same time. Just like any other invisible condition, it's hard for some to truly process it without experiencing it for themselves. It was also really heavily diagnosed a decade ago. It creates an effect, like "this means everyone has it! That means it's not real!" I see it with autism in recent years too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"You're crazy" "You need me" Mine claimed someone he definitely had consensual sex (I read the messages, I'm not stupid and he cheated in some fashion at least once a day) with raped him but when I was actually sexually assaulted by our roommate told people it was consensual and used it as a very public weapon. He told everyone. Told me he'd stop cheating if I started "actually caring" about my appearance. Manipulated me into beginning to look like "his type". Told me, "actually never mind. You aren't meant to be attractive. It's not your fault you're ugly." Kept cheating, said it was because I put no effort into my appearance. So beyond glad he's gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tested at an IQ of only 82. I struggle to learn new information, can't process what people are saying most of the time, am absurdly prone to mental overload. Every game I play takes me triple the amount of time it takes most people, I rarely remember my surroundings and have no sense of direction. It's like I'm in a fog nonstop. I'm really self aware and speak well, which I think makes my low intelligence all the more painful. They noticed the huge divide between my language skills and everything else they tested for, said it was really unusual but just said "whatever" about it. I really wish I was smart like so many other high functioning people I know. I wish I knew computers, cars, something of use. Nothing sticks. It feels really alienating and people are so mean about it.</TEXT>

The feeling of being sick and weak is unfortunately really satisfying, like waking up hungover with aching muscles from the party the night before or bandaging up my wounds. I binge as a form of self harm too. It's fucked up, and so many others love the self destructive nature of it all too. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes I restrict flawlessly, with no interest in food at all. Usually, a family member or a friend or an event or something forces food into me and it becomes an unstoppable series of binges. When I try to slow them down my brain gets pissed off and ravenous. Then one day, probably after a particularly bad binge I'll be right back to hating food. All this means is that I've been gaining and losing the same 25 lbs for the past decade, leaving a bag of loose skin and stretch marks behind. I hate it here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm the first in my immediate family (I suspect my aunt on the paternal adoptive side is orthorexic but it hasn't reflected on me any) to have one outright and on paper, but the behaviors are ingrained. Spent half of my childhood with a neglectful, narcissistic biological mom who took absolutely zero basic care of herself including hygiene and her eating habits are even worse. Every day she'd talk herself down, talk about how awful her body is, she'd tell me all the time that I was gonna grow up to look exactly like her. She'd tell me I was gonna have a big gut and that there was nothing I could do about it. She'd call me into her bedroom while she was naked to tell me this by the way. She'd buy every pill, supplement, MLM out there and do it for a day or two. As a kid I was the grown up of the house and sometimes felt tempted to do these programs just to show that I was an even bigger adult. After all, I see them on TV so all adults do them, right? I realize now that this isn't normal at all. I was adopted at 13 and food became almost too plentiful. My new family ate classic lower middle class Midwestern food, and they ate a lot of it. I was heavily medicated, loved competing with my dad and brother to see who could eat more. I ate a whole White Castle Crave Case at 13 one time. Meanwhile, my adoptive mom fit into my hand me downs from when I was 10-13, she looked like an absolute knockout in everything she wore, and her portions were child sized if they were there at all. She's active and loves hiking too, and when you hug her you fear crushing her. People think she's my younger sister. Virtually no stretch marks. Can you tell I'm jealous? Anyway. My childhood was messed up, man. So many things dumped wood onto the fire that eventually became my illness. I think this is why I was susceptible. Size created a dichotomy of good and evil between sizes (and mothers) in which being thinner meant I was smarter, more attractive, more memorable, more capable, with the ex boyfriend who put the final block in the hole that being extremely skinny was the only thing that was going to make people stop abusing me (i.e. cheating) as well that set this whole mess into motion. I'm so sorry for the long comment. Digging into family always makes me think.</TEXT>

Made it hard to reach out for help because everything I tried to say was brushed off as "an emo kid having a phase" and "you don't have to do that stuff to fit in". It brought eating disorders and self harm into the public eye and pop culture and to this day I still see damage in peoples' perceptions of these illnesses (though it's great we're finally having a conversation about them). I think this current stuff is really similar. This time it's autism and DID. Just about fitting in and feeling loved. I'm frustrated but I guess I get it. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my case, it was diastasis recti that made me look bigger than I used to. My abdominal muscles are pretty seperated and because of that I look really saggy there (not to mention loose skin and overall warping). I know how terrifying the changes can be and how much you can hate yourself... it's really hard. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Woke up in the dead of the night last night, drew this on my phone, and passed out again. The photo in the background was from a particularly reflective walk I had the day before. Life has been really weird lately. I'm going through the kind of shit that makes you question who you really are as a person. It's all gonna be okay though. I'll pull through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, that's disgusting. Literally, "join my downline or you're a bad parent and your kids will hate you when they get older". The anxieties of being a parent, asking yourself all the time whether or not you're doing a good job and they just dig right into it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He uses so much oil, butter, mayo, cheese. I'm in danger. Real talk though, he made some of the best burgers I've ever had. Cooked em in some jalapeno juice, fried some jalapenos on top. Toasted the bun in butter. If recovery means eating this stuff, it might not be that bad after all.</TEXT>
