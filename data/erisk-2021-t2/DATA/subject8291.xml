    <TEXT>I used to cut the tops of my arms as I'm always wearing band shirts no-one ever noticed. Now I have tattoos covering the scars, recently I did my lower arms, it's winter so I've just worn long sleeves or hoodies. Most recent was on my legs - hide with socks, But I went abit mad and have a lot more than normal to now try and hide. x\_x i'm now 32, I've hidden mine for years. no-one knows apart from the therapist I recently started seeing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, you just described me, I didn't realise there was a word for feeling being in that kind of state. I don't have the motivation either, I've packed in nearly all of my hobbies, I don't want to go out anywhere or see/talk to anyone (except my therapist) I just want the thoughts and feelings of numbness and harming to stop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am feeling exactly the same. Only 1 of my friends know I harm and was so disappointed, a couple of other friends think i'm just having a 'low patch' apart from that it's just me and my psychologist. I know my family and close friends would be devastated, but I don't want to live like this anymore. Had it far to long and I believe it's contributed to my physical problems now. I have no motivation to do anything, everything feels like a chore. And I feel numb and have my brain screaming at me to harm. Sick of it all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do. Not on meds for either as I am on so many for other things, I dont want anymore. They just add more side effects. I use fidget tools like a tangle, spinner and cube. You can get them on amazon. I also do Yoga and QiGong to help calm me and stop me thinking about things. I'm also seeing a psychologist, who has been helping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I am Titan, but I'd assume it will be the same for all classes. Select the required subclass. Have your melee box charged (middle box under supercharge bar) and punch when it is fully charged. That should give you 1 kill. You have to wait till it is fully charged again for it count for another kill. Hope that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope I can offer some help here.I feel the same. I see (currently phone appointments) a psychologist every 2 weeks. I've said from day one I am so bored, nothing interests me anymore. 2 psychologists have told me that not boredom but low mood. I have M.E and Fibro so often feel like drugs/speed might help.. But ultimately I know it won't you'll just get addicted. Believe me, I know. I go through phases at the moment. I've got so much going on at home/work that currently has my full attention. On my days off I am abit stuck. I have always been a big gamer. Final Fantasy 14 (like someone else suggested is great, I also play Destiny 2, and have just bought a VR. Find a game like FF14 that has a lot to do, you can fight, gather, craft. (19 fight classes and 12 gather/crafters to level 80) It also has on going patches and expansions. I try to get into a good book series (currently Skullduggery Pleasant) I used to play intruments but now have no interest in that, so just listen to spotify or collect vinyls (usually metal) I watch ALOT of tv/films, Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube. And finally try a new hobby, I've always been interested in aviation/history so I started making scale models (airfix, revell, Tamiya etc) however I've also lost interest in it atm . :/ I also come on to here when I feel rubbish, posting makes me feel abit better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've attempted twice many years ago, through pills. Recently I've had thoughts again, but what pulled me out of it was the thought of my stepdad, who would care for him, he would have to go into a care home and he wouldn't last long there. I felt like I would have killed him myself if I took my own life. I'm glad you survived it, and you found a purpose in your family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone else feel like they're life is all for nothing? I'm 32 years old. And I feel like my life is pointless. Been thinking the last few days, when I was in school I wanted to play Football, and play in rock bands. I did play in local bands, football never happened. Then around 20 years old I started to get sick. I now have Scoliosis, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ,Fibromyalgia, Depresssion , and countless side effects to all the medications i'm on. I work part time caring for my stepdad who has an acquired brain injury. But beyond that, I am nothing. I have no life thanks to chronic illness, friends don't understand or don't care, my mother who is my world has just been diagnosed with extensive bone cancer (secondary) Beyond my mum and my stepdad, I have no-one. I keep thinking I don't want to be here when they go, I might just join them, because what is the point in living like this? It's not living, It's only existing.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-12 09:59:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So a few weeks ago I was discharged from the Well Being service here, with an email stating that they can't help me. I then registered with the Sue Lambert Trust but the waiting list is up to 2 years long!! I have just finished a video call with the head of the Pain Psychology department in the Pain Clinic as they have said they have done all the can (mindfulness techniques, retraining brain to deal with pain etc) She suggested I contact the SLT in mean time and ask to see if I can talk to someone if in crisis... Not sure what that actually means because even though I often have thoughts about suicide I would never act on them again. Is harming crisis??I dunno. (I'm 3 months clean today) Also to contact doctor. My doc surgery always want to know the specific nature of the appointment but I don't want to tell them. Pain clinic also said docs will give me meds but I don't want to go on anymore :( Anyway, looks like I'm on my own again for now, unless I can find a psychologist in the next few months, but with lockdown most places have a massive waiting list. So looks like I've just got Reddit for now.</TEXT>
