    <TEXT>So I #8217;ve only been dipping for about 2 months and I #8217;ve tried everything. Straight, WG, LC, but so far my EDD has been Copenhagen Mint, I like the sweetness, and then I saw this bastard in my local 7-11. After a long 14 hour shift on my feet all day this is just what I needed. Can #8217;t say I #8217;ll completely drop the mint, but for now, I #8217;ll keep a log of this handy. Pack on boys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So are we officially at the end of original games? It seems like nothing original ever comes out anymore. Last thing that came out that had any originality was No Man #8217;s Sky but it was so terrible on launch it was basically forgotten. So my question is are we just doomed for a never ending cycle of sequels and flankers to proven games until everyone is burnt out? Is there ANYTHING original at all in development anyone knows about? It just seems like games have become like YouTube, one dev team creates a game that goes viral and now there are 3000 copies of the same thing with a new paint job. Idk little bit of a rant, just curious if anyone else has thought about this.</TEXT>

My instincts are telling me to get it out of this ziploc bag, but atm I have no other solutions...any help would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thinking about aging.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-05 01:07:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;ve  #8220;aged #8221; cigars in my NewAir unintentionally by just having a lot and they sit before I get to them, but, I smoked a Undercrown(Maduro) last night, and it was probably a mix of the weather and the alcohol in my system, but it was like a religious experience. So, as per the protocol, Today I ordered a box. And I have about 6 singles sitting in my singles tray I can smoke when I get the  #8216;Undercrown Itch #8217;. So this is the first box purchase I #8217;ve ever made with the sole intent of aging. Maybe I jumped the gun, as I have heard mixed reviews on aging Undercrowns, but it seemed like a good idea to me. Plan is to just put a date sticker on the box when I receive them, stick them in the back of the humidor and forget about them for 18months-2years. Was thinking of leaving the shrink wrap on the box. Are their pros or cons to this? Sorry for the long post. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Tl;dr - Thoughts on Aging Undercrown and Leaving Shrink on the unopened box to do so...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just get a cheap hygrometer, if you have one already, just try to put it in a cool, dry place in your house and leave it be, the worst thing you can do is open it every few hours to check on it. Get it as close to where you want it to be and leave it alone. Trust me, I know it #8217;s hard and I am INCREDIBLY anal about keeping mine exact temp and exact humidity. It will drive you nuts if you let it. A degree or a percentage one way or the other won #8217;t have a huge impact. Just stay disciplined and keep that humidor closed unless you #8217;re taking something out. DM me if you want to discuss further details, like what humidor you have and how you can get it into the optimal range.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So let #8217;s follow data models. Florida who has been open for over a month while cases have gone up, hospitalizations have decreased by 54% and Ventilator deployment is down 42% and cases are only on the rise because testing is way up. Or the multiple state penitentiaries where 92-95% of the population was infected and 98% of those infected were asymptomatic. And prison isn #8217;t known for their stellar health care. Not to mention NOW they #8217;re saying that asymptomatic transmission is SUPER rare. I #8217;m not saying Corona isn #8217;t something to be wary of, but constantly living in a state of fear is way worse for your health than catching this virus, according to the data models...Hospitals OPENLY ADMITTED to over reporting corona virus deaths because they received federal funding for each death related to the virus. So the numbers we have are almost certainly not accurate. I would cite my sources...but they #8217;re not hard to find at all if you have an IQ above 11. Medical professionals are wrong ALL the time. ie, Malpractice insurance. Not pretending to be moren knowledgeable than people with PhDs just saying...numbers don #8217;t lie bubba</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone else fame crashing? (MyTeam PS4)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-08 01:27:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>In MyTeam, I can #8217;t change my sponsors because whenever I try to click over  #8220;Financial History #8221; in the Corporate tab, the game crashes. Can #8217;t seem to get past it and my car is looking drab as hell, I have 4 sponsors but the only one included in the livery is the title sponsor. It #8217;s a bit frustrating. Hopefully will be fixed in day 1 patch. Anyone else having this issue?</TEXT>
