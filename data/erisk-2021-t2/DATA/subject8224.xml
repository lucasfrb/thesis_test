    <TITLE>I #8217;m pregnant  amp; scared</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 11:48:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I turned 18 on the 2nd. My boyfriend is stil 17 til October. I found out I was pregnant the 29th of May. All our parents  amp; him want me to have an abortion. I live with mine and don #8217;t have a job. My parents say I can stay for 6 months but they refuse to help with the baby. And I have to be completely out by November. His parents are calling and texting everyday to push me into abortion. I want my baby. I #8217;ve never really thought about pro life or pro choice. My parents are big in our church but have forbidden me from mentioning the pregnancy. I #8217;m not as religious as they are. But everyone is pushing me and I #8217;m so scared. Can I do this? I got signed up for ebt  amp; medicaid. I have to send in a few forms but that #8217;s it. I called and I #8217;ll go get my wic card In a few hours. I #8217;m filling out the paperwork for low income housing right now. Update at 5:30pm There #8217;s so many comments I #8217;m having trouble replying to everyone. I just want to thank you all so much for the support. I #8217;m not terminating the pregnancy. I #8217;ve got a good start on getting us out of my parents house. If my bf doesn #8217;t want to be with us when he turns 18 that #8217;s his choice. I really want to raise this baby.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. I never thought they #8217;d do this. They have talked about being pro life my whole life. They did offer to pay for me and my boyfriend to get married but he won #8217;t so this was the next choice for them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much. I #8217;m scared the baby #8217;s grandparents will try to get custody. They keep saying I can #8217;t provide for it and it would be better off elsewhere if I don #8217;t abort. I #8217;ve got to get a job so I can get the things the baby will need so I can show that I #8217;m trying. I #8217;m going to appy today for food and insurance help</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh I #8217;m not romanticizing anything. The baby #8217;s father does not want to be with us. He told me last night that even if I had the abortion this has been too stressful for him. We broke up completely. I #8217;ve been a care taker for my siblings since they were all born. I know how hard  amp; tiring babies are. But I created this baby  amp; im willing to take on the responsibility of raising it. I have written out a pro/con list actually and for me, there #8217;s more cons to abortion then pros.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update on my post</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-27 00:56:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there everyone. I made a post a couple weeks ago and you all were so kind! I want to thank all of you that replied and sent messages. A few went above and beyond with your kindness. So I #8217;m about 11 weeks. I #8217;m moving in with my aunt in the next little bit. She #8217;s single with a 5 year old and I #8217;ve babysit him since he was born. We get along great and she #8217;s helping me get a job. My parents are in total denial about everything. The pregnancy, me moving, me not helping them any longer. My ex boyfriend has a new girlfriend and they both act like nothing is going on and that I #8217;m a villain in their story. His parents sent one last text to say they hope I give up the baby and that their son #8217;s future is more important to them than anything. I don #8217;t want anything from those people. I #8217;m exhausted and tbh I #8217;ve been really depressed. But it #8217;s starting to get better. Again I want to thank you all for all the help and advice. It has made me feel so much better.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What #8217;s the best stroller for this situation?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-06 00:00:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all. Due with baby in January. I very rarely go walking outdoors. I have a lot of asthma  amp; the heat bothers me. Then the cold bothers me. The car the stroller would be in(which isn #8217;t mine so that might change at times depending on who we #8217;re with) is a Chevy equinox which has a decent amount of space in the trunk. I just don #8217;t know what stroller is best for pretty much just malls and maybe doctors. Do I need a big full size one or can I use the baby trend snap carrier? I keep going back  amp; forth on a travel system</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/h09b16/im_pregnant_scared/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf I found out I #8217;m having a boy!! We are both doing really well and healthy. I #8217;m still jobless but hopefully I can change that soon or after the baby. My parents and the baby #8217;s other side including his father want nothing to do with us at all. His father didn #8217;t even care to know the gender. I am having a bit of anxiety over everything  amp; making sure he has what he needs but I #8217;m happy with my choice  amp; keeping him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What kind of diapers do you all recommend? I #8217;m going to be using disposable. And only the regular in store brands. Huggies, luvs, pampers etc. I don #8217;t have the money for the ultra expensive. Ive gotten some huggies little snuggles so far. I was thinking of using luvs mostly. How many packs or boxes per size? Should I try to get just newborn and 1s til baby is here or should I try for some of each size? I #8217;m a very young first time mom and idk what I #8217;m doing mostly.</TEXT>
