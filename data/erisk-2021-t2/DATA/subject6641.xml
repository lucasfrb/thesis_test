    <TEXT>Whatever you need to do to distract yourself from the negative thoughts. Distraction is the key but it does take practice. As someone who has suffered with depression most of my adult life, I #8217;ve learnt to focus completely on a tv show or film or some other task so that my mind doesn #8217;t wonder. Or I sleep if I really need to get away from thoughts. Being with friends is the best answer or having a good in-depth chat with someone you have a connection with. I also try to help others, a) because I feel the need to and b) it helps to distract myself from my issues. Try to keep smiling as you #8217;re stunning and I hope you don #8217;t have many days where you doubt your worth. The world is better for you being in it x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>9/10 at least. You're not fat, you have curves which all gorgeous women have. Who wants to snuggle with a stick insect? ;) And the scars don't detract from your beautiful body. Rather they show how strong you are and that you've been through the mill but are still up and fighting. Be proud not of the scars but what they represent. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah ok, I didn't know that. Just feeling my way around this whole reddit thing and just seemed to be a lot of selling etc. Oh yes, I know people who are able to earn money through nudes are smart. As the saying goes, if you've got it, flaunt it. These days it's hard enough to earn good money so good luck to them. It's just not what I like. I'm learning every day lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally get what you mean. I don't have a huge amount of relationship experience or have women regularly wanting to date me lol But I have seen a lot from other people and been on a lot of first dates. I think everything in life is a compromise but it's about prioritising the things that you won't compromise on. And for me, attraction is one of the things that you can't force. Personally I want what my grandparents had. As much in love at the end as when they met. So I would identify the things that are deal breakers for you. The other stuff, give them a chance to see if they either meet your expectations or whether you can live with it. That's my thought for what it's worth. Hope you're staying safe over there in the Emerald Isle x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hi, thanks for your reply. I'm the same when it comes to ladies. I'm not really attracted to BBW's, in a sexual way at least, I'm always keen to be friends with anyone and I know some lovely ladies who I'm not physically attracted to, but I don't like skinny either. As you say, padding is nice for cuddling and I love cuddling, plus I like to make my girl feel protected so I guess that helps, but when it comes to sexual attraction, surely slim and toned beats dad bod no?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately you can #8217;t but then any time people look for love they run the risk of being hurt, not just with OLD but in general. It #8217;s lovely that you don #8217;t want to hurt anyone and are trying to answer all the messages but most of it is not in your control and that will be an impossible task so best to filter out the ones that interest you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can empathise with your position entirely. I think a Robbie Williams lyric sums up my and probably your situation. "I don't want to die, but I ain't keen on living either." One of the worst things I've had to do is admit this in front of my parents at interviews with professionals and Government representatives. But I think most people want to be alive but aren't necessarily aware that every day they make the choice to be alive. Whereas some people consciously make that choice rather than the alternative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again I can empathise with that. The trick is to try to control those thoughts as much as possible, take each day one at a time, try to get some pleasure out of even the smallest things, and leave the rest to fate. If we choose not to do the unthinkable then we really have no other choice.....other than to just survive as comfortably as possible. But you have exactly the right idea of how many people would be hurt or affected if you did. Not just those that know and love you, but the Paramedics who tend to you, the Police Officer who has to inform your family...they tell me that never gets easier. But I'm sure the world is a better place for you being in it and we are noble in enduring our suffering so that we don't pass it onto others. You should be proud of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't fret. You've got plenty of time to find "the one". I've seen some comments that the pandemic has actually made dating easier. People talk a lot online and find out quite quickly if they are not suited, and then have online dates. Not only does that mean you're more comfortable if and when you do meet, it saves time and expense going on lots of dates that don't work out. Got to admit they have a point lol. Try to chill at the moment, let's get through this and then worry about the future. One day at a time at the moment :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anybody else get tired of that advice whether it's for CFS or Depression? All the "solutions" to these two conditions (get out more, exercise, improve your diet, sleep well and have a routine, think positive etc etc) come under the heading of "if I could do that I wouldn't have a feckin problem would I?" With depression especially, they're basically saying I should use my broken brain to fix my brain. Ever get the urge to break the legs of people who say this sort of thing and tell them to run it off or is it just me? lol And of course the old "you're tired because you're depressed". Yeah there is a link but who's to say I'm not depressed because I'm tired? It takes energy to be happy. It takes energy to do all the things being suggested in order to cure my depression and tiredness. Sorry just had to vent. I know the people who say these things are well meaning but jeez...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a late starter and I'm certainly no expert but I think the only time I regretted having sex was the first time. It was a woman I was infatuated with, thought she liked me, she was a lot more experienced but when it came to the "event" she was not supportive, didn't put me at ease and consequently it didn't go well. Over the next few months it transpired that I was just "useful" to have around for her and she was only "fond" of me. So my regret was that my first time was with the wrong person. So my only advice would be that if you feel comfortable with this guy, and he sounds very supportive and respectful, you want him to be your first and your head is mostly in control, then the chances of you regretting it are slim, or at least reduced. Best of luck.</TEXT>

So I'd love to chat to any UK ladies and see where things go. I'm open to online chats, possible meet ups, friends online or in real life, even hookups or FWB if it comes to that. If hugs are involved that's a bonus. I won't go into detail about myself as that would not leave us much to talk about initially as we get to know each other. But I'm in the South East and for what it's worth this is me (appearance seems to be important online).

    <TEXT>If your boyfriend really thinks that and doesn't realise he's the luckiest guy in the world to have a girlfriend with an amazing body like yours, then I think he needs an eye test at the very least. You have a fabulous body, amazing breasts, wonderful tummy, perfect ass, voluptuous and so sexy. Your body is a lovely shape. I know it's hard when people we care about tell us negative things, but I think he's so wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. I don't think anyone should have to hear things like that from someone they love and in a relationship you should build each other up not the other way round. When I love I love everything about the person and I want to make them feel great. I would not want to be with someone who affects my self esteem no matter how much I might love them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh totally. I agree with that. It is a choice to be made if the OP really wants to stay with him and it's the age old thing of treading the fine line between love and it being harmful to yourself. Very difficult to do. Love is about loving the good and living with the bad but there are obviously limits and that is for the individual to try to decide. It's not easy but I wish her luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure if this counts but in the case of The Yorkshire Ripper the police ignored or did not connect some victims because they believed the killer was only targeting prostitutes. The chief investigating officer, George Oldfield, also became convinced that a tape recording sent to them (and also some letters) was from the killer despite many people pointing out that it couldn't have been. Because of this the Police only focused on men with the accent on the tape and discounted the actual killer, even though many officers had suspicions about him, because he didn't have the same accent as the man on the tape. One victim who survived even gave them a photofit of her attacker that was spot on and told them that the voice on the tape was not the man who attacked her but Oldfield was convinced that she was not a victim of the ripper because she wasn't a prostitute so her evidence wasn't taken seriously. Several women's lives could have been saved if Oldfield had not been so fixated on that tape which, of course, was a hoax.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Easy to be critical in hindsight and there were several factors working against the Police, not least being the sheer amount of information before the time of computers...so all on index cards. But the belief in the tape and letters certainly took the investigation away from the real killer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that several lines of enquiry were actually leading in his direction. My knowledge is gained from documentaries so not comprehensive and I may be wrong on some of this, but I believe that a  #163;5 note the killer had given to one victim had been tracked down to having been issued in a pay packet by two companies, one of which Sutcliffe worked for. Also they had manually tracked down and eliminated thousands of cars that could have left a tyre track at one of the crime scenes and that was leading towards Sutcliffe but I believe that inquiry was stopped after the tape was received as that was considered a better lead. He was definitely interviewed multiple times and I think his car had been logged in the vicinity of red light areas several times. Would it have enabled them to catch him sooner and save the lives of several women? Well I guess people have been arguing over that ever since. Like with a lot of crimes, catching him eventually came down to luck and the suspicions of the Police Sergeant who went back to the arrest site and found the weapons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes he didn't just kill them. He butchered them. In fact the killing was strangulation and throat cutting. Then he ripped them, disembowelled and in at least one case took an organ away with him. Mary Kelly was unrecognisable. He destroyed her. So many suspects ranging from the likely to the weird. Most people's favourite is Kosminski. However I saw a programme where someone said that they may have got him mixed up with another Polish "lunatic" who died in an asylum not long after the murders apparently stopped. I can't remember the details but in somebody's memoirs they had said the murderer was most likely a homicidal polish man who died in an asylum shortly after the murders but he never named the man. Now Kosminksi did die in an asylum but many many years after the murders. However there was a very violent and disturbed man who died in an asylum just after the murders so maybe it was him.</TEXT>
