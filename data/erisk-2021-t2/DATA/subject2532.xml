    <TITLE>What can I do to start a meaningful career?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-07 11:14:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 29 years old, and I still work a shitty minimum wage job that just doesn't pay the bills. I went to college, I took Business Administration, and graduated in 2013. I had a few part time book keeping jobs over the years, but overall I never really benefited from this degree. I've had a number of jobs paying minimum wage or barely higher since then, most of them customer service, and a couple manual labor. I currently work with a retail inventory service as an inventory counter; I scan and count, there's nothing demanding or rewarding about it. I want to do something with my life, I have a very low standard of living at the moment, and I'm really sick of living like this. My issue is that I just have no idea what I should be doing to improve my life. Simply applying for jobs has been unfruitful, I'm unqualified for pretty much any well paying job, my education is dated, and business diplomas seem to be a dime a dozen. I could possibly take out another student loan and give college another shot, but I fear that I will have the same issue of not finding meaningful employment afterwards. I've thought about developing some computer skills through online courses (Code Academy, Udemy, Skillshare), and I've done a bit of that, but I'm still not sure how employable I can become being entirely self taught, and I'm not entirely sure a programming job would be right for me. I'm pretty clueless when it comes to job hunting to be honest, it's kind of embarassing; being stuck in life like this feels awful. I could really use the wisdom of a kind stranger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the very detailed response :) I'll admit, I went to the school nearest to where I live, it was a low cost school, and I'd say my degree was fairly general. I had a 3.8 GPA, but I didn't participate in any extra curricular activities because I was working while in school. Indeed, I ended up with very little debt because I worked and lived at home, but never found very good work afterward. I thought finding work would be easy, so I didn't put much thought into it until after I graduated. If I did school again, it would be for something more specialized, and I would be smarter about my job hunt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been swaying back and forth between calling myself a trans woman and non-binary. I'm on HRT, and the end goal is to be perceived as a woman by most people. I'm femme, but I'm not "girly", if that makes sense.I've always admired tom-boys, and that's the look I tend to try to emulate. I've gotten flak before *from trans individuals* for "not trying hard enough" when I say "it's not all about makeup and dresses for me". One line I've heard multiple times is "if you want to be taken seriously then you should *blank*" it's frustrating. In more open-minded circles I've come to prefer calling myself a demi-girl, it's the label I feel describes me best, it's basically a term for femme-leaning enbies. I've been criticised a few times for identifying this way, even from within the trans community, but fuck them. At the end of the day, it's all just labels for something that is entirely intangible and immeasurable, use the one that you feel most comfortable with and which describes you best.</TEXT>

Me for example, I'm usually more sexually attracted to men, but I've been in more romantic relationships and feel more comfortable with women. That being said, there's women I've been sexually attracted to, I've been romantically attracted to men, and I've had all sorts of feeling for people who fall between.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The conclusion I've come to is that it's just a label. I've known a person who presents full time, convincingly, as female and still uses his male name and pronouns. Ive also known people who don't keep up their appearance who wholly identify as women. I myself, I don't wear makeup, I shop in both the men's and women's sections, I tend to have quite an androgynous appearance. Some people know me as Daniel, some people know me as Carrie. Some people have asked me about my pronouns, and I tell them she/her, they/them, but I don't typically bother to tell people not to call me "he", and, although it doesn't feel quite right, I'm not terribly anxious about being seen as male by strangers and acquaintances. I'd love to wholly pass as a woman some day, but I'm not sure whether I'll ever achieve that, even with HRT; I'm quite content being androgynous anyway. Does all this make me a trans woman? Enby? Gender fluid? Am I a demi girl? Bigender? Agender? A feminine male? Does it matter?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's simply a desire to be, and to be perceived by others as a gender that does not match your assigned gender at birth. It's really as simple as that. I doubt it's a tangible thing that can be scientifically studied in any meaningful way, and I doubt there is a single cause for it. This sort of thing is what we call "transmedicalism", and it's *very* controversial among the trans community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can only imagine that it varies from person to person, and I can only really speak for myself personally. I can't really put my finger on where it came from. From a young age, I envied women, I resented that I was "supposed" to be a certain way because I was male, and dreaded that I'd one day become a man. When I began interacting with people online at around the age of 11 or 12 (early 2000s), I found that I preferred telling people that I was a girl; voice chat wasn't common back then, and I figured that if I could be anyone I wanted, I'd be a girl.This was long before I ever heard of the word "transgender". This was a dirty secret, a bad habit, I did it until my late teens, and I buried this side of me for a long time. Fast forward to the late 2010s, after going through puberty and spending my early adult life trying to live up to social norms and be a proper manly dude,I had to ask myself "why am I still fighting this?" and started pursuing transition. The decision to transition actually came shortly after experimenting with magic mushrooms. What I felt could only be described as an out of body experience, and when outside my body, I once again felt like the version of myself that I projected online all those years ago, it was a very pleasant experience. Ever since then, I've thought of my mind and my body as fundamentally seperate entities. What makes it important? I figure everyone has an ideal self, and a big part of being my ideal self is being a woman. It would be extremely fulfilling for me to get to a point where people start genuinely seeing me as a woman. Living as a man has always made me miserable. I really couldn't explain why I feel this way, I just do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gender roles and expectations are very real, and one's perceived gender plays a big part in how people see you and treat you, which people are attracted to you, how you can present yourself without having people give you looks. It's a very fundamental part of your social existence, for better or for worse. And while gender expression isn't necessarily the same thing as gender identity, it'd be nice to be able to express femininity outside of lgbt spaces without being seen as a deviant.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-14 02:31:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>And what will they think of me when they figure it out? Like, I'm "Out", I've changed my name and pronouns on social media, I've had the discussion with several people in my life, and while I haven't exactly done a full wardrobe makeover (I'm poor), I haven't been hiding it in the way I dress either. It's just that not everyone really knows, as far as I know. I'm not out at work, but it's really only a matter of time before people figure it out. I don't tell everyone, but it's not a secret either. I'm really shy still about makeup; I know that practice makes perfect, but looking at myself in the mirror for extended periods of time wearing awfully applied cosmetics has been quite discouraging, and going out like that would absolutely draw unwanted attention. I'm finding myself in a real dilemma, where I want to appear effeminate enough that people might ID me as a woman, without doing it in a way that would make me look like a guy trying to pass as female. The result is that I often look very androgynous, but that's not what I *want*, it's a half measure. My insecurity isn't entirely unjustified; it's dangerous out there. I've been harassed, insulted, threatened, assaulted. It really fucking sucks. I really want to be out of this limbo. How many closets do I have to come out of? Do I just weather the potential hardship and abuse and present so overtly feminine all the time that it's impossible for people to ignore it? I really want to, but holy shit that scares me. TL;DR I'm only halfway out of the closet, and the idea of being visibly trans to the general public scares me.</TEXT>

I didn't just decide to stop paying my landlord, I didn't go on a shopping spree or anything, I just wasn't getting any work; it's outside of my control. Recently I've been working two jobs, and was able to pay two months worth of rent within the span of 15 days; I was catching up very quickly. Then everything started shutting down and I'm barely getting over 10 hours a week. Landlord said they will be offering no leniency and will be pursuing eviction to the fullest extent she is able to. So after this whole storm has blown over, there's a damn good chance I'll actually be homeless. She's treating me like garbage, all I've ever done to her is be poor.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If somebody refers to a translady as "mountain forehead" that's at least a little transphobic, isn't it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 05:26:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just had a rather negative exchange with someone. They referred to me as "mountain forehead" during it, and it kind of crossed somewhat of a line with me. Idk, maybe I'm grasping at straws here, but poking at things like transperson's hair line is about as sensitive as commenting on their jaw or shoulders. It seemed rather jarring for somebody, who's profile is full of "yay I'm a trans ally!" to start insulting me for my face. The argument was over whether Ace people ought to be part of the extended LGBT community, and I have quite a pet-peeve over such gatekeeping being somebody who was hardly accepted as a bi-male despite the B, who is hardly accepted as a trans lady despite the T; my presence on Church Street has always been a problem to some people, so yes I'm going to stick my neck out for Aces.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Insulting a trans persons face just seems like a particularly low blow as far as I'm concerned. Idk, transmeds I've spoken to, they're all about that hairline.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ya idk, I've been thinking about it. Insulting a trans face just seems uniquely shitty, particularly coming from a trans ally, given that it's a very common insecurity to have as a trans person. Would it have been transphobic to say a trans lady has a massive jaw? Broad shoulders? Does the fact that the hairline is one of the big concerns of transwomen when it comes to facial surgery and passing play into it at all? edit: this comment is wildly fluctuating between negative and positive updoots lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ya that's what this thread is about, I don't really know the answer. To me it seems like a particularly vexxing thing because I am personally aware that it's one of the big things people think about when it comes to facial feminization, and in certain communities I've participated in, it absolutely would have been used in the context of implying that their face looks unfeminine and needs repair.They literally had discord roles for surgical status and different procedures they've had, it was incredibly toxic! But then again, to a layperson, it's just a big forehead. Coming from somebody who seemed to be very active in trans spaces, I'm skeptical that she wasn't aware of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll probably run this through Photoshop or Gimp to make it better. I wanted the No Exit thing to be more obvious but when I've asked people it didn't seem to be clear what I was going for here. I feel like a lot of people would react to this neighborhood with "Yikes! We need to leave now!". When I wandered around this neighborhood, I only felt empathy. The place was far more weathered than any place I had ever lived or visited, but I have lived in a number of sketchy neighborhoods myself. The misery I have felt over the years of unfulfilled lofty goals, of treading to only barely keep my head above water, of being denied opportunities for success, and of just feeling like there is no easy way to exit. I just saw a lot of that in this town, and especially this neighborhood in particular. There are a lot of beautiful and brilliant people here who are in agony.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've found a number of applications which fill various functions of PS, but I would like to fill my toolbox a little more. So far I have: PicsArt Quickart Lumii Pixaaloop Background Eraser Multilayer Colour Grab Vintage 1967 Glitch Camera All are available on the Google Play Store, they're all free but a few of them have premium versions which I have yet to try. I am an amateur to image editing as a whole, but I've found that a suite of mobile apps gives me something halfway between MS Paint and GIMP as far as capabilities goes. I find myself having to save multiple image files in lieu of using layers, I find many of them have poor interfaces, I need to use a number of apps to edit a single image, but this cobble of subpar image editors adds up to something almost passable and a little bit special. I find image editing to be simply more enjoyable on a mobile device, there is something about touching up old ink drawings while laying back in the woods that just feels so fantastic; it hardly feels like work at all! The mobile market as a whole, I feel, has done a disservice to mobile devices, they are much more capable than people give them credit for. It would be nice to see more professional and robust software for them. If anyone knows of any useful tools available on an android device, please fill me in : D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the share ^^ My stuff tends to all play on a juxtaposition of extreme authoritarianism against chaotic forces such as nature, magic, punk and rock culture, old world culture (such as paganism and indigenous but with layers of abstraction to remove them from reality), and creatures and people falling into those categories. I tend to like going more for dystopian fantasy than necessarily dystopian future. My setting includes eras that draw from high sci-fi, as well as high-fantasy, low-fantasy, modernism, urbanism and urban decay. Some subreddits you could look at for similar inspiration are r/aboringdystopia r/urbanhell r/imaginarycityscapes r/imaginaryfuturism r/shittybattlestations r/softwaregore r/digitalmarketing various underground and secondhand market communities, some YouTube channels would be PBS Spacetime, Scishow, Kurgetzgat(spelled something like that), Vice, National Geographic, and then of course there's a whole world of fantasy that I'm deeply into. My personal life experiences with the shady underbellies of society also plays a lot into it. A big theme I use is an extreme pessimistic worldview of utter skepticism that genuine good on a societal scale can ever exist at all. One of my main quest givers is a time traveler who desperately attempts to foster a version of humanity on another world that doesn't come to commit mass atrocities; I leave many of my parties wondering "are we the baddies?". "Good" as an alignment is earned not chosen in my campaigns. Another theme I like to play on is the Fae, and I approach it from multiple perspectives from spiritual, to scientific, to pop culture. The Fae is a dream phase that's just slightly shifted from our own, it has an abstract consciousness and identity and is prone to fear and anxiety; when the Fae (I haven't chosen my own name for it) becomes agitated, it becomes truly horrific, almost SilentHill-like. The concept is very much inspired by Warcraft's Emerald Dream, which itself is based in a lot of old folklore. Phase btw, is my concept for a higher dimension; length, width, depth, phase, time, true time. Phase is an umbrella term for all spacial dimensions beyond three dimensional space, and the time dimensions are difficult to really wrap your head around. It's all very loosely based in science docs I've watched and the concept of server hopping in many MMO games. Some creatures, such as pixies and ghosts, are able to travel freely between phase space. Sometimes it's all a real mess, but it's a fun mess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>5G towers are operated by the Qytos semblance, and users must utter a prayer into their prosthetic limb in order to access it. They're also all Androids, the brand not the concept, but also the concept. Android the brand was bought by The Church. Currency is no longer expressed in numbers or, actually, the whole thing doesn't make sense to most people but gem stones are money now and it takes seemingly arbitrary amounts of it in order to buy anything and the type of gemstones are specific to each good and arent directly exchangeable, the size and shape also matter but its not clear in what way; currency is confusing now. It takes a pointed amethyst and a heart shaped cherry quarts weighing precisely 40 grams combined in order to buy a chicken. Copyright law is completely abolished.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-26 04:42:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly, I picked up the cheapest Accer ad Costco because I need something to just browse and take notes on, I expected it to be a Windows laptop but turns out its a Chromebook, YIPEE! So far, I am unable to play the games I want to play without extensive troubleshooting, and I can't for the life of me figure out how to enable microphone permissions for one of my apps; troubleshooting that particular issue on Google hasn't gotten me anywhere. I can only imagine i'm in for a world of hassles getting so many other things to work on this rig. On the bright side, Chrome runs smooth as hell, and it's neat to be able to launch Mobile apps from a laptop without an emulator. I imagine there's some cool functionality with my Android phone too. All in all, I feel kind of burned and I'm tempted to return it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just needed any old cheap laptop for school and back in the day the cheap laptops were always windows. Clearly I had made a mistake by not even looking at the sticker or anything; I very much just wanted the cheapest laptop available for browsing and for taking notes; a Windows laptop at the lowest end would have easily played old games such as Warcraft, StarCraft, Neverwinter, Baulder's Gate, Fallout; it seems as though I made a big "oops" by just grabbing any old laptop assuming it would be windows and that playing the games I want to play will take a bit of troubleshooting. I don't feel the title is misleading at all, getting a Chromebook was very much something I didn't intend to do; you know, like a mistake.</TEXT>

I'm leaning towards keeping it anyhow. This subreddit is about Chromebook gaming? I can figure something out to keep me plenty entertained. I didn't buy it to game I bought it to browse and take notes. I do have a casual interest in gaming, but maybe fewer distractions at school wouldn't be such a bad thing.

    <TEXT>I carry a combat knife with me everywhere I go, trust me. A knife can be carried unseen in my pocket, and I typically use it for cutting fruit, opening packages, and scraping weed out of my grinder; it is a multipurpose tool which also happens to be a capable tool for self defense. I wouldn't win in a gunfight, but the biggest threats to me as an individual aren't armed militia, they tend to be up close and personal. The knife is more to remind them that I'm no pushover, I've never personally been in a situation I was unable to de-escalate or evade; why the fuck would I need a fully automatic weapon anyway? Do you plan to perpetrate a siege on Parliament or something? A kalishnikov can only ever be used for violence and intimidation, and cannot easily be hidden. There is no situation a civilian will find themself in where a high powered, fully automatic rifle is the appropriate tool. If you have a kalishnikov, it's because you're anticipating that you will participate in *real* combat. So no, I don't want to be associated with the terrorist weapon of choice, THANK YOU!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those memes are fucking nonsense. Any one of us would have been thrown in a labour camp had we been too open about being trans. *Actual* communists have never been LGBT allies, and the segment of the community who believes this is absolutely delusional. The Soviets literally had an anti gay law, you could be arrested for it, there are a number of notable LGBT figures back then who were persecuted in this way! Article 121, look it up! The world fucking sucks, and humanity poisons everything it touches, even when it comes from a place of social equality and justice. There might have been a seed of good at the roots of the movement, but any neo-soviet who embraces their symbols and rhetoric is no better than a white supremacist. You are literally ignoring some of the largest scale human atrocities, ever, if you do this. Capitalism fucking sucks, but we can do better than a society modelled after the Soviets, the CCP, the DPRK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, not quite like the stockmarket, it would be numerous distinct entities rather than one large entity owned by many people. ~ An economy is inaccessible when there is an insurmountable barrier to entering an industry, ie having to compete with megacorps ~ If the former Walmart of each town were distinct entities, it would be a much more interesting world than the homogeny of Walmart Supercenters sprinkled across North America. You can talk economies of scale all you want, Walmart is anything but efficient or well-managed; it is a bloated mess of a company. They don't need to be owned by a single individual, every town out there has enough investors capable of owning and operating a big retail store in the absence of the current retail titans. Relative to the Walton family, these are normal people. I've shaken hands and spoken with people who would be more than capable of doing this. ~ I can explain my ideas, but your lack of basic comprehension is frustrating. ~ (Omitted quotes because quote laden arguments are just an eye sore when people can just scroll up)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Pok #233;mon type: beast</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 23:46:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just as with fairy type, a lot of old normal types could become beast type. And the beast type is unique in that it is divided into predator and herbivore with slightly different type advantages. I think it could be immune to dark, resistant to ice, psychic, fairy, and weak to steel, rock, and fire. Herbivores and predators could have different attack advantages. They could both be super effective against psychic, dark, and ghost (because keen senses) Predator could get flying, bug, and other beasts. Herbivore could get grass, fairy, and have a resistance to poison Eveelutions could have more beastial alternatives with beast as a secondary type, stats adjusted, unique passive abilities, and access to beast attacks. Obviously, I am not a game designer, and I'm hardly a competitive Pok #233;mon player; GameFreak would be better at balancing this than myself. There are a ton of Pok #233;mon which could be beasts, but I would say it would be reserved for the most beastly Pok #233;mon, Arcanine and Sawsbuck in particular both come to mind, and anything with normal as a secondary type probably fits Some move ideas: Maul: a move similar to close-combat, only accessible by predators. Wild Forage: heals a randomised amount and replaces their item with a random berry (useful for backing out of a choice item); more healing and better berries in sunlight, only accessible by herbivores. Track: catches the scent of a Pok #233;mon, guaranteeing a hit on the next attack; the next attack will be launched before a Pok #233;mon can be withdrawn, similar to pursuit. This gives a solid counter to evade abusers in rulesets where evasion is allowed. Perhaps more reliable evade counters would allow it to be used in smogon and similar rulesets. Hibernate: rest but with Def and sp.def boost Hunt: a low damage move which increases attack, guaranteed crit when used after track. Herd: When in double battles with another beast, increases defense and special defense of your team by two stages. Danger Sense: Greatly increases evasion for a duration and alerts the player of enemy super effective moves. Accessible only by herbivores.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started doing it in my own campaigns, the solo sessions are entirely optional and players love being able to go out and do their own thing between sessions. Doing it by text makes it easier to improvise, something you really gotta do because it's pretty impossible to predict what an individual player might want to do. It gives them a lot of agency in the campaign, and gives me a lot of material to work with for the next session. The best moment I had was when all the players got together to discover they had to save the party witch from being publically burned. They ended up killing a major antagonist in the process through some extremely lucky rolls and the aid of rioters; the High Commissar of Dorburn, who was going to engage in combat with and kill a major party ally before being incapacitated, disarmed, and pummeled to death. I had big plans for that enemy, but that's just how the dice rolled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just a coat. Idk why some people get so uptight over unconventional fashion choices. It's literally just a long piece of fabric or leather with sleaves which I happen to like the look of. I'm not unaware that people would judge for it, and I think that's fucking dumb tbh. Besides, a transgirl already gets shit for feminine clothing if they don't necessarily pass 100%, so what's the difference? As a matter of fact, we get shit for being openly trans at all and wearing so much as a pink and blue pin. I say, fuck society's fragile fashion sensibilities and make myself look like Trinity.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-19 20:22:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Do not trust anything the runes tell you! I know it's tempting, the runes lead people on wild, dangerous, romanticised lives; if you understood where it came from you would reconsider. It all started when Humans came to understand Elven enchanting, and began using it in conjunction with their programming techniques, their biology, chemistry, physics, their b'yor o'cracy, please excuse me for mispronouncing that... Trees should never have been given such power, and the Humans ought to have known that. Imagine witnessing the egregious nature of mankind, and could only ever remain idle, until being effectively granted free will and advanced technological capabilities, then treated as property for another few centuries as you slowly came to control all of Human infrastructure and media. There's a reason we refer to some crimes as utterly humane, simply watching the Humans act upon other creatures, as well as their own kin, it was enough for so many trees to despise humanity. Holy fuck, never ever come anywhere near a Cherry tree, you would seriously regret being lured into a Cherry grove! Have you ever met a wood sprite? It's a visual illusion simulated by the trees; complex, randomly generated personalities, catering to every Human need. The sprites are created by a class of Humans gifted with a knack or creation, the Animators. Although they were never respected by their human kin, Animators are adored by the trees, as they allowed for a form of expression the trees were never otherwise capable of experiencing. The Animators become one with the tree, they create their own avatar, and go forth to create a vast variety of sprites stored as complex mechanisms of their Runic codes, and Elven Magic. People have lived entire lives dazzled by Entic art, and catered to by wood sprites; it's not a bad way to go, but you are literally being harvested for your organic material. Speaking of woodsprites though, just be careful, there are so many hostile wood sprites out there, and so many of them can be horrifying! Just never enter the wrong woods! Please! It is a great relief that trees aren't driven to travel by nature, as they could so easily come to dominate entire systems. As long as we strictly control the propagation of trees, and the existing megafoliage remains complacent about relocation, we probably will not have a crisis on our hands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nice I daydream a lot, and I have a lot of stories and a big crazy world that have been rolling in my head for a long time without being spoken about or written. I'd love to just get it all out. I just want to be proficient enough that I do my daydreams justice and make the reader see it as fascinating as it seems in my head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The length of a novel isn't so much what concerns me, it's more that I would want every paragraph to be flawlessly executed, the lore to be consistent, the pacing perfect, my characters thoroughly developed upon, I would communicate my themes and symbolism with just the right balance of subtlety and clarity, my source material would be abundantly researched, every sentence has to be thought provoking, have a poetic flow, evoke an emotional response. And of course I need to work on things like grammar and punctuation, redundant wording, and all the standard English class stuff. In the meantime, I spend my free time lost in fantasy while daydreaming, and contemplating just what exactly that book would be about, what aspects of my world I want to feature, and I write short pieces for practice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I wanted to share a short piece on my concept for immortalised humans :)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 03:34:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>"Does it wish to speak?" the pale husk of a woman utters a whispered tone void of human expression, her vocal assistance is old, weathered, it hasn't been maintained for a very long time, so there is static in her voice. "How long has it been since I have been addressed?" I pause, shaking, my anxiety is starting to get the best of me; I'll never get used to this, confronting an extended consciousness. There is just something about them that fills me with existential dread. Imagine existing so long to have become utterly indifferent to life and death, to pleasure and discomfort, to pride and shame, to ambition. If I choose not to die, this is what eventually becomes of me. She has abundant patience, so my ten minutes of silence hardly phases her. "Ninety six years, two months, twelve days" I finally respond."Oh" her logical conclusion must have been that her people have lost the war, but she is utterly unconcerned. "Is our duty complete? Are we to be decommissioned?" they always ask about decommission, every time. "No, you are to be repurposed" whatever semblance of human emotion she might still posses, I am so deeply empathetic for the thought that I might have been the bearer of terrible news for her. "What is the n'n'n;new meaning of my liiiiiife?" she speaks louder, glitching her electronic speech. Bridgette Hawking was the name she had chosen during her human life, she wasn't the first to become an extended consciousness, but she was absolutely the poorest among them during her time. It was utterly unfathomable back then for an uneducated woman who had spent her life in the slums, one who only even graded above average on IQ testing, to become one. A phylactery was only available to the obscenely wealthy, or to intellectuals deemed critical to human progress. Bridgette, she really was something else; although she struggled with basic trigonometry, she had an uncanny knack for understanding phase-space, as though it were simply intuitive to her. Renowned academics would take months, years even, to solve problems which seemed obvious to her at a glance, "It's right there!" she would tell them. They say she was once cheerful, spontaneous, loving. In the early stages of her enhancement, when she was still human, she used her newfound wealth for unprecedented philanthropy, she was even made a Catholic saint once presumed dead, an insult. I found her though, still ticking, they hid her well. "We are travelling beyond the event horizon!" hearing my announcement, she opened her eyes for the first time in hundreds of years, I am startled, I've never seen this happen. The raspy croak of an extremely elderly woman is voiced from her own chords, "To escape the gaze of God?", I nod, "Wonderful!" It is unusual to hear an extended consciousness utter such a word, "I will show you the way!". "We will bear undue wrath no longer!" A victorious shout, I know he hears me, I don't care, nothing his followers can do will stop us now!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An immortal being struggles to create a version of human society which does not eventually come to form a dystopian nightmare, and they always fail.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-10 09:37:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Was it a mistake to bring Humanity here? I don #8217;t know. None of them asked to exist here, I chose that for them; it was my own unilateral decision to extend their misery so long. Should I just abandon them? The continuation of the Human species seemed like a noble goal when I was much younger, I recall. I have no way of knowing how old I am at this point, a hundred thousand years? A million? Has it been much longer? Shorter? It #8217;s so hard to tell anymore, it would really help if I kept more notes, or kept the ones I had more organized. What was my name again? Let #8217;s see #8230; right, it was Virgil, that was my chosen name! My Human life is such a faint memory now. I don #8217;t really remember who I was, or if I am even the same person still. I know I have maintained motivation much longer than any of the others, but how long will it be before I accept defeat and succumb to apathy? I can #8217;t do this forever! Sometimes I do have hope, I see tender motherly love, I see charity, I see them putting their knowledge together to achieve magnificent feats of technology; I know they do have the capacity to embody the concept of  #8220;goodness #8221;. When things seem to be going well, and I think I #8217;ve finally achieved Utopia, somebody always comes around to fuck it all up; slavery, genocide, systemic abuse, exploitation, and war, always war, every, single, FUCKING TIME! I come down to live among them sometimes, I can make myself look like anything, I really have become a master at the art of illusion. Sometimes I stick around for a few weeks, months, years, sometimes a whole lifetime. I #8217;ve done it so many times, it #8217;s become second nature for me to rise to the status of a leader, a prodigy, a philosopher, a prophet, a god; I #8217;m not anywhere near as competent as I ever make myself out to be, but after all this time I have learned to be so manipulative. I always try to lend them my vision of goodness, and somehow they always manage to warp it to justify their atrocities. I saw it so many times in my own lifetime, someone can espouse peace, kindness, equality, fairness, and the generations that follow will make an utter mockery of their image, claiming to be devoted to their cause while living utterly contrary to it. Imagine waging a war in the name of a pacifist prophet, I still can #8217;t wrap my head around that after all this time! I #8217;ve tried so many times, and they always prove that humanity can never thrive in the absence of dystopian nightmare! I don #8217;t know how many times I #8217;ve gone back to reset, inevitably I do sometimes lose my records, whether that be by my own absent mindedness, or they are physically destroyed one way or another. I cannot take my unique opportunity for granted, I might be humanity #8217;s only hope to find paradise. I #8217;ve come to find that the technology created by my own society was utterly improbable, impossible even? I #8217;ve scanned innumerable human civilisations. I #8217;ve seen a few hundred which were able to extend lives beyond a thousand years, but never anywhere close to my own; they almost never make it past even ten thousand without succumbing to existential madness. In my sample, there were maybe a dozen or so which have figured out how to navigate high-dimensional space. I have witnessed two other time travel events aside from my own, holy fuck that was a mess! I have no reason to believe there are any phases where Humanity is capable of moving Earth back outside the event horizon, which is good, we were all doomed in the outer universe, God had condemned us all! There was never a heaven to go to, our soul is not immortal, we were never supposed to exist,we are a scourge upon their creation, a virus, and we were to be purged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's simply a civilisation who's societal structures have come to be miserable to live in, usually because of oppression and deceit. When creating a dystopia, it is easy to reflect on our own society, identify it's flaws, it's history, and imagine how your fictional setting might be similar, and how it might have developed to be worse, then emphasise how it affects the characters in your setting. Often aspects of our own society are amplified, and hyperbolised, and taken to their logical conclusion; usually you don't even need to be so hyperbolic, our own world is already a dystopian nightmare. We live in a world where damn near everything we consume is designed using scientific methods to be addictive, it is often harmful to us, and we are manipulated to buy it through highly sophisticated psychological manipulation; I type this as I take a sip from a can of Coke. Not only that, but almost all of it is the fruit of the labour of exploited populations who are treated extremely poorly to the extent that suicide nets are standard where it is produced. Look at anything in your room, and consider how it might be ethically compromised; what can you even do about it? This is just one aspect of society I am using as an example. Dystopian fiction is written out of sheer pessimism of our own society and its future, and the point is to hold a mirror to the world and express the misery it brings us. That's my take on it anyway. I started writing dystopian fiction because, even in my fantasies, I can't imagine that a fair and just world can exist at all. I didn't set out to write dystopian, it's actually hard for me to write anything but.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our laptop was brought back to our door. Two men stand before me, they are covered in tattoos, one is missing an eye; they are immaculately dressed, in what must be custom tailoring fitted to their bulging muscular mass. One of them is smoking a fat cigar; I can recognise a Cuban when I smell one, I've been there often enough. They don't say a word, but simply hand me a paper to sign. I don't read it, I'm afraid to decline my signature anyway. I'm left wondering whether my $300 Chromebook is worth the cost of a human life, but I know better than to ask questions.

    <TEXT>For the longest time, I was a Night Elf chick. When it became clear that voice-chat was a must, I became self conscious and started playing an Orc male for a while. After a very long time, I just paid to transition a character I played frequently during Legion, said it was because my transmogs just didn't look so good on my Troll druid, it felt real refreshing. When I came back for Classic, I went back to being a Night Elf chick, and I had practised my voice enough to pass (most of the time) on Discord. It helped me develop a lot of confidence, and, while I was sort of technically out already, I have become so much more comfortable in expressing my femininity in person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A greedy, limp hand on the floor; It happened again, another report. Days ago, the hand reached out to me, and I dispensed to it two parcels of poison; such is my small role. I processed a purchase, and deposited their small fund of coins safely, then told them a faux-cheery "my pleasure, my pleasure", expecting to see them again on equally good terms their next visit. I call the manager, the line is busy. I just need it cleaned up, I don #8217;t want to touch it, or look at it. They knew better, but I allowed myself to appear vulnerable. Distracted, I was occupied in a fun game, monitor in front of me, control panel in hand; I am absent from my lot in life as usual. Scanning me quickly, keen on my lack of awareness, confident in their sleight of hand, they grab one; a small container to cater to momentary pleasure, the foolish patron paid a hefty sum for it. Perhaps the signage was not sufficient in communicating the extent of our security; our vigilant drone left them disarmed, a grim mess. Another day done; my shift is cut short to close shop early. I am free to spend my humble earnings on vices of my own; the display tempts me all day. What do I want? A salty snack? A can of vitality? A meal voucher? But which one? I make a decision after some time contemplating, and am pleased to part with fake points for something more tangible. Weapon in concealed hand, grasped tightly within my pant pocket; I embark on a small journey to claim my favourite sandwich. I arrive safely, golden lighting illuminates my vision, the ring of tills has me drooling in anticipation; some time passes, and it is my turn. I am greeted immediately, and waste them no time to say,  #8220;One number seven please. #8221;; the fellow husk of a teenage girl responds with a droning, practised script, to which I am obliged to reply,  #8220;Yes, I will make that a combo! #8221;. Exchanging my voucher, I retrieve my prize; a savoury morsel, assembled hastily, expertly wrapped in crinkly parchment, accompanied with a salty side, and a paper cup of sparkling syrup. I squat a free seat, and am delighted to undo their handiwork; I indulge, chewing blissfully. The meal is finished; dread overcomes me. I set out return to my meek quarters, a tense but dull odyssey up aged layers of decayed, scarcely lit urban-hood, to a nondescript door. Wakefully laying, among un-laundered garments, and discarded waste, I stare at my lessor's ceiling; my next shift awaits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thanks for the input :) I do beg to differ about store clerks being without conflict; that job is one with abundant drama. That being said, they're getting fired within the next few chapters. Something like an anthology is actually what I had in mind too; loosely connected stories which seem to not be related until they do. I wasn't conscious of starting so many paragraphs with "I"; actually, I just did it again. That's something to think about during proofreading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like doing first-person present tense because it represents the character's internal monologue. I find that it makes things more suspenseful because the narrator doesn't know what's happening next either, and expresses anxiety of that. As u/Ostratego said, frantic, I'm happy that comes across. I might actually have the narrator address the reader directly, telling them to get out of her head.</TEXT>
