    <TEXT>I dont know if they will bring the ardent nerf.It is way too big nerf and it will bring down all enhancer supports.They removed the healing and now they will cut to half the on hit dmg and the attack speed. For bardians is good thing although cause he is not a healing support.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about screen replacement</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-21 14:02:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>My gba sp had his screen broke(it fell ) and the screen is white(but the gameboy works,only screen broke up).I was thinking about replacing the screen.Although,the screen replacement for sp is 40-50$ and i dont think its worth to invest so much money cause i dont even know for sure if i will be able to replace it with success.So i was thinking to replace it with a gba screen that costs 5$.(they have the same size but it doesnt have backlight afaik). So my real question is : Can i replace a gba sp screen with a gba screen?Or it is incompatible? Also do you know if gba sp uses only 40 pin screen?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its funny that riot didnt said that they will give only 40 ppl out of 200! challengers flex the rewards when season was on, but only after it ended! If your mindset was that you wanted to make it fair,then why you dont give oce challengers solo/duo only top 10 rewards,cause korea server is more difficult than oce ? But you used this mindset for flex vs solo/duo and you didnt said anything till season end. Who knows next season maybe players that play low difficulty champion dont get rewards,or something else weird.... Everyone would be happy if you had announced this but you wanted challengers to play more cause they thought they will get reward... Just to know RIOT,this season less than 1/4 last year challengers will play ranked and most challengers will be d3 players... No reason to tryhard and get flamed/trolled/abused/racism 1 in 2 games for 500 games and in the end, even if you end challenger you get nothing!NOT EVEN THE CHALLENGER RECALL! Why to tryhard when you can troll in normals,have fun and still earn the same things as ranked? Dont play ranked guys if you play for the rewards,every season they change everything last moment without anyone can do nothing! Sry for long post,ex-challenger here in flex that didnt had time to collect 600 points and tried flex for the 350 points challenger TLDR: Dont play rankeds for rewards,RIOT is unstable with their future decisions. Normal games gt;Rankeds(rankeds stressful,normals are chill)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem is that Challengers can duo.Last season you couldnt duo when you were in challenger,so only the very best players could stay in top 200.Now you can play with your duo smurf and easily achieve it.Randoms vs randoms is more fair than randoms vs premades. The problem with Riots challenger duo abuse is simple.They cant make it fair without losing something.Here is why: If they make it like last season(only solo),the challenger queue time will go up by a lot,and all the challengers will just smurf in other accounts cause they cant wait 1 hour to find game. If they keep having the current system,it will not be fair EXCEPT if they implement the rule premades vs premades (1 prem vs 1 prem) or (2 prem vs 2 prem).It will add some queue time but it will be fair for everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Duo queue shouldnt exist in challenger(it was like this last season).Challengers are supposed to be players good enough to go pro.So someone going pro,isnt good enough without his duo? I have seen lulu,taric,janna players playing like low plat players and getting carried by twitch, yi etc. smurfs to challenger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi fellow summoners, i am looking for a clash team to join for the upcoming clash. I am support main but playing from s3 in multiple servers and accounts kinda forced me to play every role in a good level. Before season 8 that we didnt had role selection, i was autofilling most of the games so teammates can play their mains. My preffered roles are supp  gt; top  gt; Jungle  gt;mid  gt;adc. I look for gold teammates ( or low plat) so we play at the respective tier. My summoner name in EUW : Youlostagaindude You can also message me in reddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am plat 3 eune (d2 in my main eune) and i am looking for a tier 2 clash team. I can fill ( cause i have played this game way too long from a lot of accounts). Only thing i demand is positive attitude team (not toxic quitting teammates in the middle of the tournament). Its only a game why you have to be mad? My ign is : emperor argos I can use mic but i prefer to play without mic so i can focus better ingame.We can communicate surprisingly good with pings ingame. I will be able to participate on monday (12/10).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[EUNE][GOLD-PLAT] I am looking for mid/jgl/top mains for clash.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-15 15:03:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am looking for mid/jgl/top MAINS AND NOT OTP'S for weekend's clash. Ideally Tier 3 but not necessary. We are already bot premades and we are building a team for this weekend clash. Big rewards from missions in this championship clash. No mic is required. I believe we will play more focused if we communicate only through pings. Drafts will be done ingame chat.  #8203; You can add me in game IGN : Emperor Argos  #8203; We play to win but with respect. We never give up and we are not toxic.</TEXT>
