    <TEXT>My Warner Theater was in Lawrence Massachusetts. Home of the infamous Theater Row. At one time from the 30's through the 60's Lawrence held, and will forever hold, the record of having 8, that's 8 large art deco movie theaters in only a two block span. You can Google "theater row Lawrence Massachusetts" and you'll see pictures and some artist's renditions. When I was young only 1 of the theaters of the 8 was still running. Some were leveled, some were empty eventually leveled. The Warner was 5 blacks near the downtown section and finally closed around 1974. It's a shame there aren't too many of these theaters in operation any more. I live in Florida and there is a beautiful one that operates in Tampa which is as almost 2 hours from me. We have lived here for only 9 years. I haven't got there yet but I will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Didn't love it. Too big a budget led to too much CGI. Not enough practical effects. I would think a lower, and in this movies case, an extremely lower budget so the filmmakers would have to more creative and practical. No big name stars. I see Brad Pitt on the movie screen I don't see the character he's portraying I see Brad Pitt acting as the character he is portraying. Brad Pitt is not an actor associated with the horror genre. A capable, mostly unknown or underrated actor in the lead would have been better. Zombie movies in a more claustrophobic setting are scarier than say the big action scene where the CGI zombies are piling up to go over the wall. Impressive sure but doesn't belong in a zombie movie. Has there been a zombie movie before or after this one with a scene like that? No. For good reason. It doesn't work. And lest we forget although this movie made good money, not great but good. World war Z globally made just over 540 million dollars and its filming budget was close to 200 million. Halloween in 2018 made 256 million dollars costing only 20 million to make. Factor in the high costs of marketing World War Z to the masses who outside of geeks like us wouldn't know what it was from the title, thus an extremely large amount of money was used to market it. Halloween has a built in marketing plan, hundreds of horror sites, word of mouth plus it's a franchise. Now which movie made the most PROFIT after all is said and done. According to Wikipedia Halloween made a bigger profit than world war z. Yes I researched this before I answered the question. And there is a reason I know I'm right. They have been trying to get a sequel to world war z for years but no studio will do it. It's not even mentioned on imdb.com And Halloween, not only have they finished the sequel coming this october their filming the third and last movie now that's coming out in October 2021. So I think that answers a) which movie was profitable and b) will we see a world war z 2. It's been 8 years since the original so I don't think it will happen, unless it a cheapo direct to streaming service type of movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 1951 version is one of my favorite scifi movies. The characters in it are all for the most part likeable. The 1982 as good as it is due mostly to Kurt Russell and having a truly gruesome alien, most of the other characters are unlikable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On one of the directors commentaries he said the version of the movie has every shot that they could have possibly found. He goes on to say that the first time the film was going to be rated X (there was no NC17 then). So they made the cuts that is the theatrical version. However, when they were putting together the directors cut they still had 3 to 4 minutes that were missing. So this directors cut contains everything that was shot from original sources that exist. They have no idea where the missing 3 to 4 minutes shots are. To his recollection those shots were only character fillers not effects shots which were also trimmed at the same time and since they were of no importance they were probably thrown away. But he was positive every effect cut that was removed to get an (R) is in this print.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually enjoyed this because the low budget and it taking place mainly in the woods gave it more atmosphere. When The Burning started the rafting scene, not the gore part but when they were rafting, it looses something. Sometimes a bigger budget doesn't mean a better movie. Its good don't get me wrong. But Madman is better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends what people contribute. Bad movies is a terrific subreddit. It's what people post that hopefully will make the difference. I'm not trying to take their followers, I just want people who like these films know there is also another site cantering to them. We may have posts from people that they don't. Like what's the difference between this site you're on and the other large cult film subreddit. It just gives people MORE of what they want.</TEXT>

The ONLY part I found amusing is when a young guy finds Barbara and takes her to his house, the people there are watching the original 1968 NOTLD on TV and she does a double take. Otherwise a complete waste of time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they tagged you for Ghoulies which has absolutely no inappropriate content, it means you've been tagged by them for some reason and they are watching almost your every move. Don't bother to try to find out why. Youtube does not have any live humans to answer emails, complaints, plus their phone number is hard to find but you won't find a human there either. I learned all this from experience. They run by algorithms so you're account or any youtube postings to your subreddit is flagged and looked at again. For Ghoulies whatever your posting was read it over for words that are obviously innocent but can have a double meaning.</TEXT>
