    <TEXT>wow, I actually almost forgot of the existence of this site. so i sat for a huge exam at the end of last year and then i went on an almost a month long island hopping trip. so from experience i can say that my ideal vacation is nature and beach vacation. I don't quite like city walking, maybe a little bit of sightseeing is ok but the hustle and bustle of big city give me unnecessary stress, plus the noise pollution. so far i've been meditating on what to do next with my life, what i shall pursue and in the meantime, I'm also picking up french and german (lol I'm crazy about Proust and Kafka). I've been making so much progress with French, I actually took an online test the other day where I got rated as C1. Tbh they obviously overgraded me because it's only a comprehension, listening and grammar test. but now I'm thinking of sitting for a real exam. i guess this proves that you can pick up a language by yourself! german is slow coz I kinda overdid it with french lol. I'm not sure if I'm gonna be redditing a lot after this or maybe leaving this site altogether, but for the time being I'm focusing my energy to make some major decisions on where life will take me :D</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-30 22:13:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>there is a daily influx of posts making fun of trans people in this sub . in a matter of hours, there can already be 5-6 posts. even when the post itself is not overtly transphobic, the toxic nature of the sub turns threads into a cesspool of transphobic circlejerk that dehumanises trans people. With a huge base of subscribers, the disproportionate focus is telling. at this point they might as well be renamed r/transinaction.  #8203; * In this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i0p3wc/just_blatant_biphobia/), [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i0p3wc/just_blatant_biphobia/fzqwm52?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x) are suggesting that the LGBT movement should exclude trans community, with common transphobic tropes like trans people are [mentally ill, depressed or bipolar](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i0p3wc/just_blatant_biphobia/fzqwm52?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x), or that trans people have hijacked the community. * [In this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/hzqj1t/i_am_trans_because_i_want_to_be_gay/) the OP is blatantly telling a gay trans man that he is not trans, but rather a straight girl who fetishizes gay men, which is just blatant transphobia. it only follows that the comments are calling him as **fujoshi** \- a pejorative term usually reserved for homophobic, straight cis girls who creep on and fetishize gay men and their relationships. so not only are they calling him cis, but also a pervert. and there are also numerous people quoting the banned sub "r/itsafetish" in the comment section. * In this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i0qp62/2020_is_the_year_of_redefining_biology/), being trans is a [fetish](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i0qp62/2020_is_the_year_of_redefining_biology/fzr7z8u?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x). * In this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/hzmvav/dont_mind_me_im_just_stretching/fzkv63y?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x), apparently trans woman have the agenda to erase cis women, steal their scholarships, invade rape shelters, and used up all gynecologists. * [post 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/hzim3o/fuck_you_for_being_positive/) * [post 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/hzqemi/harry_potter_and_the_white_supremacist_biology/) * [post 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i08w4a/genital_configuration/) * [post 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i08u0i/cant_imagine_why_we_dont_want_these_people_in/) * [post 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i0kqvn/if_you_believe_that_only_women_can_get_periods/) the purpose of so many tagged post is to show how much they talk about trans people for the past hours. there are more but I think that should be enough. there have been reports in the pasts where social media accounts in other platforms like tumblr and twitter are being harassed by the users from this sub. even though usernames can be easily concealed, it's not hard at all to google the accounts. i have even seen comments in that sub saying they will make a tumblr/twitter account just to harass the users without any intervention from the mods while other subscribers encourage them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-21 14:07:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>from last post, the creator of the transphobic hate sub r/goodanimemes was revealed to be a [racist transphobe](https://i.redd.it/zcgzyw84vyg51.png). for damage control, [the mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/icwfeg/important_changes_concerning_the_subreddit/) are coddling the users saying they are so sorry to inform that they must follow reddit TOS so that their sub doesn't get banned, without firmly addressing the raiding of r/animemes, the transphobia and racism , and the userbase organizing a raid on the sub in discord groups. they are sending death threats to the mods and their families and making fun of a known suicide attempt. the way that the r/goodanimemes coddles up to these baby terrorists is only a way to garner support for newfound sub and indirectly spur on the war by indirectly taking part and contributing to the "war narrative". the top mod also released a [mod announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/i6cbvl/to_all_our_members_transparency/) coddling up racists and transphobes, saying that "freedom of speech" will be protected, in light of their founder being a violent and racist transphobe. [the current top mod further defended the transphobe by saying that he is not a hateful person but rather just "open".](https://i.redd.it/78i5fopuw7h51.png) [Proof](https://i.redd.it/05an43ocp9h51.png) that the discord sub was littered with people organizing and cheering the attack ,as well as making fun of a known suicide attempt, before the mod reluctantly stepped in at the behest of admins. [here is a former moderator](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeeDownfall/comments/idlafv/the_ranimemes_breakdown_ama_with_zeedownfall/g2a199v/) confirming that 12 or more mods were forced to leave the team after themselves and their families started receiving death threats, swats, and allegedly their SSNs may have gotten leaked somewhere as well. this should suffice to prove that r/goodanimemes is just a transphobic hatesub, going so far as violently targeting the mods just for unrestricted use of a transphobic slur.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>r/goodanimemes, a sub created by a racist transphobe to evade a slur ban, stole a trans artwork made by a trans creator to make up a mascot whose name is a transphobic slur just to provoke trans community, thus breaking their own promise of not referring to any trans character as a t***.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 05:32:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>From last post, r/goodanimemes was created by a [racist transphobe](https://preview.redd.it/zcgzyw84vyg51.png?width=960 amp;crop=smart amp;auto=webp amp;s=1a8b2f1cde527d9fab06f37963e9345d33d9133e) as an evasion sub for unrestricted use of transphobic slur. At this rate it seems like the mods of r/goodanimemes and its userbase are hell bent on giving hell to trans community by doxxing and swatting the mods of r/animemes, and sending death threats to their families, which resulted in the whole sub getting shut down. To double down, the mods decided to pick a transphobic slur used to incite and justify violence and murder against trans people as its [mascot](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/i9205m/reintroducing_trapuchan_our_mascot/), just to provoke trans community. In so doing, the mods have stolen a trans character created by a trans creator (won't be named to avoid unnecessary exposure and risk being attacked by transphobes from r/goodanimemes, a good number of people have fallen) , who is dubbed as smug t\*\*\*-chan in the sub, therefore doubling down on transphobia. [Stolen trans artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/i9p4hs/i_see_you_joined_rgoodanimemes/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share) other threads for reference [https://www.reddit.com/r/animecirclejerk/comments/ifjkqj/the\_irony\_would\_kill\_me\_if\_it\_didnt\_make\_me\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/animecirclejerk/comments/ifjkqj/the_irony_would_kill_me_if_it_didnt_make_me_go/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/animecirclejerk/comments/ig041c/can\_you\_imagine\_taking\_someone\_elses\_post\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/animecirclejerk/comments/ig041c/can_you_imagine_taking_someone_elses_post_and/) adding on, their obsessive and constant need to meme about how trans coded characters like Ferris and Astolfo are male t\*\*\*\* is also indefensibly transphobic or at least homophobic in nature. it's invalidating, dehumanizing and perpetuates prejudice against non-cis people. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxeB2AXIG3E amp;t=810s) provides partial explanation why.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those of you who have been banned by trans subs and anime subs, do not come here to air your grievances. This is not a discussion sub. It's a circlejerk sub. Don't complain about being banned if you haven't read the side bar. We adopt the same rules as other trans subs and ban eternal questions like "what constitute a slur". We have already enforced moratorium on such questions and you won't be the first account to be banned. Having said that, this sub is being heavily brigaded and some people might have ended up being banned despite being well-meaning and if that's the case please make a ban appeal and we will review your ban. However, being two-faced and rallying your supporters to shower the mods with death threats will not help your case. the same goes to those who post and rally people in hate subs known to brigade, doxx and swat redditors. being a truscum, terf, homophobe, etc, or posting in said subs, are all also added bonus. Follow the rules and happy circlejerking!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no need to use any trollish political lingos that does not help us. I know that you're trying to do a dialogue here and i understand you're trying to humanize your opponents. but i find that people sometimes under estimate how polarised americans are. i mean even if i were to be optimistic and think that most republicans are like sam harris, jordan peterson or christopher hitchens then still america be damned. I'm not even saying that right wingers are racist or anything like. I'm talking about people who dabble with apologia. Like some people will say "cops are not evil they also don't agree with excessive use of force and have the capacity to self-check" without realizing that cops have a widespread police brutality culture, and the biggest cop sub here is frequently featured in r/AHS for glorifying and justifying murder. they identify with the punisher, which is literally a critic of mindless and violent vigilante justice. maybe you're still having your post pubescent ben shapiro reawakening but I'm sure you will see it one day, that it's kinda pointless and nitpicky to talk about people saying "orange man bad" in the face of widespread death during a global pandemic and riot. no need to feel bad for trump if you actually think he's bad, or not.</TEXT>

Reddit is a heavily moderated space, like too heavily moderated, and we still see subs like r/police and r/protectandserve and i feel like you're the one underestimating polarization here. it's not some assholes, r/psa is a huge sub rub by cops and they admit to swatting redditors. police unions are openly advocating violence. it's not just "some ass holes" or "not all cops". I'm not sure whether you're being genuine here or not because well. all in all, it's just seem silly to complain about trump memes, it just reeks of conservative fragility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>people in the LGBTQ-positive crowd are usually big on consent and sexual assault issues. however, screaming rape and sexual assault is a common dog whistling technique among TERs to derail the discussion and attack and vilify trans people. sure, you can defend the sub, not like it has no merit, but your intention is plain to see when you went down that road.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>important thing to note that the commenters ignore: the post itself is disingenous and hiding behing false science. because then it should have been more specific and should have transgender column too, because there are also trans specific medical concerns. heck ,it does not even have other also medically relevant signifiers like intersex?  #8203; the problem with trans people ( and other non cisgenders) in health insurance is not misgendering or disclosing their trans status/assigned gender. This is a huge strawman that is always used to vilify and dismiss trans concerns. in fact most trans people are misgendered for their whole lives. most trans people are fine with that and support medicine more than your transphobic aunties, but it's the fact that insurance policies allegedly exclude trans people from their coverage even for routine procedures for cis people on the grounds of being trans. and this means cutting the accessibility to life-changing treatments. edit: apparently the OP is a manipulative coward who cropped the whole picture where a doctor came in to murder the transphobes by words :[https://external-preview.redd.it/6I\_gl8Zd7RoVASS0-syEiB3bgnhtl-bUCNJF-Xz3gA0.png?auto=webp amp;s=35acd7afec6b7c149bf80f03dd21a0504e4bc1dd](https://external-preview.redd.it/6I_gl8Zd7RoVASS0-syEiB3bgnhtl-bUCNJF-Xz3gA0.png?auto=webp amp;s=35acd7afec6b7c149bf80f03dd21a0504e4bc1dd)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i think it depends. people nowadays identify with words in the way they are used and i think it makes sense. pan has come to mean gender blind. where as bi has come to mean that gender still plays an role in attraction. and in my experience this has been the case for most people. so naturally people will choose what defines them best what they are comfortable. for me, i see them both as distinct sexualities with considerable overlap. because obviously people won't like it when they get grouped together and not being appreciated for who they are. and people certainly don't need to feel ashamed if they are bi and not gender blind. that's what is wrong. imo this kind of meme is not ideal. because on one hand you'll see meme in r/pan complaining about bisexuals erasing pansexuals whereas here you'll see memes of of pansexuals erasing bisexuals. at least it must state that brad might identify as pan instead and that's ok too. i feel like r/pan and r/bi should do like a healthy exchange between them and become sister subs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i think people are of 2 camps. 1. those who think that bi and pan are different 2. those who think pansexuality is a subset of bisexuality. i don't think any of them are outright wrong but in my experience, pans are mad when you call them bi and vice versa. for a lot of bi people, gender is a factor and that's why they identify as bi, and in my experience, bisexuals who are into all genders usually would rather identify as omnisexual, rather than pan, because they don't think that pansexuality is part of bisexuality, or that the word pansexuality actually describes them. idk, i just feel like 1 is safer because it's the more descriptive approach to sexuality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>when straight boys want a gf who's like a bro, they don't actually mean that they want a girl with masculine interest. it's just a common misogynistic trope in popular culture to shame women with feminine interest and to control women overall. basically it's just like r/notlikeothergirls, but the male version. this video explains it : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEKNFX7LWRk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEKNFX7LWRk)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's a problem when people think it's ok to refer to them as the t-word, which is a transphobic slur used against trans people in schools and social media, and they hide behind the loophole of "it's ok because he's a cis boy", not realizing that ferris is dysphoric of both her dead name and male pronouns. her gender should be her own business, but it becomes problematic when she becomes the punching bag for transphobic punchlines, which provides a loophole for transphobes to perpetuate transphobic attacks without actually targetting trans people, which is still harmful in the end. ferris is a Schr #246;dinger's trans. her transness always depends on the narrators and audience for their own purpose. she is a result of a cis author not knowing or bothering with the differences between a femboy, trans woman and crosdresser. in short, her gender is inconsequential, a slur is a slur regardless of the recipient's gender. so, stop shielding and enabling transphobes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ok then my bad for assuming but I'm here to talk about transphobia inanime community, and not to discuss about dysphoria among femboys and crossdressers and was derailed by your statement. the main point is that Ferris is a Schr #246;dinger's trans and people are pushing that she's cis, not GNC or trans, just so that they can use a slur. you can discuss ferris gender all you want, but that's not my point, because their endgame is to justify slurs. it doesn't matter what her gender is eventually because what I'm addressing is transphobia and it's harmful towards anyone who's not perceived to be cisheteronormative. and eventually femboys and crossdressers who are cis will identify as cis, and my point is that they won't go so far as praying that they are female everyday, and assume female identity at all time, as what happened with ferris. you are probably right, but femboy is a femboy and a crossdresser is a crossdresser and to that extent, i think i'm well aware. I know that dysphoria and dysmorphia are not trans specific, even cis people can experience dysphoria and dysmorphia too, you totally misunderstood me. i was being context specific. it does not matter if you're trans here, because what I'm explaining is perfectly sensible. i was just ticked off cause i was derailed and i thought you were trolling. I'm not here to fight with you but others, you're the one who inserted yourself. yes you can correct me, but if your main contention is not against me then be less confrontational maybe. you might not mean it, but in the process, you end up enabling, validating and shielding transphobe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hi, ofc there's nothing inherently bad about wanting a bro who shares the same interests with you. ofc the obligatory disclaimer, boys do not have the monopoly on masculine interests, such girls do exists but they are not exactly the walking male fantasy either. i was talking about the popular bro-y cool girl tropes and #notlikeothergurls that's imminent in popular culture. and it's not only boys, but teenage girls pick this up from movies as well, written by socially awkward males, like transformers, written by Michael Bay, who sexualised minors and portrayed them in wet bikinis. this is more of a discussion of tropes in pop culture actually. if you're not affected by it, it's cool. but the video explains it well. sorry for being overly critical, to soften things up you can see this as society against females, rather than boys against girls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, the point here is not to say that girls with masculine interest don #8217;t exist or that they are putting an act, but rather the problematic cool girl trope that is portrayed in pop culture and people #8217;s expectation surrounding it. It #8217;s not so much to criticize j law #8217;s and anne hathaway #8217;s personality i think, or anyone #8217;s personality for that matter, but rather how people react to them and pit them against each other, unnecessarily comparing the two. Ofc teenage boys and girls pick this up to some extent and view female individuality as something bad, which gives rise to common joke like how something is bad because a 14 year old girl would like it and maybe we feel like oh it #8217;s just a joke but it does have misogynist origin and it #8217;s learned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the snarky tone of this comment doesn't come off as genuine but i will bite. seriously, you're just unfamiliar with LGBT media. silence of the lambs and various other media haven been scrutinized, even anime and manga are not free of scrutiny when it come to trans representation. male authors, especially if they are cis, are often examined closely in this community. i find this insulting and funny, and very counter productive to your cause. a person who is not transphobic will not have to justify themselves. actions speak louder than words. going through her words only reaffirm her radical gender essentialist stance. words like trans-identifies instead of trans, natal/biological instead of cis, etc are only terven dog whistles meant to invalidate trans people, because well, we all know that JK Rowling thinks that trans women are not biological woman, because she thinks that only woman menstruate, not trans men. you might not know or realize it, because dog whistles do exactly that, and as a learned woman who has done "a lot of research" she knows what she's doing. I can already foresee how you're gonna reply to this, but my preemptive rebuttal is that you don't get to use nazi dog whistle and then claim that you're not a nazi. and to add, i've read pages of her book and they are just poor in taste, reeks of transphobia and cis sexism.</TEXT>

JKRowling has not yet outstaged silence of the lambs, that I assure you.  gt;You're entitled to your opinion. you're out of your world, it's clear that JKR is a trans exclusionary whose method to deal with trans people is reluctant acceptance. i did not say JKR is a nazi too, not sure what you're implying here, but if she is, I;m not surprised either. let's just say JKR is a dishonest person, for years and years, she smeared Jeremy Corbyn of antisemitism, a man who stood up many times for Jews, but of course she backed up Magdalene bern, who is literally pushing that trans people are a jewish ploy by George Soros, and the same time used the same antisemitic tropes in her books too. her anti-antisemitism schtick is performative, just like her LGBT support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;People have always been suspicious of JK Rowling as a TERF despite her pro LGBT marketing gimmick, and she eventually came out when she took issues with health organisation that uses the term " people who menstruate", saying that such words are offensive and they are called women, when it is merely a descriptive physiology used by medical and healthcare personnel worldwide to be more objective and inclusive. to illustrate, trans men are also susceptible to breast, ovarian and cervical cancer.  gt;  gt;this could only just be silly banter, but in her efforts to double down, JK Rowling went on to talk about biological sex and sex-based rights, which exclude trans people, both trans men women and men, and people who exist in the fringes. in her further attempts at justifying this shitshow, she went on to talk about sexual abuse towards cis women somehow pinning male violence on trans women, and how gay women are undergoing conversion therapy in the modern world by undergoing transition, and how transgender medicine is hoax, saying how hormone therapy is being handed out as easy as antidepressants which is another willful ignorance. basically she just outed herself by a series of recycled and old transphobic tropes and thus perpetuating transphobia. she's also putting a lot of effort by disproportionately portraying detransitioning  gt;  gt; she is also rallying, uniting and mobilizing antiLGBT groups, such as transtrenders, whose members openly oppose gay marriage, and currently backing an antiLGBT group that is campaigning against a conversion therapy ban bill.  gt;  gt;the latest issue is when her books are basically just the reboot of silence of the lambs, that further mystifies and perpetuates the gross caricature of trans women as serial killers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>important to note than she's using a lot of terven dog whistles that are designed to incite different people differently, and to invalidate trans people. for example saying trans-identified instead of trans, and natal/biological instead of cis. the reluctance to use neutral institutionalized language, like how she has problem with the phrase "people who menstruate", a phrase used by medical institution to include trans men, is a way to rally transphobes. it's like saying she's not a nazi while using nazi dog whistles in the same sentence. it's the most bizarre thing to read. also another thing to add, JKR spent years smearing Corbyn of antisemitism, but she defends Magdalene Berns who literally said that trans people are a jewish ploy by George Soros. Let's just say she's just a rich white woman looking out for her own interests, and her anti-antisemitism schtick is performative like her LGBT support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>um no, cis is perfectly neutral and used in academia and the medical field , as well as the phrase "people who menstruate". terms like biological woman is redundant, loaded and often intertwined with certain ideological factions, and in this case, used to misgender trans men.

    <TEXT>doctors will always be up in arms to fight people who hide their bigotry behind false science. your genotype or your karyotype are not your sex. people seem to like appropriating scientific snippets without any basic understanding of genetics to mask their bigotry. so your sex is not XX or XY, that statement alone is a testament of gender essentialists' lack of scientifc understanding. ultimately, sex is a collective of anatomical and physiological phenotype. the expression of sexual characteristics span the entire gamut of "sexual types", but more importantly, *outward phenotype is not a guarantee of internal organ type consonance and is not a guarantee of psychological / brain structure phenotype*. that is to say; They are a ***bimodal distribution,*** *with people having true anatomic ambiguity in the middle.* the expression of your sexual characteristics is not linear, or easily determined by your chromosomal configuration. monoploidy and polyploidy aside, even those born with normal sexual chromosomes like XY can still be born with a vagina, and vice versa. your phenotypic expression happens at various stages, even post-DNA. a lot of difference, genetic or not, can result in different hormonal configuration which alter one's primary and secondary sexual characteristics, and therefore they should not be expected to conform to the cissexism binary, which can be costly and damaging to their health, socially, physiologically and psychologically. that's why in the end, doctors will still run tests like karyotyping to be sure of one's karyotype because you can't see someone's karyotype, and even so, karyotype does not determine your sex nor your gender, as has been seen in various medical cases, and ultimately it's up to the patient, and such is the standard duty of care. eventually, sex is a mosaic, and gender essentialism is prohibited in medicine. here's a doctor telling off transphobes : [https://i.imgur.com/wCK7QiS.png](https://i.imgur.com/wCK7QiS.png)</TEXT>

I'm not delusional, I've noticed that a lot of people have asked me to do bareback, but safe sex is still normal. last i checked, the majority of gays are average looking, don't have abs, and don't post thirst traps on insta. nor are they into fisting or PnP. and now that you say this, in my whole life i think i have only mentioned fisting once in our discussion. narcissism is not a gay problem. straight people use insta too. most of the eye candy I follow on insta are straight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i guess that's where we disagree. promiscuity is like blue chesse or durian. it's not for everyone but as long as you practice safe sex, it should be ok. having said that a lot of, if not most, gay people actually despise promiscuity and even the idea of open relationship. that's like the commonest drama in r/askgaybros and other gay subs, like gay people literally slapfight over it. like i say, if your problem is promiscuity, then you're not special too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah sorry tho. i think people will accept this better if you go straight to body image issues and mental health of gay people. but the way you seem to take a prudish and judgmental stance about it made it seem a bit incel-ish and r/notlikeothergurlz. must say, i hate those pick me up gays who are all "i'm not like other gurlz" whose stance usually reeks of internalized homophobia and cishetero acceptance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>relax, i didn't say that's you. i said that's how it is usually. sorry tho, but i didn't mean the last part for you. and the first sentence is about how you came off. and next, have you actually gone to pride. most of the time people talk about this with me they end up sharing articles that purposely use photos form SF sex carnival which is a different event altogether. though I'm sure there are also people who dress scantily during pride, especially those men in bikini from companies who wanted to capitalize on pride. but most of the time, pride is actually a boring event where people just march for hours, with other more pressing drama that people tend to miss, like cops, BLM and zionist pinkwashing issues. but don't get me wrong, i'm not against people stripping in the middle of riots, that shit is supposed to make people feel comfortable. if someone feels like that's part of their MO, then so be it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. we already have 9 movies, even with 2 movies, there was already plenty of chances. seriously. 2. dumbledore was announced as gay after the books have already been published. it's retroactive writing at this point. and a weird one as well. that's the most popular sentiment, even among hardcore HP fans. dumbledore's past was a dramatic and important part of the movie not just "one book out of seven". like I said, that's already plenty of chance. you're just playing the "being doubtful" game here without actually genuinely contributing to the discussion. 3. having said all that, there are all kinds of interpretation one can come out with all the metaphors in Harry Potter, going around obnoxiously harassing others for minute details in several different threads is not a good look for you. and it's out of place and narcissistic for you to call others sketchy, and rude too, when you don't actually have much to stand on yourself. especially that trollish point about sheriff's badge being a star of david? it's hard to think that you're arguing in good faith.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i see. usually i'd feel annoyed by people badgering others for stuff they can learn themselves, more often than not they turn out to be sealions, but i guess i'm feeling charitable today. disclaimer: it annoys me a bit when people complain "it's about being PC" as if people are at fault for taking offense when the problem is bigotry and ignorance. now let's see is FDS really transphobic and misandrist? it seems like the sub, and the mods as well, have a long history of transphobia. One of the mods pouts about Female Dating Strategy being labeled as trans-exclusive, but then goes on to say that being trans is simply about  #8220;putting on a dress #8221; [here](https://www.reveddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dejlx2/can_we_not_downvote_posts_where_girls_fucked_up/). This same mod accuses trans women of invading female spaces for using [her](https://www.reveddit.com/v/TrueOffMyChest/comments/df91a3/trans_women_dont_exist/f31p91r/) bathrooms. Same mod asks [ #8220;how can you tell the difference between a trans woman and a sex offender in a dress](https://www.reveddit.com/v/TrueOffMyChest/comments/df91a3/trans_women_dont_exist/f32rcyx/#t1_f32rcyx)? #8221; This mod also refers to trans women #8217;s genitals as mutilated [here](https://www.reveddit.com/v/TrueOffMyChest/comments/df91a3/trans_women_dont_exist/f31q2gi/). More lies revealed: she also admits to banning trans women from FDS [here](https://www.reveddit.com/v/TheBluePill/comments/efxnx4/terfs_from_rfemaledatingstrategy_finally_embrace/fc3ji6e/), **and then goes on to claim that being trans is a** [**mental disorder**](https://www.reveddit.com/v/TheBluePill/comments/efxnx4/terfs_from_rfemaledatingstrategy_finally_embrace/fc3lhft/#t1_fc3lhft)**.** Second mod blames trans women for causing discrimination against lesbians [here](https://www.reveddit.com/v/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/iatmti/ive_noticed_something_and_statistics_prove_me/g1vl2tb/). Third mod writes a long essay (littered with grammatical errors) on how transgender individuals are just a part of some [big pharma conspiracy](https://www.reveddit.com/v/LabourUK/comments/estjm4/trans_rights_are_human_rights/ffd3lg7/). This mod also thinks that trans people are [more likely to be a murdered than be a victim](https://www.reveddit.com/v/LabourUK/comments/estjm4/trans_rights_are_human_rights/ffd5g5p/). She also refers to trans women as  #8220;[blokes in lipstick](https://www.reveddit.com/v/unpopularopinion/comments/dh99j8/there_should_be_more_empowerment_for_young_men/f3mlj41/) #8221; This same mod misgenders trans women [here](https://www.reveddit.com/r/GenderCynical/comments/co7254/calling_someone_a_terf_is_hate_speech/ewic4fv/). Fourth mod also misgenders trans women [here](https://www.reveddit.com/v/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/fm0pt9/its_like_being_pro_people_of_color_but_not/fl3b4lq/), and [here](https://www.reveddit.com/v/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/fm0pt9/its_like_being_pro_people_of_color_but_not/fl2zax4/). in time, i hope you'll outgrow FDS and see how toxic its outlook on dating is. it's like FDS and [r/incels](https://www.reddit.com/r/incels/) are match made in heaven. the same outlook and almost the same lingo and algorithm when it comes to dating. it's just the inverse of incel philosophy where they view sexual and romantic relationship as transaction and humans as commodity with grades. for example, the pinned thread is openly telling women not to date men who split bills. and it only takes a few comments before the whole thread devolves into transphobia, with badanatomy and badphysiology, just an incarnate of [r/incels](https://www.reddit.com/r/incels/). not realizing that men who prefer to pay usually see it as a transaction and more likely to sexually assault their partners ([r/leopardatemyface](https://www.reddit.com/r/leopardatemyface/) ?) it's just bad advice overall. source : [https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-19050-001](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-19050-001) similarly, an incel will also say they are entitled for sex after paying for dinner, because they also view sex as a transaction. once a top post there was about a woman who "had finally dumped her trans boyfriend". she insisted that her ex will never be a man and the relationship was doomed from the start, and she kept misgendering him and calling him a woman. imagine doing that to someone you have loved for years? of course the thread devolved further into transphobia. in fact the sub has their own vocab for trans men : TIF or trans identified female, simply meant to invalidate and misgender trans men. all in all, i hope you can see. and please realize this is an LGBTQ sub. it's supposed to be a safe space and free of any kind of gender hatred.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is very interesting, when some people think they can claim the monopoly on the word genocide that they somehow believe that the annihilation of villages that resulted in an immediate refugee crisis and widespread killing does not constitute a genocide. and of course, the allusion to spontaneous fleeing, another racist trope. what is my agenda? saying that i have an agenda for stating the ethnic cleansing and genocide of palestinians is like saying that trans people have an agenda for calling for law reforms. quarelling over semantics is an obscurantist method to derail the subject topic. so even if we're in an alternate universe where you're right that it's ethnic cleansing, not genocide, still does not mean that it's less evil and my salient point remains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Israeli's really need to open their minds and stop paying attention to corrupt politicians. palestinians probably hate their similarly corrupt, autocratic token government only a little bit less than israel. having said that PLO have accepted Israel since the 80s and PNC was amended according to Oslo accords, which was botched in its final stages, so the question of the existence of Israel has never been a contention for a few decades already now. unless of course, the rights of Israel's to exist happen at the expense of the fundamental rights of palestinians as refugees. like i said alot of it is semantics, by the abstraction of the right to exist itself, people make it seem like palestinians are evil and put a disproportionte blame on them, whereas it was made clear at any peace deals, the right of israel to exist means denouncing palestinian civil rights, including but not limited to, the UN mandated right of return of refugees. jews have been living in palestine since forever, it's the separatism that is evil and violent.  gt; elected government interesting choice of words  gt; You brought up an ethnic cleansing to disproportionately blame Jews. honestly this is something i have always wondered myself. but growing up consuming western media, i find out that the west actually has been pro Israel to a fault, it's only after the rise of new historians that people started to look at palestinians with less disdain. i remember the days where people would just blindly say that palestinians don't exist, and jerusalem was just a barren land , while quoting mark twain. my motive of bringing up ethnic cleansing of palestinians is because people think nakba is a lie, and that the massacre did not happen, because to the person who wrote that, haven't they thought that palestinians just want to live and to exist too, and how is that possible, if they are still stateless and expelled?</TEXT>

Because it sounds like you're suggesting both. take the good, expel the bad  gt;Israel's existence isn't at their expense.  gt;Not the Palestinians themselves. Their corrupt governments, though, sure. There's a reason Arafat died with a net worth of ~1.3 billion USD. like i said, it's disproportionate. a self-aware person would admit that both israeli and palestinian politicians benefit by maintaining this limbo.  gt;UNGA resolution 194, like all UNGA resolutions, is non-binding. Palestinians are welcome to return to a future Palestine state when peace is actually negotiated. At most, you'll see a token amount of refugees allowed into Israel as has been discussed in past peace talks, as well as compensation. like i said, denouncement of UNROR is a prerequisite to peace deals and it grants legal immunity to israel.  gt;And there are non-Jews in Israel. ~25% of Israel isn't Jewish. i did not say anything in contrary to this.  gt;It may have been in the past, but it hasn't been like that in quite some time. it's still relatively recent, and this is only picked up in progressive circles now.  gt;it was Palestine was barren. and that's wrong. doesn't matter whether it's accurate or not. by that standard, a lot of countries we talk about today used to be barren too. the surge in population is quite recent in many places. propaganda relies on the aesthetics of untruth, like how trans people are mocked as serial killer transvestites or identifying as attack helicopters.  gt;I don't see people denying the Nakba today. well, not according to twitter, facebook, reddit, and quora and many more. unlike holocaust, it's still ok to deny the existence of palestinians, including in academia.  gt;They're stateless in large part due to their leadership, or lack their of. see, this dynamic of blaming the whole population because of their dysfunctional leadership, which in part was due to british fault, is a dehumanizing rhetoric. it literally ignores the assymetry of force and the disorganization of palestinian arabs in the face of systemic cleansing. it's a racist trope, like saying, a woman get raped because they dress provocatively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;A self-aware person would admit that Palestinian politicians benefit much more than Israeli politicians by maintaining the limbo. see, you keep accusing me of framing this between the evil Zionazi and palestinians, but in the end you're the one looking to be one-sided, definitely blame the palestinian side, a bunch of disorganized people with dysfunctional leadership. so who's projecting?  gt;It's a nonbinding resolution, there's no legality involved in it. are you purposely doing this. you keep threading like this means something. one of the biggest contention during oslo, and following deals, is the denouncement UNROR. but of course, blame palestinians for not wanting to be refugees forever. palestinians have been slighted by arab countries and israel, your promise has no weight in this discourse.  gt;Then what separatism are you referring to if not Jewish vs non-Jewish? creation of israel require ethnic cleansing and transferism to create a jewish majority. that's the separatism part. to separate israel from palestine.  gt;Define relatively recent then, because it hasn't been unconditionally pro-Israel for the last 20 years like i said, even to day, palestinian side is mostly only picked up in progressive circles  gt; It's not propaganda to point out that much of the land was empty. like i said, propaganda relies on the aesthetics of untruth, and therefore the idea of palestinians as a people used to be so shunned. likewise, centrists will say, writing serial killers as transgender is based on real stories and not transphobic, while the right are openly talking about how GRA reform should be repelled because of exactly that.  gt;Sorry, let me rephrase. I don't see anyone credible denying the Nakba today. even in american contemporary publication this is still very common.i remember studying IB history and some of the books literally sell the "spontaneous fleeing of palestinians".  gt;I literally blamed their corrupt leadership. that's a cop out. their situation should not be judged in isolation but as a whole, palestinian leadership might as well be non-existent ever since the days of BMP. it's about shifting the blames of systemic cleansing on dysfunctional, ad hoc leadership, which is a bad defense, because they were unprepared in the face of systemic and acute cleansing.  gt;The British were fighting alongside the Palestinians during the civil war, which occurred because of decades of violence between the 2 populations. i didn't say anything in contrary to that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Clearly you, because as I've stated multiple times I blame their leadership not the people themselves. i did not say that you blame an individual palestinian. just that you believe there's good israel and evil palestine in this.  gt;Of course it means something, there's no legal RoR. I have made no promise. No one expecting them to be refugees forever, their return would be to the future State of Palestine as I've mentioned previously, not to Israel. so don't blame them for rejecting peace deals?  gt;It literally didn't. that's what happened?  gt; It could be that the Palestinian National Identity is relatively recent, and the Palestinian previously referred to the Jewish population in the mandate rather than the Arab population. all national identities are relatively recent. nationalism is a modern construct. no one argue that part about the term palestinian. palestinians used to mean palestinians.  gt;There's no untruth to the land being sparely populated and mostly barren. the untruth is when people say that palestine was barren and palestinians are just arabs, and therefore, not real.  gt;And when were those books published? the US and the UK, i think.  gt;They started the civil war and had the British helping them. If you want to look at it as a whole, then you should probably include the decades of violence against Jews by local Arabs. What happened 80 years ago is hardly relevant to how their leadership acted and threw away opportunities 20 years ago. mehh you still believe the duality of good and evil, it seems. also you forget that the jewish forces also attacked British posts at the time. oppurtunities or diplomatic deals are just theatrics meant for external consumption, not unlike the latest trump deal, they aren't designed to be signed, sealed and delivered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Except that I never said this. This is something you keep trying to push on me. but you did, you keep blaming palestine as if the israel are not invested in maintaining the limbo because they need it as much? that's what I'm trying to drill into your head. and that's why there have never been a viable peace deal.  gt;I can blame them all day long. Their leadership doesn't ask for a full RoR into Israel because it's a non-starter. seems like you forget, that palestinian delegates have been asking for a diminished ROR because they are desperate.  gt;But it didn't have to. Early Zionists had every intention of living side by side with the Arab population until the decades of violence showed them that wouldn't work. um no outbreaks of violence is the fault of both sides, and there is an overwhelming assymetry on israel's side.  gt;Palestinian literally used to refer to the Jewish population in the Mandate. Do you think the Arab League was aiming to boycott the Arab population with their population of Palestinians goods? i don't wanna open another pandora box because i know how stubborn you are but look, you can either admit that palestinians exist, or you don't. and it seems like your right wing beliefs keep bleeding into this discourse so maybe try to be patient.  gt;That's a where not a when. my bad, they were published within the last 5 years.  gt;oppurtunities or diplomatic deals are just theatrics meant for external consumption, not unlike the latest trump deal, they aren't designed to be signed, sealed and delivered.  gt;So more strawman arguments. And yes, I'm aware that the Jewish militias attacked British posts, it was because the British closed off immigration to Jews. because that's part of why the british were at war against the jews too.  gt;Press [x] to doubt. you have to admit that trump deal is not viable, and camp david was botched at the last minute to smear palestinians. and it was supposed to go so well, until the final deal was nothing like discussed in dialogues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That's not them being desperate. That's them compromising. honey, they are compromising because they know they should, but ofc israel don't want no refugees.  gt;I didn't. Viable Peace Deals: Camp David Summit, Taba Summit, Olmert's Peace Plan. didn't they all denounce ROR and give legal immunity to jewish only settlements in palestinian territories, and many many other issues. and taba was stopped because likud won? Olmert is almost ok even though it still favours israel but israel is the occupier so that's expected but it was botched when israel refused to give the blueprint to Abbas, that aside it also has problems with ROR and settlements.  gt;Um no. Until the late 1930s, Jewish attacks on Arabs were retaliatory in nature. There's only asymmetry if you look just at the death counts. i was talking in the entirety of history. even before that attacks by arabs were done by irregulars. i know of the hostile state of palestine but there;s no reason for modern israelis to believe the second holocaust is coming for them.  gt;Except that I'm a leftist and have never once said that Palestinians didn't exist. welp. i mean i usually gonna mom the shit out of leftists but i guess i'm not gonna do that to you. so maybe just don't go repeating the talking point of palestinian deniers.  gt;Then those publishers badly need auditing. that's the thing, they are still new books.  gt;I said they were the ones that started it, because they did with ambushes on buses. i mean are we really going down this road now?  gt;Of course the Trump deal isn't viable. There could have been a chance, as unlikely as it is, that it would have gone better had Abbas not boycotted negotiations before they began. eh, you're blaming palestine again, jared kushner kinda made it clear he does not intend for peace. and trump was not subtle at all.  gt;How as Camp David botched to smear Palestinians? you know, the take it or leave it, denouncement of ROR, status of jerussalem, legal immunity, all that kind of shit, everything about it contradicts the middle grounds established by forefathers. at the time some jewish groups accused the deal as a theatrics meant to ambush palestinians.</TEXT>

I didn't mean to say that you're not straight or having ideas that are "not straight". like that should be obvious already? to be honest, at first I thought that you're an MGTOW who's concern trolling on a gay meme and "getting offended for me" just to attack me. but I tried to assume the best and put that aside. like i hope you can be reassured that I was not at all in doubt of your sexuality or your "ideas", and i have no reason to feel otherwise. having said that, this meme actually appeals to the LGBT friendly side and is circulated in lgbt subs, and therefore it should not carry over homophobic undertones even if there are any, so rest assured, it's ok.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>there are several books about it but i dont remember the title so maybe try google sorry. in roman society the accepted homosecuality is where the penetrator isa free citizen whereas the penetrated is a slave. athenian homosexuality took the form of pederastia which is basically just pedophilia. but things could be different in sparta where actual homosexuality between males of simar status was somewhat encouraged. https://mensvariety.com/gay-swallowing-roman-army/ this article is ott but it's partially true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>obviously pedophilia is older than history, the point here is that straight pedophilia is not the standard or socially accepted form of straight relationship, as opposed to pederastia. in fact iinm, roman society was at one point so disgusted by pedophilia that they outlawed it, because some parents actually pimped their children, and so more people turned to slaves. pederastia is not only pedophilia tho, it's a very distinct element of ancient Greece, so prolific that some scholars call it the defining element of the classical period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>reread my comment. i said that straight pedophilia is most likely older than history itself and it existed in in ancient greece too. i guess i have to rephrase my comments here. pederasty is not just pedophilia or gay relationship. it existed in parallel with straight relationship, ie. side hoes for men in straight marriage. pederasty by itself is a distinct Greek custom.</TEXT>

It's time for JKR's fans to confront JKR's views, it's sad seeing so many of her fans bending over backwards to justify her beliefs and actions, which are just indefensible. I have faith in younger generation. good luck and keep moderating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes technically that would be intersex, but sometimes they get assigned female at birth. um... it's a disingenuous comment. biology is not that clear. sex is, eventually, a collective of anatomical and physiological phenotype, a huge chunk of which is not immutable. equating sex with your chromosome is a lack of scientific understanding of basic genetics. so after going through transition, trans women are not "biological males" anymore, nor it is a term used by scientists. there's no such thing as chromosomal sex either, it's just sexual chromosomes. sex is just a phenotype, whereas your genes are a genotype. related but separate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;True, but to claim it was better for the community in Islamic countries before... is a lie, just is. i see, you have misunderstood me cause i have not said that at all. everything is worse in a lot of countries, including european countries where the UK, for instance used to hunt gays and subject them to castration. so that's not what i was saying. however, with proxy wars in the middle east and how the west is propping up dictatorships that export terrorism and fundamentalism around the world, their war positive rhetoric to liberate women and gay people in the middle east is just a self serving one, just for their own capitalist gains. and then when you factor in social media conservatives like Blair White calling for the hate for muslims while ignoring and downplaying local threats that can actually get you killed ( hello COVID 19, police brutality and BLM) kinda make you question their whole motives. I'm not saying that you can't say that Islam is homophobic, you can say that, make a placard, whatever, but please don't target and harass muslim gays about it, I've seen it happen all the time. you certainly don't need to remind them they are illegal in their countries. they know. so stop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Did you honestly just competed BLM covid and police brutality gurl relax. there's no competition. in case you don't know, an innocent and unarmed black man was tasered and shocked to death in broad daylight by a cop a few days ago. all I'm saying is that american republicans use foreign issues and xenophobia to distract people away from domestic problems and justify imperialism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so, now I'm ignorant for pointing out republican hypocrisy. and how am i belittling BLM? so people being killed in broad daylight is better than slavery? this post is about LGBT muslims , not Islam. and aren't you an Israeli btw? i think we have exchanged before?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>look, I have never been comparing which one is worse. you're the one making things up in your mind. like I said, middle eastern is problematic, but it doesn't justify xenophobia in the US, and ofc, imperialism. because i literally see people using that point all the time, not realizing that the wars only made it worse.</TEXT>
