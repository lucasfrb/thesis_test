    <TEXT>I can only talk for myself, but Im afraid of getting better because being like this is all i know. I feel like getting better is a good thing, but the process scares me, because i have to let go of bad coping mechanisms that i #8217;ve had as long as i can remember. Letting go of cutting, throwing up, eating disorder, etc is like letting go of a mother. Those things have always been there for me when i was alone, scared, and so on. So im afraid that if i let go, they will leave empty hole in me and i #8217;ll be alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the same way, im not addicted to cutting. Sometimes im even years without doing it. I cut when i feel like it, usually when i see no reason not to do so. I dont cut myself in dangerous places, not too deep, and self care is maybe the thing i love the most. And i can always stop myself from doing it if i need to. The urge to cut is kinda similar as when i feel like i want sugar or something. The urge usually comes if im very stressed, again similar to sugar cravings. I also dont count days or anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! Im on a retirement or something because of my mental health problems. My life was stable when i was single, had no friends, only people i saw were my therapist and family, but i felt like i had no meaning. I was sort of happy, i exercised a lot, ate well, had good structure on my days but still something was missing. But now im planning to start online classes, im in one group thing, im in a serious relationship and even have one friend who reached out to me and im so miserable i started self harming again. If im alone life feels meaningless, if im with people i feel like im dying. Im so sick of this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually the opposite. I have avpd and bpd, and it doesnt show outside. I always hear how nice i am. In school i was the happy, funny, friendly one. I have good  #8221;people skills #8221;, i can read people pretty well and so on. But it doesnt come like  #8221;naturally #8221;, for example i tell people about myself not when i feel like it, but when i feel like they want me to. And i dont comfort and hug crying friend because i feel i want to, but because i feel like that #8217;s what they want me to do. It #8217;s all an act when im with people, all my own opinions and needs disappear and i just exist for them.</TEXT>

I mean im very approachable (sadly) because that #8217;s a role i have been building for my whole life so if i have to be with people i can act like it #8217;s nice, but i still am very avoidant in a big picture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same! And my mask is so good people think i actually like being with people. Even people who know i have avpd have said how nice it was to see me enjoying being with people, even though i didnt enjoy it. So exhausting, and i dont know how to stop. It just automatically goes on when i see people. Personally i dont enjoy having friends. I dont want them, yet they always come from somewhere. They tell me how nice it is to be so close and im there not feeling anything, pretending like i too feel like they do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have almost the same situation actually. We #8217;ve been together like a year and he has seen my old self harm scars. i #8217;ve been clean for like two years and now i cut again. I dont plan on telling him, because im afraid how he will react. He reacts pretty strongly when im sad, he is more careful around me etc so i dont want him to know i cut myself. I think he know though, i cut small cuts on my legs and arms and say it #8217;s from shaving but i dont think he believes it. I still want to lie because people sometimes believe what they want to believe, so i hope he chooses to believe im telling the truth. I feel like it #8217;s not his problem or his battle, and telling him would only make both of us more stressed so.</TEXT>

I think it #8217;s weird that i usually always have someone in those as a father figure, but never a mom figure. And those  #8221;storyworlds #8221; were always where i went as a kid when i needed to be comforted, i never went to my real parents or like a friend. I still do it that way though. Sometimes it #8217;s just small scenes i do over and over, and sometimes whole stories i also do over and over a bit differently. Im also aware of my surroundings but still not really there. I work well on autopilotic.</TEXT>

But when im alone i know it #8217;s all just an act and i have no clue who i am or what i like. I dont have favorite foods or anything, my whole identity depends on who im with at that moment. When im alone im just kinda empty. I think it #8217;s the bpd part in me too that causes this.</TEXT>

But i have no clue who i am, it kinda changes when im with different people and when im alone im just empty or full of mostly negative feelings.

    <TEXT>Yes. Doesnt help that my ex always used to be a lot more nicer to me after he had abused me. And my current bf cheated me and i could tell because one day he was suddenly super nice. It #8217;s suspicious when people are nice, especially more nice than usually. I feel like if people are with you for long time, they take you for granted and only shame or guilt will make them appreciate you. So obviously i get excited when im being mistreated nowdays, it means there #8217;s a treat coming lol. Im still wondering what my friend did five years ago when she insisted she wanted to buy my meal when we were at a restaurant. Also randoms who say nice things - i cry after that, i feel like i lied to them and they think im good and nice even though im horrible and ugly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, and to me  #8221;im there for you #8221; means absolutely nothing. If i feel like i want to cut myself, talking to someone makes me want to do it more. There #8217;s nothing they can say to help. Absolutely nothing. No amount of empathy is going to make me feel better. I feel like i feel and people only make it worse, or are neutral to the situation.  #8221;Im there for you #8221; only means they have no clue about my situation, and i always end up faking like it helps so i dont make them feel bad. They have this fantasy about how im sick and if they give me nice words im supposed to be better. That #8217;s not how it goes, and eventually like you said they see it and dont bother to help anymore. They mean it in a good way so i dont want to hurt them by telling how it #8217;s not helpful. I honestly dont care if they understand, because that also doesnt help. Empathy and understanding only means they also feel bad, how is that supposed to help me with my feeling?</TEXT>

My ex lied to me that he was over me and he wasnt. It was very painful for him, and was not healthy for either of us. (We both have bpd.) Im sorry for your situation, and i understand letting go is one of the worst and hardest things there is, but in my experience staying friends with someone you still have feelings for is pretty much torture.

    <TEXT>For me doctors actually have told that at least meds that i #8217;ve taken, they #8217;re expected to make you worse for the first two weeks. Not for everyone, but for most people. So i agree, if you start meds take them long enough to see if they help and talk to your doctor about how you feel. I know it #8217;s frustrating, that #8217;s why i always wrote my diary so i could keep track of when i started the meds and how i #8217;ve felt, because if i have like two bad days in a row i go to the mood of  #8221;i #8217;ve been feeling this way my whole life #8221; and then i read my diary and see i actually was doing pretty okay two or three days ago lol.

After i see them i usually feel alone and sad, then guilt about not feeling like they do, then shame and anger. I usually cut, throw up, etc after seeing them to punish myself for not feeling  #8221;like i should #8221;, and get rid of the guilt and shame. Anyone else feel the same?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is, you cant really help her. She needs professional help. If she has that, good, if she doesnt, you should tell her to get it. You can indeed leave her alone if only reason for you to stay is because you want to help her or take care of her. You cant cure someone with bpd (or whatever it is they have) they need professional help. Always being there for them JUST because you want to save them can make them worse, if they choose you over actual help. So be her friend, if she wants to. But only if you are cabable having an actual friendship, not some parent-child or doctor-patient relationship because that #8217;s what it kinda sounds like you have / want to have.

    <TEXT>Sounds kinda same as what i do, but turned out my  #8221;everything is okay #8221; attitude is actually dissociation and depression. Like a constant autopilot. And it does feel a bit better, that #8217;s why i do it, only problem is when you recover from dissociation and depression the bpd waits there. And if you dont recover, life becomes meaningless, boring, and you dont know where you are. That #8217;s not better than bpd, it #8217;s just different torture.

    <TEXT>Yes. I #8217;ve had many personalities, and gotten inspiration from things like series and movies. Last time i had friends i had personality that was inspired by harley quinn and hannibal (the series), it was idk 7-10 years ago and it #8217;s funny when i see those people it still automatically goes on. Like i dont actually like red wine, but when im with them i do like it. I also was funny, happy, outgoing, and liked to see other people. But when i got bored to that personality, i also didnt see my friends anymore. With my ex i was kinda shy, childish, let him take care of me (because he liked it), and was afraid of people. Then when im alone im just like who the fuck am i. I feel like  #8221;reinventing #8221; myself is not good for recovering, but if i try to  #8221;find #8221; who i am im just.. idk empty? Im like a restaurant and i #8217;ll give people the personality they seem like they want to order. But i have a whole menu of them. If that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keep your boundaries. Do not bend them to avoid her getting mad. If you need to or you want to go to sleep even though she still wants to talk, you #8217;re allowed to. That #8217;s how it is in normal friendships. If she cant handle it, she has to talk to a therapist or someone about it, you should not have to walk on eggshells and fulfill her every need. That #8217;s not what friendships are for. And in my experience, when you break your boundaries constantly to fulfill someone elses (bottomless) needs, you end up treating yourself badly and it still wont  #8221;fix #8221; the other person. In my case i was walking on eggshells too, and every day i had to be more careful. It was kinda teaching him the wrong message too. But im sorry you #8217;re in that situation, i know it sucks.

    <TEXT>I understand it #8217;s hard. But you cant blame someone for not understanding, if you dont tell them. Sometimes people with bpd expect that our partners read our minds and fulfill our needs without us asking them, or telling them what to do. That #8217;s not actually how relationships work, that #8217;s how parent-child thing works. And your not a child, they are not your parent. I know it #8217;s hard, but if you dont talk to them about it, you cant expect them to understand. And if you dont tell how you feel, you also most likely will hold some grudge towards them that will sabotage your relationship. Is it possible that you #8217;ll tell them how you feel? And what it was that made you feel that way?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have bpd, and i dated someone with bpd. Maybe it #8217;s different if both have been in therapy, but i had been two years when we started dating and he was only diagnosed after we had dated three years. It was absolute hell, last year of our relationship i stayed because he had abused me and reminded me sometimes that if i even planned of leaving him he would kill me. I only left after he threatened to kill my family (especially said my 4 year old sister) and he was dumb enough to text me about it so i got screenshots and went to the police. But people are different, even with bpd, not everyone is abusive and some have their problems more in control than others. I think there are good and bad relationships, with people who both have bpd, one has bpd, or both are  #8221;healthy #8221;. It depends more about other things than just one diagnosis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah i #8217;ve been in that situation. First i was a gf, then also a mother, therapist, everything. When we broke up i stayed as a  #8221;friend #8221; because even though i was over him he still depended on me to be there for him. But i wasnt a friend, i was still a mother and a therapist for him. It #8217;s endless cycle where you think you help them, but it #8217;s actually how you get worse yourself and they stay the same. They need professional help, and you need to keep yourself safe. Many bpd patients are emotionally very hard even for professionals, so to us who have no actual training how to deal with them (or maybe i should say us, i have bpd too) and with the stress it causes, it #8217;s impossible.</TEXT>

I dont want to feel like he does anything for me, i want to be independent to the point where it #8217;s not probably healthy anymore. I think it #8217;s because if he leaves me, it will feel like i lose  #8221;less #8221;. He once bought me a coke and i always remember that when i buy coke, so if he is more involved in my life i #8217;ll never be able to get over him when he finally leaves.

He had abused me few times when we were together, and when we broke up if i didnt answer to his calls or texts immediatly, he started to threaten me with things like how he is going to kill himself now, or he is going to kill me, or the guy im seeing, etc. I ended it when he texted me he is going to kill my 4 year old sister and explained how he would do it. I was afraid to go home every night, because he sometimes waited in front of my building. My new bf pretty much helped me to go to the police, about threaths and one abuse (i had gone to the doctor after that time so they have evidence). I should have had ended things before it got to that point, but i felt like i wanted to be there for him.</TEXT>

If you feel like you dont need it, you #8217;re allowed to stop going. But if you have felt like you need help from outside, maybe this is normal frustration that is part of therapy, or wrong therapist? Couple months in therapy is very short time.

I #8217;ve always wanted to be alone as long as i can remember. I was friendly, happy, nice, good social skills, etc when in public, but it was a role because for some reason i though you have to be these things. I still struggle with people wanting to be friends with me, and old friends calling and texting me and telling me they want to see me. One of my ex friends broke up with her bf and told me she has no one else so i have to see her now. But i dont really want to. I have empathy for her but i hate myself when im with people.</TEXT>

But that #8217;s not really how it goes. Only a therapist can help with bpd. And her mother is there for her, so she is not alone. I have been in that situation, and i stayed. Worst decision of my life, made both of us worse. Tell her that you need your space, and that you would appreciate if she gave that to you. If she still texts you, say it again and after that dont answer. I know it feels rude, but it #8217;s actually her being rude if she #8217;s not accepting that you have a right to move on. I know you have empathy for her, but you still have to have empathy for yourself. You have a right to keep boundaries, and if that relationship is too much for you, you have a right to end it.</TEXT>

It was hell and every day i thank god i got out alive. We had good days too, but so does every abusive and toxic relationship. But i also have heard that some people have said that they #8217;re happily together and both have bpd. Probably depends on how much you can both control yourself, selfawarness, if therapy is helping, etc.</TEXT>

Like literally random people in comment section when i just mention i have it. Kinda ridiculous. When i told some of my friends they didnt really believe it i think, or at least it was suprise for them. Im not stereotypical bpd, i also have avpd and i keep everything inside and act like im fine, always happy and friendly. I dont keep it as a secret, i #8217;ve told about it for like random relatives, told my teachers when i still was in school, bf, some of his friends when it came up, etc, but usually most of them dont even know what it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I cut myself sometimes if im sad or numb, but also if i need to feel like im in control. And I use it as a grounding method when im dissociating, and i need to  #8221;come back #8221; quickly. I also reward myself with it when i have to see people i dont like. It #8217;s like a little secret that keeps me going trough the day, i get adrenaline rush for even thinking about it. I validate my feelings with it, and comfort myself. I like the feeling when i have  #8221;proof #8221; for my struggles. Like if i say someone im angry or sad, they can be like  #8221;yeah everyone is #8221;, but if i cut myself it #8217;s harder to ignore. (I never show my cuts or tell about them to anyone though). But it #8217;s really not helpful, and that #8217;s why i use more good coping mechanisms these days. I can clearly see how cutting at least in my experience just is digging the hole more deeper. Not helping me out of it. But still i get the urges sometimes.</TEXT>

When i was 20 and told my mom i was diagnosed with bpd, she pretty much yelled  #8221;bingo #8221; because it fits so well and explains my whole childhood and teenage years. My sister told me that it explains why i always did stuff like asked if she wants to play with bratz dolls, we happily go found our dolls etc, then 2 minutes and i say i dont feel like playing. She then asks why, and i get so mad, yell at her, and throw stuff and run out crying.</TEXT>

Nicest, friendliest, never in trouble, always did as adults told to, etc. I have  #8221;quiet #8221; bpd so they only saw my most radical mood swings, but it wasnt so obvious that something was wrong. It looked a lot like just normal defiance that kids and teens have. So they didnt have a reason to improve my behaviour, it was just that often when it was just our family i suddenly went from 0 to 100 and then wanted to be alone. Like withou a reason. I #8217;ve also had avpd traits as long as i can remember, so i never told mom if i had stomach pain or anything, i kept everything as a secret.</TEXT>

Now i #8217;ve dated another guy for like a year, and he cheated me with his ex. It probably wasnt the first or last time, but i still dont feel upset. I have this deep feeling that no matter who i date, they will hurt me in some way because im so disgusting and just bad in every way possible, that it would be ridiculous to expect people to love me and treat me well.

He also grow cannabis at my place, crashed my fathers car (i wasnt allowed to give it to anyone, but he told me he #8217;ll hit me if he cant take it) and stuff like that. Every week new theme.

    <TEXT>I know they did mistakes, but neither of them is (or was) unstable. Mom had depression like first two or three years of my life, and according to my therapist that can have a huge impact on a child. Neither of them used alcohol, and mom went to therapy when she was depressed, and it helped her. According to my psychotherapist (that i #8217;ve seen over 6 years), psychologist, doctors, etc, my parents are stable and  #8221;healthy #8221;, and my personality is very  #8221;needy #8221; (dont mean in rude way, but it #8217;s the truth) and i #8217;ve always been very sensitive, which is why moms depression (and traumas unrelated to my parents) made me this way. Im 25 and dont believe my parents are heroes. Still im aware that they have never been abusive and have been good parents. Not everyone with avpd or bpd has it because parents were abusive. That #8217;s a stereotype. (And out of the 6 kids they have, im the only one who is fucked up)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He started therapy before we broke up and i hope it helps and that he keeps going there, but yeah he was dangerous to others and to himself too and made me a lot worse while we were together. So in a nutshell my experience with people who have bpd too is that it #8217;s twice as hard when you #8217;re both struggling. But maybe when you #8217;re both in therapy and a lot better already, in theory it could be a good thing.</TEXT>

For example when my bf got caught cheating on me, i was very calm, told him it #8217;s okay, i forgave him, just wanted to move on and forget it, etc. It #8217;s because every time he mentiones his ex, or i hear or read her name somewhere, or he talks to another woman, etc, i already feel like he cheats on me. I get panic attacks in secret about the thought of him being in love with someone else, and me being disgusting and getting abandoned again. Im used to it. It literally feels as real as the actual cheating, but i know it isnt. I always control my anger, shame, all of bad feelings, and i dont know how to show it when there #8217;s actually reason to feel those things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah im afraid of that. But then i look back for example when i started going to therapy, and i can see how much i #8217;ve grown and healed. Even those things that i used to think i would never heal from have gotten a lot better, and it gives me hope that even though there #8217;s this feeling i #8217;ll never get better, it still is possible. It has helped me that i #8217;ve kept a diary, and when i read it like year or two after, i find things that i dont struggle with anymore. Like i used to throw up three times a week, and didnt eat almost anything. Had horrible stomach pain pretty much every day, and throwing up was very bad for my heart, throat, teeth, etc. Now i eat at least 3 times a day even if it #8217;s a difficult day, and sometimes i even eat 5 times, and i dont make myself throw up anymore. It felt impossible back then, and it #8217;s only a small victory, but still it #8217;s a great thing and i try to focus on finding those instead of focusing on my fears.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, it #8217;s literally part of depression that you may not want help because you dont believe it helps, you are too tired to do anything about things, you think you dont deserve it, etc. That  #8221;tell yourself your beautiful human being #8221; stuff is a step, but not first when it comes to depression. When you #8217;re deeply depressed your brain can be incabable to process things, your  #8221;logical #8221; and most developed brain system is not always  #8221;activated #8221;. First steps would be like get in therapy, sleep and eat well, for some people to start meds, stuff like that. Only after you are not in the deepest part of depression you can start changing your attitude to more positive and so on.</TEXT>

He says they never met, just sent pictures once. I saw the signs, but ignored them. He acted guilty, did the dishes, took the trash out, etc a lot. But i was like  #8221;haha my stupid imagination #8221;. So now im having those vibes again. Not that he #8217;s cheating, but that he lied about it. His ex had left a perfume at his place when they broke up, and now i cant find it at his place. It was there for like 6 months and was almost unused, so i started using it, that #8217;s why im sure he didnt throw it away. He said they didnt see each other, but i have a feeling they did and she either took the perfume or he gave it back to her. Asking would be most mature thing to do, problem is i have no way of knowing if he #8217;s telling the truth. If he shows it to me, or says he threw it away, or if i go looking it on my own, i feel like im batshit crazy. No matter what i do i feel like im overreacting because of BPD. What should i do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it #8217;s probably because someone cheating on me is exactly what i expect to happen, and in my last relationship i was physically abused so this feels like a step up. Problem is i #8217;ve never trusted him. I have no idea what it feels like to trust someone. Anyone. I only wanted to have sex with him like weekly, but he wanted to date. I feel confused when he cheated, because i #8217;ve always told we can have open relationship or even just have sex and nothing more, and it was him who wanted and still wants more. And this is more like me obsessing about wanting to know the whole truth and not so much if i can trust him. Because everyone lies, it just varies about what and how much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh okay. I think not everyone raises their voice when angry (at least not radically) so he could still feel anger just show it only as frustration and aggrivation. But anger is not useless, just depends what you do with it. It #8217;s usually a message that your needs are not met and stuff like that, so as a feeling it #8217;s a good thing, but when you let it out too radically it becomes a problem. But you shouldnt feel bad for feeling angry sometimes, in my experience it #8217;s a feeling that tries to protect you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I care about the truth so there wont be any suprises in the future. Like his ex telling me after years what actually happened or anything like that. I dont want anything waiting me in the future and biting me in the ass so to speak. Im getting good sex and nice time and that #8217;s honestly the best case scenario. There arent really  #8221;good and bad #8221; people out there, everyone is kinda gray and has their issues and hurts others. But yeah my mind is kinda conflicted because i want to find out, but not make him feel guilty again, he didnt eat well like in a month after so i dont want to remind him about it. Also dont want to feel like the im  #8221;crazy BPD bitch #8221; so maybe i #8217;ll just try to forget about it. Just dont know how.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would act like i already knew, but inside i would still feel like my world collapsed. I can forgive as long as i know exactly what im forgiving. Also one could argue that me caring about my bf feelings isnt purely that i care about him. I do, but main thing is that how he reacts effects me too, him spiraling into almost depression again because of guilt would be bad for me. He is nice to me every day and i benefit from our relationship, and that #8217;s why i am with him. Like i said, really cant ask more than that. And yeah i hope i #8217;ll find a way.</TEXT>

Also im a bit scared that im again dating someone who is undiagnosed person with BPD or that he has other mental health problems. He sometimes does very impulsive things that hurt him. This post was more about how should i act so that im not reacting like a psycho crazy bitch and not how dick he was but it seems like people focus on the wrong thing, maybe i wrote the post in an unclear way or something</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Im very aware, that #8217;s why i dont show any of my real emotions to people and i just show them what they want to see or what i think is  #8221;right #8221; to feel at that situation. 2. I had bad depression few years back, no idea how it was different. But now i sometimes have weeks when i get very high points in depression tests, then two weeks and im not depressed at all. I guess for me it comes and goes more easily than for someone that doesnt have BPD. 3. I had been making myself throw up like few months, and went to get help. Turned out my PDs had gotten me few other illnesses like severe depression, ptsd and eating disorder. Those had  #8221;signs #8221; so i knew i needed help, AvPD and BPD were suprises. 4. Yes but i also feel intense pain when i dont lose anyone. Like only seeing my family reminds me every time about how they #8217;re going to die and i #8217;ll lose them, so breaking up was a relief last time, one less person to worry about. When im not close with people, the pain of fearing abandonment is also not constantly there. Im relieved when relationship or friendship ends, and even when a person close to me dies. It means i cant fuck it up anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you do it and he takes the bait, would you break up with him? Or would it end up being another fight, hurting you more, and then still you would continue to be together? If he doesnt take the bite, would it really help you to get over what happened? If i was in that situation, i would probably end up making explanations like  #8221;he didnt take the bait because girl i pretended to be wasnt his type/ he is being loyal now but how long #8221; etc and wouldnt be satisfied doing it only once. I personally would not do it, because you can never truly find out if he will be loyal by testing and tricking him, and it would turn your relationship into playing games rather than trusting each other. But i also know how tempting it is and i too am tempted to play mindgames with people so i cant really judge. I just know from experience that it usually hurts me more than it helps, and yet i want to do it.</TEXT>

I feel a huge amount of empathy sometimes too. So then to balance this out i sometimes feel nothing. It gets boring and im kinda just empty, and empathy goes away just like all the other feelings. Usually happens when i #8217;ve felt too much for too long, and it #8217;s a way my mind tries to protect me from painful feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think my BPD is quiet type. However im not usually  #8221;quiet #8221; myself when im with people. I act like im happy, bubbly, energetic, have a lot of empathy, care about everyone, etc but in reality im just empty. I have no own feelings at that moment, i just mimic the feelings i think is  #8221;right #8221; to feel at that moment. Like if someone is sad, im comforting. Someone is happy, im happy too. This leads to all sorts of problems like when my ex abused me, he started crying after it. So naturally i saw the situation as  #8221;person sad - gt; i comfort #8221; and not  #8221;he hurt me - gt; run away #8221;. I #8217;ve been told that i have very good social skills, but im always afraid of being with people because it takes so much energy and im afraid i somehow fail. I also have AvPD. I dont only struggle showing my true emotions, but i dont even feel them when im with people. I feel like a mirror or something, who i am and how i act depends what i think the person / persons im with wants me to act. I dont enjoy being with people, but others enjoy being with me. I dont think no one really believes that i have BPD, because  #8221;quiet #8221; type is not the  #8221;stereotype #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course i cant know the whole situation, but based on the things you told, imo they #8217;re not toxic, and you #8217;re not asshole. I #8217;ve bad experiences of being  #8221;just friends #8221; with someone who had feelings for me. I too would not probably be able to be friends with someone if they told me they have feelings for me, because it can be very akward and i felt like i was giving them false hope. But you #8217;re of course allowed to not be in touch with them, and i even think it could be better that way. I mean if i get feelings for someone, it never really goes away and being just friends with someone you secretly have feelings or sort of small crush for is (again at least in my experience) kinda torture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never felt the need to hurt an animal, but i fantasised killing people a lot. I have AvPD and BPD (quiet type) and i seem like the nicest person you can meet probably. I was bullied as a kid, so when i went to next school i took the role of popular funny nice kid but i was still deeply afraid of people. So i was constantly afraid of everyone, when going to school, seeing friends, going to grocery store, using the bus, etc i was full adrenaline and just terrified and no one could tell. I couldnt avoid people, so thinking about killing them kinda made me feel a bit better and safer. Thoughts started maybe when i was 16. I also had plans how would i do it if i killed someone so it could look like an accident and so on, but i dont think i would ever had done it. Therapy helped with it quickly, they took me out from school, put me in temporary retirement (i still am on it after 6 years) and helped me to calm down. Turned out i was just constantly living trough my traumas when i was with people, and i also have ptsd so those thoughts were because i felt i was in danger and couldnt escape.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If i was talking to a guy i like and found out he has a lot of  #8221;other options #8221;, i probably would back off and let him play with those other women. Personally im not interested in people who play games, but i cant know what all women think so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends. If both have it, and you #8217;re in therapy and it #8217;s helping, then it could work. But i think you need to talk about boundaries. Healthy people should do it too but when someone has BPD it becomes more important, at least in my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can relate. I have quiet BPD and cant really relate to most people here, i never show my intense emotions, but i feel them and hurt myself to survive them. People telling they told someone to fuck off or  #8221;were so angry they just lost it #8221; seem so far away, like i get that angry too but im incapable of showing it outside at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me mindfullness helps. Im tired when i feel overwhelmed by life, emotions, people and so on. So my brain starts to shut itself down, sometimes to a point where i just start dissociate and im numb, dont really know where i am, everything feels foggy, cant focus on anything, etc. So grounding, breathing and calming exercises help me with being tired. At first it was frustrating when i started doing it, but with practice they now help a lot. I do them at least once a day, and 1-3 times in therapy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If im alone for a long time, i dont want to hurt myself anymore. And i start liking myself. Im more afraid of myself when im with people. The longer i am with them, the more angry, sad, hurt, etc i start to feel, and i just want to hurt myself after it. But usually i hurt myself only when im with people, i go to a toilet and used to throw up, now i just cut myself. I dont hurt myself if i know im all alone.</TEXT>

I had to wait a month, and during that i had like some random counsler who  #8221;kept me company #8221; because the waiting time was so long and they didnt want to leave me alone. If i had waited like two years there #8217;s a huge change i would have killed myself. Im so proud and amazed how you survived the wait even though it took so long! And im happy it finally is happening for you, i hope you #8217;ll start getting better!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like manipulation, and playing games etc. I would say women who are  #8221;healthy #8221;, confident, and stuff like that, will stay away from men who do that. You can  #8221;get girls #8221; by doing it but my guess is that the ones that are most interested have like abandonment issues or play games themselves. I would recommend not playing games, and maybe be careful with women who play games too. It #8217;s a red flag in men and women.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes and i agree you need to have some level of confidence. However in my experience women dont appreciate it if you approach them too aggressively, and being polite is never a bad thing. It #8217;s part of normal behavior to ask if you can come over. If he had sent multiple texts about if it #8217;s really okay and please can he, then i would agree, it can make a guy look a bit desperate. My friends arent  #8221;bunch of beta cucks #8221;, they #8217;re women.</TEXT>

You need to remember this, because if someone turns you down it doesnt mean you failed or are somehow  #8221;not good enough for girls #8221;, it just means the girl you approached wasnt good match for you.

I always notice how good his clothes look on him or how good he is at drawing and how cute he is when he just woke up etc but now i try to remember to say those out loud. At first when we started dating he was really akward when i complimented him (which was odd because he is never akward, it must have been because he wasnt used to compliments), but now he says  #8221;thanks #8221; or smiles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand you have your reasons to be overwhelmed and act like you do. However she doesnt know your reasons, so from her perspective you #8217;re a guy who once ghosted her and hurt her feelings, and now she gave you second chance and you seem like you play games with deleting messages and leaving her on read and playing with other girls and so on. If you #8217;re interested in her, or just want to fuck her, be honest with her. If you play games and keep sending mixed signals, you #8217;ll probably end up hurting her feelings again.</TEXT>
