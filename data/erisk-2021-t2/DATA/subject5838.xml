    <TITLE>Low job security for chemical engineers?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-18 02:31:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>hi, i #8217;m a junior in high school. i decided to take chemistry because i knew i wanted to be an engineer; i just wasn #8217;t sure which kind. over the year, i have learned to love chemistry. i #8217;ve been researching chemical engineering and i #8217;m beginning to get conflicting posts. many say it #8217;s worth it, but many also say it #8217;s not. so i was wondering if it #8217;s worth it? where do chemical engineers work? low job security? what do you do? i really want to help the environment and have been considering environmental engineering going down the chemical path.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>wow. that #8217;s really insane. I #8217;ve only had one  #8220;glitch #8221; in my life which wasn #8217;t nearly as important as what you #8217;re going through right now. you know your truth: you didn #8217;t go. however, if you feel that it #8217;s important that J.J. and his father make up so your child can interact with that side of the family, then I would personally lie and say you were wrong. have you ever considered asking A about the situation? does she remember going on the trip?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-20 21:11:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>i #8217;m not sure if this is the right place to go to, but i #8217;m going to share my story anyways. i #8217;m wondering if my mother experienced a glitch that was a  #8220;premonition #8221; to an event that happened 6 years later. my mother is the realest person i know. I #8217;ve gained a lot of respect and trust in her throughout the years, so i wouldn #8217;t consider her a liar. I #8217;ve always lived with my mother. in 2011, we moved to a small, one story house in a small town right next to the mississippi river. we #8217;ve always lived in this town, but my mom decided to get away and we moved to colorado for a year or two. i #8217;ll try my best to describe how the house looked since i don #8217;t know how to attach photos (don #8217;t think you can from here.) when you walk in through the front door, you #8217;re greeted with a small mud room with no door. stepping out of the entryway, you step into two living rooms. on the left, there was a couch situated in the farthest corner where my brother (S*) would sleep. on the right was the main living room. there was a couch and a loveseat on the side of the house where you stepped in and the TV was across the room. all the way on the right was my room. to the left of my room was the kitchen, and to the left of the kitchen was the bathroom and my moms room in a narrow hallway. there was a very obvious divide from the living room and kitchen, and at the time of this event there was a huge blanket dividing the house to preserve heat. at the end of the kitchen to the right was my sisters (M*) room and the basement. then there was the back porch, then the garage. my siblings and i were away for the weekend, so mother had the house all to herself. she hasn #8217;t ever been one to stay up later than 9pm, so she went to bed early. She suddenly wakes up to intense rapid banging on her door with what sounded like S* yelling  #8220;mom! fire! #8221; and then her door flung open and slammed against the wall. obviously she sat up very quickly and said,  #8220;what the fuck? #8221; the entire house was very dark and she was home alone. at the time, us children were very very young and she didn #8217;t want to scare us when we just moved into this house, so she never told us what happened until march 2017. it was around 2-3am when it happened. i woke up to my mom yelling. it sounded like she was very upset about something. i looked at my phone, put it back down, and decided to go back to sleep because i had school in several hours. mom just continued to yell so i decided to see what all the fuss was about. to me, it sounded like she was yelling  #8220;spider! #8221; and i wanted to see this damn spider. i walked out of my room and actually went into shock. all the lights were off, but there was an odd light illuminating from the ceiling. i was in shock staring at it when i think i hallucinated my mom through holes in the blanket diving the house yelling at me to get out. (she recalls not being in the house doing that. she says she made it outside when she realised i was the only one still inside) after i saw that, my mind went blank. i ran into my room in a desperate search for a coat and shoes, not even thinking of my glasses. i ended up finding slippers and a coat i still hate to this day. as i was running outside, S* was about to run inside to get me. he recalls running inside and getting me, though i remember running out of the house and seeing him run towards the front door. hours after the fire, my mom and S* begin to tell us all how the event rolled out. S* said he woke up to the sound of wood falling on the ground and thought our cat (she #8217;s still alive!) was on the table messing with things she wasn #8217;t supposed to. he got up and also noticed the glow from the ceiling and probably actual fire that i didn #8217;t see. he ran through the hallway where the most fire was (right next to my moms room!) and banged on her door and kicked the door in since it was locked. she was naked and only had a towel when she was outside. she eventually ran inside for her laptop and other devices, so i guess that #8217;s probably when i saw her. M* was also naked, but ran inside to get clothes and our cat that was shaking in fear in her room. I was the last one out and actually could have died from inhaling smoke. after we all discussed the event, mom began to tell us about her  #8220;premonition #8221; several years earlier. when she was alone, heard S* banging on her door, door kicked in, and nobody was there. I #8217;ve always thought it was paranormal because my mom and i have this connection that no one else in the family has. she said she had a dream where we were both supposed to die, but obviously that was just a dream. i feel like i was supposed to die. i #8217;m very thankful everyone made it out okay. but now i #8217;m beginning to think it could #8217;ve possibly been a glitch? my theory is that maybe the universe glitched or some shit and showed her something that was going to happen in several years. it sounds weird, but i #8217;m trying to broaden the way i think. so what do you guys think? please let me know</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my house fire. so several years back, when we first moved into that house, my mom had unpacked a few things for the night and crashed. she says my little brother and i were at our fathers, my sister (M) was at her grandmas and my older brother (S) was living with our grandpa. she closes the door, turns on the fan, shuts off the light, and heads to bed. hours later, she's woken up by frantic banging on her door and a voice that sounds like it's saying "mom!" and then the door fucking swings open. she sits up and says "what the fuck?" but nobody is there. fast forward to about six years later. its 2am and everyone is asleep except for S. he hears what sounded like wood being knocked over in the kitchen and thought it was our cat. he actually got up to check it out and yep. he noticed a light coming from the attic and the closet in flames. he runs over to my moms room and bangs frantically on it, calling her name and screaming that there's a fire. he kicked the door down and the same thing played out. she sat up saying "what the fuck?" and eventually busted it out of there. she told us about her experiencing the same thing several years ago a few hours after the fire was put out. i of course 100% believe her. we were all very traumatized and grieving for the things we lost in that house so i have no idea why she would just make that up. she suffered the worst from the whole ordeal and still wakes up from dreams thinking the house is on fire. she said she didn't tell us about it because we were so young when it happened that she didn't want to scare us. we rented a house that i like to call "the green house." a lot of spooky shit happened there, but i think the cherry on top was when i felt afraid and wanted to sleep in my moms room. we both watched her phone slowly fall off of a flat surface. i can talk about so much more but i'll cut it short here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it has been bugging the hell out of me that nobody told steven why connie reacted the way she did. they could've said "marriage is what happens after you DATE them and you're too young" or something along those lines. aaaaagh! hope it happens in the next episode</TEXT>

    <TEXT>alright i'll let you in on the one in my current house. my mom used to have a boyfriend a few years ago who is now gone. she hated him but for some reason wouldnt leave him. anyways, she's pretty sensitive to the paranormal. we did the ouija board together but she would do it alone sometimes. she told me how she basically asked this spirit who actually calls itself a demon to haunt his (K) dreams. so then it's the next day and she tells me later that night that K had a pretty fucked up dream about her and feeling an evil presence. i've got the video somewhere, i'll try to link it. so yes she recorded it and in the middle of the video, you can see an invisible entity pushing the phone off the fucking table. K had no idea she was recording so he didn't move it and you can hear my mom get irritated about it falling off the table. it was just the wildest thing ever</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so weed affects everyone differently, but i #8217;m pretty sure that this is an everyone type of thing. marijuana doesn #8217;t impair you like alcohol does. when you #8217;re high on marijuana, you #8217;re pretty much still you, if not a little goofier. now there are people who get REALLY anxious and paranoid while high, and she is definitely one of them!!! she should NOT be smoking because it #8217;s obvious that it just makes her paranoid and agitated for no reason. she seems to have mental problems that don #8217;t combine with marijuana. she would probably flip out of you if you told her to stop smoking, but i think you should advise her to stop or simply just leave because she sounds crazy. i used to be very accusing myself and offended when my boyfriend wasn #8217;t  #8220;enthusiastic #8221; enough, and i was also smoking weed at the time. we both stopped smoking around two months ago and i have to say that i feel really refreshed and levelheaded! I realised how crazy i was acting and want only to give my man the world. perhaps she will be the same, but if she rejects the idea, then i think you should get rid of her. marijuana can really fuck with people who have mental problems like paranoia and anxiety. they just don #8217;t mix</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ah thank you a lot for responding! i #8217;m currently doing the odin project where they teach anyone how to make websites. my boyfriend is very experienced when it comes to languages, such as javascript and c++, because he #8217;s being using it forever.. and he #8217;s only 19. the point is that sometimes i watch him work and he thinks aloud, especially when he comes across errors. i watch him go through the lines of code he #8217;s made to find the problem and he usually always resolves it quickly. the odin project encourages you to look for the error before googling. if you can #8217;t find what #8217;s wrong, then google it. after we #8217;ve been through every option and still can #8217;t find the answer, THEN it #8217;s time to ask someone for help. so far this course has helped me to problem solve a little better... even though i haven #8217;t even gotten into the languages yet haha. but with your other point: i actually have signed up for a free online course in logic. i #8217;m not sure it #8217;ll really help towards thinking like a programmer.. but i #8217;m thinking it will help me out in the long run. i made sure to read good and bad reviews before signing up and decided to go through with it. i hope you get back to me on if this is a bad idea or not..? with what you said before: i do want to know HOW to apply things to real life. I #8217;ve always ALWAYS had problems with story problems in math and maybe this can help me out a little?  #8220;This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth. #8221; this is directly from the course overview. as i said before, just let me know if it sounds like it will help me any.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>just to explain some things: she claims i got the rats. i didn #8217;t. her friend had a rat that gave birth and my sister asked me if i wanted some rats. i said i didn #8217;t know since i just had guinea pigs and didn #8217;t want anymore rodents, but she brought them to me anyways and forced them upon me. i took care of them until i couldn #8217;t anymore and she said she would take them in without a problem. it #8217;s funny because her husband said  #8220;at least we take care of our animals #8221; and here they are NOT doing that. this whole thing is ironic and my sister shouldn #8217;t be allowed to have any more pets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my boyfriend doesn #8217;t want to be an organ donor because of this situation we heard about. basically two old people got in a motorcycle accident and died. one was an organ donor, and they had to keep her on life support for three days to harvest her organs. her husband had died the day of the accident and she was kept alive for three extra empty days for her organs to be harvested. it truly does sound like hell #8212;being trapped in your dead mind and body for three days before finally being able to let go. i #8217;m still going to register to be an organ donor, but that thought still creeps me out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to get an older pair of budgies to bond with you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 22:44:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all! My boyfriend was gifted 2 budgies around 4 years ago. He actively tried to befriend them for over a year, but they never budged. He decided that they just like being in their cage and don #8217;t like him a whole lot. It #8217;s kind of sad, but the budgies genuinely are very happy in their cage. Unfortunately, IM not happy that they won #8217;t come out. To make it clear, they #8217;re comfortable with him changing their food and water and receiving millet by hand. Sometimes we will be lucky enough that they hop on our fingers. Since it #8217;s been so long, i #8217;m not sure how to go about bonding with them. Does anyone have any advice? If you need any more information I will certainly be willing to explain further about the whole situation</TEXT>

    <TEXT>!explanation we were discussing how her boyfriends cat had been left alone to fend for itself for 5 days with no food and water. (just to be totally clear, i had no idea that this was going on and flipped out) her boyfriend recently moved in with us and apparently his son was supposed to take the cat. that cat is now in my room as we speak. it then occurred to me that he had two cats the last time i went over to his house. i inquired my mom about it and... the photo explains the rest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes i think she was being spiteful and not serious. people are taking this quite literally and i can understand why. what she said is not cool or funny in any way. it upset me extremely and it #8217;s upsetting people just as much. but i don #8217;t think she was being sincere, no. she wouldn #8217;t crush a kitten.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i #8217;m not trying to make up excuses for her. i get that it probably looks that way, but i #8217;m not. she has some serious issues that she doesn #8217;t want to/can #8217;t face because we can #8217;t afford it. what she said and did is completely inexcusable. i love her and all but she definitely can be insane at times due to her uncontrolled emotions</TEXT>
