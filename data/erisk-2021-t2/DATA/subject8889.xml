    <TEXT>If things doesn't work out for you, why not go to a community college, take those required gen eds, etc and transferring those credits back here? Not only will the tuition over at a CC be inexpensive, those courses will be relatively 'easier' than at Bing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Newly-admitted transfer Student looking to skip a semester</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-17 16:10:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've decided to skip my first semester (Fall 2018) here at Binghamton as a transfer student due to personal issues I'm having at home and planning to start in Spring 2019. I've spoke with one of the Watson advisors and she said I can fill out a deferral, but that is for one year. Are there any other options besides that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a transfer student from Queensborough CC and was accepted into Watson this semester with an 3.8. Just have your GPA to atleast a 3.5 and you should be good. You should keep in mind that different departments have different set of requirements (GPA, prerequisites, etc).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ASU, UConn, Queens College (lol) aren't worth attending. I'd choose NYU or maybe Fordham If and only if you and your parents can afford it. Bing and Stony is about the same in academics but their social aspects differs greatly. As you know, Stony is a commuter school that empties on the weekends while Bing is known to have a better dorm/campus life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only school worth the extra $$$ in your list is NYU. I wouldn't pay extra to go to Fordham, and because I don't know much about that school anyway. I would say Bing is the best 'bang for your buck' type of school.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I transferred from Binghamton as a Computer Engineering Major to do the pre-engineering program at QC. From what I can tell, Binghamton's CS is pretty good and competitive to transfer into (their CS department accepts a single digit number per year from transfers so that their student body can stay small.) This means more individual attention to the students and a collaborative environment. Job prospects wise is good too (IBM, Bloomberg, etc. regularly attends Bing's career fair every semester).</TEXT>
