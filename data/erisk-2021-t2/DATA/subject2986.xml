    <TEXT>The range isn't THAT bad if I were shooting at you with it and you just jumped backwards I could still hit you jump back twice and maybe not but that's the thing with this weapon the key to using it is being good at maneuvering through the ink and around bullets or other attacks to get to right up on opponents and quickly kill them with the high damage the weapon does at close range. so you may try to jump backwards but by the time you're feet touch the ground I'm either behind you or right back in front of you from swimming in the ink .in which I'm most likely going to win in that fight because of the high damage I will do at close range. At least that's how i use it</TEXT>

And I know you are going to say something like WeLl YoUr TeAm CaRrIeD yOu but in most ranked matches I'm 1st for kills unless there's a sniper on my team and in turf war I do good to decent in both kills and ink coverage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was in kindergarten there was this kid who would always mess with me but I didn't really care until one day I brought a book about cars that my mother had just bought for me as a birthday present because I loved cars to school. and when it was time for recess I brought it with me and looked at it for a little bit but then decided I wanted to go on the swings so I went to my teacher who was sitting at a picnic table near the playground and asked her to watch my book until recess was over. so she took my book and I went to go play on the swings but then I looked over and saw the same stupid kid who would always bully me pick up my book at the table which my teacher was no longer sitting at (she had gone inside for some reason). so I got up and started running towards the kid to get my book but before I could get to him he just started tearing apart my book for no reason I kept running at him saying stop that's mine then he turns around and simply says no it's not then throws what's left of my book on the ground and runs away. then I started crying while trying to pick up all the pieces of my book off the ground 3 minutes later my teacher came back outside and saw me crying and asked what was wrong so I told her what happened and she brought me inside and lazily tried to put my book back together with scotch tape. then I went home and had to tell my mother what happened and it made her cry when I showed her the book it felt horrible to see my mother cry and I felt like it was my fault because I didn't keep the book safe. then about 7 years later I was riding my bike down the road and I saw the kid who had torn my book apart walking down the street so I stopped my bike and just stared at him and had never felt such anger in my life my hands clinched the handle bars of my bike so hard my skin started to burn. luckily he had his head to the ground so I don't think he noticed me starring at him then after he had kept walking and was far out of sight I still just stood there in the same spot on the side of the road still so angry that I didn't want to move. then I started biting my nails out of stress and stood there biting my nails for about 20 minutes before I felt a stinging pain in my left index finger then looked down and noticed that I had bitten off a huge part of my nail and it was bleeding pretty bad. so I rode home on my bike and washed my bloody hand off and put a bandage on it then found the taped together book that I kept and just looked through it while I cried thinking about that moment again and how it felt when it made my mother cry. And still to this day that memory sometimes randomly pops up in my mind and I get so angry that I can't think or do anything it's like a curse that probably haunt me forever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And Ryan Whitaker a white man was shot dead by a cop while playing crash bandicoot with his kids but none of the major news networks covered that story did they there wasn't any riots or protests when he was killed was there. Justine Damond an innocent white woman was shot and killed by Mohamed Noor a black police officer and none of the big major news networks covered that story either. That's what the media does it pushes stuff like this under the radar and the second the same thing happens to a black person they report the hell out of it and make sure that as many people hear about it as possible to make it seem like this kind of thing only happens to black people when that simply isn't true. People wrongly getting hurt or killed by the police is a thing that happens sadly to ALL kinds of people not just black people it has nothing to do with race All lives matter including black lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It make me angry that people in countries like here in the U.S will find the smallest little things to complain about. Meanwhile in places like you said Zimbabwe people are having their entire livelihoods stripped away from them. People just don't realize how good we have it here Anyway I wish you and your friend the best of luck in the future.</TEXT>
