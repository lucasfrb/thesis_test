    <TITLE>Misandry: on acknowledging anti male sexism.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-04 19:21:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>In a post on twitter about a clip from the tv show Friends making fun of domestic violence against men. *(the man said "She threw things. They hit me" and the reaction of the audiance waq laughing)* a woman commented:  #8203;  gt;I think this **joke was based on a view that women being mad shouldn't be taken seriously**; like a child throwing a tantrum and objects, as if that's cute or something. On the other hand, I can see it as a poor taste in humor using domestic violence. Male victims of domestic violence are mocked, wich is sexism against men. but she framed the situation as sexism against women. It's like someone saying making fun of violence against gays is acctually bigotry against heterosexuals. This reminded me of this part from MEETING THE ENEMY A feminist comes to terms with the Men's Rights movement talk by Cassie Jaye (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY amp;t=153s amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks)) \[ 6:46 ; 7:26\]  #8203;  gt;I changed from making words in their mouths, to acknowledging the issues, but insisting they are women's issues.A men's rights activist would say to me "a man is far more likely to lose their child in custody battle" and i would counter "because women are unfairly expected to be the caretaker, it's discrimination against women that women get custody more often" Another example is when talking about forced conscription of men during world wars as an example of systemic sexism against men, people say "women were not allowed to be in the army" ! As if it's a privilege to be forced to die. as if the victims here is women not men. Why this happen ? For decades gender studies focused exclusively on women's rights but never **men's rights**, exclusively on misogyny but never **misandry**. people don't even know the word misandry. Our brains are biased, we interpret any sexist double standard as sexism against women, even sexism against men is considered sexism against women. # Acknowledging anti male sexism and female privilege: Mocking male victims of domestic violence is sexism against men, giving women the custody of the children just because she is a woman is sexism against men, forcing to die in war is sexism against men. In a lot of areas women are privileged. sexism against men is real. **female privilege** is real.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Misogyny Hate Crime: How the Trick is Performed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 08:34:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>The situation in the UK is getting worse ! Feminists are making new laws that will make anything a hate crime ! any criminal act against women and girls (and only women and girls) by a man or a boy (and only a man or a boy) will be considered a hate crime !!  #8203;  gt;How did North Yorkshire define misogyny hate crime? By definition it can be committed only by a man or a boy, and the victim can only be a woman or a girl. **The** ** #8220;offence #8221; is any male person doing the following to any female person**, :  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;\- unwanted or uninvited sexual advances;  gt;  gt;\- physical or verbal assault;  gt;  gt;\- unwanted or uninvited physical or verbal contact or engagement;  gt;  gt;\- sexually graphic and explicit obscene language;  gt;  gt;\- use of mobile devices to send unwanted or uninvited messages or take photographs without consent.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt; #8220;Uninvited verbal contact #8221; means a man is not permitted to speak to a woman until spoken to. As for uninvited electronic messages, that applies to virtually every email or text you ever receive. Read the full article [here](http://empathygap.uk/?p=3529).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-05 14:28:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not only men and boys are victims of systemic discrimination in education and hiring and now started "camps" to demoralize them ! This investigation is a must read (link [here](https://thepostmillennial.com/federal-government-sends-employees-from-top-us-nuclear-lab-to-insane-reeducation-camp-for-white-privilege)):  #8203;  gt; Last year, Sandia National Laboratories #8212;which designs America's nuclear weapons #8212;**sent its white male executives** to the La Posada luxury resort to undergo a mandatory training called "White Men's Caucus on Eliminating Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia in Organizations."  gt;According to documents, the white men were instructed to make a list of things that are part of **white, male culture**. A board reveals the words " MAGA Hat," "KKK," "Aryan Nation," "**mass killings**," "no rhythm," "power," among others. What is the difference between this and the way Donald Trump talk about mexicans ! or the way David Duke talk about jews !  #8203;  gt; Finally, as the reeducation camp concludes, the white males must write letters "directed to white women, people of color, and other groups regarding the meaning of this Caucus experience." They apologize for their "privilege" and pledge to become "**better \[allies\]**." They want to turn men from independent human being to "allies" of women. In short the role of men in this life is to serve women ! to improve the life of women and girls at the expense men and boys !  gt;In the leaked letters, the white men appear to be appropriately shamed. "**I'm sorry** for the time I have not stood up for you to create a safe place," one letter reads. "**I'm sorry** for the time I've spent not thinking about you..." End.</TEXT>

As if it's a privilege to be forced to die. as if the victims here is women not men.  gt;There is such a lack of respect for women that stems from this view, that women are somehow so much more incompetent than men, in any given situation, and it holds back equality so much. I disagree, i think there is such a **lack of respect for men** that stems from this view, that men are somehow so much more evil than women, in any given situation, and it holds back any conversation on men's issues and men's rights.</TEXT>

Male employers, senior managers, middle managers, supervisor and peers bullied men and women about equally, whereas **women bullied women far more than they bullied men**. The largest group of bullies of women were female peers, who rarely bullied male peers, while male peers bullied both genders about equally. **Female clients bullied female staff but almost never male staff**; male clients bullied both men and women but the numbers were small.

I would say that there is a good probability that the number of men bullied by women is actually greater than reported. Oh yes, good remark.  gt;This paper is pretty much everything wrong with modern social sciences. But even their own study proved that there is no "gendered nature of power", women are more abused by other women. other studies on online sexism also proved that the majority of those who use terms like "slut" and "whore" are women (60%)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>" men don #8217;t want to talk about them " another victim blaming !!  #8203; Not because any conversation on men's rights is considered hate speech ??  #8203; In 2015, the University of York announced its intention to observe International Men #8217;s Day (on men's health) A torrent of criticism ensued, including an open letter to the university claiming that such a day  #8220;does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed, inequalities #8221;. The university cancelled the plans and affirmed that  #8220;the main focus of gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by women #8221;. In contrast, its observation of International Women #8217;s day a few months earlier was a week long affair with more than 100 events. A [proposal](https://archive.is/ije1c) at Simon Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a men #8217;s centre on campus (to address issues like suicide, addiction, and negative stereotypes) was opposed by the existing women #8217;s centre. Their alternative suggestion was a  #8220;male allies project #8221; to  #8220;bring self-identified men together to talk about masculinity and its harmful effects #8221;. Author Warren Farrell went to give a talk on the boys #8217; crisis (boys dropping out of school and committing suicide at higher rates) at the University of Toronto, but he was [opposed](http://archive.is/gDvn0) by protesters who  #8220;barricaded the doors, harassed attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at speakers and more #8221;. Opposition included leaders in the [student union](https://archive.is/9zVr0). Three students at Ryerson University (also in Toronto) tried to start a men #8217;s issues club. They were blocked by the student union, which associated the idea with #160;supposed  #8220;anti-women #8217;s rights groups #8221; and dismissed the idea of sexism against men as an  #8220;[oppressive concept](https://archive.is/Jlac1) #8221;. The union passed a motion saying it rejects #160; #8220;Groups, meetings events or initiatives \[that\] negate the need to centre women #8217;s voices in the struggle for gender equity #8221;. Professor #160;Janice Fiamengo tried to give a talk in Ottawa on men #8217;s issues, only to be [interrupted](https://archive.is/TfVwd) by students #160;shouting, blasting horns, and pulling the fire alarm. Christian Hoff Sommers (known for her conservative/individualist/libertarian [perspective](https://archive.is/IGkLt) on gender issues) gave a talk at Oberlin College in Ohio. Activists hung up [posters](https://archive.is/IGkLt) identifying #160;the names of those who invited her as  #8220;supporters of rape culture #8221;. A student at Durham University in England was affected by the suicide of a close male friend, and so he tried to open up a  #8220;male human rights society #8221; on campus. His proposal was [rejected](https://archive.is/XxPC6) by the Societies Committee as  #8220;controversial #8221;, and he was told he could only have a men #8217;s group as a branch of the Feminist Society on campus. Journalist Cathy Young spoke at Saint Paul University (part of the University of Ottawa) in September 2015, on the topics of campus gender politics, GamerGate, neglect of men #8217;s issues, and focusing on women #8217;s victimization (for sexual violence and cyber-bullying). [Masked protesters](https://archive.is/gCjJg) called her  #8220;rape apologist scum #8221; and pulled the fire alarm.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The term "femicide" is a insult for all men and strip them from their humanity.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-07 19:02:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Femicide is the murder of a woman. we have the term homicide why inventing a new term ? feminists say "femicide" is not normal murder. it is the murder of a woman "just because she is a woman" (hate crime) If you see the cases they give as femicide you will see mostly murder by intimate partner (now they started to include all murder) ! the reason of the murder is an argument or cheating etc etc ... the partner already know she is a woman ! saying she was killed "just because she is a woman" is simply a lie. femicide is a myth created to fuel the victim mentality. just like they do in college. 62% are female. therefore they only focus on STEM to keep the "women are oppressed" narrative going. Men are 3x more likely to be victims of homicide, the feminists who invented the term and the people who use it simply don't see the life of men worth as much as the life of women (male disposability/female supremacy)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\- When you ignore the fact that work in the past demanded physical strength (in the year 1400 71% of the people in france for [example](https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture) worked in agriculture, 60% in Italy, 57% in England.), infant mortality was very high and other natural factors created gender roles and you blame it on "male domination" as if working in agriculture or coal mine is a privilege ! \- When you ignore all the studies that prove the symmetry in domestic violence and insist that only men are abusers and only women are victims and you pass a bill titled "Violence Against Women Act" \- When you use studies on sexual abuse that consider male rape by women as non-rape to prove that sexual is something only men do and all men are to blame like the feminist author Susan Brownmiller said in her book Against Our Will: "Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which **all men** keep all women in a state of fear. " \- When all gender studies focus exclusively on women's rights but never men's rights, when you focus exclusively on the oppression of women ignore the present and historical oppression of men like being forced to go to war, being second class victim in anti traficking treaty, being mocked for being victim of domestic violence or rape by women, being the majority of the homeless...  #8203; When you explain the past and the present by "men as class" oppress "women as a class" of course the result will be hashtag "men are arash". you see that Iranian men who oppose the regime and forced headscarf ? he is part of the "oppresser class". and you see that Iranian women who insult other women who don't wear head scarf calling them "sluts" ? she is part of the "oppressed class" ! according to the patriarchy theory men are oppressors. regardless of what they do or don't do. Hashtag "men are trash" is a direct result of feminism. the patriarchy theory present men exactly how the nazis presented jews : parasites who exploit and dominate others. **The patriarchy theory is not just false, but hateful.**  #8203; " So one of my core themes in The Myth of Male Power #8212;that **history #8217;s controlling force was not patriarchy, but survival** #8212;is still ignored. Instead, the leading universities #8217; women #8217;s studies and  #8220;gender studies #8221; courses still emanate from the Marxist and Civil Rights model of oppressor vs. oppressed. We #8217;ll see in this book exactly why the dichotomy of oppressor/oppressed is both inaccurate and, more important, undermines love and women #8217;s empowerment. In virtually every leading university this **leads to a demonizing of men and masculinity** that distorts the very essence of traditional masculinity #8212;being socialized to be a hero by being willing to sacrifice oneself in war or in work. The possibility that being socialized to be disposable is not genuine power is, to this day, either considered radical, heretical, or, most frequently, not considered.

Gender roles didn't exist to "control woman's reproductive status" but because one men can impregnate multiple women. that's why male disposability existed too. the goal is survival.

    <TEXT> gt;Conscription is a form of oppression.. by other men. Oppression is oppression. being oppressed by other men or by women is irrelevant. your comment is like the white supremacist who talk about "black on black crime"  gt;In every class, men's social status was superior to women's social status. In many societies, women's properties were owned by her husband, she cannot go outside without her husband's permission. A woman's social status was defined by the men in her life (father or husband). There are obviously many more things that benefited men in a patriarchy. You are doing exactly what i said in the post. you focus exclusively on areas where women are disadvantaged and ignore areas where men are disadvantaged to prove somehow women are oppressed. Apparently you don't care about gender equality you only care about women's rights. You focus on social status and ignore protection. Men had the social and legal obligation to provide for women and this still exist until today. in my country Algeria the daughter has a right to maintenance from her father even if she has 45 years old. Men were and still considered disposable. "women and children" first ... There are obviously many more things that benefited women in a so called "patriarchy"</TEXT>

Feminists created "Violence Against Women Act" in the US ! in the UK "Refuge" the bigest anti domestic violence feminist org said domestic violence is gendered issue and urged the government to not write gender neutral law (to discriminate against men) But what about men's rights advocates ? are they the same like you say ? no. visit any MRA website they say that domestic violence affect both men and women.  gt;TL;DR: If feminism is gynocentric, then so is mens rights.

    <TEXT>They can't fix the biases if they are also biased themselves. like i said most politicians are men. Barack Obama is a man. his health care bill mention breast 40 times but mention prostate 00 time !! it's not about the gender it's about the ideas. We need to change minds and educate people on men's issues (both men and women)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the feminists who protest to shut down MRA conferences not the other way around. Be honest, blaming all sides won't fix the issue. blame the guilty only (feminists). It's the women's center who opposed the creation of men's center. the problem is feminism not MRA. I never hear MRA say women are trash, but i always see feminists hear feminists say men are trash. How can we find common ground with feminists who think that domestic violence only affect women ?! MRA are against identity politics. Common ground is equality. feminists reject that.</TEXT>

Only a ban on  #8220;men have it worse #8221; but not  #8220;women have it worse #8221; UNmen is a place for men to learn how to help empower the women and children in this world. ! but with already have UNwomen for that. what about a place for women helping empowering men and children ?  #8203; Men are only 38% in college. Men get 63% more prison time for the same crime. The family courts are biased against men. Men are the majority of the homeless. Men are the majority of the suicide victims. Only female genital mutilation is banned but not male genital mutilation. Men victims of domestic violence are ignored.  #8203; Etc etc .. feminism want us to just ignore all that and focus only on women's rights. this is Gynocentrism: a dominant or exclusive focus on women in theory or practice; or to the advocacy of this. Anything can be considered gynocentric when it is concerned exclusively with a female point of view. women are considered the center of the universe and men are striped from their humanity. And i was banned just for posting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egalitarianism/comments/j8tj8d/kqeds_forum_sean_kullman_founder_of_global/) video about the education of boys.

The author is a president of gender studies department. she is not only a feminist. but her job is teaching feminism. Feminism is a hate movement. the "toxic masculinity" mean that masculinity is toxic. why would you associate toxicty with masculinity in the first place ? because as a feminist you think only men and boys commit toxic behavior. = you think being born male is something wrong. I'm an ex feminist. feminism is trash. egalitarianism is better. feminism is a hate movement against men and boys. No, i don't "feel" attacked . i'm attacked. you can't attack my identity (masculinity) and then claim that i just feel attacked !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, patriarchal value mean men are considered superior and women are inferior. but for example in case of domestic violence only female victims are protected under governments programs ! which means men are discriminated against. When you say "patriarchy" it means only women have issues and not men. No, women are not oppressed. this model of "oppressed VS oppressor" is false and bigoted against men. because that theory make men's issues invisible and a taboo in the society. Women and girls have problems and issues AND men and boys have problems and issues. Male genital mutilation is even more widspread. honor killing affect men too. a lot of hindu men killed by the women's muslim family and a lot of muslim men killed by the women's hindu family. honor killing is not a women's issues. Study found 78 honor killing in Germany from 1996 to 2005. Of the persons killed, **43% were male**: read [here](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/shameful-anti-male-bigotry-in-the-study-of-honor-based-killings/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes it is blaming men, every single time i talk about the fact that male victims of domestic violence are mocked feminists say "you are complaining for social norms you created" The patriarchy theory is inherently sexist. you can't be egalitarian if you don't reject it. " Men were the ones in control for most of history " well, this is false. Historically, English family law gave custody of the children to the father after a divorce because the father is able to provide for the child. Until the 19th century, the women had few individual rights and obligations, most being derived through their fathers or husbands. In the early nineteenth century, Caroline Norton, a prominent female social reformer author, journalist, and society beauty, began to campaign for the right of women to have custody of their children. During wars women formed groups to shame men who don't participate in war calling them cowards, this happend in the UK in the US civil war etc ... Watch this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ePxXMsNWk amp;ab\_channel=CassieJaye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ePxXMsNWk amp;ab_channel=CassieJaye)  #8203; And also men didn't make the laws to benefit men. For example men were excluded from the forced labour convention of 1930 which was an international treaty that banned slavery but it made an exception for male age from 18 to 45 ! watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8B5d9lX5AY amp;t=377s amp;ab\_channel=CassieJaye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8B5d9lX5AY amp;t=377s amp;ab_channel=CassieJaye) Only 1% of men had real power and they didn't use their power to benefit other men. The patriarchy theory blame all men for the action of few, make the oppression and discrimination against men invisible. and make female privilige hidden.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, every single time men try to create men's issues club in college they face a backlash from feminists. i always get called incel whiner cry baby man-child by feminists for talking about men's issues. feminism made men's issues taboo. Feminists protested against the red pill documentary in all country .. In 2015, the University of York announced its intention to observe International Men #8217;s Day. A torrent of criticism ensued, including an open letter to the university claiming that such a day  #8220;does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed, inequalities #8221;. The university cancelled the plans and affirmed that  #8220;the main focus of gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by women #8221;. In contrast, its observation of International Women #8217;s day a few months earlier was a week long affair with more than 100 events. Author Warren Farrell went to give a talk on the boys #8217; crisis (boys dropping out of school and committing suicide at higher rates) at the University of Toronto, but he was opposed by protesters who  #8220;barricaded the doors, harassed attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at speakers and more #8221;. Opposition included leaders in the student union. Three students at Ryerson University (also in Toronto) tried to start a men #8217;s issues club. They were blocked by the student union, which associated the idea with supposed  #8220;anti-women #8217;s rights groups #8221; and dismissed the idea of sexism against men as an  #8220;oppressive concept #8221;.

    <TEXT>Men controlled all the resources and dominates all high positions in society ? no, men created the resources and dominated all high position in society because the life expectancy was 35 year old and infant mortality was very high therfore to continue the human race women must spend all their life having babies and raising children. Gender roles are the result of natural reality, not created by "evil men" to exploit women. A woman was the property of her father and then her husband ? this is not true. women were never considered property. it is stupid to even suggest that. Men were forced legally and socially to provide for women. this is an obligation and responsability not a privilige for men. because work was very hard in the past. " So one of my core themes in The Myth of Male Power #8212;that history #8217;s controlling force was not patriarchy, but survival #8212;is still ignored. Instead, the leading universities #8217; women #8217;s studies and  #8220;gender studies #8221; courses still emanate from the Marxist and Civil Rights model of oppressor vs. oppressed. We #8217;ll see in this book exactly why the dichotomy of oppressor/oppressed is both inaccurate and, more important, undermines love and women #8217;s empowerment. In virtually every leading university this leads to a demonizing of men and masculinity that distorts the very essence of traditional masculinity #8212;being socialized to be a hero by being willing to sacrifice oneself in war or in work. The possibility that being socialized to be disposable is not genuine power is, to this day, either considered radical, heretical, or, most frequently, not considered. "  #8203;  #8213; Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power. (read the book [here](https://archive.org/details/warren_farrell_the_myth_of_male_power_why_men_are_the_disposable_sex/mode/1up))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imagine if in your country there a movement that claim to fight for racial equality, and one of the goals of this movement is to end black violence against white people. both physical and sexual violence. Confrecences and workshops everythwere to teach aboiut "black violence against white people" .. they even passed the bill "Violence Against White People Act" that give billions of dollars to organisations that give free legal aid and therapy for white people who are victims of violence by black perpetrators. What will happen if a black person is a victim and call one of these org ? some of them will just say they don't help people like him/her. others will just ask what he did wrong ? i mean of course a white person won't just attack black person for no reason ! The government even created "Violence Against White People Office" ! they make awareness campaigns. in all their ad and posters you see a black person punching white person in state of fear in the floor. One of the leaders of this movement said "Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all black people keep all white people in a state of fear" that's why black only churches are banned. white only church are still allowed because some white people feel threatened by their presence. Some youtubers did a social experiment to see how people will react when a black is a victim of violence and people laughed at him/her ! There is also black people led organisations funded by universities to teach black people how to stop being violent (there is no equivalent org to teach white people how to stop being violent) One workshop called "chalenging blackness" ! the goal is to create a safe space for black people to chalenge what it means to be a black. according to this wonderful movement for racial equality most black people think that being black mean being violent and criminal ! Some so called "black civil rights acitivist" disagree ! they think all this is bigotry ! they say all races can be violent and a small percentage of black only engage in violence are a minority. they even suggest that anti violence awareness campaigns should be inclusive and show black victims too !! they must hate white people !! or at least this what the media say about them. # You don't have to imagine, everything here is already happening. just change "black" with "men" and "white" with "women" Despite the fact that [men are the overwhelming victims of *all* violent crime](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2018/51/fewer-women-than-men-fall-victim-to-violence), being at least [equally as likely to be raped](https://archive.fo/5Th6N), and [slightly over half of all Domestic Violence Victims.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) there is no male equivalent to the bill "Violence Against Women Act" and "Violence Against Women Office" All the media and awareness campaigns still treat domestic violence as something only happen to women by men.

This has worsened since 2015/16 where the figures were 61% for men (88% women).

    <TEXT>Why it's okay for women to say that men have it easier but we can't say women have it easier ?! just like i don't know what life looks like for women you don't know what life looks like for men. we should listen to each other instead of using slurs and shame/silencing tactics. saying you're coming off as a bit MRA is not an argument. we can also say you're coming off as a bit feminazi. It's ridiculous to say that society condones female violence at the expense of men ? really ? What happen when a man call abuse hotlines ? only 8% of the men who called hotlines classified them as "very helpful," whereas 69% found them to be "not at all helpful." Sixteen percent said the people at the hot line "dismissed or made fun of them." One abused man said:  gt;They laughed at me and told me I must have done something to deserve it if it happened at all. Another said:  gt;They asked how much I weighed and how much she weighed and then hung up on me...I was told by this agency that I was full of BS. Twelve percent of the hotlines accused the man of being the batterer or responsible for the abuse. One abused man said:  gt;They told me women don't commit domestic violence -- it must have been my fault. Another said:  gt;They accused me of trying to hide my "abuse" of her by claiming to be a victim, and they said that I was nothing more than a wimp. Another said:  gt;They didn't really listen to what I said. They assumed that all abusers are men and said that I must accept that I was the abuser. They ridiculed me for not leaving my wife, ignoring the issues about what I would need to do to protect my six children and care for them.

    <TITLE>" End black violence against white people "</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-15 02:35:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Imagine if in your country there is a movement that claim to fight for racial equality, and one of the goals of this movement is to end black violence against white people. both physical and sexual violence. Confrecences and workshops everythwere to teach about "black violence against white people" .. they even passed the bill "Violence Against White People Act" that give billions of dollars to organisations that give free legal aid and therapy for white people who are victims of violence by black perpetrators. What will happen if a black person is a victim and call one of these org ? some of them will just say they don't help people like him/her. others will just ask what he did wrong ? i mean of course a white person won't just attack black person for no reason ! The government even created "Violence Against White People Office" ! they make awareness campaigns. in all their ad and posters you see a black person punching white person in state of fear in the floor. One of the leaders of this movement said "Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all black people keep all white people in a state of fear" that's why black only churches are banned. white only church are still allowed because some white people feel threatened by their presence. Some youtubers did a social experiment to see how people will react when a black is a victim of violence and people laughed at him/her ! There is also black people led organisations funded by universities to teach black people how to stop being violent (there is no equivalent org to teach white people how to stop being violent) One workshop called "challenging blackness" ! the goal is to create a safe space for black people to challenge what it means to be a black. according to this "wonderful" movement for racial equality most black people think that being black mean being violent and criminal ! Some so called "black civil rights acitivist" disagree ! they think all this is bigotry ! they say all races can be violent and a small percentage of black only engage in violence are a minority. they even suggest that anti violence awareness campaigns should be inclusive and show black victims too !! they must hate white people !! or at least this what the media say about them. # You don't have to imagine, everything here is already happening. just change "black" with "men" and "white" with "women" Despite the fact that [men are the overwhelming victims of all violent crime](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2018/51/fewer-women-than-men-fall-victim-to-violence), being at least [equally as likely to be raped](https://archive.fo/5Th6N), and [slightly over half of all Domestic Violence Victims.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) there is no male equivalent to the bill "Violence Against Women Act" and "Violence Against Women Office" All the media and awareness campaigns still treat domestic violence as something only happen to women by men. Susan Brownmiller one the most famous feminist scholars in her book Against Our Will said "Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear." Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3PgH86OyEM amp;t=29s amp;ab_channel=TheMankindInitiative) video, see how people reacted when the victim is female and when is male. What happen when a man call abuse hotlines ? one [said](https://menarehuman.com/vawa/) "They laughed at me and told me I must have done something to deserve it if it happened at all." another said "They just laughed and hung up the phone." One famous feminist academic (read [here](https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/how-higher-education-studies-men/?fbclid=IwAR0kthEZ0QP0vmbJbcA_FyUWPyEeaoXaa5DUHea8aj46CkF0sDDDa-gCdvQ)) said women deserve  #8220;women-only spaces, #8221; but men-only spaces are verboten, because excluding women  #8220;reinforces the notion of male authority #8221; and men  #8220;need to learn how to communicate outside of traditional frames of masculinity and male sociality. #8221;  #8203;  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/11hglple76t51.jpg?width=1058 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=bbbe46d52565a72ca04b7cca1c54d662a4dc0b94</TEXT>

Over their lifetime, **79 percent of men** who were  #8220;made to penetrate #8221; someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had **female perpetrators**.  #8203;  gt;We also pooled four years of the [National Crime Victimization Survey](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail amp;iid=245) (NCVS) data and found that 35 percent of male victims who experienced rape or sexual assault reported at least one female perpetrator. Among those who were raped or sexually assaulted by a woman, **58 percent of male victims** and 41 percent of female victims reported that the incident **involved a violent attack, meaning the female perpetrator hit, knocked down or otherwise attacked the victim, many of whom reported injuries**.  #8203;  gt;And, because we had previously shown that nearly one million incidents of sexual victimization happen in our nation #8217;s prisons and jails each year, we knew that no analysis of sexual victimization in the U.S. would be complete without a look at sexual [abuse happening behind bars](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svrfsp08.pdf). We found that, contrary to assumptions, **the biggest threat to women serving time does not come from male corrections staff. Instead, female victims are more than three times as likely to experience sexual abuse by other women inmates than by male staff.**  gt;Also surprisingly, women inmates are more likely to be abused by other inmates than are male inmates, **disrupting the long held view that sexual violence in prison is mainly about men assaulting men. In** [**juvenile corrections facilities**](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svjfry12.pdf)**, female staff are also a much more significant threat than male staff; more than nine in ten juveniles who reported staff sexual victimization were abused by a woman.** In short, rape is not something only men do like the identity politics adherent claim. # Feminism is the mother of identity politics:  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/8k8n76nepft51.png?width=758 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=ead7bdcaf3eeb605ed40b49910911eb1cd033a28 Gender equality is good, but feminism has nothing to do with equality. Robin Morgan founder and editor of Ms. Magazine the biggest feminist magazine in the US said "I feel that ** #8216;man-hating #8217; is an honorable and viable political act**, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them. " When a woman reaches \*\*\*\*\*\* with a man she is only collaborating with the patriarchal system, eroticizing her own oppression. Sheila Jeffrys I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He #8217;s just incapable of it. Barbara Jordan, former Congresswoman Nancy pelosi and margaret thatcher have more compassion than Bernie Sanders ?! You can find supremacist quotes (some of them openly say women are superior) from all feminist leaders from the first wave until the current time. from both radical feminists and intersectional feminist. (For criticism of feminism from left wing read **Ernest Belfort Bax)** Feminism and all identity politics is the weapon of elite against the working class. all feminist org are funded by the big banks. (If you disagree with feel free to comment, but without slurs like calling me MRA, Incel etc etc ... use logic and reason. ) https://preview.redd.it/633h58m6pft51.png?width=854 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=02fd3177a7b6113fb2964f56944caa9606773521</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; he keeps posting here to lament about the lack of men #8217;s shelter but instead of exposing how there #8217;s a real need for it, he keeps blaming feminists for it. Why there is lack of men #8217;s shelter ? because "Violence Against Women Act" was written by feminists and they excluded male victims. saying don't blame feminists for the lack of men's shelters is like saying don't blame nazis for the holocaust.  gt;The article he posted clearly says 97% of people who rape women are men but supposedly feminists are evil for not spending more time talking about female on female rape? Why shouldn #8217;t they talk about the fact that it #8217;s overwhelmingly men that rape women? I didn't talk about female on female rape. The article also say 79 percent of men are raped by women. why feminists only talk about female rape victims and ignore male rape victims ? is you hate rape you should advocate for all victims. maybe feminists want to demonize men ? why ignoring female on male rape ? why presenting rape as only men perpetrators and only women as victims ?  #8203;  gt;I #8217;m sure men being raped is a real problem but then organise, guys. Bring awareness to the issue. If you do nothing you can #8217;t go around complaining nothing is done and how it #8217;s all someone else #8217;s fault for not taking care of your issues. it #8217;s all someone else #8217;s fault for not taking care of your issues ? the lack of men's shelters is only my issues ? it's not your issue ? why ? you don't care about equality ? why ? i was told feminism is about equality ? you just exposed youself as a man hating feminazi. Yes feminists are responsible because the bill and programs are written by them. and also because they shut down any conversation about men's rights. A [proposal](https://archive.is/ije1c) at Simon Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a men #8217;s centre on campus (to address issues like suicide, addiction, and negative stereotypes) was opposed by the existing women #8217;s centre. Their alternative suggestion was a  #8220;male allies project #8221; to  #8220;bring self-identified men together to talk about masculinity and its harmful effects #8221;. Author Warren Farrell went to give a talk on the boys #8217; crisis (boys dropping out of school and committing suicide at higher rates) at the University of Toronto, but he was [opposed](http://archive.is/gDvn0) by protesters who  #8220;barricaded the doors, harassed attendees, pulled fire alarms, chanted curses at speakers and more #8221;. Opposition included leaders in the [student union](https://archive.is/9zVr0). Three students at Ryerson University (also in Toronto) tried to start a men #8217;s issues club. They were blocked by the student union, which associated the idea with #160;supposed  #8220;anti-women #8217;s rights groups #8221; and dismissed the idea of sexism against men as an  #8220;[oppressive concept](https://archive.is/Jlac1) #8221;. The union passed a motion saying it rejects #160; #8220;Groups, meetings events or initiatives \[that\] negate the need to centre women #8217;s voices in the struggle for gender equity #8221;. Professor #160;Janice Fiamengo tried to give a talk in Ottawa on men #8217;s issues, only to be [interrupted](https://archive.is/TfVwd) by students #160;shouting, blasting horns, and pulling the fire alarm. Christian Hoff Sommers (known for her conservative/individualist/libertarian [perspective](https://archive.is/IGkLt) on gender issues) gave a talk at Oberlin College in Ohio. Activists hung up [posters](https://archive.is/IGkLt) identifying #160;the names of those who invited her as  #8220;supporters of rape culture #8221;. A student at Durham University in England was affected by the suicide of a close male friend, and so he tried to open up a  #8220;male human rights society #8221; on campus. His proposal was [rejected](https://archive.is/XxPC6) by the Societies Committee as  #8220;controversial #8221;, and he was told he could only have a men #8217;s group as a branch of the Feminist Society on campus. Journalist Cathy Young spoke at Saint Paul University (part of the University of Ottawa) in September 2015, on the topics of campus gender politics, GamerGate, neglect of men #8217;s issues, and focusing on women #8217;s victimization (for sexual violence and cyber-bullying). [Masked protesters](https://archive.is/gCjJg) called her  #8220;rape apologist scum #8221; and pulled the fire alarm. In 2015, the University of York announced its intention to #160;observe International Men #8217;s Day. A torrent of criticism ensued, including an open letter to the university claiming that such a day #160; #8220;does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed, inequalities #8221;. The university [cancelled](https://archive.is/fS3NQ) the plans and affirmed that #160; #8220;the main focus of gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by women #8221;. In contrast, its observation of International Women #8217;s day a few months earlier was a [week long affair with more than 100 events](https://archive.is/iRD10#selection-551.0-551.352).</TEXT>

Giving them places to live, healthcare and supporting their survival needs. Yes, historically .. today the left wing media and politicans are very hostile to men. openly saying "the future is female" and advocating for discriminatory programs in all areas of life. i'm not saying we should switch to right wingers but i can undrestand why men feel that way about the current feminist left.

    <TEXT>No, the first MRA was Ernest Belfort Bax a socialist who lived between 1854 and 1926. he wrote The Legal Subjection of Men (read [here](https://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/page/n24/mode/2up)) and The Fraud of Feminism. From his Wikipedia:  #8203;  gt;Bax was a passionate advocate for the social and [legal rights of men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_rights_of_men), which he saw as lacking in comparison to the [legal rights of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_rights_of_women). His first major article on the subject was *Some Bourgeois Idols; Or Ideals, Reals, and Shams* (1886), in which he proposed that women were privileged under law at the expense of men.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-5) He was to continue writing articles on this topic for most of his life, published notably in *Social Democrat*, and *Justice*, and later in [*The New Age*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Age).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-6)  gt;  gt;In 1896, he wrote *The Legal Subjection of Men*[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-Subjection-7) whose title is a play on [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill)'s 1869 essay "[The Subjection of Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subjection_of_Women)." In the volume, Bax draws on his extensive experience as a barrister to demonstrate the numerous ways in which the legal code worked in favour of women and to the detriment of men and boys. Chapters in the book include 'Matrimonial Privileges of Women', 'Non-Matrimonial Privileges of Women', 'The Actual Exercise of Women's Sex Privileges', and 'A Sex Noblesse'.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-Subjection-7)  gt;  gt;Bax was an active [antifeminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifeminism) since, according to him, feminism was failing to address inequities for both sexes evenly. According to Bax, the "anti-man crusades" of his day were responsible for anti-man laws being both preserved from the old legal canon, and for new laws being passed that were also anti-male and sexist.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-Subjection-7) Bax wrote many articles in *The New Age* and elsewhere about English laws partial to women against men, and women's privileged position before the law, and expressed his view that [women's suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage) would unfairly tip the balance of power to women.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-8) In 1913 he published a book, *The Fraud of Feminism*,[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-9) detailing feminism's adverse effects.  gt;  gt;Bax's concern for [men's equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_equality) fuelled his interest in socialism, to which he turned for a potential solution to what he viewed as the exploitation of males by the capitalist system:  gt;  gt;"The highest development of modern capitalism, as exemplified in the English-speaking countries, has placed man to all intents and purposes, legally under the heel of woman. So far as the relations of the sexes are concerned, it would be the task of Socialism to emancipate man from this position, if sex-equality be the goal aimed at. The first step on the road towards such equality would necessarily consist in the abolition of modern female privilege."[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Belfort_Bax#cite_note-Subjection-7):63</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The screenshot is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKJ8x9ut1hU amp;ab_channel=StudioBrule) video on the Empathy Gap. the first example is when men are killed or die the media use terms like "people" or "workers" ! but when women die their sex is highlighted in the titles. The UK gov started "Female Offender Strategy" but no "Male Offender Strategy" despite the fact that 95% of people in prison are males ! This is a result of the way the society see men and women as explain Jordan Holbrook in the article "[Why we need to change the attitude that  #8216;men are the criminals, women are the victims](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2019/02/27/why-we-need-to-change-the-attitude-that-men-are-the-criminals-women-are-the-victims/) #8217;"  #8203;  gt;This psychological template is why **government policy is to treat women as victims** (thus, not criminals) whereas **men are discarded and treated as criminals** (thus, not victims). Various guidelines (The Female Offender Strategy, Corston Report, President of the Supreme Court Baroness Brenda Hale OBE #8217;s influential 2005 Longford Trust Lecture and the Equal Treatment Bench Book) all say that female offenders #8217; life histories must be considered when they are passing through the criminal justice system. Have they endured abuse? Do they suffer from adverse mental health? Ultimately, are they victims? This line of enquiry is not extended to men. By considering the negative aspects of their life histories, **female offenders are awarded softer sentences and treatments to support  amp; accommodate them**. The template of women as victims and men as perpetrators is applied, leading to a massive sex discrepancy in the prison population.  #8203;  gt;But how many men in the Criminal Justice System should be receiving psychological help instead of punishment? [At the Male Psychology Conference 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziUmxWW-0ig), Dr Naomi Murphy from the Fens Offender Personality Disorder Pathway Service at HMP Whitemoor spoke of her work with offenders in her care. She found:  gt;  gt;* #8226; 66.1% reported childhood sexual abuse* * #8226; 72.6% reported childhood physical abuse* * #8226; 80.6% reported childhood neglect* * #8226; 66.1% reported childhood emotional abuse* * #8226; 59.7% reported parental antipathy* * #8226; 43.5% reported parental domestic violence* * #8226; 54% of the men who were sexually abused were victimized by a woman*  gt;  gt;Thus around 65% of the men she worked with had suffered some form of childhood abuse which, if it had been caught sooner by the system, could have resulted in these men being directed away from incarceration and towards the help they need. But for some reason policy makers ignore all the research.</TEXT>

The Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare, is a United States federal statute enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. this creted at least 7 new agencies and departments devoted solely to women while there is not one office for men or male specific ailments. as explain Caroline May in "[Does Obamacare discriminate against men?](https://dailycaller.com/2010/12/10/does-obamacare-discriminate-against-men/)" Men #8217;s health advocates long have pushed for an Office of Men #8217;s Health to act as a companion to the Office on Women #8217;s Health, established in 1991. Instead of rectifying that disparity, the new health care law intensified it. (until now **there is no Men's Health Office** !!) Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, has been critical of Obama #8217;s gender policies, charging that his administration has **pushed initiatives that favor women over men**. According to Roth, the health care bill was no different.  #8220;\[The women #8217;s\] lobby is very well funded, active and vocal. It is really paradoxical because women in many ways are doing better than men, so for example, if you do a search in the health care bill **there is not one mention of  #8216;prostate #8217; and are over 40 mentions of  #8216;breast #8217; and men are tax payers, they should get equal health treatment**, #8221; Roth told The Daily Caller Roth stressed that the high number of women #8217;s agencies and lack of corresponding men #8217;s offices was **not just a symbolic display of inequality, but one that would have real world repercussions, namely in the distribution of research funding**.  #8220;People don #8217;t understand that **men on average live about 5 less years than women**. That 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women in their lifetime will be diagnosed with cancer. That **men lead in 9 out of the 10 top ten causes of death**. When you look at the data and the facts it is really not part of the debate in health care and I think those are statistics and facts that need to be brought to light, #8221; Around the world there is 45 country with [Male-Only Forced](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2020/06/07/conscription-a-gender-based-injustice-around-the-world/) Conscription. Erin Pizzey is the founder of the first shelter for domestic abuse victims, it was for female victims. she wanted to create another for male victims. [she say](https://youtu.be/_D73v1lKcMo?t=564) \[9:25 ; 9:45 \] :  gt;That's when i wanted a men's house, an equal .. i got a house for rent and **not a one single (wealthy) man who supported my refuge and bought me houses for women and children would put a hand in their pocket for other men** and this is still the case .. Cassie Jaye the filmmaker of [The Red Pill documentary](http://theredpillmovie.com/) on the men's rights movement needed funding for the post production of her film, so she started searching for non-profits that give grants for humanitarian causes. [she say](https://archive.is/QXMqR) :  gt;I started to see the bias towards women #8217;s films and against men #8217;s. **There are no categories for men #8217;s films** though there are several for women and minorities. **I submitted the film to human rights categories, and was rejected by all of them**. #8221; As you can see men in power (politics or business) does not equal privilege for men as a class, not even equality for men ! i can give one million example of men creating discriminatory policy and programs against men and boys in favor of women and girls. # Women have no power ? An [OECD report](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/) on gender in education, across more than 60 countries, found that girls receive higher marks compared with boys of the same ability. Researchers suggest girls are better behaved in class and this influences how teachers perceive their work. Differences in school results can sometimes "have little to do with ability", says the study. (teaching is female dominated sector)In [2017 the UK #8217;s then Chief Medical Officer](https://gendemic.co.uk/lack-of-mens-health-strategies-may-have-cost-lives-in-pandemic) Dame Sally Davies (who is a woman) replied to requests from the Men  amp; Boys Coalition to state that she had no plans to conduct an annual report into men #8217;s health, despite having published a detailed and extensive annual report into women #8217;s health strategy in 2015.As explain the Men And Boys Coalition in their article "[chief medical officer refuses multiple requests to place equal focus on the health of men and women](http://www.menandboyscoalition.org.uk/newsevents/chief-medical-officer-refuses-multiple-requests-to-place-equal-focus-on-the-health-of-men-and-women/)" : **Her refusal follows multiple requests**, first in the form of a joint letter in March 2016 prior to establishment of the Coalition, and then in March 2017 on behalf of the Coalition. The Coalition steering group is particularly concerned by her decision, not only due to the many grave health issues affecting men and boys in the UK that would benefit from the much needed focus such a report would offer, but also because **the CMO has refused to offer any explanation as to why she has chosen not to give equal focus on the health of men** as she rightly has done on the health of women. Clearly she refused because she is sexist, in another occasion she said she will only hire female doctors to work with her. imagine if a man said that ? A [proposal](https://archive.is/ije1c) at Simon Fraser University (near Vancouver) to open up a men #8217;s centre on campus (to address issues like suicide, addiction, and negative stereotypes) was opposed by the existing women #8217;s centre. The [National Union of Students in the UK called](http://www.inside-man.co.uk/2016/05/31/nus-man-problem/) for all LGBT societies to drop the position of gay men #8217;s representative in a motion that also concluded that gay males were the likely perpetrators of sexism, racism and transphobia. This assertion wasn #8217;t backed up by facts and figures or even anecdotal testimony. The NUS is controled by women, for example committee member Sarah Noble who last year was suspended from the Liberal Democrats for Tweeting her desire to "**kill all men**". Sorana Vieru who in September Tweeted: "**I #8217;m no fan of cis white men**". Shelly Asquith said she was **repulsed at having to "face disgusting men**" on her commute to work. Between 2007 and May 2009 (the recession) nearly 80 percent of the job loss had been held by men. but when the government wanted to help male dominated industries they faced a backlash from the women's groups. as explain Christina Hoff Sommers in her article [No Country for Burly Men](https://archive.is/A0j1u): How feminist groups skewed the Obama stimulus plan towards women's jobs.  gt;**Men are bearing the brunt of the current economic crisis because they predominate in manufacturing and construction, the hardest-hit sectors**, which have lost more than 3 million jobs since December 2007. Women, by contrast, are a majority in recession-resistant fields such as education and health care, which gained 588,000 jobs during the same period. Rescuing hundreds of thousands of unemployed crane operators, welders, production line managers, and machine setters was never going to be easy. But the concerted **opposition of several powerful women's groups** has made it all but impossible. Consider what just happened with the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Women's groups were appalled. Grids? Dams? Opinion pieces immediately appeared in major newspapers with titles like "Where are the New Jobs for Women?" and "The Macho Stimulus Plan." A group of "notable feminist economists" circulated a petition that quickly garnered more than 600 signatures, calling on the president-elect to add projects in health, child care, education, and social services and to "institute apprenticeships" to train women for "at least one third" of the infrastructure jobs. At the same time, more than 1,000 feminist historians signed an open letter urging Obama not to favor a "heavily male-dominated field" like construction: "We need to rebuild not only concrete and steel bridges but also human bridges." As soon as these groups became aware of each other, they formed an anti-stimulus plan action group called WEAVE-- Women's Equality Adds Value to the Economy. The senior economists listened attentively as Gandy and Smeal and other advocates argued for a stimulus package that would add jobs for nurses, social workers, teachers, and librarians in our crumbling "human infrastructure" (they had found their testosterone-free slogan). **Did Furman mention that jobs in the "human infrastructure"--health, education, and government--had increased by more than half a million since December 2007?** Clearly saying women have no power is stupid. women as a class have a lot of power. men's rights groups are considered hate groups by the mainstream media. and men's voices are considered illegitimate when talking on gender issues. # Only a sexist deny the existence of sexism against men: Denying the existence of sexism against men is an example of sexism, no one deny sexism against women. but with all the evidences of institutional sexism against men some people still say misandry is not real ?! these are just few examples i can give you one million example in all countries and in all areas of life. You want more examples watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWNzdwJKbAI amp;ab_channel=MrSilhouette) video. \#MensRightsAreHumanRights</TEXT>

Most feminists deny that misandry exist. and they only care about women's issues and women's rights but not only ignore men's issues and men's rights but they want to silence any one who talk about them. that's why i'm an ex feminist.

    <TEXT>They want to liberate women from traditional gender role and responsibility but force traditional gender role and responsibility on men. The blog "[because it's 2015](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2016/08/06/a-non-feminist-faq/#addressing)" explain this perfectly :  #8203;  gt;One of the biggest issues in feminism is  #8220;violence against women #8221;. There are countless campaigns to end it or saying it #8217;s  #8220;[too common](http://archive.is/4SPTN) #8221;, and feminist celebrity Emma Watson #160;[says](http://archive.is/LaRLJ) #160; #8220;\[i\]t #8217;s sad that we live in a society where women don #8217;t feel safe #8221;. But, as explained previously, women aren #8217;t doing any worse in terms of violence victimization. In that context, the implication of this rhetoric is that women #8217;s safety is more important than men #8217;s. This clearly plays to traditionalist notions of chivalry that here help women.  gt;  gt;(Women do #160;*feel* less safe. From a [2011 article](http://www.academia.edu/1750368/Fear_of_Crime_and_Personal_Vulnerability_Examining_Self_Rated_Health), #160; #8220;\[w\]omen fear #160;crime at much higher levels than men, despite women being less likely #160;to be crime victims #8221;. But actual chance of victimization is more important than fear. Otherwise a middle class white person is worse off than a poor black person who #8217;s probably less sheltered/fearful.)  gt;  gt;Also, one frequently touted benefit of feminism for men is that it frees them from their gender roles like the [stigma of crying](http://archive.is/I2Lnv#selection-2625.55-2625.92). However, one go-to method for mocking or attacking men is to label them [cry-babies](http://archive.is/4qxfC#selection-1951.1-1951.29), whiners, complainers, or man-children, labels that clearly have roots in shaming of male weakness and gender role non-compliance. This is evident in a common feminist  #8220;male tears #8221; meme, which [originated](http://archive.is/1pnlM#selection-1785.114-1785.228) with the goal of making fun  #8220;of men who whine about how oppressed they are, how hard life is for them, while they still are privileged #8221;. It #8217;s been used by feminists #160;[Amanda Marcotte](http://archive.is/mpBPC#selection-669.1-759.37), Jessica Valenti (first picture), and #160;Chelsea G. Summers.  gt;  gt;MIT professor Scott Aaronson #160;[opened up](http://archive.is/8YkWe#selection-5879.0-5897.140) on his blog about the psychological troubles he experienced after internalizing negative attitudes about male sexuality, which partly came from the portrayed connection between men and sexual assault in feminist literature and campaigns. He was clear he was still  #8220;97% on board #8221; with feminism. Amanda Marcotte responded with an article called #160; #8220;[MIT professor explains: The real oppression is having to learn to talk to women](https://archive.is/fsdYe) #8221;, which included a  #8220;cry-baby #8221; picture at the top. #160;Another  #8220;cry-baby #8221; attack comes from an article on the #160;feminist gaming website [*The Mary Sue*](http://archive.is/Xavbl).  gt;  gt;Another example of this general attitude is the #160;[\#MasculinitySoFragile](http://archive.is/7XNaP) #160;Twitter hashtag used #160;to  #8220;call out and mock stereotypical male behaviors that align with the feminist concept of  #8216;toxic masculinity, #8217; which asserts that certain attributes of the Western machismo archetype can be self-detrimental to those who embrace them #8221;. It #8217;s like challenging beauty standards for women with #FemininitySoUgly; that #160;doesn #8217;t challenge those standards, it reinforces them.  gt;  gt;Many feminist approaches to sexual assault and domestic violence reinforce gender traditionalism by downplaying or excluding anything outside of the #160; #8220;male perpetrator, female victim #8221; paradigm. Mary P. Koss, an influential feminist voice on rape (and professor at the #160;University of Arizona), says that it is  #8220;inappropriate #8221; to say that men can be raped by women. She instead calls it  #8220;engaging in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman #8221; ( #8220;[The Scope of Rape](http://www.avoiceformalestudents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf) #8221;, 1993, page 206). For domestic violence, the article  #8220;[Beyond Duluth](http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2027 amp;context=mlr) #8221; by Johnna Rizza of the University of Montana School of Law describes the Duluth Model, an influential domestic violence prevention program in the United States that takes a #160; #8220;feminist psycho-educational approach #8221; to the problem.  gt;  gt;*Practitioners using this model inform men that they most likely batter women to sustain a patriarchal society. The program promotes awareness of the vulnerability of women and children politically, economically, and socially.*  gt;  gt;According to Rizza, the Duluth Model is the most commonly state-mandated model of intervention, and the #160;*only* statutorily acceptable treatment model in some states.</TEXT>
