    <TITLE>Help interpreting employment contract clause</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-27 09:44:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Currently employed by a company in England that produces tools for the DIY and professional markets. I have an idea for a tool which my employer (nor any other company according to my research) currently does not have in their range. If produced for retail, it would though still compete with products in my employer #8217;s range, by looking to entice customers to my replacement product instead of what my employer currently has on offer. I have developed self-made prototypes and I #8217;m confident in the idea, so feel ready to begin seeking more serious advice on starting a company and trying to bring my product to market. I #8217;ve been looking to leave the company for a while and I #8217;ve decided to resign, and put some time and effort into my invention for a while without worrying about juggling any work too. I checked my employment contract and as expected there were some clauses in there about not competing with my employer for a period of 3 months after termination. That #8217;s okay, I won #8217;t be bringing anything to market within 3 months. There #8217;s a clause (below) about inventions though that worries me. If I #8217;m interpreting it correctly, I think it means as I #8217;ve already had the idea it technically belongs to my company. And should it be successful, they might be inclined to investigate if I breached this clause. Computer records and meetings I #8217;ve had with local business planning/ startup support organisations will confirm I have. 21.2 also refers to  #8220;future works. #8221; Does this mean anything I do in future, post-employment, is still deemed to be property of my current employer? If you could ELI5 this clause for me that would really help. Thanks in advance. 21. Inventions The following definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in this agreement. Appointment: the employment of you by the Company on the terms of this agreement. Intellectual Property Rights: patents, rights to Inventions, copyright and related rights, trade marks, trade names and domain names, rights in get-up, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off or unfair competition, rights in designs, rights in computer software, database rights, rights to preserve the confidentiality of information (including know-how and trade secrets) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for and be granted, renewals or extensions of, and rights to claim priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which may now or in the future subsist in any part of the world. Inventions: inventions, ideas and improvements, whether or not patentable, and whether or not recorded in any medium. 21.1 You acknowledge that all works embodying Intellectual Property Rights made wholly or partially by You at any time during your employment with the Company shall automatically, on creation, vest in the Company absolutely. To the extent that they do not vest automatically, You hold them on trust for the Company. You agree to promptly execute all documents and do all acts as may, in the opinion of the Company, be necessary to give effect to this clause. 21.2 You hereby irrevocably waive all moral rights under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (and all similar rights in other jurisdictions) which he has or will have in any existing or future works referred to in this clause</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you #8217;re going to ask the new company to match the bonus I don #8217;t really think there #8217;s any way to dress it up. It is what it is... you #8217;re just saying  #8220;I don #8217;t really want to leave that money on the table, is there any way to could offer to match it? #8221; You might need to just write off the bonus, and there #8217;s lots and lots of factors to consider here before you decide if that #8217;s the right thing to do. For example, does the salary increase offset the bonus you #8217;ll lose? Salary is pensionable whereas the bonus likely isn #8217;t... how far into your career are you? What are your future ambitions? Etc. Etc. You need to weigh everything up and decide what #8217;s the best play here, good luck</TEXT>

Your opinion is specifically that individuals have no excuse for not knowing everything about their nation #8217;s history. What difference does it make if I know how the empire treated [insert citizens of colonised country]...

    <TITLE>Would wayleave agreements usually be discovered during conveyancing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-12 11:23:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I bought a house in March which has overhead power cables running diagonally across the garden to service several local houses. The mast is just on the other side of my wall so not on my land, but four cables (including the one to my house) run across my garden. At the time of purchase I did notice them but didn #8217;t really think on it. We #8217;ve now removed some hedging and trees, and the cables are far more prominent and unsightly. We #8217;re also hoping to extend, which would require moving the site where  #8216;our #8217; power cable attaches to our own house wall. Whilst researching how easy/difficult that is to do, I came across something called a  #8220;Wayleave agreement. #8221; As I (a total layman) understand it these agreements pertain to power installations on (or aerially above) private land, and in some cases require the services company to compensate the landowner by way of an annual  #8216;ground rent #8217; for want of a better term. As well as this ongoing annual commitment, the landowner can potentially also claim financial compensation for historic usage where no agreement was in place. As I understand it though this is on a one-and-done basis, regardless of changes of ownership. I #8217;ve read and reread my conveyancing report and can find no mention of such an agreement, neither that one exists nor that there #8217;s potential for such an agreement to be brokered. It doesn #8217;t mention that the land has ever been involved in a compensation claim as mentioned above. Are these things that should usually be picked up by the solicitor? Is it safe to assume that no agreement exists based on it being absent from the report? Instinctively it feels like quite an abstruse area of law, so I would understand if not. Also, if I investigated this further and then eventually pursued action to install a wayleave agreement, do you think it #8217;s likely this may come back to bite me down the line (when I want to extend) if I #8217;m then asking the power company for help re-siting the supply to my property? Finally, I understand there #8217;s a chance that if I pursued this the power company could in turn petition the authorities to make it a  #8220;permanent and necessary #8221; fixture, which I believe if successful means no rent would be due to the landowner and it may potentially also hamper any future development plans I have, maybe even damage the resale value of the property. Does anyone have experience of this? Is that a serious risk I should consider? Edit: England</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When does redundancy notice period begin?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 12:56:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tried ACAS and YouGov but they don #8217;t answer my specific question around what constitutes  #8216;notice. #8217; Hoping some nice HR professional (oxymoron?... sorry couldn #8217;t resist!) can help me out. For the purposes of my timeline leaving date =  #8216;R. #8217; TLDR; does confirmation of leave date only constitute notice even if other terms aren #8217;t defined? My mother applied and was accepted for voluntary redundancy. Following the initial announcement the company set a deadline (R minus 16 weeks) for employees to indicate their preference. They also published an Excel-based redundancy payout calculator to help employees make an informed decision. It was heavily disclaimered (an indication not a guarantee, accept no liability for financial loss, etc.) Mother accepted that and volunteered for redundancy. All good so far. Company communicated decisions at R-13 when Line Manager called my mother to say basically,  #8220;we #8217;ve accepted and your leave date is R. #8221; LM had several other similar calls to make on the same day so nothing else was discussed at the time, but LM did follow up with a group email (all her direct reports who were accepted) saying  #8220;congratulations, sorry to be losing you all but I understand it #8217;s something you want. We #8217;ll have to organise some Zoom drinks before you all leave on R. #8221; We #8217;re now at R-9. Since then LM has been on leave and redundancy hasn #8217;t been discussed at all. No official offer letter, payout hasn #8217;t been confirmed, total radio silence. Mother has tried to chase this by emailing HR (offshore, no published telephone number) to no avail. So the crux of my post: is my mother officially under notice and does the leaving date of R stand? Or could she insist on 12 weeks notice from the  #8220;official #8221; confirmation being received? (Assuming the call and informal email don #8217;t make it  #8220;official. #8221;) She #8217;s not planning on working again after this so it #8217;s not important in terms of planning starting a new job, and she doesn #8217;t particularly mind working over Christmas as she #8217;s wfh and the workload is pretty minimal anyway. The thing is though, the company #8217;s redundancy pay policy is 4 weeks salary for every full year of service. If we count 12 weeks from now, she #8217;ll actually tick over another full year and stand to gain ~ #163;3000 extra. Understandably she doesn #8217;t want to leave this on the table... is this something she could insist on? Thanks England Edit: adding she #8217;s been there long enough that statutory notice is 12 weeks</TEXT>
