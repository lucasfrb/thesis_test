    <TEXT>Just wanted to share this with you guys. I said to myself once I reached hcp 20 I would play Royal Golf Club de Belgique (one of the nicest courses of Belgium). I never expected this to be in my first year of playing golf but OK. Now because I'm 21, I still am considered a junior. Meaning I can play one of the most beautiful courses of Belgium for only 20 euro's (instead of a whopping 110 euro's). I'm quite happy with that!! That's why I wanted to share that with you guys :-D. http://www.rgcb.be/oldcourse_images/oldcourse_clubhouse.jpg http://www.golfworldresorts.com/images/pages/100/Brabant_Golf_Waterloo_020.jpg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a question. Today a friend at the golf course asked if I wanted to switch my set for his. He's getting a little older and he's looking for a club which is a little easier. My clubs have longer shafts (I bought them like that) and that would be better for his back. Now I only want to know if this is a good/ok deal for me. I hit some shots on the range with them and they are pretty good. This weekend I'm going to test them on the course and see how they are to properly play with. Sidenote: I get a Taylormade driver (no idea which one but it has white on top and black face with stiff shaft because he went back to a regular shaft) with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually play a lot without warming up (22 years old, flexible body ;) ) but for non practice rounds: I leave my house around 1 hour before tee time. It's only a 15-20 minute drive so I arrive on time. I start of with hitting 36 balls on the range. Some half wedges, full wedges, 8i-7i-5i-4i, hybrid and 2-3 drives. Then I go chipping for a few minutes. Not really to train (I do that in practice rounds or on "training days") but to check the speed of the greens. Then I go putting until tee-time. First tee, no practice swing and a 8i or 7i depending on the wind on our first hole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly what I'm feeling atm. Driving distance is outstanding (for my hcp) but the shots after are a disaster. Driving 270 meters (around 300 yards) to shank a wedge into the green on a par 4. It's so frustrating because after phenomenal drive you still end up with a bogey at it's best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well: no idea. I just go with feel. I have a 60 #176; with almost no bounce, I use it for bunkers (one of the best aspects of my game. says a lot about my game probably if I keep ending up in the sand ;) ) and a 56 #176; with, I think, 14 bounce on it for fairway shots and chips. Next buy will probably be a gap although I'm quite happy with hitting feel shots with the pitch.</TEXT>

Nevertheless I played quite good. I was 2 over after 7 (!!!!!!!) and then it happened. Shanked a 56 degree wedge in the water. Came off with a triple. The final hole was a bogey which for me from that tee is pretty reasonable. How do you guys keep in the concentration towards the final holes?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Antwerp is a lovely city for students although it might be a little expensive from time to time. Beer prices will average around 2 euro a beer (depending on where you go ofcourse). The University of Antwerp is a good university and the organisation is pretty good. For activities you should become a member with ESN Antwerp, they're doing some nice activities etc. For accomodation try and search around the campus (I assume it's the campus near the prinsenstraat?). It's really in the city center and you're close to most student bars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi /r/runners Let's start by a little introduction. I'm subject96 from, you'll never guess, Belgium. I've never been a sporty type of guy but started running 2 years ago. By that time I was heavily overweight, it was time to do something. I went off for a exchange program to Lisbon, Portugal. It was lovely. I picked up a C25K program and went from [THIS](https://runkeeper.com/user/CMampaey/activity/437690844) to [THIS](https://runkeeper.com/user/CMampaey/activity/495889442) in 5 months. My first goal was completed. 5k in under 30 minutes. I arrived in Portugal as 97kg weighing 21 year old and left as a 83kg weighing 22 year old. Great success! Since that time I've had a few new PR's: I ran a faster [5K](https://runkeeper.com/user/CMampaey/activity/842389084) and my first [10K](https://runkeeper.com/user/CMampaey/activity/647212561) BUT My weight is been swinging between 79kg and 84kg. It's been more of the latter unfortunately. AND NOW: I want to lose 5-8 more kg's. 75kg would be a target (I'm only 1,79m). I've tried low BPM runs but it's SO SLOW and can't really find the patience to build it up. I mean 7:00 km pace is horrible to maintain :( I think HIIT is the way to go right? But there are so many programs out there, no idea which would fit me best or is the best. So please /r/running , help me out here (and I hope I didn't break any rules) Some extras: HR monitor: Polar H7 + iPhone 5 Running shoes: Nike Lunarglide 4 tl;dr: Looking for a way to burn fat. Got endurance (sort of) and think HIIT is the way to go but no idea which program to take.</TEXT>

I needed something to air my thoughts as well as show to myself I'm not a quitter. It resulted in a 12k run which is a PR! Whoop! Tempo sucked 6:55 min/km but low HR, 159 bom on average.

    <TEXT>Hello there /r/running. As i've did some research into weight loss in combination with running I found some articles stating that if you go and have run BEFORE breakfast (without eating anything) you would burn more fat then when you've had breakfast. What do you think is true? For the record: I'm not talking about long distances but about easy 3 miles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tempranillo: grape question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-27 17:09:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, lately I've been started to get interested in wine. My main "peers" where I learn from is Vivino and /r/Wine. I'm a 23 yo student (EU-based) starting to enjoy the finer things in life, where one of 'em is wine. I first started to enjoy white and ros #233; wine particularly in summer. But since a year I'm also enjoying the red wines. As my father is a great wine enthousiast (not an expert for sure) I tend to have the ability to taste great wines. So, lately I've been started to get interested in wine. My main "peers" where I learn from is Vivino and /r/Wine. I'm a 23 yo student (EU-based) starting to enjoy the finer things in life, where one of 'em is wine. I first started to enjoy white and ros #233; wine particularly in summer. But since a year I'm also enjoying the red wines. As my father is a great wine enthousiast (not an expert for sure) I tend to have the ability to taste great wines. Now I found myself 2 wines I really, really enjoy. It's the Topico Roble 2014 and the Campo Viejo Rioja Reserve 2011. Both of them are Tempranillo-grapes. As I live to a country next to France, french wines are very popular here. Now my question: what french grape is closest to Tempranillo taste wise? What french region should I start tasting to find something similar? Link 1 to Topico: https://www.vivino.com/wineries/topico/wines/tempranillo-syrah-2014 Link 2 to Campo Viejo: https://www.vivino.com/wineries/campo-viejo/wines/reserva-rioja-2011</TEXT>

Then, my birthday came up and I got this lovely watch from my girlfriend. It's a Fossil Grant Chronograph with a brown leather band. It's got a 44mm case and is quartz powered. Since I'm new here I can't really tell you more about this one but I hope to learn new things here about watches. Since I'm still a student I'll have to wait a little while to build a real collection but I think this is a nice start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first bottle porn post and still learning a lot about tasting wines. I'm trying to learn from all of you guys and giving it a try myself. First of all I want to say I'm pretty let down by it. Maybe because of the name, the renowned Ch #226;teuneuf-du-Pape, but I expected more of this. The nose is subtle at first but gets pretty acidic at the end. The taste is very balanced, easy and simple. No complexity, something I kind of expected (maybe that's wrong from my side). The length is not long yet not short either. A bit average which is actually very enjoyable. All in all not a bad wine, rated it 3,5/5 on Vivino but it could've been any wine. Not exceptional for a CdP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Key: http://imgur.com/a/cEWR0 Why is it you need to push the BMW logo to close the car, whilst marketing wise it would be more logical if it was the other way around. It would be more logical to me if you needed to push the BMW logo to open the car and start the sheer driving BMW pleasure experience.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any tips for trackman use?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-14 09:40:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>So here's the backstory: I found a driving range (little over an hour away from where I live) that let's you hit on bays equipped with a trackman. They charge 17,5 euro (18,69 dollar) an hour, something I don't find very expensive. So I'm willing to try that out, especially to check my distances (carry and total) these figures obviously speak for itself but is there something else I have to look out for? For instance: I've never understood the "smash factor", what should you aim for? How is this calculated? Also: spin rates. What should be normal with, let's say, a 7 iron? To be clear: not planning on taking a lesson in the first session so no pro to tell me what to look for. Good thing is they upload it immediately to an account on MyTrackman so you can check the numbers online and brag about that one 190 yards 7i you tinned. To put this in perspective: I'm a 10 hcp so pretty average golfer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You read so many things on the internet I really didn't know what to believe anymore. As /r/golf always has given me quite good advice I thought I would ask it here. About the handicap thingy: it might be my fault thinking a 10 is only average because I'm actually one of the highest handicaps of my friends. I still need to break 80 as well (did it once on a par 70 so not really the same) ... Thanks for your answer!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well in my head it's different. I shot a 78 which would mean on a 72 par course (as my home course, that's probably why it's my base number) I needed to have two more birdies, well two less bogeys would be more accurate. About the handicap thingy, still, I know I can hit a ball, it goes somehow how I want it to go and yes if I compare it to a average CC member then yeah I rock! But for my age and type of playing I still find I can do way better, that's why I think 10 is only average (for my age, for me, with my friends etc.). I def. don't want to sound like a knob!</TEXT>

It is dirt cheap (you still need to pay extra for your balls though), in Rotterdam, NL and a Tour Pro (Joost Luiten) has his own swing studio there so I assume it's pretty good quality (yes, his swing studio will not be the same trackman as the public area but still) Link: http://seve.nl (site is in DUTCH so you'll need google translate)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-03 09:33:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>So friday night my club is organizing a 3 clubs and a putter competition. I really like the idea and already have a selection in mind but would love to here what you guys would chose and why. My selection: 3 Wood 7 Iron 56 #176; wedge Putter Kind of covers it all. 3 wood over driver because I'm not only more accurate with it you can use it from the fairway as well. 7 iron or 6 iron, just to have an iron in the bag where you can also gain some height/meters with and the wedge for all shortgame uses. Flop, chip, bunker, approach etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently playing with the MP-37 and to be honest. They're lovely in the bag, they look very nice and when you hit them in the middle they are fire. But ... Ofcourse it's more difficult to hit 'em in the middle. On my hcp they're overkill but as a student I don't have a budget for new fitted irons. My advice (without knowing your hcp): have a look in a combo set where you have your short to mid irons in MB form and mid to long irons in AP2. As I see the current processes on tour, I don't think you have an advantage going back to blades as even the best in the world don't play 'em anymore (e.g.. Justin Rose switched back from blades etc.). PS: sorry for my english, not a native speaker.</TEXT>

Vokey wedges: 52 #176; oil can rust finish, 56 #176; SM5 and 60 #176; (with a crazy 4 degree bounce on it) in oil can rust finish. 4. Odyssey White Hot Teron putter. I like the look of my irons over the ball and the feel you get when you hit 'em flush. I actually don't really hate something. I plan on replacing everything as nothing in my bag is newly purchased. Still a student for now but with one of my first paychecks I plan on buying a full fitted new golf bag. Get rid of the blades as they might make the game more difficult then it already is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like to practice like a 100 balls with one club but from time to time I finish my practice session with some random clubs (no course on earth where you need to hit 100 consecutive 8 irons right?). Start with the driver or three wood and pick two objects where in-between you have an imaginable fairway. Second shit is a shot into the green, take a 9 or a 6 and aim at a certain object and so on. Also fun is to imagine a hole of your course. If, for instance, you hit your drive to the right, hit a stinger second shot out of the trees or so, then a 50 meter shot to the green or whatever.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Vineyard near Nice [FR], Monaco [MC] and San Remo [IT]?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-28 17:08:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the title kind of explains it all: I'm looking for a nice good vineyard near the France-Italian border around Monaco and Nice etc. with the ability to taste. If the vineyard has sparkling wine that would be a plus. I know the Prosecco region is on the other side of Italy but that's a little too far to go to. Apart from personal experiences, what are some tips to prepare this from homebase? I can google them or go to trip advisor but I'm afraid that would leave me ending up with only the touristic places. PS: sorry for the possibility of spelling/grammatical errors, I'm not a native speaker.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-10-15 09:55:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So let me sketch my situation: I've lived near a hockey club nearly whole my life. A lot of friends of me play it, or used to play it. My girlfriend plays it as well on a decent level. So after 20 odd years, yes I know ..., I finally gave in to give it a try. After 3 trainings so far I'm doing really good, my physique is near unexisting but my shots are pretty powerful apparently (thank you golf). Now I got a few questions: 1. Does anybody have a good interval training that's based on heart rate? 2. What to look for in equipment for a newbie? (I already have leg protection things, mouth protection and I have a hand me down stick I can use until I bought my own) What to look for in a stick for a newbie? 3. Does anybody have a nice overview of the rules or a website to study it from? 4. Any other tips are much appreciated! PS: I'm not a native speaker so excuse me for spelling errors or grammatical errors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I rarely hit driver because I outdrive most people with my 3 wood which I hit long and straight. Iron play is also pretty good I think. Good contact etc. Short game is my weakest point although I'm working on it, everything inside 100 meters is not sure to hit the green let alone be close. I think I should be better as a 10 as well, without being bragging etc. ATM I don't really know what it is and i kinda hope it all falls together after winter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, this feedback is much appreciated. Our biggest problem was that we needed validated scales, therefore we found some but they have reoccurring questions. Once you delete some of these questions the scales aren't validated anymore and then the academic hassles start. We found that most of our respondents indeed said it was wayyyyy to long. I'll have a look at the drop out rate but expect it to be exorbitant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We had this bottle as a present from friends. As CdP is a big name in the French wines we kept this for a night on the sofa where we could really enjoy the taste of this one. I was kind of disappointed. It was a bit sharp on the first sip, not really a round taste. Now that's as far as my /r/wine vocabulary goes but what I wanted to ask: is it because we drank it too early (5yo), maybe it needed some more oxygen? Any tips?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This could be true as well. I've been raised in a family where we drink lots of wine (not like alcoholics but you know during weekends etc). My dad is one of those guys that buys bottles of CdP, Barolo etc just because it says so. Not worrying about what winery it's from. I have to be honest and until now, he did a pretty good job or he was very lucky. Anyway. What I like is difficult to define. It depends on the mood. I like to drink stroke round wines like Barolo but also love the "easy" taste of a Tempranillo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys I'm thinking about taking a trip to the provence region in the end of August (Gigondas, Rasteau, Orange, Avignon, CdP, etc.) but have some additional questions: Is the end of august a good time to go there? Does it really matter when you go as the wines you buy are bottled anyway? How do you choose the wine houses to go to? Ofcourse you taste the wine whenever you have the chance. But what are typically things to look out for in the fields etc. to see if the wine is worth going to visit? We're lucky to speak the local language so that might help already. Any other tips are very welcome.</TEXT>

My guess is that courses like that are easier to understand in another language in comparison with STEM courses. If you take some practical courses I think you might be able to do it if you study some Portuguese on the side. Anyway: best experience ever!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Odd questions about a vacation trip</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-17 08:52:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi /r/wine I need some of your advice, I totally understand this is a broad question and probably most of you are US-based but I'm going to try nevertheless: In september my GF and I are going to live together after my recent graduation. We've been shopping furniture etc. but a nice vacation is now more than welcomed. We're lucky to live in Belgium, a small country located to the north of France and even more lucky to speak the local language. This gives the opportunity to ask locals for their opinion etc. Now for this trip we want to combine some sunbathing, swimming and buying wine for our new apartment. If you have nice B amp;B tips for the sunbathing/swimming part that would be lovely but that's definitely not my question. I wanted to know if any of you can give tips on what region would prefarble to visit. You have the Burgundy region, Bordeaux or even the Provence. I find it difficult to choose between those regions. What are the most important characteristics of this regions? Secondly: for the 2018 wine we'll be way to early because the harvest only starts towards the end of september if I'm not mistaken? Are the previous years considered to be "good wine years"? And lastly, as a newbie to the wine world, what makes a wine good for preserving for a few years. I know this is a lot to ask and very broad but any advice or insights in this matter are more than welcome. I'm looking to get into wines and I think some of your /r/wine have a lot of knowledge about this. Thanks in advance! PS: I'm not a native speaker so I'll excuse myself in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I might have made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it's definitely not. 1) we're having a heatwave. They're saving up on water and using it preferably on the greens. 2) even with a bad range you have to think about your fellow members.

    <TEXT>Something I try to say to most of my friends who want to try golf for the first time is to aim  #8220;in front #8221; of the ball. Meaning that you can pick a spot just an inch or so in front of your ball and focus on that point. It was an exercise my pro thought me when I started. He used a small piece of grass and it had to be gone when I hit the ball. In front meaning between ball and target. Hope this helps a little. If you want to take this game seriously in the future: start with lessons ASAP so you get a good base to start working from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys Short intro, partly related to my request: I live in Belgium. Belgium has 3 official languages being Dutch, French and German. Dutch is my native language but French is widely spoken in my country. To train my French I'm looking for a book written in rather easy language (my level is B2/Upper intermediate) but with a decent subject. I don't want to read children/adolescent books :-). I don't know if there are much french speaking people on /r/suggestmeabook but it's worth a try!  #8203;</TEXT>

Due to a windsurfing accident during an initiation (my windsurfing career took around 30 minutes :( ) I now suffer a sprained ankle. I know it is best to rest, which I'am doing for the moment but I also wanted to check what exercises I could still do. Currently I'm thinking about crunches, superman's, ... any other inspiration so I can make a "sprained ankle safe workout"?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Due to the Black Friday topic I've been looking into buying new wedges on Callaway Pre owned (BOGO deal on the wedges). Now, I've been playing a 56 #176; wedge for whole my golfing career. Not the same of course but it does mean that I "build" my wedge set around with: 60 #176; and 52 #176;. When I see on the site they also offer a 58, 54 and 50 #176; combination. But how do you choose one of both? Is it just to see what degree your PW is and adjust at that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. This one is difficult I would say that for a beginner it is not always worth the money to get fitted because your swing speed and swing in general will still change a lot. On the other hand, with your length, it might be worth it to get at least fitted for the right length of clubs. 2. I would always suggest to buy a set of irons separately from other clubs. The combo package is aimed for beginners but as you said, most are junky. Don #8217;t bother spending your money on this. There are different type of clubs, I would suggest you look towards the category  #8220;Game Improvement #8221; irons. Golf is already difficult as is, no need to make it even harder ;). 3. Lessons. YES! Get some, I still regret at this stage that I did not take sufficient lessons from the start. I don #8217;t know where you are based but where I #8217;m from the pros just keep teaching during winter (range only though). But then again we currently don #8217;t have snow or anything so that makes it already easier of course. I hope this already puts you in the right direction. If you have more questions, don #8217;t hesitate to ask! PS: sorry for formatting, I #8217;m on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't pay fees on it, so that's already that. Are you saying that with a YEARLY 30% tax return (which will be invested in IWDA for example) you don't outperform an index. I find that hard to belief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I calculated it. You're right. With 980 euro invested in a pension fund with 7.8% average return and the 280 tax return invested in IWDA would make 2946,53. 980 euro invested in IWDA over 10 years makes 3043,73 Mind you, we're talking about 80 euro over 10 years. Seems to me it's quite even.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>DIY Wine cellar</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-30 19:26:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>This might be an unusual post for this subreddit but I'm looking for advice into making/building my own wine cellar. In the link below you see two images of the current state (incl. all the stuff of the previous owner of the house). I was thinking to either make something underneath the stairs or to build something in the main cellar room. Only things I'm scared of: there is a lot of natural light (which is a plus for a cellar, just not for a wine cellar) and I don't know how stable the temperature will be. Do you guys have any examples/tips/advice/anything of a similar project? [https://imgur.com/a/hQk1Uz6](https://imgur.com/a/hQk1Uz6)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi HI'ers! My SO and I recently bought our first house and so my home improvement journey can begin. I've been a lurker on this sub for some time as I didn't really have anything to add to this sub! Until now! My first question: we bought a house which has an older boiler / central heating system. The plan is to replace this one with a more modern when we saved some extra money. In the meanwhile I was wondering if we can replace the current thermostat ( [https://imgur.com/a/fRRCq39](https://imgur.com/a/fRRCq39) ) with a more modern one (which offers planned on/off's etc.). Any advice from here?  #8203; PS: English is not my native language, sorry for possible mistakes</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is this the start of an anxiety problem?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-14 22:49:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I recently (mid-March) experienced a panic attack. It was triggered due to something that happened at work. For a project (I work in a large Corp) where I was the representative of my business line, I oversaw something and was called out about it by a colleague. In the end no harm was done, I went to my manager the next day (meeting at 08 am, I #8217;m still grateful that he made time for this) and he said everything would be fine. The panic attack really concerned me and I immediately contacted a therapist. I #8217;m lucky enough that, where I live, they are quite affordable. I was about to change functions first of July and already had somebody to handover the project to, he already helped me out between March and first of July so I #8217;m thankful to him as well. With the change of functions in sight and the stress/panick only happening when I was working this project. I was pretty confident this feeling would go away. But I feel that I #8217;m getting stressed/anxious about a lot more than only this project. Within the new job I #8217;m afraid of making a similar mistake again. But also non-professional related: we bought a house, covid, a PayPal transfer, ... everything I overthink, I always think about the worst case scenario. I #8217;m happy I have a very supportive S/O with whom I can talk about everything. To be honest: I don #8217;t know what to expect from posting here but I wanted to share with you guys. PS: English is my third language, I apologize for any errors I made.</TEXT>

I remember getting the first HP book of my grandmother (with whom we don't/didn't have the best connection). I hated reading at the time. My mother commented as well: "this shows how much she knows her grandson". As an action of politeness I started reading it anyway. I devoured it and haven't stopped reading books since. I feel like HP has a lot of kids gotten into reading.</TEXT>

The good times will be there, just not in the fashion as before, I think. If the master you want to do, is in Paris, I would not doubt. If you're specifically choosing that master BECAUSE it's in Paris, I might suggest to give it a good thought on what you expect from your master years. The city you fell in love with is still there, it's still the same. I've gone back to my erasmus city (Lisboa) as a tourist and expected too much of it (in terms of seeing people etc.)but yet loved my weekend there because the city didn't change.</TEXT>
