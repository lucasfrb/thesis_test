    <TEXT>Is what a real thing? It really just worked out as my work had an office in ATL, so I just worked out of there and stayed with some friends from college when I wasn't at the festival. I may just be more of a risk taker, but I just floated around and did my own thing till I vibed with some townies and told them my situation. Flattery is key! They were super friendly and we ended up sticking together the rest of the weekend! Gained some Snapchat followers. All win wins.</TEXT>

They love to mosh every 30 mins and its exhausting slash not enjoyable. I've never been Tomorrowland, but it's on my bucket list and the production is insane. EDC Las Vegas had better production than Ultra Europe, hands down 100 percent. GO TO TLAND!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm on the fence!!!! HELP ME CONFIRM OR DENY :) **\*\*background story\*\*** \- have my BA in public relations, i'm 30 years old \- moved to nyc from chicago for a job about 4 mo before covid hit \- job security during covid was 110%, all the reassurance i wasn't going to lose it \- my manager sits in the UK, so v hands off and no micromanagement \- flex schedule \- i don't HATE the people i work with, i've worked with worse \- pay grade is higher than average for my role (work in social media analytics), but still not in the six figs ;( i feel like most 30 year olds make 100K+ now a days \+++ **\*current situation\*** \- one of my job perks is that they pay for $10K of your tuition in a calendar year, let me elaborate more...they pay up to $5250 for free and then after that amount up to 10K gets taxed.. do you think that could get expensive? \- i've applied and got accepted into a masters program at WVU - data marketing communications, which i think would be amazing to guide me in some behind the scenes projects i could work on and present to my team that i can say ive been working on to better our performance and results \- there's another job i'm thinking about applying for at the moment that would get me a 20K raise but i have hesitations about starting a new job during covid (AND THEY DON'T OFFER THIS TUITION ASSITANCE PERK) \- i hate to be that person who jumps to a new job every year, so i think committing a couple more years at my job by locking in this degree would be beneficial for the long run regardless # **Is dedicating another two years of going back to school part time worth the degree?** **\*conflicting thoughts\*** \- i've never had an employer that offers this kind of perk, so i should take advantage of it!!?? i would never be able to afford another degree without this perk \- it'll make me more marketable and competitive for any future job opps \- i'm wondering if when i follow through and get the degree, will my work give me a generous raise?? my work never ASKED me to go back to school, it was all on a whim and figured i could leverage this degree for a promotion/raise later on down the road? idk how to have that conversation with my manager?? \*\*any advice on this topic would be appreciated!!\*\* \- i'll have to commit to this job until spring 2023, so i'll have funding to complete the degree \- i have to stay at my job for another 6 months after i finish the degree \- i have to pay for all 10 courses upfront (about 2K each) and then submit my grade at the end (u have to get a C or higher in order to get the reimbursement)... this i'm not too afraid about but just annoying it comes OOP from me first</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently about to check out at "Blinds To Go," but the $30 fee for shipping rubbed me the wrong way. They currently have a good deal going on \*\*BOGO\*\* which I'm able to get four pairs of blinds for \~$220... but can we do better than that?? Is there another blinds factory that's cheaper? OR has anyone bought blinds from a retailer and had a good experience??

    <TITLE>EXCESSIVE NITRO FOAM??</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-11 10:34:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, this has happened to me \*\*twice\*\* now... I've had no problems ordering the nitro cold brew ahead of time through the app and showing up and it being perfect. barely no foam. all nitro. smooth. nutty. all the flavor. BAM. instant love. the past two times i've gone to Dunkin and got their nitro... they've been filling it up like halfway cold brew and half nitro FOAM. FOAM!!! F.O.A.M... like i'm not here for that... Did they enforce new rules on foam? The associate proceeded to tell me that nitro and their regular cold brew come from the same tank, so just order a cold brew next time if i want all coffee. if you order nitro you're getting foam.... and i'm like well.. can i do half nitro cold brew and half reg cold brew and no foam?? LOL like... what?? anyway, he proceeded to do that and now it's just a bad combo. has anyone else had this problem? if starbucks can let users select their foam settings in their app why can't dunkin?? ... that's all :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LOL I'm going on a whim and seeing if I can install them myself...It's seems pretty easy from the directions on Amazon... Not sure what style you're looking for, but I wanted some that were not the standard aluminum (tried to stay away from TOO cheap), but not also not too expensive... so I ended up with these ones: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083N3KT1X/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083N3KT1X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1)</TEXT>
