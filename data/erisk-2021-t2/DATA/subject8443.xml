    <TEXT>Sorry if someone else has posted this btw, long time lurker, new redditor. With Pierce suddenly missing, the darkest and prime timelines are evenly matched. And who's Chang been talking to on the phone? What if he's in cahoots with the Darkest Timeline? What if as dark as Chang IS and can be in the prime timeline...the direct reflection of that would be Kevin, would it not? I don't think Abed thinking about what's going on in those other timelines is a throwaway gag...I think it's really happening for real. Evil Abed tried and failed alone. Chang went full tilt nuts and failed. Something tells me Chang is trying again, only this time with the help of the darkest timeline. I think the writers mean to Moffat us.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hear me out. A theory regarding The Doctor's numbers...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-11-19 20:09:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I remember hearing William Hartnell claim that he was in his seventh regeneration once. I don't know if I misheard that or what exactly, but if that's the case then Stephen Moffat is an absolute genius. Hartnell is 7 and died spending a regeneration to become Peter Troughton's 2nd Doctor (8). Had a forced regeneration into Pertwee. For the sake of this theory let's assume a forced regeneration is essentially a 1Up. So given that, Pertwee is still the second doctor with a new look. Regenerates into Tom Baker (9), Davison (10), Baker (11), McCoy (12) and the 13th regeneration and final, according to Time Lord law, life of The Doctor being Paul McGann. We saw him die in Night of the Doctor and then brought back to life and forced to regenerate. During that regeneration he ends the time war, does away with the Time Lords and regenerates into a new 1st Doctor, Christopher Eccleston. But I also might have put that together mostly from sugar packets too...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Casting People From Other Shows To Be Panelists on my New Show</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-01-17 19:13:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Introduction**: Ryan, of the Jerks Podcast, here. I am reaching out to anyone interested in cross promotion who'd like to sit in as a panelist on a show I'm putting together. **Concept**: 2 players create fighters based on a hand of cards dealt to them randomly. The players really don't have much of a role, outside of deciding what's being played. A panel of 4 debates and discusses who has the upper hand through two rounds and decides a winner after a third round. Round 1 is just the character, Round 2 adds a Power, Round 3 lets the player add a Problem to their opponent. **Offer**: Let me know if you'd be available on a Monday at around 6pm eastern time to come in via google hangouts to be a panelist. You'll get two opportunities to promote your show/project/whatever at the beginning and end of the show. Recording time would probably never be more than an hour. All I ask in return is that you tweet out that the episode you're on has gone live so the fans of your show can hear you. Interested? e-mail me at ryan@jerkspodcast.com</TEXT>

For about 2 months that was it but lately he's been getting pumped to see The Shield, Randy Orton, and Emma too. Frankly I can't wait to teach him Bo Dallas puns.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Smarks Against Humanity</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-04-24 18:22:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm putting up some money to make an unofficial wrestling-themed expansion for Cards Against Humanity. Previously, I've added just names of uber-famous figures into my CAH deck and they go over well. Well, now I'd like to go a step further and make a deck to mix in for when I play with my fellow smarks. I'm thinking 75-100 white cards (answers) and 35-50 black cards (questions) After spending time all over looking for where to leave this call for help, it became clear to me that this is the only place to come. So what I need from you is suggestions for morbid and borderline offensive wrestling jokes. If you've played Cards Against Humanity, you know what I'm looking for. If not, head over to r/cardsagainsthumanity to see what I mean. Thanks in advance! EDIT: WOW!! Thanks for all the good vibes for the project! And all the help! I'm working on editing out doubles and updating with the current complete lists. Keep the suggestions flowing!</TEXT>

Did you see Mojo Rawley get his head kicked off at Takeover? How about Xavier Woods at Arrival? The man puts heads in the cheap seats for Christ's sake and you're all waiting for him to flop and be relegated to gimmicky tag matches with Santino. Fuck that. The dude is a McMahon wet dream and all this Russian grandstanding is going to pay off somewhere. But I'm just trying to remain optimistic. I'm not ready to lose Lana.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His whole attitude doesn't seem genuine. I look at John Cena on the entry ramp and I see a guy selling his gear. When he holds up those little towels that's basically him whispering in your ear "BUY MY STUFF!" His matches are mostly predictable. I really enjoyed the Bray Wyatt stuff because it wasn't AS predictable. His one on one matches with Bray were less predictable than a seven man ladder match. He's a Dyson vacuum and the momentum of new talent is dirt. Lastly, he made that dumb fucking face at Money in the Bank when he won used it to face the Rock AGAIN to overcome "the odds" AND ANOTHER THING</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hadn't been interested in a wrestling game since WWF No Mercy on the N64. WWE 2K14 came around and I picked it up, 2K is doing a pretty solid job on the franchise. We'll see how 15 shapes up, but I can't imagine the mechanics will be a HUGE departure from previous installments. Pre-ordering is $5. If you see things and hear things you don't like leading up to the release, cancel. But put down $5 to make sure if you buy it you get the Stinger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One portrayed a beloved character that slowly bled into film and when film became the new path, he stopped calling himself that characters name. He shifted from face to heel from time to time but was always cheered for the most part. But he gradually left, leaving for a bit and coming back, and then leaving for longer periods of time and coming back part time occasionally, if at all. The other left us abruptly at what is arguably the precipice of his popularity and popular acceptance. People identified with him because he, really, was a fan first at heart and we saw that and loved that he cared enough about the business to shake it up. There was no gradual exit. Just...pick up and go. Which stings, but left us all clamoring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does make sense. It helps to create a series of matches between the two and push them both in right direction. For Bo it shows that he doesn't like to lose and holds a grudge against the people who do beat him. For R-Truth it showed us that just because R-Truth is coming down doesn't mean a squash match is imminent anymore. Him winning by roll up is him "taking" as Xavier Woods encouraged. And Bo's retaliation on Smackdown is telling of his mean streak.</TEXT>

Wandering to far off places, whimsical fields overlapping into the horizon full of fantastic creatures and pure unadulterated adventure. Wandering to distant planets in the deep reaches of space unexplored by Earth's satellites and shuttles, full of alien life and thrilling heart stopping danger. Wandering right around the corner and back in time to tell stories untold about rogues and gunslingers never remembered and too often forgotten. Wandering into a subreddit...full of like minds, sharing themselves in just one paragraph at a time. He types "An Introduction."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Starting a Wrestling Podcast...Need Advice From the Target Audience</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-08-26 13:37:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>It recently came to my attention that as far as being a wrestling fan in my circle of friends goes...I am alone. As someone who's got the podcasting bug and can't seem to stop creating shows and content I've found a friend who is a prime willing candidate for an idea I've had for a while. Introduce someone who is a clueless non-fan to the rich, televised history of the sport. Rather than going chronologically I was thinking about doing a Past/Present/Future type of presentation of matches. Three per episode with a light sprinkling of related (or unrelated) promos and backstage spots. And then the show would be thoughts, questions, and comments on what was witnessed. What I'm looking for is, should I just stick to randomly selecting matches for each show, should I highlight a specific wrestler each week or both? Let me know your thoughts on this or how I could approach this and make it the best product I can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sadly it may be a while, if ever, before we see X-Men or even The Fantastic Four. Marvel recently announced No More Mutants and the cancellation of the Fantastic Four title, and has also pulled the rights to make action figures of the first family. Some think this is Disney playing puppet master in a strong handed bid to not advertise Fox's movie and help it tank at the box office, giving them a new reason to hand it back over. Meanwhile, they're hoping that removing all mutant abilities (just like in House of M) will do the same for the upcoming Apocalypse film. So, while mutants would be AWESOME, sadly they're a long way off, if ever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, I am mad at the fans who caused it. The asinine rules didn't have anything to do with personal boundaries or anything...but I suppose if they were rules that were imposed and not enforced which lead to infractions, then I could see them tightening up on all policies and not just a handful to treat one specific issue. Edit: The rules: "NXT Universe, moving forward all Meet  amp; Greets will be limited to the first 100 people to arrive. You will also be limited to ONE autographed item per Superstar, and photos of Meet  amp; Greet will ONLY be taken by NXT Live! staff." Whiiiiiiiich I get. There's been some complaining by people about getting multiple photos for all of their kids, etc and when the world complains, problems tend to seem worse. Won't go back on what I said because I already said it, but I've got a clearer grasp and understanding without all the screaming and shouting around it.</TEXT>

They say they help you find work after the program, but work comes to you through networking with others and working on projects. The more projects and extra curriculars you put your hands into and help to make better, the better people are going to learn your name and skills. However they also put you in front of some really important people in the fields you're going into. And those interactions help too.

    <TEXT>So, after a PPV main event or, hell, even a match is made in the WWE we begin to be subjected to 11 varieties of those matches. Right now we've been watching the same 8 or 9 guys go at it against each other since before Survivor Series. I can't be the only one sick to death of watching my PPV matches before the PPV. I seem to remember a time when the opponents would be, sometimes forcibly, held back from physically interacting with each other. They'd strut out during each other's matches and cause distractions and we'd get killer promos and when they finally went head to head it felt like it meant something. Take for example Zayn/Neville which has been building this month. We got to see Sami take Adrian to school in the first week of November's NXT. Adrian sustained an injury to get one over on Sami and win the match, and has been milking it since. We've only seen them since on the mic. And there is nothing I want more right now than to see this match happen. WCW used this tactic a lot and their main events were some of the best in terms of build and hype. Pay off maybe not so much all the time (save for Halloween Havoc '96 where Savage dons Hogan's wig). tl;dr STOP SHOWING ME MY PPV MATCHES ON RAW AND SMACKDOWN</TEXT>

Further more, if you remove the letters, E,T,R, and K from the word NETWORK, you're left with N, W, and O. New World Order. EVEN FURTHER MORE! $9.99, if you flip that upside down what do you have? Sixty-six six. SIX SIX SIX. 666. The number of the beast. I know these things because I see through the bullshit. I alone am far more well informed than you, mere reader. Mere wrestling aficionado.

    <TEXT>"Since its creation, the championship's history and reigns are often confused with other titles primarily because the championship does not bear the name of its designated organization. Contributing to this is the common usage of the terms "world championship" or "world heavyweight championship" in general for all acknowledged world titles. This results in allusions often being made to other titles including those of WCW and the NWA, amalgamating the history of this championship with the history of the belt that represents it.[9][10] As affirmed by WWE, the World Heavyweight Championship is not a continuation of the WCW Championship, but rather its successor by way of the WWE Undisputed Championship, just as the WCW Championship spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Due to its relation to both titles, its lineage is connected with the earliest recognized world heavyweight championship.[11] On the July 1, 2013 edition of Raw, WWE honored previous World Heavyweight champions, and included former NWA World Heavyweight and WCW World Heavyweight champions including Lou Thesz and Ric Flair, indicating it is considered by the WWE the successor of those titles."

    <TEXT>Losing on the way out is typically the best way to go. You go out fighting and you're passing the torch to the next guy(s). If you're going to beat the guys that are going to be elevated, then why are they being elevated? Bo Dallas' exit was the best ever. Some of these tag teams are compromised of guys who are strong in certain areas, but not in others. Partnering Sin Cara with Kalisto after Rodriguez was let go did awesome things for Hunico (who's under the Sin Cara mask, if you didn't already know) Hunico couldn't get himself over if he tried and it took dropping the wife beater/khakis cholo gimmick to do it, and he's been actually entertaining instead of a botch machine. Sometimes a gimmick only works to a small audience and it needs to be changed or altered to appeal to more than around 400 hardcore fans. An example of not changing much going poorly is Bo Dallas. The gimmick worked when he was working a small audience. But without the aide of backstage vignettes or any mic time at all in the lower card, the gimmick gets stale. He was on to something congratulating his losers on his victory, but Mark Henry ran him over and I fear the day he comes back and has to face mid card Big Show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not 100% sure this should go here, but it's my best guess. I'm launching a weekly live stream of WWE 2k15 on twitch.tv tonight at 10pm eastern time. The catch here is that all the wrestlers in the show are depicted by the men behind the CAWs cutting promos throughout the week leading up to the show. No WWE talent, just some happenstance that I can't get rid of this time around (no custom arenas :\) The stream will be just that, a stream of the fights. Over the weekend we'll add commentary and compile all the promos from the week and the footage from the stream into a show. If this is something you'd be interested to check out you can find the links below.

    <TEXT>It's a wrestling game. And that's what I wanted, and that's what I have. The bells and whistles aren't there because it's laying the ground work. 2k16 I expect to be much bigger in the realm of storylines, customization, and depth. It's obnoxious that you can't make original Divas sure. And the MyCareer Mode is missing a ton of career points anyone would want to work through. Royal Rumble entrant, King of the Ring, etc. I managed to get into Team Cena for Survivor Series but it wasn't even an elimination match. There is SO much power in these new consoles we should be able to do the classic 5v5. In summation: More match types, more options, BEARDS, Tag Team Career, Divas Career, Singles Career that doesn't JUST make you go after the top titles, and also check out what I've been able to do with the game on twitch and youtube [Luchapocalypse!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41ZSNgt1BZjlbU0dGPzz-zfKK3ei8-9W)</TEXT>

Recently she took up some new age hippie spirituality thing and explained to me how our sons behavior, which she knows nothing about, seems identical to how they describe "crystal children" I could only sit back and let my mouth hang agape.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Infinity and Beyond</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-12 12:40:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got really excited about the prospect of Disney Infinity when it was first announced. I had just found out that my (now ex)wife and I were having our first child and as a Disney Person I had to collect every single bit of this game and it's toys to share with my son when he was old enough. He's 3 now and we goof around in the toybox. He switches the characters out every 30 seconds and after about 10 minutes there's an army that's moved from their toybox to the coffee table. His favorites are Hulk, Woody, and Jack Skellington. I've built race tracks, playgrounds, and adventures in the toybox with just what was available to me and, while I haven't shared any of them with the community, they exist at least on my hard drive for my son and I to play. it really makes me sad that something I really loved collecting is going away so suddenly. I'm proud to say that it's the first thing I set forth to actively collect that I've completed up to current and (plan to complete with the Finding Dory and Alice sets) I put in actual effort and real time hunting down and finding every single power disc and have no actual means of storing anything but the Marvel ones. (Seriously, someone help me figure out what to do with this mountain of plastic) The last thing for me to do is replace the Ahsoka figure that got damaged in playtime by little fingers that like to pull things apart and complete the set. But I'll keep building. I'll keep playing. I'll keep it around because at the end of the day, it's something my son and I can share.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shared an apartment in mid 2000s. I lost my job and couldn't afford it so I moved out and continued to contribute what I could. He let others use my bed and room while I wasn't there for god only knows what. The lease came up, I moved my stuff out and moved back in with my folks and we just didn't talk anymore. I read a couple years later that I'd been written off entirely and that stung because we were genuinely good friends until the apartment happened. We're friends on Facebook again now, almost 10 years after the apartment. Life took us in opposite directions and there's not much left of what made us friends in high school. But we'll message each other randomly to share things that remind of old times. That's about it though.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-05 13:08:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, here's the situation; I've been a Rock Band enthusiast since RB1. I threw down money for everything. New DLC, new peripherals, the stage kit even. 1200+ DLC in all between the Network and the DLC Store. This was all...on XBox 360. Fast forward to Harmonix announcing Rock Band 4 and I'm head over heels for the announcement but some time has passed and I've switched to PS4. I never exported anything in the time frame they provided to have the credentials to download any of the exports listed in the title. I've contacted support a few times and I keep getting the auto response of how I had 5 years to export the games previously so if I didn't I'm out of luck, when I never owned them or a Playstation prior to that cut off date anyway. All in all, I just want to be able to get the tracks from these three games onto RB4 and when in doubt, reddit. Any advice, help, whatever is appreciated. Rock On.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See, that explains it to me so much better than "You had five years, sorry." I understand this. Sidenote: If someone I know were to log into my PS4 with their account that DOES have access to these exports, would I be able to play them after downloading them without their account logged in or would I need to have them logged in all the while?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm trying to work around having to do that since I've already sunk money into buying new DLC and peripherals for PS4. On top of that when Online releases, the people I want to be able to play with are all on Playstation anyway, so getting an XBox One for ONLY Rock Band is counterproductive. But I have considered this option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I figured that cross platform wasn't going to happen, which is why I started buying DLC that I had already had. I immediately bought copies of the games to GET codes to do the exports but 1. didn't have a PS3 and 2. didn't have access to one through another person at the time. So now those are sitting in their shrink wrap in a hope chest. Because I keep HOPING this will work out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been lurking in here for advice for months. I was more prominent a few years ago trying to lend advice where I could but soon realized my own show was suffering from me not taking my own advice. ANYWAY...I've got a brand new rig, and a brand new show, and I'm glad to be active again. The new show is a fictional story-telling podcast that uses a revolving cast of players and the framework of the Fiasco RPG to create stories. I take on the role of a narrator that walks the listener from scene to scene and everything else is completely made up on the spot when we record. I've got the bug again and I'm excited to share my work again. So please, check us out at http://www.cnbchronicles.com and let me know if you rate and review on iTunes so I can return the favor! Thanks everyone!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Telling My Son About His Mom</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-28 15:17:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a single father of a four year old and he's had an on again off again relationship with his mother. I have full custody but have been lenient with letting her have him over her house based on the treatment of her mental health issues. Things were fine until she stopped asking to see him out of the blue, I inquired about her status and was told she was manic and off her meds and not in a state to see him and this only seemed to get worse. Now she's manipulating 3 different people with different versions of a story. She tells me she's anorexic and dying, she tells her mom she's moving to Arizona and she tells her father a combination of the two. So it's clear to me, right now, that she's lying to someone and I think it's me and our son and she wants us to believe she's going to be dead. He got used to going to see her every other weekend and now that it's abruptly stopped he is asking about her, I've only really been able to tell him she's sick and I don't think he could totally comprehend the tale she wants me to believe. So what do I tell him to get his mind off of her?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exact same experience here. No ones carrying it, target site says it's out of stock and not sold in stores, I found 5 discover packs and 3 playlists when I went in yesterday, going to a different one today to see if I can clean them out too. Had game night last night and we played this for 3 hours straight and the last portion of that was sitting in a little circle in my living room playing around in freestyle mode, if you get this in front of people they're going to fall in love with it. I've been posting videos of mixes on my Facebook page all week and people are clammoring to experience it. But again, store staffs knew nothing. Every store rolled it out on their own time and stock seemed to be sold out before it was even available.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on a Sandbox Mode</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-16 20:52:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>There's been a lot of chatter about it lately and it was something I meant to post about over the weekend after handing the controller over to my son. Could this game sustain a sandbox mode? Sort of like FarCry 5's arcade, or Halo 3s the Forge prior to that. Ideally it'd be a mode of unlimited resources and map materials. Scenery, props, plants, everything and players could create their own scenarios and upload them to a community. I know all my kid wants to do is get in and build and he doesn't care about saving the world or battling royally, he just wants to build and sometimes, on the rare occasion I do too, but I have the patience to go in and farm the mats and waste them by constructing a massive wood phallus over the ATLAS. But I'd also get a charge out of creating a maze of traps and dead ends and wandering husks that I could upload for the community to play. I dunno, this game really seems like it could BE anything and that's one of the reasons I bought in before the initial Early Access launch, seeing it become a 100 Man PvP game really got the gears turning about what else this could be, and I really think Sandbox is the next door to open.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>With Baseball Season Approaching...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-04 12:15:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>"If you build it..." I was talking to a friend this morning about what sports teams exist in the world of Fortnite and we started rattling off team names and that steam rolled into this, what we thought was a, brilliant idea for a series of costumes, emotes, sprays, a location, the build up for the location. So without further ado; **The Baseball Season** * In the weeks leading up to a newly redesigned location, you start to hear ghoulish murmurs around Fatal Fields. The close you get the clearer they become, if you're standing right on the location where the change will be made it's crystal clear and all it's saying is "If you build it..." * Fatal Fields becomes Fatal Field. A farm house and barn with a corn maze, home made baseball diamond complete with dug outs and concession house, and an unnamed section close by with a sign distinguishing it as Community Pool * Several skin ideas came up in this conversation including The Spooky Slugger, a reanimated base ball player wearing a dirty pin stripe uniform. There were 4 teams discussed and a skin for each would be where to go from here The Plankerton Bush Wookies, Junk Junction Rust Lords, Loot Lake Leviathans, and Canny Valley Cupids, they'd sport modern baseball uniforms with mock color schemes based on real world teams. The last skin idea was for a Loot Lake Leviathan Mascot, which is a foam head version (i.e Tomato Head) of The Leviathan skin that already exists in a baseball uniform. * Emotes: The one emote we discussed was having a hologram or even ethereal bat appear in the players hands and they point to "the fences" a la Babe Ruth. * Sprays: I'm sure there are a thousand spray ideas to fill in here as with any topic, but mostly, a "You're Killin' Me Smalls" is what I want to see with this set. It's a tall order, it's a lofty dream. But some fields are built on dreams.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My first two negative player experiences</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-14 20:31:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I'm trying to finish up my Plankerton missions and head into the next part of the game, so aside from doing actual survivor finding and encampment clearing I'm looking for these anomalies too. I like to share the wealth sometimes, so whenever I find a supply llama I'll find someone to bring it to and share it with them. This lead me to my first problem. My very first AFKer. Boxed in, in the middle of the street, I took out one of the walls to find them running in circles. What's worse is that they weren't even AFK. When I took the wall down I used the chat feature to ask them to help or leave. and they put up their wall and replied "nah" and continued on. Reported, not that anything gets done about this. Second thing, Holy crap these children playing this game. Two of them carried on for 10 minutes about accidentally dropping a weapon, and getting it back. "Give it back I'll give you something better" "If you can make something better then why not just do that?" on and on and on and on on the voice chat. Until one of them gave up and bailed on the mission. I did the stormchest myself, built the ATLAS base and protected it alone and am afraid to go into another Play with Others session now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dear Friends Desperately In Need of Help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-17 16:55:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I've got these two friends that used to be neighbors and since moving away we've stayed good friends and if I could help them myself, I'd give them the world. But, alas, I cannot. Adam and Angel have four kids now and have been without a stable home for almost a year. Adam suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and it's taken a lot from him, but he perseveres for his kids and wife. He's got a bit of a hot streak, but you would too if the world has treated you the way it has them for the last few years. I guess it started when Angel lost her job over a harassment complaint that she made while employed with AutoZone. They found a place to live taking care of Adam's long-time family friend, who gave them a roof and plenty of space to live while Angel tried to find work. She looked, and looked and looked and looked and looked and for almost a year nothing at ALL came back. That man who let them stay with him soon passed and it was hard on Adam, it was hard on both of them but his mother let them stay in the house as long as they needed. A few months passed and that invitation was quickly revoked and actions to get them off the property began. None made in an official capacity until they filed suit with the city to have them forcibly removed from the premises. Angel turned to her family and they all turned their backs. Adam too. After a few weeks bouncing around motel rooms thanks to various Salvation Army locations and other organizations, they found a place to hunker down for a little while. Unfortunately, the man running the place was creating his own rules, lying to the benefactors about the way he was running it, and was trying to enforce religion on the people he was letting in. Not your typical, stand up sit down stand up sit down catholic mass either. This was "YOU'RE WICKED AND BEING PUNISHED UNLESS YOU GIVE YOURSELF TO GOD NOW!" church. But...they endured. They formulated a plan to get what money they could together and drive to Tennessee. They arranged meetings with the department of housing, arranged a back-up plan with friends in that area and two days before they were to leave, the guy running the place they were staying at tried to kick them out. They had an angel that day and got their last couple days under a roof and headed to Tennessee. The story here is so much LARGER and messed up than I went into detail on. it really deserves its own attention. So they've made it to Tenn and have hit the same wall they faced in here in Florida. Angel has been out pounding the pavement looking for work, putting in the applications and getting nowhere for it. Adam has been taking care of four kids in a motel room. The Housing department has got absolutely no news for them and the last I spoke to them they've run out of quarters to do laundry with and are wearing dirty clothes now to boot. They've given up dogs that they loved and had a cousin come through so that the kids could have a Christmas this past year. I don't even know what they've done for the kids on their birthdays. They just keep getting dirt kicked in their face and if I could do anything to help them myself I would but I have my own troubles to deal with. This subreddit was set up for assistance and these people NEED your assistance. They've tried everything and work HARD to make what little they have work and it hurts to see my friends that I love struggle so hard. If you've made it this far, please consider helping. If you'd like to, please PM me and I will give you what information you need.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[LFA] Young Half Elf Ranger with Owlbear companion (possibly rest of party at artist's preference)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-20 18:10:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, I am teaching my son to play D amp;D. Incorporating life lessons, school work, using our imaginations and creativity to figure out problems, and all that into the sessions to make it as fun and educational as possible. We've been playing for a month or so and he's done SO well I want to surprise him with a portrait of his character (and maybe his friends and rivals he's met so far.) His character, Benduin, is a young (equivalent of a human 10 year old), Half-Elf with a draconic streak somewhere in his family's past. This streak appears physically as a portion of his face over his right eye is red scales instead of skin and his right eye is a green dragon eye (similar to Todoroki from My Hero Academia, his favorite character). He has a pet Owlbear, Desmond, who (due to some harsh rolls when he's needed most) much prefers to play in the flowers and with small woodland critters than do his part in battle. He's got the demeanor of a golden retriever... Anyway, if you need any other information I'm happy to provide it. Below I'll give basics on the rest of the party if you choose to go that route. Okt - Male Verdan Blind Drunken Master Monk. Knot - Male Satyr Barbarian who looooooves his giant axe. Snottgas - Female (purple) Kobold Druid. Again, if more details are needed, I'm happy to provide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, I got back into collecting vinyl about two years ago, my girlfriend and I have a weekly routine of going to our favorite shops and shopping the new releases and the rest of their selection and usually walk out spending far FAR too much. I have no idea what I #8217;m doing, I #8217;ve got an audio technica permanently synced up to some Logitech gaming speakers with LEDs in the back (G560, for those interested) My collection is a combination of what you read above, a year of receiving three selections a month from vnyl.org, and an inherited treasure trove of classic rock that a friend was letting go. I literally just found this subreddit and never thought to tap reddit for a community for my hobby. Glad I found y #8217;all!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been around vinyl my whole life and this is basically evidence of it while also being a testament to how deep my love for all things Henson goes. I found out through Discogs that this was a promotional item from back when the show was hot. No idea where we got it. All I remember is clapping like a circus seal every time I heard the words  #8220;Down in Fraggle Rock! #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Mount Dora, FL there is a small flea market riddled with people of the soil. But far beyond that...this place is called Reningers Flea Market. My good friend operates a booth where he sells t-shirts he screen prints in his garage. While visiting he told me about Tommy. Tommy is this old hippie that sells vinyl and he has an AMAZING selection, I spent damn near 200 on Elvis purchases for my fanatic Aunt. I digress, my girlfriend and I walked over and started perusing. Moments later seemingly out of nowhere this old hippie strumming a mandolin appears and asks what we #8217;re looking for. I told him about my aunt and I told him that we kind of just know what we want when we see it and he says  #8220;well I like you man so I #8217;m gonna show you some cool stuff. #8221; And then he started breaking out treasure after treasure after treasure. Sealed Elvis Presley picture discs, this blue vinyl Beatles album from the year of release, The Million Dollar Quartet...the dude had a story about everything and I can #8217;t wait to see him again. And the coolest thing is that he remembered me and brought an Elvis record presses on gold vinyl to my friends booth for me to pick up next time I came around. This has become the best hobby. I #8217;ve made some awesome new friends and acquaintances from hunting alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ever since I started collecting two years ago one of my goals was to collect Weezer #8217;s studio catalog the majority of which was super easy. Save for Raditude, hardly their best album, hardly my favorite either, but otherwise out of print. I was uneasy about using Discogs, but we had some success with it otherwise recently so my girlfriend made the purchase for me as an early Father #8217;s Day gift from her and my son.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Top three are Maladroit, Red, and Blue I acknowledge the trope of  #8220;anything but blue album or Pinkerton is trash #8221; or whatever but I love that the band grows and evolves across their time together and Red was special I think because they tried so many things on one album and it was fun to take in the story behind each track as well as the track itself Maladroit I like because it was the first album after they replaced the original bassist and I just remember being a young man vibing with Keep Fishing and I have a lot of pleasant memories with all of these songs</TEXT>
