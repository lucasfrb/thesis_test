    <TEXT>NTA, maybe worth sitting them down and talking about it all? Ask why she expects you to put towards, My mum always taught me from a young age "never expect anything for free" Does daughter get any allowance she can put towards? I don't know what it's like over there, but here I had a part time job at the age of 14 and started paying for my own things, at the age of 16 I had two jobs outside of school hours and helped out at home for some extra pocket money, can she not get a part time job? Or offer some chores at home so she can earn it? Don't let them hang this over your head and if she throws a hissy over it, she/the relationship isn't worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA, I call this the "family tax" when working/helping family and they take the p*ss, you get paid as a standard employee so that's what you are, if he wants you to stay etc he should pay you for doing so as he would have to a 'standard employee' do you have a contract? Or is it just a verbal agreement? Everyone has a life outside of work, just because he's family, doesn't mean he can treat you like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree, no one but the bride should wear white, even if the bride has a coloured dress it's just something that shouldn't be done, she wore it knowing she'd be getting looks/attention which seems like it's what she wanted, I would of kicked her out as soon as I saw her in that dress, she had her day this was OP's, if she was that bothered that they had the same cake etc she should of waited until a few days after and address how it made her feel but seems like she was just after the drama anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 5-4-3-2-1 method, it's a good way to ground yourself and is also used in CBT therapy I believe, I got taught it in school to help during exams if I felt overwhelmed, it also helps take your mind off rapid breathing so that settles down as well, once I've calmed down I take myself away from the situation where possible for 10 mins, 5 things you can see 4 things you can touch 3 things you can hear 2 things you can smell 1 thing you can taste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First time poster, on mobile so please forgive any mistakes, I'm out of the relationship now but it still has effects on me and my mind, I was with him for 5 years, in that time he abused me in many ways, coercive control is one of them, among with sexual abuse, some nights I'd wake up (heavy sleeper) and he'd be doing things and wouldn't stop when I said no, if I tried to move away he'd stop me (bigger and stronger than me) from these incidents I started to have panic attacks in my sleep, if I move whilst I'm asleep and the quilt touched my leg unexpectedly, I wake up being unable to breathe and crying, it's been nearly 2 years since I got emergency removed (took over a year for them to believe me) and even though they arent as common, they still happen, I don't like talking to people about irl, even my current SO doesn't know all of it (There's more) he understands and helps calm me down but I just want them to stop, has anyone else had these? If so have you got any coping methods that you can suggest?</TEXT>

I'm not a fan of my birthday for this reason, it always gets forgotten by family, only one or two of my friends remember and usually its obligatory fb post from them (live miles away, I'm Yorkshire, ones Lincolnshire other is Sussex) I take myself away for the day and have a me day, this year I took myself to Sheffield and to one of the valleys there and just walked and walked, it was cold and wet but it was good to just have a day to clear my mind of thoughts and take myself away from all the hustle and bustle of the town I live in, unfortunately I had to come home earlier than expected due to me being a clutz and fell in the valley and walking in wet shoes and socks was not comfy lol, sometimes you need time alone to find yourself and refresh your mind and get some new perspective, travelling alone can be good, you'll come across challenges and new people who will help bring you out of your shell whilst you find yourself and who you truly are, hope travelling goes well for you and that you're wrapped up warm, it's cold tonight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always worry that if I keep asking them to do things they'll stop coming round and then that's on me, their last SM was horrible to them to the point that they didn't see their dad because of her, I just can't figure out where to place the line for them to not cross before I flip out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It maybe worth giving citizens advice a call or pop to an open morning as they can direct you to reccomended family solicitors and ones where you can get a free appointment so you know roughly what will happen next, I don't think they will be open much over the christmas period and unfortunately if you go to a drop in you maybe sat for a while so the earliest you can get there the better, I'm also in the UK and have had to go to them for advice myself before in regards to family law, thankfully for you over here grandparents don't have rights and I'm sure once the evidence has been put forward in any legal setting they won't have a chance and your sons dad will struggle whilst he is under their roof, if you need anymore advice for citizens advice or need help finding anyone, or even just for a rant I'm more than happy to help/listen if you need to.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-29 14:14:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure if I'll be able to get any advice but thought I'd try, me and my 'husband' have been separated for nearly 6 years, we have an 8yr old son together, I was the one who left him, I left my son living with him and his parents due to me having no where to go, no family and would of been put in hostels by the local council, I didn't want to put our son through that as I didn't want to unsettle him, over the years he has stopped me using our son if he disagrees with something for example one year me and my friend went on holiday over his (ex's) birthday in April, I had discussed it the previous December that I thought he would want to spend time with him on his birthday as he had requested over previous years and he agreed, the day I was due to fly out he kicked off and stopped me seeing him for 3 weeks after I got back 4 days later, he hasn't done so for about 3-4years but I'm scared that he will do it again. My problem is that on christmas and our sons birthday he changes how things are, we agreed last year that I would have him for his birthday and he would he at his dads for christmas and change it round this year and keep to it for years to come, this was so I could visit my family over christmas for the first time in 10 years amd over 2 hours away as I was alone due to leaving a bad relationship to which he agreed, Christmas this year comes around, I'm still under the agreement thought that he would be with me all Christmas, 2 weeks before his dad said no and that he would be with me christmas afternoon and boxing day, a week before he changed it to that he's with me christmas eve and morning, giving his usual threats I didn't feel confident in arguing back as I didn't want him stopping access again, There is no legal paperwork for agreements and I'm wanting to get this drawn up with potentially having my son full time with him getting access (there is issues there that will help me in doing so but would take up another story) and to get a divorce, how do I go about this? I know it will be a lengthy battle and I'm fully prepared for the emotional and mental attacks I'll receive from him and his family, I just don't know who to contact for help, how to go forward or realistic costs of doing so. I apologise for any mistakes on this post as I'm on my phone. Edit: I live in Yorkshire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what I needed to hear thank you! I don't ask my son about anything when he's at his dads, we'll be talking about something completely different lole a tv programme or what to have for lunch and he'll randomly bring things up during conversation to which I try to brush over and go back to topic as quick as possible, I don't discuss things around him that can be taken back to his dads or that will put thoughts in his mind, these are discussed with my partner when he's at his dads or when he is in bed asleep, the relationship that I left over 2 years ago was bad for me, my son was never around or part of the reasons as to why it went wrong and his dad knows of nothing of why that relationship ended. I only want what's best for him, I have messages from his dad in regards the times he used to threaten/stop me seeing him, I have contacted citizens advice before and seen a solicitor and shown them messages and explained the best I could have to which they have told me it won't help him as it shows him as being petty for his reasoning, I just want my son to be happy and for us all to know where we stand on agreements legally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you go online to the CSA page there is a calculator, it will ask you for income, how many nights a year she stays at yours etc, use this as a guideline, if it's less I'd approach her mum with the screenshot of what it says and bring up the subject of how often she is with you and money, you cannot afford to fund both households if she's mainly at yours, as for her being in the living room all the time even for sleeping, that needs to stop, especially with a baby on the way, have you tried to sit her down and talk to her about how it's a living space and not a sleeping space? Ask if there is anything that's putting her off sleeping in her own bed, you need to set some boundaries ASAP because the more you put it off, the harder it becomes. Explain how you need some down time after work and that a film is for watching to be able to relax and still spend time together, is there any activities or after school clubs she could go to? That also could help with her need to be around people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If there's structural damage, I believe you can contact your local council, they will send someone out (when possible to do so under current lockdown) to check the damages over and take your landlords info, if they find it to be too badly damaged they can take it further on your behalf and also get in contact with the upstairs landlord, they can enforce them to do something about it within a timescale and if they don't they can be fined and more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to take the hit and say YTA, I understand where you're coming from, I have a very very unique name, even when I Google it there is nothing, it always gets pronounced incorrectly and I'm constantly asked what country I'm from and what language I talk and its pisses me off no end, I'm British and can only speak English, I'm always having to correct someone after telling them how to say it numerous times, but it's the name I was given by my mother, she died when I was 14, I had to change my last name legally at one point after her passing (long story) and I also considered changing ny first name, after a long time deciding I realised that it was a name she chose for me, after 16yrs I'm glad I kept my name as since then I've lost a lot of things that remind me of her, it's the one thing that I still get to feel close to her whilst remembering the conversations about why she chose my name, where it came from and what it means, your parents gave you your name for a reason, whether you like it or not there is worse things in life and I'm fully with her when she says she feels disrespected and upset that you have done this. You could of maybe done it and not told her, would she of ever of found out? You say your mother is a cunt and your father a spineless coward, it really seems to me you did this out of spite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If/when you receive it, return to seller, do not send to the other person, for them to wait until they have received the 2tb to then send you the 1tb is bs, this sounds like a scam to me as sending third party means you aren't covered by paypal/ebay and that you likely won't receive your order nor will you receive a refund due to it being sorted outside of ebay. It is the sellers mess up and responsibility to sort this out and pay postage not yours, I'd contact ebay in regards to cover your back and make them aware.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NAL but had previously worked for a car insurance provider, if you escalate it and ask them for a copy of your comparison quote (I can't remember the terminology they use) that they're basing this on, it can take a while to come through but it will prove that no conviction was added when you ran the quote, they cannot use an old quote for this policy if it was a different quote that you continued to create the policy with, any payments that are taken should be refunded to you once this has been rectified and any admin fee's refunded as well since it isn't you that made a change, in my previous employment they would send an email asking for the proof, a letter and a text msg at the same time giving you 14 days, and repeated again at 7 days, with 3 days to go they will again send you an email and a text, I'm not sure if other insurers are the same. It's not down the insurer to prove it, its down to yourself to prove otherwise. I apologise for formatting, I'm on mobile and half asleep.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My relationship, my OH was always on his feet but in retail so he would be in one spot or behind a desk helping someone, now he is home. I work nights in a physically demanding job, Previously I would get home as he was leaving, do what housework would need doing then climb in bed, wake up for when kids get home from school, cook food for when he got home, then go to work and do it all again, since he's been off work he's noticed how exhausted I am when I get back in the mornings, especially now as I've picked up extra hours/shifts when I can, he's also realised that working and doing household chores should be more equal between us, he's being more appreciative towards me and doing pretty much all the housework so I can relax when I get home/wake up (I still do the clothes washing and cook/clean on my days off) I'm hoping it doesn't revert back to previous ways when he's allowed back to work.</TEXT>

Say give him about a month or two, first 2 wks show him how to do laundry/dishwasher, look online for easy to follow recipes and have him read/watch as he goes along and cook a few times a week, or have him help you cook/clean so he sees how its done in your home, then give him a month with no guidance or guidelines to see if he's listened/learnt and then go from there, things need to be equal in a relationship/home, paying the extra rent whilst you do everything is not equal, if he fails or doesn't listen then you know how the rest of your relationship will be.

    <TEXT>Those UFO yogurts with toys in the middle, Iceland used to do chocolate flavoured peas and pizza flavoured carrots to try and get kids to eat them, I ate veggies anyway but those was amazing to me for some reason, there was also cartoonies, which was small round biscuits that had chocolate on the inside, there's similar packs out now but the biscuit just doesn't taste the same, panda pops seem non existent now same with twist and squeezes, Cadbury snow flakes, campino's, flipper dippers, and Mars delights, these made up my childhood and I'm gutted they aren't around anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did you ever link your xbox to your email account with its serial number? I recently did this out of curiosity to find out when/if my warranty had expired. Just an idea in case it does progress further and the police say that you'll get the xbox back and they get the money, that way you know for sure its your xbox and not one that they already had that had stopped working, to which they'd claim the faulty one is the one you sold. If they carry on tell them you have made the police aware and if they still feel like you 'scammed' them that you'd be more than happy to give them the incident number if they so wish, if it is a scam then they'll probably just give you some more abuse and disappear as they won't want police sniffing around especially if they are dodgy. Edit to add [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/18878/microsoft-xbox-device-registration-process) for device registration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Glad to hear! If it comes to it and you need it, at least you can prove its the same xbox, if you do end up having to trade back double check the xbox warranty seals haven't been broken and for any damage that may of happened, I'm assuming you still have the pics from the ad to show what condition it was in so it all helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But it shows the xbox has been linked to your account previously and is the correct xbox if they try and pull a switcheroo as you'll be able to check the serial number on the back of the xbox, you're not an idiot, not a lot of people think about these things, hopefully they'll leave you alone once they realise you aren't giving in, bonus is that you dropped it off and they didn't collect so they don't know where you live to continue the harassment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Missing trust fund? Where do I go from here?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-28 16:27:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not quite sure where to start if I have any legal stand or where to go for help on this matter, I apologise for any mistakes in my post, emotions are high and I'm a bit confused on what to do, So to start, my mum died when I was 14, I have only just got a copy of her will, I was to go to my uncle (mums brother) and his wife after her passing, they where appointed to be trustees of my mums estate and to divide it between me and my brother, I was to be able to access this when I turned 19, it states in the will that it was ' lt;20k' I have not heard nor seen anything about this trust fund, I'm not on good terms with said trustees as my aunt constantly blamed everything on me after I moved in, told people she couldn't cope with me and that I was a handful, she then shipped me off within 2wks of my mum passing to live with my nan, my uncle (I'll call him Uncle T) and his then partner (by packing my things when I was at school, picking me up after and dumping me at my nans, I was unaware this was to happen) My mum also stated in her will I was not to live with uncle T under any circumstances, I was a grieveing 14yr old who had been moved away from everyone and everything I knew the day after she passed (moved from north to south, at least 2hrs drive) marched up to the newsagents the day of moving to get a paper round and then the day after I was in a new school, I am now 30, do I have a leg to stand on if I decided to find out about if there is any trust that I am owed? How do I find out if there is in fact anything? My brother received nothing also. Again I'm sorry if nothing makes sense, its all a bit mushed in my mind and I'm still trying to process new found information in regards to this and other parts of my life since. Edit: forgot to add I live in England.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to work in a bookies, the amount of people who would come in and put their shrapnel in the machine (especially homeless) spin once or twice, then print the ticket out expecting notes back, the look on their faces when I gave them the money in the exact change they fed in to it was priceless (there's a back office machine that tells you exactly what coin and amount of said coin was entered) my favourite time was when someone put  #163;22 in change in the machine, played 3 20p spins, printed out  #163;21.40, just 20mins after opening so no one else had been in that machine, I had next to nothing in the till until the safe opened, so I emptied the machine, took 3 of the few 20ps that was there and tipped the rest of it on the counter, he was not impressed! Even if I had the change I would of done it the exact same way and have done many times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Worst for me was when EXMIL came to stay for 3 MONTHS!! She moved the cutlery around in the drawer, I'd put it back to how it was meant to be then she would do it again even when I snapped and told her to pack it in, also turned F1 over when I went to put the kettle on, I was out the room less than a minute but she found it 'boring' and put Britain's got talent rerun on, seems pretty tame compared to other comments.</TEXT>
