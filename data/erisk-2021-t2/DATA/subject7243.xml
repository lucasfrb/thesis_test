    <TITLE>Resiliance balance?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-18 19:12:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alrigthy, i made a reddit account just for this issue cause I know developers sometimes lurk around here and I'm sick of this mechanic. WHEN a unit is resiliant it should NOT keep the green buffs from the previous round cause it's just not fair .. when a new round starts, all accounts should be clean. That's why unit cards are moved to the graveyard, and you don't get points from them. But then, why should you get points off of their abilities or special cards? It makes no sense whatsoever. I've had plenty of games whereby opponent buffs his units to apsurd amounts, make them resiliant and win the round, so when the next round starts I have 2 cards (cause I was trying to win the first round so the resiliance would go away for the third, but I failed) and he also has 2 cards but also like 60 points from previous round. So what am I suppose to do exactly. And if he didn't have the buffs it'd be just around 12 points or something which is not apsurd and is easily beatable. Thank you for reading and understanding</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I knew I would get this kind of responses like "Oh you noob, you have to counter it" well first off mybe my deck is not removal heavy and I haven't drawn any of it, let alone have enough to deal with such units. But anyway that's not the point. The thing is, it's not consistent with the game. Like I said, new rounds should be fresh starts, and okay you have special cards that are designed to keep units, but then keep oly the unit, not every single card attached to it. And if they changed that maybe we would see more base stregth buffs introduced and have a more balanced deck playing with that idea. Right now, this is just crazy in my opinion. I know it doesn't happen often, but still, it should be monitored and dealt with</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You guys are just not getting my point ... so if you're okay with this, why aren't you freaking out that units get sent to the graveyard upon rounds end. Or maybe you should get all the special cards that you used back in your hand cause this mechanic is equalent to that. It's an unfair advantage. In what else way can I put this.. Okay listen here, I know CDPR are against bronze cards having like 20+ value, and guess what!? Adrenaline rush does exactly that! It's a bronze card that gives a player a huge unit at the start of a round</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahah, I guess I'll just be like any objective and insightful scientist ever, everyone will think I'm crazy until CDPR actually sees the problem with this and changes it. Until then I'll just be a "whiny brat". Well okay then, not much I can do. Oh and if they did see my point, they would have other arguments other than your deck sucks you need removal to play this game...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since this game is all about card advantage I feel this feature should not exist. Lets say you go first in the first round and to win you will in most cases have to be a card down and sometimes even two, which of course i an automatic loss in the long run.. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's still "oppressive" as they like to call it. I mean it's not unusal that the opponent has 3 of them at a time and you cant deal with them; it's still insane value, and it's it's a brainless play really, it's a powerful card in and of itself having it buffed to 7 and then it's still *endless* value until the end of the round. It's super powerful with no drawbacks. It should have been reworked to deal damage to both sides and let it be a part of self damaging archetype which is dead currently.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Flavor mechanic for agile units that make no sense</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-11 18:43:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example a knight on a horseback makes no sense being on the siege row, he makes no impact on the battlefield that way; gwent being a simulation of a battle of course. So I had an idea how to make it more flavourful per se, what if the horsmen have a 2 turn timer when they are played on a ranged or siege row and when the timer expires they would move one row up until they reach the melee row. So if you play it on ranged after two turns it would move to melee and if played on siege they would move to ranged and then reset the timer and again after that move to melee. That would simulate a horseman charging from the back rows to the front where he'd actually be useful. It would make for some interesting plays I think. Not sure how yet but still haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well HS and most card games have a curve in the sense of mana or some other resources. Therefore cards in gwent are all supposed to be balanced in the same power level which is difficult. Plus health and point power are the same thing so there to are they limited in design and so forth</TEXT>

I invented this combo (as far as I know, maybe not), but I play him with Emhyr and I play Alba Pikemen so first turn put down Pikeman dude then Regis, he procs Roach, next turn Emhyr out the roach, get golems and 0lay Thunderbolt and BAM you're 30 points ahead counting the Regis buff. Then pass and if the opponent tries to catch up, he'll already be down a card or two and for the final surprise the last Pikeman comes in and maybe takes the lead again At that point the opponent forfeits and that's the story of how powerful Regis combo is. Please no nerf or change in the upcoming patch :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been playing TES: Legends (you know just because it was on the app store) and I found an interesting mechanic in that game which is self buffing. Basically units that buff other units can target themselves (applies any other effect really) and I think that'd be really great in gwent as well. Maybe if you play a unit that locks and you can only lock your units, but you don't want to, that unit could lock itself so you dont lose value. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, but ask yourself why. Maybe because the average worth of a bronze card is now 14 points or more? Decks usually run 15 bronzes, most of those said units, silver and gold cards usually have big bodies as well, but not as big as bronzes now but still.. Now imagine a board full of 15+ units. Gee I wish I could halve that number.. therefore, the popularity of hailstorm. So maybe if they go back to the old bronze system, we would not see so many hailstorms. Who would want to halve a board full of 6-8 str units. Maybe a deck built around that idea. But then it would just be that deck and not every deck. So there we go. Card itself is okay on its on, what makes it so powerful is the (unbalanced) game itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay I just woke up and I have not given this any actual thought but hear me out. Maybe we should take a look at other ccgs to find the solution so here's what I got. The player that goes first gets an extra spawned card, it can be a 2 str statue for all I care, but, when you play that card you have to play one of your cards with it that turn, so you'd lose the one card advantage. BUT if you dont use it in the first round, it disappears from your hand for the second round. Give it some thought and comment what you think. Make up possible scenarios where it'd be good or broken and let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So yeah Im sure you've all found yourself in a situation where you lost round one and lets say you went into round two on even cards. Then the opponent just passes and youre forced to play a card to take the round and also be the first one playing in the third round. Which brings you to minus two card advantage. So what if there was a mechanic whereby a 1 str unit is spawned for the opposite player of who dry passes (passes with no cards played) and then youd go into round 3 with even cards, which seems more fair by far. But for the player that won round one, you still get the reward of opponent going first in round 3 and having that one card up</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha so if no one get any advantages by winning/losing coin flip, why do you think people try to come up with solutions for it. The synergies between those cards are a part of the advantage you would get with this fix. Like I said if you have a hand full of pro active play you cant do anything, this way you can combo out your first play and then be at -1 cards but with a bear starting out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are already so many synergies with just mulliganing a single card, and still he has to buff himself too? Im playing a bloody baron deck and I have to work throughout the whole game to make him viable, and Vrihedd Officers dont have to do a damn thing and are sometimes bigger than I ever pulled my baron. You cant even say oh but baron is gold so he's better, you know, since golds are not targetable. I have a really big issue with this card even if its two points lower.</TEXT>

Tell me whats so wrong to have him be regressing. Its a fair bronze then. 20+ str is not a fair bronze. Thats a Tibor. I mean it only makes sense..</TEXT>

But I do see your point. And also no thinning is really hard for me because I often make decks that do a lot of thinning, because you want to get the most value from your deck as possible, so yeah, mill is a really hard matchup for me as a player in general.

And not only will then there be more cards overall but all these 'simple' cards are great for beginners.

    <TITLE>Salty over the removal of mobile version</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-13 00:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ever since this game came out I was craving to play it on mobile because I dont really have the time to sit down in front of a PC and play a few rounds. Im more of a on the move type of person you could say. To be clear I LOVE the game, its just so beautiful and the gameplay system within itself is unique and amazing. So naturally I wanted to play it and week after week, month after month I was checking the play store for the Android version, only to be disapointed again and again. At some point I forgot about it, moved on, started playing Hearthstone again. And now after more than half a year I thought of it again, I tried my luck on the app store and BAM there it was. I was sooo happy.. only to find out that it wasn't compatible with my device. Yeah, later on I read that they were tracking the mobile version back and I'm just so salty I guess.. also I found out about the B2P model which they will be implementing and realisticly, come on, no way it's gonna compete on today's ccg market. All in all, oh well. I wish the game best of luck, and maybe just maybe if the mobile version ever happens again, do a bit more marketing for it ;)</TEXT>

Guess what happened? Reddit got mad at me, told me I suck etc and couple of months later CDPR changed it to reset to base str if unit got carried over. Its common sense Just like it is common sense that the opponent is NOT allowed to get free card advantage, which you can imagine is very very VERY important in gwent just because he had ridicoulous tempo in round one. Its common fucking sense and I cant believe people actually think this is okay. Fuck me silly if this subreddit aint right in its head...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Artifact Is Far From A Dead Game, But..</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-14 01:14:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Statistically, I belive that Artifact is far from a dead game. The Elder Scrolls Legends and Faeria have fewer numbers and both games are steady in development even though there is really no chance to bring a significant number of new players to those games. Gwent is also somehere around the same numbers as Artifact and rarely anyone calls it a dead game, especially with the new updates coming, same as Artifact. So what's with artifact that makes people literally scream everywhere and to everyone that it's a dead game. Well first of all, expectations. Many people thought that Artifact would be something different than it turned out to be so now many people are salty and mad that the game they hyped over for months is not what they imagined. Second of all, I think many people are simply chaotic, if they see something failing they like to bandwagon it and join the banter. But wait, so if Artifact is nowhere near a dead game, but many people are calling it as such, what does that mean? Unfortunately, it means that the game has become a meme. Literal living meme, and whoever mentions the game in any context is going to get bombarded by the 'gem is ded' meme, and I dont ever see it going away. Even with all the patches, it will always be a meme for most of the vocal idiots.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Artifacts Should Have Armor.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-23 00:42:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seems like this sub doesn't allow title only posts so I'll rant here a bit, although the title is all I have to say really. I think it's very logical to introduce armor to artifacts since we all know the binary aspect to card games is always bad. You have artifact removal - win; you don't - lose. It's golden immunity all over again, and I think the game would benefit a lot if artifacts had armor so you could decide if it's worth using your damage to destroy it or not. Just now I played a game against lock NG, opponent had 2 cards in hand. First one he pleaced, the blue artifact which gives zeal, and the last the guy that takes locked units. Meanwhile I have 14 pt engine on board and a bunch of damage in orders, but still I can't do anything to stop this combo from going off. Feel free to discuss in the comments.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-09 00:25:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen some unusual behaviour and been wondering if those are bots. Like the red mouseover outline would flash over one card constantly, then skip a couple of cards back and forth and they always rope and at the end play a pretty 'complex' play, but somehow still on time while I was sure they would run out of time and discard. I've noticed it mostly with averege and big boy monsters, which wouldn't surprise me if those are bots since it's a pretty brain-dead deck to pilot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just bought Thronebreaker for the first time, it was 50% off this week, and what I instantly noticed is the old gameplay system. What I mean by that is basically no drag and drop, and when placing a card it's the old blue line instead of the low opacity card preview. I haven't tested it yet, but I wonder if you have more than 10 cards, do you discard them like before, or are they turned into mulligans. I'm afraid to find out to be honest. So I just wonder how come they haven't updated it to the current standard?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any tips for improving game performance?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-28 21:15:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll start off by saying that I absolutely love this game, but, it runs like shit on my machine to say the least. I bought the game during the free weekend and even though I knew performance was bad, I still went ahead and bought it just because I couldn't stop thinking about the game during the day and how much I wanted to play it, I'm sure you know the feeling. To get to the point; I'm running on Intel i5-8250U processor 8 gigs of RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 2 gigs of VRAM I'm getting an averege of like 25 FPS. On some areas, mostly at the start when there aren't many effects, it can go up to around 35 FPS. And then again during some really action heavy moments it can go down to as low as 15 FPS which is obviously unacceptable. I did some configuration on the user config and engine files which I found online, but obviously it's not much of use. Lowering the resolution doesn't seem to help either so I kept it at the original ratio of 1920x1080. So now, any info, any tips or tricks would be very much appreciated, because I still can't stop thinking about this game and I would love to be able to play it properly... Somehow. Sorry for any typos, writing this on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I recently sort of discovered the importance of SSR, and honestly don't know why every app built with React isn't actually built using Next. But that's a digression. My question is simple; so when using getStaticProps, or getServerSideProps in Next, is it a good idea to then store that prop in state when it reaches the functional component? Because maybe I want to change that data through a user request, and I'm not sure how to go about that any other way, but storing prop in state seems wrong to me.. So any tips are appreciated. Also, it confuses the hell out of me when you should use getStaticProps and when getServerSideProps. They just seem the same to me? Like they serve the same purpose of filling your app with data before serving it to the client so crawlers can index it better (or at all).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I thank you for your answer, it does clear up some things. But I'm still in the gray when it comes to serverSideProps. I don't know if I'm just dull or what, but it seems like someone needs to literally draw it out for me unfortunately... The docs kinda repeat what you said (or the other way around), "getServerSideProps will be triggered on each request", but what does that mean practically? To me it sounds like if you fetch some other data, or that component updates or something, getServerSideProps would retrigger and return new props, which might be different than the last time, which then would populate whatever tags display that data in your component. But it doesn't seem to work that way (maybe obviously for you). So if you, or someone, could elaborate more on that I'd be really grateful. Like I said, docs sort of stop at that sentence which I quoted and it's still vague to me. EDIT: on the second read, I feel like I understand now. So literally when you build the NextJS app, static props are added, and serverSideProps are triggered every time a user goes to your page. If that's so, what would you actually put in getStaticProps? I imagine you'd put your axios/fetch calls in getServerSideProps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if this is console specific, but I'm playing on switch and the input lag is out of this world. I would go to training mode, learn some combos, ususally beat the arcade mode with the new character I'm learning and then go online. And boy oh boy is it different. I can't even string the bread and butter combo that I just did a million times in other single plyer modes. Due to the input lag, I always drop my combos, and while in SP I could have easily dodged after opponent blocks all my basic attacks, in online it is impossible.

    <TEXT>After googling for a long long time, no one seems to have the same issue as me. The gist is, I have a scrolling animation. There are stacked cards, you can swipe the top one left and right using panGestureHandler. And that is working fine at 60fps. Now, when you pass the swipe threshold, I call a function that updates the active index, in other words, which card is at the top, and I animate other cards accordingly, but, when I update the state, everything freezes for a couple of seconds, it is very very noticable. I am using useNativeDriver on every animation and still the JS thread is blocking on state updates. Is this just a case of I should use reanimated, or is there some underlying issue?</TEXT>
