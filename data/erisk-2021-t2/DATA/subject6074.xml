    <TITLE>Does anyone else regret selling/trading in an older Jeep for a newer one?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-20 13:18:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know the Liberty wasn't a popular Jeep, but I still see a lot of the 1st Gen models still on the road with 150k+ miles on them and the drivers tell me they still run great. I replaced mine with the 2014 Jeep Cherokee (Latitude/4X4/AD1) and while its a decent car, I feel like I could've saved the 22k i dropped on it and kept my Liberty running good.  #8203; Anyone else in a similar situation? https://preview.redd.it/qq3me6kpkgb31.jpg?width=2808 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=d75660c3a128402a4fc694fdd0c17786a1940d9e</TEXT>

From Twitter to Reddit, I haven #8217;t seen a single person state they want Dreyfus back on the podcast. This might be a sign of my own limitations or lack of wit but I haven #8217;t heard Dreyfus say a single insightful thing in any of his appearances. Am I alone in this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: Floyd Mayweather #8217;s in ring accomplishments still place him as the Pound for Pound better boxer.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-26 20:04:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>This past weekend Manny Pacquiao, at 40 years of age won the welterweight title, making him the oldest fighter to ever win a welterweight title. Manny Pacquiao has held titles in eight different divisions and at 40 years old is still going strong. Floyd Mayweather has been retired for some years now, and he #8217;s a bit older than Manny Pacquiao. But during Floyd Mayweather #8216;s tenure as an elite boxer he was undefeated, Not only was Floyd Mayweather undefeated but he was consistently dominant throughout his career having few actual close fights or instances where he was hurt by his opponents. Floyd Mayweather also holds the distinction of being an Olympic medalist in a competition where it #8217;s widely regarded that corrupt judging and refereeing gave Floyd #8217;s opponent the victory even though Floyd should have won that victory himself. Floyd Mayweather #8216;s record stands at 50 wins and no losses. He matched legendary fighter Rocky Marciano #8216;s boxing record. Not only that but during that time that him and Manny Pacquiao were considered top-tier fighters, they were also considered rivals. After some years the two eventually fought on the 2nd of May 2015. Floyd Mayweather won a competitive but decisive decision over Manny Pacquiao. With the exception of Miguel Cotto and Juan Manuel Marquez, Floyd Mayweather fight every mutual opponent they had before Manny Pacquiao did, and he generally for them when they were coming off long win streaks. I have heard people claim that despite Pacquiao #8217;s loss to Mayweather, his ring resume is more impressive and much like Roberto Derann and sugar Ray Leonard, Pacquiao is the greater all-time fighter. I #8217;m not convinced by this but I #8217;m open to having my mind changed. I maintain for now the Floyd Mayweather is not just a superior fighter between the two of them but in terms of his overall career accomplishments is also the superior fighter I have heard people claim that despite Pacquiao #8217;s loss to Mayweather, his ring resume is more impressive and much like Roberto Derann and sugar Ray Leonard, Pacquiao is the greater all-time fighter. I #8217;m not convinced by this but I #8217;m open to having my mind changed. I maintain for now the Floyd Mayweather is not just a superior fighter between the two of them, but in terms of his overall career accomplishments is also the superior fighter. Let me know what you guys think.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Matt Welch claims minimum wage was one of the laws set up to  #8220;exclude or punish black people #8221;. Is anyone aware of evidence for this being one of the explicit intents of the law as opposed to a happy byproduct for racists at the time?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Here #8217;s his quote from the recent podcast. Time stamp @ 1:07:00  gt;What are the structures, where are they? What are the laws that were written to deliberately, at the time that were deliberately set up to exclude or punish black people... some of them are less obvious to the eye such as we #8217;re going to increase minimum wage, so that immigrants and black people cant take these jobs. (This quote is heavily cleaned up of  #8220;ums #8221; and Kmele #8217;s interjections) I haven #8217;t seen much outside of various conservative/libertarian pundits with strong inclinations against minimum wage laws, so maybe conveniently for me, I #8217;m skeptical. Any and all help will be appreciated. Thanks</TEXT>

One of those two may or may not be a more important asset of the company. That has almost nothing to do with EO companies tmk.

    <TEXT> gt;It isn't about how hard you work, it's about how valuable your work is. that's why doctors get paid more than nurses, architects get paid more than builders I'm not arguing for parity in pay, I'm saying that the "value" of work is not determined on a meritocratic basis, but based on proximity to power.  gt; And yes, factory owners and company owners get paid more than the people working on them. There are very few people who run a factory but there are millions of workers. This is just you reiterating the status quo as if appealing to the status quo is self justifying. You did this in the other response too.  gt; The owner spends millions to have the factory built and continues to spend millions on providing resources. You walk into an interview room and answer a few questions. That is why they get the profit. Those "millions" aren't made by the owner though. That capital is first loaned from a bank who itself gets it from the reserve, the business, if successful, then proceeds to extract value from the labor class and the consumer base. Yes, this includes doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers etc. All of whom demonstrably do more than "walk into a room and answer a few questions" (Jesus what a naive and ignorant thing to say). If you're going to just appeal to the status quo again as self justification, I don't know how much more can be discussed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Well why don't you explain to me why the owner of the company takes most of the profit? I think it's proximity to power and control. The owners, company shareholders etc. extract value from capital transactions. Neither is actually designing, testing, building, moving and selling the product. The product is quite literally produced by the various laborers involved and the capital is generated by the consumers. The owners divvy funds out to cover costs and either reinvest the profits into the company (avoiding taxes in the process) or take the profit for themselves.  gt;And is there a solution to this that doesn't involve forcing the owner to give you the money using the government. Typically strong unions are good at minimizing the disparity in pay between owners and laborers. There's still a hierarchy where pay is disproportionately given to the owners/managers but laborers at least have representation in disputes. Worker Coops are ideal though.  gt;I'm trying to figure out how this system works and maybe we can provide the equal opportunity to make money that capitalism should be about. Production makes use of embodied labor (Equipment/raw material used) and living labor (the people involved). The two together become the value added (the total labor costs) and determine the cost of production. After the product is sold, total labor is recouped plus profit. Here's where we split. I think that profit should be paid back, by and large to the laborers in bonuses/dividends (remember their salary is already accounted for in living labor costs). In the current model, C-Suite allocates funds to pay the salary and keeps the rest. This greed and inequity is especially embodied to the exorbitant exit packages CEO's get when they leave companies. Where does that money come from, simple, profits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Of course, the status quo works. The status quo works for who though and how we,, does it work for them? Feudalism was the status quo, for centuries, so was colonialism, religious superstition, slavery, indentured servitude, child labor, seven day work weeks, no education past the fifth grade etc. Society advanced under these systems too. I think it #8217;s fair to say at every junction there was somebody, in your position, cynical of progress, claiming the  #8220;status quo works #8221;. (I #8217;m not drawing a moral equivalence between you and them though)  gt;Why would you want to change it unless your adding more of what made it work. Funny enough, societies have become more egalitarian and progressive with time. We abolished slavery and Jim Crowe, we created the 40 hour work week, banned child labor, taxed the rich, made high school free, strengthened the wall between church and state etc. It shouldn #8217;t come as a shock that the nations that score highest on human freedom are largely mixed economic/social democratic states. Non are purely capitalistic, the highest have strong welfare state policies and regulatory apparatuses. Here #8217;s [Cato #8217;s list](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/cato-human-freedom-index-update-3.pdf) Paradoxically maybe, the stronger the gov #8217;t intervention into the market to insure fairness, the more free the people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a bit more complicated than that. Figure 1 and 2 in the CATO study differentiate between legal/illegal status but there are many more distinctions to be made. Country and origin, education level, religion, age etc. These pro/anti immigration arguments are completely dumbed down and stripped of nuance. Illegal immigration is determined by apprehension, but tmk there aren #8217;t many ways to properly account for just how many undocumented migrants we have here. And let #8217;s not white wash this either. Crime among native born Americans may or may not be higher, but it #8217;s most likely significantly lower among the demographic that is opposed to immigration. Our violent crime rate is disproportionately driven up by inner city gang violence, not the rural yokels and suburbanites who vote MAGA. So Illegal immigrants most likely do  #8220;bring #8221; more crime than these people are probably used to. Anyways here #8217;s an article from a while back, getting at some of the taboos in the issue.

    <TEXT>Imo this is a reductionist take on immigration. Immigration's effects are dependent on many variables like the income and education level, what industries they move into, whether they can "chain migrate", how fast or slow they assimilate culturally, what are the cultural norms surrounding immigration, do they spread out or do they remain in ethnic enclaves etc.  #8203; Immigration in, let's say the labor trades hasn't been all that helpful to us who work in construction. But I'm sure for the avocado toast eating millennial (don't worry, I hate that stereotype too), have low wage, low skill migrants to pick their fruits and veggies for cheap is beneficial.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the very study you #8217;re posting  gt; There have been many studies of the economic consequences of immigration, and they do not all agree. Findings are sometimes specific to the experiment at hand, as in the Mariel boatlift case, where it could be argued that the Miami labor market is not representative of the U.S. as a whole. This study doesn #8217;t differentiate between types of migrant labor either. From what I can see it simply draws on anyone not born in the US. I don #8217;t know anyone who is going to claim someone who came here when they were a toddler is going to compete in a labor market the same way someone who came here eight months ago is. This is a quote by George Borjas  gt; anyone who tells you that immigration doesn #8217;t have any negative effects doesn #8217;t understand how it really works. When the supply of workers goes up, the price that firms have to pay to hire workers goes down. Wage trends over the past half-century suggest that a 10 percent increase in the number of workers with a particular set of skills probably lowers the wage of that group by at least 3 percent. Even after the economy has fully adjusted, those skill groups that received the most immigrants will still offer lower pay relative to those that received fewer immigrants. Immigration redistributes wealth from those who compete with immigrants to those who use immigrants #8212;from the employee to the employer. I #8217;ll post George Borjas #8217; work when I get some free time today.</TEXT>

That we #8217;re *one of* the greatest nations in the world is a demonstrable fact imo.  gt; And you do see it on this sub, notice how every upvoted comment in this thread is talking about how great the US actually is, and actual criticism is not upvoted or even downvoted. I actually don #8217;t notice that. Imo there #8217;s also nothing unique about people (especially in nation/politics and culture related subs) upvoting praise and ignoring criticism.

Libertarians can joke about  #8220;it wasn #8217;t real communism #8221; but ffs at least the commies got their movement off the ground. Libertarianism is a meme ideology that survives because of its close proximity to the donor class.

    <TEXT>Dems don #8217;t dislike Libertarians like that in my opinion. Historically it was the libertarians who decided to prioritize market fundamentalism and essentially create a political coalition with conservatives i.e. Fusionism. Even though overall Libertarians had more in common with lefties on issues like foreign policy, drugs, same sex marriage, criminal justice etc. I could go into the more cynical take on fusionism and tie it into the libertarian party #8217;s racist past but I don #8217;t know if that #8217;s a fair response.</TEXT>

Joking aside I feel like D amp;T have a bit of culture warrior shtick on the low (Peez especially). I #8217;m probably wrong, but it seems like they have a hard time keeping their emotions in check when these topics come up.</TEXT>

This isn #8217;t the 1960 #8217;s, the wealthy don #8217;t universally flee NY once they #8217;ve made it, now they congregate and own/rent in remedy downtown areas within close proximity to the many opportunities that come with it. Not to mention how silly the whole notion of  #8220;returning #8221; the roads to pedestrians as if the ability of people to travel into cities from far out didn #8217;t contribute immensely to growth of NY.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I #8217;ve read and seen here, that #8217;s not entirely the case here. I know it seems counterintuitive. I #8217;ll grab you some of the (admittedly limited) data on this either during my lunch break or after work. The cliff notes version is that median household income of car owners varies by borough. Staten Island has the highest median household income for car owners while Queens and the Bronx am have the lowest. In NYC car ownership actually tracks more closely with access to mass transit, because we tend to disproportionately work in and around the city. In the past 10-15 years as NY has gentrified the neighborhoods closer and closer to the city have become extremely expensive and highly sought after by a new class of, I guess you could say yuppies. They have the close proximity that makes cycling a viable alternative and the kind of jobs that allow for that. I work in construction, we start around 5am to 6am and if I lived in neighborhoods far into the outer boroughs I don #8217;t think I #8217;d be able to put an hour and a half into cycling to work at 3:30am everyday as opposed to the less than 20 minute drive I #8217;m afforded now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a fair response, thanks and sorry for getting a bit snappy about it. I don #8217;t know a whole lot about urban planning but I #8217;ll see if I can lay out my thought process. So much access to opportunity and good jobs exists in the city that people are incentivized to work here, yet as the city has gotten more and more expensive, working class people have been forced to mover further and further away to maintain affordability. Car ownership increases as you move further out and many of us rely on our cars to get to work in the city (I work in LIC). I know cycling is great for the environment and our health and I do a bit of cycling myself, but tailoring the city for cyclists and pedestrians will have adverse effects on those of us who have to drive in to work. The people who are well off enough to afford to live in Manhattan, Williamsburg, Astoria, DUMBO etc. won #8217;t need cars for transport and can profit from the new and improved city. I think we need a serious expansion and modernization of the MTA here (especially for the outer boroughs) That would incentivize drovers to use mass transit instead of making traveling so hard they give up. Once less people actually need to drive in, then maybe we can follow up with cyclist and pedestrian friendly improvements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to come off like a snob, but this really isn #8217;t how the American political system works imo, especially when it comes to guns. Constitutional amendments require an _immense_ amount of political cohesion and unity. A two thirds majority would be required in both the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Ratification by states (iirc also a two thirds majority) has never happened. The correlation between gun crime and legal gun ownership is also inversed. A disproportionate majority of gun violence (NOT suicide) takes place due to urban gang crime where few of the perpetrators are actually legal owners. There #8217;s a whole bag of bs around our federalist system and there #8217;s a lot less direct top down control/centralization of power like there is in nations where people like to boast about prior responses to mass shootings (i.e. Canada, Australia, NZ etc.) And then there #8217;s the whole issue with the gun lobby which adds an extra layer of difficulty in getting guns off the streets.</TEXT>

I can #8217;t run a historical hypothetical of what ifs. I can simply look at the results with the benefit of  #8220;hindsight #8221; and make a value judgement. If you can explain why declaring himself president for life, jailing political dissidents and homosexuals and crushing civil liberties up until his death was justified then I #8217;m all ears.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His analysis is completely devoid of any assessment of the material conditions and the abstinence only policy is a good analogy in my opinion. Just like his comments, Texas politicians had the same idea that teen pregnancy was simply an issue of lifestyle choice and that if people were just taught to be  #8220;more responsible #8220; that it could reduce teen pregnancy which is a big determining of lifelong poverty. So instead of taking some of the resources of the state and allowing for better sex education and access to contraceptives for these mostly lower/working class kids, politicians went the  #8220;personal responsibility #8221; route and eventually watched teen pregnancy skyrocket.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the context of this particular thread the focus is policy, but I can concede your point on the analogy not doing much to dispute the principle directly. (Personally, I do actually believe that on an individual level people should try to live by a more conservative ethos, I just think societies fail when they implement that ethos at the state level). Imo the  #8220;principle #8221; here is informing their politics though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It definitely doesn #8217;t. RJJ by then had suffered quite a few devastating losses. He was older, had more fights under his belt against stronger competition and what seems like severe brain trauma by then. I know people make a lot of noise about his win over Jeff Lacy but calling this guy a legend... I don #8217;t know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Promoters hyping up Lacy doesn #8217;t actually mean Calzaghe deserved anywhere near the level of hype his fans heaped on him in turn. I #8217;m also somewhat skeptical of that particular narrative, obviously I wasn #8217;t old enough at the time but looking back I don #8217;t see a whole lot about Jeff Lacy being some kind of world beater outside of whatever BS his promotion may have tried to put forward. I think if you assess Lacy on the merits he was a decent fighter. I #8217;m not saying Calzaghe was bad I guess I #8217;m just saying he #8217;s overrated and to call him a legend is a stretch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve asked two people to put forward some actual evidence and I #8217;ve gotten nothing except this general perception. A poll on here would mean nothing considering how far this sub skews to the right and towards Gen Z who have little work experience. I work in construction (excavation) here in NY and the labor force here if they even talk about politics usually just do it to take a shit on Trump and our bosses who are by and large Trump fanboys. Honestly though I do think it would be interesting to find this stuff out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>3 instances out of 300,000,000+ people. I #8217;m sure there #8217;s more out there but I think it #8217;s a bit naive to use small anecdotes like this and then also somehow believe that this hasn #8217;t happened in the UK. Yeah sure the spread of this kind of identity politics into British political discourse may be a form of American cultural imperialism, but acting like somehow the UK is above this kind of IDPol stupidity is the height of (dare I say) pompous imperial British arrogance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not saying you agree with it and the idea that Americans getting gift decisions is never brought up is something that can be disproven on this very sub. This is mostly what I #8217;m getting at, you seem to be assuming that he doesn #8217;t think Americans are ever gifted decisions. From what I can see, that is not something he #8217;s implied in his comment. That #8217;s just my opinion. I don #8217;t know if this is something we should waste our time debating though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s some truth to their statement though. Debaathification, disenfranchising the Sunni (thanks Brenner) and throwing security into the hands of untrained and ill equipped IA/IP created the power vacuum that opened up space for a sectarian civil war. Anecdotally I was there right at the beginning of the surge and the difference between pre surge and post surge was night and day. We needed to commit to the conflict 110%. And before the inevitable comment, yes obviously we shouldn #8217;t have been there in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I've admired Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' focus on trying to level the economic playing field but have never considered voting for him -- I thought him to be too radical. I've long gotten New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's blue collar appeal but have vehemently disagreed with her on policies, believing some of them would be taking us too far to the left. I'm among the small minority of Black voters who chose former President George W. Bush in 2000 and have voted for well-known Republicans such as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. (Excerpt from the article) I would say  #8220;This but unironically #8221; but it #8217;s not like Bailey will actually become a  #8220;socialist #8221; because traditional rightoids like him have their new place in the modern Democratic Party thanks to Biden. Maybe this is a bit of a shit post but I found it the brief moment of self awareness funny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imo it would help if more people on the left made an actual effort to reach across to centrist/lib types like Harris and convince him of this. If Sam #8217;s general impression of the modern left is informed by too often, snarky fucks like Michael Brooks (RIP) and Glenn Greenwald (love the Intercept but GG has acknowledged he can be very aggressive online), I don #8217;t think he #8217;s going to be able to acknowledge just how disingenuous Shapiro is because Shapiro is generally courteous to Sam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: Sorry for the essay, I might try and make this response more concise in a bit. I didn #8217;t say those were the only two leftists? I #8217;m using them as an example of the kind of cynical and mean spirited leftist pundit that has probably been informing Sam #8217;s view of the left. Not to mention his interaction with Chomsky who was far from civil with him in that exchange. Yeah, it would be great if SH could get more genuine leftists on the podcast, he had Taibbi on but also others like Lee Fang, Brianna Grey Joy, Richard Wolff, Matt Stoller, Freddie DeBoer, Barbara #8217;s Fields, Cornell West etc. Also, Brooks and Greenwald don #8217;t have anymore ability to be objective and critical of  #8220;their own side #8221; than Shapiro does. Being critical of woke neoliberals isn #8217;t indicative of them being critical of their own side because there #8217;s little relation between genuine leftists and woke neoliberals. In the same way Shapiro being critical of the alt right isn #8217;t somehow him being critical of his own side in my opinion. Until I see Greenwald acknowledging he was wrong about some fundamental belief he held or critique of someone he made, I #8217;m skeptical that he #8217;s anything more than an ideologue, one who just happens to line up with like 90% of what I believe. I don #8217;t think Brooks ever showed the capacity to think he was wrong about core beliefs of his too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I sort of agree, while yes for any self-styled public intellectual the onus is somewhat on them to broaden their intellectual horizons, Sam is a part of the status quo, so I think in much the same way the onus is on us leftists to put ourselves out there in a way that will make our policy platform and ideals accessible. Not that it matters, and I don #8217;t want to sound like I #8217;m dancing on his grave but Michael Brooks spent some time talking about how the left needed to be more compassionate. He said this all while building his public persona on his ability to mock and deride other people. Remember Sedar essentially brought them on because of his ability to impersonate and make fun of other people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, only in heavyweight is the gross disparity in size between competitors the norm. Tyson Fury has enjoyed a significant reach, height, weight and strength advantage in almost every fight he #8217;s had. We don #8217;t expect guys in most of the lower weight classes to put up with this and those weight classes have been endlessly partitioned over the years. Only downside I can see to this is the general lack of talent though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats my thinking. I don #8217;t think Suleiman cares but in my opinion heavyweight has always been an unfair division. We don #8217;t expect fighters at the lower weights to tolerate the kind of size/strength discrepancies seen between guys like Tyson fury and his opponents, anywhere near as much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True but heavyweight I think is the one area that should get split. Size disparities are too large.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Finland is one of the most stable, secure and homogenous societies in the world. I don #8217;t know if you can use that as a proper measuring stick. Anyways it #8217;s not like Sweden, France or Germany haven #8217;t seen some significant polarization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably lying about sources of income. I don #8217;t want to play into nasty stereotypes unnecessarily so I #8217;ll just leave it at this (very anecdotal account), I #8217;ve been the almost victim of an insurance fraud scheme and given a counterfeit check and both times they were two very wealthy Hasidic business owners. Some of my family bought a home in Williamsburg back in the 70 #8217;s when they moved up from PR and they #8217;ve had some genuinely shocking stories to tell about the community there. Here #8217;s an [LA Times piece ](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-new-jersey-orthodox-20170923-story.html) from a few years back</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not unaware of Finland #8217;s strenuous relationship with Russia, I find most of the Russia hysteria to border on conspiracy theory territory and I #8217;m not gonna act like Russia hasn #8217;t become a boogeyman in a lot of the center-left media. I just personally kind of roll my eyes anytime some Lilly white Scandinavian utopia is brought up as some  #8220;well actually why can #8217;t the Americans just be more like the Scandinavians? #8221;. I #8217;m not saying the US can #8217;t be more like them, I just find them to be an incredibly flawed template for how America can rid itself of a lot of its economic/political/cultural woes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I just don't buy the idea that because US is big, that the problems are impossible to fix. IF they are, then more power should be given to the states - one big problem in US is the amount of power President has. I can concede most of what you say, this is the only point I #8217;d nitpick honestly. The federalist system of governance in the US gives way too much power to the states and not enough to a centralized state. I know I #8217;m being somewhat simplistic but take a look at the various living standards between the 50 states here and then also take a look at which states are red and which states are blue. Between the Senate, the electoral college and the amount of executive power governors are given to implement their own individual policy I think we can see that some states are clearly exacerbating our problems. I know it sounds incredibly stereotypical and snobbish of me (I #8217;m from NY born and raised) but this country is such an insanely reactionary undemocratic capitalist nightmare and I blame the emergence of [fusionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusionism) and the neoliberal/corporate takeover of the American left. I don #8217;t think we #8217;re going to be able to follow the Scandinavian model out of this mess. But I #8217;m kind of talking outta my ass right now.</TEXT>
