    <TITLE>Can we tax lobbying?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-15 21:07:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ll admit I don #8217;t know much about lobbying or economics in general, but lobbying, as I understand it, is the act trying to curry favor and influence with politicians usually by setting up meetings, but also by making a pledge to contribute to their next election campaign. Regulations require disclosure on money spent on lobbying, but loopholes exist that make it difficult to tell specifics, Assuming I #8217;m correct on that, would it be possible to place a tax on money spent on lobbying, and if so, assuming such a bill actually made it through Congress, what kinds of economic effects could we expect to see?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know how many times I #8217;ve seen this, as soon the event starts, everyone else runs off in a different direction. Someone who #8217;s alone, becomes the bait, and gets overwhelmed. And then like dominos, everyone gets rushed before the others can reach them. Crew wipe within 1-3 minutes. The obvious strategy for this event is for everyone to stay near the basket, and let the swarm come to you. That way you #8217;re not trying to grab eggs from every corner of the map. When I had teams that did this, we were able to farm 20+ eggs from the event.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-04 19:43:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>My usual strategy going into a new Pok #233;mon game is to decide on a team, mostly made of new Pok #233;mon, going in and work towards getting and then using that team as I play. And while I have been enjoying that, every once and a while I #8217;ll hear someone talk about a Pok #233;mon they liked a lot that I never even tried to use. So this time around, instead of a fixed team, I want to try using an ever changing team. I was thinking I could do a modified Nuzlocke to force myself to diversify, but since the wild area is replacing routes those rules kinda don #8217;t work. So, I #8217;d like to ask this community for help with coming up with some self rules that #8217;ll make me catch Pok #233;mon I otherwise might not, and periodically force Pok #233;mon out of my team, so I will use a variety.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In High School, while doing a short video project for a class, I accidentally told the video production software to work off of the 1 gig school partition instead of my flash drive. There wasn #8217;t enough space to render the video, and it corrupted the file it was working off of. I had a backup from the previous day, and only had to redo about 20 minutes work, so I had the file ready to render again by the end of the class period. The teacher told me if I returned to render the video and turn it in by the end of the day, I #8217;d get 90%. Mildly annoying, but acceptable. It was already past lunch, and, I, being a Sophomore, didn #8217;t have a free period, so I attended my other classes and went back to the computer lab after school. It took less than ten minutes to render and submit the project, but that bitch told me that when she said end of the day, she meant end of the school day. So, instead of losing 10%, I was loosing 30%. TL;DR I once made a simple computer mistake that corrupted my project file, and my teacher took 30% off my project for turning it in the same day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few things. First, their list appears to be assembled chronologically. This isn #8217;t necessarily a bad thing, but some of the in the past supplemental chapters might confuse someone new to Honkai. I intentionally ordered my list to start with the original three girls, and introduce other characters and the side stories as they became relevant. Second, mangadex appears to have some additional chapters that are either not officially translated, or haven #8217;t been released in Global yet. Some of those, just may have been brought over yet. They seem to be preferring a periodic release rather than dumping all the chapters at once. Others, we may not have seen, because the creative team has decided to retcon them. Retconning is just an unfortunate reality with an ongoing story that is released periodically. For example, I know that most of the story from GGZ is considered a separate canon from HI3rd, and therefore any manga chapters that pertain to GGZ, might not apply to HI3rd as well. Finally, I prefer to, if possible, consume media through official channels rather than through piracy. And yes, uploading translated versions of a manga is a form of digital piracy.</TEXT>

Eve, in contrast, was made using one of Adam #8217;s ribs, and so she did submit herself to Adam. Adam and Eve went on to give rise to humanity, while Lilith escaped and became the mother of all demons that aren #8217;t fallen angels.</TEXT>

Feel free to experiment with different trees and see what you prefer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up playing the GBC ports. There were a bunch of name changes. Many because of limited space, but others might have just been because of the different translation team. Gwaelin - gt; Lora Erdrick - gt; Loto Dragonlord - gt; Dracolord Cantlin - gt; Mercado. Bubble Slime - gt; Babble. Gold Golem - gt; Goldman. Metal Slime - gt; Metaly Liquid Metal Slime - gt; Metababble That #8217;s all I remember off the top of my head. It #8217;s worth noting that the Japanese name for Erdrick is Roto, so Loto might have been a closer translation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s been a day, so I #8217;m a little late on this, but the manga is supplemental to the game. Mangadex lists the different arcs in chronological order so it might be a confusing for a new reader. But then the [official site](https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/book) has most of them just listed in no particular order, so that #8217;s also bad. I put together a [suggested reading order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiImpact3rd/comments/f53cpw/suggested_manga_reading_order/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf) for new readers on the official site, if you #8217;d prefer that. Of course, Mihoyo hasn #8217;t done official translations for everything that #8217;s on mangadex, so there #8217;s that to consider as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s that kind of thinking that makes the average apolitical person think that liberals are elitist. If you label everyone who #8217;s not as liberal as you a Republican, than they #8217;ll be more likely to vote republican if only because their voting against you. People are allowed to form their own opinions, even if it #8217;s ones that you disagree with. If you treat them with resentment for doing so, then they #8217;ll respond in kind. I #8217;m reminded of a quote from a book I always read this time of year.  gt;People on the side of The People always ended up disappointed, in any case. They found that The People tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward-thinking or obedient. The People tended to be small-minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness. And so the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.  gt;As soon as you saw people as things to be measured, they didn't measure up.  gt; -Night Watch by Sir Terry Pratchett (GNU)</TEXT>

The riot was what happens when you have panicking people trapped between idiots on horseback and other idiots shouting  #8220;yeah, right! #8221; and trying to push forward, and the whole thing in the charge of a fool advised by a maniac with a steel rule.  gt; The man wasn #8217;t a bad man, he knew; he must have been badly affected by the news to give such a stupid, dangerous order.  #8220;Do whatever you feel necessary. #8221; Give an order like that to a man who #8217;s liable to panic when he sees a bunch of people waving their fists and you got the Dolly Sisters Massacre.</TEXT>

We probably won #8217;t change each other #8217;s mind on this, but it usually doesn #8217;t hurt to get another perspective on things. The problem that the  #8220;Black Lives Matter #8221; movement has with the phrase  #8220;All Lives Matter #8221; is that it was adopted by people who do not support their movement to distract from the BLM #8217;s core argument. That argument being that black people are disproportionately being affected by police brutality. This is a symptom of other issues including the current police culture of the US (which is much more militaristic than that of other countries) and that there are lingering effects from segregation and the Jim Crow laws that should be addressed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[The Candiru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candiru) It #8217;s probably just an urban legend.  gt;According to Samad, the patient claimed "the fish had darted out of the water, up the urine stream, and into his urethra." While this is the most popularly known legendary trait of the candiru, according to Spotte it has been known conclusively to be a myth for more than a century, as it is impossible because of simple fluid physics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who only knows English, I find it fascinating when my coworkers who grew up speaking both English and Spanish start code mixing. They seemingly effortlessly switch languages, sometimes several times in the same sentence. I know from a linguist point of view it #8217;s considered to be an erosion of the languages in question, but from a practical point of view, provided all languages used are shared, it #8217;s like having extra synonyms to choose the meaning you intend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wonder if there is another option. Would it be possible to make tereports less  #8220;messy #8221; so that the Pa #8217;anuri don #8217;t get hurt by their use? Fair warning: I #8217;m about to go theoretical here. I remember the narrator describing hyperspace as a  #8220;tangled mess #8221; recently. As I understand it, hyperspace exists a separate  #8220;universe #8221; (for lack of a better word) but passes both the umbral and baryonic universes. Tereports hurt the Pa #8217;anuri by effectively punching a hole through the umbral universe as it passes through hyperspace. If I #8217;m understanding that correctly, it should then, be potentially possible to chart tereports through a different path in hyperspace that avoids the umbral universe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What happened on the night Castle Heterodyne was attacked? I #8217;m thinking that Lucrezia happened. In the prologue of the most recent novelization, we see Lucrezia, having just transferred Otillia into Von Pin, about to attempt to transfer the consciousness of The Castle into the clank body of Otillia. That scene ends with Lucrezia activating the transference device, and an implication that something went awry.  gt; Lucrezia laughed scornfully.  #8220;And that is the last time you will tell me what I should or should not do! #8221; She grasped the final switch.  #8220;Things are going to be different around here! #8221; With a shout of triumph, she threw the switch #8212; And things were very different indeed. The next bit of information also comes from that same book. In the description of [this scene](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20101112) the text adds that the map in the library was looping a depiction of the castle on the night of the attack. That loops shows multiple explosions originating within the castle. So what I think happened is that Lucrezia #8217;s attempt to pull the castles consciousness out is what caused those explosions. What I #8217;m not sure of, is what happened to her in between that attempt and her [arriving in the Geisterdamen #8217;s city.](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20051230) Given that the castle is capable of [functioning outside of time,](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20140526) it #8217;s possible that something happened to her at that moment. Lucrezia even implied when [talking to Klaus,](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20150424) that she was trapped somewhere for a time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Um. Wow. To quote a proctologist,  #8220;There is a lot unpack here. #8221; The history taught in American schools don #8217;t really cover much of the world outside of the US and Europe (except the parts where we #8217;re invading them). And even then not much of European history at that. I mentioned the European royalty because it #8217;s the example I heard while growing up. Specifically, when I was writing that comment, I was thinking of [Alexei Nikolaevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Nikolaevich,_Tsarevich_of_Russia) who famously had the genetic condition of Haemophilia (I genuinely do not know if he was descended from the Habsburgs or not). Royalty was also mentioned in an above comment, and used again by me because many royal lines (most famously the ancient Egyptian dynasties) preferred to keep things within the family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven #8217;t done the final trials yet, but it took me fewer attempts to clear the middle trials than the beginner trials. I put it down to the lessons learned during the first set. Lessons like: Chop down all the trees with bombs and then cook most of the wood for a quarter heart for each piece. Sneak up on the fairies in the rest stops. Save just before you start the attempt so you can enter each one with bonus hearts, yellow stamina wheels, and a 30 min (dragon horn) boost of your choice. Edit: You can also use stasis in combo with a bomb to break wooden crates without having to a) waste weapon durability, b) scatter the contents everywhere, or c) burn the crate (thereby cooking the valuable ingredients).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few more things I can think of. (Note: I #8217;m playing in standard mode) The Korock leaf is super useful for knocking enemies off of platforms. I used that to drown enemies, make them take fall damage, or even just give me enough time to 1v1 an enemy while the others run back up the platform. Don #8217;t fight mobs if you can avoid it. Try to lure just one of them away so you can focus on taking it down without getting hit. The thunderstorm rod you get from that wizrobe is also useful for stunning enemies, or making them drop their weapons. On the last floor,  gt;!there #8217;s a hinox with metal leg armor. You have to stun it (hit it #8217;s eye) to attack it normally, but like all hinoxes it #8217;ll start covering it #8217;s eye when it sees you start aiming. Stasis+ helps with that or bullet time if you can get airborne. I didn #8217;t try the thunderstorm rod, but it might also work here. The island it #8217;s on is pretty small so I had some trouble kiting it. Out of desperation, I started throwing my weapons at it. That did enough damage to win the battle. ! lt; lt;/TEXT gt;

In fact, the first impeachment [(Andrew Johnson)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) was done by passing a law (that was shortly thereafter ruled unconstitutional) by supermajority, and then impeaching the President as soon as he violated it. The congress at the time literally impeached him because they could.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Alternatively, you could say that the Democrats knew in advance that **any** impeachment wouldn #8217;t result in a conviction, so they tried to avoid doing so. However, even the accusation of withholding funds to an ally nation in exchange for political favor was serious enough that not investigating it would set a dangerous precedent. Effectively, their hands were tied. They **had** to open the impeachment investigation. Now whether it was handled properly is a different question. One the one hand, a proper investigation and trial would take years to complete, and he would be up for re-election during that time. If he loses, the investigation is somewhat moot, but if he wins and the investigation determines that there was an impeachable offense then should he even have been re-elected? The Democrats chose to rush the process to finish this up before the election. Add to that, the refusal by the executive branch to cooperate with the investigation, and things get even more muddied (Yes, they could have gotten the courts to rule on the congressional subpoena thing, and precedent would #8217;ve been on their side, but the judicial branch grinds slow, and they were in a hurry).</TEXT>

This is all entirely off the top of my head, so if I #8217;m wrong on anything, sorry, I was too lazy to look it up. Edit: I did look some of this up. I didn #8217;t see a clear connection to storms, and there may be other root words for typhoon, but there is a similarity between the two words. It #8217;s rather difficult to get a definitive story on mythologies as different sources contradict each other, and nearby cultures influence the stories as well. It is the nature of oral tradition to be ephemeral and changing.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Drought causes harsh sunlight (fire x1.5, water x.5), Drizzle causes rain (same but opposite). The **Primal** forms of Kyogre and Groudon have the weather abilities that cancel out fire or water moves. It was felt that Groudon got the better end of that feature, since it #8217;s primal reversion turns it from ground to ground/fire, and it #8217;s ability effectively makes it immune to a type that would do 4x damage (provided that Desolate Land doesn #8217;t get overridden by Primordial Sea or Delta Stream), and Kyogre doesn #8217;t gain an additional type and was already resistant to fire.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>If it #8217;s done cheaply or badly, it #8217;s usually pretty easy to tell. With implants, you can tell based on how they look in proportion to the rest of the frame, or by how they move (or rather by how they don #8217;t move). I #8217;ll admit I #8217;m not that great on telling if plastic surgery has been done to the face, until they go past the point where it #8217;s obvious.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>Upon learning that Dr. Horrible had feelings for a girl, he swore to sleep with her just to spite him. That #8217;s pretty evil if you ask me. Edit: Can #8217;t remember character #8217;s names #8230;</TEXT>

            <TEXT>Part of Firefly #8217;s magic is that it was nipped in the bud. Speculation about what a show could have been is 20 times better than lamenting that a show started good, and then went on for too many seasons. I still wish it could have been more, but I #8217;m grateful that it didn #8217;t end up like Lost which was so popular that they extended it out **way** past it #8217;s original scope.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>It not that he slept with his rival #8217;s love interest, it #8217;s that upon learning about that his rival was interested in the girl he happened to be dating, he immediately turned that interest into a weapon to hurt his rival. Evil is just as much about intention as it is about actions. You can accidentally release a demon without knowing what you #8217;re doing and not be evil, you might be stupid, but the act itself is not inherently evil. If however you know that it is a demon and you release it without a good reason to do so, then the act becomes evil.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>While adrenaline is a hell of a drug, you must have a pain threshold to rival that of my dad #8217;s. He was once up late working on some project. The drill he was using slipped and the bit went into the last knuckle on his pinky. It somehow missed both bones, but went through to the other side of finger. Everyone else was asleep so he disconnected the drill bit, grabbed a trash can, and removed the bit from his finger by twisting it out by hand. Then he disinfected the wound by pouring rubbing alcohol through it, wrapped the whole thing in gauze, and then woke up my mom (a former RN) who listened to that story and took him to the emergency room anyway.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>It #8217;d been a while since I had been to the store, and appeared that they had gone through a major remodel during that time. Instead of the open floor design that I was used to, the store was divided into three sections with big signs hanging over them. Curious, I decided I look around a bit.  #8220;Bed #8221; was the largest section, the floor covered in plush carpet that made it hard to move shopping cart, and there were beds set up at regular intervals for people to try. Along the sides were different types of bedding. The last third of the section displayed nightstands and dressers. I examined things for while before moving on. The next section,  #8220;Bath, #8221; was a little smaller, with a tile floor and #8230; Wait. Since when has this store carried bathroom fixtures? The left wall here was lined with sink displays, the back wall had toilets, and the right wall showed off showers and bathtubs. In the middle sat aisles of towels and accessories. I noticed a drip as I walked past one of the sinks. Functional displays? You never see that in retail. Eventually, I made my way to the last and smallest section,  #8220;Beyond. #8221; It was just a small section of shelves on a cement floor containing kitchen accessories, but as I browsed, I kept finding additional types of items. Vacuums, knick-knacks, grilling accessories #8230; More items than the space should have allowed. More shelves than there were aisles. I turned back, heading towards the entrance. There was just more aisles. I looked around. No walls. Just aisle after aisle of items for sale. Please, send help. I don #8217;t know how long I #8217;ve been in here. I can #8217;t find an exit, and I think I hear chanting. Edit: This is my first time posting a story here. Constructive criticism is appreciated.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>I remember as a kid being taught that multiplication was groups of addition. Like 5x10 is 5 groups of 10. It never really clicked with me until I was in college that exponents were to multiplication what multiplication was to addition. And then, I find out that that relationship doesn #8217;t stop at exponents. I forget the name, but the notation is stacks of exponents, and you get ridiculously huge numbers very quickly.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>Don #8217;t forget complacency. This didn #8217;t just suddenly happen. The seeds were planted long ago, but Americans haven #8217;t been watching our representatives thoroughly enough. As long as we had our entertainment/distractions we were happy. The best thing to come out of this presidency is that more of the people are keeping an eye on government. Even if the constant shifting news cycle is exhausting.</TEXT>

            <TEXT>Ok. A couple of things. 1. If you strip away the actual words being said and look at the core of what the republicans are saying about the Supreme Court nomination it comes down to  #8220;we are doing this because our party controls the White House and the senate, thus we can. #8221; That is also their reasoning for blocking the nomination of Merrick Garland. They did so because they could. My earlier question restated using that logic is: Do you think the Democratic Party, if they had the ability to do so, would hesitate to either block a nomination or force one through? 2. As for me phrasing that as a question so that you could not respond, no, that was not my intention. Prior to you calling me out on that, I actually hadn #8217;t thoroughly read the rules of this sub. I had mostly been skimming the sub to see what people thought. Having now reread those, my above comment, phrased as it was, might be a violation of rule three since it is probably not be a clarifying question. As it is already in place, I #8217;m not going to change or remove it, so if you want to try reporting it, that is up to you.</TEXT>
