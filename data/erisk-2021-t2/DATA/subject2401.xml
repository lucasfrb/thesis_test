    <TEXT>I've been trying so hard for the past 2 years.. the longest I've gone was 10 days streak and last month (Jan 2020) I did 20 days nofap but I'd never go 3 or 4 days straight.. however this February I've been fapping almost 2 or 3 times per day and I have no motivation whatsoever. I know I can be better but I can't suppress that feeling of horniness. Id always go to the TV and watch some explicit videos on YT or open the phone and watch P The scary part is I have no drive to quit this anymore almost as if it's becoming a part of me. And yeah it sucks. I just can't. Fucking. Keep. Living this way  #128553; Plus+ factors that I think may have contributed to this February being shitty: 1) I quit Instagram partly cuz of exams which is in another 70 days so I don't chat with a lot of ppl anymore and I find myself lonely 2) I don't go to school much and I'm mostly at home And also I'm stuck in the pmo cycle I don't know how to get out of it.. have any of you guys been where I am? How have you managed to get out of it and how has it improved your lives. I'd love to hear that :) Cheers  #127867;</TEXT>

I've been trying to quit for a while and what you achieved is a big deal, congrats  #128170; don't ever stop. And yeah I must develop my habits. Now that you said that when I look back what got me to 20 days on Jan was that I exercised EVERY weekday (except sat and sun) and had cold showers. So I do agree with the habit thing but this month I've been skipping workouts. Thanks for giving me more insight on this I hope one day I can come to your level and share our success</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-03 12:55:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alright so I just relapsed. Hear me out I got this girl who wanted to exchange nudes and i couldn't chicken out so in order to do that I obviously had to get hard right. Which led to M. I didn't O though. Shortly after that I kept edging cuz I still had that high which eventually lead to a relapse. My question to guys who have girls or guys that have some sort of sexual activity going on. How do you guys manage that and nofap? Do you guys simply reject any activity or is there a way of managing both sides. Lol it's like when you have a good streak you finally get girls and in order to make use of that you have to sacrifice your streak. :( Any ideas on this will be appreciated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So basically he got in to a relationship with a girl around 1 or 2 months ago (my point here it's not been that long) and he talked to me earlier today about this. Unfortunately for him he doesn't feel like she's "the one". But he do not want to come off as a douchebag while doing it so he asked me for any alternative options he could use to break off the relationship slowly. He wouldn't mind this girl being friends later onwards or anything, just that he doesn't want this to be a big deal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you're saying but you're coming from the wrong place. It's not right to go around telling people that they deserve to get hurt, not in this instance because OP clearly resents what he'd done. That accounts for a lot. There are millions of people out there who just get into a relationship because of sex (girls and guys both). And I believe Porn and society also plays a large part in that but you should appreciate the fact that he decided to change. This is where people come to change and they deserve a second chance. I'm sorry you had to go through that but spreading negative energy isn't the way. No one is born perfect it's about who we become. OP you are on the right path and bravo to that  #128588; keep going brother</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not alone. I discovered porn at a much later period compared to you (around 11-12) but I've been compulsively fapping from that period (for around 4-5 years). First it was softcore stuff it didn't even need to be a video (just partially nude pics) but later on i needed it to be more extreme and I can surely relate to your post. Id always be disgusted with myself after "doing the deed". I still haven't gone more than 10 days in a row but I sure have made progress. It always starts with the small stuff; workouts, daily plans, positive thinking, cold showers, socialising and I do recommend watching YouTube videos that talk about nofap. The fact that you decided to accept that this is a problem itself is a big step forward because trust me there are millions out there who would rather fap all day and disregard that porn is not harmful, now you just need to slowly make your way upwards and it sure will change your life forever :) P.S I recommend reading success stories on this subreddit it sure will help and I will DM you a few YouTubers who make videos about their progress on nofap. You're not alone. We're all in this together. Let's go!  #128170; Edit: i thought you were a guy at first and after posting this I saw the title properly, lucky for you there are females who's on this path as well :)) and remember it's never too late and I advise you to maybe join a course or DM individuals who conduct them because they do have a lot of insight on this subject and it sure will help you given the situation you're in</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How much power supply do I need for my pc please help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 06:14:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I do not have enough money to build a high end pc so I'm trying to build a budget pc. I've already chosen the basic components and paid the advance to the shop I sent the order to. This is my build if it's important: Processor: intel i39100f, Motherboard: MSI H310M Pro-M2 plus, Storage: 500 GB HDD and 1 TB hdd, Ram:8GB ADATA value DDR4 2666MHz memory module, 650va dcp high backup ups) ---And a 500w power supply--- As you can see I haven't mentioned the graphics card. Right now I only have a limited choice of graphic cards to choose from due to location issues and there's only a few shops I can access. My order consists of a GTX 770 2gb oc edition graphics card however this will take around a week and I'd rather not wait that longer. Thereby if I find a graphic card myself the only thing left would be to assemble the components and build the pc. I found a place near by which sells another GTX 770 except it has 3 fans and the description mentions it uses 450 W while the former has only 1 fan. I'm new to the whole thing and I want to know if my power supply is enough  #128517; should I buy a 550w if I'm buying the other gtx 770?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It says 404 website not found :/ anyway I tried Google.

    <TEXT>display went a while back and we decided its not worth trying to repair it plus we were facing some financial problems at that time. I had to disassemble the laptop yesterday because i could use the hard drive and while at i thought why not sell the other components since the laptop is not being used anymore. Basically everything is in good condition and it would be of great help if anyone here could state how much i could get as a return (for the motherboard, display, battery ect.)</TEXT>
