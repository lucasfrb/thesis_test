    <TEXT>What I mean is, what actor that you don't even like that much keeps showing up in movies that you like? For me it's Penelope Cruz. She's done some OK work but I can think of a couple hundred actors I like better. Her real talent appears to be an uncanny ability to select roles in what end up being some of my favorite movies.</TEXT>

The villain catches them at gunpoint from above and threatens to kill the protagonist who says something like "Ah ha! I thought about that that but you can't kill me because there would be a witness!". The villain says "Then I'll just kill both of you", and the protagonist says something like "Oops" and the woman says something like "What do you mean oops!?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like being poisonous would be a very popular survival strategy but that does not seem to be the case. Is venom expensive to produce or a danger to the animal making it, or is it too easy for predators to develop immune defenses to the toxins? I find it strange that most carnivores can eat almost any other animal.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TOMT][TV Show] Crew wakes up on enormous, malfunctioning space ship and slowly explores it looking for the bridge.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-18 08:31:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Old. 70s or 80s maybe. I think the ship was hit be a space rock or something. Just a handful of people wake up. Maybe they're not sure why they're there? They know they need to get it fixed, so each episode they search for the bridge or crew. Sometimes they run into other people, usually with delusions about why they're there. I think it only lasted one season if that. It was pretty poor quality but was kind of trippy. Not Space 1999 but in that sort of vein.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unknowingly ate a large amount of edibles</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-31 09:33:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>A long time ago I was managing a hot tub place in Santa Cruz which sometimes rents out after hours for private parties. We were closing up one night with such a party going on. They had set up a lovely table full of food and invited the staff to help ourselves. I was pretty hungry, so I ate a wonderful fat blondie. It was so good that I ate another. You can see where this is going. I remember the blondies having these strange green streaks, but didn't think much about it. After the private party ended and we'd finished cleaning up, I locked the place up and jumped on my bicycle for the 10 mile ride home. Normally I like those long drives in the quiet of the night, but this time it was strange. It seemed to take a lot more effort, like I was riding through honey, and my destination seemed to keep stretching further away. Eventually I make it home. I was alone and starting to get very worried. I could feel myself slightly hallucinating. I didn't see anything that wasn't there. Just things like the proportions of the house and the things in it all seemed much larger or smaller than normal. My stomach was also starting to cramp so I thought maybe I'm hungry, since all I'd had were those blondies. So I ate a carrot. But the carrot just sat in my stomach like a heavy fibrous lump. Then I started heaving into the toilet. First came the carrot followed by a bunch of dry heaves. I was starting to think I'd been poisoned and might be dying, but I didn't want to do anything rash just yet. I started shivering, so I got into bed and huddled in the corner to ride it out. As I reflected on what might have done this, I eventually remembered the blondies and suddenly I realized I had ingested a huge amount of weed. That's when my panic began to wane. I knew that however uncomfortable I was, I would eventually go back to normal and I'd be OK. That's around when my first roommate came home. He had worked there too, and while he had only eaten one blondie, he was tripping too. He stood in my doorway with a huge grin and asked me if I was high too. The main thing I remember was looking up and seeing him entirely filling the door frame like a giant, and maybe even hunching a little because he was taller than the room. When he stepped into the room he appeared to take up most of the space. He looked comically huge and we had a good laugh about the whole thing. On one hand, I'd been curious what it would be like to get unintentionally dosed, so now I know. On the other hand, 90% of it was *really* unpleasant. Supplemental PSA: I would like to suggest that we make it standard to expect weed edibles be colored bright green. I encourage everyone to put a drop or two of green food coloring in all batches of your edibles. TL;DR Ate two weed-laced blondies without knowing what they contained. Tripped balls for a few terrified hours before figuring out what had happened, and then rode it out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I'd like to know is if he's somehow restricted until this is settled. And if he can't deliver his report, then can he at least talk to members of Congress about it or offer them any suggestions if he likes? Similarly, are there any restrictions keeping Congress from subpoenaing his testimony or report? I've seen almost no analisis along these lines. [ABC News merely suggests](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-weigh-legal-options-russia-report-including-mueller-subpoena-n988206) the possibility of "Sending a subpoena straight to Mueller", but doesn't elaborate.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just found this sub and have to tell you about the day I changed some stoner's lives with sandwiches</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 02:21:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my 20s, I made subs for TOGO's. If you don't know TOGO's, it's what you'd get if Subway used only high-quality ingredients in decent portions. One day, two guys came in who were obviously blazing and starving. They were a little overwhelmed with the menu and asked for suggestions. I told them the main ones, but decided to have some fun with them and said I could also make a "Chef's Choice". "What's a chef's choice?" they asked. I said it's a large sandwich where I just throw in whatever random things I feel like. The first guy says "I'll take that!" so I proceed to line up the craziest things like corned beef, avocado, and tuna with all the trimmings while his eyes got wider and wider. Then I ask the second guy what he wanted and he said "I'll have a chef's choice too!", so he gets meatballs and turkey and egg salad. The results were these massive sandwiches that I'd certainly get in trouble for if I did that regularly. They walked out incredibly happy, and I bet they've been telling the story ever since, but probably nobody ever believed them because no sandwich shop would ever do that, and they were too high to trust their memory anyway. I just really like knowing that I gave two stoners a life-changing experience and found a sub that would appreciate the story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got back from seeing [it](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8367814/reference). It wasn't the worst depiction I've seen. The plants looked reasonable, and they clearly did some research, which is great. It's not a bad action flick with some funny dialog and entertaining cinematography. Written and directed by Guy Ritchie. All the characters had the same speaking pattern which was odd, and the plot is hard to follow, especially if high, but I recommend it. With Matthew McConaughey looking fine, Colin Farrell, and a very sexy Michelle Dockery. I'd like to know what you ents think about it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-07 08:08:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>1970s maybe? It was briefly popular in California at least. The man asks how he got to the island. The residents tell him he swam there. He lives there for months or years. He's told he can have anything he likes. He asks for the hottest woman and she says yes of course. He makes it almost a scientific quest to figure out what's happening. He carves his findings into the stones of a walkway for posterity. Eventually tires of paradise and wants to go back to his old life, and somehow he wakes up back in his world. The plot isn't much but it was evocative and mysterious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's only in the best possible case where any country is supplying aid to any other. But I think the premise is wrong by implying correlation as causation. Lots of things preceded past civilization collapses. Maybe rising hemlines always preceded collapse, but few would claim that they caused it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what I thought. The air quality for you probably only got increasingly better with the reformulated, lead-free gas and cleaner burning engines. My experience was the opposite where the air only got worse and worse. When I left it was normal to only get a glimpse of the other side of the valley after a storm cleared. Sometimes the orange smog was back the very next day. Being trapped in that air under an inversion layer was a hell I wouldn't wish on anyone but Trump.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I assume you're talking about entitlements, right? Social Security was created under Roosevelt, so my parent's generation "robbed" from mine the same as you feel mine is doing to yours. Only the first generation back in the 1930s got the unfair advantage of getting benefits they didn't pay for. Regarding housing costs and costs of living, my generation benefited by luck when the US entered WWII far too late and was left as the only superpower left standing. Medical costs have been skyrocking because the Republicans are in the insurance company's pockets. Even still, my generation managed to create the ACA which is the first major new entitlement since Medicare, so you're welcome.</TEXT>

If you are upset at wasting time, remember, you could have left any time you liked. I think you're just salty because you picked a losing argument.

    <TEXT>Not sure I'd call it fun, but that's what makes it an adventure. I was very much against it but one guy in our party of 4 pushing us to try it. Finally he said he'd just go in a way to see how bad it was, and after then we grudgingly followed. It was kind of torture, but the worst part was we'd left our gear inside the cave, so once we got out through that passage, he and one other guy went back in the main way to retrieve our stuff. It took them a really long time, and I started getting hypothermia from only having a t-shirt. The instigators wife kept me warm with direct skin-to-skin contact. When it took an hour more than we'd agreed to wait before going for help, we finally heard them after I yelled a final GOOD BYE! That was a close one in a couple ways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She was pretty cute too, so that made it awkward, but all of us realized it was the smart choice. One of the most interesting parts was when it was her turn with the cheese grater. She was the last one up and her wider hips were particularly difficult to get through. I was above her and a bit to the side, so I couldn't help her directly, so I would give her tips and encouragement as she struggled. She'd grunt and squirm for a while, and then she'd take breaks so it took 15 minutes or so total. During one of those breaks we were both perfectly silent, and I started noticing a faint far away pounding which I assumed was a pile driver or some heavy equipment. But then I thought that maybe it was my heartbeat, but I took my pulse and it was slower than that. Then suddenly I realized it was so quiet and she was exerting herself so much that I could hear *her* heartbeat from maybe 6 feet away!</TEXT>

You need to find the food they've discovered, and remove it. Often it's just poor packaging that they can easily avoid, so the next time you buy that thing, store it in some Tupperware or similar airtight container. Just do that, and the ant trails will remove themselves and not bother you again until you leave out some other treats to bait them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, that could be a very good reason too. Problem is the natural environment needs occasional wildfires for ecosystem health. When we put out all the little fires, then when the big ones hit, they're way bigger than the natural ones and can cause essentially irreparable damage. In short, it's simply not that clear what we should be doing beyond protecting people and property.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course there are traces of other ingredients. Since the only one you mention salt, you should know that salt is essential to most animals, and they'll often have trouble finding enough. These little guys are omnivores just like us and are probably doing just fine. In fact people like you who say any human food is bad for them are the same people who complain about overpopulation from the handouts. But if the handouts are causing their populations to explode, then the handouts are the opposite of unhealthy. You can't have it both ways.</TEXT>

Turns out your actual vision for what we should be doing is to keep doing what we're doing, so you're really not helping, but you think you're some sort of superhero anyway. And the moment you're put on the spot for how to achieve your techno utopia, you resort to insults just to mask the obvious fact that you haven't got a clue about how politics is done. Hopefully that's all just because you're 20 and that's normal at that age. Go to school, join some causes, and see how things really work.

It appears that even the [1929 crash suicides are just urban legend](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/09/why-aren-t-we-seeing-any-suicides-on-wall-street.html):  gt;Tall tales about panicked speculators leaping to their deaths have become part of the popular lore about the Great Crash. But although jumping from bridges or buildings was the second-most-popular form of suicide in New York between 1921 and 1931, the  #8220;crash-related jumping epidemic #8221; is just a myth. Between Black Thursday and the end of 1929, only four of the 100 suicides and suicide attempts reported in the New York Times were plunges linked to the crash, and only two took place on Wall Street.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As during the Great Crash, jumping was already the second most popular form of suicide. Of course people killed themselves over financial trouble. They always have, so listing a bunch of them proves nothing. The question is whether there ever was an epidemic of panicked speculators leaping from windows then or in 2008. Of the suicides you listed, many were done by other means, and there don't appear to be any that took place on Wall Street. We're simply talking about different things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have no understanding of what you are talking about and are probably just extrapolating from what you think you would do or want done in such a situation. What you *are* right about is that people who kill themselves are seeking an end to pain. You probably know that you'd want the same if you were ever in extreme and seemingly endless pain, and deep down you're glad that at least it's an option. Also, cowardness and bravery are not opposite sides of a coin. People in both cases are doing something terrifying and definitely do not feel brave. If they did feel brave, then it wouldn't require bravery. Cowardness is someone not doing something difficult that they know they should be doing and which most other people would do. That certainly doesn't apply to suicide which is someone managing to do something that few people could do. In short, the concepts of cowardice and bravery don't really apply to this situation.</TEXT>

Personally, I see this entire administration as illegitimate. It was done with close coordination with a hostile foreign country and should never have taken power. It's completely treasonous, which means even the death penalty is one possible outcome. I don't want the death penalty for any of them, but I want hundreds of them in prison and as much of their damage undone as possible. In no case should they be rewarded.</TEXT>

I think that's important because it makes it easier for them to make projections and therefore plan their strategies more effectively. Yesterday's $50 was a one-time bonus. I hate these pop-ups too, and more than that I hate knowing that I'll get a bunch of expensive junkmail. I wish there were a secure way to make anonymous donations, but that doesn't seem to be a thing, so like so much in politics, I just hold my nose and donate, vote, etc. because to not do those things is so much worse.</TEXT>

When I imagine myself in that job, I imagine that there would be a small number of really important races where I'd want to allocate every dollar I could, so if I'm suddenly given a windfall donation, I'd know exactly where to send it and would do that almost instantly. Personally, I've been making small recurring donations to them as I'm sure that's what they generally prefer, but this close to the election, they can probably make better use of that surge. That's why I made the extra donation to the DSCC yesterday, and the same to the Biden campaign.</TEXT>

You are correct that I don't want to lie, and I don't want my actions to be considered to be lies. My problem with lies by omission is the name since I don't feel it always involves deliberate attempts to deceive. Clearly it can be used that way, in which case I'd agree that it's a lie. But there are other cases where someone has the wrong impression not due to anything I've done, in which case I feel no obligation to straighten them out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are much better ways of judging mathematical abilities, but they tend to be very subjective and not things that would lend themselves to spectator sports. It's surprisingly similar to writing in that it's a very creative activity involving a highly trained instinct. Perhaps the best tests are hard problems from branches of mathematics that the competitors are unlikely to know anything about. You don't judge them by their solutions, because it's very unlikely they'll be able to solve such problems. Rather you want to judge them on how they approach these novel problems. You want to see what sorts of tools they try to invent to attack the problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is really weird. First, the first public allegation described in that linked story took place just around the corner from where I live. Then to learn that there have been several such allegations against him is strangely disturbing, even though it's exactly what I'd expected from nothing more than my hunch. I want to like the guy, especially as he's picked up Carl Sagan's torch, but he just always feels creepy to me. I definitely do not want to socialize with him in any way. And finally, your story links to [a Facebook post of his](https://www.facebook.com/notes/neil-degrasse-tyson/on-being-accused/10156870826326613/) that describes a long list of allegations towards himself that he attempts to whitewash but only makes worse. For example, he says that he never touched a woman who he had invited over for wine and cheese except for the handshake he gave her at the end. But then he says he had given her a "special handshake" that was so deep that he'll never forget it. And then he describes another time where he was accused of reaching inside a woman's dress but in his defense he was only looking for the end of a particularly intriguing tattoo of hers. I mean how are these things supposed to make them not seem creepy? Thanks for doing the search I should have done, and thanks for your concern about my being downvoted. I don't mind the downvotes because as I freely confessed, I had no evidence to back up my feeling, though of course now I do. Ew.</TEXT>

It so happens that I'm also an Android developer and have had most of my apps pulled by Google recently for reasons that are not clear what they want (eg privacy policy), and of course API 29 shenanigans. The one thing I will say is that I believe JNI is a pretty reasonable bridge. No idea how to do that via python, but it's worth searching around and especially asking on android communities on Stack Overflow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's why they are trying to do it through SCOTUS. Their own constituents woke up and realized they want affordable healthcare, so they're trying to go around them. Their constituents are also nervous enough to allow Biden to win, so they are trying to invalidate the election too. There is nothing they won't do to remain in power, because if they don't, a lot of them are going straight to prison.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hosted an after-hours party at a spa. The renters prepared a table full of food and invited us to eat what we liked. I only ate an excellent blondie, so I had another. My coworker/housemate did the same. Afterwards we closed up shop and I rode my bicycle home. That's when things started going sideways. I had no idea what was going on. Got home, had the dry heaves for a while and tried to decide if I was dying. After an hour or so of this I tried to figure it out and eventually remembered the blondies. They even had green streaks in them but we thought nothing of it. Eventually roommate came home with a big grin asking if I figured it out. I'm glad he was happy because I was miserable, but relieved that I wasn't dying. Wrapped myself in a blanket and shivered for a few hours until it started to subside. What a nightmare!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Californian? Source: am Californian. I've seen this process many times when people from other countries are shocked that we appear to make strong friendship bonds in very little time. Most of the rest of the world take many years of close association before accepting an outsider as a strong friend, and once that happens, it tends to be for life. When they encounter this nearly instant acceptance, they are often very moved to reciprocate, without realizing that we can drift away as easily as we can connect and are sadly very disappointed in the end. This is part of what I label as our "disposable lifestyles". We are often very willing to try on new lifestyles, get passionate about them, and then discard them for the next new thing. Unfortunately, people unfamiliar with this process end up hurt when it turns out to not be what they initially expected. In the end, we make close friendships probably as often and as slowly as anywhere, but we are often eager to try out new things in all aspects of life and easily forget some of the basic things about being human.</TEXT>

It was pretty awful for me of course, but I had always been curious what it would be like to get accidentally dosed, so at least now I know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can always cook with properly made cannabutter, but I believe 20 minutes is pushing the limits of decarbing, depending upon the temperature. More than that and you just start destroying too much of the THC. And while cooking cookies or brownies, the THC will bind to the fats just fine. In a lot of ways, less is more. Also, can I get a source on those Amsterdam practices? It's not that I doubt you, but recollections and second-hand anecdotes don't carry much weight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suppose Brita wouldn't improve the taste if your water is too soft. That's not a common problem, but if that's what you've got, maybe you can add a tiny amount of baking soda and possibly salt or other additive. Regarding plastics, even the recyclable plastics are mostly not being recycled because it's incredibly difficult and not cost effective. Also important to realize is just how much energy it takes to ship bottled water all over the world, especially as it's almost never better than what you get from your tap. Usually it's literally just municipal water from some other state, and they might be buying water from your municipality with at best a little extra filtering. Production of plastics also consumes incredible amounts of water. Bottled water is just a giant wasteful scam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's certainly not true that subsidies are the cause of your higher housing costs. Notice that I'm not saying that subsidies are the solution to vulnerable people being priced out of markets. I'm *only* saying that if the government wants to make it so that certain classes of people can afford to live in certain areas, that subsidies are the way to do that, but what doesn't seem to get asked is whether we buy the premise that we need to do that in the first place. Maybe we should pay those subsidies regardless of where those vulnerable people choose to live. In that case, few would choose to live in the most expensive locations since they can live much more comfortably elsewhere. This idea is nothing less than a UBI which I see as the only viable long-term solution since the vast majority of jobs are susceptible to being automated.</TEXT>

I suspect it's not that great for black women though, as blushing signals vulnerability which sort of makes people nicer to women because they can see our distress. That's why make-up generally accentuates this. Black women may therefore seem stronger than they feel, leading to worse treatment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You were corrected in this thread. Just read up a couple messages. Your logic is flawed. You're saying in essence 1. Dexamethasone may worsen clinical outcomes 1. Trump is taking Dexamethasone 1. Therefore Trump is at risk of a worse outcome You can't make that argument unless you know exactly which people 1 includes and doesn't include. In this case it refers to people much closer to death. Trump thrusting himself into that group of people taking Dexamethasone doesn't make him match that population. You could make the same argument about hospital food: 1. Patients who eat hospital food have an X% chance of dying. 1. I've decided to eat hospital food. 1. Therefore I have an X% chance of dying. See what I mean?</TEXT>

Just like with Biden, her instincts are to retain prohibition, but the larger culture is clearly for legalization, so that's now their position. Hypocritical? Yes. The right thing to do? Also yes.

    <TEXT>That's a very reasonable argument, except that we know a great deal about what's out there and what is physically possible. Even within our solar system, space travel is completely inimical to life. Probes are the way to go, as you can see with Mars. And although human colonies on Mars are not entirely impossible, even that looks like a terrible idea. I'm willing to bet that nobody will be living on Mars in the next 100 years. All the men-in-space stuff is purely romantic. Maybe some folks will eventually land, pick up a few rocks and quickly hightail it back to Earth, and that will be it for a long time, and perhaps forever. Drones/probes/rovers are the way to go. We can and should send them everywhere. People in space is largely just a stunt with essentially zero scientific value per dollar.</TEXT>

What if Everest had been twice as high and although robots could climb and explore it just fine, it took over $1 trillion to equip a person to do the same. Assume it would have to come out of NASA's budget and that it would mean they couldn't do anything else for 10 years. Would you still argue that we should do it? Also, terraforming Mars is not only a monumental project that we haven't a clue how to do, but there are still show stoppers even if it could be done. The reduced gravity makes it medically impossible unless you spend most of your life in a centrifuge. And the cosmic ray flux would mean you couldn't spend more than a month or so on the surface in your entire life. Still want to go?</TEXT>

It's good that you would volunteer to be a Mars mole man, but I don't want NASA's budget to disappear just for that. Personally, I'd much rather want to see autonomous submarines exploring the oceans of Europa and Enceladus, and rovers on Venus, Titan, etc. instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think these are the only options. I've created a hypothetical situation where that's the case in order to show you what you're missing which is that our resources are finite. I assumed that was clear when I said to imagine Everest is twice as high. You seem to want to believe we live in a world where we can have everything we want without limit. That the government printing money can always squeeze more work out of the population. That's simply not true. Come back to reality and deal with the harsh fact that we always have to make hard choices no matter how wealthy we are. Men-in-space are the most expensive space programs of all while returning the least scientific value for the cost. It's a terrible investment, but we continue to do it because the population consists of children with space dreams, and the science always takes a back seat as a result. Mars colonies are nothing but a pipe dream.</TEXT>

Yes, because it's unrealistic to expect to overhaul society, especially if the payoff is that we get to watch some astronauts go rock hunting on Mars.

Would you be willing to give up your hope of seeing those astronauts on Mars if it meant we exchange our bloated military for universal healthcare and a UBI?

    <TEXT>Good, then we're on the same page, and our only difference is in how we would allocate our finite resources. And yes, I think there is quite a bit of scientific value in space exploration, but exceedingly little in man-in-space projects. Toward that end, I think it's valuable to have the ability to have people service satellites, and I would like to see a permanent moon base, but the cost of the latter could easily swamp it's benefits, so we need to be ready to give it up. The future of space exploration is robotic. Even if our goal is to have an off-world base as a backup, sending humans to those bases should be the *last* step, not the first. Let the robots find the best locations and then build everything we'll need, and only then should we move in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the pattern we've been locked in for at least a century. It's almost inevitable given our constitution. The founders didn't even anticipate political parties, let alone a 2-party system, but that seems to be the result. One party takes the high road and tries to make everything good for everyone, and the other shows them what chumps they are by making it so easy to serve one's own interests at the expense of everyone else. That's oversimplified, but I think it's a good first approximation. The pattern perpetually oscillates because people quickly get bored with fiscal and social responsibility, so they put the Republicans in charge for some fun and maybe profit. Then they get a hangover and let the Democrats clean up the mess. Rinse and repeat. It's our own damn fault.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most importantly, don't go back to sleep after voting. Win or lose, it's important to donate enough that it stings a little, and to tell your representatives what you want from them. If you don't tell them, then they'll work for those who do. Don't feel like your one voice won't matter, because they already assume that for each constituent that tells them something, there are 10,000 others who feel exactly the same but didn't take the trouble to write or call. So if you do that, you are speaking with the voice of 10,000, and that definitely makes a difference.</TEXT>

For example:  gt;As Joseph Ellis notes in American Creation: Triumphs and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic, "the creation of a two party system succeeded **despite entrenched resistance by all the founders to its very existence.**" Yet emerge it did, in one of the most political fraught decades in our history, with resonance for the issues, divisions and rancor of today. They totally didn't want political parties to exist and *definitely* didn't want a 2-party system, but that's exactly what they got in the very first decade of our nation.</TEXT>

I believe there's a bit with a fake job interview where an unsuspecting applicant sits in a circle of chairs with a bunch of actors, supposedly waiting or something. Then they all stand up, so the guys stands up. Then they all stand on their chairs and he stands on his chair. There was exactly one applicant who refused to do any of the things the others did, but every other time they tried it, the unknowing person would follow every step, no matter how odd.

    <TEXT>You are right to feel bitter. I hold it against him and all the other liberals who felt no need to do this. I'm even more disappointed with Harris who is my senator and she famously rolled her eyes when asked whether she thinks we should legalize weed. But these things just make them normal in the Democratic leadership, and there is no other game in town, so we need to work with them to bring them along. Calling him one of the worst people in politics is going much too far IMO. Biden is famous for being a generally nice guy. The closest president in modern history who was a real dove was Carter. I didn't appreciate him at the time, so I'm endorsing Biden for being a nice guy in full earnestness. He'll draw a stellar administration around himself, and it will be indistinguishable from the Obama administration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They aren't fishing for any particular market. They're fishing for *The* Market. You think any fisher won't export if that makes more money? The Chinese learned from our example, so we can't blame them for that. We worked the Chinese to death building our railroads, then we'd shoot bison from the trains. The reason the bison are extinct in the wild. At least the Chinese didn't overfish for sport. If we want them to change, we first need to clean up our own act so we can lead by example once again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no ecological connection between our buying habits and tariffs. Tariffs only hurt the American consumer by forcing them to buy more expensive products that aren't any better than the Chinese. It favors some American industries at the expense of consumers and other industries. Just look at how Trump's trade war worked out. He's paid billions to soybean farmers just to keep them afloat, and it hasn't helped anyone one bit, except for soybean farmers in other countries. They probably love it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's obviously not cheaper to use other countries, or we'd have done it. Note too that all the countries in SE Asian countries together may not be able to match Chinese volume. Anyway, it's stupid and useless to blame others for doing what we pay them to do. If we want them to change, then we must be prepared to walk away. Otherwise it's just noise to make ourselves feel better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The consumers are the driving force. By analogy, your proposal is like expecting prohibition to solve drug abuse, but prohibition never works, and just leads to corruption on top of the original problems. The solution is for the consumers to move to a mainly plant-based diet. That or lower world population, but somehow that idea can't even be discussed, so we need to change our diets, and not because someone forces us to. That won't work. It has to be because that's what the consumers want.</TEXT>
