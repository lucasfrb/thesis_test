    <TITLE>Problems with windows 8 or my laptop</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-03-15 07:00:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi,I recently send my laptop to a guy to fix a problem about fan overheating,I send the laptop to him and then he gave it to me,It was fine,When i turned on the laptop,I noticed that it had Windows 8 pro. First i was like "Um,Neat!",I started using it and it was fine,But then i started downloading a game on [steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) (Team fortress 2 to be specific),I downloaded it and some my custom stuff,I stopped playing and restarted the computer,Appareantly there was a new update according to windows updater,I downloaded it and waited. But then i restarted my computer again and then i realised that my computer was slower,The first times that i booted the laptop it took like 10 minutes to get to the menu,But now it takes 30 seconds Also Appareantly this version of Windows 8 is 32 bits,And i have 4 GBs of ram,Maybe that could be a problem. Also a quick question,How many GBs does Windows 8 use?,Appareantly havei only 99.6 GBs in my whole computer **Specs** * Laptop : Pavillion G4-1362la * Processor :Intel i3-2330m 2.20 GHz * Ram memory : 4 GBs * Memory : 320 GBs * Screen : 1366 x 738 Pixels **Sorry for some spelling / Grammar mistakes.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm most likely getting an Armored vehicle mostly becuase of the fact that i need a Anti-explosive car. I'm guessing that the Kuruma is quicker than the Insurgent but the insurgent is more armored and holds more player.  gt; Why dont you get the Expensive Insurgent? For 3 reasons.  gt;1. I dont have friends,well,i used to have but they all upgraded to Next-gen. (I'm on PS3)  gt;  gt;2. I'm not really into causing havoc.  gt;  gt;3. I can Customize the normal Insurgent Opinions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TITTLE FIX :Can someone update me on what happened last year and tell me tips for an old player starting a new account? Hi. So like a year ago,i quitted TF2 And anything related to it and uninstalled Steam. And becuase now i have time to play TF2 And keep up with my personal stuff,,Im downloading TF2 And Steam. So it has been a year since i booted up TF2 and played it,and of course,a lot of stuff can happen in a year. Can someone give like a resume about what happened last year and maybe Community related stuff? I know that TEOTL was a massive piece of shit and that the Gun Mettle Update was like "CSTF2 The update." But Im talking about stuff like the market,Like Holy fucking shit Keys are like 13 refs and stuff like that. And becuase i lost my old email account that was attached with my old Steam account,im making a new account,can someone "train" me to be familar with the new weapons and stuff like that?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weird headphone jack problem</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-05 07:36:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>hello today i finally builded my pc and everything works fine except for one mistake that really bothers me so initially i plugged in my pair of headphones to the front 3.5 mm jack and i noticed they were EXTREMELY quiet and thought it was the drivers or something like that, i updated the drivers and it didn't help much, my headphones arent the problem because these work in my phone and i tryed another pair of headphones in this computer and it happened the same thing so after messing around for a bit i noticed something, so i was messing around with the, idk how to call it, the "audio balancing slider(?)", well, the thing where you control where the audio comes from (from the right, left or completely in the middle). like i said, the headphones were EXTREMELY quiet when i initially plugged them in, but after i moved the audio to come out of the right ear, the audio was completely fine for both sides, nice and loud, same with the left side, but when i turned it back to the middle, they went super quiet again. i don't know if this is a motherboard issue, or i didnt properly build the pc or just a software/driver issue, ofc i can just keep my audio in one side instead of putting it in the middle but i really would rather not. for reference, my motherboard is a[ msi z370-a pro](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fjPzK8/msi-z370-a-pro-atx-lga1151-motherboard-z370-a-pro), and this is the [rest of the setup](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/smessy/saved/kVKZRB) if this helps thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Various questions about Normal Assault Rifles and their Mark 2 variants</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-15 03:35:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>hello i just upgraded my pc and so started playing gta online again, haven't played since whatever update was after the heists one surprised about how much content has been added to the game since i stopped playing and i have a few questions **1. Is there an actual difference between the carbine and the special carbine** originally when i played this game i just trusted the stat bars that are showed in ammunation and such, but just now realized that game files are a thing. it says they're basically the same gun but reskined, is there an actual difference between the two, accuracy and range maybe? **2. should i upgrade any assault rifles at all to mark 2?** self explanatory, after doing a bit of research everyone reccomends upgrading the pump shotgun and the heavy sniper, maybe the combat mg too, but everyone seems to be a bit divided when it comes to the assault rifles **a few other smaller questions** are the game files trusted when it comes to gun stats? what's the typically reccomended rifle nowadays?, always used the special carbine but been thinking of switching for reasons, just looking at game files the bullpup seems like a straight upgrade but stats don't say anything about accuracy and i depend on that a lot so thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mouse recommendation for 19-9~ cm hands</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-01 00:48:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! So recently i've been thinking of getting a new mice to try something new out, i've had a g403 for a while (and before that a g203) and it's been pretty decent to me but my curiosity got the best of me and i've been looking at mouse reviews and such. I've been looking at stuff like the MM710 and the Model O-, i was very close to pulling the trigger on buying the MM710 but then a friend of mine bought one and was critical of mostly the clicks, the software and a tiny bit on the QC I'm still considering 710 as a possibility but mostly thinking getting something else, the O- came into mind and i can still get it but it would be *way* easier for me to get something out of Amazon. I have 19-9cm hands (more or less), my grip is inconsistent(?) but it's mostly a combination of claw and palm, and if it helps in anything i mostly have in mind playing shooters. Trying a lightweight mouse would be cool but not something i need, preferably lighter than my g403. Any recommendations?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well you can use them, nobody is really stopping you but you won't have: * the **massive** mobility buff you get out of having the gunboats * the insane amount of damage you can put out on short-medium range with rockets + shotgun banners mostly shine in stalemates (when you can somewhat safely farm banner meter) and post-uber exchanges or whenever the enemy med doesn't have uber (so you can actually use without just getting uber'd on and wiped) but the banner mostly sucks in mid fights where you mostly want to jump around (for either bombing, making space, get on an advantageous position to spam them out, etc), and whenever you don't actually have the banner meter ready, because with the gunboats and shotgun, you don't have to wait for a meter to fill up to get the rocket jumping damage reduction or the reliable hitscan damage from the shotgun, they're there for you no matter what banners are def viable and they can be round-winning, just not 24/7 and you have to coordinate with your team if you actually wanna make good use of it</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Multiple questions about game installs, drivers and dual booting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-28 02:53:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>hi, been thinking about trying linux as my main os (while having dualboot set up with hopefully my current install of windows in there just a backup plan if i try to play something that straight up doesn't work on linux or to go back to comfort) and i have a few questions questions about game installs and compatibility 1. i have a few games installed, i'm guessing for the games that aren't linux native, assuming i have steamplay, litrus or whatever other things i need are set up correctly, they should work right away? (for the games that are rated platinum in protondb at least) 2. and for the games that are linux native (like csgo and team fortress 2), do i have to install them again since the version i have installed is not supposed to run on linux? 3. i've done a bit of research on the distros available and it has mostly come down to ubuntu and pop\_os, but in the "migrating to linux" guide that is in this sub, it says that valve only officially supports ubuntu, i am aware that pop\_os is based on ubuntu but, is there anything i should be worried about with using pop\_os instead of ubuntu when it comes to game compatibility or in something else? 4. when it comes to nvidia drivers (my gpu is a 1060 3gb for reference), will there be any issues with drivers if i dualboot linux with windows drivers and viceversa? 3 questions about dualbooting and/or OSs 1. i've seen quite a few guides on how to dualboot windows and ubuntu, but i was wondering if there was a guide in here aswell just to read it aswell just to make sure everything i've read is correct for whenever i actually set up everything 2. how does the "install alongside windows 10" ubuntu install option work exactly, do i have to open bios and change boot order everytime to change os? 3. if i'm thinking of dualbooting no matter what, should i just not bother trying linux gaming and just boot windows whenever i try to play something not linux-native? or is the task of switching OSs too tedious to justify doing it regularly i'm not quite sure if making a standalone thread was the right thing to do instead of posting all the questions in the tech support thread, but felt like it was too many questions at once for me to just dump it in the tech support thread either way thanks in advance and i apologize if some of these questions were something that could've been googled or not clear enough to answer</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; It #8217;s comfortable, and any sort of pain I #8217;ve had went away, but couldn #8217;t aim. then learn to aim like that. no kovaaks score is gonna worth the long term issues that come with wrist problems like carpal tunnel and rsi. the fact that you already experienced pain before all this is a sign that you should've at the very least spent less time in kovaaks, if not taken a break from kovaaks/videogames in general</TEXT>
