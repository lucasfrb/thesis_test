    <TEXT>I #8217;ve always had emotional eating and binging issues. A crummy day or someone making fun of me would always end up in me tearfully cramming anything I could find into my mouth. My parents would have to hide the chocolate chips when I ran out of my own sugary foods. We had many arguments about how I would eat half of a jar of high-end cherry jam, just to get that little serotonin rush. Although I kept thinking  #8220;Frick it, I don #8217;t care about myself, nothing matters, Ill just keep eating #8221;- it adds up. And I DID care about myself and how I looked. A lot. Which made me feel worse, and the cycle continues. After eating healthily for a few consecutive weeks and working out daily, the most satisfying thing is to look into my fridge, see all kinds of delicious foods, and be able to walk away- somehow, without a craving. Without feeling the impulse to eat as much as I can of it before my parents see. I #8217;ve learned better ways to deal with my emotions, and I am changing as an entire person!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Call Me By Your Name fandom. It #8217;s a visually stunning movie and has a good plot line/general vibe, but stops there. It #8217;s a good movie! However the fandom is where the average viewer stops in its tracks. Most of it is teen girls who fetish gay guys and mlm, the same way lots of men fetishize lesbians. I #8217;ve even seen a girl rant about how the movie led her to having a  #8220;thing #8221; for gay sex and how she actively seeks that stuff out now. If it was a movie with wlw we know it would not have as much traction in that demographic. It #8217;s a shame :/</TEXT>

I obviously don #8217;t have time to watch everyone, but does are there any ones that are especially fun to watch? Thanks!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This probably doesn #8217;t help because I don #8217;t know the episodes, but in one he spoke about his history coding games as a kid, hacking games for money, etc etc. His million sub special I think he spoke a bit about irl stuff, and if you watch his  #8220;secret stream #8221; on youtube he answers a few questions. He also has a few old  #8220;Q and A #8221; LP episodes while he caves.</TEXT>

As nice as your home is, eventually you'll want an upgrade. You're gonna want something bigger. And random house fires are very hard to explain to insurance companies. But.

    <TEXT>i was watching etho #8217;s short lived hermitcraft season five series today. i love to collect clips from his videos for compilations, but it would be many times per video that i would want to stop and save a part. maybe it #8216;s quarantine, but i #8217;m seriously enjoying etho #8216;s videos so much more. :) specifically with season five, it #8217;s so much fun to just see the NHO (bdubs, etho, docm, and beef) having fun together and just playing the game. although they #8217;re all video makers and aware they #8217;re making content, it does feel like i #8217;m just spectating a group of guys playing minecraft and having fun together, and it #8217;s awesome. do you guys have a favorite series he did you like to revisit? because this is definitely my favorite of his.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yo i came here because the same thing is happening to me! i made a video that was a joke about last night #8217;s presidential debate. when i click the likes it shows a hundred or two hundred profiles, but it appears to have around ten likes. i also keep receiving comments too. very weird and frustrating. this happened to me a while ago but it was because i was getting a few thousand views in a very short amount of time, so it was  #8220;clogged #8221; and after a few minutes it caught back up. but it #8217;s been hours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i just wanna say. u guys are great. a few months ago i wasn #8217;t doing well at all and i guess i had- what you could call a hyperfixation? on ethoslab and mindcrack and hermitcraft. all day i #8217;d talk to people on this reddit, make art, and listen to etho #8217;s videos. it #8217;s all i could think about. i guess it was like an extreme coping thing haha. everybody in this community is super kind and it was awesome to always have friendly people to chat with and speculate and critique the silly art i would draw. probably the most positive community i #8217;ve ever been in thanks guys you all are the best  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i actually privated the video yesterday and unprivated it today and it jumped up to its true 400 something likes. i definitely think you #8217;re right though. it #8217;s possible there were so many videos under the debate tags that it was glitching out.</TEXT>
