    <TITLE>Question for men with long hair.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-16 05:16:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always wanted long hair, so I started growing it out a few months ago. Right now its in that awkward phase where its neither long nor short. The hair is about 5-6 inches long. My question is, how do I deal with the messy hair after I wake up in the morning? I can't tie up my hair cause it isn't that long yet. I have straight hair (just an FYI). Edit: Presently I just apply a little bit of water and comb. Should I be doing that?</TEXT>

Is there anything I should do be doing to stop it from getting greasy? Or does hair normally get greasy after 3 days?

Is instinct a behaviour trait at all?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've figured out the SOP for efficiently preparing chai that satisfies all the preferences and requirements (sugarless, strength etc.) of my family members, and because of this nobody else prepares the chai anymore.. Even if they do, it seldomly satisfies my tastes. The process takes about 20 minutes of staring at a boiling vessel and ensuring that it doesn't spill over. And God forbid if the vessel is smaller than the usual one - in which case I have to keep it on low flame for the whole time which adds to the total steeping time. It's a boring task and I wish someone else did it better than me so that I don't have to (-_-) Although Ma appreciates the tea once in a while which is wholesome I must admit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gave my exam a couple of days ago and passed with AT/AT/AT/AT/AT</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-28 04:20:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started thinking about getting the PMP in March/April this year. Initially I bought a set of videos that were basically a person narrating the ITTOs because it was really cheap and I wasn't sure of my interest levels at that time (it's from the provider called Whizlabs, if you're interested; it's really cheap, but I wouldn't recommend buying it). Took about ten days to finish that series. Then I took an instructor led training in the month of May from a local provider. The training was for 9 days and in the end I had recordings of the sessions. I started studying seriously (6 hours a day) about 3 weeks prior to my exam date. I would watch the recorded sessions from the training and then read the corresponding chapter in the Rita book on the same day. Finished both the book and the recordings in about ten days. Then I started reading the PMBOK.. it's probably the driest book that I have ever read in my life. But I finished reading it nonetheless and it did help me out a lot. A lot of the content in the PMBOK is repeated and/or paraphrased and reading the same thing over and over again kind of subconciously solidifies concepts. This took about ten days. I gave the PMI mock test and got a 65%. After finishing PMBOK, I did another round of the Rita book which was a quicker iteration cause I had already read/listened to the things being said in the book. This took me about 6 days to finish. The last 3 days prior to the exam I pretty much only solved mock tests and whatever questions that I could lay my hands on. I did three PrepCast tests, the test from openpm.org and the PMI mock test again. At this point I scored 81% average on PrepCast, 75% on the PMI test and 85% on the openpm test. I took an in person test as the center was pretty close to my place and I did not want to take any chances with the proctored test from home. I was in the zone and just kept answering questions and I marked close to 60 questions for review in total. Used up all the 4 hours and I even had 3 more questions left to review when the test ended. Immediately the congratulations message pops up. Pretty underwhelming to be honest :P My suggestions: 1. Do atleast 3 iterations of the books of your choice; it doesn't necessarily have to be the same book 3 times. I did 2 rounds of Rita and one round of PMBOK. Each round the reading becomes easier and quicker and you will start noticing patterns and retain more information. I went through the topics in the syllabus around 5 times if I include the videos. 2. Do not spend time memorizing ITTOs. It's just not worthwhile. There were absolutely no direct ITTO questions in the exam. I did not even memorize the planning processes that the Rita book advocated. As you spend time going through the syllabus multiple times, things become clearer to you. 3. Solve at least 1000 *good quality* questions. The Rita book has 400 and you most definitely should take the PMI mock test. 4. I felt the questions were more difficult than PrepCast. The grammar and style of writing is definitely much more different than PrepCast and more closer to the PMI mock test. But I think it was a good combination of easy questions and tough questions where multiple choices could be the answer. 5. I read aloud when I was initially started reading the PMBOK. I think it helped me to stay awake through the process. 6. The tips and tricks that the Rita book mentions are quite useful so make sure you go through them. I don't think there is any benefit in memorizing the planning process chart though. But do play the process game a few times and get to know what tasks go into which process group. It definitely helps. 7. The math based questions on the exam are really really simple. If you know the logic behind the formulae, those questions are a cakewalk. I had about 4 to 5 such questions on the exam. 8. Pay attention to the flow charts in the beginning of each ITTO in the PMBOK. Again, no need to memorize. Iterate multiple times to get the concepts right. 9. *READ THE QUESTIONS PROPERLY*. This is really important. I noticed there were a lot of curveball questions on my exam. Honestly speaking, if you do multiple iterations of study according to the exam outline in different mediums like books and videos and audio and solve about 1000 *quality questions*, you should be good. Your PM experience will definitely help but of course you need to keep in mind that you are working for a large project when you are taking the exam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So mom is making some [Avalakki](http://foodofinterest.com/avalakki-chivda/) which requires Hing as an ingredient. We only had had a large chunk of Hing and I used a mortar and pestle to powder the chunk, which involved picking up pieces of Hing that fly out of the mortar and putting them back in. Now, this is some special strong ass Hing that mom procured from a Hing peddler from an obscure town. I successfully pulverize the Hing and proceeded to take a shower. The fuck up is not thoroughly washing my hands prior to taking the shower. Of course while taking the shower, I run my hands all over my body and face and Dove soap doesn't have that strong of a fragrance (very neutral in that matter). I proceeded to dry myself with a towel and I can smell the goddamn Hing on the wet towel. I then realised that my whole body smells of pungent Hing and I have no idea how long this unique fragrance of my body is going to last.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all you need to build up a lexicon of smart and philosophical words, which when used will create an appearance (a facade almost) that you are an human being capable of intellect and critical thinking. The velocity with which you are able to find flaws in the arguments of the person at whom your arguments are directed towards, will determine whether you will have the upper hand in the conversation/debate, and having this upper hand in the conversation is of the utmost importance as it will prove to the reader and to those who are witness to the conversation of your intellectual superiority. Stringing sentences by making extensive use of commas can be used to create confusion and obfuscate the harsh realities of your own character flaws.</TEXT>

I used to go to this nursery called Little Angels and the uniform was cream colour shirt and bright red overalls. My favourite chair to sit in was a bottle green coloured one. During Holi nursery me the teachers used to hang a matka filled with candy and a kid used to break the matka and all other kids used to scramble to gather as many candies as possible. I picked only two, one for myself and one for my brother and go back and stand away from the crowd completely satisfied.</TEXT>

The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force is transformed, by a connecting rod and flywheel, into rotational force for work. Until the early 20th century, coal was the world's favorite fuel and it powered everything from trains and ships to the ill-fated steam planes invented by American scientist Samuel P. Langley, an early rival of the Wright brothers. A fire where the coal burns. There will be a boiler full of water that the fire heats up to make steam. A cylinder and piston, rather like a bicycle pump but much bigger. Steam from the boiler is piped into the cylinder, causing the piston to move first one way then the other. This in and out movement (which is also known as "reciprocating") is used to drive... A machine attached to the piston. That could be anything from a water pump to a factory machine... or even a giant steam locomotive running up and down a railroad.</TEXT>

I'm saying that differing opinions are enough to offend the person you're talking with and categorise you. I'm not talking about any particular case here. Generally bol raha hu. Bottomline is that they don't know you well enough nor do you know them well enough to take the consideration the greyness of each other's personality. That's the collateral damage that you have to consider if you are having a discussion where anonymity is involved.

    <TEXT>Accha waise Everyone wants to belong somewhere. It's comforting even if it means bringing the other person down. Aap aise nahi karte it's good. But to expect that out of everyone is unrealistic. Is the behaviour good? No. The individual gets lost in the opinions of the group. I know im sounding like I'm justifying the behaviour, and I'm trying not to as much as possible. I'm trying to say that this is how things are and you should accept that first and then think of ways you want to deal with it. How you want to take it up further is left to you. I personally prefer to not engage and try and focus my energies on the real world (I'm not saying you don't).</TEXT>

I understand what it feels like to be misunderstood and it fucking sucks that people don't care enough to take the extra step to understand who I am and what I'm actually trying to say. The sad things is that it's not going to change and I have to cope with it somehow. Unless of course I want to be the one who brings about the change. If that's the case then I will have to deal with it na? Is it a good system? No it is not. Do I want to do something about it? If yes, there will be things to deal with, if no then there will be things to deal with.</TEXT>

Fir se bolunga, it's not easy to explain one's self to others. Dheere dheere hota hai ye sab. Koi relationship ek hi din me nahi banta, ye aap already jaante ho. Online me cheez aur bhi mushkil hai. Again I'm not justifying anyone's bad behaviour. I'm just trying to tell you ki koi coping mechanism banao kyuki reality yeh hai ki that we have to deal with it. Please take those slurs with a pinch of salt. Just because someone says you're a misogynist based one comment with very little context, doesn't mean that you are one bhai :)</TEXT>

Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852) started the first kindergarten, Garden of Children, in 1840. According to Froebel Web, the word kindergarten was invented by Froebel and symbolized his vision for early childhood education:  #8220;Children are like tiny flowers; they are varied and need care, but each is beautiful alone and glorious when seen in the community of peers. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't stir. ___ When we need to "stir in" ingredients, our brain takes that literally to mean swirl in a circular motion. For most recipes that's correct, but where it's not is with (usually asian) noodle dishes. The best way to do this is to pick up everything and drop it back down. Tongs will help with this, and you can even use chopsticks. Grab noodles, do a bit of a shake, then drop them back down. Keep picking up clumps of noodles along with other items then drop them back in. This does 2 things: 1. breaks the noodles apart and 2. Mixes the ingredients into the individual noodles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like any big city, Rome was both a single idea and infinitely splintered reality - each street part of a system, every neighborhood a building block of the metropolis. And as in any big city, the ways its inhabitants experienced part and whole must have varied. Unfortunately, despite all the vivid detail provided by the letters of Cicero and the epigrams of Martial and Juvenal, our literary sources really tell us only how Roman elites liked to think and talk about life in Rome - potentially a very different thing from lived experience. Archaeology brings us closer to the sweat and dirt, but often merely in the sense of establishing the essentials of the physical setting. Your question, in other words, ain't easy to answer. But I'll take a wild stab at it. Rome was indeed big - by ancient standards, almost unimaginably so, to the point that it strained even the High Empire's ability to requisition resources and funnel them into Italy. But for its size, the city was quite dense. Most Romans famously lived in insulae - apartment blocks - three or four stories high, built cheek-by-jowl along every street and alley (building regulations stipulating space between apartments were blithely ignored). The five or so square miles eventually enclosed by the Aurelian Walls contained the great bulk of Rome's million inhabitants. Almost no part of the city was more than a few miles from any other part; and if you knew where you were going, you could probably walk almost anywhere in little more than an hour. Unless you want to count the litters occasionally hired by members of the elite, there was no public transportation (with the exception of construction carts, in fact, all wheeled traffic was banned from the streets for most of the day). But that didn't matter, since from any given neighborhood, a sufficiently determined pedestrian could walk almost anywhere worth going in a relatively short time. Although we have no way of proving (save by analogy with early modern European cities), it is likely that most Romans, like most premodern urbanites, worked near their residences. Local ties were strong in Rome, as the existence of the 265 vici (neighborhood organizations, each with its own magistrates and public cult) suggests. (One might also point to the odd festival of the October Horse, during which representatives of two neighborhoods competed for the head of the eponymous animal.) It should be remembered, however, that the great festivals of the Roman calendar brought all Romans into the ritual centers of the city, as did the combats in the Colosseum and the races in the Circus Maximus. Although Romans probably spent most of their lives in their neighborhoods, they would have never have forgotten that they were residents of a single city, and could never have doubted that their city was the greatest on Earth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I generally don't drink alcohol but I can't resist naturally made booze like Toddy. When I was in Nepal I had three different such drinks that I absolutely loved 1. Tongba - this is actually the name of the container and not the drink. It is a tall aluminium tumbler with a straw that is closed but perforated on one end and it acts as a filter. The source of the alcohol is fermented millet (I'm not sure of the process of fermentation). About a handful of it is added to the tall glass and it is filled with hot water and allowed to sit for 5 minutes after which it is ready to drink. Very nice buzz which is akin to that of beer. Tastes slightly sour. I had it with a side dish that is made of dried buffalo meat which is stir fried with onions tomatoes and chillies. Heavenly stuff. Once you get done with the glass, you can top it up a couple more times with hot water until the booze runs out. 2. Chhang - this one looks white/milky in colour and is made from rice of a particular variety. The buzz is also similar to that of beer but made my chest feel really warm! Really nice during the winters I think. 3. Raksi - this is a clear distilled alcohol and by far my favourite. Drinking this made me feel really really happy that too from the inside :D it tastes great on its own and also when mixed with mountain dew. I had about 90ml I think and I was in that euphoric state for about 4 hours with a grin plastered on face all the while. 10/10 stuff Raksi is. Best thing is that these local home made booze is much cheaper than the manufactured ones. So you can drink.more xD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People are risk averse because people do not know what will happen in the future. In a country like India, a poor person or even a middle class person can get fucked by taking one wrong decision. So it's unfair to put the blame on people for being risk averse. India doesn't have an environment that is conducive for an average person to tak risks. Besides he/she will also hve to think about leading a life in the same system in the future and that needs money. Not everyone can spend years on research. Some people will have to start earning as soon as they get out of college and some even as soon as they get out of school due to their responsibilities. A holistic education system should and will ideally teach the value of failures and lessons learned and pretty much all the points that you mentioned above.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you are saying is anecdotal. It doesn't really show the complete picture. Education enables a person to think critically. That means that that person's children will have a higher likelihood of being able to think critically. Good education will solve the root cause of the problem which is the societal problems that you mentioned in the other comment. Also there is nothing wrong in people looking for validation. If that makes them happy then who am I to say anything to them or look down upon them? We all have flaws. Let them be. There are much bigger problems in society than them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I say holistic I don't mean the infrastructure should be excellent. infrastructure is just one aspect of it. Good teachers who want to be teachers and are paid handsomely for their services so that they dont get pissed off with their stressful jobs (think of a govt school teacher here, not an MIT professor) so that they can do their job well. Some focus on happiness and living together as a community should be given. Teaching children not to hurt others by using slurs or things like that. Try to imbibe empathy and development of emotional intelligence. Teaching children about self introspection and the importance of doing things for yourself without stepping on other peoples toes. All these things can create good people who will improve society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You talking about your college mates and their desire to crave for validation is anecdotal. I agree that the way society is right now causes more harm. What I am saying is that with good education these problems can be alleviated to some extent if not completely solved. US, Israel, or any other country is not india. They might be examples but there are so many differences. Circumstances were different when they started to "develop". I'll say this again there is a lot of common things in what we are discussing here. I definitely agree that society problems are one aspect of it but it should not be restricted to risk taking abilities or the need for validation. There are other societal problems that are the root cause of these problems and that can be alleviated by good education.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree to that. What I'm saying is that ~10% will go down eventually as each generation is well educated. Trickle down effect will definitely happen. Society will improve (some other problems might arise, but that's a different conversation) as people get more and more educated. It needs to start with one generation and we will be able to see the effects only in the subsequent generations. It's not going to happen anytime soon unfortunately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People burdened by different problems will have less mental capacity to innovate. Is it possible? Yes it is but not in great numbers. Maybe one in a million or so or even lesser. Those odds can be improved when good education is available to all. For that to happen should society make changes? Yes - that's the large common part of our Venn diagram. Will that happen when one generation hasn't got good education? The odds are very very low imo. Will we see it in the future? With good education the odds will increase, imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One last post before I go to sleep and this is not as a mod but as a normal person. All of us have a lot in common than we think. It's just that we tend to focus more on our differences. We need to build on those common things rather than our differences. Look man, we gotta live together as a community.. in order to do that we need to understand that the persona that is portrayed online is not the complete picture. One comment, post or opinion doesn't define all of our personality. We are all more than that. Maybe if we ALL took the effort to get to know and understand this seemingly hidden parts of each other, the world probably would be a much better place. And I'm not talking about one person, I'm talking about all of us working together by setting aside our egos for atleast a short while. Individually all of us are inconsequential, but together as a community we are not. Shubh raatri  #128591; P.S : check this episode of Joe Rogan with James Maynard Keenan of Tool. He talks about an interesting exercise where a group of people sit face to face in a room and start off by talking about things we agree upon and build upon that. By the end of it, we'll definitely have a different opinion of a person than we would've if we started off with our differences. https://youtu.be/9-w-LFBw8Co</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have not said that empathy is universal. I said that in this situation empathy was offered. Actually if it would make it better I'll take off the word empathy. Agar aapko empathy na mil rahi hai to ye baat nahi hota hai ki dusro ko bhi na mile. It is unfortunate that people don't empathize with you the same way they do so with other people. People should work on being better. Initial reaction was that she shouldn't have posted the screenshot. That was not right and it could've been done in DMs.</TEXT>

The problem I had was that both of you made it about yourselves and deviated from mydesign. Pussys comments have been discussed by mods and i think sappu even reported it to the admins (not sure of that part). He definitely warned the user. Please don't say that we're not concerned that the women of this group are being harassed by some people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Khud ke advise le lo aur stop categorising yourself into left and right. It does no good. Biases definitely exist. I'll be a fool to not accept that. In the end whatever a mod does (bans, blocks, approves etc) will always be taking sides. And those will always be dictated by biases. This is not a court of justice nor are the mods equivalent to judges in a court of law. Please stop expecting that. Community accha lagta hai raho ya to mat raho. And that community also includes the mods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Muttatti itself is a dirty touristy place but has a lot of potential if maintained well. There's a river flowing through and it could be very scenic. Take the Dharwad to Goa road, stop at castle Rock railway station and explore the forests by foot. Be careful of snakes though xD There's an island in Raichur district who's name I can't recall right now. It was used by a sage as a retreataway from people so that he could meditate. There's a temple and you can even go into the cave in which he meditated. You can stay in the temple premises, there's lodging facilities which is really cheap. But yeah can't really indulge in intoxication over there. Marawanti beach which has a river flowing next to it separated by a road. Jog falls for sure. Not sure if it is possible to get to the bottom of the falls anymore but it's worth exploring. Especially when it's in its full glory. It is magnificent. Hampi if you want to chase intoxicants. Nagarahole and Bandipur forests. I'd suggest Muddumalai over Bandipur (Muddumalai is in TN and Bandipur is in Karnataka and it's separated only by a checkpost). If you are starting from Bangalore, just get a bike and ride towards Kanakapura and Chamarajanagar and explore trails. Chamarajanagar to Kodaikanal stretch going through the Dhimbam Ghats is BREATHTAKING. There's a table top mountain enroute and it's a sight to look at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I agree. I'm aware of the conflict between humans and elephants in Karnataka. As you said there's been many cases of elephant related deaths and there are so many cases of elephants entering into farmlands that electric fences are a very common sight in a lot of rural areas near forests. Rest assured I do not want to venture too close to an elephant. Maybe a sight from afar that's all. I will never attempt to go into a forest at night without expert supervision. That would be really foolish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Product companies are more towards research and development. If that's the environment you like then go for it.. Infy, tcs, wipro, Accenture etc are all mostly service based companies (they might have some departments that are focused on research also maybe but most of their money comes from services). Different skills are required to manage these two types. Product based it helps to have some knowledge of coding and all that (people have done well without that too of course, it's not a hard and fast rule). Can you earn well in either? Yeah I definitely think so. Opportunities are there in both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also any experience is good as long as you can put it on your resume. Future me IT to rahega hi, there is no doubt about that. Sab kuch digital ban raha hai. Service industry me mostly procedural type ka kaam hota hai. You'll have to manage these processes and coordinate with clients. Zyaada kuch technical nahi hota and you can do well with a high level knowledge of the tech that the company is working on. Pay depends on the company. Glassdoor pe review padh lo about company to get an idea about their culture and all that.</TEXT>

One day the 5 year old me was just walking around the complex and for some reason I started looking up at the sky and walking around without paying attention to what was in front of me. I ended up stepping on chubster Sheroo and startling him. He was such a sweet dog, he just saw my face and went back to sleep.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My brother and cousins were assholes sometimes. When I was 8 or 9 years old, a cousin had gotten a dart board (not the magnetic ones that you get these days) that still hangs on the wall at his house. The cousin wanted to show off the new board to his friend but there was no where to hang it yet. So we went to the terrace and they asked me to raise and hold the dart board in my hands while they threw darts at it. The first two darts were fine but the third one hit me in the neck and missed my jugular by an inch or two. Thankfully nothing happened and I probably bled about two drops. We used to play fight WWF moves and my brothers and cousin's favourite move to use on me was the chokeslam while they allowed me to pedigree them. I took the full blow while they protected their forehead with their palms. All of this was on a bed of course except for that one time where I was chokeslammed on the floor and I ended up passing out for ten minutes. They bought me ice cream afterwards and made me promise not to tell mom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sed song ____________________________ I can not say I know you well But you can't lie to me with all these books that you sell I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world I'm just trying to leave something behind The words have come from men and mouse But I can not help thinking that I have heard the wrong people When all the water is gone my work will be too And I'm trying to leave something behind Oh, money is free but love costs more than our daily bread And the roof is hard to access Oh, the future ahead is broken and red But I'm trying to leave something behind This whole world is a foreign land We swallow the moon, but we do not know our own hand We're running with the case, but is not gold However, we are trying to leave something behind My friends who I think are in the wrong fight And I can not read what I have not written I've been at home, but the teacher is gone But I would like to leave something There is a beast that has taken my brain Can you put to bed, but you can not feel my pain When the machine has taken the soul of man It's time to leave something behind Oh, money is free but love costs more than our daily bread And the roof is hard to access Oh, the future ahead is dead So I'm trying to leave something behind I feel I'm still on the shore And the pockets do not know what it means to be poor I can get through the wall if you give me a door So I can leave something behind Oh wisdom is lost somewhere in the trees You will not find in a little mental gray hair It is closed from the hurrying ahead And it's time to leave something behind Oh, money is free but love costs more than our daily bread And the roof is hard to access When my son is a man who knows what I mean I was just trying to leave something behind I was just trying to leave something behind __________________________________ Alexa play Sean Rowe to leave something behind</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aryabhata, the first satellite built by India, was launched on April 19, in the year 1975. Aryabhata was built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polygon with a diametre of 1.4 metre. The 360-kilogram satellite built by ISRO was launched by Russia from their Kapustin Yar rocket launch and development site using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. The agreement between India and the Soviet Union directed by U.R. Rao in 1972 allowed the USSR to use Indian ports for tracking ships and launching vessels as a token for launching Indian satellites. The satellite had its data receiving centre in Bangalore, where a toilet was converted to serve the purpose. To commemorate the event, both India and Russia released commemorative stamps.</TEXT>

That feeling of ~~disappointment~~ rejection takes some time to go away. But at the same time when things succeed your confidence will also increase. I still lack confidence but getting better and you will too :) just keep in a corner of your mind that it's not the end of the world.
