    <TEXT>It would help if you could be more specific about what you're struggling with. Making an active item is no different to making a passive item except you use active tags in your items.xml file (search through the games' items.xml for an active item and you will see some of the different attributes you can use) and in main.lua you put your logic in the MC_USE_ITEM callback instead of the MC_POST_UPDATE. I hope this gives you a starting point to work from, if you have any more specific issues feel free to reply to this or pm me and I'll try to help. Another very useful resource is other people's mods, go download someone else's active item and look in their main.lua file for how they did it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have the api documentation in front of me, and can't really look as I'm at work, but I seem to remember there is a Revive() function or similar in EntityPlayer. Perhaps in the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback you could check your hearts with player:GetHearts() (you will also have to check soul and black hearts)and if it is 0 and you have the item then revive. Like I say this is just off the top of my head but this is the way I'd approach the problem if there really isn't a way to add extra lives. When I have the chance I'll check the docs and see if I can help further</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In fact I don't think you want this to be in EVALUATE_CACHE either, it should be in MC_POST_UPDATE. Put everything except your first and last line of code inside a function called PostUpdate, and change your callback like so: local DullKnife = RegisterMode("DullKnife", 1) function DullKnife:PostUpdate() the rest of your code end DullKnife:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, DullKnife.PostUpdate) Also, player = 1 should be playerNum = 1 Game() :GetNumPlayers() shouldn't have the space, just Game():GetNumPlayers(). Game()GetPlayer(playerNum) should be Isaac.GetPlayer(playerNum) You don't need to put the AddCollectible stuff in a function, so you can get rid of testMod. And I think you probably want player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect() rather than AddCollectible, at the moment you are actually giving them the item. This would be fine if you were removing it at the end of the room, but right now they would keep it for the rest of the run. I *think* AddCollectibleEffects are reset when you leave the room</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately it's not well supported in the current API, at least I haven't found a good way. What I did in my transformer mod was something like this: function mod:Init() local syringes = {CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_VIRUS, CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SPEED_BALL, etc.} local counter = 0 end function mod:Update() if player:HasCollectible(modItem) then if counter  lt; 2 then for i = 1, #syringes do if player:HasCollectible(syringes[i]) then counter = counter + 1 table.remove(syringes, i) end end elseif counter == 2 then counter = counter + 1 player:AddCollectible(syringes[1], 0, false) player:RemoveCollectible(syringes[1]) end end end It's not particularly efficient but it was the best way I could figure out. If they gave us a pick up item callback we could at least only run this when we get a new item. Also, even though you remove the collectible some of them might have permanent effects. I've never tested it but I'd be very suprised if adding and removing Experimental Reshuffle would return you to your previous state, so make sure the first 3 syringes in your array are pretty innocuous, like The Virus, Speed Ball and Growth Hormones I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice, glad you got it going :) Now that you only give the item if you don't already have it, i think you should be able to just put your code all in one if statement: if player:GetPlayerType() == PlayerType.PLAYER_AZAZEL and player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BRIMSTONE) == false then Makes it neater and more efficient. What do you mean by the 2 costumes have the same animation names? They appear to me to be different in both costumes.xml and enums.lua. I don't know an awful lot about costumes but if you post the full code including where you clear and re-add the costumes I'll try and help</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice on buying Go equipment in Japan (Osaka/Kyoto)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-29 14:09:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I'm currently on holiday in Japan (Osaka for the next few days before moving on to Kyoto for a week) and was hoping to buy a goban while I'm here as I've always wanted one and thought it would make a great souvenir. Unfortunately I'm struggling to find any shops to buy go equipment - I've yet to come across any second-hand/antique shops with any go kit and there seems to be very little online to guide a foreign traveller to suitable shops. I'm open to any suggestions but would prefer to buy something with a bit of character rather than just any old goban like what I could already pick up online. I'm prepared for the fact the cost might be high and for the right board I'd be happy to pay what it's worth. Any ideas or suggestions would be really helpful!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow amazing, thank you so much for taking the time to look into this for me ^_^ I am talking about the big heavy ones with legs, so I'm prepared that I will probably have to pay a fair whack in shipping even if I buy it here (I definitely don't trust to let it get rattled around in my luggage, even if it was within my weight allowance!). Thank you so much for the offer of talking to people at your salon, that's really kind of you! Unfortunately I'm in Nara for the best part of the day tomorrow (and think lots of places are likely to be shut anyway as it's Sunday?) and then I'm off to Kyoto (via a couple of days in Koyasan) so I think I may have read this comment too late and missed the boat on getting something in Osaka :( it's really lovely of you to offer though, it can be hard to meet other people who are into this rather niche hobby so it's great to connect with other nice people who love the game ^_^</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Modern Christianity has fewer rules about sacred texts and images, while many other religions still enforce them strictly. Has this always been the case?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-15 11:01:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>In many religions there seem to be quite strict rules around their sacred texts (e.g. not touching Torah scrolls with bare hands in Judaism, making formal ablutions before touching the Qur'an in Islam, etc.) and images (e.g. not worshipping images of the Gurus in Sikhism, or forbidding images of Muhammad in Islam). In modern Christianity (here in the West at least) I'm not aware of any such rules. Has it always been this way? Or did Christians once have stricter rules about these kinds of things? And what factors led Christianity to take this more relaxed approach to their texts and iconography, where other religions don't?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course it comes down to what you feel comfortable with, but my advice would be to stick to your set amount per day. In the grand scheme of several months studying the book, what difference does an extra couple of days make? There's nothing wrong with giving yourself a day off here and there (although it's obviously worth keeping on top of reviews at least), and I think it's better to keep moving steadily forwards than trying to rush.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once heard speculation that the devs originally added them to help players in the tutorial missions (before you complete the Birth quest) have an idea of what to expect after they join the main game world. Especially when the game first launched, the servers weren't that populated so the gameplay was more PvE based, and the tech tree was much more limited, so it helped new players be prepared for which mobs to watch out for. Not sure how much practical purpose they really serve nowadays, but it's legacy code so probably not that easy for the devs to remove</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zero plumbing knowledge so hoping someone here can help/educate me! This pipe fitting (connected to my bathroom radiator) has a slow leak, water leaking from the grub screw-looking part in the middle. The screw turns but doesn't tighten, very little resistance when I turn it. Also when I apply pressure onto the screw it does go into the housing a small amount, then pop back out when I remove pressure (the one below is much more secure and does not do this) and the dripping seems to stop while it's pushed in. Massive thanks to anyone who has any ideas or advice on how I can solve this problem!</TEXT>
