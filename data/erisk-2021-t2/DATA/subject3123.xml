I understand you #8217;re on here to get away from your mom for a bit, but honestly you and your mom need to just talk. The two of you need someone to lean on in this moment. Give her some space to cry, but when you can, have a chat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s actually not true. While it seems like that friend this story and others similar to it, in the justice system it #8217;s a lot harder to convict someone of rape since most of the time it #8217;s a he-said she-said scenario. It #8217;s something like 1-6 American women are a victim of an attempted or completed rape/sexual assault in her lifetime, and about 433,648 people (12+) are raped on average in the US, but most of those cases aren #8217;t investigated because women don #8217;t tell anyone (in fear that people are gonna believe she #8217;s lying) or because the woman waited too long to have a rape-kit done, and therefore there really is no evidence. For every 1000 rapes, 384 are reported to the police, 57 result in an arrest, 11 are referred for prosecution, 7 result in a felony conviction, and 6 result in incarceration (thanks Wikipedia for those stats). Edited for statistics.</TEXT>

I agree with you to some extent, but honestly that statistic is already horrifying enough as is, extremist feminists don #8217;t really have to alter anything. Also the study was done using stats from 1998-2016, so (I could be wrong) I don #8217;t think that extremist feminism was really super  #8220;popular #8221; in that time period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AEDs are literally never used properly. They don #8217;t exist to restart the heart, they #8217;re there to bring the heart back to a normal rhythm. There has to be a heartbeat for them to work. And on that note, CPR. That #8217;s what #8217;s used to restart the heart, and I don #8217;t know the exact statistic, but it works less than 50% of the time. Based on the way Hollywood is doing it, though, it #8217;s gonna work 0% of the time.</TEXT>

My dad calls me a hypochondriac and a future pill popper whenever I bring up mental illness. The  #8220;not officially #8221; part is because I #8217;ve had therapists and psychiatrists tell me I have signs of ADD, they could be wrong, but it makes sense because my dad has it). I had to drop out of honors since I was failing because my teacher was strict about time. Fuck her.

    <TEXT>I have depression, anxiety, and signs (+symptoms, no diagnosis tho, since they surfaced after COVID started and my parents don #8217;t want me to be tested for either) of PTSD and ADD. It is SO hard to explain these things to people who aren #8217;t in my position, and I #8217;m currently dealing with the fact that people don #8217;t want to be around me anymore because I #8217;m  #8220;always negative #8221; (I #8217;m not, they just can #8217;t handle the fact that I #8217;m not bubbly and happy all the damn time, and sometimes I just need to be annoyed or sad). AAAAAHHHH sorry. Depression is not being sad for a period of time. Depression is (for me) this constant feeling of worthlessness, horrid mood swings, chronic insomnia, irritability, and poor eating habits (which caused me to develop an eating disorder for a period of time). Anxiety is not being awkward or asocial. Anxiety is (for me) the constant worry that I #8217;m not good enough, the constant worry that I #8217;m doing everything wrong, and I get genuinely panicked if I #8217;m in a room with a lot of people and a lot of noise. PTSD is not something that was gross or  #8220;scarring. #8221; PTSD is (for me) being self-destructive, being irritable, having severe trust issues, having panic attacks or  #8220;flashbacks #8221; whenever something triggers me, and chronic insomnia. ADD is not just getting distracted. ADD is (for me) being fidgety, impulsive, disorganized, with an extremely hard time focusing on things and taking a longer time for my brain to solve XYZ. This went on for much longer than I thought it would, but some people don #8217;t understand that having **one** symptom of a mental illness does not mean you have it. You have to be diagnosed, or at least fit into a certain number of symptoms before you can  #8220;self-diagnose #8221; and bring it up to a therapist or psychiatrist. Saying that you have  #8220;depression #8221; because you went through a bad breakup or you had to put a pet down is invalidating people who legitimately have it. These people unknowingly are causing this stigma with mental illnesses, and it #8217;s hurting those who are suffering from them. If you don #8217;t have it, just stop. I won #8217;t even say I have PTSD or ADD since I #8217;m not officially diagnosed even though I have, like, **most** of the symptoms of both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You guys, my friend told me this story from their old school, but a couple of guys were beating up a kid in a corner and kids were yelling at the bullies to stop. Naturally this got the attention of a teacher. The kid getting beat up had a massive black eye, a broken nose, and a broken wrist from trying to block kicks/punches. The teacher walks over to them and tells all three to go to the principal #8217;s. They got there, teacher told principal what happened, and bullies were suspended for a week, kid on the receiving end was suspended for two weeks, because the bullies said he instigated it. This kid had a black eye, and a broken nose and wrist and got a worse punishment than the kids who did this. Needless to say the parents pulled the kid out of the school and sued the teacher for child endangerment. This story really got me fucked up about the US education system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m a white female, and it makes me sick that I automatically get a leg up on the police because of my race. That #8217;s just so fucked up. But some cops are just generally aggressive no matter your race. My mother (who is also white) was driving and had to have the car check-in thing with our giant dog in the car (Newfoundland dog). Our dog started barking (he #8217;s a puppy and he gets antsy when he #8217;s in the car) and the he cop started yelling at my mom and reached for something that we assume could be used to beat our dog if it came down to it. It was just a check-in on our car and this cop got so aggressive. This is nowhere near equal to what POCs have to go through with cops. I #8217;m sure that some police officers are just trying to protect people, however they are apart of a corrupt organization that uses it #8217;s power to intimidate black people. Fuck the police officers that have ever killed or caused harm to a black man or woman just walking in the streets. Fuck the police officers that killed or watched the officer kill Floyd. Fuck the people that don #8217;t see an issue with it. We protest, and when that doesn #8217;t work, we riot. Edit: I asked my mom about it and she said that our dog was getting barky since the police officer was being aggressive. He yelled at her to control the dog, then questioned whether she even lived in the neighborhood she was driving to (we live in a gated community, our car has a barcode on the side to get though the gate  #129318; #8205; #9792; #65039;). He then threatened to have our dog put down. My mom told him that if he didn #8217;t do his job (registration was expired, that #8217;s why she was pulled over) then she would call someone who would. She was genuinely terrified and said that she doesn #8217;t trust cops at all anymore (unless of course someone is trying to kill you. If you are in danger please call the cops).</TEXT>

I agree with the  #8220;If protesting doesn #8217;t get anything done, we riot #8221; phrase (because that #8217;s how the Civil Rights Act was passed to begin with), but the people who are destroying and looting small businesses are not rioting, they #8217;re just looting.

    <TEXT>Same. While their music just isn #8217;t my thing (but my sister is a huge **real** fan), I can totally understand why they #8217;re so popular. They went years as a band with little to no recognition, so they make it very obvious how grateful they are to their fans. They had the option to opt out of being in the military, however they declined it since it #8217;s their duty as a Korean citizen to work in the military. I with I had that motivation, as you stated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I forget what it is since I #8217;m not a k-pop fan, but they have a word for it in the k-pop community, it #8217;s the equivalent of  #8220;stalker fan. #8221; They use it on the girls who harass the band, like hurling themselves at band members at the airport or in the streets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hitting a moose with my car is my biggest fear. You #8217;re only knocking it out by the legs, so it will fall on top of your car and crush you. If you #8217;re lucky, the moose will fall over the car and not kill you. If you survive being crushed by it, now you have to worry about a pissed off moose. Fucking terrifying. You think you can just drive away? Well, the front of your car is crushed, all the airbags went off, your windshield is most likely shattered, and the moose can 100% catch up to the car easily if you #8217;re following traffic laws. I #8217;d rather take my chances vex with the allegations in Florida or the rats in NYC than **ever** end up in this situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know why people give me weird looks when I tell them I do self-tanning (I use a lotion, spray tans look horrible on me, the stuff I use doesn #8217;t make me look orange, too). I like looking tan, but I don #8217;t want to increase my risk of skin cancer. I layer up on that SPF 60. Tanning is completely for vanity #8217;s sake, and it #8217;s stupid. If you want to go with that argument, tanning without sunscreen can increase aging and cause permanent sun damage (which ain #8217;t cute). Use sunscreen, and you #8217;ll thank me when you can avoid wrinkles until your forties or fifties.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got an annoying cat, my sister is super cuddly when we watch shows together, and my parents are very verbally abusive when they #8217;re drunk. My skin care routine in the morning is both cleansers, Azeliac acid all over my face (paying extra attention to places with a lot of redness), the blue moisturizer, sunscreen, then after that sits for a second, a powder in the T-zone. At night it #8217;s both cleansers at once, orange Vitamin C serum, Azeliac acid, blue moisturizer, then the one for redness relief. Put your retainer in every night, and when you wake up, put it in the containers in the medicine cabinet. I have chronic insomnia, so take melatonin and count sheep. I also am lactose intolerant, so take the lactose pill before having any dairy (even tho the pill is disgusting). My mental health issues include depression, anxiety, ADD, and PTSD. My depression makes me super irritable, sleep in for way longer than I should, and gives me a lack of motivation to do anything. Anxiety isn #8217;t super relevant at this time of year, but if my parents start becoming abusive I will have a mental breakdown and rethink my whole person. ADD should be pretty obvious, my mind wanders a lot so I have to really force myself to pay attention, but since we #8217;re not in school it shouldn #8217;t be that big of an issue. PTSD can be triggered from people raising their voices, people getting violent or physical at all, fat shaming (I had a pretty severe eating disorder two years ago), and generally getting into arguments with drunk people. Go for a 2 mile walk with my sister between 2pm and 6pm every day, shower afterwards, comb hair in shower, afterwards put the curly hair taming cream in. Once body is dry, apply self-tanning lotion thick and evenly to whole body including sides of feet and face. That #8217;s all I can think of for now. Just behave and everything will be alright. I won #8217;t tell you where things are because I don #8217;t know where things are lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He wasn #8217;t that much older than I was, but it was still illegal. I was 14, he was 19 (which isn #8217;t a huge age gap compared to some of the stuff on here). We met on a trip to France for the choir kids, and he was a choir teacher #8217;s son. He started flirting with me, and I was super desperate for validation and attention that I went for it. I basically spent an entire trip to France chasing after a guy instead of hanging out with my friends (who did **not** approve of this). Throughout the trip he was pretty handsy and was kinda pushy about things, even invited me to his room a couple times (which I turned down since my chaperone did nightly checkins). It took one date outside of France to realize how difficult it really was to maintain a conversation with him. He was just so untalkative and boring. After I told him whatever we had was over I completely ignored anything he sent to me and eventually it died down. I live in a gated neighborhood so I was never worried about him finding my address. About a month after everything was over I finally realized how creepy he was. I was not in a good space mentally for any kind of relationship and I didn #8217;t know what I was doing. He was old enough to know that it was not okay to go after a literal child. We never had sex, so I #8217;m not sure how valid this is, but I think this sorta answers the question.</TEXT>

I put a ton of work into it, had to write a paper, and by the time I had to present it at the science fair, I was well-spoken and informative. Even brought in some of my experiments and the tool I used to measure how much charge the batteries had left. Overall I spent about $100 of my own money (which is a lot for a 6th grader) on a tool to measure the charge, all the batteries, and stuff to create my poster boards. We had to present them to our individual science classes the next class, and I did. I #8217;m not an artist, and one of our requirements was a drawn something (I don #8217;t remember what) so I did my best. I got a B because the teacher thought it was boring and my drawing sucked.

The gym just burst into laughter, and the poor proctors were trying desperately to turn it off, but they had no idea how. The kid gave a chapel (think a speech with quotes about God) the next year to the school about something academic related, and for his introduction, the DEAN OF STUDENTS talked about how he taught his son and other students not to bring their phones to the exam room. His face turned more red than a tomato and the auditorium erupted into laughter (except the freshman cuz they didn #8217;t know what was going on). Poor kid.

    <TEXT>I'm single because I need to take a break from looking for attention and validation through guys/girls. It's draining for me and my mental health, and I end up stringing the person along. When I can figure out how to balance myself out, then I'll go for the guy I've been crushing on lol</TEXT>

You aren #8217;t special. #8221; Me:  #8220;My verbally abusive mother locked me in the car and drove me around for an hour and screamed at me the whole time while drunk. I was really scared since she almost veered off the road a couple times. #8221; Friend:  #8220;Welk my mom pushed me down the stairs this morning sober because I was walking too slow. You don #8217;t know what real abuse is until it gets physical. #8221; Both times someone around called this  #8220;friend #8221; out on their behavior, but they just shrugged it off. Some fake friends just can #8217;t let you have the spotlight. Their life is ***always*** better or worse than yours is. You can #8217;t do anything about this.

    <TEXT>I thought I didn #8217;t, but I actually kinda do. Sorta me, sorta my friend. So,  #8220;nice guy #8221; is J for this story. J really really liked this girl named A. He asked her to the winter formal dance and she accepted. I asked her about it since she never really seemed into him and she said that he was nice enough and she kinda felt bad since he said he #8217;d asked out a couple girls and they brutally rejected him (spoiler: that never happened, he was just trying to get pity points). They went to the dance together, but A decided she wanted to hang out with her friends at one point. This is when J got mad. He didn #8217;t yell at her, he told A that she was a  #8220;bitch for leaving him hanging #8221; and she was  #8220;lucky a guy like him would take interest in someone that looked like her, #8221; (fuck him for saying that, she #8217;s gorgeous inside and out). She wasn #8217;t sad or anything, just super shocked and a little mad. I didn #8217;t know this had happened, so at one point I dipped and went to get water when J walked up to me. He told me that A told him that he wasn #8217;t good enough for her since he wasn #8217;t attractive and wasn #8217;t muscular so she tossed him to the curb. I didn #8217;t know J super well, and I #8217;m an empathetic person, so naturally I tried to make him feel better. After that dance, he called me an hour later and told me he used to have a crush on me. Okay.... cool? We kept talking and at some point he tells me that he #8217;s not sure if he ever got over that crush.... I told him that I #8217;m happy being single and I hope this doesn #8217;t hurt our potential friendship. He said it wouldn #8217;t. At some point he tells me that his worst fear is being friend zoned (-_-), then proceeded to ask me, not on a date, but to be his girlfriend. I just told him that I was happy being single, I was going through too much in my life to be in a relationship and couldn #8217;t put another person through my life #8217;s drama (clearly I haven #8217;t quite figured out how to reject people). He told me he would  #8220;wait for me #8221; and I flat out told him that I don #8217;t want to get into a serious relationship in high school, so he needs to stop. He just said  #8220;God, why do I always fall in love with the fucked up bitches? #8221; and hung up. I just took a breath then went to bed bc I was too tired for this bs. Next day I see my friend H and told her I had a funny story. She said she did too. I told he about J acting like a  #8220;nice guy, #8221; and you guys, J called her right after he hung up on me and said he was going to OFF HIMSELF BECAUSE I REJECTED HIM. He kept my friend up for 4 hours (we hung up at midnight, I feel so bad for H) saying that he was gonna end himself because I #8217;m a selfish bitch, I broke his heart, etc. At this point I was just done with his drama, so we went to the guidance counselor and told her what was up. He didn #8217;t show up to school for a week, H and I blocked him in our phones, and that was the end of it. For a few months J tried to reach me on Snapchat, Instagram, email, and text, but I blocked him after every attempt and he gave up. Still hasn #8217;t given up trying to talk to me at school, but I #8217;ll give him one word answers then walk away. If you have a bad feeling about someone, trust ur gut and distance yourself or cut them out entirely.</TEXT>

I #8217;ll admit I come off as having a flirty personality, but that #8217;s me with everyone, no exceptions (like, I act this way with my sister, I #8217;m obviously not into my sister lol). I #8217;ve had so many guys think they #8217;re entitled to something because I was nice to them, then call me a slut/whore when I reject them. What is up with that?

    <TEXT>Give up on the friends that suck, work harder with the good ones. Quite. a few of my "friends" are the reasons that I have pretty severe anxiety. Try harder in school, and be more social. Also, there's nothing wrong with wanting to fit in. You don't have to be over-the-top weird to prove to your "friend" that you don't care what people think. Talk to my parents about my anxiety, because me bottling it up made things hard for them, which lead to my mom verbally abusing me. To add to that: listen to them about the friends that are bad for you. My parents predicted four years in advance that one of my friends was an asshole, and they were completely right. Ignoring them made them grow frustrated, and that turned to anger. **WASH YOUR FACE.** I had really bad acne starting at 10 and because I didn't wash my face in middle school, I had to go on Accutane and I'm getting a chemical peel done to fix the scarring. Brush your hair. I didn't brush my hair when I was twelve which lead to my mom taking me to get a bob. I have thick, poofy hair and the bob looked absolutely awful on me so I straightened my hair every day. That lead to a lot of heat damage on my hair, which four years later, I'm still trying to fix. Try harder in field hockey, because you're actually really good at it. If I worked a *little* harder I would've been on varsity my freshman year of high school (my JV coach even asked at one point during the season why I wasn't on varsity). That's about it. Middle school me sucked and if I could go back and redo it, I would do it in a heartbeat. I don't care about all the "lessons" I learned in that time, I also struggle with anxiety, depression, and PTSD because of the crap I did/caused in middle school.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same. I've told someone that if I could go back to the beginning of middle school, I would do it in a heartbeat and redo everything. I don't care about the "lessons" I learned from this, because those "lessons" resulted in my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. My current friend group is way overly dramatic, and some of my "friends" drained the life out of me. Screw lessons, screw learning, I want to go back and not be my stupid self.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My school had someone come in and talk about it. He made homophobic, racist, and sexist tweets when he was a senior in high school, and four or five years later, once he was working for a governor, the tweets were dug up and he was fired on his second day of working there. I didn #8217;t like the guy at all (just the way he presented him gave off trust-fund-baby and stuck-up-asshole vibes, not to mention all the self-pitying...), but his message was kinda important to high schoolers since we don #8217;t really think about what we post. It #8217;s stupid that something posted half a decade ago could be used as blackmail or a reason to fire someone, but it #8217;s important to teach teenagers to be mindful since this is how the internet works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surprised I haven #8217;t seen this, but stalking celebrities and taking photos of them at their worst for money. Paparazzi can be truly horrible sometimes. Celebrities are real people, too, and while the fame can get to their heads sometimes, they #8217;re people nonetheless. To add onto that,  #8220;loving #8221; or  #8220;hating #8221; and celebrity based on what we see on the internet. Once again, they #8217;re people. They aren #8217;t anyone to idolize, but they aren #8217;t people to hate either. We don #8217;t really know who they are on a personal level, so who are we to say that they #8217;re an angel or an asshole based on what the media presents?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve never had this happen to me before, but it #8217;s happened to my 22-year-old uncle (who btw looks like he #8217;s 16) wearing his police uniform. He was walking through a predominantly black area to get home (he walks home) and he was minding his own business. Some random guy walked up to him and got in his face about being a cocky white dude who knows nothing about being discriminated against, how he #8217;s supporting white supremacy, and how he #8217;s probably thought of killing a black man. It was kinda ironic because the guy was stereotyping and getting aggressive with my uncle based on his job and race. White people do not know what it #8217;s like to be discriminated against to the extent of black people, but it still happens. Be a supporter or equality, not supremacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not sure if this was a cultural thing, but it was annoying/weird to say the least. My cousin was getting married to a woman whose family was Hindu. They had a combo American-Hindu style wedding (which was actually pretty cool). At one point, the bride and groom took off their shoes, and someone hid the groom #8217;s shoes. The groom #8217;s family had to look for them because the wedding couldn #8217;t continue without them. We looked for 30-45 minutes and couldn #8217;t find the stupid shoes, so eventually the groom #8217;s dad just threw his shoes at him and told the officiant to get on with it.

    <TEXT>My great grandmother had Alzheimer #8217;s, and I was too young to fully comprehend it. I was really close with her when I was little, and I came to visit her sometimes. She started calling me by my mother #8217;s name (I look exactly the same as my mom did growing up), and then she started calling me by my grandmother #8217;s name. I would just laugh and say  #8220;I #8217;m not them, I #8217;m Gracie! #8221; Ten years later I understand it a little more, and it breaks my heart that my grandmother had to watch her own mother slowly forget about her. Alzheimer #8217;s is terrifying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After taking the PSAT, I went to a Foods of All Nations that was right across the street from my school. I was mentally drained and just wanted a quick snack. My friend owed me some money, so she said she was going to pay. My friend was going to use her debit card, but when we got to the register her card was declined. Turns out she spent all $1000 on that card on stupid stuff and her mom refused to put more money on it. I kinda gave up on the snacks since I didn #8217;t have any money on me, and on the verge of tears, I told the cashier that we #8217;d put everything back. She offered us her employee discount on everything, but we still didn #8217;t have enough. Just as we started to go put everything back, a random man walks up to us and asked how much we needed. At this point I just burst into tears because I was so tired, hungry, and happy. We got the the register and the cashier still offered us her discount again. We took it and gave the man his change. The cashier then gave the man a discount on *his* items for his kindness. After reading this out loud it sounds like a  #8220;And then everybody started clapping #8221; story lmao.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My parents said that if someone ever started a fight, I have every right to hit them back. My school was very zero tolerance with violence (so long as a teacher sees it happening), so a punishment at school is guaranteed. Well, that is until a family sued the school after their kid was punished for being beat up, but the bully got off scot-free. I think they won, but either way our school cared more about their reputation than the rule. They eased up on it the next year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Avoiding work and being lazy for too long leads to years of playing catch-up. In middle school I put in little to no effort in my classes. I was a solid B student and I did the same my freshman year of high school. Sophomore year was when I realized how stupid I was being and I spent the entire year working my ass off to get into good classes next year. I have to do even more work in and outside of school to get into AP Spanish my senior year. Its not necessarily  #8220;too late #8221; for me since universities look more at improvement than overall GPA, but if I put in any effort whatsoever in 8th grade, I #8217;d be in all AP and honors classes next year. I fell behind, not because I didn #8217;t understand the material, but because I was too lazy to put in extra effort.</TEXT>

Their marriage was fucked up and they were always arguing (they still do this). I had a really fucked up connotation with love, basically. I became so obsessed with the idea of finding a knight in shining armor to come and save me, so I started dating when I was twelve. That didn #8217;t work out (I #8217;m currently besties with the guy lol), so I moved on to another guy. Then, when I realized I was bi, I started dating guys AND girls.

    <TEXT>Ugh that is so frustrating and horrible. I #8217;m sorry you went through that. My depression went undiagnosed for a few years. My physician always told me she suspected anxiety and depression, but my parents refused to let me do counseling. So many of my friends didn #8217;t take me seriously because I was undiagnosed, and it took a suicide attempt for anybody to realize something was wrong with me. While depression shouldn #8217;t be in every conversation, people need to talk about it sometimes and receive support from their peers. People who fake depression for attention can go die in a ditch (not actually, but they need to fuck off). They might not think they #8217;re doing damage, but they #8217;re taking attention away from people who need the help and support, and generally they don #8217;t know a lot about depression, so they just make the stereotypes regarding depression worse than they already are.

When she #8217;s done with high school she #8217;s going to get her tubes tied so she doesn #8217;t have to worry about getting pregnant. When she accidentally mentioned that to our grandmother she was just so disappointed and angry. Like, gma, you have four other grandkids who want to have children. Also, ITS NOT YOUR DECISION. Now, if anybody questions her decision, she responds with  #8220;I don #8217;t want kids. I haven #8217;t for my entire life. I can #8217;t handle the pressure and responsibility of having a child, nor do I want to change diapers or put my body through the trauma of childbirth. If one day I do decide I want kids, I #8217;ll foster or adopt older kids. #8221; That #8217;s always been a very satisfying answer for most people, and the few people who still get angry have little to no influence on our lives anyway.</TEXT>

She basically resented me and my siblings until we I turned 15 (I #8217;m 16 now #8221;).

I just made the most irritated look I could from behind my mask, whipped out my inhaler, and said (paraphrasing)  #8220;Dude, I have severe asthma and I can still wear a mask with almost no problems breathing in it. You #8217;re being selfish and putting other people #8217;s lives on the line by not wearing a mask. If you have asthma, you should be *more* inclined to wear a mask since the virus affects your lungs, which is more likely kill people with asthma than those without. Please shut up and just get a mask. #8221; The dude still tried to argue with me, but I left because I wasn #8217;t gonna deal with their stupidity. People who use asthma as a free pass go not wear a mask disgust me as someone who has really really bad asthma. I don #8217;t feel like dying because of selfish people.</TEXT>

I #8217;m so glad that she didn #8217;t have to be hospitalized, but what if she did? What if she died because some jackass decided not to wear a mask? This is why we need to wear them.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in the same situation. I #8217;m 16 as of recently, and reading this made me realize that I can just leave. My parents completely over-exaggerated how expensive and horrific emancipation really is as a deterrent. They also downplayed what they were putting me through.

    <TEXT>My cat did the same. When he was a kitten we #8217;d put him and his brother in a crate with their food, water, and litter box to prevent them from getting in a lot of trouble when we weren #8217;t watching them. Wish I thought to take a picture (I was 10 at the time, so forgivable), but every time we walked into their room in the morning, we #8217;d find my cat upside down on the top bars of the crate. He #8217;s cooled down on the psycho since then haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Frrrr. Like, do you even know what you #8217;re raging against? Tom Morello had the best comeback to Paul Ryan saying that Rage was his favorite band.  gt; #8221;Don #8217;t mistake me, I clearly see that Ryan has a whole lotta  #8220;rage #8221; in him: a rage against women, a rage against immigrants, a rage against workers, a rage against the gays, a rage against the poor, a rage against the environment. Basically the only thing he #8217;s *not* raging against is the privileged elite he #8217;s groveling in front of for campaign contributions. #8221; Another response I liked:  gt; #8221;I wonder what Ryan #8217;s favorite song is? Is it the one where we condemn the genocide of Native Americans? The one lambasting American imperialism? Our cover to  #8220;Fuck the Police #8221;? Or is it the one where we call on the people to seize the means of production? So many excellent choices to jam out to at Young Republican meetings! #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom is a  #8220;not like other girls #8221; girl who never grew out of that phase. When I was little, my younger sister was always praised for being a  #8220;cool #8221; and  #8220;badass #8221; girl. She hate skirts and dresses from a young age, and she even punched a boy in the face when he messed with her. So cool -_- This went on for basically my entire childhood. This really fucked with me, because I wanted to be praised like that. When I was 13, I started to go through this phase, but whenever I did anything like my sister, I was  #8220;basic #8221; and  #8220;unoriginal #8221; and I just  #8220;look so dumb. #8221; Que anxiety reaching its full potential. I got over my phase when I realized that I was losing friends because of it, but some of what happened really sticks with me (I #8217;m 16 now). My sister still gets praised for her curvy body, her perfect grades, and her  #8220;badass #8221; attitude, but I #8217;m fine with that. I love my sister, and I #8217;m great in my own way. I work out a lot (purely because I enjoy it), Im going into all honors and AP classes next year, and I #8217;m an empathetic and kind person. Wouldn #8217;t want it any other way :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I watched my three-year-old sister get run over by a car when I was four. I don #8217;t remember much, but I remember a lot of screaming and the most emotionless look in my mom #8217;s face as she pulled my sister out from under the car. Also watching my sister get her cast off from the broken leg she got in the accident. So much screaming. These are literally the first memories I have. My sister is alive and actually perfectly fine aside from a scar on her cheek. My mom on the other hand still has some internalized trauma from that twelve years later, and she #8217;s only recently started to get over the alcoholism this accident drove her into.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. This kind of cancer coming early runs in my family (like two weeks ago my dad had to get a colonoscopy and they found precancerous polyps, a few years ago my aunt had it in her mid 30s, and my grandfather had it when he was in his early 30s). And when my grandfather and aunt asked about it, they were sent away because they were so young. Only reason they #8217;re taking it more seriously with my dad is because two of his immediate family got it. Some doctors need to take colorectal cancer seriously in the younger patients. These people have so much life ahead of them and it #8217;s not fair that they might lose that because of an incompetent or stubborn doctor.</TEXT>

I disagree with the way factory farms operate, and I hope that some day they are dismantled so that hard-working and animal-friendly farms can become more popular, but I don #8217;t think hay eating meat is morally wrong.

    <TEXT>I love learning Hangul, but reading it is definitely the most difficult for me in the beginning. I #8217;m usually really really good at picking up languages. Spanish, Latin, and ASL were no problem for me, but Korean was really hard. I was super irritated in the beginning, but then I got super happy that a language finally challenged me. Now that I #8217;ve found a language to challenge me, I won #8217;t stop until I #8217;ve tackled it.</TEXT>

My dad would always give the  #8220;there are kids in Africa starving right now, and you can #8217;t just finish your meal. #8221; Then my mom would constantly talk negatively about overweight people.

The CS teacher essentially called my uncle a stupid child and let him be.

    <TEXT>I tried to kill myself when I was 14, but the thing that stopped me was my cat. I was the only person who loved my cat because he was mean and annoying to everyone else. I don #8217;t even know how he got into my bathroom that night, but he #8217;s the reason I #8217;m still here and I #8217;ll love him forever for that. After that, it was just living day after day to make sure he was properly loved.</TEXT>

It #8217;ll hurt for you and we #8217;re gonna have to clean up a lot of blood. #8221; Apparently she #8217;s actually had someone do that before and they were not prepared for the outcome.

They take what the community is asking of them and delivering it in a completely different way than expected, and that #8217;s honestly what makes a great game. Giving the people what they didn #8217;t know they wanted. I just have to stop and appreciate them every once in a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sounds like what my brother is going through. My parents are so quick to belittle him and slap him if he does something wrong, and he #8217;s only 13. Growing up with this fucked up his brain, so now it can #8217;t properly process anger and sadness. He #8217;s literally numb to it because his brain doesn #8217;t know what to do. I fucking hate my parents for doing that to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doctors thought I was faking. Came in with a difficulty breathing and pain with every breath. I have asthma, so I figured it was something relating to that. Doctors told me I probably just strained something and that was causing the pain, but the pain came back every time I had one specific drink at my work. Turns out I #8217;m allergic to something in the drink and it was an allergic reaction I was having. This isn #8217;t nearly as bad as some of the ones on here, but it really sucks to go to a professional about a horrible pain and they literally don #8217;t believe you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Not to mention it #8217;s something you *literally* cannot self diagnose. This is what gets me. A lot of people don #8217;t understand the roots of DID. It comes from *severe,* *repeated* trauma as a young child still developing a personality. The brain creates these multiple personalities as a way to protect the  #8220;host #8221; from the trauma. It #8217;s essentially saying  #8220;This child **will not** survive this if they know what #8217;s going on. #8221; This is how the alters form. If someone has actual DID, they should *not* share memories with their alters. They should *not* know they have DID. If they did it could be extremely detrimental to the wellbeing of the  #8220;host. #8221;</TEXT>

It didn #8217;t help that when I was in middle school I had super toxic friends who would spread rumors about me and talk about me behind my back.

    <TEXT> gt;It #8217;s pathetic that the richest country in the world doesn #8217;t use a fraction of that wealth to take care of the people who live there. I live in America and I agree. I took a sports med class and we visited an emergency mode so facility. They told us a lot of Americans don #8217;t go to the doctors or call 911 for medical issues until the last minute or it #8217;s too late. The wage gap between the richest people and the poorest is absolutely pathetic. We have billionaires voting people into government positions who will make them more money, while there are hundreds of thousands of people who work 3 jobs and can #8217;t afford a house. This is the problem with trickle-down economics. The general idea (to my knowledge) is that the rich people get everything and their leftovers go to the poorer citizens. This doesn #8217;t work, however, when the rich people are keeping the leftovers as well. Sorry for the long rant, it just pisses me off to see rich kids at my high school talk about how they *only* got a Toyota for their 16th birthday while there are people who can #8217;t even think about a car because they #8217;re worried about their next meal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not bad with personal hygiene because it gives me really bad anxiety to be dirty, but I struggle really bad with cleaning my room. I just have absolutely no motivation/determination to do it, so I let it get as bad as it can before my parents scream at me to clean it. It #8217;s a sign that depression is getting bad, so while I can #8217;t get a therapist, I strongly suggest you do if you can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My parents are going through a divorce without the divorce part. They #8217;re always screaming at each other for the dumbest things, and if they can #8217;t scream at the other then they take it out on me and try to blame me for the situation. I #8217;ve had to call the cops on them twice after they got violent with each other, or attempted to with my siblings, but the cops said they  #8220;couldn #8217;t do anything. #8221; I kept this and so much more to myself because I don #8217;t want to be a burden to other people. My parents convinced me that they would hate me if I told them anything that happened. I let them manipulate me into shutting my mouth for years, but it #8217;s affecting my life now. My friends are noticing the bags and puffiness under my eyes from crying and lack of sleep, they notice I #8217;m quiet and tired all the time. My teachers catch me falling asleep during class and are wondering why I #8217;m missing so many reading assignments, because it #8217;s really hard to do readings when people are screaming at each other. I want to tell them everything, but the last time I let everything off my chest I was told I was being over dramatic and depressing by my (now ex) best friend, so now I #8217;m scared to tell anyone. While I #8217;d love some advice, I don #8217;t expect any. I just needed to rant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Freshman year of high school I had a crush on one of our foreign students from China. I realized two years later that he had a crush on me. For a little context: my school is half boarding school half day school. We get a lot of boarder students from different Asian and African countries. I am a day student, so I lived nearby the school. He came late in the year because he had issues with his student visa, so his first day he didn #8217;t have anything set up. I had a bunch of classes with him, so I volunteered to help him out. I was an awkward, acne-faced 14-year-old who had absolutely no confidence at all, but holy shit I was an idiot. Every time I was with him getting work done, he would always look at me with just a sparkle in his eye. He would also call me sweet and thank me a lot for helping him. The thing that really gets me is the fact that he literally called me cute on multiple occasions and asked what my plans were for weekends since he was bored at the dorms. I feel like such an idiot now that I #8217;m typing this out. Edit cuz I forgot a slightly important piece of information: this kid would always ask me for help with his classes (even though some of them were more advanced than mine), and the one day I was out sick, apparently he was really worried about me. I promise none of this is creepy, he and I were 14 at the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It definitely depends on the person. Everybody is in a situation, and some people really would need/want that money.

It #8217;s not necessarily vilifying anyone, it just kinda adds to the wholesomeness of this particular story.

If she wanted her daughter to learn a lesson she should #8217;ve made her volunteer to help with cancer patients to learn some empathy. Shaving her head is just gonna make her more resentful and hateful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All the 12-year-olds thinking they have depression after listening to her music. It #8217;s just so toxic. As someone who actually has depression, it kinda sucks seeing these girls walk around in all black talk about how terrible life is, how  #8220;damaged #8221; they are, and how much they want to die. Like, you #8217;re twelve. I #8217;m not gonna tell you that you can #8217;t feel this way, but you #8217;re so young and have so much world to explore and learn about. Idk, prob just me. Edit to clarify: I #8217;m in no way blaming her as an artist, she #8217;s just the MCR of this generation. Not the artist #8217;s fault their fans are like this, their fans just go through this phase and use their music as a way to try to validate whatever #8217;s happening with them.

Homosexuality is literally a chemical in your brain that finds the same gender sexually appealing, whereas thievery is a choice made by someone that negatively impacts other people. Drug addiction is a tough one since some addictions are inflicted on a fetus during pregnancy, but a lot of drug addictions are also a just decision (please correct me someone if I #8217;m wrong, though, obviously the addiction part was not a choice, taking the drug is).</TEXT>

He also had some old white woman call him the n-word with the hard r. 2. I was speaking Spanish to one of our customers (because I know Spanish and they didn #8217;t know English) and another customer told him to go back to Mexico. He was from Guatemala... 3. I was speaking Spanish with a friend at a mall for a Spanish project and a white couple lost it at us and told us that  #8220;This is America, we speak English here. Go back to Mexico #8221; (because racist ppl in my area are *so* creative). We #8217;re both white, so we were confused as hell. Just told me to fuck off in English. 4.
