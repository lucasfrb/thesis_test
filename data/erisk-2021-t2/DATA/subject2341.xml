    <TEXT>I found Metal Resistance a great album much bettert than the first, but I failed to find songs that I like more than Akatsuki, Megitsune or IDZ. Maybe, when we have a good quality video of the new songs in concert I will find new favorites. I like the live sound of Babymetal and I listen almost only live versions (CD or videos) of the first album.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm disapointed. Your example shows good or even great animation, but the art is only functional, there is no art or beauty there. It should be a japanese studio animation and I would be more at ease. (And the passion that a japanese crew would put in the project). Look that, the way the [images and sceneries paint feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cSspfRXWoc) is sorely missing in western animation. Edit: look what a good studio can do with [music AND action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXb1LQavaS8):</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a Fuki Fan since Doll$boxx, but was very dissapointed with her last project Fuki Commune (and the hiatus of Light Bringer) generic J-Pop/soft J-Rock and overproduced, but this[ trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amL9cCg-LS4) made me want to follow the project again, because the live sound has more life thanks to bass and guitar play (Kami Isao on guitar), and them I stumbled with this [new Unlucky Morpheus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8i_QhOgsKw), and I really like it. Long story short Fuki Commune Live DVD and Black Pentagram Unlucky Morpheus single bought and on my way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #180;m not talking of Babymetal songs, I'm talking about the concept of the shows, and comparing with other bands failure works. I'm still reserving my judgement about the new songs until pro recordings of them. Nobody is saying the show is bad, we are saying is not the best show they can do and there is fear this setup will be the future Babymetal. Less emphasis in the music and less metal and transform the thing in a Musical. There is an interview to the Amuse President where he talked about his love for musicals and how Legend S was an example of the kind of show he wanted to develop. The songs sound catchy as hell but unispired clearly searching to broaden the fan base of Babymetal even at the cost of alienate the core fanbase. Then I can see the executives congratuling themselves talking about how thanks to their ideas and vision they increased the number of fans, ignorinng the fact that Babymetal was in their way (in their own style) to be one of the biggest bands in the world. They could be U2 but now will be just 30 seconds to mars.</TEXT>

If they would be clear upfront Yui is not able to perform and we'll jmade changes to the set up, people would be supportive, but you can't avoid to think this is the new Babymetal, member changing depending of the lore is cheat at the fan base, so people is annoyed and angry and this will be growing if they are not clear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. The chosen seven is a comic book thing, they dont needed to tie it with the number of performers on stage. The dark side is in the works from a long time and it not relation with Yui, and the chosen seven is in the works from at least last year because is in the comic, the video of Distortion show the seven characters and it was started to being produced several months ago. If they want to cover Yui's absence, there is no need to tie in with the concept. Nevertheless, the management have the obligation with the fans to tell them who will be touring, is a thing of respect. Like now it see4ms they don't care for people going to concerts nor the girls themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still think Amuse tried to keep Yui in the band but it was imposible /sad/. Thinking in the future, they need to replace her, didnt like the formation of last tour. Only as a provisory measure waiting for Yui's return was acceptable (and it would be a lot better if they just said it BEFORE the tour). Now sadly Yui is gone, so she need a replacement or go on only with Suzuka, A duo of Suzuka and Moa just not work cause the difference between them. Another option is just one support dancer to mantein the choreography and dinamics in the stage, but it would be akward. So a replacement is the better option. And I wish Yui the best and hopefully she can recover of whatever is affecting her. But I'm scared because Starlight video shows the Seven cloaked figures with 2 on front (and even shows the eyes of those two), but in all the other imaginery of the Chosen Seven there were threee up front.</TEXT>

Maybe five back up dancers to rotate for different song choreos? I dont like that idea. The awful costumes of this year need to go. At least now we have some closure and can start to move forward.

    <TEXT>No, my point is the change that we saw this yeart was worse than the last year. You made changes to improve or enhance something, not for the sake of it. There is no reason to change to a new model less than the earlier model just for change things. For example of the five new songs that we know till now, only Starlight compares favorably with the earlier works, and no one of this new songs have a guitar solo, just the same breakdown formula. Why having some of the best guitarrist in Japan and not showcase their talent? Im not agains change, it is needed as the time goes by, but the changes seen this year have been less good than they could.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Past choreographys need simetry and a partner for Moa. The Muscle Metals formation didnt work cause the interaction and sinergy between Moa and Yui is lost, and puting Moa an Su in the same center line is confusing and remove one of them of the interactions. For older songs they need at least a dancer who play the Yui part, ideally a new member. For new songs I would be open to Choreos with Su and Moa side by side, but the work that they have to do is soooo different that it woul be unbalanced, and it probably need a couple of dancers anyway to restore some of the simetry (BUT NEVER FIVE). So the more simple aproach is ONE new partner for Moa. Only if the girls themselves dont want a new member (cause they love Yui), use one dancer to fill the Yui parts and make new songs for two people.</TEXT>

I love Sakura Gakuin, but I don #180;t think Babymetal should become in some kind of Sakura Gakuin introducing new characters, or having a nameless 5 people extra on the stage. Just find ONE to replace Yui to bring balance to the force. They can bring extra dancers to a couple of songs in big stages (like they have done in the past with Sister Bones) but made them part of the lore and mess with the formula is several steps backwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your very video shows five people, sooo at least there is no need for 2 of the seven. I'm pretty sure they will go through the chosen seven concept till whatever they have planed, regardless if it is as succesful as they thoght it would or a failure.  gt; if we have come to that conclusion based upon the concept without knowing its execution, our conclusion stands a good chance of being wrong. The only thing that has kept Babymetal afloat this year, and even winning some new fans, is the past catalog and the performances of Su, Moa and the Kamis. You will have many difficulties to find many people who prefer these shows over for example FFF last year. Babymetal is still relevant despite the chosen seven, definitely not thanks to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Outfits and hair should be minor quibles of the changes introduced, but receive a lot of hate (myself included) cause they were introduced with a big change in the stage performance. And this is why people felt betrayed, putting unnecesary people on the stage cheapens everything was right before (three girls and their dynamics and Kami band presence). I want to be calm with the future, but when te official sources say "Su-Metal and Moametal will be the core of the rebirth of Babymetal..." I dread that word "CORE". I'm scared to find the band will be a revolving place for different number of dancers and god knows what else. Ther detailed pictures of of this Japan tour confirm to me my views that even on that big stages, they add too little to the show that the result is less than if they would not be there. Nobody is saying "the show is better now with this setting I want to see it again and again", the nicest thing that people say about it "it was a great show I want to see what they would do next" but nobody really is stocked to see the chosen seven again. Pretty sure the overwhelming majority prefer the three formation or even a 4 if they want to keep Moa and Sure separated.</TEXT>

Just for fun, in Budokan Ohmura used 3 ESP guitars, Pink-chan a seven strings Snapper, a golgen seven strings M-7 and a Silver six strings Snapper. Leda used 4 different ESP six strings guitars, a Black sparkle SG type, a black see thru don't know the model (the one he used to employ in all the tours with Babymetal) with 2 EMG humbuckers, a standard 6 strings Black Arrow (the special Babymetal model is a 7 strings) and a blue guitar with a humbucker and a single pick ups don't know the model (maybe a Mirage?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every time a production is modified to incorporate elements that link it with a new multimedia franchise, the original production suffers. There are no excuses for not being the best that can be with the available elements. And this is a clear case of less is more. Even Koba in previous interviews has indicated that he always preferred to use the most basic elements (colors, lighting, etc.) and simple and that this gave more strength to the proposal. I can not understand how someone who went from three girls with a backing track, to incorporate a wall of Marshalls, then Babybones to give more atmosphere of rock concert, came to think that turning the stage into a show in Las Vegas was a good idea. Everything for which Babymetal fought, how to get a real band with outstanding musicians now does not seem relevant in the new proposal. Even visually, now there is less movement and energy on the stage that it was wit only Yui and Moa. Everyone, Katy Perry, Bieber, etc. can have a bunch of dancers moving in synchro (and that does not necessarily make it into a good show), but there was only one Babymetal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Personally, I don't mind the changes, the hairstyles, the dancers, the outfits. It's just art, it's a show. Su and Moa could wear literal bin bags and they would still look epic. Costumes and hair style are minor quibbles, the real elefant in the room is the change in the visual presentation. There is no way to understand the presence of five backing dancers and made it look they are part of the band. All this chosen seven thing is a misguided direction, they even said in the official statement that Su and Moa are the CORE of new Babymetal, they are not Babymetal.</TEXT>

With the seven it doesn #180;t matter who is Moa is just a bunch of dancers moving in sync, it not make a better show and Moa is just one of the six backing dancers and even Su can not be distinguish cause the overcrowded stage.

    <TEXT>Yes, you are missing the point. I will try to explain to you, but it seems you are too angry to accept others opinions. When you have the original three working in a small space it does not look like three separate people, they work as a unit that as a whole that attracts your attention, while the rest of the stage is an impressive band of rockers playing impressive and technical music. When you look at the Chosen Seven, it's no longer a unit, it's Su with 6 support dancers, you can look at Su or the dancers, while it's hard for the Kami Band to get your attention unless you specifically want to look at any of them (which kills the image of a rock show). It does not loger look as a rock or metal show, it looks like a Las Vegas kind of show.</TEXT>

The stage dinamics are very similar to when Yui was there, and we can expect that in the next shows their quemistry will improve. And second, she needs to sing. No need to have a great voice, but she needs to sing competently to partner with Moa. Moa has rise to the challenge, but there are parts when Moa needs the chorus effect of two voices (Karate, Gimme Choco, ROR, etc.).</TEXT>

Neverless interrupting someone giving an speech (whatever if they know or not english) is disrespectfull and bad behaviur, I dont think he would interrupt Metallica for example (unless he were a friend of them). Resuming, he was an ass and deserves a lot of the backlash he got.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are not understanding the point that Kmudametal and I are making. The guy was an idiot, interrupting the speech either with Babymetal or another group. On the other hand, he never recognizes his bad behavior, but continues to blame others because "nobody warned him not to bother Babymetal because they are special." NO ONE had anything to tell him, since he should never have been so ill-mannered as to interrupt the winners. Being an idiot with everyone does not excuse him from being an idiot with Babymetal, so I think that everything he received on social networks is deserved. And if you listen to the podcast and the way of speaking that it has, it does not surprise me that it behaves like this, zero manners, zero self-criticism and zero respect for others through its language. But for him, the fault lies with others, that's how bad kind of person he is.</TEXT>

When they had to drop the original singer, they taked the bad decision of not replace her, adding a keybordist that sings sometimes and a couple of dancers that musically apport little. Made Hana Guitarrist and singer would had been a good decision six years ago. At least they are doing it now, but the sub units, etc. are worrying.

    <TEXT>Before 2015, LEda and Ohmura did the their parts and Mikio was the sustitute and did the parts of whoever was missing. Then normally Mikio would do the Leda parts, except when Leda was filling for Ohmura. Last year, Isao did the Ohmura parts and Ohmura the Leda parts when it was with Isao and the Ohmura parts when was with Leda. Leda always did his parts. And for the Australia and Singapur dates I didnt pay much attention, but I suppose Isao did Ohmura parts and Hiraga the LEda parts. The position not alway tell the whole story, cause nnormally Mikio was on the left side but his parts depend on if he was with Ohmura or Leda.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In this manufactured thing, I think there is many differences. For example, in Babymetal performers and composers are being paid to do a job, but at the same time they are doing something that they like and putting all their talent to do "their job" and on the other side you can have the same but for example the composer (maybe a metal head) being asked to write a three note country song, and the difference is evident in the quality output. In Babymetal you have people who are doing their work, but is a work they enjoy actively. Robert Trujillo is just a hired bassist in Metallica or Richie Faulkner in Judas Priest, but would you said is manufactured?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me the main thing is the music. Just being the Kami band with Suzuka on stage is enough... or should be. If I learn anything of the past year is that annoys me when something so good conform to a lesser standar of quality just because they dont want to face some kind of problems. For me acceptable standars are; 1. Of course Yui back, but sadly it will not happen 2. Replace Yui with another girl. Take her duties singing and dancing. 3. Use a no named girl or rotative girl to fill in the thir spot (singing and dancing), and maybe include in the new album a couple of songs (not more than that) only for Su and Moa. 4. Same as before but she dont sing like Saya last year. For me is important that a new girl fixed or rotative, sing because Babymetal need the choruses and backing vocals os Moi Moi, Moa alone is not enough (and is not lack of quality), they need the harmonization of backing vocals.</TEXT>

I dont hate it and I can see me enjoying in a live or fest stting, but as music goes meh. They went all the way with the WTF factor. I dont mind the song too much probably it will not be in my favorites, what Im worried now is the new album. We know six songs by now and thwere is not one to the quality of ROR or Karate (or The One or Syncopation) and foour of them are fillers at the most (Papaya, Tatoo, Elevator Girl, ITNO) not better than Awadama or Yava, and leading songs Starlight and Distortion are way below ROR or Karate. And for the first time Im happy with the song being short (Distortion would have been improved a lot with anothe verse and/or a solo that give to it some kind of purpose)</TEXT>

Mikios have a thicker neck and more important is set with a high action on the strings so is a lot difficult to play for someone like Ohmura who set his guitars with low action and other details to make the guitar a lot easy to play fast, but hard to get the type of Mikio's guitar sing (wich needs a really good technic to achieve). And finally Ohmura never use in his guitars the tremolo (it seems he sets the bridge fixed) and Mikio's guitar on top use a Floyd rose bridge. Ohmura said maybe in a twiter, that the most difficult for him was the Floyd Rose and now he was learning a lot to play Mikio's guitar. For example, floating bridges are difficult to tune and every time Ohmura bend the strings the tension on the other strings change so he said it was neded to move a little in the other direction to compensate. You can see that Ohmura have a great ear (you can notice in his solos how often change the pick up selector when most will chose just one position or how often he re-tune his guitar after every song).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My take on this is an scheduling problem of several Kamis but not on every one of them, not all the time. Then to bring new japanese Kamis needs additional dates in Japan to rehearse together,... and more problems of conflicting schedules of the band. From a quality point of view its necessary that the band rehearse together to they can play tight. So the solution of that was use a local band who can use all the time necessary to develop a tight fit between them BEFORE the start of the tour. We all want Ohmura, Boh, Hideki and Leda but that is something that never was assured in a Babymetal show, and I appreciate how Koba went out of their way to ensure the best possible band to support BM. As a final example, Babybetal was invited to play in the Golden Gods Awards in 2015, but scheduling conflics prevented the Kami Band to support it, so the solution then was to play with Dragonforce as support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think in my opinion, Babymetal wanted to release a double album with a Light Disc and a Dark disc, but they were advised by their western partners (or themselves decided to scrap the concept after the backlash of 2018) to release a single disc to the international public, but at 59min total it was too long, so they decided to cut one song from each disc, to leave one disc of 53 min (still long but not so much). I think in the japanese ver. it flows better cause you can have the phisical separation of the light and dark themes. In the international edition it could be complemented with the artwork of the booklet to understand better the concept.</TEXT>

The second CD is not less heavy than Metal Resistance, but I can see why they decided against a double album in the rest of the world, but with the songs being so variaded some people find difficult to hear the album from start to finish. I find Metal Galaxy as album the best of the three. I would say dont grieve so much and stream the songs that you like as many times as is possible there are some gems in the album.</TEXT>

On tje other side, I liked Metal Resistance more than the first, but it lacked songs like Megitsune, Akatsuki or IDZ :) Following that pattern I will wait to have full live recordings and I will enjoy Megitsune,.....,Karate, etc. together Arkadia, Shine, Distortion, etc. And will be exited about rotations on the setlist of live recordings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I always liked japanese pop and rock like X-Japan, L'Arc en Ciel, Lareine, Hizaki and popier sound like Kalafina or Nanase Aikawa and always wondered how would sound a J-pop singer with a heavy metal band (my idea probably would have sound something like Ironbunny). Some day drinking and watching videos with friends, I mentioned this idea and my friend ask me if I knew Babymetal and then played the Gimme Choco video, but it really not take my attention (normally I become fan of bands after hear them live) it seemed to me they were just a subunit of a major Idol agrupation (with the big arena setting of the video it didnt occur to me that they could be popular to be a solo show in that big venue) with interchanging members and a short shelf live. Then in november 2014 Youtube recomendations showed me a Sonisphere pro shot of Gimme Choco and IDZ, wait they were in Sonisphere? UK? A metal fest? I needed to watch that and I hoped the crowd were polite enough for them, but the reality was shocking: A Live band... they are awesome... corpse paint... genious for a probably rotating musicians, ... they are good ... they sound good and for IDZ I was sold, when the music low the volume in IDZ bridge and you can hear the crowd woooa in awe with Susuka's voice I was in the same page, so then I binge watched everithing I could, then the first fancams of ROR ( then known as The one) surfaced so I preordered the Budokan BD and as everyone, the rest is history.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think they knew things very early. In the interviews of 2019 (almost type this year lol) the girls and Koba have said that Su and Moa wanted to continue with Babymetal, and with the reported presence of the girls parents in the (short) european tour of 2018, I believe there was a strong possiblity of they were thinking in end Babymetal then, probably just fulfill the dates already booked, and that. The parents presence (the four of them) in that moment is a strong indicator of them having doubts about the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From Legend D show: It was the winter just 15 years ago when, in the idol scene, the teen group known as "the SPEED king of Okinawa" had a dominant influence. On December 20th of that year, SU-METAL was born to this world. Concurrently, on December 31st 15 years ago, the legendary band called "invincible" ended its history at the Tokyo Dome. The Fox God said, "It is the birth of the new life that transcends the law of nature,and as its cost an old life shall pass away." Preparing for the upcoming "Metal Resistance", SU-METAL has made many efforts in the "idol" scene. She went to a local dance school since her childhood. She sang "Daring!" while she was absolute cute. She went to the growth-stage-limited school. SU-METAL's undercover propagation in the "idol" scene was executed steadily. Now "the special night of fifteen" starts to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of SU-METAL's birth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My understanding is Takayoshi and Leda as the first stable duo had fixed parts, and Mikio as replacement learn both parts as needed (mainly he replaced Takayoshi in this period). Later Leda left to focus on his new group and Mikio and Takayoshi were the main with Mikio playing old Leda parts. When Isao was called to replace Takayoshi in Yokohama 2015 he played Takayoshi parts. Then Leda returned and is my understanding that when Leda played he did his old parts and Mikio changed to Takayoshi parts. When Mikio died, Leda and Takayoshi returned to their old parts but when Isao played he did Takayoshi's parts and Takayoshi (when paired with Isao) would do old Leda's parts. Resuming Leda is Leda, Takayoshi take the Mikio place of learn both parts and Isao take Takayoshi's role. I dont know how Yusuke Hiraga fit in this, and now there is a lot of new songs and I dont know their dinamic yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is a BIG change. The finamic of the show changed. MG Tour in Japan looks more like a Perfume concert thana Babymetal one. Compare that with for example ROR video and the level of enrrgy is different. Perfume are good but not one I would be fan. For a one time tour is Ok but I still feel since 2016 BM is not giving the best of they can do for extrange decisions and sometimes even the effort put on the shows is high. I feel they owed a show like Legend S quality with the new material.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Then why should be important if they are women or foxes? If Koba need someone to do any job it will choose the better available, like Mikiko or the couple of womans who are composed Babymetal songs, other times he will choose what is available to him in the Amuse staff (like Nora). In any artistic expression, it is a problem to compromise the quality of the result, just because someone requires you to meet a quota of women or something else that any pressure group requires of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Then you really think adding women will improve the quality? There is no evidence in Babymetal about people getting jobs by their gender, except the members of the group and the avengers which are specifically chosen for being female women. Would it improve the quality of the group if we demanded that the avengers be men so that there is at least one man represented on stage? and that we fire Ohmura and BOH to put a female bassist and guitarist, capable but unknown with no history with the group? So instead of commissioning songs to Yuyoyuppe and others (who have made a great work IMHO including a couple of women there), a group of female songwriters are hired who have never worked on metal. For my part I would love that [Yoko Kanno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Kanno) composed a couple of pieces for Babymetal, but that is because I love her work, not because she is a woman.</TEXT>

It is not the first time that you behave like this with me and with many other members of this sub that do not have the kindness to share your vision of the world. I am reporting this behavior, but I do not expect much since you seem to be friends with them since I have never seen this attitude of yours be condemned in this sub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure Satoshi Oka never played with BM. Maybe you are confusing him with Yusuke Hiraga who played in Australia in 2018 and Taiwan in 2019 with BM? Hiraga was an alumn of MI and Fujioka too. Both Oka and Hiraga played in the second [Kari Band album](https://jpurecords.com/blogs/news/kari-band-nimaime).  gt; Samurai Groove  gt; This was made as a sequel to  #8220;Ninja Groove #8221; from our last release. I #8217;d say the highlight is the guitar battle of Mikio Fujioka #8217;s beloved disciples Satoshi Oka and Yusuke Hiraga.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the late 80's when Metal was cool all the heavy music was termed as metal, when starting I remember Guns n Roses and ebven Nirvana being reffered as metal bands. For the first years of the 90's with the rise of grunge and their dispise of overly technichal music and everythig what smell of "not autentic" Metal stopped to be cool and bands run away too be classified as one.</TEXT>
