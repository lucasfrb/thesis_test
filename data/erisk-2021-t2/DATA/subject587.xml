    <TITLE>Has anyone Swapped there Xbox 1 HDD for an SSD?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-14 08:36:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m looking for the opinions and experience of those who have swapped their Xbox 1 #8217;s (OG,S, and X) internal HDD for SSD. I currently use an external SSD for my X and I was thinking of giving my external to a friend if I decided to just install an internal. I also have friends with S and OG Xbones and I just wanted to help them with faster and smoother loads and quality of gaming. So my questions are -Did it increase your performance? -What issues did you have? -What did you use to clone your HDD(methods and software)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Amp Sentrix high capacity batteries</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-19 10:00:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>So mobile sentrix #8217;s amp sentrix battery brand has recently revealed their  #8220;high capacity #8221; batteries. I did some reading into it since I really love their batteries. I noticed that on the iPhone 6 the standard battery mAh is 1810 and 6.91 Wh while the high capacity version its is 2200 mAh and 11.1 Wh. They retain the same voltage. Has anyone used the new batteries yet? Is this safe? I #8217;m pretty excited to start using them but not at the risk of damage to the phone or customer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone have issues when repairing these items? I #8217;ve talked to other techs and we all seem to have the universal issue of lack of touch sensitivity when replacing iPads that have the digitizer and lcd fused together. I #8217;ve tried different suppliers and everything checked my technique and the technique of others. I just wanted to know if you all had the same issues and possibly a reason and solution for these digitizing problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are equally as important to me. For instance, my wife is my family as well now and she isn #8217;t going anywhere. She gets when I get and she also co-own our household. With that being said how she feels about something despite the situation is respected. Now as far as my sister. There #8217;s nothing that can be said to make me not communicate with her help my sister. If she needs a roof or is in financial need and WE can help WE help. A good wife or sister doesn #8217;t try to cause conflict with each other. Now in terms of priority my wife comes first. If her and my sister both ask for something that #8217;s equally important and equally convenient then what my wife ask for gets done first. At the end of the day the life and family I started with my wife is my life. The family before all that still counts and isn #8217;t forgotten. Long story short I balance these things to where I can be a good husband and also be a good brother at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It may be a cultural thing but when I got hair cuts(me and everyone i knew or went to school with or work with etc) would go once a week or when money was tight once a month or before an event. It depended on your barber your hairline etc. i would invest in some good clippers and liners(andis are a great brand and so are wahls) then watch a few youtube videos. I was terrible at first but cutting my hair and my family #8217;s hair got me a skill that saved me a lot of money. I mow have hair that reaches my lower shoulder blades and i still use the clippers i bought years ago(about 5-6) every wee for a shave a taper and a line up(edge). I hope this helps in some sort of way and good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apple is known for lying about stuff like that. They once told me they couldn #8217;t replace my wife #8217;s 4S because the logic board was in the wrong spot. It was total bullshit(I know because i work on phones not that they needed to know that). We just had it replaced by them for the same issue it was having(something I wasn #8217;t going to fix because they would fix it for free so I wasn #8217;t touching it. Plus I didn #8217;t know how to fix this issue) well when we had the issue again and brought it back within a month or two they were rude and accused us of all kinds of things. We just left and i had to spend a day learning how to fix something I didn #8217;t want to fix(seeing as how it was a broadband chip issue and I wasn #8217;t able to repair any board related things back then). I say this to say try bringing it in to a different location and see if someone there has an ounce of humanity and is willing to help otherwise you may want to try a 3rd party repair shop.</TEXT>

In my particular instance, he had me trade 2 of 3 masterballs for a Zeraora and then disconnected at 2 obviously without giving me Zeraora. I understood wanting to trade Zeraora last bcs of people who scam so i agreed to getting it on the 3rd ball. This was when he disconnected. I #8217;ve heard of him stealing in other 2:1 trades 3:1 trades as well. So do be careful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So normally I don #8217;t have an issue with my connection at all(always full bars, connected through ethernet, and 1Gbps internet) and I #8217;ve never taken any of my friends who constantly  #8220;lag #8221; seriously. As of lately(past week) I #8217;ve still had all my green bars but have been lagging pretty bad, me and everyone one else I #8217;ve asked. Are you all having this problem? Is there a reason this is happening? Just really curious about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I try to back my wife and I #8217;s devices up once a week. Well today after her logic board died, I pulled out the spare phone. When I went to restore it from backup none of our backups were there! I plugged my phone in and it said the last backup for my device was unknown. I #8217;ve never had this happen before. Has anyone else had this issue? Is there a resolution? If not I may have to come out of pocket for trying to have it recovered from her dead phone. There #8217;s a lot of memories on that phone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did the clean install BEFORE I used it. And let me be clear. I #8217;m not wondering where ALL of my stuff went because I reset my computer. Thats not the case. I did the clean install long ago. Two backups that were indeed successful are no longer present. I back up EVERY Wednesday. When her device stopped working I was confident her data was the least of our worries. I connect her replacement today and it did not have her backup. I noticed mine was not there either. I unplugged the replacement and plugged my phone in only to see the computer said my phone #8217;s last backup to this mac is  #8220;unknown #8221;. This is what is perplexing me. If it were as simple as me personally deleting them or never backing them up then I wouldn #8217;t have made the post. I #8217;m just deeply confused with this situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m from Louisiana. Mardi gras and bourbon have been empty. It #8217;s because of the fact people aren #8217;t taking it seriously enough. They #8217;re still out and having get togethers and saying ignorant shit and being just plain stupid. They #8217;re running around refusing to believe its that bad. Then we have people hoarding lysol. It upsets me because I #8217;ve always bought lysol I #8217;ve always had two cans and now I can #8217;t have any. I have a pretty healthy colon so I keep a decent amount of toilet paper and that #8217;s becoming a struggle to find. Another factor is the fact Louisiana is poor. Very poor. So people feel like they HAVE to go to work because who #8217;s going to pay these bills. The business I work in is essential but me and another coworker were allowed paid leave. He #8217;s diabetic and I have family that I take care of and can #8217;t afford to be exposed . Part of me feels guilt that I #8217;m not out there helping but the selfless and responsible thing to do is stop the spread of this. Yet at my job all I hear is stubborn elderly people and ignorant uneducated buffoons running around talking about what they #8217;re not afraid of and how it #8217;s not what the media is making it. I was telling an older gentleman that we have been having trouble keeping stock in because the coronavirus is affecting china so badly and he just refused to believe it. When my buddy said it was also Chinese new year he had the fucking nerve to say  #8220;okay y #8217;all redeemed yourselves because there #8217;s no way this virus is this bad #8221; it pissed me off. For a long time I #8217;ve been upset that Louisiana is so poor and corrupt. The books I had in school were super outdated. I #8217;m mostly self educated. And you know what the lack of education here shows. These ignorant stubborn ridiculous morons won #8217;t stop having gatherings and sit the fuck down for the rest of us. I #8217;ve been being strong in front of my family but I have elderly that I care about. Customers, parents and grandparents. I have a fairly young child. I have a sister with lupus and I have an aunt with lupus. I #8217;M TIRED OF PEOPLE NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!!</TEXT>

Personally I over explain everything to both genders no matter what for 2 reasons. Reason one I find that the majority of people need their hands held through everything. Reason 2 once someone finally gets my usually quiet ass to start talking idk how to shut the hell up. I try to speak in a way where I assume what I #8217;m speaking of is new to who I #8217;m speaking to. If I find that they know a little or a lot I dial my explanation back until it #8217;s just to people equally babbling about some nonsense subject.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Training mode homie practice true combos and spacing. Then practice strings and dodge reads. Also watch your replays and observe your mistakes. Don #8217;t continue ranked while you #8217;re frustrated either. Stop take a deep breath and go practice. It #8217;ll add up. Observe other players who use your characters or weapons and see how they punish or react to certain situations. Edit: Bonus tip(sort of a no brainer) if you like using a certain character make sure you can use BOTH of their weapons. Its okay to be better with one than the other but be able to effectively fight with BOTH if your character #8217;s weapons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My point still stands. If I #8217;m not OT but the pokemon has amazing stats and is shiny then someone is cheating themselves if they #8217;re overly cautious and miss the trade. Now I get it if its a nicknamed level 100 6iv hidden ability shiny pokerus and I #8217;m not the OT then okay yeah likely hacked and you should be concerned. Lastly if neither of us can tell if it #8217;s hacked(reasonable ivs but shiny etc) and we have to wonder wether it is or not then it doesn #8217;t really matter. The pokemon is clearly legal and fair enough to where it can be used. Not saying that hacking and making a competitive team is okay but if no one can tell then why even be concerned. There #8217;s clearly no advantage or difference between it and the natural real deal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes breed with ivs as high as possible. Destiny knot guarantees that both 5 best ivs are passed down between both parents(which ivs they oass down are random) and 1 is always random(and likely not best). Even with 2 5 best iv mon you could end up passing down both parents one non perfect iv and then getting its one random one as a non perfect as well resulting in a 3 best iv baby. Long story short prepare yourself for a lot of eggs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well my friend as common as it #8217;s said...there are plenty  #8220;the ones #8221; the one is someone who #8217;s willing to make it work as much as you are. Someone willing to accept flaws and help you better yourself. Someone who #8217;s going to walk the walk of life with you while you mutually help each other reach your goals. If this person didn #8217;t end up lasting it #8217;s okay. You don #8217;t have to immediately get past the break up pain but enjoy that chapter of your life with them and keep going. You WILL find the real one and when you do it WILL last. That sort of mindset should help you adapt to your new life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh I mean I think it #8217;s bcs there #8217;s a certain excitement and good feeling when guys receive a nude. Especially an unsolicited one. Problem is what not all of us realize is it #8217;s not the same for women. We might be like  #8220;idk her but I give the tiddy a 10/10 #8221; but ladies only want those pictures(and even then maybe not) from objects of their affection. Additionally the penis just doesn #8217;t photograph well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I partially disagree. While I agree that it #8217;s good for advice I know for a fact most people who play this game don #8217;t want advice on how to get better. They want to whine and complain and win every game without actually honing any skill. They only see an issue when they fall short and in their mind its everyone else #8217;s fault. I feel like that describes 35%-50% of this game and hell most games even.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with that. I #8217;ve heard so many people rage and complain but few who say how can I get better and avoid this. Thats why I never offer advice, I just wait until someone specifically asks me. Hate wasting my breath on someone who #8217;s not going to use the advice just cry about it and say how much they hate the game(but still plays it).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>iPhone 6 board failure right after installing battery</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 03:13:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alright everyone I #8217;ve been working with mobile devices for quite awhile and for the first time in awhile I #8217;m baffled. The other day I was working on a regular iphone 6 battery replacement. Checked the health(11%) and tested a new battery before fully installing everything worked fine. Went ahead and did the full replacement and went to power the phone back on and I got the apple briefly then it was dead. I plugged the phone into our tester and it was pulling power but significantly less than what is normal. If I waited a few I can hold the power button and again get a brief apple. I didn #8217;t do anything ridiculous like like pry at the connector with something metal it was just business as usual. Correct tools, correct battery, and correct procedure. I tried the old battery and then another new battery but still got the same results. What could I have done? Some insight on this would be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No my complaint is exactly as I said it. The reason I say its to show off is bcs no matter what you give this is the case. Now I can get your point of view. Those are understandable points definitely. But if that #8217;s the case that isn #8217;t who I #8217;m talking to. The same people who are showing off are the same people in the gts with their shinies posted asking for trades that you can #8217;t physically make happen.(looking for level 1-10 Zacian etc). I #8217;m not saying everyone who goes through trades is doing this. Not once but what I am saying is for the people who are doing that tho. Also just like there #8217;s a better way for me to randomly giveaway an extra shiny or legendary that I have there #8217;s a better to trade for shinies you don #8217;t have. Long story short, the people I #8217;m talking to know who they are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I support the recreational use of weed. But I #8217;ll tell you if you #8217;re using it as a bandage or an escape then its not a good idea. Whatever issue you #8217;re having address it with a sober mind and get passed it. Then once you #8217;ve confronted and defeated the issue or issues, you enjoy that smoke.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been there before man. I totally understand. I normally would say yeah use it and work it out at the same time but what that usually leads to is using it as a bandaid and then when it doesn #8217;t help you escape or feel good anymore you chase another good feeling like pills or alcoholism. I #8217;m not trying to preach the narrative that weed is a gateway but its really easy to fall into a bigger issue.</TEXT>

When transferring true tone to a new screen can I just use an original apple screen and transfer it to the whole screen inventory?

    <TEXT>Idk right now. I #8217;ll have to wait until 3am when I #8217;m trying to sleep for me to randomly remember. Edit: its now 3am here comes the cringe This one is small but still haunts me. I played what we call city league basket ball as a kid. Long story short we went out to eat in celebration and randomly I decide to tell the star player(someone I never really talk to btw) that I ate bugs before.....while he was eating. No reason to do this but naturally as a kid I didn #8217;t see the weirdness until after. In 5th grade the class was doing sketches on peer pressure. We #8217;d get paired randomly and randomly do a peer pressure related skit we made up on the fly. Well I thought edgy anime characters were cool at the time so you can only imagine my mindset. Kid asked me did I want drugs or something and in front of everyone the whole class I turned away with my hands in my jacket and lowly said  #8220;not even in an alternate dimension #8221; but my body language made it soooo much worse. There was an awkward silence and he replies with  #8220;well we aren #8217;t in an alternate dimension so do you want the drugs or not? #8221; The shit was hilarious and everyone laughed and I wasn #8217;t prepared for a reply. I was in instant embarrassment. Worse part about this is we were ON CAMERA. So somewhere in the world there #8217;s a video of some nerd kid who thinks he should model his personality(or lack there of) after weird haired anime school boys with magical powers(which I obviously lacked).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Short answer is at the end but you may want to read this: Its possible you could have a people problem or just not really be interested in that sort of relationship right now. Observe people and their interactions and evaluate. See if you don #8217;t have certain interactions by choice or if you just can #8217;t control the atmosphere. Then check and see if that helps or harms your social life or ability to communicate. Next up you #8217;re a senior so its not necessarily a bad thing that you #8217;ve put your energy and focus in school and other activities you like as opposed to the constant care, focus, time, and maintenance of a relationship. It #8217;s a lot of energy and it #8217;s borderline annoying. I started dating around age 13 and actually putting effort into a relationship at 14/15. Completely unnecessary. Especially at that age when you #8217;re emotionally immature. Have no means of knowing how a relationship even Is supposed to work and no time for that shit at all really. I say from the standpoint that relationships are a distraction at that age you #8217;re doing well. Now one drawback is is that by the time you do start dating most people will have had some dating experience. Knowing what to expect whats okay and whats not okay(also largely dependent upon who you #8217;re dating but there #8217;s a general foundation of etiquette you follow). Again all things you learn by living life and making mistakes. Just be man enough to own up to your mistakes and do better. Short answer though around 16 is the generally accepted age from what I #8217;ve seen in life and sitcoms. Edit: Warned you about my text wall. Happy Cake Day</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could be an issue with the logic board considering the severe damage it took. Did you try plugging it in to charge after the repairs? If plugging it in got no response try a wireless charger to see if the issue is the charging port. If that didn #8217;t work and iTunes doesn #8217;t recognize it when plugged into a computer it #8217;s likely an issue with the board that #8217;ll require microsoldering.

Really helped me take the time to pick myself back up and I later gave that advice to someone who had just lost their wife and wanted to somehow help his kids through it. I was telling him to seek some therapy and take some time if needed then he #8217;ll have a clear mind to help them confront their loss as well(much longer story). Made me feel good that my father had gave me that wisdom and I gave it too. On a lighter note, my father also told me  #8220;A woman knows wether she would want to sleep with you when she first sees you. it #8217;s just up to you not to say anything stupid to ruin it #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bcs normally your body releases some sort of hormone keeping your ass in place and not doing too much moving so that way you won #8217;t act out your dreams. Its also why some people experience sleep paralysis and can be conscious but physically cannot move. Sleep walkers tend to not produce this hormone I believe or at least not enough? Im not sure about that and will be googling it later. I also suspect children don #8217;t have a fully developed whatever it is that excretes it bcs they tend to do back flips and cartwheels in their sleep and what feels like full on Kung fu if your child falls asleep in your bed. But thats why you don #8217;t fall out of your bed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of these idiots still think its some how more boxing or manly to sit still and trade punches. Some how if you allow them to hit you it #8217;ll prove who #8217;s the better fighter. It #8217;s human instinct to idk uh get the fuck out of the way. It aggravates me to hear people who #8217;ve had 2 fights in their life criticize boxers who are the ones taking blows to the face and liver from miniature mac trucks. I love to see a boxer with evasive skill. I like seeing destructive power too but a mixture of the two shows great skill and strength.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what I #8217;ve been saying. I got written up for going to use the restroom. I really had to go, I asked the teacher said no but then someone else asked he said yes so I went. During a video about the biggest storms in history btw. He was so infuriated that I took it upon myself to leave after he was unfair to me that he screamed and put me out of class when I finished. They called my mother bcs they wrote me up and she tore them a new one. I hate that these teachers are sometimes just weak and miserable and get satisfaction out of bullying and intimidating children bcs they #8217;re helpless in their own pathetic lives. Not all teachers tho.</TEXT>

He said listen just stay out of trouble. I remember her asking me about it when I got home and she got mad at them all over again. She went on a huge rant and basically said if my son has to go to that restroom at any point in the day I better not hear again that it was a problem. Made me feel good she had my back bcs the school will lie to get the parents on their sides. I get we were kids and did dumb things but those teachers were vindictive.</TEXT>

I used to think about the good ole days a lot. I stopped and realize everyone everyone says everything will be better in the future or they want to go back to the past. Today is just as good but we let it pass us by wanting and wishing for the past and future but all you have to do is make it what you want it to be.

    <TEXT>Nah. The issue is people have the issue with making fantasies about their objects of affection before getting to know them. Then they disappoint themselves rushing into a relationship and it not going how they want. So long story short its easier to get to know someone for who they are rather than try to change them later.</TEXT>
