    <TEXT>Thread got reset so I'll post this here again... *Just thinking some plan and which direction I would go in playing this game... I want to know which plan is better and give me the best value and worth... Plan 1: Save crystals for black friday sale (maybe around 4000-5000 crystals)... then get mystique... Also, if Sentinel is available in the biometrics selector... I can farm him in the next few months... and buy the Nimrod uniform during the sale... P.S: Yelena Belova is also an option (How do I get her??? Can she be selected through buometrics???) Plan 2: Save crystals to buy one epic quest deluxe package... maybe the wolverine epic quest for jean or the guardians epic quest for gladiator or others (if you have suggestions)... Regarding plan 2.2 I currently have 1570 crystals and I'm planning to buy the taskmaster uniform once it got on sale (earlier or during black friday sale)... base on the last sale it would cost me 1050 crystals and I would be left with 520 after the purchase... I want to know how much and how long will it take me to farm 6600 crystals (excluding event or character level up achievement crystals)??? *I started playing this game more than 1 month ago... I know I'm still an infant in this game... but I want to know and get advice on what did you do when you are on this stage of your account... how did you improve your game/account??? *For reference-IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really like to get Jean as I know she's the strongest character in the game... however I'm actually torn between the gotg and jean's epic quest... As I find it easier to get gladiator than jean... With the gotg epic quest... I already have 6* cgr (not sure of he's included), starlord and nebula (the 3 of them are kinda cheap to t2)... Darkhawk, I'm alloting some biometrics selector on him to get him to t2... Nova, I don't know if the biometrics you can get from the deluxe package is enough to t2 him... Phylavell a mt2 can save me... With Jean's epic quest... I can use mt2 (is it possible???) on Magneto (I know he's one of the strong characters too... one of the reason why I'm torn between the two)... the problem that I have is that wolvie isnt 6* yet... cyc and rogue at 3* and storm at 1* (t1)... I can only get 10 rogue biometrics per day right now... cyc and storm still locked... From what I know its not easy to farm their biometrics, danger room is one place you can farm but it depend s on pure luck... my mkc, mks and feathers are around 500-600... so even if I have 6600 right now and buy the deluxe package... it will be a long time before I unlock jean... (and I'm thinking if I should farm their resources first) 1 epic quest is easy but the characters are not that meta... the other epic quest have 2 or 3 or 4 characters (jean, magneto, cyc wolvie, dont know about storm and rogue) that can be classified as meta... I really don't know which direction I should go...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, during round 14 of alliance battle, I always miss the extreme mode because I am lacking a speed supervillain... I always see yelena at the front of the list of characters I can use... however I only have her at 2 star... So, I am thinking whether to build her or not... I have some questions about her... 1. Can you farm her through biometrics selector??? 2. If you can farm her through biometrics selector, how much does it cost to get her to T2 (all materials needed and their cost)??? (I think this is a manual and hard grind method) 3. A convenient way to get her is through the Legendary Battle by paying 2500 crytals and you can get her at 6 stars already... If you do get her from Legendary Battle, how much does it cost to get her to T2 (all materials needed and their cost)??? I am currently saving crystals to buy my first ever eq deluxe pack but this situation confuse me again.. An eq deluxe pack would cost me 6600 crystals... Buying Yelena in Legendary Battle and her uniform would cost around 3550-4250 crystals depending on the uniform discount... I need some advice on what should I do.... Nova v.s Yelena, which character would I get the most value??? Is it worth it to delay buying my first ever deluxe pack for yelena??? P.S: I heard she's good in pvp... she can also help me in that area... I just got demoted from gold league last week to silver league this week...

    <TEXT>So, I can get the 6* rank up ticket tomorrow from future pass... Should I use it to darkhawk??? Is he a good character and worth it to use it on him??? (If I use it on darkhawk I need to wait for 2 weeks to t2 him... I can get atleast 400 bios from shadowland to upgrade his gears to 20 and wait for the regular advance t2 ticket from the check in)... Or should I save it and use it on a more difficult character??? Since I miss doing 1 mission the other day I am now 10 tokens less to get the mega advance t2 ticket... So mind as well get an item that can help me in my mission to T3 Black Widow... I can get 1 Titan Book Selector and 5* rank up ticket or 100 CCF Pack and 5* rank up ticket which is the best to get??? (BTW... I have 7 Speed Titan Books and 700 CCF)... If I do save my 5* and 6* regular rank up ticket... which is the best character to use it??? Perhaps cyc,rogue or storm??? Is there a much difficult character to rank up that can benefit from the 5* and 6* rank up ticket??? (P.S: I know that you need a character atleast at 4* to use this tickets)...

    <TEXT>So, I got the Thor: Ragnarok uni for card purposes... and I got curious, in marvel universe (comics and mcu) thor is probably one of the strongest heroes... maybe on par or a little bit stronger than jean grey... In this game I wonder how strong he is??? If you rank him, what would be his meta ranking??? I feel like he should be atleast jean grey level or SS level kind of character but sadly base on what I see he's not (maybe I'm wrong)... I'm thinking whether to invest on him and make him my first universal T3(overall, in movies and comics etc. I like this character much better than CM... and he has a movie coming out in the near future so there's a little chance that he might get an upgrade just like how bw get an upgrade because of her movie)... I wonder what is his T3 value??? Is it a good investment to T3 him??? Also, I just recruited quicksilver... Is there a list of how much and what resources it will cost to upgrade him from level 1 to 60, 1* to 6* (including mastery), level 61 to 70 and advancing him to T3???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will be getting 100 bio selector tomorrow from the check in event and 225 bio selector this coming week from shadowland... Should I use it to rank sharog (I have around 160 bios of her) starnight uniform to mythic???

    <TEXT>This is the last week of the 5th anniversary 8 week check in rewards... Will there be another 8 week check in event??? Is there any big events that is related to marvel future fight that will warrant this kind of events??? If yes, what are the usual rewards??? I wonder are there any players here that doesn't have or didn't prioritize buying the EQ deluxe pack??? What's the difference of having it and not having it??? I currently have 2700+ crytals... I think I will buy the hero quest crystal chest tomorrow so that's +600... with the daily mission tomorrow (+25), check in event crystal (+300)... I will have atleast 3600+ crystals tomorrow... Also, planning to buy 200 crytals in the upcoming dollar deals in the next month and another hero quest chest if it gets refilled... this is the only purchase that I plan and not planning on purchasing anything next year... (P.S: I originally plan to buy stark stash but I don't have any patience to wait for 1 month before I get the full prize of my purchase)... I want some advice on how to spend crystals... I actually plan to get an eq deluxe pack but I am getting impatient in saving 6600 crystals... I plan to purchase hela ragnarok uni (ctpe purposes) next uni sale... also I plan to get starlord uni the next sale after hela (I plan to finish gotg eq so that I can get him at T3 and BRB at 60/6/6... maybe in 2 months he's already T3 or close to T3 so that's the right time to get his uniform)... Here's my dillema: After I do this I can save whatever crystals I earn for the gotg deluxe eq and maybe I can buy it by black friday sale or early/mid december (is it worth it to wait that long?)... However, I am tempted to buy Taskmaster, Colossus (planning to use MT2 ticket on him the moment I got my hand on one) and Rogue (farming her biometrics and if I have enough I will advance her to T2) uniform so that I can improve them... there's also Odin that is needed to awaken BRB (maybe I can use the 1500 crystal I can get back on him... if I do buy a deluxe pack)... So this things are messing my mind... What should I do??? I badly need your advice so that I know what way should I take... IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

My target is to buy the hela ragnarok uni for CTPE purpose next uniform sale... and starlord uni the next uniform sale after hela... maybe my starlord would be close to T3 or already T3 during that time (roughly 2 months from now)... After that I plan to buy a deluxe pack and then probably mystique (or any suggestions) during black friday sale... I hope I'll be able to save enough to do this...

Is it really worth it to finish this epic quest??? How much can T3 Starlord and BRB at 60/6/6 (Level 70 after a few weeks) will improve my current roster??? Should I do this slowly??? Does finishing this epic quest the best way for me to improve my roster??? Is there any characters that can improve my roster better (1 or 2 or even 3 characters)??? Need some advice...

    <TEXT>After I finish the GotG epic quest I'll be having 2 really good (probably above average/a level or two below than sharog and luna?) character... Starlord T3 and BRB... with them it will help me improve my PvE content...

So, I need some advice on what roster (who should be the lead, support and main damage dealer???) might be good (taking note of my current roster) and will improve my timeline battle... currently at Gold League (2%-10%) an improvement from last week's Gold League (26%)... (P.S #1: I'm saving for the GotG deluxe pack... but I might buy it around November/Black Friday Sale... it might be a long time before I can get Nova) (P.S #2: I might have problems with resources if some things coincides with me finishing the GotG epic quest... so, I want a slowly but surely advice) IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was at your place I bought sharog's uniform... sharog is the best if not one of the best character in the game when it comes to PvE... getting her latest uniform will just make her better... I think most of the players here in community might suggest sharog and her latest uniform (Starnight)... When it comes to her gameplay most player say that her gameplay is one of the easiest... and base on my experience (been using her since day 1-she's also my strongest character along with my Black Widow-the 2 of them are my only T3) she's really easy to use... P.S: You might want to read Cynicalex progress guide or his guides about new players (you can see it at the description of his videos)... there are also guides here in this subreddit... I just don't have a link but if you search it you'll find it... its really useful... I wish I read it first before making my early decisions...</TEXT>

I don't know about the stats of Cap Am Hydra uniform (I don't have his uniform)... so I don't know how good he is on that uniform... Well, its your first purchase anyways you'll definitely buy some uniforms in the future... Also, always wait for uniform sale after your first purchase... it will help a lot in saving crystals... To be sure wait for other players reply so that you'll have more opinions and suggetions...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply... I can T2 wasp in 3 days after I have enough rift tokens to buy her bios from the dimension shop... I can use the regular T2 advancement ticket that I will get from the last day of the 5th year anniversary check in (we can get that monthly so it's not that rare) on her... I'm saving resources like cns for the gotg epic quest so using the regular T2 is the best way... my weekly reset in TB is friday so she would be ready for a new week.. I do have a few questions: 1. Do I need wasp's latest uniform or I only need her at T2??? 2. It will be a few weeks time before a uniform sale... or I can get Taskmaster uni right now (I have 3200+ crystals)??? P.S: My target is to buy Hela uni if there's a uni sale for ctp purposes, another is starlord uni but that's after I finish the epic quest and have him at T3 (I think it will take around 2 mos., I have some missions though that I can accomplish immediately-punisher and darkhawk is already at T2), last thing that I want to buy is the gotg deluxe pack by black friday and build Nova from then... 3. How should I build Wasp and Taskmaster??? My current build is not that good P.S: I also don't have good obelisk... I don't know why I can't craft a good one... so, I might not be able to give them 6* good obelisks... 4. I usually play widow 5 then as she comes down from helicopter or sometimes when the lightning appears I use 4... if T3 is available 5 then as she comes down T3... I don't know if I am playing her properly... If I can improve my gameplay I kindly ask for your tips...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have some realization after watching some videos by mff youtubers... I decided not to focus on buying the GotG epic quest deluxe pack for now... Nova will be another character that I will have a hard time to build... So here's some of the things I plan to do after my realiziation and I want your opinions and suggestion on this: A. Next all uniform sale I will buy Loki and Hela's uniform to get the last Loki Card and a CTP of Energy. Another uniform I might get is Taskmaster uniform for TLB support... (Starlord uni is another candidate and that's if I have him at T3 during that time... if not next uni sale then)... B. I'm inclined in finishing the GotG epic quest since I can get two really good characters... however, the expensive cost in doing this epic quest is making me hesitate... I think I can finish the X-men epic quest and doctor strange epic quest if I don't do this epic quest... (Reference: https://m.imgur.com/a/rMU2ssS)... You might have another opinions or thoughts on this... Between Starlord T3/BRB (I might not be able to awaken him until I see Odin's rework... even then building him up is still expensive) and Wolverine/ Doctor Strange... Which do you think have a much better overall value??? C. Legendary Battle v.s Deluxe Pack... Most people choose deluxe pack for lifetime farming of resources... however, some people say you can farm those resources one way or the other (like the 6* ISO-8 boost if you reach 300k points in two weeks abx that's 14 6* ISO-8 boost plus those 6* ISO-8 you get at 100k points)... Legendary Battle packs is probably chosen by some for its CTP rewards... and if you buy a good LB pack you can get some good rewards too... so, I wonder what's your preference and your opinion about it??? D. For my target T3's... if I do finish the GotG epic I'll have T3 Starlord, next would be Luna Snow, Thor and Hulk (*if he's good with the upcoming update)... If I don't finish the gotg epic quest and finish the other 2 it will be Luna (*ASAP since I won't be spending T3 mats on the other 2 epic quest)... then it will be Wolverine/Strange/Thor/Hulk... P.S: Thor is always one of my targets because he's my favorite character... and I have already 10 universal titan record books... (I know CM is strong but I don't have fun in playing her)...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright thanks for the feedback... I might get Colossus uni if I get my hand on a MT2 ticket and T2 him... I have VIP 1 and earn a decent amount of gold everyday... I guess I'll just buy what I need the most... T3'ing Luna might set back and slow down my epic quest but since I'll have a roadblack when Phylavell mission comes up it's not bad to T3 her first... all in all thanks for the insight...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just got my Luna Snow to Level 70... So, how much resources will it cost to upgrade her gears from 20-25 and taking her to T3??? I'm kinda leaning on Legendary Battle packs now than the EQ deluxe packs... There are packs that have really good rewards with doing a small sacrifice in resources, which in return can actually help in some ways... I wonder what's your opinion: Legendary Battle Packs v.s Deluxe Pack??? P.S: Looks like the upcoming update looks underwhelming... (Immortal Hulk that can't revive and a super villain... whew)... hope they'll fix some things before it goes live...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just got back from a very stressful Danger Room (week's worth of getting a win on first try gone to waste with 5/6 straight loss... got demoted to Platinum)... and Timeline Battle (9-1 and 8-2 the past 2 days got a record of 6-4 today... currently 23-7, 39% Platinum League)... Now, I just want to ask how can I improve in this three game mode: World Boss (Ultimate), Alliance Battle (Extreme) and Timeline Battle??? Currently: World Boss - 1 Clear Normal (with Darkhawk) - 4 Clears Ultimate, Level 9 (with CM, Luna, BW and Sharon) - I can only play level 9 in ultimate mode for now since I don't have the required toons to go to level 10 Alliance Battle (Extreme) - Round 1 to 12, I can score atleast 100 k and 300 k (if I can use my T3's)... - Round 13 I can score less than 100 k with Minn Erva - Round 14 I can't play extreme mode at all cause I don't have the required toons (Speed/Villain?) Timeline Battle - Current lineup that I'm using is Wasp (L), Sharon and BW... since CM is banned in Platinum League this week - Will get Taskmaster uni (along with Loki and Hela uni) at the next uni sale so that I'll have a good support with Tasky and Wasp lead... - One problem that I'll have is if BW got banned for a week... it will only be CM I can use in TLB if she's not banned... I don't think I can get some wins with her... - I'm in dillemma whether to go for the PVP meta but that will make me invest a huge amount of resources and probably slow my progress... (?) - Also, if Wasp got killed first since she's on the frontline will her effect gonna be remove??? If it's gonna be remove, what's the best timing to switch to Widow??? Wasp and Sharon are sacrificed sometimes, but Sharon can sometimes kill one or both of Jean's Grey life.... Jean, Thanos and SS (I avoid the team that have him on the lineup) are really a pain in the ass... IGN: Vincent 037... any advice will be a huge help...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Currently, in a dillemma whether to save to build and T3 Silver Surfer (T2/1*) or go with my original plan of T3'ing Luna (T2/Lvl. 70) and finishing the gotg (58%) epic quest... either of the two would take 3/4/5 mos... Focusing on Silver Surfer, I can get a meta in PVP and he's also good in PVE (downside he's only one character)... Focusing on T3' Luna Snow and finishing the GotG epic quest, I can get 3 really good PVE (only? I don't know if 1 of them have value in PVP) characters- T3 Starlord and Luna, a BRB that can go to lvl. 70 unawakened (P.S: Odin is expensive too)... Help me to weight this things... and I need your advice and opinions on what's the best thing to do...

However, I'm having a hard time managing them... I need some advice on which character should I focus my attention to... Basically I can use two methods to acquire biometrics right now... I can use the Dimension Support Shop for the characters available there and the weekly 225 bio selector from shadowland... (P.S: The moment I have enough tokens I'm gonna get Hela's bios from the support shop to 6* her... since I'll be buying her uni together with Loki's uni... to get the LB rewards) Now, after that I don't know what's my next step??? Should I collect as many 6* T1 characters as possible??? Or I should bring to T2 the characters that can be advance??? (P.S: I'm alloting my BAM and CNS in T3'ing Luna and doing the GotG epic quest)... Which characters should I get from the Support Shop and the 225 bio selectors from shadowland??? I would appreciate it if you can rank them from first to last.... IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With regards to cards I have a 5* Uncanny Xmen #8 (the bishop one) Card that have skill cooldown on its optional stats (the blue one) for now... If I replace the Luna card with the last Loki P-card I wonder if it's a good idea to replace the starlord one with that card... I don't think it's good to loose the 10% skill cooldown from the Luna card rigt now...(?) I also have a Loki Card that have #6 on it at 5* and have 9% of the orange stats... I'm thinking to replace the other one that have 1 on it once I rank it to 6*... I haven't gotten on the mission where you need to 3* or 5* them... I have 6* colossus so that might not hinder me... but Phylavell and the others will definitely be a huge roadblock... I guess I should do all of them until I reach that point... P.S: I got the 50 X-gene selector from the X-Men cyclops hidden missions... Who should I select Kid Omega or Nightcrawler??? Or Rogue for added bios so that I can upgrade her gears to 20 and when I have the monthly T2 regular advancement ticket this month... I can use it on her??? P.S #2: Thanks for all your replies...

Looking at the next missions I notice that I already remove a huge roadblock (Colossus) since I already have him at 6*... I have enough resources to do the research missions... aside from the search mission and 2 timeline battle win 10x that will take a few days... I think I can finish this epic quest... Or do I need to buy the deluxe pack to unlock The Big Twin??? I think there's a mission on that area(??) Let's say I finish this epic quest... at T2 6/6/60 with no uni, how good is deadpool??? Which game mode he can be useful (WBU, ABX, AC, TLB, Shadowland)??? P.S: Still debating whether to buy the new hulk uni and build him (I have him at 4*)... One of the reason is if ever BW got banned (Does she get banned?) in TLB I don't have any spare heroes that can really help me... Some players say he's good, some say he's bad, some say he's good but you don't actually need him... Now I wonder... considering my current roster status and game status (IGN: Vincent 037)... How good is he??? How can he help me??? What can he bring to my roster if I build him??? Will he be a good addition to my roster??? Will he be worth it to spend resources and 1050 crystals???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have 4000+ crytals and 28 days left on my stark stash subscription... I can earn atleast 2800 crystals in the next 28 days (75 + 25 from daily task)... Should I buy: A. 3 uni next all uni sale (Hela, Loki, Taskmaster/Hulk) B. GotG deluxe pack (there's an option of waiting for BF sale before buying this pack) C. 2 uni next all uni sale (Hela  amp; Loki, Hela  amp; Taskmaster/Hulk, Loki  amp; Taskmaster/Hulk) D. 1 uni next all uni sale (Hela/Loki/Taskmaster/Hulk) E. Others (any suggestions on what's a better and worth it way to spend) I'm buying Hela and Loki's uni for the P-card and CTPE... If you have time to look into my account (IGN: Vincent 037)... Do you think buying Loki's uni is a must right now looking at the status of my card??? Or it could wait till bf sale??? Same with Hela is it a must right now or it could wait till BF??? BTW, I have a 4* Groot #5 card... It have a fixed stat of Ig. Defense  amp; Crit. Damage at 6% and optional stat of Skill Cooldown and another stat (I forgot) at 5.1 %... should I replace my Starlord card with it??? (I remember RealYig suggested this to me) P.S: I only have 2000 Phoenix Feathers and M'kraan Crystals... Two epic quests (GotG and X-Force) needs to spend atleast 12000 each of those... I'm in dilemma on where to spend it... Status: GotG epic quest, I can mostly do the missions... however, I have a huge road block with PhylaVell (it will take time before I rank her up to 3* and 5*) X-Force epic quest... I can finish this epic quest without a road block... since I already have Colossus at 6*... Should I alot the resources to finish the X-Force epic quest already??? Or use it for the GotG???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh I forgot the other resources... my focus is on Phyla since she's the road block and it will take a long time to 3* and 5* her... I have 500+ CCF but I'm saving for Luna right now... guess that answer the question... hahaha... From what I remember the Ignore Defense on the Starlord card is at 7%... and I don't know if the optional stats are good... I actually enjoy all modes... so I don't actually know which side I like more... the way I see the game is that you collect toons make them stronger, use them on the game modes to collect more materials and then use those materials to get more toons and make them stronger... it's like a cycle... P.S: This is from what I know and correct me if I'm wrong... but for me, I don't see TLB as PVP since it's not live... you don't play with other players on real time(?)... you get to play their set characters I think.. so, although you go agains't the player you choose... it is still controlled by an ai/computer/cpu... the way I see it... it is like WBU the only difference is there's ranking, different reward and the bosses have owners... I don't know if this make sense... but if it's possible I want to be good overall... that's probably the reason why I'm always confuse on what to do...</TEXT>

In what order should I advance them??? * After I get enough Bios for Hulk from the bio selectors I can get to rank him to 6*, upgrade his gears to 20 and advance him to T2...

    <TEXT>Alright... I use the dimension mission to farm uniform XP, character XP and 7 DM rewards... I ran 35 autoplays per day... I only played a full run of the story mode for 2 days (reflecting on what you say I might stop it)... but, I usually use the Clear method in clearing epic quest (Level 60-? Stage)... I have T3 Sharog, BW and gonna T3 Luna as soon as I get 4 speed books and 200 CCF (I don't have any drop the last 3 days)... Maybe it's too early but I'm just scouting on the possible next T3... Starlord from the GotG epic quest is on top but since I'm gonna use the 1200 M'kraan Crystals and Phoenix Feathers on the X-force epic quest so that I can finish it... It will take sometime to refill those resources... and there's also the PhylaVell road block so I think it will take a bit longer to finish the epic quest... Thanks for reply...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if I have the patience to force close and farm phyla bios manually... I might wait for a chance to earn MRUT or a regular RUT (but from what I see this things are rare nowadays)... I might take longer than expected... With this in mind... If I have the resources and can T3 one character before I finish the GotG epic quest mind as well do it... that's why I'm scouting which character are good candidates for my next T3... P.S: One of the reason why I'm tempted to build Hulk and buy his uni is that... for me it would be cool to have Cap, Iron Man, Thor and Hulk in my roster... Add hawkeye and I will have the 6 OG avengers... They're the one's that spark my love for superhero movies... I'm actually tempted to T3 (or in Hawkeye's case T2 Lvl. 70) them and ignore the meta and tier list... I'm just weighing what will be the consequence of this... Since, I'm on this topic... What do you think??? I've been thinking this for quite some time... I actually gonna do this... if I haven't read those guides and watch some videos to properly play this game... I know some of them are not that good... but maybe they're not that bad too... What do you think of their value???</TEXT>

With so many things going on (especially during updates) I always find myself get distracted from the important things I should do... (P.S: I always get hypnotized by uniforms)... So, I want ask some advice... 1. What is your T3 strategy??? 2. How do you decide your next T3??? Do you follow the tier/meta list on deciding who's your next T3??? Or you base it on your favorites and ignore the tier list??? 3. When do you start working on Meta characters like Jean, Thanos and SS or the other native T2's??? 4. How do you prioritize building, ranking up and advancing character (T2/T3)??? Do you base it on Shadowland, WBU, ABX or TLB needs??? 5. How do you manage your resources???

Among these uniforms: 1. Loki Ragnarok Uni - Purpose for buying: Premium Card 2. Hela Ragnarok Uni - Purpose for buying: CTP of Energy 3. Cap Hydra Uni - Purpose for buying: ABX (Blast Villain/Blast Male + flexible for Combat Male) 4. Starlord Uni - Purpose for buying: I can't really use him with his current uni... or I don't have anyways to use him right now... and he's at L66 5. Immortal Hulk Uni - Purpose for Buying: Improve Hulk's a lot and could help in ABX Combat Villain day... I have around 4900+ crystals and an on going stark stash... I'm tempted to buy this all at once during the next uni sale... So, I want to ask for your opinions and suggestions... What should be my priority??? Is there a uni that I really need right now??? Is there a uni that will be better for BF sale??? Which among these uni could help my roster improve??? C. What should be a good obelisk for shadowland clearers??? Is a 3* or 4* Obelisk with around 100%-110% damage proc okay???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You will spend all 4k in the coming uni sale??? I'm on the same boat with you... I have around 5k crystals... I was tempted to use this on buying unis too... but I'm hesitating since it's hard to farm crystals... Top of my pick uni's as of now are Loki (for Premium Card), Hydra Cap and Starlord uni... I might change my mind if ever I get something from your question ahahah..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right... I've been playing for more than 2 mos. already... I only have T3 sharog and BW and close to T3 Luna... it makes thing a bit easier but I really feel I don't have any characters that I can really use aside from them... I was considering Hela too for the CTPE... but I changed my mind since I needed to have good characters for ABX and added fire power in WBU... that's why I decided to just buy the Hela uni on BF sale... Loki uni for me is more important because it's a quite easy P-card...</TEXT>

Or Should I use it to recruit Korath, Molten Man and other good villains??? B. The all uni sale is coming in a week or two... I have around 5k crystals... and planning to buy some uni's to improve my characters so that I can achieve better results in WBU and ABX... Some of my options are: 1- Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord / 2 - Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord, Immortal Hulk / 3 - Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord, Winter Soldier (?) / 4 - Loki, Hela, Hydra Cap, Starlord / 5 - Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord, Iron Man (?) Which do you think is the best choice??? You can suggest a different idea or character that you think might be better with the current state of my account and roster... IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

From my view point I don't need Nova... he pretty much bring the same value of the characters I already have if I just give them good uni's... Also, I already have T3 Widow that can cover PVP... I think I can farm the resources that you can get from the deluxe pack somewhere else... Another thing is I'll spend 6600 for one character but my existing characters performs subpar... For me it's not worth it getting a deluxe pack right now... I will get one in the future but top of my list is the Magneto deluxe pack since he's needed for Jean Grey... I might get better value from that deluxe pack...</TEXT>

I might get the endgame uni instead of the hydra cap uni...  #8226;Here's some of my options for the all uni sale in a week or two: 1. Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord 2. Loki, Endgame Cap, Starlord 3. Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord, Iron Man Endgame 4. Loki, Hydra Cap, Starlord, Spider Man FFH 5.

    <TEXT>A. Since I'll be getting the last Loki card in the coming weeks and probably my ignore defense and skill cooldown will reach atleast 30%... I wonder what are some of the good cards that have a fixed stat of All Attack to replace my Starlord card??? B. I kinda decided to spend 5k crystals in the coming all uni sale... I'll definitely buy Loki, Hela, Starlord and Hydra Cap uni... For my 5th option I'm kinda torn with a few uni's... 1. Iron Man Endgame Uni... I don't know what benefit I will get in buying this uni (?)... 2. Immortal Hulk Uni... (+World War Hulk uni)... I can use hulk in two ABX days: Combat Hero and Combat Villain... 3. Red Guardian Uni... Like Hulk I can use Red Guardian in two ABX days: Comabt Hero and Combat Villain... 4. Endgame Cap Uni... I kinda think this is a dumb move... but I can use Cap in two ABX days Blast Villain and Combat Hero... 5. Taskmaster... Well he's a good support... but I honestly I don't think it's good to spend 1050 crystals for a support uni... might be good for BF sale... You can suggest uni's for other characters too...

    <TEXT>How is it overrated??? I don't have any knowledge of other better premium/freemium cards and how to get those (?).. that's why I am banking on the Loki card... I considered buying a deluxe pack but I don't think I really need it right now... 6600 crystals for 1 character and a place to farm resources for me it's not that worth it... (P.S: From what I know those resources you can get from the deluxe pack mission can be farmed somewhere else)... I might buy a deluxe pack when the time comes... I have the capacity to build Jean Grey or the other native T2's so that I can get them... Legendary Battle packs are good though.. All of this are just my opinion and views... you can disregard it if you want to... :)</TEXT>

I was actually finding an all attack card... since I think I can get over 30% Ignore Defense and Skill Cooldown with the Loki 1 card and thinking to replace my Starlord card with a better all attack card... The reason I was finding an all attack card is that I found out why I can't score that much in ABX... I only have 7.5% all attack... I was told that to have better results in ABX I need atleast 20% All attack... hence I'm scouting a better All attack card... BTW, Where to find those cards that you suggest???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people recommend the GotG pack for it's resources... and I also have an 82% progress on the GotG epic quest... maybe that's why I prefer it than the Jean Pack... About the native T2'... I'm afraid the capacity of my resources might not be able to rank up either one of them... I think among the native T2's that I have Thanos and Quicksilver are the only valuable... I'll check the resources needed to rank them up and assess if it's ok to rank them up or not...

I have 9900 BAM, 2000 CNS, 73M gold and 5100 bios... Should I rank and build him up??? Or is it too early for me to focus on Native T2's??? Also, How strong is Quicksilver in the Meta???

Now, I need your help to decide which is the best choice: A. Hela, Starlord, Hydra Cap, Endgame Cap, Taskmaster B. Hela, Starlord, Hydra Cap, Endgame Cap, Immortal Hulk C. Hela, Starlord, Hydra Cap, Taskmaster, Immortal Hulk D. Hela, Starlord, Endgame Cap, Taskmaster, Immortal Hulk</TEXT>

    <TEXT>P.S: If you're curious as to what my reason in buying so much uniforms in the next all uni sale... For me buying these uniforms will increase the usability of my current characters and I can use them in different game modes... While buying the GotG deluxe pack will give me great place to farm resources but Nova is the downside of the pack... 1 character for 6600 crytals that can clear 1 WBU boss, shadowland clear and I don't know if I'll have a use for him on TLB since I already have Widow and Sharog can sometimes kill Jean, Apoc, Thanos with right timing... I avoid teams with Surfer on it... I just don't know how to kill that bastard...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I understand the concept of damage proc... but it seems like I have more to learn... I only have a few characters that have a damage proc on them and I'm practicing with them... but most of the times I mess up...(I did score 300k in ABX with CGR though... I can only score 100k with him before)... How do you time or trigger the proc properly??? Before I thought you need to use some skill first and then when the icon lits up and starts the 5 sec countdown you switch with the skill that have a high damage... Because of this I cancel a skill early or mess up my rotation... After watching Cynicalex video for the second time... it seems like it doesn't work that way... From what I understand it can trigger before or during the second or first skill you use and you just let it play out... I don't know if my understanding is right... What's the difference in procing between obelisk with a normal damage proc, Energy, Rage and other CTP's??? How do you use them properly??? How can you be efficient in following a skill rotation??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I was wondering whether I should slowly start building characters for the new shadowland floors??? Or is it still early to think of those stages??? With that in mind... I'm thinking of replacing taskmaster uni with spidey's uni... Also, collecting and saving Human Torch's bios first than the likes of Hydroman, Molten Man and Korath... what do you think??? Pro's: I'll have +1 floor clearer since I can't use spidey right now .. his uni might help even though he's still at T1... Con's: It might take a long time (until BF sale) to get tasky's uni and miss out on a great support... I need your advice and help me decide on this one (?)... P.S: I was able reach floor 22 last week... I haven't played this week... Might be the same this week (if I don't blunder some floor like last week might be more)... since it' still a few days or a week before the all uni sale and buy Hela and Hulk's uni-+2 floors (with Hydra Cap uni that's +3 villains)...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just woke up and thought of some outrageous ideas... I think of sharing this here and get your opinions...  #8226;I have Rogue at T1 6/6/60 with 370+ bios... I can use this to upgrade her gears and use a regular T2... I also have Cyclops at 5 *... I can use the 6 * RUT that I got from the future pass and (here comes something outrageous) use the MT2 to get him at T2... (P.S: I know I can farm them but I'm a kind of person if you can do it now do it.. ) Doing this can help in my plan of slowly getting Jean Grey... I can use Rogue in Squad Battle (Gold League) female mutant... I can use Cyclops for his leadership and I'm sure he has other use... Doing also this can make me spend so much crystals (6000 at most) in buying uniforms (Hela, Starlord, Hydra Cap, Immortal Hulk, P5 Cyc, Uncanny Rogue)... Or sacrifice getting a CTPE and buy only 5 uniforms (Starlord, Hydra Cap, Immortal Hulk, P5 Cyc, Uncanny Rogue)  #8226;On the other hand I kinda decided last night to just buy Hela, Starlord, Hydra Cap and Immortal Hulk uni and save Tasky's uni for BF sale... this way I can save some crystals in case there's a uni that I might want to buy immediately... (here's to hoping Thor might get the same update like hulk...) Or I can just go with my original plan of buying Hela, Starlord, Hydra Cap, Immortal Hulk and Taskmaster uni... Just want to know your thoughts, oppinions and suggestions... this are just ideas... I can dismiss it anytime... no need to worry...</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226;I need some favor... Can someone check and assess my current build for Sharog, BW, Luna, Starlord, Hulk and Cap??? (This is also the same order of my T3 plan) How should I fix and improve their build??? P.S: I know some of them have messy uru's... I put those when I quite don't understand the game... except for Hulk, I know that he scales off his attack from HP so I put the best HP uru and OB I have... Widow also have a patience on her... but that's because she became too soft in timeline battle with an Ignore Dodge + 140% Damage Proc obelisk... so I thought the 5 sec. Invincibility can help me...  #8226;When do you think will be the right time to start building double cost native T2's??? I'm always tempted to build them and suffer the consequence of draining my resources... but I always control myself not to do it and ignore those native T2's...

    <TEXT>It depends whether you have patience to force close their missions to get their bios... or you want to just rank them up fast... I use a 6* Mega Rank Up ticket on Colossus early in the game... I still don't know the huge importance of of the MRUT then... I kinda regret it since it's the only 6* MRUT I got until now... However, on the bright side... I can finish the X-force epic quest in the next few days without Colossus being a huge roadblock... I also plan to buy with crystals Phyla bios to get her to 3* and use a 4* - 6* Rank Up tickets on her... P.S: I'm not saying you should do this... it's up to you and how you want to manage your resources... I just want to share my experience and plans... :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226;Just curious... What's your opinion about Spider Man and Ant Man??? Base on what I know... most people will rank them lower among the Tier 3 (along with Black Panther)... I have them at T1 and thinking to advance them to T2... I feel like I've been neglecting them ever since I get them to T1 6/6/60... I didn't pay attention to them since most people will say they are not that good... I want to know what's your opinion about them... Are they really that weak??? Do they have some use??? In what game mode/s will they be useful??? Is it worth it to buy their uniform??? Are their T3 really that underwhelming??? I may have a wrong impression about them... because of what I read in all forums and medias related to MFF...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A second custom gear slot will be good... but in my opinion a second gear slot is not needed as long as the cost of unequiping a custom gear is free or gold cost (around 50,000-100,000)...

    <TEXT>I've been keeping these cards: [3 Good Cards ](http://imgur.com/gallery/VruHtBJ) for the past few days... I'm thinking to replace my current cards (Avengers, Starlord and War of Realms) with these cards.. What do you think... is it a good idea??? I know Punisher and Civil War 5 cards have good random options... but the Bishop card only have 1 good random option which is scd... I'm hesitating whether to reroll it or not and keep the scd... I have 2 6* spare cards that can be use to reroll... I'm in dilemma whether to use this to reroll the Bishop card or my Loki P-card since it has an awful random option (?)... If my math is right I will lose atleast 5% Max HP but my All Attack, IgD and SCD will go up to 20% and 30%... if I equip these cards as it is... What do you think guys??? Need your opinion and advice on this one... IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

Loki #2 is the P-card right??? I'm confuse with the 2 Loki cards... Edit: Oh... I kinda get it now... hahaha... what random stats should I aim for the Loki#2 card???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I may ask you, kindly apply those percentages to actual numbers/cost... so that I can have a much better grasp on data... It's hard for me to imagine how much will actually be save just base on percentage... This is base on what I know and if my cost estimate is right... Doing 100% method will cost you 7,500,000 gold: Level 2 Potential (61-62)  gt; 500,000 gold Level 3 Potential (63-64)  gt; 1,000,000 gold Level 4 Potential (65-66)  gt; 1,500,000 gold Level 5 Potential (67-68)  gt; 2,000,000 gold Level 6 Potential (69-70)  gt; 2,500,000 gold Note that this is a fixed amount... yes, you can get it one try doing the 10% method... but what are the odds of doing it in one try for all 5 levels and doing it 10-20+ times in all 5 levels??? The downside of doing 100% method is you will really burn a huge amount of resources... if my estimate is right it will cost around 8,000-10,000 BAM or CNS... but let's say you have 10,000 BAM and 10,000 CNS... if you use 50-50 or alternate them... the cost/lost might still be acceptable...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably you can maintain being in top 20% of gold league or 2%-10% if you played really well... Using a Level 60 toon might give you a headache especially if you go up against T3 Jean and Thanos (TLB is overpopulated by this 2 characters)... Stay away from Surfer... I think CM needs a GBI + Damage Proc more than a GBI + 4 sec. Invincibility... especially she's still Level 60... You should finish building Widow so that she can give you better results... she only have 1 ISO on her... I don't think that will help her... I think you're using her in TLB with her hands tied behind her back... And for me Widow is much better than CM (I think I read some player say CM needs Destruction so that she will be really good in timeline)... I have T3 Widow with a Crit Damage + 180% Damage Proc... and I'm doing ok... I was able to stay in the safe zone last week in Vibranium...</TEXT>

It doesn't affect them that much... their just way too quick than everyone else... So, they probably think there's no point in complaining and mind their own business... In this way they will not ruin their business partnership with RP... and they will also benefit from RP having a good car that can get ahead or challenge or impede their rivals...

    <TEXT> #8226;Since maintenance is still on going... I don't have anything to do... so I came with a couple of question: A. What is the estimated cost to build each character: Jean, SS and Odin (1 * - 6 * + Mastery, Lvl. 1 - 60, Lvl. 61 - 70, T3)??? How long does it take to farm those resources??? B. I only have CGR for fire damage and Colossus with P5 uni for Phoenix Force... Can they clear Shadowland Floor 33 and 34 at Lvl. 62 or 64??? Or they need to be at Level 70??? P.S: I actually use Sharog on Floor 32 since I don't have a good Spider Sense character... and I don't want to build Spidey... Can a High DPS character clear floor 33 and 34??? Cause I heard that if you use emma on floor 34 and use her skill with summon and those summon don't have phoenix force... her damage gets reduce (I think)... So I wonder if it will be the same if you use a character with high dps on floor 33 and 34???</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226;Since my last post have so much rumblings... I'll keep my question simple... A. Should I build Red Skull or Doctor Octopus to Level 70??? (Sole purpose is the free gear upgrade and I don't plan to awaken them anytime soon)... B. Or Should I Level up my Colossus to 70??? (I'm near the cap and I need him for the floor 34 of shadowland since he's my only Phoenix Force character) C. I only need a 4 * and 5 * RUT to finish the GotG epic quest... I'm waiting the 14 day token event so that I can get a 4 * and 5 * RUT... This is the reason why I can't take advantage of the free upgrades for BRB... By the time I finish the EQ it might be a few days before the next update... and unlocking his potential might take some time... Is there any other way I can get a 4 * and 5 * RUT??? If I can get a 4 * and 5 * RUT I can finish the epic quest immediately... and start unlocking BRB's potential... and I migh be able to take advantage of the free gear upgrades... What do you think??? I need your opinions and suggestions... IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who sees this... correct me if I'm wrong... From what I know damage procs only apply on one skill for 5 sec... so once you cancel a skill and the proc triggers on that skill it will cut off... it won't be transfered to another skill... This is why I think CTP of Rage is the most recommended on almost all characters... especially those with complicated rotation or long skill duration... since when it procs the proc carry over to another skill...</TEXT>

How do you decide on which character you will build???  #8226;I'm still working on finishing the GotG epic quest... and that update was released 2 months ago... Now, I'm confuse on which character I should T3 next (Hulk, Blackbolt, possibly Storm)... Then, I'm slowly working on building Surfer (it will probably take months for me to finish)... with different things going on I'm losing my focus on what I should really do... (I decided not to pay attention with the on going free gear upgrades for Awakening characters... it's just too much for me to handle...) I wonder how do you manage your resources??? And how do you decide which character you will prioritize first???</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226;What's the best stategy in building SS??? Slow progress (like combining 3 bam per day and slowly ranking and leveling him)??? Or Hoarding all resources and then dumping it on him all at once??? What's the average time to build him from 1 * to T2 6/6/60 to Lv. 61 - 70 to T3???  #8226;Is it still worth it to T2 Black Bolt and buy his uni... even though he will stay at Lv. 64 or 70 for a while??? I saw some videos of him and I know that he will only shine with his T3... I wonder if he still have a good value at T2...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, Looks like I'm getting distracted with those shiny DPS characters... With regards to lead and supports... It also takes time to get enough bios to take them to t2... I have 600+ bios of shuri... After I clear shadowland this week I'll use the 375 on her... so that I'll finish getting her to T2... Next will be Voodoo since I got lucky getting him at 5* and only need 600+ bios to get him to T2... and that's 2 weeks worth of shadowland... A1 farming can only get me 10 bios per day same with Beast and she hulk... I'm also planning to buy Taskmaster uni, White Fox and Nick Fury...  #8226;Using this Basic Questions Thread probably is a bad thing... since I kept on asking what ever question I have in mind... No worries I'll stay away from this sub from now on... :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After being in this sub for a few months I learn the most basic things about the game... and understand how the game works... Probably the reason why I ask so many questions is that I lack independence when it comes to decision making and need to listen to others advice... before coming into a conclusion... And with so many things going on I get confuse on what should be my goal... Well, thanks to the both of you... I realize that... and probably try to be more independent and set clear goals... P.S: Heard that NF (not necessarily the uni) is the best if not one of the best support for heroes in the game... that's why I'm considering buying him... but thanks for telling me that NF and WF are endgame goals so that's out of the equation now... Well, Voodoo is a good lead... so I fee like I should just T2 him to make him better...</TEXT>

I might save some mats if I use it on her... P.S: I level up Deadpool a few days ago since I planned to T3 him next... but opinions from discord discourages me... and told me to just wait by november or december... I'm just curious is Deadpool really not good even at T3 + the Lady Deadpool uni??? There's a big disparity between LDP and HLDP???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I need your opinions and suggestions... I will buy Taskmaster uni... I can add 1 or 2 more uni's... but it will be the character that I will focus on this month... So which is the best choice?: Awaken Medusa, T3 Deadpool, T3 BB, T3 CapA (?), T3 Storm (?), T3 QS, Lv.70 Cable... You can suggest anyone... Note: My main goal is to build Odin... I'm waiting for the BF sale to do this... SS is the next best choice... but he will set back my resources big time for Odin... and I'm not that interested in PvP anymore... Just doing it for bonus crystals per week since I buy Stark Stash monthly... [Roster Screenshot ](http://imgur.com/a/HG8qrE4) IGN: Vincent 037</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dormammu appears in Damnation... From what I know Mephisto tricked Dormammu, Shuma-Gorath and Blackheart which trapped them in a dimension... hence why Mephisto is the one who rules the Hotel Inferno... There's one point in the story where DS allies himself with Dormammu to get out of the dimension and seek revenge agains't Mephisto but later on DS betrayed him... But I agree with you that they don't follow their theme with the mid month update... during the Hulk's update we got Odin as the mid month T3... there's still a possibility that the mid month is a different character not related to the theme of the update...</TEXT>

That player will want to have Blade... and will definitely fall for this offer by NM... if he/she doesn't know that Blade is an easy character to farm... and he/she doesn't need to waste crystals... to get his/her favorite character... Hence, this is why I see this as shady and a scheme by NM... to take advantage of those kind of players...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have a point... but that doesn't changed the fact that the main intention of NM in offering those... is to capitalize on the ignorance of new players and/or players who don't know the ease of farming those characters... No wonder you are called a "douche" by @Quantus22... You are quick to judged me in this statement of yours:  gt;Your problem is that you assume everyone is an idiot who can be taken advantage of. When in fact I never see them that way or called them that... Yeah, I use the word ignorant in this comment... but being ignorant is different from being an idiot... Ignorance means lack of knowledge not capabilty... and you can make mistake if you don't know something... while being an idiot means lack of intellectual capability... An ignorant person can always seek additional knowledge to become less ignorant, but, as the saying goes, you can #8217;t fix an idiot...  gt;I assume people are smart enough to spend their money wisely. Good for you then... but I assume not all people are smart and some people need other people's help to stop them from making a mistake... Did you forget that this sub have a 'Basic Question Thread'???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The game will always have many paywall stuff... that's how they make money from the game... They introduce a lot of new characters (ex. Beta Ray Bill, Thane, Red She Hulk, Dazzler, Scarlet Spider) and character reworks (ex. Odin, Blackbolt, Medusa, Dormammu)... They gave a face makeover to ABX and added some mechanics... (we're still protesting to improve rewards)... Last, they added new modes and a bit better rewards on story mode... and introduce Danger Room Extreme, which makes DR more fun... P.S: I just list some notable things that the devs did this year and I don't know what's your criteria to make the game worth it to get back to... But I think you need to try to play again and see if you will have fun on playing it again...</TEXT>
