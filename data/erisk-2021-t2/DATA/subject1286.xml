    <TEXT>I went through something similar and all I can advise you is to not cling to your anxiety, I've learned that if you let go and challenge it it's going to suck for a little and then it's smooth sailing. The more you grip your fears the more you are controlled by it. It will take some time but challenge it, make yourself uncomfortable, because believe me there is light at the end of the tunnel. I feel your pain and I sympathise with you, but believe me it gets worse before it gets better, however the end results are remarkable. Be free and don't let your fears and anxiety control you. If you need someone to talk to feel free to shoot us a pm</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-09 00:50:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi gents and ladies Thought one of you gurus could help me. Changed the coils in my Sapor yesterday to .55 claptons. It's really nice and such but they're coming up very very late. Takes two puffs to get it going. Just wondering what am I doing wrong? I'm using a joytech mini for it. Not sure if it's the mod however I tried it on a bigger mod last night (double battery mod) and it did the same thing. Could someone throw me some guidance to what's happening to it? Thanks heaps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey myman/girl Some advice purely from my perspective is to continue your practice, I have come from a similar backround and well it too felt like that for me to begin with, but I kept going and I still do everyday no matter how the meditation is, no judgement I just do what I need to do and look for no result. It was hard for me not to attach myself to a goal but slowly I have let go of it. Emotions and thoughts are passing, like weather, they are not here to stay and you will see that. Therapist may help, it has for me in the past for my anxiety which Iam not 100% cured of however, its helped me talk it out and understand where it comes from, root of problems etc. From my perspective once I started seeking answers for myself everything makes sense, be patient and have compassion for yourself and yeah reach out were all here to support. If you need anything else, throw me a PM happy to give you advice or just a friend to talk to. Cheers</TEXT>

Experience in time with meditation your mind will settle and youll find what you seek, but its not a goal. We are capable of all we wish to accomplish but when we force things it never pans to anywhere good. Let it be, observe and proceed. Shoot me a pm if you want some more help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This happens to me sometimes Ill be very honest. What I can do even if i dont follow through right there and then is understand that it isa figment of my ego trying to deteriorate something else. Now the way my mind works is that it tries to see things wrong and pick and them, etc. in my wisdom i know this is just monkey mind, watch it, listen to it, be nice to yourself because its very hard to get over that like of believing your thoughts and under standing that its just a pattern. The best thing you can do is face it, realise its just echoes of your ego and breathe it out. How long can it last? It wont. Hope this helps</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Daily meditation - looking to see how everyone does theirs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-08 08:19:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Horde, Ive completed about 6-7 months of study on meditation and I have finished the course Iam doing. Iam now establishing a daily routine and I just wanted to see how everyone else does theirs, Im not looking for a right or wrong answer, just curious to see how you seasoned gurus go about your day. At the moment Im doing 40 mins in the morning, 5 min break during the day, 30 mins at night + 5 minutes before I go to bed. Im not going to say its 'working' as I feel thats a bit goal driven black and white statement, Im going to say this facilitates my personality well. How do you guys go about your meditation times? Also just wondering, who sits? (cross legged or uncrossed  amp; why?) Who Sits on a chair or bench? Thanks in advance, I normally lurk and give points, thought its time to post. Thanks for reading - B</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Vmware and MacOSX specifically to run LogicX</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-26 20:13:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Guys, Just wanted to ask you gurus something as I do not know or have the experience, I thought id come here and pick your brains. I need to run LogicX, which is OS X only, so friend of mine suggested I run it through Vmware. Could this run smoothly and allow hardware to work IE Soundcard? I have no experience in this side of things, I used to own a mac now I do not anymore and the price of one is ridiculous to buy again. Hence why I swapped to windows but unfortunately I seem to be stuck in logic x pro for making music. Other option is to go the hackingtosh way with the current build I have. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks subject1286</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guys Quick question. This is a laptop question however Im asking in regards to Thermal Paste. This is coming from a PC builder which has recommended this. I wanted a second opinion. I have a Acer Predator Helios 300 with a 7700hq / GTX 10606g / 16GB ram etc. I use it daily for Autocad / Gaming. Sometimes I stream from it also. Machine gets used to its full capabilities. Laptop was needed due to alot of travel so I could not opt for a PC build. Upon buying the laptop I was recommended that I replace the CPU/GPU paste round 6 month mark with a Liquid Metal to help cooling temps. Its getting a little warm outside so my ramp temps have been a little higher than normal which is well expected. I also run a .120MW undervolt on the cpu to keep the temps better than factory. My concern is this - Do I replace the factory paste for a better one? Will it help temps that much? PC builder swore by it. I want to prolong the health of this laptop as long as possible. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated and Im sorry if this is the wrong section this just seemed like the best place to post without having my topic locked / deleted due to it being a laptop related question. I know there is a sub for laptops but ........ I think this sub is more appropriate for my type of question. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Guys, Firstly let me start off by thanking anyone for input. I work remotely to my server in Australia, I connect via Mobile VPN client with SSL to access the network drives and do my work. My IT guy seems to not be doing anything about it or maybe even have a single damn clue and were all complaining. I have a 1000/500 mbs connection here where i work and at the physical server where I connect I have 100/100. Since a couple of days my upload to the server and download has been dramatically slow and I cant pin point why, its never been fast but it has been bearable for me to work on. Im not sure what to say to this guy or have him look at as he seems pretty potato and im trying to take matters into my own hands. Can anyone point me in the right direction or give me some advice? IM happy to commission someone who knows what they are doing. Cheers.</TEXT>

If if upgrade my hdds and ram config will it be a problem for warranty? What limits is there to power on these machines? 30/50/60w? What kind of temps are you guys seeing under load at .125mv and so on? Im australian, currently living in europe and im trying to find out if the XMG is the best option for me!  #8203; Also.. cheeky question are you guys having black friday sales? hehe :)  #8203; Thanks in advance mate</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Tom thanks alot mate. I ask the thermal paste question due to alot of manufacturers applying less than poor paste. I like lm and I've had it on a couple configs this is why I'm asking. However a satisfactory mx4 is also great. I would be insanely greatful for a good paste. So doesn't hurt to ask. Do you by chance have photos of the cooling systems in both 2060/2070 configs? Are c states tweaked or left standard? I saw this on my last clevo and it was very good. I think it might be a better idea for me to start posting in the notebook chat thread even though I don't speak English it's quite an enjoyable thread! I like cool(cold) gaming laptops this is why I ask alot of questions, better safe than sorry right mate?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi Tom, Thats great thanks for the replies, Ive seen some stuff about the C-states as my PA70 always ran at 10w even in idle and the XMG somewhere on the megathread ive seen people mention it. - never hurts to ask! Are the units pre assembled or do you guys assemble them? Idealy I put laptops through hell, its for engineering / gaming (sometimes). I mean when I push through it 70+ loads alot of the day I want to make sure the cooling is adequate, I beg to differ about manufacturers applying thermal paste badly, I can pm you some subjects as I do not want to go into it publicly. Im seeing some cool reviews (2 of them so far) of the XMG 17 (clevo equivalent evoc in the states). Which Im liking so far. I thought more of the guys would have gone into tweaking and hard benching in the threads but it seems its just childsplay for most! hehe.</TEXT>

I'd follow some guides in order to undervolt your gpu also to not hurt it in terms of performance and just take out some heat/voltage .

    <TEXT>Alright I was in the same position as you and to be honest I couldnt stomach the small gains between those two cards, decided for a mobile workstation I wanted a full P card. Went the XMG PRO 17. So if youre worried about temps id be looking to my screenshot attached and Ill let that do the talking. : [https://imgur.com/a/KUMl1oL](https://imgur.com/a/KUMl1oL)  #8203; So this is in stock form, I havent had time to get into ridiclous OC yet, however this should push alot more as thermal headroom is HUGE.  #8203; If you cannot justify the jump for a MQ then I would be able to justify it for a full power card.  #8203; I was on the bench about a fusion and a XMGPRO17, I regret nothing about going the full 2070 card.  #8203; Youre not going to be able to get an extremely small machine that will have great thermal headroom (laws of thermodynamics), the fusion isnt bad at all, its quite inpressive in its class and its probably the coolest running laptops, however Id thing to the size of it thats why it has thermal implications.  #8203;  #8203; Go the XMGPRO17 for the same price!

    <TITLE>Problems with downclocking - workaround</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-22 19:04:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have been bugging out with my cores not clocking down or speed shifting as they should. Today I did a workaround and lowered sst/speed shift values on ts and would you know it starts doing it properly. Did this with throttlestop - my initial value was 64. And straight away my power consumption dropped and it stopped locking to max frequency. Tested this on all profiles on the clevo center and and the culprit is a high sstvalue in the actual program clevo center. For those of you getting bad battery life etc this may be a better solution for you. I managed to get about 3.5-4 hours out of my xmg pro 17 after that. So quite a good improvement! Tom when you have a moment perhaps we can pass on this info to clevo, might be a problem for others also.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-15 16:44:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I haven't touched games in a couple days. Today decided to fire up again So normally on balanced mode on red dead redemption 2 I get about 75-70 fps it will go to about 1650mhz boosted at about 69c. Launched it today no change in settings, clock locks to 1215mhz and and sub 55fps and lower. The machine doesn't even heat up. I've done a ddu and a fresh driver (twice). And still no luck. My Nvidia inspector says estimated clock 1900mhz. However no matter what I do it just won't boost. Haven't uninstalled it touched registry or modding etc it's very vanilla. Apart from a windows update (done in background automatically) nothing has been touched Any clues at all? Faulty machine or bad driver or something? Driver is fresh and re downloaded just to make sure everything is fine and fresh. Windows install is 3 months old also. It hasn't missed a beat till today Anyway any help would be great</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ram choice, AMD newbie! please be kind!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-20 18:05:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi gents, Ive aquired myself a build which will become a ryzentosh. Purely used for studio and music production work, it will be dual boot with ocasional gaming when a friend comes over, however not its pupose. The system consists of a B450F-Strix  amp; a Ryzen 7 2700, RX580 and other bits and bobs which dont directly perf. So reason Im throwing up this post is this is becuase this is my first AMD in well over 15 years so I dont know what to choose for RAM. There is ridiclous amounts of reviews, videos etc, I just figured a discussion would work better. Basically What ive learned that AMD's like higher clocked ram if im not mistaking. I have found a LPX kit, 2x8gb sticks @ 3200mhz at [CL16@1.35v](mailto:CL16@1.35v). Is this enough to power my ryzen? Do I need to go faster? Do you suggest another Ram brand ie hyper x? I will be updating the CPU in the next year or so, so Id like to somewhat 'futue proof'  lt;-- I know thats a bit stilly but im trying to stay ahead of the curve a little. Please be kind, Its my first time. Thanks in Advance guys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m with the others sitting and commenting here. While your story is compelling and it #8217;s great - I #8217;ve just built a system and picked up a 2700 as I wanted to skip 3000 and opt directly for 4000 when it went live. Oh but why didn #8217;t you just wait? Cause I needed a fucken and it #8217;s none of your business generally. But the decision was made after speaking to a lot of people about board choice (b450). Like many others I don #8217;t feel I got  #8220;enough #8221; out of it. If I had of known like many others the chipset purchase would have been directly a 570 with the same cpu at the time. No big deal to have spent the money then - times change and the economy is now shit, I #8217;m also having to be conscious like many others. However now I need myself a new cpu, mobo and probably different ram as every arch seems to be different with memory modules. Couple others comments about switching to intel and the bottom line is now; why would I go to 4000? Or stay on even this platform? I #8217;d rather sell and move to Intel - it #8217;s the last gen for both for ddr4 anyway and least they #8217;re pretty clear - I #8217;d pay a premium any day for just the bottom line, not a  #8220;clouded vision #8221; of what you may or may not do. Oh and let #8217;s not mention the headaches I #8217;ve had to get the system running to what it #8217;s factory expectations were. Full amd system - I #8217;ll just leave it at that. I #8217;ve never had these issues on Intel. Lots of us built systems on this promise, now if it was 1 or two people who understood the wrong thing call us stupid, but it #8217;s a large portion of the community. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it Robert. I #8217;m the 1%, but eventually you #8217;re gonna piss off a lot more people AMD</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a thought (coming from a RTx 2070 owner in a XMG PRO) - you can customise your fan profiles / boost settings etc to a point where its convenient. On anylaptop for that matter and find yourself a sweetspot.  #8203; I have couple friends with fusions and they think its fine - end of the day its a thin unit and cools decently.  #8203; The RTX for example has a larger die and its very efficient at cooling as opposed to older chips  #8203; Hope this help :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just an update - the screen dims more frequent now. And I have tried a bunch of things over the weekend to try and isolate the problem.  #8203; Ill outline again. #160; 1. I have been having screen flicker issues for a while now, both on my monitors (external 2x27 inch Acer nitros) and dimming/flickering on my laptop panel, this started roughly about 2-3 months ago, however I thought nothing of it as it would happen randomly and then the problem would stop. #160; Recently it has been doing it more in the last 1-2 months, basically what it looks #160;like is the screen goes black and and image flickers, then it tries to find the appropriate resolution, after 4-5 seconds #160;it finds it and continues to work. #160; In the last week of work it has become very annoying and IM loosing time. #160; The laptop panel I noticed around the same time whilst watching a normal video, where it looked like it was flickering / and dimmin the panel. #160; Steps I have done to try and resolve the problem DDU (several times) / Driver reinstall Cable change on monitors (both brand new less than 1.3m long. #160; Ram Swap to another 32gb (costly change) Ram Swap to original ram laptop cam w ith. #160; Re installed OS on 3 different drives (costly change) #160; Os reinstall couple of times. #160; No fix. #160; 2. I have been having boosting issues at times in certain situations and fps drops, again I tweak my windows so that there is nothing going on when I game or render. Basically I see nothing outside of 1000mhz and it wont go up, It suffers from FPS loss. This has happened 7-8 times in the last month. Im not #160;certain here. 3. My soundcard has issues on input, whenever i try to capture audio coming in it basically sounds like it is distorting and shorting, so there is a loud (UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU) sound. #160; I have tried, different cables and re installer drivers many a time with absolutely no luck. #160; All undervolt removed and left as factory stock to prove these, I have ran benchmarks to see if it does flicker / turn on and off and it does this during high synthetic loads also. Performance is constant still, however it has moments where it scores lower than it should. #160; 4. I turn my machine off, and it never turns off fully it keeps the power led on and it never turns off unless I force turn it off. #160; 5. Upon wake  amp; restart it does not detect one of the ssds. a restart fixes this, however annoyoing. #160;  #8203; I lodged ticket / spoke to you Tom just on the verge of warranty running out (6 months).  #8203; This is the updated things I have tried before putting the ticket up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a trick to this whole liquid metal thing and let me explain. Tom you and I have had various words about it and we know what's what. I've had several machines on liquid metal, in which the cooling solution must have enough power and mass in over to cool it, there is no point in one way or another to do it. With a great thermal paste application you rarely need to. Be warned - if your heatsink cannot take the mass heat coming off the heated components the result will be the same as an aging thermal paste job. As liquid metal can be a saviour I've damaged components doing exactly this same thing - LM dropped on mainboard and did not see, caused me to have to take it apart and eventually break some components. Protective barriers help etc but they do not help metal dripping off which is the trick when dismantling I think what's needed more people to learn tunability such as voltages rather than using LM. LM is a last resort if you've tried all else. I say this from a deep enthusiast perspective</TEXT>
