    <TITLE>I'm not sure a Christian therapist is going to do me any good?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-20 12:31:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Background: I was taken advantage of three years ago by my [now] ex boyfriend. I managed to shove it into the back of my mind and vowed never to think about it again, partly because at that time I was blaming myself for not stopping him and partly because when I told a friend, he told me that I probably imagined that because my ex would never do something like that. I'm now in a good relationship, but I've started getting flashbacks when we have sex. Not every time, but often enough that it scares me to have sex even though I have a strong sex drive. My boyfriend is very understanding and is always telling me that he'll stop if I get a flashback and that it's not a problem, but I feel terrible about doing that to him. Now: I finally decided to ask my mom to get me some help with dealing with what happened to me. (I had never told her what happened before, but she knows now.) Anyways, she made me an appointment with a Christian therapist (she doesn't want me to go to anyone who isn't a Christian) but I'm worried that I won't be able to be honest with this therapist because I know that few Christians are okay with sex outside of marriage and that's where my problem is because of the flashbacks. I don't have my own insurance and I can't tell my mom why I'd rather go to a secular therapist because she'd be really upset if she found out I've been having sex. Is it worth attempting to work with this therapist? Because I think my only other option is to just wait until I graduate and get a job with my own health insurance. Edit: Thank you, everyone. Because of various circumstances my mom had to make the appointment rather than me so I haven't had any contact with this therapist yet. I think I'll let my mom know that I only want to start with one appointment and go from there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I say bring flowers. Probably not roses, though. If you go to a flower shop and tell them you want less formal flowers for a first date, they will probably know what flowers are best. (My sister does this type of work and she's told me it a fairly common request.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm gonna feel out this therapist to start with I think. But I'm gonna keep in mind that you're probably right about my mom only being upset for a little while. I'm more concerned about what she'll think mainly cause she's always held me up as the standard to my younger siblings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who has been where your girlfriend has been, the best advice I can give is to go slow. Tell her ahead of time that she can tell you to stop - and you should always be willing to stop. Ask her if she would be more comfortable with the lights on or off. Suggest that she starts on top of you. This gives her more control and, at least for me, is less triggering. Along with letting her know that she can say stop at any time, pay attention to what her body is saying. She may dissociate or grit her teeth and just try to get through it. If either of these happen, gently get her attention and tell her you are willing to stop if she wants to. It sounds as if you do realise that she may not orgasm, which is good to know. It may take a long time before she does. She also may orgasm on the first time. As far as knowing if/when she climaxes, I can't answer those questions yet (as I said, it may be a long time before she climaxes during sex), so I'll let others answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend recently saw cuts on my upper arm and she's been asking me why I did it. I've just been trying to play it off like it's nothing, especially since those are older. She's not fooled, but she's mostly dropped it. The thing is, I trust her, and I kind of want to tell her, but I can't. It took me three hours of sitting with my boyfriend, with him reassuring me, trying to say it to finally get it out so that he would know why I had pushed him away from me when we were only kissing. So basically, I don't think that I would actually be able to say it. DAE feel like this ever? Does anyone have an tips on how to be able to say it? I think she thinks I don't trust her anymore since I just can't tell her and I don't want her to think that. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the ideas. I went to a therapist for this hoping I could cope with flashbacks better. But it was a bad idea because I couldn't say most of what happened which skewed her view and she sometimes tried to pull the story out of me. She wasn't harsh or scary or bad, but it scared me even more and it makes it harder for me to open up because if a trained therapist couldn't help... My friend won't be able to help so why would I burden my friend with my problems? If that makes sense? But I think I might try your idea to call a helpline. It can't really hurt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I obviously don't remember this, but when I was two, my family lived in Colombia and we were having a picnic with the church we were a part of. I guess I wandered off while my mom's back was turned and somehow ended up in the nearby lake. One of the guys from a nearby village was walking in the water and accidentally kicked me, and ended up pulling me out of the water. (Which apparently is amazing in itself since this man was very afraid of water spirits.) Anyways, I guess I was unconscious for a while and they almost flew me to a hospital, but I woke up before the plane was ready and the doctor there said I was fine. When my mom asked me what happened the next day, I guess I told her that a man was with me and told me to just swallow the water. And based on the amount that my mom said I peed out that night, I guess I listened. They also think I was under water for at least two maybe three minutes. Tl;dr: Almost drowned when I was two but apparently swallowed the water instead of breathing it in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I told my mom over the phone since I was in a different country. I told her beforehand that she was not allowed to ask any questions - I just needed her to make me an appointment to talk to someone when I got home. She pretty much asked if I was serious and then asked if I was okay. (To clarify, she wasn't questioning me, I think she was in shock a bit.) I'm sure she's told my dad but I haven't talked to him about it. I met my current SO after. Once I finally told him, he held me while I cried. He told me at some point, then or later, I don't remember, that he guessed based on some of my previous reactions to things. He handles things really well. Edit: It was 3 years after it happened that I told my mom because my current SO encouraged me to talk to someone about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best thing? Probably that though a company looks like it's running smoothly, there's probably a lot of internal conflict. Along with that, I learned some good ways to work with people despite the conflict. Most important thing I learned though is that I didn't want to do that line of work exactly. Still that field, different client base. Edit: Took out a word for clarity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Running. Unfortunately it's hard to get started with running when you're depressed. I started because my mom wanted someone to walk with. Then I got a dog who wanted to run rather than walk. Gradually I got to running and I did feel better. And then I overloaded myself with work and school and barely had time to sleep, so running was out. Don't let yourself do this. The depression hit me even harder and I could hardly handle it. But I'm slowly beginning to run again now since I have time and I can feel the difference again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think of a balloon. As air gets blown into it, it grows. If it gets too much air, it will pop (explode almost). But if you poke a small hole near the base of the balloon where the air is entering, the air had someplace to escape without popping the balloon. For me, I felt, and sometimes still feel, like that balloon. The air is all the stress and anxiety and fears and pain I feel. In order to relieve myself before I explode like that balloon, I would cut in order to relieve the pressure before I explode. But it hurts. And it's scary sometimes.. Especially when people see and ask about it. At least it shows they care and would rather ask than blatantly stare.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Orgasm but doesn't feel good?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-27 00:04:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi. I've been sexually active for eight months now with my fianc #233;. At first I couldn't orgasm at all. Not with him, not on my own. For the past 4 or 5 months, I think I've been having orgasms (or at least my body is reacting the way I've read our bodies react during an orgasm) but I feel nothing. I twitch, I guess I spasm, but I feel no pleasure and no release. In the end, it just feels like it was a lot of work for nothing since I just feel frustrated. Does anyone have any advice to make my brain feel the pleasure I'm supposed to feel? (If it makes a difference, I've orgasmed only once before, 3.5 years ago when I was raped by an ex boyfriend. I like to think that I'm mostly over it, since I don't have very many panic attacks during sex anymore, but I guess it may be a factor.) Thanks for any help or advice you can give me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have somewhat. We discussed the panic attacks more than anything else. I was raised in a Christian home, and the area around me was Christian so sex wasn't a common topic, but between my loving fianc #233; and time, I've been doing a lot better. He even mentioned when I was upset afterwards about having a panic attack during sex, that the time between attacks have been getting longer. It's only been recently that I've been questioning if my twitches have been orgasms since he watched me masturbate recently and said that he's almost certain he saw me orgasm but I felt nothing.</TEXT>

But having said that, I should note that the reason I know what's in those diaries is because he showed me a couple entries in which he wrote his prayers about me.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-09-07 19:55:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>My FMIL and I get along pretty well and have no problems with each other. My dilemma is that she wants to be more involved in wedding planning. I'd like to have her be more involved as well, but I just don't know what to have her do. A little background: My FH and I live close to his family, but my family (and the wedding) is literally 1000 miles away. In all honesty, my sister is doing the majority of the work. She loves planning and weddings. She's organised and understands the little details. I'm more of big picture and so I give get an outline of what I want and she's been doing beautiful work making what I want a reality. (Yes I have the best big sister ever.) So basically, I don't know what to have my FMIL do to help involve her. I sometimes feel like I'm not even a part of the planning (though that works with my personality). How are you involving your FMIL?</TEXT>

Unfortunately we live in a really remote place and dress stores are pretty far away. I had my bridesmaids go as a group (since they're close to where the wedding will be and close to bridal stores) and try some dresses on recently and I think they found a dress they all like that fit my requirements. Did you ask for any input on the reception meal from anyone besides you and your (then) FH? Do you think asking her with help on that might be a viable option? (Edit to the correct meal.)</TEXT>

Yeah. There were bad days, but I actually loved my job for the most part because I had great co-workers (usually anyways). I guess my advice is: If possible, ask friends about part time jobs they have. Do they like the work atmosphere? Try there. Is there a store/restaurant you enjoy going to because the employees seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs? It might be worth applying at those places.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would also argue that slavery would be a lot more common and people wouldn't have beauty as many objections to the practice. After all, many people once believed that black people were of another species. While that was partially a justification white people made for enslaving them, there were many who really believed that black people and white people were two different species. And as such, one dominated and enslaved the other with the superior technology that others have already mentioned.</TEXT>

I was pushed into going to the first one, and I felt uncomfortable with the second one but it was the only one my mom felt comfortable with me going to. (I was still on my parents insurance.) I've tried talking to him. He encourages me to talk to him. But I can never form the words. If I get close to talking about it, I start downplaying everything like it's not really a big deal. The only times I've ever been able to talk about these things openly without holding back is when I got extremely drunk. And I never want to get to that point again. I'm honestly so thankful that he still loves me despite my problems (and he says that he knew something was wrong not long after he met me since he saw my scars). Sorry. I'm just rambling now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing too terrible but I once accidentally texted a male friend (who I also worked with) a text meant for my boyfriend that strongly that I couldn't wait for him to visit and strongly implied that BDSM type activities were going to occur. He was with other male friends of his and read it out loud. I hung out with him and those friends a week later and they all started asking me how my weekend was and kept saying that they never realized that a quiet girl like me would be into that sort of thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, this was the straw that broke the camels back. When I finally opened up about being raped by an ex boyfriend, I mostly told Christians because that was my culture at the time. Most of the responses from Christians were that either God had a reason or that I must have been living wrong and invited it. If God had a reason for that to happen to me, I have no interest in worshipping or following him. When I told my atheist fianc #233; (who I met a few years later), he was nothing but comforting. He had been the most helpful on my path to healing. I also told an atheist friend what happened during a really bad night, he also was pissed as hell about it and never blamed me. There were some Christians who didn't blame me but the majority that I told/found out did, so I decided I didn't want any part of it.</TEXT>

I got pissed at my parents because they rewarded my little sister for doing well in school since she struggled. I, on the other hand, did naturally well and began to think that being naturally good at school was stupid because it meant that I was expected to do well with no reward. And yes, I tried once to start doing not so well so they could "encourage" me to do better as well - but I ended up just getting a lecture about how they knew I could do better and they were disappointed in me.</TEXT>

After I broke up with him for unrelated reasons, I found out that he got engaged two months before we broke up. Don't know how long they'd been dating before that. At the same time, I understand if someone doesn't want to rush into labels too fast. But labels are good for helping both parties know where they stand.</TEXT>

Since the wedding is in early April (and later in the evening), I decided to go with long dressed and purple and silver colours in consideration of trying to keep my bridesmaids somewhat warm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow. Now I really feel like I should be able to find time if you're able to do it while in grad school. I haven't done any grad school yet but I've heard how time consuming it is. I sometimes get weekends off. But it just depends whether or not they need me on certain days. For example: This week I have Friday and Saturday off, but I tend to use my days off to adjust to the next schedule change. Meaning I work until 7am this Thursday (but counts on the schedule as Wednesday) so they also have me scheduled to come back in at 3pm on Thursday and work til 11. So I use my days off to get rest and chores done while also readjusting my body back to working 11pm to 7am since it'll start again Sunday night. That sounds ranty, but my point is that I'm having trouble learning how/when to exercise when my body is constantly adjusting to new work schedules without stressing it too much if that makes sense. P.s. Good luck with your grad studies. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, undergrad gave me a lot of experience with sleep deprivation, so I have that in my favour. I usually sleep about four hours when I get home in the morning, and then maybe two hours before I get up to get ready. Though if I have regular day hours, I tend to get 8-9 hours of sleep straight. Originally I was going right before work, which works sometimes, but I've found that I prefer exercising in the evenings when the gym is empty (small community gym). I consider switching to a regular shift almost constantly, but the difference in pay doesn't allow it until my fianc #233;'s work picks up again in the spring. I want to ultimately lose weight to get to a healthy weight. I told the person that I used to work out with in college that I wanted to run a marathon before I turn 25.

I got lucky because my sister went to trade school for landscaping and had to take floral arranging classes too. One last thing, for that amount I'm getting enough flowers for my bouquet, five bridesmaids, one Jr bridesmaid, my flower girl, and for about 12 vases in the sanctuary.</TEXT>

It's been awhile since I've discussed these, but if I recall correctly, Noah's story is more of a way of showing that God has the supreme power and yet he loves his people and his creation and he'll make covenants to protect them.

    <DATE>2016-03-18 14:22:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm on a small budget and I really wanted to get something useful for my ladies so I had my heart set on clutches for them all in their favourite colours. Then I saw the price of clutches so I gave the thought of them up. My fianc #233; and I had already paid a friend of mine who makes wine to make our own personal signature wine (which he's insisted on making for us at cost and refusing payment for his time/expertise) but it still took up a good portion of the budget. Anyways, the important thing is that I figured out how to make my own clutches with the help of some lovely ladies that run a quilting shop in the town I'm living in. I know they would have been made a little more evenly if i commissioned them but I think they still turned out really well and were much less expensive. I'm so excited and I need to show someone. But all the people I'd usually show I have to keep it a secret from and my fianc #233; is proud of me for getting them done and likes them, but I want to show them off a bit. So here's a picture of a few of them. I also made my flower girl one for the grown up part of her gift. Also, please forgive the tape, the glue was still setting. http://i.imgur.com/MRaOjUU.jpg</TEXT>

It's not the order taking that takes time, it's them sitting by the window waiting for their massive order of food. Then other customers behind them get angry and take more time when they finally get to the window and demand to talk to a manager (which also slows down the food making process since they're pulled off the line.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have two jobs. I'm a Behavior Therapist and a Direct Support Professional for kids with autism. It's a great job but I would only recommend it to someone with patience or who is willing to learn it fast. Also only for people who don't gossip. You have to think about everything you say if you talking about your job with others to avoid breach on confidentiality. I make about 12,000 a year which includes what they pay for my gas. (Hoping a higher full time position will open up soon - benefits, ~33,000/year, and use my degree.) Also a cashier at Joann Fabrics. It's a pretty good job, I get yelled at by customers less than I did at Taco Bell. I'd recommend it to people who know about crafting. Make about 7,700/yr at that job.</TEXT>

Tonight is no different. On the bright side, I got news today that a position that I want within the company I work for will be opening up soon. My supervisor told me even though she doesn't want to lose me but knows that's where i really want to be. If I manage to get it, i go from two part time jobs to one full time with benefits and a $6/hr raise (or $8 if we're talking my retail job).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. My psychology professor always explained it saying that a lot of times people don't commit suicide because depression saps the energy required to carry it out. Antidepressants give people energy before it fixes the mood/emotion problem. Hence, energy to kill oneself and little to no positive emotions to counteract the desire to be done with this life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That last part really pissed me off. I'm pretty sure I just got really lucky, but I recently worked with older mentally disabled men and women in group homes and we were given 8 hours of sick pay every month. And it added up. You could have over 500 hours of sick pay before they'd start putting your accumulated sick pay into communal time off (for people who had long illnesses or sometimes pregnancy leave). They rarely hassled employees about using their sick leave unless he or she was an employee who was known for taking time off then being seen in the bar later that night. (which happen with one particular person pretty often.) In the US by the way.</TEXT>

Well I had one smaller house saved that she really loved and I said we can't really do that one because it's too small for us. I started naming the reasons we want a larger house avoiding future baby reasoning when my husband chimed in and said that we need more room if we're going to have a kid running around it. My husband doesn't talk about a future kid pretty much ever unless I bring it up. It gives me some hope that he's closer to being ready.</TEXT>

This is a kid who is almost never affectionate. I work with kids with autism, so it's really surprising to me that he suddenly changed his behavior. Granted his mom had a baby somewhat recently so if he does somehow know I'm pregnant, he knows what the outcome is and I'm pretty sure he loves his little brother. I hope your three year old will be more okay with a new baby once you talk to her about getting to be a big sister.</TEXT>

I worry about it because she has made comments in the past about how she will be my child's aunt because my sisters live too far away to be aunts (cause that's how it works /s). She's also put huge pressure on my husband and I to have kids so that she can play with them, despite knowing that we weren't financially in a position to have kids, and I know for a fact that she will bitch to people if she thinks she's been slighted, but won't talk to the person about it. (Came up several times when she babysat for someone.) She also thinks she can do no wrong. So it's partially a crappy friendship, but also that she tries to take ownership of other people and their things that wants me to not have to tell her ever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair warning: this is going to be a bit of a rant. So I'm 13+3. We announced about a week ago and told this particular friend about a day in advance. Since then I have seen her twice and both times she has touched my stomach. The first time I just stepped back cause it was so unexpected. The second time, before it even happened, I kept making comments about how everything is still just fat cause the uterus hasn't risen above the pelvic bone yet and yet when we were leaving, she touched me again and said "goodnight new friend". Thankfully I already had my husband on board with how much I hate it and he said something about how awkward it is to just be touching my fat. (The original plan was that he keep himself between us so if she goes to touch that he move in front so she ends up getting his stomach but we were in a car so that didn't work.) But besides the touching thing, she has nicknamed our baby. She nicknamed him/her Barbara. I told her no immediately, but she hasn't stopped. So we just keep referring to the baby as Beowulf and ignoring her every time she says Barbara. She also insists that the baby has to be a girl (cause we can decide that you know) despite knowing that husband and I are hoping for/think it's a boy. She's also mad at us because we're refusing to tell anyone, including her, the names we have picked out. She also asked to be an honorary aunt since my sisters aren't living anywhere close (though my family had been looking to move anyways and are talking about moving closer to me). But at least she asked cause before she knew I was pregnant she TOLD me that she was going to be any future babies' aunt cause my sisters were too far away to really be aunts. We're honestly just hoping at this point that she'll get a job in another state (she's actively looking right now) because she really can be a great friend - but we've realised that from afar is best. Sorry about the rant, I just needed to vent to someone else because I'm sure my husband is tired of hearing about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't understand why people feel the need to butt in on baby name conversations like that - though I am happy for you that it at least helped you realise that Dustin had a potential nickname that you didn't like. And I know that a direct approach to get is really the best, but she always seems really hurt whenever I'm direct about things she's done that bother me and she tries to play it like I'm at fault. Also a bit worried that the hormones will make me permanently end this friendship even though I do like her, just more from a distance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it'd be nice if she would at least all so I could tell her that once it's actually a baby there, she can touch when I give her the okay. And I have previously told my husband that I'm done with her and I can't stand her, but he's my voice of reason that usually reminds me of the reasons that we are friends and why it'd be better to just phase out the friendship when she moves rather than just end it. (That sounds awful but I've seen what happens when people cut her out of their lives - she tells everyone she knows how awful that person is and how they were never a good friend and will tell any secrets they told her.)</TEXT>

I stopped telling her anything that I wouldn't want people knowing about me the first time I realised that, but she still knows a lot. And yeah, I suppose I could use the honorary aunt thing to try to put her behavior on extinction. I think I'm going to give that a try if she continues to ignore when I tell her to stop.</TEXT>

And yeah, I get what you're saying about it being note peaceful without them being there and over excited. I'm pretty sure I'm the first pregnant person my friend has ever had experience bring close to. So I'm also trying to remind myself that her only social script to play on is from movies - where all anyone every talks about is the baby and everyone touches the bump and forgets that the mother is still a human being. So I kinda wonder if that's why it's so hard to achieve a balance unless they've already had a lot of experience around pregnant women.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You do have a point as far as why did we announce. Well, I moved a lot as a kid and as an adult, but I still have friendships that while it would be weird to call/text out of the blue to let them know, we all enjoy keeping up with each other on Facebook - hence announcing. Also cause relatives that I don't want to talk to can find out on there. Hell, I'll talk about gender, no biggie, but I refuse to tell her names because I know too many people who have had people pissed at them for "stealing" names or have had people criticise the name to the point where the parents hate it even though they loved it for a long time before that. And I expect nothing from her when it comes to baby care or gifts. For fucks sake - I plan on being alone with my baby and my husband for as long as I can keep people away (except my immediate family cause they stay out from under my feet and don't expect me to wait on them hand and foot like most people.) And I've been responding to other people on here with the reason she's not already out of my life... So yeah.</TEXT>

Of course, my husband and I are looking to buy a house which will help. The worst part is, I really do enjoy spending time with her sometimes, it's just that I need so much time to prepare myself and then time to decompress after because I'm always on my guard around her even when we're just hanging out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's said a lot that there really is no good time to have a baby. Most people can always be more financially stable, their careers can always be further along etc. I decided I was ready long before my husband was mostly because I realised that I was putting off the decision to have kids based on things that weren't happening. I had wanted to get my masters first, but I was waiting until I was at my job long enough to ask them to help (since they do that sometimes) and I recently learned that they're going through a period of change and they're unlikely to do any assistance for a while. There were other things too, but this is getting long. My point is, I was ready when my husband became emotionally ready to have a kid because I realised that there is a lot outside of my control and if I waited until everything seemed to be ready - I would probably still have several years of waiting ahead of me where I wasn't really doing much to step towards my goals (except saving). The final reason I decided I was ready was because I realised that I can still be a kick ass mom while continuing to pursue my goals when the time is right to pursue them further.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your post was one of the ones I was thinking about, but couldn't find, when I made this post. My biggest worry is that as soon as I mention I'm pregnant, either in the interview or after if I decide to wait, that they'll find another reason to not hire me, or they'll just fire me because they'd be within their rights in my state to fire without a cause/without having to disclose a reason. Other worry is that while I'm applying for a position that you don't want a big turnover as it can be detrimental to the clients, it's not a job that is hard to find people to do the job, whether they're good or not you often can't know until they've been there for some time, but they wouldn't necessarily think if they don't hire me they won't find someone else for a long time so I'm not sure how willing they'd be to work with me. But I think I am going to apply. I'm just going to have to tell them I won't quit my other job until I have an offer and I'm still going to give them a two weeks notice.</TEXT>

I have found that working in human services, people tend to be much more open to working with you. I guess I have to keep reminding myself that I do still have a job, it's just not the job that I ever thought would be permanent and I'm a person afraid of getting stuck in a place I don't want to be so I'm always looking for ways to keep moving towards what I want.</TEXT>

I've tried to tell her several times when she brings up things that they've done that they're cruel and don't want her. I've tried to tell her it's not a bad thing to not be accepted into a group of cruel people. The problem is that she also tries really hard to be cool and refuses to try to be friends with anyone who isn't cool. I know that they had her convinced that she had to bring all the team snacks to games, and she tried to have them all be handmade before my mom caught on and stopped it.

    <TEXT>I'm so glad to hear that it's also normal to not take to it quite right away - that means that if I don't, it won't be the first time and the nurses will likely know to just push me. Someone was telling me yesterday that with her first, she got upset when an experienced mom was burping her baby cause she didn't know that the baby was okay getting very firm pats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was talking to a friend and I mentioned something I had seen on the news that I figured she'd find really interesting. She was looking at her phone (as usual) and when I finished telling her about it, she said "oh, cool" and kept looking at her phone. Five minutes later, she said "Hey! Have you seen [same thing] in the news?" I called her out on it, but it hasn't changed the fact that she never listens to anything I have to say unless it's something she asked me about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like you said, kid-by-kid basis, but sometimes kids just like being talked about, even if they're not trying to be cute. Talking about them within earshot can make them recognize that they have your attention, and then they ramp their behavior because they know you're watching and they want to see how far they can go before you react how they want. That's where planned ignoring comes into play - but that's generally best for environments when you have basically total control (your house vs public areas).</TEXT>

I do agree with the person who said try them on in store if possible. Get a pair or two to hold you over until they have a really good sale. My only problem with them so far is that they do get stretched out easily but a wash will get them back to normal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a friend, who was fielding a lot of similar questions from me, tell me that as far as warmers for wipes and bottles, it's better to get the baby used to what will be normalized. If the baby won't have constant access to warm wipes, get him/her used to it early on instead of when you're out and about. And she said that with her second kid - he basically drinks milk almost straight from the fridge, or sometimes only room temp, since they didn't see the need for him to have all his bottles warmed and he's going to have to drink cold milk eventually anyways (although she did mention that some babies have more reflux problems with cold milk early on). It helped me feel less anxious as a FTM about what I need for baby since some of the things aren't hard rules must haves - and some of these things are modern conveniences that aren't absolutely required. She also said that all babies are different, so I'll probably still end up with things that I thought were necessary, but baby hates - like some kids hate rockers, while others love them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the tendency for depression was probably there to begin with - but having money makes it easier to give in to it because you're not forced to work and get out of the house most days. It's why I've told my husband that even if we get to the point where we can afford for me to be a stay at home mom, that I need to at least have a part time job - even if I'm not making any meaningful income after child care for that time. But I agree, having some more money would help reduce stress and maybe help with some of the mental heaviness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I was afraid of ruining my carefully built image. If I had succeeded that night, it's likely that my secret of being raped by my boyfriend would have gotten out along with the fact that I hadn't been handling it well for the previous couple of months despite the fact that I was a good college freshman and it looked like I had pretty much everything going for me. Looking back I realise that it was all that self imposed pressure that led me to try that night. And to be fair, I don't know why I pulled the needle out (survival instincts maybe) but the reason above is why I didn't try again - not because I got better. I began repressing the memories every time they came up, and it led to a pretty big break down my senior year in front of the man (who later became my husband) when I tried to have consensual sex with him. Now he's the reason I will never try again. He's helped me face what happened to me and process it. And if I had succeeded that night 7 years ago? I wouldn't be looking forward to holding our son in my arms in just a few more months.</TEXT>

Most places in my area wanted 3-4 dollars a slice, but luckily I knew someone who did wedding cakes for fun on the side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get why you're being downvoted, but honestly, I can see where you're coming from. I work with kids with autism and while I'd never wish a single one of them harm or death, I see the stress that the parents of the more affected kids go through. I see them struggle to connect to their child, to keep from yelling at their kid when the kid just has a really bad day. I've seen parents cry when, after months of working on a program over and over and over with them, the kid finally gets it. I've seen a mom struggle with the fact that her child shows more affection to myself than her (simply due to the amount of time I put into working on him being more comfortable with me touching his shoulder to get his attention). Anyone who denies that those parents are going through a much more difficult time and have a harder road ahead of them than many of the parents of typically developing children is doing both them and their children harm and is a disgrace. Everyone needs and deserves compassion and understanding.</TEXT>

She used to put a lot of pressure on my older sister to get married, which was pretty dumb since my sister wants to get married but she isn't going to settle for just anyone to make my mom happy. Then I got married (the fourth child) and suddenly my mom puts less pressure on my sister to go find a man (though I know she does still pressure her some). And their relationship has improved a lot. I can't really say I blame my mom - her siblings are competitive, but in a really petty kind of way. And I know my mom hates it, but I also am pretty sure that she's secretly proud that even though she was the last one to have a kid get married, she's also only the second to get a grandchild - the first grandson.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband acted pretty similarly until about 30ish weeks when he could consistently feel movement from the outside as well as seeing my body very obviously changing. Going to a labor class helped too. Before he didn't really feel much connection and baby tended to stop moving when he touched my belly so he wouldn't try much. But i kept putting his hand back. I'm pretty sure that the biggest factor in connecting him to the pregnancy was when he was reading something to me and I started laughing because baby kept rolling - but every time he stopped reading to look, baby stopped. So I told him to keep talking next time he looked, and sure enough, baby kept rolling to his voice. Just keep gently pushing your SO to be involved here and there. He'll get there. Your baby will start to respond to him too, and it'll start to click with him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm no expert on Medicaid, but I believe that since you aren't married and she doesn't yet have an income (and her insurance through her parents should be deemed inadequate for pregnancy) she should be eligible for Medicaid. Which I also believe will backdate to cover expenses related to the pregnancy - but of course still best to apply early. I have a friend currently getting prenatal care through Medicaid and just wanted to say that she is getting equal care as myself. We go to the same OB practice and are likely going to deliver in the same hospital. Also, consider going to a woman's health clinic and see if they have any information to help get good care as soon as possible. They might know places that will give prenatal care on a sliding scale.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just going to say that I really appreciate that Montana starts clearing the roads asap (except sometimes on weekends). The roads still aren't great while the snow is falling, but it's great that they get started on it so that by the time it does get to where it would have been 3-4", the roads are still easily passable. But we also tend to get 6-12+ inches at a time so it's probably the only real way to keep a handle on all the snow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just had my son yesterday afternoon (can't sleep cause adrenalin and cause he's so beautiful I can't stop looking over at him). But in the 13 hours since his birth, I have already received so many rewards from my little boy. His eyes on me while he eats, his response to my and my husband's voices, the way he calms down when I sing to him even when he's cold but is getting his diaper changed, and his little mewling sounds he makes when he sleeps. I know I'm just beginning, but I can't understand how there are parents out there who don't appreciate the little miracles they gave life to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband loves his. It's an '03 and sure, it has some problems, but not really anything more than what you'd expect from any car that age. Granted, it's also his pride and joy so he does its maintenance and constantly is making sure its in great condition - then pushes it to its limits when driving it. It's also manual. Don't know if that makes a difference.</TEXT>

They'll insure the rest of the pregnancy and save you a lot of money and stress over the money.

    <TEXT>Our realtor was also amazing - took everything we were looking for into account, showed us properties that were well below our budget that fit our requirements, spent several evenings showing us houses, and even helped us with knowing which schools were best and giving her experience with the schools. And that's why when my parents decided to move to the area, we sent them (and their 125k higher budget) straight to her. It's more profitable long term for a realtor to do a good job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right. In the North, the goal was to reunite the North and South. The South seceded in the first place over state's rights - they wanted states to have more say in laws than the federal government had. The driving force behind wanting states to have more say was mainly the issue of slavery. So yes, it was somewhat about slavery, but not completely. Lincoln said that if he could reunite the states without freeing a single slave, he'd do it. It's complicated. Also, there are many places in the South that refer to the American Civil War as the War of Northern Aggression - referring more to their view that the North was forcing their beliefs on a group of states that wanted to leave peacefully.</TEXT>

But anyways, maybe your dad always being late instilled your need for buffers?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I briefly worked at the McKinley Museum in Canton which displayed several of the letters written to this man (Sam Stone) who went by the pseudonym B. Virdot. The man compiling the letters before they were displayed showed them to me and told me that the man's grandson figured out that B. Virdot was a play on Stone's daughters' names (I think it was two girls, it's been a couple years). There's something really heartbreaking and yet uplifting (from the hope) when reading those letters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I stopped swaddling my son four nights ago (he's three months today). I had been swaddling him with his arms free for about a week (and off and on for the past month) since he would use them to completely break free of his blanket if they were swaddled inside. Then I did two nights of arms and legs free from the swaddle (basically a blanket wrapped fairly tight around his middle). He was still sleeping well so I decided to not swaddle him at all and so far, all four nights he's slept 8-9 hours straight still.</TEXT>

When we stopped swaddling him, his sleeping wasn't affected at all as far as I know since if he did wake up, he wasn't upset because he didn't wake me up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know the details, but my little sister was adopted from overseas when she was around 2 or 3. They wanted her for a companion for their biological daughter. I don't how she was at that age, but she's currently very bullheaded and doesn't like to do things other people's ways. They ended up sticking her in the foster care system because she wasn't a good match for their daughter. And when I say companion, I mean companion. They didn't want another daughter. They wanted another kid that would occupy their daughter's time that would be compliant and, I'm assuming, so grateful for being adopted from an orphanage that she would do anything that family asked of her with no troubles or complaints.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure because it's often hard to tell cost when you're on the outside only considering it instead of actively working towards adoption, but I'm pretty sure the 40k adoptions are the ones for infants from private companies that match you with a mother that has an unwanted pregnancy. The cost goes for the mother's healthcare (i think), lawyers, and of course for the people that helped find the pregnant mother for you. Adoption from the foster care system is much cheaper - Mostly paying for the paperwork to be filed and the significantly cheaper lawyer to oversee the paperwork. They're more motivated to get the kids adopted because they're more difficult to adopt out of foster care once they're past a certain age or if they're part of a sibling group.</TEXT>

I've always loved Christmas and I love my husband, but he doesn't think holidays are as wonderful as I do so I'm hoping that our son will be really excited by Christmas because holidays are even better when others are excited with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work as a behavior technician with kids with autism and I say that it will definitely get harder before it gets easier. But that's why you have to listen to the behavior therapist. Even if you would send him to a day program and he did great there, there's no guarantee that he'll also do great at home if bad habits continue to get reinforced at home. I've seen it several times where a kid's parents are at their wits ends because they give into the kid every time so any time they say no, he has a challenging behavior. And they give in again restarting that cycle. But when he's with us? Total sweetheart.</TEXT>

I often remind myself when I get frustrated with some parents that they're just doing what they feel they have to in order to survive. It's a lot easier for me to tell a parent to ignore a challenging behavior when it's not my child crying or it's not my sentimental valuables being broken or when I know that I only have to wait it out for an hour versus possibly having to wait out a behavior for several hours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll be honest, I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or sincere but I'm guessing sincere based on your post history. So I'll respond sincerely. I agree. I can't imagine living in a world where nearly everyone thinks and communicates differently than I do and then being told that there's something wrong with me because I don't behave the same way as everyone else. I've found that often people think that my job is to "fix" people with autism. And I think that's very wrong. I'm not "fixing" anyone. Instead, I believe what I'm doing is teaching these kids a new way to communicate what they want and need so they can more easily navigate this world in which most people see things differently than they do. But to get back to your point, yeah. I have no idea what it's like. I mentioned the difficulty parents have because I can communicate more easily with parents than with the kids I work with and so I understand their point of view more readily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They potentially don't want to think about it or face their own demons. After I was raped, I avoided anything that even remotely alluded to rape. Then I moved into a state in which I mentally (thankfully I never said these things out loud) degraded anyone who mentioned rape because I projecting my own insecurities and hatred of myself onto anyone who was able to speak up and who refused to be silenced. Since then I have acknowledged my rape out loud (and not just to a shitty counselor who didn't believe me) and I'm much less likely to project my insecurities about myself due to my rape on those who are more open about their experience with sexual assault. It's a lot easier to degrade others rather than face your own fears and insecurities. Edit: a misspelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm glad that this is a possibility because it can lead to great things (though I am also annoyed that some people take advantage if this and can get into such a sensitive role very easily). In my hospital, we have two lactation consultants. I really only know one of them well and she is amazing. She's been doing this for many years and keeps up with current research and I'm sad that she's retiring in less than a year. But anyways, along with the two lactation consultants, many nurses in L amp;D were technically also lactation consultants through a similar course I believe. They wore pink scrubs and if you planned on breastfeeding, they made sure to have at least one in your delivery room when the baby was born to help you begin your breastfeeding journey and they could help you if you needed it in the middle of the night. Then, during regular hours, one of the lactation consultants would come visit you and help you if you needed it.</TEXT>

And I got it fairly inexpensively by watching for their sale and then I found the same lillebaby on their page on Amazon and turns out it was the same sale price. And then I added it to my registry and got 15% off. I think it was originally $119 and I got it for $55 (but $20 of that was points I had from the credit card). So if you should decide that you want a lillebaby, this is an optional route.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 6 month old son has started to reach up for my face when I lean over him and when I get close, he squeezes and pulls me towards him and I learned that if I turn my face, he'll give slobbery "kisses" all over my cheek. If I don't turn I sometimes get them on my nose or he just makes faces at me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to help an elderly lady with her cleaning and gardening for a couple years. And it evolved into me taking her to her doctor appointments and grocery shopping. We always took her car and somehow, she always just happened to have things scheduled around lunch time so we always had to stop and she insisted on buying. When I got married and moved away, my sister took over and told me the elderly lady continued to insist on buying lunch. She passed away early this year, but I'll always think of her when I see a Bob Evans or a Wendy's as those were get favorite places to eat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work with kids with developmental and physical disabilities and they often can't verbally consent to me touching them even when necessary (transferring to/from wheelchairs, toileting help). But I've found that most of the kids seem a lot more at ease when I talk them through what I'm going to do and where I'm going to touch them as I help them. I can't imagine someone who intentionally touches people to make them uncomfortable working with people with disabilities. It pisses me off to see someone so blatantly disrespected but it makes my blood boil to think of someone doing the same thing to people who can't stand up for themselves.</TEXT>

I already work with data (specifically with kids with autism and have run assessments) and so it's important to me to test every item before I say yes, sometimes, or no on the paper.

It would probably be more difficult for me to terminate than it would for me to deal with pregnancy (which is the biggest reason we're one and done). At least with a pregnancy I could talk it out with my family. If I terminated and needed to talk about it, my family would make it even worse for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was just thinking about this today. My son is almost 11 months and I'm still able to breastfeed him which I'm really happy about. But I've also noticed that any attempts I make to lose weight -working out, counting calories - causes my supply to drop. So I've been choosing to lift weights in hopes that I'll have a routine to stick with once I wean him in a little over a month. It's really frustrating though when I workout 3-5 days a week and eat fairly healthy (though high calorie) and still weigh the same as I did right before I gave birth. My mom was apparently the same way.</TEXT>

Looking back I feel that I need to edit this comment to add that kids with disabilities in general are not dangerous or unsafe.

So now that I'm done nursing I'm ready to buckle down and get to a healthy weight. I've lost 16 so far - 100 more to go. I'm doing CICO and I try to get to the gym at least 3 times a week, but now that good weather is coming I'm looking forward to walking around town and hiking with my husband and son.

    <TEXT>Alternatively, if you have time, remove the child until they're calm and then return to the shopping. Just never give in if they're asking for something tangible. And in the future when going to the same store, don't talk about the last negative experience they had there. Let it go. It's a new day, a new chance. Obviously it's generally better to have a reinforcement plan in place before entering the store, "first we'll do all the shopping then we'll get/do something fantastic". Doesn't even have to be anything much - as long as the kid wants it. Plus set the kid up for success as much as possible in the beginning. Go right after nap/meal time so there in the best possible mood. Take that fun (preferably quiet and small and within reason) toy into the store, what's the kid hurting? Sorry about the long comment, but behavior management/modification is my job and I love to talk about it.</TEXT>

I don't want to up my activity level because I'm not consistent in moving that much, but I also don't want to get myself in trouble for eating too few calories since I'm already at a 1000 calorie deficit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know. I have my fitbit connected and it goes off of that. I don't generally eat my exercise calories (or if I do I do the half thing) but I also don't want to somehow hurt myself since they say that anything over 2lb (-1000 calories) isn't sustainable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've managed to log two days at a much higher step rate than normal. I've been walking on my 15 minute break instead of sitting on my phone and when I take the kid I work with to the cardio room I work out with him instead of half assedly peddling on the bike. I've also noticed that the leg strength exercises my friend and I do have been giving us more endurance for running. On a more personal (but related) front, I convinced my friend that I workout with to join the challenge. She's on the DADA team but we're holding ourselves more accountable to going to gym now that we're both competing. And I convinced her to buy a tape measure to record inches lost since she was discouraged about not losing weight.</TEXT>

I don't generally give unsolicited advice (at least I try not to), but I found that a steady supply of water and small bags of portioned high fat/high protein snacks like nuts and avocado were helpful for keeping my supply up without gaining as much weight as well staving off some of the nursing munchies.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-07 03:48:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I went to the gym after work as usual planning to meet my gym partner there. I walked halfway to the door when I realised I didn't have my key pass card. Okay, they'll sign me in. Got signed in and realised I forgot my water bottle in the car. Went back and grabbed it. Got changed and realised I don't have my travel bag with hair ties and no extras floating around. I was about to text my gym partner and ask her to bring me an extra when she called and something had come up so she had to cancel. No biggie, it happens. Finally went to the front desk and ask if they had any, had to go scrounge up a quarter in my car to buy one, and then I finally started my workout. But here's the thing. A few months ago I would have given up after I realised I had no hair tie and no gym partner that day. I would have maybe messed around with some small weights a bit so I wouldn't look like I left as soon as I arrived. Instead I carried on to W2D1 of c25k (which I accidentally closed halfway through and had to restart). I ended up going 3.85 miles and being on the treadmill for an hour. It felt really good to not make excuses and to carry on even when I kept forgetting things. So don't let little things get in your way. Find a way to step past excuses. It's worth it in the end. Oh, and here's the best part. While I realise the importance of learning to be accountable to myself, my biggest motivation to see the workout through was this community - specifically my team for the challenge. The community is so welcoming and supportive and competitive within itself that I wanted to continue to do my part. So thanks to this whole big wonderful supportive community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and I bought a house because we could see the prices of rent and mortgages around us increasing at a high rate. So we went and got a mortgage. At the time our mortgage was about $200 dollars higher than our rent had been. That was a year and a half ago. Our friend who lives in the same apartments that we had been in thought we were being stupid to invest in a slightly higher mortgage when we sometimes struggled to make rent (aka we couldn't go party with her because we needed that money for rent). She's now frustrated because rent has increased too high for her to afford (higher than our mortgage) but she also can't find an affordable mortgage now either. Not that everyone can afford to switch from rent to owning, but we were in a place where it cost basically the same and are fortunate to have good credit and were eligible for a program that got us a lower interest rate despite having no down payment.</TEXT>

And then the gym afterwards and waking around my parents' neighborhood until they got home with my kid. But then I was just so close to 40k that I decided to push for that. And I did it!

    <TEXT>One thing that has definitely changed for me is the number of steps I take. My Fitbit average was about 9000 per day before the challenge and is currently about 18,000 a day. Typically during the work week I get 20,000-25,000 steps a day. I'm still trying to work on increasing my weekends. The habit that changed is that I walk or on my breaks during work and I'm not consistent with going to the gym or hiking at least four days a week. I'm a little concerned going into the summer (I work at a school) that my fitness is going to tank because I won't be forced to leave the house every day. I've been making a plan for how to combat that. My friend and I are planning on hiking every day during the week and going to the gym once or twice a week when my husband will be home to care for our kid. And my husband wants to do additional hiking once he's off work. But I've learned during this challenge that if I set a goal for myself and I tell someone, that I'm more honest with myself and more consistent with working towards my goals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't hit my goal, I was 2lb away but still lost 13lb during this challenge. I learned a lot about what my body can do. I went from an average of 9000 daily steps to an average of about 20,000 daily steps. I started jogging and I can jog for 12 minutes now. I didn't push myself to see how much I could do before but with the motivation of needing more steps with the same amount of time available for working out, I pushed myself to jog longer to get more steps. Seeing what my body can do has helped me respect my body more and want to take care of it more - including eating well. But most of all, I've been learning to relax and that it's okay to take maintenance days every now and then. It helps to be reminded that I won't always be restricting calories but it's also a good reminder that even when I'm not longer restricting calories I don't have carte blanche to eat myself sick - I'm still responsible for caring for this amazing hard working body. I did hit one goal though - one of my favorite t shirts fits me again! I'm planning on taking an after picture and posting it on discord at some point soon with my before picture from the very beginning of the challenge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My MIL tried to pressure me into circumcising my son. Granted, my SIL didn't have her son circumcised and then didn't really take good care of him so he ended up needing the surgery at four years old because it got so infected, so I can see why she thinks not circumcising is bad. I told my MIL that we've done our research and we feel more comfortable not circumcising and she let it go after 3-4 conversations about it. Thankfully not circumcising is becoming a lot more common in the US and I was able to find a pediatrician that supports my decision and also knows how to care for an infant's uncircumcised penis because I've heard some not so great stories of pediatricians giving bad advice about foreskin care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the biggest problem is that people treat people with disabilities with pity rather than compassion. And acting in pity, they try to bubble wrap them from the world and treat them like they're helpless babies rather than people with different challenges. Acting in compassion (like it sounds like you do) means consciously acting in ways that acknowledges that they have challenges with some areas (loud noises, routine changes, etc) and not being a dick but also not preventing them from experiencing the world because of limitations you've placed on them rather than the limitations they've find that they're comfortable with.</TEXT>

It's also been a struggle I've had since starting in a new position last fall because I've been working with some paras who have been in this job for years and they pushed back hard when I worked to change how we approach working with some of the kids because it meant our job went from more of a babysitting type job to a job that actively worked to improve the kids' skills (ya know, what we were hired for and get paid to do).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a behavior therapist who has worked with older kids/adults who learned to go straight to violence as a problem solving method. Yeah, it takes time, but we've helped these people learn how to control their violent behavior. Without smacking them across the head, as the other commenter suggested. I'm pretty sure I have a higher than average knowledge of how to influence a child's behavior. And sure, if my son shows problematic behavior when he's that age, I'll work with his teachers/adults in his life to implement a plan on how to correct that behavior, but honestly, behavior that could be considered harassment when he's older will probably be developmentally appropriate at a young age and I will address it as it comes up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh hell yeah. Always address behavior as soon as it is safe and preferably after everyone involved has has a chance to reset and calm themselves. Sure it can be a pain in the ass if you have to put something on hold to address a behavior or to ignore a behavior when it's distracting but needs to be ignored, but having an immediate healthy purposeful response/nonresponse (even if it's a neutral response until the kid is able to regain control of themselves) is the one of the first steps in correcting a behavior before it becomes a huge problem. And I realise that we're probably not going to see eye to eye on this, but I think that what you're labeling as "new age" methods are more effective and should be the first response rather than physical punishment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My experience is a little different in that the man who raped me was my boyfriend, but after it happened (and after I finally left him a few months later) I threw myself into working out without working on my mental state which led to unhealthy calorie restriction which turned into binge eating when another man started to show interest in dating me. Since then I've gotten my mental health into a better state - not always great, but definitely better. What helps me with the weight loss is that I'm also doing strength training because even though I know it likely wouldn't have made a difference, I like the idea that I could fight him off if I would need to. That doesn't mean that I don't still struggle at times. I have to be very careful that I don't start restricting calories too much again and some days I can hardly get out of bed and have to fight the urge to eat all the junk food because that small part of my brain that tells me that I don't deserve to be happy with my body. But I'm lucky to have a supportive husband (who knows everything) who encourages me and reminds me that my worth is so much more than what my body does or doesn't look like. I'm not sure if that's the kind on response you were looking for when you posted but that's my experience in a nutshell and I'm willing to answer questions if you have any you want to ask.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Technically yes on the second part, because being anorexic means that the person is underweight regardless of cause. Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by eating too few calories and is considered a psychological disorder. It has nothing to do with the current weight of the person with AN though being underweight can be a symptom. However, in the US at least, anorexia and being anorexic have both become commonly used terms for Anorexia Nervosa which means when being used generally and not medically, when someone says anorexic, they are usually talking about the eating disorder, not the characteristic of being very unhealthily underweight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worry so much that my depression is going to affect my relationship with my son. I mostly have it and my panic attacks managed, but there are still days that I just sit on the couch and don't have the energy to do anything when I should be on the floor playing with him. And then the guilt other moms put on moms about screen time makes it worse because when I'm having a day when I can barely get off the couch, the best thing I can do in that moment is turn on the TV for him. Thankfully I live close to my parents and they can generally take him when I need a day or two to get back on track. I'm working on finding a therapist, but I've been to three in the past that weren't great and it makes it hard to keep looking for a good one that I can work with. And yes very much on not touching during panic attacks! My husband has learned how to best approach when I'm having one, which is to just talk to me calmly and every once in a while ask if he can hold me until I can nod my head. I still flinch a lot then too but it's better than me taking a swing at him. Also, for what it's worth, I generally can function well through my depression, which made me deny that I had it for a long time. Sure I was dealing with my own voice in my head constantly telling me when I messed up and reminding me that everyone hates me, but I thought that it was pretty normal because I always thought depression was being completely unable to function. It manifested for me more like anxiety and I had to get everything done and it had to be done right and when I couldn't do it, I would just crash. I turned to self harm to give me energy (sounds weird, I know) to keep me going so that I wouldn't ruin the next thing I had to do which really put me in a vicious cycle. It wasn't until I started having panic attacks after my ex, who exploited my mental illness, raped me that I began to recognize that something was seriously wrong with me and I started trying to get help, which is hard when you don't want anyone in your personal life to know. Like I said, it's mostly managed now with most of the credit going to my wonderful husband.</TEXT>

Not because I'm ashamed of them, but because the people who comment on them generally start asking about them and I don't like to talk about why I did it which is what they generally want to know. It feels voyeuristic and it makes me feel gross. Either that or they get all judgemental and act like I'm still the same person who made those scars without knowing how far I've come and again, makes me feel gross.</TEXT>

Because my husband and I are considering fostering in a few years (when our house is big enough to give a kid or two their own room/s) but while I occasionally buy new clothes (underwear, shoes, socks, good sales), most of my wardrobe is from thrift stores. Is that frowned upon when fostering? Because I have a hard time paying high prices for new clothes when you can get good clothes at a thrift store for reasonable prices. But I also don't want any kids that we would foster to think that we're buying them cheap clothes because we want to pocket the rest of the money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And if you use my medical center, you get to send your insurance after them every single time you get a bill because they will charge you for things that insurance covers because they either billed it wrong or because insurance paid it and now they want us to pay for it too (both have happened to us) plus they're notorious for double billing something you paid months before. And it's useless to call the hospital because they'll "look into it" and we end up getting another bill for either the same amount or higher a few weeks later. Thankfully my husband keeps good records and has an amazing insurance woman who he has to call every few months. And no, switching medical centers isn't an option since I don't want to drive 30 minutes to another doctor when I already have the best pediatrician in the area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm having such a hard time getting back on track. I was doing great and then summer started and I went on vacation where I decided to eat at maintenance, which I did pretty well at even though I didn't really track. But since getting back I'm doing terribly at getting back into eating at a deficit and I'm barely doing any exercise. For reference, when summer started I was at 20k+ average steps per day and now I'm down to about 5k. I'm doing a strength training class twice a week but that's the only time I get to the gym. My toddler is wonderful, but mentally exhausting to keep up with especially when I only get about 4-5 hours of sleep at night and I never get to see my husband because of his hours. I can't wait for school to start again because I need to get out of the house and work. I'll probably get back on track with the gym again once I'm working since I go straight from work to the gym so I don't feel guilty about leaving my son with my parents just to go to the gym.

I know my husband doesn't think like that, sometimes I think he forgets I have that in my past at all, but even though I've worked through not letting that past control me, it still hurts sometimes. A lot of times I think it's because I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian household and when I did eventually open up about it to my friends, I felt incredibly judged for losing my virginity before marriage.

    <TEXT>Right?! Usually I just ignore things that are in the wrong spot (unless there's a bunch of wrong things). I initially laughed and then I saw tags and checked them out. I don't even look in the bra section cause I never find anything my size, much less brand new. Sorry person who tried to hide them.... But even I didn't hesitate before grabbing them once I saw the size and I usually wait until things are the lowest possible price. Alternatively they might not have been seen in go backs from the dressing room?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom liked to tell me that my son is "all boy" because he likes to climb and get dirty and be stereotypically a boy. Sometimes she'll also say "he's just like his mom" when he's doing the same things because I was a dirty, running, climbing kid too. One day when she said "he's all boy" I asked her if that meant I was a boy when I was a kid since he's also just like me. Haven't heard the all boy comment in a while now. But seriously, props to my mom who was raised conservatively with gender stereotypes but has been starting to change some of those views.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I became someone I hated during the Kavanaugh hearings. It took me a while to realise that the reason I was acting bitter and angry and having trouble getting out of bed again wasn't just my depression, but it was me reacting to my own fears and trauma that I thought I had dealt with. I love my husband and he tries so hard to be supportive, but he just doesn't get it. He couldn't figure out why it was bothering me so much. It wasn't descriptions of the allegations against Kavanaugh that was bothering me, it was the victim bashing and people around me refusing to consider that it might have happened. The same people that I either a) refused to tell about me being raped because I knew they'd make jokes/wouldn't believe me/would likely side with my rapist or b) people who knew what happened to me and acted like I brought it on myself. Not sure what my point was except to just get that out. It's funny how candidly I can talk about what happened to me on the internet to strangers but I can't say the words out loud to my husband or a therapist.</TEXT>

There have been many times that I've cried because we're OAD and it wasn't until recently that I started to realise it's because I'm sad that I didn't get to have the pregnancy experience I wanted. I didn't have my mom around to talk to and feel the kicks. I didn't get to have the waiting game of when will I go into labor. I know I should be so grateful that I didn't get preeclampsia until I was late enough into the game (37+1) that they could induce as soon as they discovered it, but I still mourn for the lost experiences that I looked forward to. But I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that I'm not really wanting to have another baby, I'm wanting those missed experiences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is partially why I buy at thrift stores. You can generally find quality clothes that still have a lot of life in them for a lot cheaper than you'd find them in a regular store. The biggest problem with thrift stores right now is that they've suddenly become what seems like a fad and thrift stores have noticed and are starting to up their prices. But small local stores (so not Goodwill or, depending on your area, salvation army) still tend to have lower prices though you might have to put more work into going through the store. If you want to go to Goodwill or salvation army, they tend to have days that certain tag colors are half off or more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand what you're saying with it being concerning, but it's really hard to question things when you're raised in an environment where you're pretty much taught that to try to understand things like abortion in a different way is to question God. That sounds like no big deal when you already don't believe in God, but it's terrifying when you've been taught your whole life that if you reject God and his ways you'll be sent to burn in hell along with all the other horrible people in the world. All the horrible people out there sinning who actually feel miserable because only God is joy. So if you question God's ways, you'll be miserable and a horrible person. That's why I didn't really start questioning a lot of things until after I was raped and terrified that I would get pregnant and be forced out of my Christian college and forced to raised a baby I didn't want. I got lucky and didn't get pregnant. But that's when I started questioning things. And I started getting better answers. Sure, I was miserable at first, but also relieved to realise that I was miserable when I believed in God, but at least now I felt free to experience my feelings without guilt. I guess what I'm saying is the brainwashing can be strong. But I also had people in my life that I thought I was trying to fix, who ended up being my support when I began to question things. Which is why I still hang out with people who believe differently than I do. They give me a different perspective and I try to give them mine. Sorry, really long response to say 'I agree with you, but this is why it was hard in my experience'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Montana, where I wouldn't have expected prices to go up a lot. Shirts that I've seen at Walmart for $3 are at Goodwill for $3.99. Bigger brand shirts are generally $7.99 which isn't terrible if they're usually $20, but I probably could have gotten it brand new for $10 at some point. I've seen some stained stretched out brand names marked at $12.99. Dresses are starting to be base marked at $9.99 with brand items being marked at $24.99. I'll only buy coats in the summer because they're usually priced better, but in the winter I've seen them marked as $39.99 for a coat I could get new for $45. Good news is that means that things I want are more likely to make it to dollar day which is when I prefer to shop.</TEXT>

Honestly if it weren't for the EMTs and the mental health guy, I probably would have gone straight home from the hospital and hurt myself more than I already had.

I was being observed on my first couple of days at my last job which included helping a child with developmental disabilities use the toilet and when it came time to use the toilet I talked the kid through what I was going to do. "It's time to use the bathroom, I'm going to help you pull your pants down and then I'll help you sit on the toilet." I do this with all the people I work with (adults and kids) and my supervisor that day told me she knew I was definitely the right choice when she saw me talk the kid through what we were going to do because most people don't bother talking to the kids (and sometimes the adults) because they either think they won't understand or that they're just used to it happening so there's no reason to tell them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cool! I've started to think that almost no one from this area uses Reddit.... But that's probably more because I don't say my location unless it's in a smaller more social group (like this or looking for other parents).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Babies are hard. Especially the first 8ish weeks before they start to smile. But education starts as soon as they're born. You can read to a baby and although the baby won't understand the words or the concept really, just reading to your infant jump-starts language development. And the best part is, when they're little, you can read literally anything you want to them. My husband read some Dracula to our son. I read my fantasy books to him. He didn't care. We were interacting with him and telling him stories. Now he's a toddler and I feel like all we ever read are the same three books. But you know what? He loves those books. And he loves sitting in his chair and pretending to read out loud to us. That was a bit of a tangent, but the point is - even if you don't feel like you're actively educating your baby, it's okay. They learn so much from just being with you and watching how you interact with other people and things in your environment. The baby stage shapes a lot of who they grow up to be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a "friend" that wouldn't make that a condition, but my husband and I started to notice that after she would invite us out, she would keep making comments about how she bought this or that and now she's broke and we would generally pay for her meal (not that she had to tell us the stories, my husband generally covers the meal when we're with friends anyways). Then after I told him that we need to step paying for everyone else's meals, suddenly this "friend" stopped inviting us to do things with her and wouldn't really hang out with us even though we'd invite her to do things that didn't cost money. It's even more ridiculous considering her parents pay for everything for her including her rent and student loans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work in a special education classroom and our kids tend to get sick more easily than most kids. It's not in our area yet but it probably will be soon since we get a lot of traffic from Washington. So I'm kind of at the point where I'm thinking that if my son has a fever, I'm going to be the one staying home from work. I'm not going to risk getting those kids sick, and I'm not going to send him to my parents to get them sick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We teach a few kids this in our class (para in a SPED classroom) but not very often just because we're middle school and it's so much harder for kids to learn it as they get older and more set in what they're used to. We use Proloquo as a school. Otherwise we use a lot of picture cards (PECS) for communication but it's harder as far as transporting a large vocab.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, but at least he's doing something with it instead of sitting on it. He does donate to WHO which will then decide what gets researched. And if the government would decide to take these billionaires, then they would have a chance to help decide where the money goes, but the government refuses to tax them like that - likely because then the different political parties will lose their individual donations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Masks are mandated here but police refuse to respond to anything about people ignoring the mandate. Store employees will remind customers to put on their masks, but with the news stories about employees getting assaulted for just reminding someone to wear a mask (and with a ton of people around here protesting masks in public areas while carrying unnecessarily large guns), I'm not surprised that no one in my area is getting kicked out for ignoring the mandate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe the correct answer is (assuming the teacher was shot through the door) for the kids to stay calm and quiet and remain in place so the shooter doesn't know there are more potential victims inside. Depending on the age of the students and if the shooter has a line of sight to the teacher who has been shot, the teacher might be looking for an answer about quietly applying basic first aid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is. My first year working in a school I was taught how to disarm an intruder coming through the doorway whether they were carrying a gun with a long barrel or a short barrel. I was taught how to assess whether it's better to run or lockdown and what to use to lockdown a classroom. I learned where most first aid emergency bags in my area of the school are kept and how to tie a tourniquet properly. We get retrained on this regularly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. Plus, for me anyways, as an adult I'm able to look for my own therapist without worrying about my parents pushing one on me that holds to their belief system. I've finally found a therapist as an adult that treats me as a human that is in need of support and help rather than a kid making things up or who just needs to be more religious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a pretty useless therapist at one point, but one thing he told me has stayed with me and helped me several times: Look for the next thing in your life and wait until then to reconsider. Except every time you look for another "next thing". Sometimes I have to create things. Sometimes I have to ask my husband to help me find something. And sometimes I don't have something and I have to resort to back up things to keep me going - but that's my most helpful least destructive method.</TEXT>
