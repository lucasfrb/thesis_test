    <DATE>2019-10-18 10:49:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm buildning an armylist for a 1500 pts firendly tournament (if one can call a Khornate warband friendly) Currently it's one battalion World eaters and an outride-detachment of red corsairs. The worldeaters detachement is standard zerks in rhinos wth Kharn and stuff, the red corsairs is focused on speed with bikers, a spawn and warp talons (yes, they suck but i like them) I wanna try a jump lord as HQ, but in the red corsairs he would loose one attack in the charge, however we would get the adance and charge... That could be achived with talisman of burning blood, but then i cannot take the combi-melta on steriods.. Any opionos ? I'm leaning towards keeping him in the red corsairs...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea is to load up 8 zerks + exalted champ + kharn in dreadclaw to zip across or deepstrike If I go first and depending on deployment the dread and bikes could get a first turn charge off to deliver an early punch , clear chaff andf maybe lockup a vehicle or two. If I go secound, the dread would probbaly deepstrike along with the jumplord and warp talons. I'm currently struggling if the outriders should be red corsairs (+1cp, advance+charge) or WE, the warptalons and jump lord would definately benefit from WE but to get an early charge they probably need to advance... Turn two, the jumplord and talons deepstrike in, charge to prevent overwatch and hopefully the zerks in rhinos made it up the board 'till then and can slam in to wreck havoc! The idea is to be more flun/fluffy than competetive!  #8203; \+++ World eaters 1500 Fast attack (Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition) \[90 PL, 8CP, 1,499pts\] +++ \++ Outrider Detachment +1CP (Chaos - Chaos Space Marines) ++ Legion: Red Corsairs Specialist Detachment: Host Raptorial \+ HQ + Chaos Lord with Jump Pack: Combi-plasma, Mark of Khorne, The Tip of the Claw, Thunder hammer \+ Fast Attack + Bikers: Icon of Wrath, Mark of Khorne .

Then jumplord made an effort and got faced with a Malcador defender (overwatch on 5+) + defensive gunners; +1 hit on overwatch + vengence for cadia ; reroll hits and wounds against chaos = gt; shot to pieces After that, the warp talons got shot of the board... along with rest of the army (low point game) In hindsight the jumplord should have tried to charge the leman russ tank and then pile into the other, only difference would have been overwatch on 5+ since same strategems would have been played.. but still could have made a difference..

    <TEXT> #8364;30 is quite low budget.. But warm aluminium insulated felt soles instead of normal dry suit ones makes some difference for a very low cost. Most people recommend merio wool as a really warm fabric, but i've never tried it.

To be a good instructor (and the world does not need more bad ones) I believe you need to love diving and have a bank of experience to share and learn from! I personally don't you should rush through the course curriculum with minium experience... So, get certified and have fun, then make the decision! And regarding making a living in the field of diving, it is a tough business, you can probably survive as diev bum teaching newbies in some caribian island but enought to retire, nahh.. Then you need to run a dive center with sales, service and random dive jobs etc.. And even then it is tough..</TEXT>

Also converted a dreadclaw drop-pod to land Kharn, exalted champ and 8 zerks for a nasty surprise! With the new Faith and Fury, i'm thinking a squad of red butchers and a chaos lord in teminator armour with warlordtrait +1 charge. With carefull planning of space, you could get a very hard turn2 punch with 8" and 6" charges and hopefully just punch a shooty castle into bits! With new strategem to consolidate 6", you could surround vehicles to prevent falling back and then not get shot to pieces! It is a onetime swing or miss, but it could be nasty nasty nasty!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 50 cents after hundreds of dives in temps from 0C to 30C and playing underwater rugby for 5+ years This seems to work for me: 1. Get a good fitting mask with proper tempered glass (marked T) 2. Clean inside of glass by rubbing toothpaste a minute or two, rinse 3. Spit in DRY mask, if glass is wet the spit will not "attach" properly 4. Rinse mask and put it on. After that, mask stays on(more of an issue in the pool where beginers tend to put mask on forehead as soon as they surface) 5. As stated, don't exhale through the nose Never had any fogging issues, but I guess there could be individual variations in defogging property of ones spit, however I heard "the greener, the cleaner!" :D</TEXT>

Put the mask face without strap and inhale, if the underpressure keeps mask on it fit snug and probably will not leak. Then clean inside of glass by rubbing toothpaste or quick burnoff with lighter.

    <TEXT>I've converted a drop pod to dreadclaw, works ok to drop 8zerks, kharn and an exalted champion. The 15" flyer movement can give the opponent some headache but overall I think the drill looks better. Last game I had a dreadclaw with stated loadout, wart talons, jumplord, raptors and a unit of red butchers in deepstrike.. Cost 4cp (red butchers, host raptorial and field commander) but it was sure funny to watch my opponents face when the hammer struck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've made a nice convertion following a guide online. Sizewise it is quite accurate, a bit taller and more narrow. I added lots of spikes from plasticard to recreate the feel of the "iris" at the bottom. I'll threw some pics in the subreddit, here is the link to it https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/di4hw7/converting_a_sm_droppod_to_a_chaos_dreadclaw_drop/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my instructors said "No matter how much training and gear you have, you can never breath water" I would argue that most people die in shallow water after making some small mistake.. A friend of mine forgot to turn on his air in his twinset and layed down on his back in 3ft of water to mount fins before realising.. He made it but was really shaken by it... Point being: accidents happens regardless of depth... The belief that depth is a killer, is in it self a killer... Generally scuba is safe if you adhere to the training and regulations, at least not more dangerous than other activities involving water, equipment and vehicles I think driving to the dive site is more dangerous than the actual dive The statistics is halting due to people not reporting mere incidents, but some organisations such as BSAC publish reports yearly Interested in picking up scuba diving?</TEXT>

It's like allowed speed on the freeway, going 10kph below can still kill you and going 10kph above will not automatically kill you... I've seen people "corking" (local term for uncontrolled acent is "to cork") from 33m after 20min dive time with zero effects.. Although we put person on O2 for 30min just in case, but no symptoms appeared I myself have had early onset on DCS (itching skin) after keeping within the computer limit but doing several dives in cold water on same day So.. it is statistics, not law...More or less dice rolling with different probabilities</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you should use stainless steel double enders and bolt snaps (like the ones used in this guide http://dir-diver.com/en/equipment/stagebottle_rigging.html) They are made for diving and more than well tested. Dont try to take a cheap choice here, get the real thing from a dive shop. It will pay off in the long run. A carabiner can open on its own if you swim by a line and hook on. If you are unlucky, it can be really hard to open again, and then you are caught under water... The double enders and bolt snaps must be opened manually. A carabiner with "screw lock" (like used in climbing) can be used if it's not something you need to open. Last note, please avoid the xmas-tree setup with gear hanging all over, get pockets and store gear there. If you dive in a suit without pockets, a pair of cave shorts are simply pulled on top and gives you two big and nice pockets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tech shorts example: [https://www.divegearexpress.com/dgx-neoprene-pocket-shorts](https://www.divegearexpress.com/dgx-neoprene-pocket-shorts) Regarding the use of carabiners in diving, im not extremly experienced but have dived with shitloads of people logging 1000+ dives from all major organisations (NAUI, GUE, TDI, Swedtech, PADI etc...) and never seen anyone using carbiners. It is double enders and bolt snaps (like the one linked [https://www.divegearexpress.com/hardware/sssnaps](https://www.divegearexpress.com/hardware/sssnaps) ) all the way... To me, that says something... For gear setup, regardless of opionon on GUE, they have some details figured out, take a read [https://www.gue.com/equipment-configuration](https://www.gue.com/equipment-configuration) Also, alumium can dissolve in salt water, especially in contact with steel..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are not very used to water, get some water training like swimming, water polo, basic freediving or snorkeling... Really helps with diving since the stress of being in water is so much less For me, the background in freediving was really helpful, knowing you can hold breath for a while greatly reduces panic when doing exercises with no regulator in mouth As instructor, I appreciate when students keep active, focused and are interested. Also, try to be neat and tidy from the start, dont let gear spill all over, keep it neat, take care of stuff... 3x3 feet it all space you need for all the kit lastly, have fun, do as you are taught and trust in your training</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just want to share a quick afteraction review of my latest game, what went well/not so well Just played a game with pure WE against AM/admech-soup with one knight, one vindicare and 4 basilisks.. My list below but basically dual battalion, host raptorial with WT, daemon princes and basic rhino+zerk We had dawn of war deployment, i had first turn The good: - Raptors with apoleptic frenzy together and warlord with violent urgency gave 9+12+12+1 threat range and a cheeky turn 1 charge. Managed to trap one lone company commander and not kill him turn one (more cheeky placement to prevent overkill) Thus no fallback and no shooting them -Rhinos popping smoke and having DA giving 5++ are surprisingly resilient - WT plus jumplord easily took down one lone basilisk (7" +1" charge with tip of the claw and violent urgency The bad -Totally missplaced my red butchers,they never saw melee but had effective bolter output -Snipers, especially vindicare wrecks havoc in my lines - Missed trapping one character because I underestimated how easily mere guardsmen kill raptors... Should not have multicharged - A melee knight is murder to WE, managed to charge it but he wiped my zerks with is interupt same with kharn We hade to quit in turn3, then equal on points but I was more or less wiped.....

Point being, try to make it work, not automatically necessary to give up diving.

    <TEXT>I'm a sucker for WYSIWYG and the flamer came with the ebay-rhino... Still toasted 4 guardsmen with it so it payed its cost.... The combi plasma on jump lord and max plasma loadout on raptors are to do some vehicle/ill placed character hunting. The original idea for the raptors was to deepstrike with lord, then i can get 6 supercharged plasma (re-rolling 1s) of before the charge. Can kill smaller vehicles or put a dent in larger ones. The combibolter can be used for demonshell if something needs loose the last few wounds No, not the most competitive, but still give me some shooting before the carnage starts I would have placed the red butchers closer to the middle in order to try and get a swing at the knight, but my opponent had a large blob of infantry screening me so options for deepstrike was limited... I don't think i could have won, the snipers and knight was simply to much for my list...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Regarding the amount of pool time, consider yourself lucky! More time in water is what we all need, you need to build muscle memory. If I understand correctly, your Swedish? (jag  #228;r ocks #229; svensk). Swedish conditions typically need a slightly more prepared diver when doing open water, the visibility and temperature is what it is. So more pool time will help alot! Which dive centre/club will you train with? Best of luck and welcome to a hobby that will leave you vold, wet and broke... :D Let me know if you need more advices!

    <TEXT>in order yes yes and no, po2 is a thing with air aswell, but below 50+ m... so for rec, one can call it related to nitrox saftey stop are optional voluntary stops, they follow less rigid rules than deco, so 3-5 meters for 3-5 minutes are norm, use what you feek comfortable and trained with typically it gets harder to keep trim/position closer to surface due to surf and rapid expansion of gas, there people choose different depths. also depends on dive site and conditions. (for example if bottom is 6m, then using it as reference us better than free water at 3m) choose you favourite if no other input. I like 6m as it is the same as for oxygen deco stop. settings is probably also related to how computer calculates deco, i.e. will give you last deco stop at that depth. its related to issues mentioned above. I would use 6m</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been thinking of putting 5 red butchers into a dreadclaw and not deepstrike it but use it's 15" movement to get them up the board.. The idea is to use 3 rino-packed zerks and a dreadclaw together with a DA to give either -1 to hit or 5++ 6" bubble and a jumplord (or DP with wings) with violent urgency to shift things up the board with speed Advance DA will give on average move of 6"+1"+3" which gives 16" range of 5++ bubble, then the rhinos and dreadclaw advances up halting to just keep withing the bubble, after that the jumploads runs up behind the castle Having a large flying thing in your lines tends to make opponent focus firepower on it instead of more valued targets even after troops have disembarked **The pros:** 15" movement with fly Can take terminators Can cause at least some damage in shooting/melee No loss of movement/BS with brackets **The cons:** No smoke launchers Big model = gt; hard to hide behind LoS-blockers Expensive compared to rhino</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess you want to model the icon as a standard or something? The new kits have small item that can mimic "icons" but no real flags. (like this [icon](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Warhammer-40k-Chaos-Space-Marine-Chaos-Icon-A-New-Style-/113717962740) ) You need to make a small conversion if you want it as a flag. The rules (as I understand) does not state that the icon has to be a flag (or equivalent). It is totally up to you how you want to represent the icon, could be one model with different coloured shoulderpads or holding some trinket That said, I've modelled all my icon bearers as normal standard bearers to fit the theme of my army</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess if you really want to, a small bauer ([bauer junior II](https://www.bauer-kompressoren.de/products/breathing-air-sports/compact-line-100-140-lmin/junior-ii-100-lmin/)) is an idea. Available with 110V-220V and fairly easy to maintan, however, it is not the fastest compressor around. Cost is about 2500 EUR + extra equpiment (like automatic condensate drain etc) Maybe combine with a fill bank (a 300 bar 50-80l tank is only 1000 EUR) We use one when going on excursions to places where there is no other place to fill</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just played 500 pts ITC-league game against necrons, after a lot of agony I brough a slim battalion of chaos lord, MoE, 2x5 zerks+2 rhinos and some cultists Opponent had 20 warriors, a cryptek, some scarabs and a doomsday ark The map was 4'x4' and deploying in each corner with 9"-bubble in middle ([mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk4rt1zUrl8mb2N_4Y_cLUAmSC72momZeFLiG-PF3sE/edit?usp=sharing)) My opponent forgot the extra 3" range when disembarking from vehicle leaving him open to a sneaky T1 charge when the zerks + lord leaped out of their rhino I killed of most warriors but he used ressurection protocol and veil of time to bring them back in the opposite corner. however i tagged his doomsday ark and could finish it of in T3. After that i kept scoring recon, behind enemy lines, engineers with rhinos and hold more and won 28-14 The biggest MVP was a simple footslogging chaos lord with violent urgency and talisman of burning blood, the advance+charge and reroll combined with +1 advance and +1 charge gave him suprisningly good threat range even if he was on foot Also, 5 berzerkes with stoke the nails, wild fury and veterans of the long war pack a serious punch well above their weightclass Also rhinos performed well absorbing a lot of overwatch and zipping around to score objectives. Cultists were shot of the board straight away, MoE just camped one objective marked and didn't see combat. All and all, the decision to take a battalion was correct, the extra CP was really useful!

    <TEXT>Just played 1750pts itc against alpha legion/red corsairs and won 30-21. Opponent had chosen blob, cultist blobs and warptalons My secondaries were reaper (he had two 30 strong cultist blobs), recon and behind enemy lines Deployment was "search and destroy" which gave my terminators a first turn charge after using apoplectic frenzy. they killed 30+ cultists and then acted as distraction carnifex next turn. I say they did their job! The best moment and tactica was when he shot one rhino to pieces and then charged my berzerkers with squad of csm. I interupted, wiped unit and played Kill Maim Burn! This strategem is quickly becoming my favourite! I consolidated into his bikers and since it was not my charge phase I could attack them and wiped them as well. Warlord-trait violent urgency is awesome, jumplord zipping around killing stuff and letting others make combat. I used a daemon prince with talisman of burning blood to jump behind his lines and kill the warlord Cheap character like Master of execution was great to put in rhinos and the just camp on objectives when rhino moved of and also giving recon. I never get any good use out of my dark apostle, the castle is broken up so nothing is within range and he is to slow to follow. Will probably use exalted champ instead Also, kharn always fail.. Now he killed a couple of chosen then got wasted by a champion with a power fist... (after taking some sniper shots) The game had a lot of small tactics, like using last command point to use scorn of sorcery to save one berzerkers, keeping a large unit of chosen tied up in combat and preventing them to charge my character behind All and all, fun game with infantry vs infantry and almost no vehicles or ranged fire</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The deco tables are not such an exact science that bobbing +-1m will have any major impact.. What is worse is the partial pressure on your deco gas mix. When breathing pure O2 at 6m depth you are on the very border of what considered "safe". Dropping 1m will put you in the "dangerzone", especially if you drop another and so on.. Loosing the exact bouyancy in the other direction and accidentally surfacing is a potential for injury. The focus on maintaining a given depth is more a saftey measure to avoid loosing the depth all together. A smaller variation with smaller movements will have less risk of involuntary depth changes. My advice for maintaining depth is to always have a reference, like bottom, line to smb or such. Just hanging in green water with zero reference other than computer is hard. practice you breathing cycle and try to minimise travel</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes.. and being "correctly" bouyant with regards to bcd/suit. You should be perfectly weighted at desired depth. I.e. not compensating over/underinflated bcd with breath. I usually try to be neutal with rather full lungs, and then sink on exhale and bob back up to neutral on inhale. If I drop to low, I can take really deap breath to float back, and then repeat cycle.</TEXT>

Both regarding tasks performed but also training and equipment. A commercial licensed diver will typically also be qualified for scuba, the reverse is not true. The friends i have doing commercial diving performs a number of tasks like counting fish, monitoring underwater nature preserves, cutting huge ropes from the propellers of container vessels, explore and collect marine shipwrecks for museums, train in submarine rescue, scout bottom conditions for bridge building, check underwater power lines, clear mines and unexploded munitions under water.. the list goes on... none of these are "scuba", even if scuba equipment is used and all require extra training and skillset</TEXT>

Loosing even 1 or 2 zerks from s squad of 8 is really hurting, you need to kill first unit in first combat so you don't get interupted and killed. Then pile into second charge target and kill them to with second activation, keep one model to wrap, use WE strategem for 6" consolidation</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i personally think violent urgency is better, +1" charge makes a huge difference, especially with rerolls. The probability of making an 8" charge is significantly higher. It also give extra movement to get farther up the board! The glaive is to keep warlord alive but packs a reasonable punch for only 5pts (S6, Ap-2,D2)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My apeks-regs can sometimes require some "tuning" after some usage, but not a full service. Basically, a second stage usually contains a rubber diaphragm which is connected to the inner workings of the regulator (purple part in this image [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Diving\_regulator](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Diving_regulator) ) When my regs are freshly serviced they are as fine tuned as can be with regards to breaking resitance etc (basically balancing exactly on the border of not leaking) After some time, the new parts "set" and get worn and they will start to leak (very small leak but still). Then it is just a matter of small adjustment but for a beginner it might seem like a scary task to start tinkering with the gear.</TEXT>

Today I suited up, we did buddy checks, we got on the boat, we jumped in, we got wet (albeit short and my buddy more than me :D ) and got back up in a safe and controlled manner. All steps in n normal rec-dive, this I think it qualifies. I would not say that laying on surface for 10 min, going down for 10 min, coming back up and repeat constitues more dives than 1.

    <TEXT>A normal jacket works fine, but I've seen more divers switch from jacket to bpw than the other direction. In fact, I've never seen a diver switch from bpw back to jacket. Last dive with my club has 12 diver on the boat, logging at least on average 400-500 dives and exactly zero jacket-type BCD:s, to me that speaks in favor of the bpw setup I more or less only do drysuit diving but have done about 50 warm water dives in bpw, it is just better.. Easier to adjust, easier to mount, better trim, better "feel". You can mount single-tank-adapter and smaller wing = gt; perfect for tropical dives or mount bigger wing and twinset for tech-dives and you don't have to re-learn anything, all things are exactly in the same place where you instinctivly know and find them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try to "beg-borrow-steal" different types of equipment from where you get your DM, this will build a knowledge bank of how various equipment work (and does not work) Only ever having used one type of equipment is a bit risky when clients show up with something else. In that case, you cannot immidately tell how their equipment works or if in fact, it is in working order. My vote is sill rubberfins with springstraps for plain durability and manoverbility, but I not sure if they are common in warmer waters. Good luck on your DM-training and if you ever get to the nordic countries, I can show some cold water diving!</TEXT>

I then punched back, killing the CSM, popped strat above (yes, it is my favorite) and consolidated into his next unit behind and killing them as well with second activation. Since my unit didn't charge it can attack anything it ends up within 1" of General CSM * Tide of traitors: bring back a whole unit of culists and redeploy anywhere with 6" from edges and more than 9" from enemy. Suddenly getting 30 cultists behind your lines can be troublesome Astra militarum * Powerlifter sentinel with strat CRUSH THEM! allowing charge after advancing, so with 9" premove, 9"+advance d6" and then charge to tie up some big unit.

    <TEXT>First of all **Paper log vs. digital** There is something rewarding to log on paper in a logbook in the beginning, both from an educational point and also very satisfactory to fill your first logbook. Many divers I know still log on paper after 1500 dives just for this purpose. Also easier with stamps from instuctors, dive masters, tour guides etc. It gives a personal touch to your dive career. Sit down after a dive, have some coffee and refelct on the dive in your head, what was good, what was bad? This accelerates your learning! I transitioned to digital after ca 200 dives, I simply couldn't be bothered haling the logbooks around and keeping track. Also, with better dive computer the ability to have your dive profile together with the dive was a real motivation to go digital. The online solution also supports linking to my dive clubs online logs. (They post all official dives online) I scanned all my logbooks and manually typed every dive into my selected digital solution (see below) and attached the scanned logbook page. This way I still have my historty but can move forward. More benefits with online digital solutions are that you can attach pictures of the dives, get statstics for dive buddies, dive sites, depths etc.. My suggestion is to log your first 50 dives on paper and then see if there is a digital solution that suits you. **Digital solution** I use [https://en.divelogs.de/](https://en.divelogs.de/) Pros: * Available online including all certifications (photo upload section) * Nice statisics * Free * Fairly easy to use * Supports most formats for import of dive * Nice exports to backup-copies (including epub for printing if you need hardcopy) * Subsurface has direct upload to divelogs from application * Connect to buddies also using it Cons: * Bit messy user interface * Mobile app is very poor quality (or at least was when I used it last) * Free (who knows how long it will be supported?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can bullshit, this would need a movement ability to reposition any model after movementphase (Tallarn has tankorder to achive this) So, unless player can point to a rule/ability that allows him to do this, he is cheating. That said, the tallarn ability to shoot and move is intended to be used just like this, expose yourself then retreat into cover/LoS Ratlings have the same ability, they can stay behid coverin ruins, move out in movement, shoot and then move back inside</TEXT>
