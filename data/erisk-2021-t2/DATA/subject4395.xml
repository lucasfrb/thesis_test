    <TEXT>It is called a cast of type. Your url.openConnection() returns a reference of type URLConnection, whereas you want to assign it to the HttpURLConnection variable, a subtype of URLConnection. Since subtype can have additional methods, that are not declared in supertype, you need to cast supertype to a particular subtype. But be careful with casting, you need to be sure that reference you want to cast has correct type. You can check this with instanceof operator. Overall I'd suggest you to limit usage of type casts, to avoid runtime exceptions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mosin-Nagant rifle, Russian 1895 and the obrez use same cartridge, the 7,62x54R. Why do they have separate ammo stacks? In theory having 30 rounds in rifle + 30 in obrez should give us 60 for both. Or it should be 30 rounds for both. Maybe Dice should make it 40-45 cartridges for both weapons?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would be great to have settings synchronization for a profile among different titles (bf4, bfhl, bf1, bf1-cte). Game engine is essentially the same when it comes to the game mechanics settings (sensitivity, USA, keyboard/gamepad layout etc.). Having single settings profile will benefit players that play multiple battlefield titles, and make changes in settings from time to time. E.g. when BF1 was launched I had stick sensitivity = 50, then I've upped it to 60 in BF1, but my old BF4 profile still had 50. When I've started testing CTE it was a default 20, so i had to update it (along with tonnes of others), which was annoying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most 'funny' thing here is the match making. It is often tries to 'balance' the matches you've described by adding new players to the losing team, rather than move people from the winning team to the losing. So new joiner wants to have a good play experience but gets a lot of frustration and quits after 3-5 deaths without impact on a balance.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-29 19:57:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are a lot of primary weapons in Battlefield 1 that have bayonet lug (in fact the majority apart from support, the Hellriegel and maybe a couple of others). During the Great War many of the bayonets were designed to be also hand held when not mounted on the firearm (maybe apart from spike bayonets). My question is why we still don't have a bayonet as a melee weapon? I think it would look cool.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Armored car controls</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-13 06:10:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Platform** Confirmed of PS4, other platforms might be affected too. **Summary** Armored car controls are not affected by vehicle/transport settings in options menu. **Description** Yesterday I was playing on the shooting range testing different classes/vehicles. I'm using custom keybinding for vehicles, based on the Veteran preset (where L2/R2 are used to move backward/forward). For tanks it works perfectly, however Armored vehicle is not using these settings. I've tried to change Transport vehicle settings too, but it didn't help. After a while I found that the car use the same setting as Soldier. **Steps To Reproduce** 1. Login to the shooting range. 2. Change vehicle/transport/soldier control settings 3. Spawn in an armored vehicle **Link To Images Or Videos** No images/videos, as it's easy to reproduce.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Class balance/variation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-15 19:31:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>The majority of the times the choice of the kits people make is Raid Leader + Battle Mechanic + Trench Surgeon + 2 other kits. It makes sense from the team's strength to have one vehicle operator who can self repair, one reviver and one who can deploy portable spawns. However it means that 7 other classes have only two slots and overall variability is poor. To solve that it might be good to rethink class' balance, add new vehicles/leader/reviver classes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure about my rank, I've just started to play on PS4. In my personal observation 90% of the time both teams have the three classes I've mentioned before. Maybe it's just coincidental and real distribution is different. Anyway I think DICE has all the stats about kits popularity so they can tweak balance if needed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bullet hit distribution looks biased to the edge of the spread cone.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-01 12:53:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Platform** Playstation 4 **Summary** Bullet hit distribution looks biased to the edge of the spread cone. **Description** From what i know the spread cone has the size of the inner tips of the crosshair. Also according to the symthic.com the distribution of the hits inside this cone is uniform for non-shotgun weapons. However I've collected an evidence of big bias towards the edge of the cone. Please look at the clip (link below). In the first part I shoot at enemy's head. I've chosen the distance that way that his head takes the majority of the inner crosshair area. Note I'm using playstation zoom feature (square + PS button) to precisely position the crosshair. Sometimes I miss four shots in a row before hitting the head. On the second part I shoot the wall in single fire mode with delays to restore the aim position. The points of impact tend to the edge of the inner crosshair area. On the last series of shooting i even got a circular pattern, not even hitting the center area once. I've raised a ticket on the bug tracker already: https://www.bftracker.com/view.php?id=5259 **Steps To Reproduce** Shoot wall in a single shot mode multiple times and see the pattern. **Link To Images Or Videos** https://youtu.be/TWrpfRMLWK8</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think it can be easily achieved. It all depends on the server tick rate. Now it is about 48~60 hz. Having that big maps like in battlefield with 64 players, vehicles, destructible environment and bullet ballistics requires lots of data to be transferred both ways. Increasing the tick rate will not only increase the amount of data exchanged with the server, but also the load on your PC/console and server.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In BF1 it was quite disappointing when you was able to choose vehicle and it's package only when it becomes available on the spawn, cause you literally didn't have enough time to select what you want before someone simply *steals* it. Then DICE fixed this and let us to select vehicle loadout whenever we want. Now BFV is live and we are starting from the scratch. Why DICE often change things that were good already (usually making them worse)? Could we even expect this will be addressed?</TEXT>
