    <TEXT>I'm currently at 134 billion HC and I'm wondering if there are any fast ways to get to 333 billion HC. I do use garden combos (Queenbeets with Elder frenzy and whatnot) which give me around 10 bil each time I do it. Even that is taking a while and I'm just impatient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>with the javascript console update, i remember it only being around 3 or 4 days to go from beta to live, but seeing how much of an impact the stock market will have on cookie production, it will most likely be a bit longer, due to orteil stating in the patch notes that it may be altered to stop it from being exploited to much.  #8203; i would say give it a week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you can grind "sweet" golden cookies, which give you one lump, from the fthof spell. they're still quite rare, but a lot more common than naturally spawning one. i recommend using the fortune cookie add-on ( [https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/FortuneCookie.js](https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/FortuneCookie.js) ) which shows the outcomes of the fthof spell. so what i do is i see if there is a sweet gc coming soon, and if there is, i just use a bunch of spells until i get to it. if there's not, i ascend, which changes the fthof outcomes, and hope for a sweet gc in the fthof spell.</TEXT>
