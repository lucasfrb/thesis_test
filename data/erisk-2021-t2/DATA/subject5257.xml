    <TEXT>I've only made really bad games with scratch and using Java script coding(have to code all the images with draw functions in Java script) but G.I.M.P. is an AMAZING program- I use it all of the time for pixel art and I use it to make GIFs, you just need to know what you're doing and how to navigate the program. Best part is IT'S 100% FREE! And if you need something that's not built in to the program, it has a built in script editor, so people are constantly making addons for it. If you need help with it, I can help you. Its quite easy but hard to find a tutorial on, but once I figured it out, I was so good at using the program I even taught the class clown/ idiot (my friend in my computer class with a teacher who doesn't even know what a keyboard shortcut is- no joke) how to make full fledged pixel GIFs with the program.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I starve myself a lot just because i feel like a burden to those who love me- but i find it difficult to do so because they try and take care of me and try to make me eat. On top of that i have a psychiatrist appointment monthly and he always records my weight bc i was under weight untill not too long ago but in the past maybe two weeks I've lost a lot of weight and now im probably under weight again. This was totally worthless info but that's my two cents (more like one cent its so worthless)</TEXT>

It may not be the best choice, commiting suicide, but it sure as heck would be mine if i were you. Im so sorry you had to go through so much pain.

I hope it's better for you on the other side. It hurts me so much that you or anyone else has to feel such pain, i know what it's like to hurt and i wish no one ever had to again. I would even take everyone's pain for myself if i could, just so that i might be able to fix this terrible world. Blessings and i will remember you when i pray, so hopefully you might make it to wherever it is your faith says you want to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sounds like a fantasy! Except id make my death bloodier and last longer. Id start out by first cutting open my ankles and my wrists, allowing a pool of blood to soak me throughout the whole process. Then id stat cutting, and cutting, and cutting- only making sure to avoid my arteries, prolonging the pain. then id stab out my left eye, leaving my good eye so i can still see. After more cutting and bleeding, when i begin to get weak, I'll start cutting the arteries on all my limbs, except my right arm. Afterwards I'd slit my thought then, while enjoying the sight of all the blood, I'd stab and I'd stab and stab untill i can't stab my fucking heart anymore. The only thing keeping me from doing this is the fear that i won't be able to enjoy the sane pain inn the afterlife- whether i go to heaven or hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FFF (FUCK FAKE FRIENDS!!!). SCREW THOSE FUCKING ASSHOLES!!! STICK UP FOR YOURSELF!!! I had a friend who's only real friends were me and a girl, her other 'friends' were assholes and bitches! One girl called her a slut for no dam reason numerous times, most of her 'friends' called her ugly all the time (if it means anything i thought she was the most beautiful person in the world and had a huge crush on her+ she was the best friend i ever had). She was really skinny but super self conscience and believed it when those assholes called her fat. Both me and her were bullied in school("trash", "garbage", "losers", "stupid", "ugly"). She never stood up for herself so i had to stand up for her(i don't give a crap what others think or say about me- for the most part). Until she left and did homeschooling instead, she self harmed and would call herself names cause she liked feeling worthless. Now she doesn't care anymore, she's now come out as bisexual, and she even stopped self harming. Don't call them your friends and especially don't listen to any shit they say about you. (Next time someone insults you, say thank you. It will profoundly confuse them and it's really funny. That's what i do and it always makes me laugh, even when it doesn't confuse them i just sound like a stupid idiot)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't know them too well but it's still upsetting. And that's the thing- why is it upsetting. Io what it's like to want to kms. I even question why anybody would want to stop suicide- it's nothing but relief. I think it might be because he died due to suicide though, and not something else. Because I'm suicidal. Because ik it's gonna happen to me... *and hopefully soon*... On top of that it kinda makes me not want to commit suicide due to the pain. But on the other hand it's extremely triggering at the same time- more triggering than out would be for most because almost nothing can trigger me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>... People are weird ........ Its prob like YouTube- if you haven't been doing it for a long time no one will notice you because people only watch what they know they like. Not brows for new content. If you do it for lounger more purple will see your posts then the more your posts are seen the more people will see it. It's the messed up way social media works- it makes it impossible for new comers to be noticed, at least for quite a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My whole life I've been so depressed only cats make me feel actual joy. Yah, i have had fun and laughed and felt happy. But the only tone i feel generic joy(no suicidal thoughts or pain, more than just a thin half hearted smile on my face), is when i have a cat. It makes me feel so much joy. And being that i don't usually feel that good, it just makes me feel even happier. Idk what I'm gonna do without my precious kitty! She's really old and may not last too much longer in as good of health she's in. I think I'm gonna finally kms when she's gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i skimmed through your post (Sorry i couldn't concentrate enough to read the whole thing- i have ADHD) and i can understand how your feeling to Ann extent. I'm still a teen, growing up in the lower middle class (i think); i have autism, depression, ADHD, self diagnosed insomnia, and maybe even ocd. I've self harmed and been suicidal my whole life. I have (had) a grate family (sadly most of witch have died). I never had to starve, I've always has nice clothes and a roof over my head. I do well in school but i still feel suicidal. I guess im just kinda ranting because all i can say to help you Is that i think you need a psychiatrist. They can help you with prescription drugs. I'm no doctor but maybe you should try a lower dose of whatever you were on because you said you were unnaturally happy- just a guess. If you need to vent I'm usually a much better listener- it's just my medication hasn't kicked in yet. If you don't have a pet it could be really therapeutic to get one- if it weren't for my cat I'd probably be dead rn. Hope you get better and I'm here if you need to vent.</TEXT>

I can't make you feel better, but if you hang in there it will get better. If you can, it might be helpful fyi find a grief support group- idk if they exist for adults(the ones ik of are dedicated to children, but also help the children's parents), but try to find some support. Maybe a therapist or something. Ik how it is to loos a loved one- i watched my grandmother die and not too long ago my mom and brother died in a car accident. My aunt died a few years ago too. you're not alone and there are people who can help you with your grieving. Please find someone to help you- it will make life so much better for you sooner.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>LG-K3, online games don't work</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 05:30:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i have a trashy LG-K3 android phone and I'm having problems with online games- it seems to be limited to live ones(CoC works just fine but this problem occurs with Among us and Clash Royal). The problem is that whenever i play a live online multiplayer game it always (and i mean *ALWAYS*) crashes at some random time after about 2-3 mins. have already passed. I also can't find and haven't gotten the chance to get an sd- so storage isn't easy to work with. On the other hand this problem doesn't have to do with storage because when I'm not in need of it i keep the play store uninstalled. I tried force stopping and updating the programs(they didn't need an update and Google play store was up to date). The problem also started occurring after i had only just booted up each game literally seconds after it finished installing. Hard and soft resetting my phone didn't work and no messing around with storage space or the play store did anything. On top of that my internet is never having problems when this happens. This is all that the internet was able to help me with to trouble shoot the problem, pls help. And *thank you* in advance  #183;u #183;</TEXT>

If you want a painful one do something slow like make yourself bleed to death without cutting any major veins/ arteries or hang/ drown yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you live in America, I'm gonna tell you this now- cops are worthless. Yah there are some good cops, but at least were i live the cops don't give a fuck about shit. Ok, maybe my neighborhood is pretty getto, but it's not like racism exists here- most people here are white and no racist person would live here because even though most of my city is white, we're on the border of flipping Mexico!!! Here the cops are just total shit. The problem here is just an insane amount of homeless drug attics. I got my bike stolen off my back porch and heroin needles are everywhere. The problem is that there are too many problems here for the cops to give a crap or for anyone who cares to become one. We got problems with there being too much need for more police because all the real cops are retired and all the people who didn't know what a cop was quit. The point is, if your neighborhood is anything like mine the cops don't give a crap and aren't even real cops, no matter what year it is. Cops are worthless and won't do shit unless your calling them to catch a person who is currently trying to rob you. Loitering and breaking and entering don't exist- just robbery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was the weird kid... I'll never forget the day i learned to fling paper clips. in middle school the whole school except the two basketball courts was indoors- one building cause it was a small school. I could flick a paper clip so hard the bang it made when it hit the back of my locker echoed through the whole hall way(a little longer than three class rooms long- i think class rooms are all about the same size). I also got in trouble a few times for flicking paper clips across the hall- there was a class room at the end of the hall and i could flick a paper clip to the point were it almost slid all the way to the back wall of it from the other end of the hall. I also got in trouble for flinging my rubber bracelets and fighting with them rather than paying attention(i didn't yet know i had ADHD). Took me years to learn i never fit in due to my autism. I was the class weirdo and literally no one but the really nice or the friendless/ other total outcasts wanted to be around me. I was also annoying af because i love anything annoying(like Nyan cat), making me immune, and i love annoying others. I was really weird</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a young teen (prefer not to share my exact age) and i do a lot to self harm. Rn I'm just worried about my most recent problem- i started starving my self as self harm(although it never hurt because i made young me be able to go long periods without food- not as self harm). I've been starving myself allot lately and it's gotten to the point were a medium sized homemade quesadilla is enough to last me an entire day. My stomach is so small I literally never feel hungry and I think i might have some sort of mineral deficiency because it's not uncommon for me to go temporarily blind when i stand up. Is this gonna start causing me brain damage or cause some sort of long term/ permanent damage to my body?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If by "blacking out" you mean pushing out I'm not, it's just that occasionally when i stand up I'll go blind for a few seconds and get a little dizzy. It takes me a moment to lose vision throughout all of my vision if i do. Its not risk blindness though, I'll see insanely bright fuzz throughout my vision.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ik it's not completely confidential- if i say I'm self harming or having suicidal thoughts confidentiality is terminated (but fam. found out recently anyways, i just can't bring myself to talk about it with anyone who has the ability to, or will, do anything about it). Edit: its also not me looking for control or anything, i just hate myself more than the poor kid sitting next to me in class does(unless it's my bff, no one wants to be near me in class). I wish to kms in the most painful way possible when I'm no longer needed here by my family so i can suffer for all I've done wrong. That's why i SH- to make myself suffer. When it's not to suffer its to take my hate out- my hate for myself and any hate for anything else. When I'm triggered SH is the only thing that makes me feel better (i read an article once that explained an experiment showing people who cut has less hormones that cause happiness [or whatever it was] in their spinal cord fluid tan people who didn't and that it released that hormone[or whatever] into. introvert bodies when they cut. I'll try to find the link if i can).</TEXT>
