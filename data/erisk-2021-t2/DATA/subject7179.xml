    <TEXT>I've gotten this amp at a local garage sale. I never had a tube amplifier before, so i thought this would be a quite interesting project to take on. [Image of before](http://i.imgur.com/syTW2.jpg) After buying I've been reading allot on the Internet the basic principles and such, about tube amplifiers. Started rebuilding the amplifier and gave it a little paint job. I've replaced all capacitors, renewed almost all resistors, replaced a couple of volume pots. also all the tubes had seen better days so i replaced them, The Russian 6P14P-EB for the EL84 and the ECC83's replaced with 6N2P-EV What do you guys think of my first project ? * Edit, why isn't the imgur link embedded into my post ? the photo should have been [Finnished](http://i.imgur.com/PDeCx.jpg)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-02-08 19:34:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hope someone can point me in the right direction here. The story : I have a Kontakt KT-7 Amplifier. Class A Single ended with EL84. Now i live in a apartment complex and no matter how i turn Bass/Treble the bass was just too much. There for i create a tone-bypass. The signal wire comes directly into the ECC83. [I've drawn the new situation](http://imgur.com/o2W7R5r) (Only one channel shown) So yeah, high and mid's are sounding better than ever before! The problem. Now i have too less bass. I suspect the cutoff frequency isn't right. Can someone point me out what's wrong in my little modification? I suspect i need bigger capacitor. Even tho.. 680nF should be enough? Or did i screw it up somewhere else? and if indeed capacitor. which value should be sufficient enough? Hope there are some tube guru's lurking on here who wanna teach the new generation something Thanks! ** The red long line is literally where i cut off the signal from the tone control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Little back story. Many years I've smoked weed on quite a regular basis. Only thing is,.. two widely known side-effects that i didn't seem to have. I don't get red eyes nor do i get " eating kicks" I never really thought anything off it. Till recent... I got diagnosed with ADD Im on dex-amphetamine for that. It does everything i expected it to be doing. Except... my appetite has been much much more than all those years I've been smoking weed? How is that possible? that (in my case) some side-effects totally the opposite of what's normal reaction of the body to the substance?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, i have scripting experience within a few other engines (mostly BI with their RV engines, SQF syntax) I want to start scripting a few small modification for GTA V, Mostly the police AI behavior. They annoy me! It could definitely be allot more fun if police acted more,.. police like. Aggressiveness AI (just plain stupid and reckless) also their deployment of resources. And i want to force deployment spawning @ police buildings instead of where ever the fuck they want. Might become a little problematic concerning large distances. might take a hit on performance but for players with high-end rigs it should be a minimal impact i think how does the structure work within GTA. Can someone provide me a good resource based guide I googled some but i couldn't find what i was looking for. I need to learn their scripting language still searching for some good resources on that. Could someone point me in the right direction?</TEXT>

Avoid processed food amp;drinks! * *2* |Medication is not the answer it's merely a *tool.* * *3* |One should really start reading about Zinc, Magnesium,Vitamin B6/B12/Complex. * *4* |Physical Exercise. This one is always something rather important but for AD(H)D. Even more important! In combination with healthy dietary. (Brain chemistry, Metabolism) * *5* |Find a way in dealing with stress. With that i mean finding a way of raising stress tolerance. Besides dealing with the actual problem. Dietary  amp; exercise is already a good start. For me i found **Binaural beats** rather effective as a effective easy tool. * *6* |See it as a gift, not as a curse. Yes we suck at some things the world around us views as common tasks. But, Ever noticed how passionate you can be? And how quickly you are able to learn, acquire skills in those conditions. Find it and use it * *7* |**Break the clock** I mean literally. just drop the whole (Live for today plan for tomorrow) 24h mind lock. We all do it without realizing it till one day abruptly we snap out off it. It blew my mind back in the day that i was doing that for so long without realizing it.

    <TEXT>We all know the bug concerning Quite and some missions (49 i thought) But i encountered a new one which completely destroyed my savegame :( It happend to me while i was doing a side-op " Extract the legendary gunsmith yet again" When launched, the chopper disappeared and i am hovering in the air. While a crashing noise is playing like my chopper has just been shot down. Luckily i backed up my savegames manually. I was able to reproduce this crash. Turns out if you customize the helicopter with another paint job. This will happen. If you are in this crash. NEVER RETURN to motherbase. If you do this you are not able to use "Return to ACC" in the ESC menu While on mission and stuck in the air subscribed above. Press ESC, Return to ACC. In ACC "Customize" Remove the paint job. Exit it game, Launch again. Continue the mission and it will behave normally.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Metal Gear Solid: Integral PC (Modified up-scaled and gfx enhancenment W10/W8 compatible) (W.I.P)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-06 14:05:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Update 1-6-16** **I've released an complete package available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/4m1hv2/metal_gear_solid_1_pc_w10w81_x86_xinputfullscreen/)** -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original post : Hello, Recently i found Metal Gear Solid Integral for PC At the local thrift store. It actually installed on my W10 64b system to my surprise. First problem was the videocard. Game would not execute due to a magical video-card with abnormal characteristics it scared the living hell out of the engine. At one point i think the game engine mentioned "Do you run nasa shit?" /S That can be fixed with a NO-CD executable modded to suite Radeon/Nvidia cards Second problem. No full screen only max 1024x resolution, no usb input, user data saving behaves dodgy. I've been hard at work since yesterday and I've managed to drastically improve visuals. Up scaling to native resolution monitor, Full screen non windowed. Better lighting and clarity. It looks less blurry. Instead of relying on DX7 I've managed to mod it to use OpenGL instead. My question is, before i put much more hours into this. Would people here be interested in playing Metal Gear Solid Integral on their modern w8/w10 machines? [Teasers images](http://imgur.com/a/HiBoe) To-do : * Fix visual clipping * Fix load/save non-default user settings * Fix USB input (seems to have a problem with non PS/2 devices) * Enable 30fps instead of 24fps framelock (*if possible) * Degrain rendering I'm curious to hear if anyone would like to play this oldie again! -7/3- * added small status update in comments * Edit: OpenGL is off the table, now the broker is directly talking to DX10! Which should enable the use of Xinput for the x360 controller * **Edit2 : Initial release attempt in comments!**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Final Full release] Metal Gear Solid 1 Integral PC [1080p/Xinput Controller Support/DX10.1]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-30 14:11:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>**4-3-2019 Please stop sending private messages and/or chat(s)** I won't respond to questions anymore concerning MGS1 Integral I have answered for a long time to mostly low effort messages, It's been almost 3 years now. Still receiving questions on a weekly (or even daily) basis. 1. Instead of asking me how to mount an ISO, google it instead. 2. Instead of asking me how to connect some controller, google it instead. 3. Black screen? Update driver or well it's just bad luck it's not gonna work for you Or read the comments down below they'll answer most of the questions. I won't provide any further support. Sorry **9-14-2016 Added Reverse Engineering Resources Down below** Final Release of my Project Metal Gear Solid 1 Integral for PC Playable on current hardware and operating systems Since Metal Gear Solid 1 was unplayable on modern machines I felt compelled to keep this oldie alive and well,since It has long been abandoned nor available anymore on the market I wanted to preserve a piece of gaming history. It would be a shame if it disappeared completely! Therefor I #8217;ve spend a few months working on this in my sparetime With the help of /r/metalgearsolid community members their feedback I've been able to work out most of the gamebreaking bugs/issues/glitches And now it #8217;s time to present my final release, I won #8217;t be actively working on this project from now on. I will however try to support if any issues arise. **DOWNLOAD:** **[Full installer package](https://mega.nz/#!RUIhAYgb!3zaMbIkkIuQJDAZ2W0fTSkmALaXx9T-4PD-whKp26A4)** -Mega.nz [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/UTlKI) *Requirements* * Operating system: Windows /8/10 with DirectX11and/or higher installed. * Hardware: **Dedicated GPU** supporting DirectX feature level 10.1 with at least 1GB Vram * Software: **[DirectX end-user runtime from June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)** * Might be needed depending upon software/hardware configuration (If game crashes/doesn't launch) 1.Microsoft visual c++ 2005 2.Microsoft visual c++ 2008 3.Microsoft visual c++2012 4.Microsoft visual c++2013 *Notes* * On first run set highest resolution possible in game menu (Option  #8594; video/sound  #8594; Advanced) * Disk 1 Error: Try one or more of these following solutions: 1) Insert a flash drive when the game says 'Insert Disk 1'. Make sure that there are no other USBs connected to the computer as this creates conflicts. You may have to experiment with different ports to make the game work. 2) If you have a CD/DVD drive, throw a random CD/DVD into the drive. 3) Change the mgsi.exe file compatibility to Win98/WinME. 4) Use a random ISO 5) If all else fails, use the original ISO's (Rare bug) * Choppy framerate (4k screen issue): You will have to change compatibility settings for the mgsi.exe file. Right click mgsi.exe and go to Properties and then the Compatibility tab. Click on 'Run in 640x480 screen resolution' and 'Run as administrator' then click 'Apply'. This would make the game run at a smooth 30 fps. (Cannot go higher because of PS1 architecture.) * Retail CD owners, can Install using original game CD, Download this package and install in same directory * Forced upscaling to 1080p * Ingame screenshot(s) with PrtScn key, Image will be saved in gamefolder * Verified support for PS3 /Xbox Controller (PS4 controller only after PS3 emulation) * Don #8217;t let Nvidia/AMD software profile this game (Due to manipulation of HW GPU, The game thinks it #8217;s running on an Geforce Ti4800) *Changelog* From V0.02 - gt; Final * various minor compatibility fixes * updates source renderer/HW API * various minor fine tuning renderer parameters * GPU HW/Software emulation fixes related to scale/aspect ratio * There was a something wrong with the game splash screen.

    <DATE>2016-08-11 18:58:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope my thread meets criteria of this subreddit. If not please let me know and I'll remove it. I'm bored and It's a rainy day. I want to watch a movie which will leave me with a feeling that it changed my perspective on something. The current day movies playing in cinema, don't excite me at all. Just easy entertainment, surely a lot of people do enjoy those movies but i genuinely don't. Recently I watched, [Magnolia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/) for example It's about the even and odds and changes in life. I did enjoy that movie I Enjoyed [Eyes Wide Shut](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) I like mystery and the occult. It's more or less fictive but with a element of truth within our society. A truth that killed the man behind this movie most likely Without going through a whole list of movies I like and didn't like I think you guys get the point. Something that will grasp my breath and will make my head hurt afterwords. Like your whole perspective on life just changed. Doesn't matter in which way, postive exciting, saddening depressing, scary or haunting. As long if it tells me something, a hidden truth. It also may be a Documentary</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-22 15:55:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I wonder if anyone saw the utter strange interaction last night. Between 'Skynet' who most of us already know and other user named 'Osmosis' There was something off I never seen anything quite like it on Wargame sidechat. Even the constant BS from bots/spammers seem to be put off by their interaction. Today I keep thinking about it what they said it seemed to me like coded language. Like high-level MIL talks or I don't know what to make of it. Even tho they didn't say any awful things which is usual on sidechat, It was for me somehow the most scary and haunting interaction I've ever seen on sidechat Has anyone seen it? What would it be just some silliness or was something happening there? What do you think? And did anyone make screenshots?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can Anyone Tell Me What I'm Pulling Out Of My Body?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-04 16:12:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope anyone call tell me what I'm looking at here and if i should visit a doctor. Little backstory: A few days ago, I saw a strange little irritated spot, I thought an ingrowth hair. I used a needle to open it up but while I did so it made a odd sound, like pulling velcro. While poking around i could feel this tension underneath the skin, reminded me of elastic fibers Before i knew it i was pulling out fiber like material, they kinda look like hair but something is different. It's very sticky seemingly almost magnetic, It's rather difficult to get them off my tweezers/needle But it won't easily stick to plastics for example (I was trying to put those odd hairlike fibers in a little plastic container) I was pulling them out for a good 20 minutes without any pain what so ever nor did it bleed much After I was left with a cavity underneath my skin, like a sinkhole. the cavity entrance is at least 3mm under the skin, and the hole left is at least 2cm deep I really didn't know what to make of it, but I choose the most comforting theory I could think off. ingrowth hair. But, it was still in the back of my mind. Today after showering I spotted the same kind of weird looking small irritated spot. This time near my neck. (the previous one was on my upper-leg) Again, i grabbed my tweezers amp;needle and again it went exactly the same. the velcro noises the fibers and another pothole But this time, I was determined to collect as much as I could of those weird hair like fibers [Gallery @ Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/ziNSv) * Age : Mid 20's * Sex : Male * Height : 6'2 / 190cm * Weight : 198lbs / 90kg EDIT: As requested the wound 'sinkhole' [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/cPirm) EDIT 3/17: Oops, forgotten to tell what it actually was! It was an sort of cyst containing vellus hair I'm not sure if it's the correct clinical name *Eruptive vellus hair cysts (EVHCs) (*Kinda sounded the same as what I was told by the doctor in my native language)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-26 16:09:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>A year back or so I made an password protected Rar archive of some former projects of mine. You guessed it! I've lost the password to that archive. I'm sure I'd written it down somewhere... Last few days I've been guessing and checking off countless attempts. But than it hit me... I've created that archive on this machine. even winrar hasn't been updated since. I remember that someone told me once that Winrar stores the password(s) used to create (and/or open) archives on the hostmachine's OS registry. (Win10 in my case) Does anyone know anything about this? Is this true? That it stores the key in the reg of the host-machine who's owner of the file if that's true than where's it stored exactly? It would be lovely is that's the case. I don't particularly look forward on brute-forcing (I'm pretty sure I've used 8 chars with uppercase's and numbers)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>WD 1TB USB Drive | WD10JMVW Odd symptom(s)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-31 22:38:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, This drive in his encasing has been dropped. Im trying to recover it for a friend of mine I'm kinda confused what's going on exactly with the drive. When I connect it The LED indicator is blinking, yet randomly it becomes steady. (connected to host) When that happens I can actually see the drive in Explorer even the files and folders. When I try to make a copy to a healthy drive it starts acting funny. The data transfer is very slow. 300kb/s for a few seconds and it drops to 0 kb/s for ussually a longer period (LED starts blinking again) Maybe 15sec later LED comes on permanently again and it continues copying files. This time the speed could be 3kb/s for example. This cycle continues forever Making direct image of the drive to a healthy drive near impossible Anyone faced this kind of oddness before? If so, what are the likely culprits? PS. I tested another SS USB cable, and tried multiple USB3 ports. All with exactly the same result Also I get the impression that the drive is senstive regarding how i hold it. upside down/ on it's side seems to aid/worsen the symptom (But that could be just me) I have a suspicion that it's the RV sensor on the PCB. That it somehow become defective due to the fall and still under the impression that it's in freefall? If that's possible? If so, how do these little bastards work. Could I for example desolder it and jump wire it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Another Case that Fits the Bill [Nicky Verstappen, age 11, 1998]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-12 10:32:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Literal translation of Dutch Police case description: Netherlands, Brussum, August 1998. In the night of Sunday 9 on Monday 10 august 1998 Nicky Verstappen dissapeared. From summercamp on the  #8216;Brunsummerheide #8217; (forest) where he with 36 other children from the surrounding area  #8220;Heibloem #8221; were staying. The next evening his body was found, 1200m/ 1007ft from the camp One of the boys from the tent Nicky was sleeping in recalled that he spoken with Nicky 6:30am When Nicky got up to go to the toilet. Later discovered that his shoes were still in the tent. It was not something Nicky was known for, walking away. Let alone bare footed. Early morning the camp leaders raised the alarm, police and parents of Nicky were contacted. The hours that followed police and camp leaders didn #8217;t find any trace of Nicky. In the afternoon Nicky was officially declared missing. The search grid got extended and additional units were called upon In the evening and night the search continued, the hope of finding Nicky alive and well grew smaller by the hour. More than 200 people showed up the next morning to continue the search for Nicky. That included staff from the summer-camp, police units, **US military units** from the nearby headquarters of AFCENT (Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum) As well civilians from the direct surroundings showed up for the search of Nicky. Around 9pm that evening the body of Nicky was found. Dead, but without any signs of violence, unknown cause of death. barefooted and only wearing his pajamas pants. His body was located in a very dense, dark conifer forest. His feet were clean. A location where a child wouldn't dare venture off in the dark of the night My personal reasoning why it's relevant: Nicky's body was found not even a mile away. While they've been near earlier, not even the K9's picked up a scent. His feet were clean. No signs of him traveling the distance between camp/body location. Officially there is no cause of death. No signs of any kind of trauma, no certain signs of sexual abuse. No traces in his blood of any substances. On his body there was a small amount of DNA found. The police has launched a massive DNA matching campaign with more than 15.000 DNA samples from people who've been anywhere near the camp. Non matched, not even a partial match. Till this day it's a case that's been actively investigated. A specialized team their sole purpose is Nicky's case.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Manon Seijke 8 years old left her home barefooted. body found 6 months later in wooded area near a river 500ft from her home [1995, Netherlands]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-12 15:44:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>My first submission was the case of [Nicky verstappen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Missing411/comments/6t7rnx/another_case_that_fits_the_bill_nicky_verstappen/) (Will get relevant down below) Netherlands, Eindhoven august 10, 1995. 8 year old Manon Seijke Manon Seijke, asked her mom if it was alright to go and play outside in the afternoon, left her house without shoes. She never came home.In the hours after around 8pm the initial large scale search party was formed. Police and neighbors with the help of a airplane and helicopter. Time goes by, not days not even weeks but months. 6 months later. 17 February 1996 A hiker walking his dog not even half a mile away for Manon's home. His dog suddenly ran off went into the wooded area. The hiker followed, this is where the body was discovered by the hiker The odd thing is, that area has been searched often. Even on the first evening of her disappearing According to those involved in the search it was impossible to miss a body (sources in links) Sources and more detailed information: A. http://misdaaddossier.nl/manon-seijkens/ [Translated by Google](https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl amp;tl=en amp;js=y amp;prev=_t amp;hl=nl amp;ie=UTF-8 amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmisdaaddossier.nl%2Fmanon-seijkens%2F amp;edit-text= amp;act=url) B. https://dnadatabank.wordpress.com/dossiers/manon-seijkens/ [Translated by Google](https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl amp;tl=en amp;js=y amp;prev=_t amp;hl=nl amp;ie=UTF-8 amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdnadatabank.wordpress.com%2Fdossiers%2Fmanon-seijkens%2F amp;edit-text= amp;act=url) Case details are worth reading, some very distinct familiarities with the other case(s) Personal notes why I think this case might relevant as well: * Coincidentally this happened on the 10th of august as well. Just like Nicky in 1998 * She left her home without shoes, which was unlike her. Again just like Nicky, who left his shoes back in the tent. * The area where the body is found was very near the place she went missing. Just like Nicky. * The place where she was found was searched even in the hours after she's been reported missing * Again a vague link towards the USA, a witness was flown in from the United States, Feb 1999. (No indications whom that person might be and what the link is) Edit: Oops, can't edit the title but I meant around 500 yd instead of ft Europe... I'm used to metric system</TEXT>

[Listen amp;watch to this audio book segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRz3deg1crY) from the Twin Peaks Series (3:59) I would recommend watching the TV series first, [Season 1 amp;2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/?ref_=nv_sr_2) After watch the [Twin Peaks - Fire walk with me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/?ref_=nv_sr_1) movie. Last but not least Watch [Season 3 of Twin Peaks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4093826/?ref_=nv_sr_1) Which started this year, almost 26 years later.

    <TEXT>A friend factory wiped his device (Oppo R5) under the impression that it would clean just the android system, leaving personal files intact. Which it doesn't... (except SDcard) I've dealt with such cases before on older android devices, all successfully. Gain root, Sideload CWM  amp; Busybox with ADB. use DD to create raw image of block device. Recover lost files on computer with data acquisition toolset(s) This time everything went well except for the last step. I can't recover anything at all from the phone's NAND. not even when using a file craver. Refuse to believe that the whole /userdata partition has been scrubbed clean with zeros under Factory Reset. Check the partition image with a hex editor. the unallocated space is a 00-00-00-00-00 galore. As a last effort I've changed the SE kernel to permissive, thinking maybe Android SE has been using some new counter measure voodoo. Made another DD image, sadly same result. Anyone dealt with this before? Is there something I'm missing? Any tricks/tips? Or has Android really stepped up their file system game</TEXT>

I gently started throwing papers out of the box while getting more nervous each and every second. Something green... wtf! Ok nope nope lets just get the gasoline and lighter! I do not want to deal with this shit Luckily I didn't turns out besides the item I ordered I've gotten a free pet! A very young Iguana. It was weakened and near starvation.

To do that it uses all kinds of resources ranging from analogue sensory to low level hardware events. With this information from all subsystems it essentially creates a baseline which is used for a sanity checks. It will be aware that something is different, but not necessary knows what it is exactly wrong or causing it. But does enable it to report which subsystem is acting different than usual Kinda like we do, we know our foot hurts badly.

    <TEXT>Mine lady is painfully honest coupled with a very strong sense of justice and fairness and darn stubborn. I call her my Princess Diana Because she kinda reminds me of Princess Diana, besides her name is actually Diana. I don't see it as a negative quality but the outside world does every now and than. It gets her in trouble sometimes She has been fired on multiple occasions because she went against the board/manager/boss. Speaking her mind freely and acting upon her words. Each and every time it was for a good reason unfairness or injustice towards the consumer/client/co-worker whom ever I admire her fearlessness even tho some would call it reckless. I admire her willingness to self-sacrifice for a cause she truly believes in, some would call it foolish. She can be a huge pain in the ass when I am lying to myself, keep telling myself a comfortable truth. She'll roll over my comfortable bubble with a tank. And not because she wants to hurt me or anyone else, it comes honest and with good intension It does hurt tho, badly. Worse than when someone does it just to hurt the other. But she does force me to grow as a individual which I'm thankful for. Even if it means receiving a powerful punch in the face once in a while so be it.</TEXT>

When done with flashing. Use ADB to issue a reboot to recovery command. From that point you can install the ROM from TWRP on the device itself A warning tho, if things go bad.. it's impossible to restore device without a working USB port PS. If the USB port is broken, how do you charge the phone than? If it's just a bad contact meaning charging works but no data/com it's often due to filthy usb port contacts. Use a very tin cut-out piece of plastic + toilet paper + Isopropyl alcohol or WD40 and very gently rub the soaked paper along the USB contacts. Often it's enough to restore data connection</TEXT>

    <TEXT>vegan much healthier I doubt that. All vegans I know (3) are female and around my age. Coincidentally all of them, their skin looks way older/unhealtier than mine. Their hair became rather thin Also all 3 of them complain about not having any energy and always feeling tired. They also collectively complain about mood swings, depression and unable to cope with stress/fear. Getting spooked easily And to top it off, their body fat proportion seems odd. They went from having a healthy amount of female curves to completely flat but with a puffy face. Yet I just listen and act as if it's 'odd' Since when you point out the obvious..

    <TITLE>FTL v4.0 Lost Connection to API | Ubuntu 16.04 LTS [Fix]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-23 09:42:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday my server fetched some distro updates. After a reboot, suddenly the FTL engine (DNSmasq) wouldn't respond. At first, I thought well lets do the good old Pihole -R (Repair/Reconfig) Often that does the trick rather well. But sadly even after rebooting the system the problem was still there  gt; sudo service pihole-FTL status Presented an issue with the IP adress already being in use. Which baffled me, it kinda means a second dnsmaq was running (without me being able to see the process somehow...) Long story short, in the end what fixed it after hours and hours of digging into config files (without success) The solution was rather simple!  gt; sudo apt-get remove dnsmaq -y (Will also remove dnsmaq-base)  gt; sudo apt-get install dnsmaq  gt; sudo reboot  gt; pihole -r Done. It works again Likely others will run into this issue after a recent ubuntu update in the coming days/weeks. Try this! Might save you some sanity, and hours of frustration No idea why this rather simple 'solution' worked, My suspicion is that there is some file permission issue after distro update.</TEXT>

The local industry is being run by different groups of men between the age of 30~60. Most of them come across as very polite, pleasant and respectable. I think they've been able to keep this enterprise going for so long due to the fact that they are very disciplined, organized. The behavior  amp; conduct of a legit industry, not drawing any unnecessary attention You won't see anything shady when visiting, just a lovely little town. Only if you live here long enough you'll start to connect the dots</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kinda happened to me the other way around (white male, foreign kids) Back in 2015 I was walking with my dogs to the beach. At the beach there were a few Syrian refugee kids They were instantly drawn to my dogs. Wanted to hug/pet my dog Luckily I know my dog is fine with small kids. I was surprised the oldest girl (13 or so) could speak English rather well. "Can I and my little brothers walk with you and the dog?" -Sure! Go ask your parents if that's alright with them Girl ran back to her parents who were sitting on a bench. She came running back smiling "They said yes!" I looked at their parents, they nodded at me "It's fine" So I and a bunch of Syrian children went on a little hike with the dog. They really seemed to enjoy it. 15 minutes later or so suddenly the police confronted me and what I was doing with these kids... They had a call someone reported that "I took those children" Man, some folks are really cold hearted. Those kids were enjoying playing  amp; walking with my dog and now this, I could clearly see the kids getting frightened, nervous. I can imagine, coming from a war torn country that they really don't like the sight of 6 armed police officers swarming us Luckily the parents saw the altercation happening They came running towards us, and we explained the whole situation. I was just being polite and nice to the children. No attempted kidnapping. Yet, I still felt bad for those kids. They seemed really unsettled by the whole incident The youngest was truly petrified. It was suppose to be a nice thing for them till some jack-ass ruined their day at the beach. with one false call</TEXT>

But what really pissed me off, that someone would be so foul so full of hatred. That they actually proceed sabotaging something nice and innocent. I'm not sure of course but I do believe it's due to the kids being foreign. I'm not easily enraged but this did it. I managed to keep my cool tho, to not further upset the kids. After I just felt saddened for those children. They seemed so happy and carefree playing with the dogs How children should be feeling always, safe and free.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. I was in the process of moving in a new apartment. My seemingly new neighbor kinda invited himself to the party I didn't ask this stranger to help me out. But okay sure extra hands are always handy when moving into a new place! Till this day he's still often to be found in my apartment. Me as a somewhat introvert, I would never do that... I mean I would help people, but when it's done I'm gone. Not that I would invite myself over for diner and set up shop on his couch. Like we've known each other for a entirety. while I'm pretty sure I've never seen the dude in question before... But I do admire him for that. And we make a great team</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Concerning dying GPU's within 1-2 yr(s) I spotted a trend, often those folks have a small-ish case without decent airflow. Which certainly contributes to degradation of the video-card. VRAM/VRM/Caps are the first to die in such cases The R290 was such a card as well. Many folks reporting defects within the first year While others used the same GPU for 5 years without a single issue Like me, my previous R290 is still alive and well!

This could prolong the lifespan of the graphics card. undervolting not necessary to do, but wouldn't harm. One thing I did forget to tell. A very simple thing which would certainly benefit the card in the long-term. Some folks play a demanding game for a few hours. Exit the game and power off the machine right away. Don't, just let it sit idle for 10 minutes or so before turning it off</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-30 15:35:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I started initial tests of a tool previously unknown to me. [JPEG Recovery LAB](https://www.disktuna.com/download-jpeg-recovery-lab/) As test I've used an SDcard image of 32GB It seems to be able to yield very impressive results mostly due to it's ability to reconstruct from fragmentation. Some rather clever algorithm seems to be going on. Which would also explain why it requires pretty powerful hardware. In the past I've solely used Photorec(Testdisk) and R-studio 8.8, Scalpel Which weren't able to deal with the fragmentation often seen on solid state mediums such as SDcards. Resulting in plenty corrupted, unusable files Scalpel, R-studio and Photorec didn't even yield 1/3rd of the non-corrupted results JPEG Recovery LAB was able to produce from my 32GB test image Has anyone here experiences with JPEG Recovery LAB If so, what are your experiences? To me it looks rather promising It might even make it to our workstation(s) after further testing  amp; validation of results</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I understand the appeal It's not very fast pace but does offer plenty of challenge Besides it motivates the player to think for him self and to use creatively to tackle problems or just let their imagination run wild to create what ever they envision (My dad has a very impressive collection of assets from Steam Workshop in Skylines which he likes to proudly show off) It doesn't have a constricting storyline. Nor any grinding (farming) gameplay elements which for example a lot of RPG's do have. No XP/progress/points/lootboxes elements which can be rather distracting or even stressing. "Need to reach.... this/that before I log off... QUICK QUICK" These games you can just sit back, take your time. think about your next moves. Nobody dictating you what you need to do in order to progress further. I think that's whats appealing to the older players. I can even notice it myself hitting the late 20's mark. Guess I'm in transit of becoming a 'older gamer'... Scary thought</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reminds me of a genius we gave a trail period Day 4. This bloke just walks passed my office. I can clearly see that he has something underneath his arm. Walks straight to the front door. handed someone something, and goes back to his workplace. Just like that, as if nobody saw a thing Even had the guts to wave and smile at me while walking back to his workplace Something felt way off about his whole act I decided to take a little walk across the work-floor Took me just seconds to realize that suddenly we had 5 MacBooks instead of 6 at the table. Needless to say I was pretty certain what happened at that point. But just to be sure let's check the security footage. Here this bright mind was staring a good 5-10 minutes at the camera's before making his move Genius.... Ok let's check the front-sec camera Idiot walks in, his eyes glued to the camera Opens the door and takes a step back, greets his buddy. Now we have his partner in crime clearly visible as well. Even a clear picture of him handing over the stolen macbook to his buddy I mean... I didn't even bother confronting him on the subject It was a rainy day, thankfully the police was so kind to give him a ride</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-19 15:51:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in doubt on how to tackle this problem Figured maybe someone here has faced this issue before The situation is that the client has two drives in a RAID array with Intel Rapid Storage. The setup seems to be a RAID 0 configuration One of the disks is pretty much a goner. 1600+ bad sectors and counting The other one is in bad condition, but readable I am able to successfully recover deleted files using Photorec Yet the file the client really needs is not deleted but present in the current RAID volume. I figured I might be able to explore the partial RAID volume using R-Studio. Sadly I can't explore the partial current RAID volume from within R-studio. Is there any trick/software solution to access/mount the current partial partition? (I have Linux  amp; WIndows workstations at hand) I don't need to resurrect the file-system nor the raid configuration. Just that one file the client desperately needs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I'm asking this in order to restore Light Room backup files for a client. The drives are badly damaged and it seems I have no other way to recover the files than making my own identifier of file mask for deep data craving purposes. If any one on here (multiple would be even better) Would be so kind to open up a LightRoom backup file within a HEX editor for example [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) A great free tool. And be willing to post the first binary results and the last. Something like this for example: (Header of a JPEG file) Start: * FF D8 FF End: * FF D9 To find the start and the end it's best to cross examine multiple back up files and see if they all begin / end with the same value(s) it could be a pair of two, or three It would really help me out greatly! The more samples the better.</TEXT>

In that case you'll need a clean-room for swapping If it's a drive which has been laying in (cold) storage for years. the lubricant might have gone bad. Gently heat the motor for a good 5-10 min. I had success with that in the past, just gently heat it with a airgun on the lowest temperature (best to remove PCB  amp; foam, otherwise the foam between chassis and pcb might melt) If the motor does have a normal reading, try finding the zero ohm resistors / fuses. measure them. if one blew, you could just jump wire it. cross fingers and listen/feel for spin up and access the drive. (saves you finding a exact replacement PCB) But... this isn't by the 'book' sort to speak. I wouldn't do it with any assignments except my own private drives. Which.. well who cares about unorthodox methods *Forgot, if it's needed to jump wire burned fuse(s) make sure you have a stable and clean power supply at hand. Before plugging it in to extract data</TEXT>

One that caught my interest as well is [Venezuela](http://www.deagel.com/country/Venezuela_c0213.aspx) Seems to had conflict and took a beating, but it's recovering rather well. [Israel](http://www.deagel.com/country/Israel_c0100.aspx) loses half it population But [Iran](http://www.deagel.com/country/Iran_c0097.aspx) Seems to walk away with just some bruises Also interesting, China and Russia take a hit in population (minor) but their overall power is rising. The countries whom try to keep a good relationship with RU amp;CHI also don't seem to suffer as much as those whom fully back US A clear example would be Germany compared to Netherlands. The only difference I can think of between them two. Netherlands it's attitude towards Russia and China. They tend to have mutual understanding and respect for each other. Looking at the numbers it seems as if they're hinting at a conflict between US and its most loyal servants vs CHI amp;RU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A rich friend (kinda-friend) He has a habit of having a foul mouth and pissing people off One night he pissed off a rather large group. Me being his (kinda) friend. I stood up for him, we both got our asses served, us 2 vs 12 or so. After we went into a bar, soon after that same group arrived. They were surrounding us like sharks. "Oh great... this is going to be a lovely night" Suddenly my (kinda) friend stood up. went straight for the toilet The f*ck? Is my asshole friend really leaving me here alone with that group... Great! Just great,... Really! That's the last time I'll stand up for my asshole friend 10/15 minutes later a enormous group of asylum seekers turns up. And my (kinda) friend suddenly popped up from the toilet. Walks to the huge group which just entered the bar. Gives every individual around 50$. And pointed to the other group, with his cheeky rich asshole grin. Within seconds all hell broke loose Staring at the battle ground like [Joffrey](http://i.lv3.hbo.com/assets/images/series/game-of-thrones/character/s3/joffrey-1024.jpg) he really did love the chaos that erupted.

Shouldn't it be a GPT partition table? Did you wipe the NVMe with example Gparted and changed the layout to MBR instead of GPT? Not sure if that's the issue but... Might be worth investigating what the current partition table is and if it's correct</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Difficult...the setup is far from ideal. So many things could be conflicting/causing issues And as far as I know, you can't change the partition table without erasing the drive (But I could be wrong) Still I think it's something worth checking even without a EFI enabled board. You can still boot from GPT without having a UEFI based system If the NVMe uses GPT partition table currently, try using MBR.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Excellent! It's at least booting (even tho,.. needs some manual commands)  gt;So now what? What is wrong that grub won't boot on its own, yet boots with those commands from the grub  gt; command prompt? Good question. I have no idea to be honest But,. might be worth taking a look at 'grub.cfg' Should be located at (boot-partition)/boot/grub/ or /boot/grub/ There might be something standing out explaining why this is happening. I guess Grub's auto-conf is confused about your unusual configuration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very simple method. You'll need two USB sticks A USB stick containing ubuntu (live-installer) Another USB stick, which needs to be wiped Plug both USB sticks in, boot from Live-USB Run the installer as you were to install on a internal hard-drive. But instead of choosing to install on a hard drive, select the second (wiped) USB stick as target. Install ubuntu on that After installation, reboot machine. remove the Live-usb. It should boot from the newly created full installation of Ubuntu from the second USB stick. Now just add the programs you need. Just as a regular installation! *But will it boot on other system(s) Yes, it will boot. (Best for compatibility, make it a "legacy" installation instead of EFI)</TEXT>

Yes, boot from the newly installed "full" Ubuntu on USB Doesn't have to be 'each time' tho, just the times you need the USB for file recovery  gt; If so I should use installed version, why not install ununtu on usb and then install two program and then run over the installer version of ubuntu on usb You can, but that will require making a persistent data partition on live-usb (A bit more complex method)  gt; whats the reason for "Plug both USB sticks Because we're going to install a full Ubuntu installation onto the empty USB stick.  gt; previously installed programs will not appear as application on the newly installed ubuntu, not? No, it's a full installation thus installed programs remain even after reboot  gt; Could you double check to e sure its accurate? No need, it's accurate. In short: With those easy steps you've created a USB containing a full Ubuntu installation. Meaning it retains data even after reboot(s).</TEXT>

Back in those days I was aware of her online hobby I didn't mind because they were rather tasteful, artful. Besides it kinda made me proud I don't see myself as this very attractive guy Yet I was in relationship with this 'goddess' All those jealous guys were boosting my ego I guess What spooked us both is how big and fast of a dedicated 'fanbase' she was gathering. And that was the end of it. It was crossing the boundaries between online and real life. "Is he just looking at my gf? or does he know?" After a while our suspicion was bordering paranoia We both didn't like it anymore. It was negatively influencing our daily lives from that point Thus the whole show stopped. They were getting really close of 'unmasking her' with comments such as "Pretty sure she worked here and there a few years back" Which were right. Our biggest mistake was a short video clip. It had [music playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0b5NXZis_U) on the background (I was listening to music in another room) Which gave a way quite a lot. Our native language</TEXT>

It's very likely I would have been incarcerated multiple times. Due to that it's a safe bet to say unemployed and perhaps homeless. Suddenly I wouldn't be a 'model citizen' but a burden to the system. The only difference is the environment. Not me. And all that due to my curiosity about brain chemistry.

    <TITLE>[SELF]Why I developed deep contempt towards Christianity in my early childhood</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-03 12:24:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was raised a christian. From early age my parents always took me to Sunday services In the Netherlands it's quite common to take the bike pretty much anywhere so did we to church At a certain age (Around the age of 8~9) I was allowed to take my own routes to church Which made me feel very grown up! My parents took a bit more practical and straight forward route I took the more scenic route, across parks, bridges, alleyways. Way more exciting and interesting route! Felt like a adventure Till that one day that changed something drastically within me. It changed my perspective on society, religion. That day, a early Sunday morning in autumn. I took my own route to church again like I've been doing for some time. I was biking parallel to a canal. Somehow I lost balance and fell off my bike I landed in the canal. I couldn't touch the bottom of the canal it was rather deep I couldn't lift myself out of the water either, winter jacket soaked up much water it was weighing me down Only thing I could do was cling on to the embankment for dear life It became alarmingly obvious to me that I wasn't getting out of this situation on my own Starting to panic, the cold was getting to me. I felt myself getting weaker and my fingers were becoming more and more numb Holding on to the embankment became harder by the second I was yelling and screaming for help. In the distance I saw people on their bike coming in my direction Fellow Christians! Also underway to the Sunday service. Folks whom could be my neighbor, my teacher. my pastor. The good folks! Or so I've been told. Surely they'll come to my aid. I felt so relieved I'm gonna be okay This middle aged couple looked at me, didn't even flinch. They just casually passed by me Guess they were more concerned about their dignified church wardrobe getting wet. In a span of 5~10 minutes a few more church goes passed by. All acted exactly the same 'Lets just pretend we didn't see/hear him... and continue our travels' I never felt this heart broken and confused. I did not understand their reluctance to intervene. Suddenly there was this loud splash behind me coming from the opposite side of the canal. Here was this guy in his early twenties. The kind I've been told about 'bad people' definitely not a christian. He was wearing a leather jacket with patches on them 'ACAB, NOFX' that I remember. This guy didn't hesitate for a second he grabbed me and pulled us both back on dry land. The same folks I've been told were 'punks, thugs, drunks, addicts' He was the only one whom acted not my fellow christian I've been told to look up to 'respectable people' I bet my fellow good christian whom casually passed by me prayed for me tho! Thank god for that. At least they feel better for not acting when necessary. Just keep up the facade of being 'good' let's hope they slept well that night. As far as I'm concerned not acting in dire situations is the worst kind of evil. I never felt so betrayed in my life. I never felt so helpless I never felt so much anger I never felt so much contempt for a particular group of society That day I swore I'll never be like them. I'll act when needed They can keep their prayers</TEXT>

Just a few clicks Except for Manjaro which is a bit less Linux beginner friendly. Only thing is with Ryzen, One needs to use relatively new kernel. Recommend 5.X.X Any newer dist like ubuntu 19.04, Ryzen fully works out of the box. LTS releases with kernel 4.15 might be a challenge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's likely that other(s) run into the same issue as me with this particular motherboard / graphics-card combination. Problem: Random crashes while gaming / weird stuttering / loss of HDMI signal while gaming / system freezes I was pretty certain it's due to AMD drivers not being fully stable with the new generation of RDNA cards Today I spotted something peculiar in BIOS (F41) PCIE Mode - gt; Gen4 Rather odd since B450 chipset does not have PCIe Gen4 Figured it might have something the do with the stability issues I'm experiencing with my system I've updated the BIOS to version F42c And behold! The PCIE mode is suddenly Gen3 Tested the same games that were giving me trouble before now without any issue! Even after a prolonged period (+2h) In short: If facing the same issues as me with this particular motherboard/GPU combo and nearly ready to just RMA the RX 5700. Update the BIOS to F42c *Reposted, made a flair mistake 'Tech support' in my previous post.</TEXT>

Not planning on doing extreme OC-ing (not a suitable board for it either) I'm using an R5 2600 CPU Haven't tried any OC-ing yet, might do so in the future Overall I'm pretty happy with this board, the only downside so far is the hideous looking Gigabyte UEFI but it does the job!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Canvas fingerprinting and ads(trackers) It's a pain. Luckily one can make it a lot harder for the data collectors. Use a privacy respecting browsers like Firefox for example. Use a network wide DNS blocker. Like Pihole Use something like uBlock Origin for when being outside of your own network And disable as much as you can concerning telemetry services on your phone/computer/laptop what ever. For Windows there are a few handy and easy tools available. Like Spybot Anti-Beacon / DWS (Destroy Windows 10 Spying) Use tools such as CCleaner to clean up browsing behaviour/history/cookies Just those basic tips make a difference But for the best results one should read into the matter and the options available all the tools mentioned can deliver much more than the basic configuration it comes with</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Complete overhaul of system for an client with autism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-11 15:42:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>First time ever I felt compelled to ask the question here. Usually I know my way around but this time I'm in doubt on what's the best way to proceed. In short, I was approached by a caretaker. Whom speaks on the behalf of the client. A person with severe autism. This person likes video games a lot. His current system is an A320, Ryzen 1500, RX 570 It's a decent machine but... The client wants to use VR And his system needs to be up for the challenge, now and for the near future (+ couple of years) Thus I've assembled a upgradeset, consisting of 2060 Super, 16GB DDR4 kit, Ryzen 3600 and a B450 motherboard Tomorrow the caretaker drops off the clients machine for the upgrade. It must be done rather fast because well.. the client really gets upset if he can't do his daily routines. Thus the plan is to have everything ready before noon. Something which can easily be done. Except here's the catch I have to deliver everything as it was. Same windows background, same arrangement of shortcuts, same folder locations everything exactly as it was. I could just drop in the old hard drive (SSD) and pray it will boot which I highly doubt... So most likely it's gonna be a fresh Windows installation. And here I have questions. What would be the easiest way to immigrate all his files to a new Windows installation. And also keeping the user specific data I thought MigWiz might do the job, except it doesn't (Doesn't copy over the background for example) I could just copy over the whole %AppData folder and do everything else manually. Reinstalling games and so on Yet this would be time consuming, would be hard to get everything done before noon Is there any other clever way which would result in a (near) identical environment the client is used to but without much manual labor?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I've never seen this discussed before and I think I've found something new You haven't. You describe poor grounding / sub defect it has nothing to do with the graphicscard. And a driver issue with the graphicscard (DXGI) is unrelated to the first problem. This problem is often caused by faulty installation of the graphicscard. Try reseating the card  amp; PCIE power cable if that doesn't do the trick do a clean driver install. Concerning audio, Ground loop or there is a short in one of your speaker wires which would also explain it. For test purposes use two isolated devices. The SVS active sub (Has it's own build in amp). Try using a smartphone as audio source. If you experience the same issue. There's definitely something wrong with the sub. To eliminate a short try wiggling the audio cables and see if the noise changes. If so, it's the wiring if not it's the subs amp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on her direct environment. I was attacked by a German Shepard around the same age (~8yo) I did become afraid of larger dogs and when I was outside I always felt vulnerable. Expected it to happen again any moment. My mom tried shielding me from it. Which only made it much worse Until my uncle had enough of it. He owns multiple large dogs [Boerboels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerboel) Without my mom knowing at the time he locked me up in his shed with the dogs. I was absolutely terrified. My uncle said something along the line "You can only remain afraid of it so long, after something else will take it's place. Trust me" Hours passed and... nothing happened. Absolutely nothing It took some hours, but I decided to sit down my legs were getting tired and besides... I wasn't mauled (yet) So I did that. I sat down on the ground and that caught one of the dogs attention Again my heart was racing. Dear god... It's coming towards me! No sudden moves... Shit oooh it's going to happen now! And the dog just decided to lay down beside me and placed it's head on my lap. I petted the dog eventually It did work. I wasn't as terrified of dogs anymore Still a bit uneasy but.. not terrified. After he taught me about dogs in general. Their mindset and behavior. The signs you need to watch for. All the basics It took years to get over it completely but my uncle's "cruel" methods did work</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Out of curiosity I've bought it. Wanted to see what they did exactly with MGS1. Turns out they used the same method as I did with my [fan-made patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/4qlv1c/final_full_release_metal_gear_solid_1_integral_pc/) Seems to be nearly identical. Except they use a GoG branded version of DGvoodoo (DX Wrapper) And they didn't use any post processing like I did (Reshade) There is one big difference tho. Not sure how/what they did exactly but their executables (mgsi.exe mgsvr.exe) are different! They seem to support a bit higher native resolution And perhaps fixed the illusive 'disk-1' error (not entirely sure) For folks whom want to use my enhancements with this release: 1) Install GOG version 2) Make a backup of mgsi.exe and mgsvr.exe 3) Use my patch 4) Restore the backed up executable's 4) Set max resolution ingame 5) Enjoy! Or do it the other-way around. Install mine version. copy over GOG executable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Searching Relatives of an Partially Unknown Deceased Person from Nigeria [Cold-Case Team Amsterdam]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I'm acting with permission and on the behalf of the cold case team. I'm not an police officer. On 19th of July 2001 an female was found unconscious. Nearby the Groeneveen apartment-complex in the Bijlmermeer district of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. She's been treated in AMC hospital in Amsterdam for severe head-injuries. Unfortunately she did not make it. The cause of her injuries are unknown. determining her identity has proven to be difficult. She didn't have any ID on her. Her possible identity is believed to be: **Philo Omoruxi** or **Philo Omoruyi** It's believed she's from Benin City Nigeria. Since 2001 there have been multiple attempts to verify her identity. Due to multiple aspects they have not been able to positively ID her. Partially due to corruption and/or unwillingness of the local police departments in Nigeria. 19 years later her grave deserves a name. Her family deserves to know. I'm looking for any help I can get. Maybe someone knows someone with that last name whom happens to have a missing relative. Any help is welcome.</TEXT>
