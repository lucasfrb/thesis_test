    <TEXT>Almost everything. I think im not a good person, i try hard to be nice to everybody, to seem happy and be careless an extrovert. I remember just one time i was true to someone, it was just because i had it everything under control and nothing to lose with being myself. And just as i expected he called me cruel but we both were using each other so it was ok.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We are playing it in roll20 but without buying the module, our GM simply searches the maps, and I think it's going pretty well. He has the books given from another GM in digital. I think there's no need to buy it, but that's related to the amount of work you are willing to do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Start with Hell's rebels?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:36:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I'm a new GM and i last week I ran a one-shot because my friends wanted to try. As a player I'm fairly new also, I've been playing ROTL for a few months and I'm at the begging of 3rd book. That appart, everyone was pretty excited and liked the one-shot. Now they wanna play a larger adventure with the characters from said one-shot (because they leveled up). Question is should I start with Hell's rebels? If not, which do you recommend? I'm trying to avoid anything related to ROTL and Kingmaker. Thank u. Edit: Players are a Druid with a big cat, an unchained monk, an unchained barbarian, a bard and an unchained rogue.</TEXT>
