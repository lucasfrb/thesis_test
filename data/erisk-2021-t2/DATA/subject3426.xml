    <TEXT>Am not going to undervalue your struggles in Sri Lanka, but racism doesn't just exist in America, racism is global, there's racism everywhere and it's getting worse, People have been protesting for days now,other countries are joining as well so it's just not an 'American thing' , the black lives matter movement has never been this strong so it's really commendable that big companies are backing this movement, it really does(and PS when we say black lives we include all minorities as well)</TEXT>
