    <TEXT>Another option and honestly this would be up to the DM when you find one to actually make use of this, but he could of let you escape because he has something he wants you to do. This could lead to neat side missions as well as a reason your not just dragged back to help which I'm sure could easily be done in some way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was thinking and sorry for the late reply, that he let you escape because he knew he could bring you back at any moment but will grant you time on the overworld if you do as he asks. Something along those lines, but some of the funniest parts could be left up to the DM and less known by character down the road. When you do find someone it's worth a talk, I always enjoy when game adds little pieces that relate right to my character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the one thing that gets me is that detect magic does only last 10 minutes, which means they do have to re cast every 10 minutes using verbal and somatic aka he's at least talking and moving weird every 10 minutes. As well it is still concentration so that means as long as they are using that they can not use any other concentration. So basically he can ruin most sneaking attempts by alerting the enemy with his talking. The spell does have limitations of what it can be seen through. This spell can't detect magic through 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. So hide someone behind something (maybe they were alerted by the weird guy talking gibberish and waving his arms) and that could still leave them open to be attacked. The DM has many options at their disposal, if you want to make it really tricky you could have a room with lots of hiding places or just one for that initial attack. Good luck with your game :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also because of the other comment I did look this up and Jeremy Crawford has ruled (via Twitter) that while you detect the presence of a magically invisible creature within 30' you can't see its aura unless you can see the creature. So they can tell something's there they just don't know what or where.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pennies, yes the 1 #162; coin before they were taken away from us here in Canada. People would bring hundreds of pennies and throw them at others. We had one teacher who would pick up every single one in the class, so people super glued them to the floor, or made a trail leading her out of the class (how she kept falling for it and leaving her door locked still shocks me). After they were banned people still brought them by filling their shoes. I still don't know how this started.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A place near me is called boardroom game cafe, so what it is is $5 per person to enter and you can play any boardgame they have , or bring stuff in to play other games like dnd. Tuesday nights are their tabletop night that usually gets pretty booked up. Having stuff for tabletops is an added bonus but they do also serve food, from sandwiches to snacks. Maybe some diversity to a shop would up his business, get a whole bunch of donated boardgames maybe buy a few and start serving some food. This way you focus on a larger audience and while it's still an awesome place to play trpgs it also will have more cashflow to build on.</TEXT>

I was at a local Con and there was a class where you got to paint a mini for an hour and it was a great time, so I picked up a starter kit for paint and followed along but honestly just wanted to paint something all on my own, with my own color scheme. This Beholder was so much fun to paint, took me a good chunk of today to paint it. Welcome to any ideas or advice you have for me! Thank you in advance :)</TEXT>

We found a good spot in the early afternoon as it was already starting to get busy. We waited in this spot for hours until about 2 hours before midnight security came and said they were closing this section down and we'd have to find some wheres else. At this point you would have to be back so far you couldn't see anything anyways so we hoped on a bus and went to our hotel and watched it on the tv.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This, if you have an teammate right up by you then yes you get sneak attack, you don't just get advantage for going first without being assassin (or what would be the point of the subclass abilities). In 5e they have made it a lot easier to get your sneak damage and it's still a great option unless you're the only front liner on the team and everyone else is range haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean officially they do make what would normally be a large creature a medium size for playable races. They typically have a perk that can help with carrying ect, for example on the Goliath playable race: Powerful Build You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. This seems like a good compromise and something to bring up to the dm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's hard to give advice overall for the modules since they are written differently from even eachother, but I will try my best. With a module I read it all beforehand so you the DM knows what's going on, sometimes info can be a little scattered until you have the whole picture yourself. They do not always give you everything and your ment to do some work yourself, for example my current campaign is Storm Kings Thunder. Chapter 3 is a random encounter table, locations and then an encounter that you add in when you feel it's a good time to move on, so that whole chapter for me was homebrew. Then for me at the end of the session I like to have some idea of where they are going and prep accordingly for the next session. Sometimes things go different then you expected and things have to be adapted on the spot. If you had some more concrete examples of where your having trouble it would make it easier to help you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A class or even subclass does not have to dictate your RP. That being said conquest paladins can be very different ends, you can have a paladin sworn to an evil god and want to take over the land, or fight for the other virtues and work to become stronger, crush evil doers with an iron fist. While I love RP and listening to others for inspiration is great to really get into it you have to make it your own. It may take a while of playing and RPing to get it down but if you keep trying you'll get there. Remember it's about having fun.</TEXT>
