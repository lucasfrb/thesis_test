    <TEXT>Holy shit I never thought I #8217;d find someone else who has this fear. First time I had my blood drawn I was 12, and before I even knew what was going on I passed out. I can #8217;t handle blood being taken and when I sleep I can #8217;t wear hoodies because the hoodie presses ever so slightly on my neck and it makes me nauseous. When I become aware of my breathing I have to distract myself because I become queasy. So glad someone else goes through this. My entire family makes fun of me for it and always has. I just don #8217;t know what to do about it because exposure does NOT work for me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Living with venephobia as a trans man.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-09 06:23:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve lived with severe venephobia (fear of veins and arteries.) almost my entire life. It #8217;s absolutely debilitating. I can #8217;t even think about the mechanics of a blood draw without getting dizzy, and have even seized when getting it done. I #8217;ve finally gotten to the point where I can look at the veins on my hands and feet, but the fear still lingers. All I want is to transition, but the very thought of going through it terrifies me. Sometimes I convince myself that the outcome isn #8217;t worth the terror I would feel, which sounds silly. My phobia mixed in with the need to transition has made me question whether or not I should just end my life to save all the trouble. I #8217;ve attempted in the past, and now I #8217;m contemplating it again. And I know if I do it I can #8217;t fail or else I #8217;ll be put on an IV again. I can #8217;t win. On a lighter note, I #8217;m actually incredibly proud of myself. At one point my drive to start a new life overcame my phobia and because of that I #8217;m now six months on testosterone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude. This is the best comment I #8217;ve ever received. I #8217;m the exact same way, come at me with a tattoo gun and I #8217;m fine, cause you #8217;re exactly right it doesn #8217;t go into any plumbing, but come at me with that butterfly needle and I #8217;m done for. I wish you the best of luck on your labs, and I know you #8217;re badass and you #8217;ll be able to get that surgery one day. We #8217;re all in this together brother. And ya know what, I #8217;ll have a cup of coffee too! ~Cheers</TEXT>
