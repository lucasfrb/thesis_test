    <TEXT> gt; We #8217;re probably going to see human-to-human transmission within the United States, #8221; Dr. Robert Redfield said in an interview with STAT. He added that  #8220;at some point in time it is highly probable that we #8217;ll have to transition to mitigation #8221; Likely is a synonym of probably. So while *technically* he didn #8217;t say likely; What Dr. Redfield was trying to convey, quite literally meant likely.</TEXT>

Compare these results to anything else, for example  #8220;firetrucks reddit #8221;, and you will see that there is some pretty clear and blatant censorship going on.</TEXT>

We #8217;ve been so far behind that it #8217;s become irrelevant. ~~This article is 6 hours old and is stating there #8217;s 44,000 confirmed cases.~~ ~~We had this many cases 9 days ago...~~ Edit: /u/Lupius pointed out that the study was based upon 44,000 cases.

The majority of the news that #8217;s being reported, and what the general population is aware of, seems to be roughly 2-4 weeks behind what anyone who #8217;s been actively following this already knew or was aware of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand what you #8217;re saying, and you #8217;re technically right. There #8217;s obviously going to be less information, links, threads, etc. But that #8217;s not how it works when it comes to these searches. What I mean when I say you can search  #8220;anything else #8221;, is that when you search for a specific thing and then add  #8220;reddit #8221; at the end; you #8217;re introduced to hundreds of threads and they #8217;re all specifically linking you to reddit. If you look up something like  #8220;Coronavirus reddit #8221;, you #8217;re given 3-4 links to a few threads on reddit, and then a bunch of random mainstream media sites. None of which have anything to do with reddit. This shouldn #8217;t happen. Like you said, there is obviously going to be less information in general, but we can all see with our own eyes that there #8217;s hundreds and hundreds of posts here daily. No one can deny that. So why isn #8217;t anything coming up when it #8217;s searched for? Because censorship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey mods, Friendly degenerate here. Quick suggestion, what do you guys think about leaving the BNO posts up regardless if there #8217;s a post before hand. Due to the increase in news lately, BNO tends to be a few minutes behind now, which has caused posts with their tweets to get removed due to it technically being a repost. Only reason would be because the BNO posts are easily identifiable and known to be reliable. It #8217;s much easier to see, rather than sifting through inconsistent titles and wild phrasing from a huge variety of sources.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is there any easy way to get in contact with a Mod? We #8217;re told to message them, yet get no response. Ive been posting here daily for the last 2-3 months and am running into massive issues now. Latest Italian case post via BNO was removed due to it being unreliable. How is it unreliable if you have the BNO tracker in this exact post? It #8217;s a pain in the ass having multiple posts getting wrongly removed and not being able to do anything about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but you know what they do have? Money. People won #8217;t get tested if they can #8217;t afford it.  gt; "Pres. Trump: Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing," he said. But actually  gt; This is not the case. Many insurers have said they will pick up the cost of coronavirus testing for some policyholders, but not the treatment. And saying a test or treatment is covered doesn't mean it's free. So, without free testing for all, shit is fucked.

    <TEXT>Ah, ok. I apologize. But could something not be done? Like figure out the cost of the test, and then just issue that much money to every American, so they can go get tested? Obviously there #8217;s holes in that plan, but you see what I #8217;m saying? Sorry if I sound ignorant or dumb, I #8217;m just genuinely confused as to why they can #8217;t spend money on the American citizens. Edit: I #8217;m also not well versed in policy so excuse me if I make absolutely no sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but this overwhelms the hospitals. When you have hospitals that have to pick and choose who lives and dies based on age. You then have people dying that shouldn #8217;t be dying, people dying of other things, just because they can #8217;t get medical help.

    <TEXT>It also states in the rule, if there are multiple witnesses, then it #8217;s fine. The video clearly has multiple witnesses all relaying what they #8217;re seeing. This isn #8217;t a meme, I #8217;m not advertising anything, and to call this blurry is an over exaggeration. I totally understand if it #8217;s the classic shot of an orb that can easily be explained as a star or planet, but this is totally different? If this doesn #8217;t qualify for this sub, I unfortunately don #8217;t know what could? We can #8217;t have pentagon quality videos, with multiple pilots as witnesses, consistently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You saw this in 15th? My girlfriend and I are also in B.C. and saw something identical. Friday night we were sitting on our deck just watching the sky and having a drink - all of a sudden a bright orb (best way to describe it) appeared just below and to the right side of the North Star, and it was heading east extremely fast. It didn #8217;t have any flashing lights on it, but it was all over the place, and kept disappearing and reappearing, before eventually heading behind the mountains. I wish I pulled my phone out, but I was so struck, I didn #8217;t want to miss it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I #8217;d agree with this, Until my girlfriend and I saw something we can #8217;t explain. If someone would want me to make a post, I #8217;m more than happy. I have no photo or video as we didn #8217;t want to miss it. But I #8217;ll post what I have posted elsewhere: My girlfriend and I live in B.C., Canada. and on May 15th at around 9:30ish pm - we were sitting on our apartment deck watching the sun go down and the stars come out. All of a sudden a super bright orb just kinda appeared a little right to the North Star. It was going from west to east fairly slowly but kept disappearing and reappearing and moving all over the place. After about 10 seconds it just disappeared. We ruled out a plane/heli as there was no nav lights, and satellites obviously wouldn #8217;t be able to make these maneuvers. I tried to justify a drone, but I #8217;ve played with my fair share of drones and I just can #8217;t see it. I #8217;m almost tempted to bring a drone out there and see if I can recreate it. While it was unexplainable, the fact that I #8217;ve seen plenty of other people seeing the same thing, it makes it that much weirder. I #8217;ve spoken to 3 other people from my province alone, who have had almost identical sightings, except one of them was during the day. If this is a coincidence, then it #8217;s a pretty crazy one.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>UFO sighting from May 15th, 2020</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 23:09:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I commented on a post yesterday, and said I #8217;d post my sighting here if anyone would like. There was a bit of interest, so I figured I #8217;d give a little write up of what my girlfriend and I encountered a few days ago. If people want to dismiss this, totally understandable. I #8217;m just a dude on reddit, right? This post is going to be a little underwhelming, as I don #8217;t have any footage. But some may find it fairly interesting, as it #8217;s more about the multiple sightings. Copy/paste from a separate post I made: My girlfriend and I live in B.C., Canada and on May 15th at around 9-9:30ish pm - we were sitting on our apartment deck watching the sun go down and the stars come out. All of a sudden, a super bright  #8216;orb #8217; just kinda appeared a little bit to the right to the North Star. I couldn #8217;t gauge exactly how far away it was, maybe a few KM away. It was going from west to east fairly slowly (looked a little faster than a small plane) but kept disappearing and reappearing and moving all all over the place (up and down, and super weird jittering) and after about 20-30 seconds it just disappeared. We ruled out a plane/heli as there was no nav lights, and satellites obviously wouldn #8217;t be able to make these maneuvers. I would try and justify it as a drone, but I #8217;ve been around my fair share of commercial sized drones (Vancouver film) and they can #8217;t move like this thing. Not even close. Laser pointer wasn #8217;t even in the question. So, While it was unexplainable to me and obviously a super exciting thing to have happen. What makes this so insanely interesting is the fact that I #8217;ve seen other people within the last week or so, upload and post about this exact thing that I saw. There has been 3 other sightings within mu province alone. These look similar to some of the Brazil orbs and the orb in the UK with the little girl commentating on the whole thing. I find that extremely exciting, confusing, and eerie. I #8217;m so curious as to why there has been so many of these sightings within the last little bit. I apologize for formatting. On mobile but I tried my best. Edit: Videos of similar sightings. Videos obviously don #8217;t do it justice. It #8217;s hard to convey how ducking weird these are in person. https://twitter.com/aliensonearth_/status/1261273225465671680?s=21 https://reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/gmu9s4/ufo_like_in_magebrazil_filmed_in_squamishcanada/ https://reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/gnknps/anyone_know_what_this_is_in_the_sky_cant_explain/</TEXT>
