    <TEXT>I hope the entire world gets corona virus. NATURAL IMMUNITY and ANTIBODY generation FOR THE WIN! Title. This is what i believe. Even though i know the virus is NOT natural and WAS created in a lab by evil psychopaths and idiot whitecoat lab god-wannabes. As to WHERE it was created, i personally do not fall in line with those who say "it came from Wuhan China". I am far more likely to believe it came from the UNITED STATES (ala Fort Detrick) or even possibly that bio-defense lab in Canada as opined by the ESTEEMED VIROLOGIST Dr. Francis Boyle who did think it came from there (from Canada). I have MORE FAITH in the GOD-created Natural Immune System than i do ANYTHING "created" by MANKIND. And NO, ALL MASK WEARING is for IGNORANT SLAVES.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok really? You think you can just freely say the n word without thinking about how others feel about it? What the hell is wrong with you? It may be an imageboard, but that doesnt mean you should take on the liberty of acting like a total asshole. Why don't you ever consider acting normal towards people of different races? You are very disrespectful and I  #64257;nd this very distasteful. You should get off your computer and stand in a corner for  #64257;ve minutes to think about what you have just done. This goes for the rest of you assholes thinking that you can just throw the n word like that so freely. And honestly, I don't care if you're gonna start calling me the n word too. It will just prove my point that you are all just a bunch of sel #64257;sh, racist,  #64258;aming pigs. Seriously, people these days need to act more mature for once instead of believing that they can say or do anything they want, whether or not it pisses other people off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I fucking care for you. Drink water, stop eating and drinking sugary craps, eat smaller portions and don't eat snacks and work out (not required but it's still good for your body) to lose weight. I was like you, skipping meals to get skinner but I realized anorexia is deadly and teenagers need to eat more than adults like 2000-3500 calories (depending on activity level and gender), don't believe me? Google it. Please dont turn it to anorexia.</TEXT>

I forgot to include one devil jin combo in this video, it's: Sidestep left, uf2, dash a bit, 1+4, 1 (input two 1 if you want to walk carry further), b2,3 S! then end the combo with f,n,d,df+1 UF (b2,1 doesn't work) or b2,3 for wall combo. Please keep in mind it's difficult to do these combos in a real match even if your reaction is good and fast. Also jumping backwards and pressing 4 probably works on all characters.</TEXT>

It may be an imageboard, but that doesnt mean you should take on the liberty of acting like a total asshole. Why don't you ever consider acting normal towards people of different races? You are very disrespectful and I  #64257;nd this very distasteful. You should get off your computer and stand in a corner for  #64257;ve minutes to think about what you have just done. This goes for the rest of you assholes thinking that you can just throw the n word like that so freely. And honestly, I don't care if you're gonna start calling me the n word too. It will just prove my point that you are all just a bunch of sel #64257;sh, racist,  #64258;aming pigs. Seriously, people these days need to act more mature for once instead of believing that they can say or do anything they want, whether or not it pisses other people off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try updating all apps in galaxy store and Google play. Don't forget to update Google play itself, you can do this by going to google play settings, scrolling down and tapping on Play store version once. Also social media apps like snapchat and facebook  amp; messenger can drain your battery fast, check their settings inside the app and see if you can do anything to stop these apps from draining the battery. You can also turn off background activities for apps but you might not get any notifications.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought I was only the one, we bought witcher 3 over 5 years ago and my bro completed the story numerous of times but I'd only get to velen or novigrad then stop playing. But 1 year ago, just when I finally progressed and traveled to skellige for the first time, my uncle plugged off the power socket plug without turning off the console and ps4 got fucked up and would only start in safe mode, so I rebuilt the database and surprisingly, all of our saved data was gone. After that I said fuck it white orchard, velen and novigrad missions are long and boring asf not to mention I know what happens at the end of the game story and I just stopped playing witcher 3.</TEXT>

I just felt sick.. I wish I had bookmarked this hadith, there is so much violence in this religion</TEXT>

It's nearly impossible create an art like yours on a50s without a stylus. Or maybe, you're just talented. Sorry if I dont make any sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks ( sorry for bad english, as you can clearly see, English is far from being my mother tongue, I was born in Somalia and sold as a child slave to a Hungarian noble and the only language I knew other than Somali then was his whip and incessant beatings, but I picked up a few Dutch slurs and commands while suffering through the ordeal. After one of his three children poisoned his food for inheritance, I #160;was framed #160;for murdering him, but instead of ending my miserable life, they chose to feed me rat poison and sell me to an American human trafficker. As one might expect, he #160;treated #160;me the same way aswell, but as I felt my organs burning inside me for weeks, getting dizzy and #160;light-headed, thirsty, sweating profusely, my heart pounding, extreme panic-ridden anxiety, I then felt like I was freezing, ringing in my ears, disorientation, #160;puking #160;up blood, shivering uncontrollably, which later turned into seizing and lobster clawing, the old bastard couldn't let his newly purchased merchandise go to waste, at least no so soon, so he took me to a dark back alley where some old homeless man did god knows what to my body using his filthy surgical tools that I assumed he got from a dollar store, this all happened while #160;i #160;was completely awake and aware of my surroundings, seeing him completely cut my guts open #160;this only #160;made things worse and the pain was more agonizing than ever before so the wicked devil had no choice but to leave me a few feet away from a hospital,hoping to avoid any investigation on suspicion of human trafficking from the #160;cops, after repeatedly shouting ' Thanks for nothing, you fucking rake.' , words that were #160;imbedded #160;in my mind as they were the only English words I knew.So there I was, clawing my way towards the hospital door as if they were the gates of heaven itself, a few moments before my body completely #160;shut down #160;and #160; left me to a #160;long long #160;nap that I assumed was my #160;final #160;escape from this life long torment. But I was mistaken yet again, as I opened my eyes I saw myself lying in a cozy bed instead of the freezing street that I had assumed was my #160;death bed. A nurse walked up to me and asked me about my name and it didn't take long before she figured out I wasn't a documented citizen of a country I'd only spent a couple of excruciating weeks, and before I knew it, the ICE had kicked me out back to Somalia. I found my village which I was happy to see finally got the developments our country promised such as a toilet that we take turns using in the village. I managed to write this by banging two wires together which #160;provide #160;electricity #160;for the entire country after years of trying to figure out how to write letters using nothing but electricity, thus I became the first Somali in the World to invent what I call the ' Somali telegraph ', with this I can write messages to people across the globe, and I chose my first one to thank you, kind stranger, for your behavior #160;in accordance with #160;myself, but #160;in order to #160;avoid any public humiliation that might be caused by a fatal error in the English language that could cost my entire reputation as a Somali Genius and inventor, I figured it would be better as a precautionary measure to apologise beforehand for any mistake that I might have #160;committed #160;while writing in a language that is alien to me, and especially to steer clear of offending a person of your caliber. That's why I felt the need to say #160;sory.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok really? You think you can just get the link of the original post without thinking about how others feel about it? What the hell is wrong with you? It may be an imageboard, but that doesnt mean you should take on the liberty of acting like a total asshole. Why don't you ever consider acting normal towards redditors? You are very disrespectful and I  #64257;nd this very distasteful. You should get off your computer and stand in a corner for  #64257;ve minutes to think about what you have just done. This goes for the rest of you assholes thinking that you can just get the original post link like that so freely. And honestly, I don't care if you're gonna start asking me for the link too. It will just prove my point that you are all just a bunch of sel #64257;sh,  #64258;aming pigs. Seriously, people these days need to act more mature for once instead of believing that they can get the original post link by asking, whether or not it pisses other people off.</TEXT>

Can't fool me. Edit: this verse doesn't apply to muslims.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;however if theres a story in the bible that contradicts the Quran, then we classify it as false. Seriously why would Jews and Christians change their scriptures in the first place? There is no source that Jews and Christians changing their scriptures at some point in history.  gt;Even though the pagan arabs had no knowledge of the bible AND our Prophet was illiterate? I'm sure you already know this, Arab jews and Christians were living in Arabia during 6-7th century and pagans probably knew the bible and the Torah. There is a hadith that the prophet says something like O Umar, why are you reading the Torah? Was my message not clear? Wallahi if musa was alive he would have no choice but to follow me.

(Yusuf Ali) With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space. -Surah Adh-Dhariyat, Ayah 47 Yusuf Ali translation doesn't say "expanding"?  gt;the Big Bang theory, Quran says the heavens and earth were conjoined and We splitted them apart. ..earth didn't even exist when the big bang happened.  gt;iron coming from space, I heard before the quran some books in ancient locations like Egypt and Syria said that irons came from the sky.  gt;embryology Fetus in pregnant women? It is incorrect and in some hadith, an angel comes to the womb and says O Allah will he be wretched or among the guided then Allah will answer. So according to this we just have no free will.  gt;the orbit of the sun earth, moon, That quran verse sounds like it is describing the earth as flat not to mention that in surah the cave, dhul qarnarn saw the sun setting in a muddy spring and in some hadith the prophet explained that and it sounds like he's describing the flat earth.  gt;the 46 chromosome in human body, I think I heard this a long time ago but forgot it.  gt;and how u receive 23 from 1 and another 23 front the other, I don't understand this?  gt;seas not joining together. I heard that this one was debunked and is talking about the rivers or the story of musa and khidr and, the seas eventually do mix.  gt;And why is that the foundation that Islam has is on solid rock where as Christianity #8217;s foundation being flowing sand, because of believing that 1 =3 and since Jesus was god, why didn #8217;t he just forgive everybody instead of sacrificing himself? Since I'm Muslim and ain't no Christian, I can't answer this lol</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it true that Book of Denkard 9 was authored in 1020 and Zoroastrianism copied the idea of hell bridge from Islam?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 15:24:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://youtu.be/KSFQ5IIm-6Q Around 0:34-1:16 timestamp, Apostate Prophet says the hellfire bridge is also mentioned in zoroastrianism but Farid says he couldn't find it and neither could I. Where does zoroastrianism say that people will cross the hellfire bridge like Islam? Around 1:28-2:06 timestamp, Farid says book of denkard 9 was authored in 1020CE in Baghdad, [which is true, though there are no citations/references. (Date and authorship section)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkard) [Another link, wikisource article.](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop #230;dia/Dinkard) At the time of writing this before posting it, I found [this wiki article (Gathas)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gathas) through [As Sirat article.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Sir #257;t) The wiki article itself doesn't say anything about the hellfire bridge but after searching on duckduckgo, it seems like these two websites [Website 1](http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/Perspective%20on%20Yasna%2046.11%20of%20Zarathushtras%20Gathas.htm) [Website 2 (PDF)](https://gathasofzarathushtra.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3.15-Chinvat-The-Bridge-of-Discerning.pdf) talks about the hell fire bridge in zoroastrianism but I'm not sure about it because it's a long wall of texts. Is this where zoroastrianism mentions the hell fire bridge? Btw, I'm muslim and not looking for a debate, just answers. Thanks. Edit: made it easier to click on links.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I checked out that article before posting this but I forgot to check the citations. In citation 5, http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/death/index.htm#chinvat its talking about the hell bridge in zoroastrianism and it looks like it was in book of denkard that was authored in 1020CE. Is it in Gathas or book of denkard?</TEXT>
