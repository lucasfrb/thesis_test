    <TEXT>Not really educated on hair loss but one of my friends who #8217;s 19 started getting a bald spot on the back of his head, he started taking Keeps Hair loss treatment for men, and it worked wonders for him, stopped his hair loss and some actually grew back. Maybe try looking into that. I wish you luck man and I #8217;d definitely suggest doing research on different treatments and such before trying them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is complete bullshit. I have many friends who went into that career wanting to help people, and make this country a better place. Hell I almost joined myself because I wanted to help people but decided not to because of how much hate they get nowadays. There are definitely bad cops, but to say not a single officer has joined wanted to help others is just a complete lie. That #8217;s why I opted to become a firefighter, I want to help people, but I don #8217;t want the backlash of being a cop.</TEXT>

Not sure about your initial question though as I #8217;ve never showed them at my work. But if you want to cover them without dealing with the heat maybe look into an athletic arm sleeve. Can get some for cheap off amazon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I started cutting I didn #8217;t care what others thought at that time, but after I stopped and started facing wearing my arms out in public I regretted it. I guess at the time you don #8217;t really care in the moment, it #8217;s months/years down the line you regret it, because it #8217;s so obviously sh, and you do care what others think after all. That #8217;s why when I relapsed I cut in various places in ways it didn #8217;t look like sh. But others go right back to that *in the moment* feeling and don #8217;t give a shit. At least that #8217;s what I think Or others arms or wherever they sh is just so fucked up it don #8217;t really matter at that point</TEXT>
