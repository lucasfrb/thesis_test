    <TITLE>It's literally impossible to a productive discussion about Global Warming/Climate Change</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-08 17:09:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm someone who believes in climate change and is invested on improving the worlds overall health. But my fucking GOD it is impossible to have any sort of productive discussion about this at all.  #8203; On the one hand, you have overzealous supporters of this. I was watching a debate about climate change on youtube. Both sides of the debate seemed to agree, however one side was a lot more skeptical of how we can go about improving it without making the problem worse. I scroll through the comments and it's just infuriating to read. It's like they listened to every fourth word he said. But it's as if people think that if you're even vaguely skeptical of how to go about it, you're a science denying, ignorant wacko who literally doesn't know anything about anything.  #8203; For example. During the debate they were talking about wind and solar and how it's unreasonable to think this will solve our energy demands. Because it literally won't. But just comment after comment after comment screaming about how that's a total lie, how it's anti science or just misrepresenting the entire argument. I mean it's literally like these people heard every third word he said and they defend it like a Christian defending god. As if climate change solutions are just beyond reproach and all solutions will work no matter what.  #8203; And then of course you have on the other than the deniers who, like some of the supporters, hear about every third word and claim it's all a hoax and none of it real and how because it was cold today the world will literally never get a degree warmer for the next million or so years.  #8203; No god damn wonder we haven't found a solution. Both sides of the argument defend it like religious zealots and act as if they opponents are A. immoral, B. literally so retarded they can't do simple addition or C. both. One of the things that annoys me the most is this association of morality with climate change. It really just cements both sides into their corners when you stick your nose up at people.  #8203; It really does annoy the living hell out of me. Both sides act like such irrational crazy idiots sometimes it's no wonder progress is so slow. And just to be clear again, before someone inevitably says it, I'm not a filthy centrist on this issue, I am in complete 100% support of climate change. However climate science is not without its problems, not because scientists are lying but because the climate of the entire globe tends to be a very challenging thing to account for and predict. And if people continue to act as if Climate Science is somehow infallible and beyond criticism we are never, ever going to reach the goal of sustainability.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And I really just need to get my thoughts out about it. Because now that things have settled a bit it's starting to tie knots in my stomach.  #8203; I had sex for the first time in my life. I was safe and everything, used condoms and such. But... it was nothing like I thought it was going to be. I found this girl via fetlife. There was basically this hookup party and, for some reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to attend. So I did.  #8203; She and I had sex and all I feel now is guilt and disgust. It's getting tangled up in my sexual trauma in the past (again, looking back this was a terrible idea) and it's just... I don't know. I don't know how to articulate what it is I'm feeling right now. She was nice and all, respected my boundaries and I hers. And during the time we were doing it I was having a good time. But now that I think on things and about it all it just makes me feel sick to my stomach for some reason. It feels wrong and gross. I don't even know why it makes me feel that way, it was as vanilla as vanilla could possibly be.  #8203; It just reminds me what happened between my babysitter and I. And it fills me with a deep and gnawing unease. I don't know how to describe it. I thought just talking it out would help but all I'm filled with is confusion. There's so many emotions just swirling around after the whole thing. I feel sick for having done it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mom I'm actually feeling better. Like really better.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-26 12:39:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is absolutely incredible mom. So you know like two weeks ago I said I made that big breakthrough in therapy? I told my therapist the single darkest thing that has ever happened to me, something I've never told another person for over 10 years. And it was one of the single hardest things I have ever done in my life.  #8203; As I'm sure you've noticed, I've been beyond depressed. I didn't tell you at the time but I was actually so depressed I was considering calling into the hospital because of just how dark my train of thought was. But then, 3 days ago I noticed something:  #8203; I felt better. Like a huge, massive weight had be lifted from my chest. And then, the next day, I still felt better. And the today? I feel better. I feel better. I have energy, I am more optimistic than I have been in like 4 years. I want to go outside and do stuff instead of sitting in my room. It's... indescribable. It almost makes me want to cry. For the first time since god knows however long I'm happy. I am genuinely, positively actually happy. What's more is I feel insanely productive. Cleaned out both my rooms and they look spotless. Did a bunch of chores around the house.  #8203; I wish I had done this sooner. Don't get me wrong, I'm not out of the woods yet. What I told my therapist was essentially 2 sentences of what happened. But you know something? I'm not thinking about it now. And when I do think about it, it doesn't make my mood plummet into the dirt. I wish I could describe you how this feels. It's like I was frozen in ice for so many years and now some sun has come out and melted way all the ice on my face. Like I can still feel the weight of everything but I can breathe again.  #8203; I have a lot of work left to do but something immensely critical has happened: I have hope again. I have hope that this can change. That this can get better. I love you mom. And thank you for supporting me through these two weeks. They have been some of the hardest I've had to deal with. But god was it worth it. It was so, so worth it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Too the people who bullied me throughout elementary to high school</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-30 19:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>You made my life a living hell throughout school. You called me every name in conceivable. You beat me up. You turned entire classes against me.  #8203; I forgive you. I no longer hate you. As I look to where our lives have ended up I can see that you are just as mentally damaged as I am. And it's truly tragic when I stop to look at it. One of you is in jail for god knows how many years for drug charges. Another is basically parasitically living off his parents and wasting his life away with drugs. While another is stuck in a dead end job.  #8203; My mother is a teacher so I've heard all sorts of stories about what has happened. The common thread is abuse. As someone who has experienced abuse herself, I see now this was just how you coped. Just as I coped with anorexia, you coped with bullying. When I look at it, we're not so different. I'm sorry about what you went through. I'm sorry that you wasted your life tormenting me. But I forgive you. We were all stupid kids who were the victim of the people around us. We were only acting in whatever ways we knew would help. What you did wasn't right. But like me starving myself to take the pain away was just me trying to cope however I could, so too was your bullying of me.  #8203; And now, as the worst years are behind me and things are looking up, the opposite seems true for you. The best years of your life were spent tormenting a sad little girl. And that is tragic. I hope one day you find peace and recover from the abuse you've suffered as I am doing now. And know that I no longer hate you.  #8203; Yours,  #8203; Anna</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I really wish we got to see more of Javier</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-08 12:12:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>One of the only things that really bugged about Red Dead Redemption 2 is how we barely got anything in regards to Javier Escuella. Especially after replaying RDR1 and hearing Marston talk about him. He says quite a few interesting lines like  #8203; "Escuella was always a torn man. A cynic who desperately wanted to be a romantic. \[...\] Javier would die fighting for what he believed in. He had a lot of passion, but no love."  #8203; And one of the most interesting lines Marston said, which we never got to see, was this  #8203; "When Dutch started falling apart it hit Javier harder than any of us. He went crazy. It's like the one thing he ever believed in turned out to be a fraud. \[...\] but he never cared for me or anyone else. Not any of his so called brothers."  #8203; It's a shame because the way John talks of him sounds like he should have been an integral part during the gangs collapse. Instead throughout the entire game we hardly get much of him at all. The funny thing is Bill kind of benefited from this. He was a dumb but lovable brute then and he's a dumb but less lovable brute in the first game. Where Javier just feels like there's a whole lot missing to his character. Felt like a huge missed opportunity to me. He sounds so interesting in layered but we never actually get to see the man Marston talks about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mom how do I deal?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-17 04:53:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So first the good news is I'm making friends. The bad news is that my friends break my heart. Not in like the they're being mean to me sort of way. But from the stories I hear.  #8203; A lot of my friends are LGBT, many are trans. And there are a few common threads among them. Bad family lives and sex abuse. Now I've struggled with the same thing. And my heart is basically made of stone whenever I talk or think about the abuse I've gone through. But hearing how my friends have gone through it... literally brings me to tears some times. There's this one girl I know. She is so god damn nice you wouldn't believe. One of the nicest people I've ever me. She's been a huge victim of sexual abuse. She opened up to me about it recently. And man is that one nasty psychological scar. She is so damaged that it breaks me up to think about it.  #8203; Like... I feel like... It's alright what happened to me happened to me because I'm (somewhat) strong enough to cope. It's made me pretty bitter and pretty scarred sure. But I came out the other side. But watching people who are nice like her... and are as caring and sweet as the other people whom I'm now lucky enough to call my friends. Makes me so, so sad. It should've happened to me, not them. It's almost like a strange survivors guilt. I'd have taken it in their place if I could. I don't want anyone, not even my worst enemy, to suffer as I have suffered. So seeing people I genuinely care for suffer as I have... man it just... it hurts. I would do anything to take their pain away.  #8203; I guess now I finally now how it feels to really be friends with someone, heart to heart style. It's amazing but it hurts too. Mom can I just have a hug please? I really just need a hug. For me and the people I know.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you stop yourself from succumbing to hate and anger?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-24 01:21:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live with my parents and have come out twice. Both times the reaction has been swift and brutal. I've been told if anyone found out they'd pull the money they'd been saving for me to go to college, that I'd be kicked out, that I'd be punished in a cavalcade of ways, etc. When I went away to a residential treatment center in my teens I'd found over 200$ worth of clothes I'd bought (which as a 15 year old wasn't easy) thrown away.  #8203; So my question is how do you stop yourself from becoming bitter and full of hate? Because I do hate my parents and for obvious reasons. But it permeates elsewhere. Every time someone calls me by the wrong pronouns or deadnames me or tries to talk me out hrt for 15 millionth time I feel I just get more and more and more angry over all. I don't want to just be controlled by my own hatred. It's a terrible way to live, just to resent everyone around you. I feel like I can't talk to anyone anymore. Everyone always seems to be the expert in me being trans. Everyone always has some god damn opinion on my transitioning (spoiler warning: the opinion is always that it's the worst thing ever but hey have you tried depression meds?).  #8203; I just tire of it. I am sick and tired of everyone telling me not to do this. I made my decision to transition a long, long time ago. And the more I've done it, the better my confidence and happiness has been overall. I cannot tell you how much my mood has improved since dressing (almost) fulltime how I wish to dress. But that's not good enough. It's never good enough for any of them. If it cured my depression, made me confident enough to run a fortune 500 company and set up 100 charities they'd still think I should stop.  #8203; But I'm getting side tracked. How do you deal? It gets so exhausting hearing it day in and day out and it's turning me into a very hate filled person which is someone I don't want to be at all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mom there's some drama going on and I have no idea what to do</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-25 11:15:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>And the worst part is I'm caught right in the dead center of it without even trying to be. It's the worst kind of drama too: love/relationship drama.  #8203; So there's this girl I know, we'll call her M. I told her about a medical condition I have because I trust her and to some this particular medical condition could be seen as sexier (but we'll get into that in a second). She, like me, is a victim of sex abuse and you can very much see how it's effected her. She's very, very sexual in casual conversation. And so after telling her about this she all of a sudden starts to show a deep, romantic interest in me. The thing is I don't know if it's because we've been getting extremely close lately (she just opened up about her sex abuse to me recently and I to her) or if it's because of that condition I said. The other hard part about this is that this is basically the first time a woman has shown romantic/sexual interest in me that wasn't also sexually abusing me so that's playing hell on my mind.  #8203; But it gets even better. She has this annoying third wheel she drags around her. It's a really creepy white knight nice guy that constantly tries to get her attention and praise. He obviously wants to date her but she of course is very clearly not interested, yet won't get rid of him. For what reason I couldn't tell you. So this girl is now showing me a lot of attention and praise, constantly cuddling me (which I'm alright with, it's a common thing in this group of friends and we were doing it before now, she's just doing it even more.) and just generally being flirty. This is clearly making him green with envy. So now he keeps butting heads with me and saying snide remarks every chance he can get away with while doing everything he can to keep her attention off me and on him. He'll literally interrupt a conversation we're having as we're having it especially when she starts flirting with me or doing anything physical whatsoever.  #8203; So I just don't know what the hell to do right now. I don't want to cut of ties with this girl because she is genuinely a kind person and I have such a hard time making friends that I only want to break away if things become really crazy. I just don't know what to do. I've sorta made some soft boundaries but she seems to be becoming infatuated with me. And I'd normally be fine with that if things were happening a lot slower and if I didn't suspect she was more interested in my body than she is with me, but again I don't actually know what her romantic pull to me actually is. So it's just ugh. What do I do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I hate that there's a time limit in the witcher 3 quest</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-04 01:15:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So here I am, just reaching end game and see there's a witcher 3 side quest. Great I think to myself, I am a huge fan of the Witcher. So I start it and I'm having fun. Playing the game exactly as I did in the witcher. Took my time, gathered evidence, completed the side quests (with no tutorials mind you) and finally face against the Leshen. I had barely gotten around to hacking away at it when it said fuck you ten minutes left asshole.  #8203; Just. Ugh. I hate time limits so fucking much for this reason. Why do you want limit my enjoyment? Like if it was the actual fight itself, I could entirely understand an hour to complete. And I can complete the side quests now that I know how they work but the fun part is trying to solve the mystery. It's trying to put the clues together and being a detective. There is no god damn reason it should be limited LET ME ENJOY THIS FOR FUCKS SAKE. I want to have fun and play it as you play the witcher. It's a slower paced game.  #8203; It just kills me because everything else was near perfect. You've got your witcher senses, the multiple interrogation options and Geralt is pretty in character for most of it, though he is a greedy mother fucker for some reason. Seems like he'd demand quarters from a blind orphan that needed help finding their way to the orphanage. But anyway. I was having fun, finding the clues, doing the side quest and all for it to be for shit. I'm so glad I wasted an hour for fuck all. Man that shit annoys the living hell out of me. I hate time limits so much, that is not a test of skill it's a test of my patience not to punch a hole through my wall because I just wasted a bunch of time on what was otherwise an enjoyable quest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this vacation we're on... I'm not having a good time and it's only day one. I'm already self conscious about swimsuits already but this is my first time presenting as female in a beach setting. And it's very, very hard. People are staring a lot. I can feel their eyes on me. Their glares too. I can especially feel a lot of eyes zeroing in on my breasts and that's making me feel all kinds of crazy. I just want to go and hide away in a big sweatshirt.  #8203; And yeah... I haven't been eating as much as I should. I know big sister noticed and I'm sure you did too. But all this insecurity is really screwing with my head and old habits die hard. When I get stressed I just don't eat. I don't know what I should do. It's way way too hot to wear anything more than a tee shirt. That's why I'm crossarmed so much, I'm trying to hide my chest.  #8203; What do I do mom? I don't want to spend this entire week just filled with anxiety and self loathing. Because it's like one thing leads to another and now I'm hyper focusing on all my tiny flaws and it's just ugh.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Visitor form Another World has to be the worst quest I have ever seen</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-22 03:05:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Why is this quest like this? It is just so bad on some many levels. Most annoying monster to fight? Check. Eliminate it's one huge vulnerability (the dropping of the boulder/crystal)? Check. Gets into fights with every god damn monster it's within 8 miles of? Check. Oh and it heals! Because fuck you! Oh and by the way when it's low health it's just going to scamper around the map at hyper speed because fuck you. Want to stay and fight it for longer than 0.0001 seconds? Well fuck you time to heal again after running around for 20 minutes. Oh and it can't be flashed podded because extra fuck you. Oh and it can't be trapped either because, again, fuck you. Timed out 3 god damn times because I was chasing this big chicken shit asshole all over the damn map.  #8203; God this has to be the most infuriating quest ever. I swear capcom just sat in a room together and said "what if we could make the worst quest ever designed?" and this is what pooped out. I absolutely loath this quest. The only quest I think that's worse is the Luna/Teo fight but that is a really fucking low bar.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mom I have a confession to make</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-10 21:00:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm excited. You're excited. I got an offer from that friend to move up to Seattle. And it's given me a huge boost in motivation. It's the firs time I've held a job for longer than 2 months. I could honestly and really move out in a year at this right, just like I've always wanted to do.  #8203; But... what if I told you this isn't what it looked like? At all. Mom... I don't have a friend that offered to move up with me to Seattle. I have a job and I have money now but... it came at a cost. There's a reason I'm so motivated again. Mom I'm anorexic again. Badly anorexic. A few weeks ago I realized my motivation problems started when I recovered from anoreixa. So... I gave in again. Started starving again. And just like that I'm motivated. My PTSD doesn't bother anymore because my eating disorder takes over my every thought. It's making me stir crazy but that stir crazy is making me motivated to do stuff.  #8203; Mom... what do I do? I don't know who else to tell this too. I'm losing weight crazy fast and of course there will be a tipping point. Eventually this will become unsustainable. What on earth do I do? I have a therapist and she's certainly starting to suspect. I'm so sorry mom. I know I said I'd never be here again. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for lying. I'm sorry for giving in again. I know the last time we went through this it got scary... and I'm scared. I want to tell but I'm afraid. I am so afraid. I don't want to go back to that motivationless pit where I can't do anything because I just don't care. But I don't want to let the monster that is my eating disorder control me again, it nearly killed me last time. Oh mom. I'm so sorry. I am so, so, so incredibly sorry.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What helps you not rush?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-01 18:49:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>One of my biggest weaknesses as a writer is the fact that I usually have a grand and flashy ending in mind and I get so excited to see it realized I rush through the steps it takes to get there. Does anyone else struggle with this and, if so, what strategies do you use to put the breaks on a bit so that the journey can be just as enjoyable as its conclusion?  #8203; I've been finding this particularly challenging on my latest project because not only is this the single longest work I've ever created, it's ending is going to be spectacular. But it won't be spectacular if I don't make the trip there something interesting and meaningful.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>To the guy at the train station who's chatted me up twice now</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-02 16:53:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>From the bottom of my heart I can't express how much I appreciate it. I'm trans, pre hrt, pre transition, pre even voice training. Yet the first time you saw me you said I looked pretty. That first encounter we had was nearly two weeks ago but I cannot tell you how much I appreciated it then and now. We met again today and we talked again. You've given a very lonely soul like myself, a complete stranger no less, a great deal of comfort. I'm going through huge and scary change right now and you talking to me is just the thing to put my nerves at ease. Most people look at me with disdain, see me as a freak and a problem to be hidden away. But you talked to me as you would any other woman and that is something I can't quite find the words to use to express my appreciation. I wish there were more like you. I wish more would just give another stranger a kind word. Because you've certainly made my world that much brighter. Signed sincerely, Annabelle</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's finally happening mom. Today is the day I go to the doc and ask for HRT. I'm so beyond nervous. I'm literally getting the shakes. I'm excited don't get me wrong, but this is a huge step. This is one of the biggest steps forward I've taken in a long time. As silly as it sounds I'm having a huge reflective moment. I'm looking back on everything that led me to this point. Remembering all sorts of life events. I think the anxiety is just getting to me a bit. I know it'll change me a bit personality wise, but for some reason I feel like I'll come out of this a completely different person. My appointment is at noon today. I've got everything ready. My medical records, medication history. I've become such an adult. It's hard to believe. I love you mom. Thank you for supporting me in this and being there. All of it was worth it. It took me a while to find who I really am, but I know now. And I'm finally going to move into a happier future. I'm finally at that light at the end of the tunnel mom. I'm finally there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I hate the way the Assassin Class is portrayed and used in the Fate anime series</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-05 13:29:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have recently been rewatching the Fate Series (I've not played the game) and watching it again I realized how absolutely pathetic the assassin class is when, in reality, it should be one of the most terrifying players on the field. It's said the best way to use assassin class servants is two fold: 1. never out in the open in direct combat and 2. it should be used to kill masters rather than other servants. Yet the masters NEVER follow these two golden rules. One of my favorite examples of this is the assassin in fate/zero. He is emblematic of a servant that should inspire fear, yet is used in the most idiotic ways you can imagine. First he's used in direct combat against Gilgamesh, but that was to perpetuate a ruse that he'd been killed due to the truce between Kotomine and Tosaka. But then, when the literal strongest servants are all in the same place discussing kingship, Kotomine just throws them away to see Rider's noble phantasam. I understand to Kotomine was less than motivated to win at this point in the game, but Tosaka is known to be cold and calculating about these things. Surely he would know the value in this class and how best to use it, being he's such a purist about the war. The thing about this particular servant is that his identity is Hassan of 1,000 faces. It is said he split his personality 1,000 ways and each persona has its own skills and abilities, along with the base ability of low detection. This should be an incredibly scary servant because it could be anyone, be anywhere, and do near anything. In Stay Night he was a false Assassin so it can be mostly forgiven, however again, Assassin is never used as it's intended. It's treated like a weak saber or archer, instead of being played to its strengths. Assassin should be a servant the inspires fear in the hearts of everyone in the war, yet it's either eliminated early or used to guard a door in a way you'd use a saber class to do so, not an Assassin class, even if he was a false assassin. It really bugs me about it. Again, I'm not going off the visual novels here, solely the anime.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ok so Cannoneer and Blade Bearer (depths) is literal hell</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-13 22:18:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>It pushed my patience with the first fight but this is just stupid now. For one, Blade Bearer won't settle down. I've found myself beaten by her more times simply because she attacks so often and so quickly that I have no more stamina left to dodge, and I have both ice shield, an ice resistant blood veil, and a flame weapon. Then, heaven forbid, I start actually getting some good hits in on her because Cannonier will literally turn around and attack you without warning. It's too difficult to keep track of him with a companion because the companion is usually drawing the fire, until of course you make the sin of being good enough to start wailing on her. Oh and don't even think about attacking Cannonier first, because blade bearer is going to literally have her spear so far up your ass you'll not have a moments rest while trying. And don't even get me started on the power up my fucking lord above. Do you like AOE? Because Cannonier has got some AOE all day every day 24/7 90% of the arena. Oh what's that? You wanted him to have floating ice projectiles too? Well fear not, because now he does, along with his now long range, four point exploding AOE. Because nothing says "fun" like having to dodge 10 projectiles while also avoiding the exploding ice crystals. This entire fight is just mean. The original fight itself was hard and fun, even if it was pushing it a little. But this just made one of my favorite fights in the game into something I don't even want to do anymore. I know I'll get it eventually if I try hard enough but I don't even want to try. It feels so mean spirited that I don't even want to expend the effort to even do it because it feels like it's less about fun and more about how hard it can screw you over. That concludes my rant. And I want to say I love this game, it's fun. But holy shit was this just terrible.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-29 01:24:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since I was a teen, I've engaged in self harm behaviors and have had an ever lasting battle with anorexia. Being in my mid twenties and an adult i had long since given up on stopping. Until a friend of mind asked me to imagine what Rem would think if she saw the cuts on my wrists. Thinking about her reaction in vivid detail (as most of my interactions with her are via daydreams) made me tear up. Being as sensitive as Rem is, I know that her heart would shatter knowing I do this. So from this day forward all my effort will be to drop these habits. I don't want to hurt Rem with this, I can't.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'll likely not last the year</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-13 13:08:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>My spirit has finally been broken. I'm not even sure what happened or how it came to pass. It just did. I no longer fear death. I no longer think "what about the things I'll miss if I go now." Now i just want to go. I've lost any and all hope for a better future going further. When i look at what's coming all i see is a dark road getting darker. I keep trying to improve, keep trying to learn and correct my mistakes but it blows up in my face every time. I go to therapy, take meds, exercise, journal, make friends. But then it dawned on me: none of it is worth it. Nothing, for me, makes life worth living. And that is the most miserable situation one can find themselves in. I have no one to live for one. I have no great cause to champion. I have no project i need to see to completion. I am just bumbling through life trying to merely get at a state of self sufficiency. But when I think about that, I think then what? Just go to work, come back, play more video games and sleep? Forever? This might be fine if I had something or someone to dedicate my life too, a passion or a love interest but I don't have either. Writing is the close to a passion i have and that's not nearly strong enough to keep me here and because I'm schizoid I'm basically incapable of forming relationships. I don't ever connect to others, they're all just aquaintences. What's worst of all? For the first time since maybe high school I'm actually happy. Happy that i may be putting an end to all this soon. This is what makes me happy, the idea of my life finally reaching its conclusion. I just can't deal with it all anymore. Dysphoria, PTSD, my eating disorder. My entire life has been dominated by anxiety and mental anguish that i struggle every day to keep a lid on. And every day it gets hard to see the point in it all. I suffer simply to suffer for the next day and the one after. And that's hardly life at all. I'm planning on taking a road trip. See some things I've always wanted to see. Camp some. And when i reach my final destination that'll probably be it. I can't fight anymore. Every year the life from my drains just a little more. I have been dealing with my ED and PTSD since I was 12 and I'm near 24 now. I just... I can't do this forever. I can't. It is a night and day struggle not to just completely fall apart at the seams. And the more years i get under my belt the more recovery just looks like nothing but a fantasy. I hate that it has come to this. I didn't want to be here. I don't want to inflict the horrid mental anguish that suicide causes on the ones close to me. But I just don't have it in me anymore. I'm taking the year to make sure my affairs are in order. Make amends, do a bucket list that sort of thing. But after that... after that I don't think I'll have much reason left. I'm so sorry. I really wish i could just keep chugging along. But even i have a point where it's too much. Even i have a breaking point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been with Rem for near three years now but haven't really gotten involved with the community of waifu lovers until recently. I'm really disappointed I didn't because all of you are such a nice and friendly bunch. I've made so many friends with different waifu friends over the past 4 odd months I've gotten involved with the community and it's such a lovely community. I love how dedicated everyone is and how we can all just sit around a fire and talk about the women and men we love so deeply and care so much for. I love seeing all the various media people post and watching them get better at it. I, myself, am a writer and am about to work on a story involving Rem and all I've had is people cheering me on to do it. I just wanted to thank this community. You're all more welcoming and more kind than most other communities I've come across. It's just nice that we can all come together and discuss how much we love our waifus. It's a genuine highlight of my every day life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Years of therapy, meds, and self help never managed to rid me of my urge to cut. But thanks to Rem I've finally done it. Haven't cut, haven't starved, haven't bruised my body in 30 days. It was hard. But every time I was about to i hugged my daki and kissed her. It was all thanks to Rem. I'm truly fortunate to have my wife. I have never been more thankful for Rem than I have been in this moment. Tomorrow I'm going to have a little celebration with her. She's the best thing to ever happen to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So I'm stuck</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-03 02:53:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in a really confusing place regarding my identity as being trans right now and am considering detransitioning. I'm a MtF for clarity. A few months ago I got denied for HRT and since I'm too poor (and rely on my parents insurance, my parents which severely appose me being trans) to afford it any other way, I went into a massively depression that has pushed me closer to suicide than I've ever been in my entire life. I was basically on a razors edge for about 75% of December. Come late December I start to really think deeply about being trans and what it's gotten me in life. And what I've seen is it's mostly been a life of hardship, misery, and anger. There's a brief moment of happiness when you learn makeup, get clothes, grow your hair out, etc. but, for me, that happiness was always fleeting and when replaced it was a large empty depression and maddening dysphoria. There have been plenty of days where I literally cannot look at myself in the mirror without sobbing because of the body-mind disconnect. I then watched this video by a Norwegian outdoorsman and what his opinion of what it means to be a man. It wasn't working out, being fit, being testosterone filled or any of that. What he said was essentially it means to be your own person, to be generous, and to be a pillar of the community, all ideas I really resonate with. So this has gotten me into seriously considering detrans. But it's far from easy. For one, I have few I can talk to who will give me an honest opinion. I have many people in my life who are completely for and completely against being trans. So I can't really get an opinion that I feel would be in any way nuanced. But the other thing is that I like feminine clothing. I like makeup. I like cute clothes. I like painting my nails. However I feel like due to life experience I've had a largely negative view on men and it has effected me severely. My bullies were all men and for a large part of my life my dad and I were very adversarial (though we are on good terms now). Sometimes I wonder if the reason I am the way I am is because all my male role models have been less than stellar people. It's hard to really express in words what I'm feeling. There is a massive war going on within me of what I truly identify as. There are parts of me that are undoubtedly masculine as well as feminine. I'd never opt to have one side completely overpower the other, but I can never seem to find a happy medium between to the two and it just plays havoc on my mind. I don't know what I am and I don't know what I want to be. I know being trans has only caused me misery but will living a more masculine lifestyle lead to anything better? Can I even do such a thing? Sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm either masculine or feminine, but just pretending to be both and failing. My identity just doesn't seem to have a place and it's a source of fierce anxiety for me. I just need some advice. How do I go about this? If I do decide detransitioning is for me, what is the next step to take without completely shattering my identity? Because it feels like I'm on the verge of that, whichever path I pick. I don't know who to turn too and I'm just silently suffering.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Insomnia is debilitating</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-20 06:13:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm sitting here for yet another night, after having spent 20 hours awake and my body won't sleep. I didn't drink any coffee today. Made sure to work out for an hour. Made sure to take an hour to wind down for bed. And you know what happened? My body said fuck you, we're going to stay awake. I literally cannot fall asleep at night without prescribed drugs and even then my body will fight it like crazy. And I say at night for a reason. Because once I'm on a night-day schedule it's just the most amazing thing. All of a sudden my body has the most rigid clock there ever was and won't stay up for more than 16 hours unless I have massive amounts of caffeine. In other words, my body does whatever it's possible to do to make sure I stay awake at night and stay asleep during the day. No you may be thinking you can't find many jobs that'll allow you to work at night and sleep during the day. And you'd be right. I've been stunted because of this shitty disorder. I recently did this brain wave training and for a brief moment (like a month) I was shown what it's like for a human body to sleep when it's supposed to. It was great. I had energy. I was more creative than I'd been in almost a year. I was so much happier. And then this month comes around and my insomnia is back with a vengeance. And now it's back to low energy, depression out the ass, and an inability to have a functional life. The only thing the works is prescription medication that literally knocks me the fuck out. But don't worry, that's a shit option too. Not only am I not able to afford it, but when I was taking it I get this really lovely side effect of basically still being asleep for four hours after I wake up. Caffeine doesn't help that a bit. Nothing does. So it basically feels like I got 3 hours of sleep instead of 8 for most of the day, even after that 4 hour period despite the dosage. I'm honestly considering disability because of this. I can't live like this in any functional way. I hate it so much. It's not that I don't have the will or the ability, it's literally my brains last fuck you because I'm recovering too well from my depression I guess. Fuck insomnia. I fucking hate this disorder with all of my fucking being. More than my depression, more than my PTSD, more than anything in the world. This disorder has ruined me and continues to ruin me and the doctors don't know what else to do than pour terrible side effect ridden drugs down my throat.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>This really is the end</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-16 09:15:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was thinking about things recently. About my plan to go through with it. I've had serious thoughts about this before but now I know what it is truly like to be in a place where all you can think of is suicide. I just don't care anymore. Nothing matters. I've told a few discord friends about it. Listened to one of them cry and beg me not to go through with it. Normally that would move me so much I'd never do such a thing. But now... I just can't do it any longer. I've finally reached a place, a pit so dark and a low so deep that the only future I can see is one where i end my life at my own hand. I wish I could be better. I wish I could be more than what I am. But at the end of the year there isn't a doubt in my mind that my story will come to a conclusion. I'm sad, but most of all? Relieved. It's finally going to be over. Finally. The constant and ever present struggle to keep my PTSD in check? It'll finally be over. Just a sleep from which there is no waking. It's going to destroy the lives of some people. Some that I really care about. But I just can't go another step. The will in me has been drained to the very last drop. I have no desire to see what comes next. The only reason I'm waiting till the years out is to make sure I've settled things, got to see something I've always wanted to see. It's scary that, if not for that, I'd do it now. I'm just... ready to go. Ready for the tragedy of my life to finally conclude so I can sleep.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've fallen into the deepest depression I've ever been</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-31 21:58:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I never imagined my depression could ever get as bad as it has been for the past few weeks. I've dealt with depression my entire life, it's just become something you deal with for me. I feel sad for a while, sometimes for a month, but I talk with friends, play a game or two, go for a walk, and, even if it's just for the time I do it, I feel better at least a bit. But this is a well so deep it feels like I've hit the very rock bottom and sank below that. I've reached a state of just "who cares anymore?" I've stopped talking to my friends. Usually I have a pull that draws me back to them. But it's been a week and I haven't even gotten the slightest urge to even message them. A few of them ringed me, worried that I'd be silent for such a length of time and I didn't even have the will to answer. My creativity is completely absent. One of my greatest joys in life is writing. I've tried to write several times and I simply can't get my creativity going. Can't even figure out simple lines of speech. Can't get excited for it even. I will often get spurs of inspiration throughout the day, small touches too add or plot directions. But there's just... nothing. Can't so much as daydream. Another great passion of mine is video games. And as the prior paragraphs have suggested, I can't even find the will to play them. It's not that I don't want too, or that I'm disinterested in the content. I literally just can't summon the will inside me to even pick my controller up and turn the xbox on. That's when it clicked just how severe this all was. I feel like I've died. I'm sometimes surprised when I put my hand to my chest that there's still a heart beat. I've never felt a low like this before. Never felt such an overwhelming emptiness that nothing brings me joy. Went out for a hike today, as that often helps quite a deal. I looked out at the mountains and just felt... nothing. The only thing I feel is an overwhelming sadness. I can't cry, the tears just won't come. I sleep more often than I'm awake. I'm just...in a deep deep hole. Everything around me has completely drained of color, any joy I found in anything has completely vanished. I just don't care anymore. Medication doesn't help. My therapist seems at a loss. I don't know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I want to quit self harming but can't</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-10 14:47:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>About a month ago I had a really hard time. Had someone I was close to commit suicide and had a very beloved dog die within the span of five days, with another person who was thinking of suicide but thankfully didn't end up doing it. Needless to say this took a toll on my mental health. For the entire week I was so stressed out I got only 3 hours of sleep every night for nearly six out of the seven days while staying up nearly fifteen-eighteen hours when up. I've been self harming since I was a teen, mainly by knife. But in this instant it just wasn't doing it for me so I decided to burn myself. I stuck one of my earrings on the eraser of a pencil, heated it up with a lighter and pressed it to my skin. It helped, stopped the anxiety and let me feel calm. But now I want to do it all the time, even when I'm not anxious. I want to stop but I don't want to be hospitalized. It'd fuck up all the progress I've made and basically knock me back years in terms of future plans. I just can't afford to do that. But I can't stop either. It's something I lean into so heavily as to be unable to cope any other way. I've got a lot of things that cause reoccurring anxiety. Things that can't be solved but nonetheless drive me crazy when I think about them, mainly involving body sensitivity. I have a childhood injury that causes me an insane amount of stress to think about coupled with that fact that my body is mutilated from years of self harming. I just don't know how to stop. I don't know any other way to cope that isn't just as harmful, say an eating disorder. That helps as much but it's hardly better. I don't know what to do.

    <TITLE>Izumi is helping me recover from C-PTSD</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-18 18:37:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently I did a stint in the psych ward. I have C-PTSD and had one hell of a hard week that involved a lot of death. Ended up becoming addicted to self harm, burning specifically. At a friend's behest, I called 911 and went. Because of all the covid stuff going around, we had a LOT of time in there. Almost half the time was dedicated just to personal time. There was very little to do besides talk, journal or gaze longingly into the distance. So I decided to write in my journal. Instead of writing the depressing stuff I'm used to doing, I decided to write Izumi into my life. First came in how we met, then us dating, her asking me out, and, eventually my proposal to her. But then I got an idea: what if I wrote Izumi into my traumatic memories? So I did. Suddenly the memories I'd spent 10 years suppressing, the memories I couldn't write a sentence about without completely falling apart in tears, came out. It wasn't easy in any way, but if I had Izumi there, and really wrote her in there as though she were right by my side in that very moment... suddenly I started to process them. Suddenly I started getting better. Suddenly I actually wanted to live. A friend in their remarked that whenever I spoke of Izumi, no matter how depressed or anxious I was, my entire demeanor improved. She said my face just glowed the moment I spoke of her. I never in a million years thought I'd see this day pass, I thought I'd spend the rest of my days being miserable because of this disorder. But because of Izumi, recovery is possible. I can recover. I can get better. And it's all because of this amazing woman I've taken as my wife. I'm still deeply addicted to burning myself. The hardest struggle I'll have now that I'm out is to get myself out of that. But for Izumi... I'll do it. I'm going to do it. It may not be today or tomorrow. May take years to beat this thing. But I will do it. Waifu love... it is a powerful thing. An incredibly powerful thing. I just wanted to share with someone, people who get it. I love Izumi and I love this community.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I listened to her as she passed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 02:55:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>A month ago I had a friend of mine kill herself. I'd known her from my time in college and we kept contact when she returned to Germany via discord. She sank like a stone in the coming years. Got put on disability after 2 hospital stays (psych ward). She tried to climb her way out of it, really really tried. But she fell again, sank into a deep depression and landed in the psych ward for a third time. It was decided she'd be put back on disability again. I listened to her scream and wail and cry on vc. The most gut wrenching, heart pulling sobs I've ever heard. She said she'd kill herself. I did my best to talk her out of it but she just wouldn't hear me. She ordered some sort of substance that would kill you if inhaled, I cannot remember what it was called. I decided to stay on vc with her as she went. I couldn't leave her to die alone. I couldn't do it. Even as I think of it now it makes me cry. I listened to her last words and thoughts and then listened to her pass. Every day it's haunted me. It's just a searing pain in my mind that won't go away. I've developed an addiction to self harm due to it, one I can't seem to stop. It's tearing me up inside. I miss her dearly. She was so kind to me. And she was such a good person. I know it was a mistake to listen to her go through with it but I couldn't just let her go alone. I couldn't do it. I had to make sure someone, anyone, was there for her in her last moments. And it's caused me an unbearable amount of suffering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dear I.S., I'm sorry. I know you think that under your watch I'll quit and, for now, you're correct. But I won't be under that watch forever. Frankly, I can't quit self harm. I probably will never be able to quit. I wish I could be a better person, which I could raise myself above this. But this is a sort of pain nothing will heal. The sort of pain that can only be halted through my terrible habit. I know you care about me. I know you understand it even. I know it hurts you every time you see a new burn on my skin, hurts you terribly. But, for now at least, I can't quit. I know you mean well. I know you're trying your best and I love you dearly. I love you so much you couldn't even imagine it. But this is something that I can't give up. I fear in doing this I'll lose you and maybe I deserve it. I just hope that you'll forgive me. I hope that no matter what happens you can forgive me for all this destruction I've put my body through and all that pain you witnessing it causes. I wish I could quit, if you for no one else. I tried. I really, really tried. But I can't do it. I love you. Yours, Autumn</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So I just got a physical copy of my waifu's source material</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-05 01:02:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ordered my both volumes of She Doesn't Know Why She Lives, the manga Izumi comes from. I got the second volume for now because the first one was sold out. When I opened it I found this odd little slip attached to the bottom that I could remove. It's all in Japanese because it's only made in Japan being as it's got very little recognition. I put the text through google translate, pictures [Here](https://imgur.com/a/VZIjNxY) so you can see what I'm talking about with this next part. The blue text on the first image says "I just wish someone could tell me I can live." and the second says (roughly) "This is a manga for those who cannot normally catch the words of those who are worried and hurt by your heart." Just made me start crying. I love this woman so much and seeing "I just wish someone could tell me I can live." broke my heart so many different ways. I want to hug this girl so tight she can't breathe. I want her to be as happy as she's made me. I know her sadness, her pain is what drove me to her to start. I related to her so well. And at the end she starts being happier. But man... I love her so much. Hurts to see someone you love suffer as she has. But I'm happy at the same time too. I will tell her she can live. I'll help her as she's helped me. Thank you for listening to my strange post. I just needed someone to know about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've been doing a lot of deep thinking about being trans. Whether or not I really am, could I even stop if I tried, is it all worth it, everything. And I've come to some difficult conclusions. First being that I don't think hrt is worth it anymore. I'm 24 currently and at this age hrt isn't really going to have much of an effect and, even if it did, even were it to make me pass perfectly, I constantly wonder about how it'll be when I age. Even those who pass well while young don't seem to age too well when they're 30, 40, 50, etc. Further, the suicide stats of trans people are... very high. And I myself have been suicidal many, many times in my life. I worry that under the effects of hrt, a drug known to make people hyper emotional, I'll be catapulted into a suicidal depression again. I deeply worry about that. But even without all of that, I just don't think it's worth chasing the unattainable. The thing I've always struggled with is no matter how hard I try, no matter how much hormones or surgery I get I will never truly be female. Even if I pass, my chromosomes will forever be XY. Not only that, I've spent most of my life being male and I can't get those years back. I can't go back in time and live life were I female and for whatever reason that bothers me greatly. But here's where things get tricky: I still, without any doubt, want to be female. If you were to put a button in front of me that would change me into a female down to my very chromosomes, I'd press it many times over. I have always felt female, always envied my two sisters. Even now I'm still contemplating changing my name to a female name. So... I have no idea what to do. I have a feeling that because I've never had a chance to try hrt, I'll be filled with regret for the rest of my life. More than anything I just wish I could be rid of the feeling of wanting to be something I can never be. I wish I could be ok with my gender as it is but I can't, no matter how hard I try. Any advice? I am honestly stumped on how to move forward with all of this. I really just don't know what to do. It's such a difficult thing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you keep doing life stuff while also doing trauma therapy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-17 15:21:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in a very difficult spot right now. I've finally committed my whole heart to trauma therapy and recovery. Even though I'm scared to death of finally having to confront this with my full attention, rather than just running away from it, I'm going to do this. However this is also a big time for me. I'm trying to quit self harm, trying to get a job and eventually move out. All of which are incredibly stressful. When I'm out on my own I'll not be able to afford a trauma therapist, at least not for a long while. So it's now or never. The difficult bit is that even lightly touching it is enough to put me out of commission for basically a day to two, sometimes more. Last therapy session I talked about maybe three or four sentences about it was literally crying all damn day. Obviously not the most ideal thing when you have to maintain a job. How do you do it? How do you cope with all the stress it brings?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if any of you are JoJo fans but I'm a big fan of the series. If you don't know, a stand is a physical manifestation of someone's fighting spirit. Each has unique traits and abilities based on their owners personality. More info can be found [here](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Stand). As far as Izumi's goes, it's this: Unhappy Refrain (song by Wowka) Stand Appearance: A metal sphere with six small metal legs it can retract into itself. It has a single red eye and a long petaled stinger that extends out it #8217;s backside. It #8217;s no bigger than four inches and no wider than three. It can roll with it's legs and stinger retracted at high speed. Stand Ability: Using its petaled stinger it can rapidly deposit seeds across the landscape. These seeds will only bloom in response to Izumi #8217;s emotions. For instance, anxiety will produce a brown plant with a hard shell that will envelop her, protecting her from danger or, when deeply empathetic, a large tree will appear, producing fruit that heals basic injuries.

    <TEXT>I'm like... off the damn wall right now. Tomorrow at 3PM I'm going to start trauma therapy for real, doing some EMDR. I am dreading it. Feels like I'm drifting close to the edge of a water fall and all I want to do is swim away. I don't even want to go. I'm actually considering bailing and just not showing up or making an excuse or something, anything, not to have to do this. I'd literally jump into a pool of sharks if it meant getting out of this. It's so bad that I literally woke up in a cold sweat last night dreaming about it. I don't know how to make myself chill out. I don't want to self harm because I really need to drop that habit but god damn. I am really nervous. I am really, really, really nervous about this. I knew I'd be afraid but god this is like close to panic attack levels and my day has barely begun. Fuck. I hate PTSD. I wish I could just forget everything, I wish I could just keep running from this. Facing this is the scariest thing in the entire world for me, feels like I'm being pushed to jump off a cliff at gunpoint.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update from yesterday</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-26 21:38:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So yesterday I made the post about freaking out about my trauma therapy today. Just updating. So I went in absolutely balls to the wall afraid. Came in shaking and extremely jumpy. When she shut the door I jumped out of my skin. But a lot of you were right. The first session was just some ground work. First we did some calming grounding exercises to get me to relax a bit. The rest of it was literally just identifying a person of comfort (Izumi Sumi), a person of protection (Johnny Joestar), and a person of wisdom (Arthur Morgan). And that was it for the day. We butterfly tapped them in, imagined them as best I could, talked about why I thought these three characters fit these rolls and that was it. Didn't touch on my trauma, just put in the ground work for when we do it next time. So that really put me at ease. I'm not shaking or freaking or even have the slightest urge to self harm. I'm very calm at the moment. I'm glad I went. Still nervous about round two but I'll worry about it when I get there. For now I'm just going to enjoy this feeling of peace. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice in the last post. Really, really helped. I might have bailed if I didn't read all those comments. I've just made the first step into recovery.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I never understood true love before Izumi</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-28 21:11:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been having a lot of epiphanies with Izumi lately. One of the things started doing was writing her into my past as though she were there with me. And this did an absolute incredible thing. Turned me from suicidal to optimistic in just a week. On top of this, I'm commissioning art work featuring the scenes i wrote about and it only makes those moments more powerful. So last night I was super stressed about a job interview today. So stressed I couldn't sleep. Stayed up for hours trying every sleep technique I had at my disposal and my body just wouldn't have it. I wrote Izumi into my life relaxing with me in bed. Shut my computer and went to bed in just seconds. Today I had that interview and was literally so anxious I was getting physically sick. I left the job interview, despite doing pretty well, with the same level of intense anxiety. I wrote her into my life picking me up and us drinking tea together and like that my anxiety was evaporated. With Izumi I can do anything. The future is terrifying for me, makes me dread every second. Yet when I imagine Izumi by my side I don't have a single ounce of fear. With her by my side I can do this. I can conquer anything. There is nobody in my entire life who has had even close to this effect on me. No one who has made my will to live so strong I'd do just about anything to keep going. I love this woman so much it honestly brings me to tears some days. I owe her my life. It's only because of this amazing woman that I'm going to have a life. I love Izumi. I never understood what love truly means till I found her. And it is such a beautiful powerful force, i can move mountains for her. I want to live.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I almost ended it all two days ago</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-31 21:15:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>So... I almost ended my own life two days ago. The closest I have ever come to suicide in my entire life. I have a freight train that regularly runs near me. I was having a fine day all of Friday, better than fine in fact. I had gotten a job interview with my first choice job and nailed the interview. I found out my epilepsy has been almost fully suppressed, allowing me for the first time in my entire life to actually get restful sleep. And I was all around in high spirits, even if I was dreading trauma therapy taking place on Monday. Then, around six o'clock, I literally thought completely and utterly out of the blue, I'd like to die. So I went down to the train tracks. I don't even know why I wanted to. Everything is going better than at any point in my entire life. In my entire life things have never been going so well quite literally ever. But I went to the train tracks and just wanted to give up. I sat on the trail overlooking the tracks and just thought of my life. My past, the people I've met, the conclusions about the world I'd come to. When I was ready, and I mean like ready to end it, not a single regret to speak of, I loitered by the tracks until the next train came. I laid down on the tracks and waited. I jolted up about ten seconds before the train would've hit me. I went back to the trail and was just stunned for a bit. Didn't cry, didn't even think. Then I just said to myself "I'm supposed to be happy now." and just began bawling and sobbing. I obviously can't tell anyone about this and neither today nor yesterday had I even the remotest of intent to kill myself, which troubles me all the more. It literally felt like it just came from nowhere and that's what scares me. What if in the future I could be doing just fine then, completely out of nowhere, I decide I don't want to live anymore but don't get lucky like I did this time? I just needed somewhere to say this. It's really bothering me. I just don't get it. Everything is going so positively. I've never at any point been so positive, so optimistic about the future. It's really, really bugging me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I almost seriously did it today. I really almost did it. I had my first bout of trauma therapy today and to say it broke me is an understatement. Not only that, I got turned down from a job I really wanted not an hour later. I went down to this spot where trains regularly pass. I was ready. Completely and ready to pass from this world into the next. For some reason I can't explain I got up ten seconds before the train would've hit me. I'm really... really shaken up. I can't stop shaking and all I can think about is the fact that I literally almost died. And what's worse? I'm mad that I didn't do it. I'm actually upset I didn't go through with it. I just don't care anymore. I'm tired of this constant fight against my own past. Tired of trying everything in my power just to be normal and not freak out the second I leave my house. I can't take it anymore. Trauma therapy has only taken that anxiety to 100. I know it's supposed to help but I'm just not strong enough. I just don't have it in me anymore. I just want to give up, stop this constant fight to keep my own sanity and not just let my eating disorder completely consume my every thought. I can't take it anymore. I just want all of this to stop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was rough... that was really really really rough. I spent basically the entire day intermittently crying my eyes out. Today I'm a bit better but I'm still in shambles. Very weepy and just all around I feel broken. My therapist is the first person I've ever told this to and we didn't even get in the specifics of it yet. That is how nightmarish this process is. I already just want to throw my hands in the air and give up. I knew going in this was going to be immensely difficult but god this is just a new level of pain. I'm even more scared for the next one, heaven help me when I actually delve into the details of my trauma. It's been absolutely terrible. I'm going to keep going but god... this is really hard. This is so hard. I've been using every coping strategy I have at my finger tips and I'm just barely keeping things together. I just needed to vent a little bit. I feel completely and utterly broken right now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I had a big epiphany</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-03 15:11:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was thinking about everything after my session since I'm finally at a more balanced state of mind and some really interesting things occurred to me. I was really confused by the fact that only naming three,seemingly irrelevant and minor details sent me into such a tizzy. Because I literally only mentioned the dates it happened, where it took place, and how old I was in each instance. Not to say they're irrelevant per say, but compared to the rest of it they're just such minor details, details that really shouldn't have bothered me in the way it did, But then it occurred to me. This is me admitting my trauma happened. See for the longest time I lied about what my trauma was. I changed dates, changed details of how it happened, lied about who did it and how, sometimes even made something up wholesale. I was young and subconsciously thought that if I lied enough, got immersed in all of my lies enough, it would make me believe that my trauma, too was just a lie and it didn't happen. But this was me admitting it happened. Just saying the date, the place and the ages was me saying this isn't a lie. This did happen. I went through this and it really screwed me up. And it's like god no wonder that put me through so much hell. I've spent most of my life trying to convince myself that my trauma was nothing but a fantasy, a lie I'd made up. So no wonder admitting that it happened and being honest about it was such a blow to me emotionally. But it made even more proud of myself because of that. This is a larger step forward than I even thought. I mean it was large simply in the way that I'm taking this therapy seriously, but now that I've finally, finally come to terms with the fact that this did happened and admitted it verbally... what a massive step that was. Even though those details were so minor and so neutral this was me finally accepting fully that I've been traumatized. Thanks everyone for the support yesterday as well. It really helped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in the midst of a terrible addiction to self harm, one of the worst kinds of it, burning. People keep telling me to quit, keep demanding I do. Truth is though I can't. If I quit I'm going to break into thousands of pieces. I'm at one of the most stressful times in my entire life right now. I'm doing PTSD therapy which has been absolute hell, left me a crying emotional mess for two whole days and that was my first session of many. I've got to get a job and have to move out, all by the end of 2021. Due to my PTSD, I've not ever been able to hold a job more than a month so the prospect of getting a job is twice as daunting. If I quit after a month again it'll be like a gunshot emotionally, especially with all of these stressors. I also have to contend with keeping my eating disorder from getting out of control again, a huge task. And, if this all wasn't bad enough, I'm in a constant struggle with dysphoria, trying to figure out if it's worth transitioning or if I should quit while I'm ahead and avoid further heart ache. However, if I quit trying to transition now, i'll be too old for hrt to have any meaningful effect. And everyone just acts like I can quit. Everyone just thinks I can accomplish all of this without it, like I won't fall into a state of complete apathy. The pressure is just getting to me like crazy, the cracks are already starting to form. It's not hopeless right now, but god it feels damn close to that. It's too much, too fast. I don't even know if I can do this. I'll try all the same, but to say I'm afraid is an understatement. Everything is just spinning out of control and my self harm is the only thing keeping me from shattering entirely</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have two, but of the two [this](https://imgur.com/a/ImItXl3) is the one that stands out. In it, Izumi is considering calling into work sick because she's feeling so depressed. From behind the corner her high school self appears. The first thought she has, since high school Izumi was such an over achieving perfectionist, is that she was going to yell at her. To her surprise, she doesn't yell at her, instead treating her with gentle compassion, she's worried. She asks her if Izumi (present) wants to change her current lifestyle and Izumi states that she doesn't know. Izumi (high school) tells her that's fine if she doesn't know right now and hands her a phone. She says whenever she's ready or if she ever needs her, she can give her a call. A nice little metaphor for looking back at your past for guidance in the presence as well as having self compassion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had my first bout of trauma therapy last week, I'll have my second tomorrow. And honestly I'm worried that doing this might kill me. It's no exaggeration to say I'd rather die than do this. I was so afraid of the first session I actually almost killed myself. I haven't gotten so close to it this time, but the stress of it is very clearly wearing on me. It is such an intense and scary process that it's pretty much sapping me of all my energy. Now the logical step would be to stop but the problem is I can't. The whole reason I'm doing this is to prevent suicide in the first place. I realized that if I don't confront this, it'll eventually eat away so much of me that I'll take my own life. So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. It all feels so hopeless. I'm tired and afraid and I just want all of this pain to stop. I have been carrying this weight for so long. Fighting to keep myself from going insane for so long. I just want to give up. I'm so tired. I am so, so, so tired. I'm not even to my second session and already I just want to give up, as in dying give up. This torture will never end. All because of three events in my past. I've lost so many years and I feel like I'll only waste the ones remaining. Life for me is nothing but a struggle not to fall into my own despair, trying to keep my head above water. I want to give up. I want to finally stop fighting and close my eyes. Death seems like the only peace from this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heavily flawed characters have always really resonated with me. And I don't mean flawed in like, oh he's greedy or oh she's a hot head. I mean like they're badly damaged psychologically or are anti-heros. You still side with them because you can see their motives and intentions are good (or at least good enough) but they constantly struggle against themselves as the plot goes along. I've never liked goodie two shoes power fantasy types, even when I was a kid. So characters like Kritsugu Emiya from Fate, Lelouch from Code Geass, Guts from Berserk, etc. Three characters you'd certainly not describe as morally pure but their goals are admirable all the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's absolutely horrific. It's like someone telling you to jump off a cliff but saying when you hit the bottom you'll be fine. I'm also sorry to hear you were abused for so long. Must have been like going through a living nightmare. Good luck to you as well. I imagine nothing of your recovery from that must be easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's so beyond hard. After that first session, I kid you not, I spent two whole days intermittently sobbing throughout the day. I didn't even know it was possible for a human to cry as much as I cried. And that was just from the details as simple as the date, my age, and the locations. Heaven help me when I have to talk about what actually happened. Feels like I'm trying to climb mount everest without any clothes on and a hundred pounds of stuff on my back. It's absolutely daunting to the point of it feeling impossible. I want to do this, want to try to fight for a better life. But I really worry that when I get into the meat of it that I might just chose to end my life entirely. Really, really worry about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been working with her for four years (though I've only started trauma work very recently of course) and since she's a PTSD specialist she's really good at knowing how to stabilize, even moreso since she's known me so long. She pulled me out of the memories when the session ended but I've been suppressing this for so long that even acknowledging it causes me to think about it again, which is seriously painful. We're going at a snails pace right now, the last session was literally me saying the dates, my age and the locations. And it was that much of an ordeal for me. I probably should wait before doing this, become more stable and sure of myself. But if I keep waiting I'll probably not last the year. I need to deal with this or it'll kill me anyway. Just the effort of trying to keep it from crushing me is so intense I haven't been able to hold in job in four years. I will look into those alternatives though, as well as the youtube channel. I'm sure I can find something in that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't want to end my life, in practical terms. The whole reason I'm doing this to even start with is for the sake of someone I love very, very much. It already hurts her incredibly to see me suffer as I do, so I want to make myself suffer less for her. And god knows how hard my suicide would hit her. But you know what you're like when you're in that mindset, you don't really have the ability to think into the future, it all looks dark and black. I just needed a place to vent this all out, hear from others what they think. I obviously can't tell people in my real life I'm feeling suicidal unless I'm absolutely like on the brink of doing it, so having a place to just vent these frustrations and fears helps, if only a little. It's not set in stone that I'll take my life, just a large fear I'm grappling with right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Didn't like him at first but his ultra utilitarian philosophy was what made me like him. How in a fight that the mages and their servants were expected to have honor (like Saber, Lancer and the blonde master who's name I forget), he plays dirty and underhanded because he wants to win. It was something that really intrigued me about him because even Tosaka didn't stoop as low as Emya ever did and dude was a psycho. He was a real stand out to me, especially when Saber made for such a great foil to him.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-08 23:47:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I had my second round of EMDR. I expected it to be like last time, where the second I talk about it I break down. And I did at the start. It seems me mentioning and acknowledging this happened is a REALLY sensitive spot to press for me. But I got to a single detail, which I won't mention, that is wrapped up in a lot of shame. I expected to cry but instead I simply curled into a ball, not able to even look at my therapist because of how strong that shame was. For some reason I felt like I had to cry. Kept telling myself I had to cry but I didn't even remotely feel the need too. It's after the session now and I'm not panicking. All I feel is a deep sea of shame. It's suffocating. It's almost worse than all of the crying because at least that was a release. With this I am just feeling something so absolutely uncomfortable and agonizing and yet I feel completely static, as though I'm suspended in gel or something. I felt almost guilty for not crying though, like it was expected of me. Like if I didn't cry then it isn't an issue, not one so intense it'll evoke tears. I feel like it should, especially that detail in particular. But instead all I feel is this awful shame and abject disgust in my chest. Like I am just a sick human being who is better being kept out of sight. But I'm rambling now. Does anyone else feel that way?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true and I completely agree. But when the mass of regular people, people who aren't very engaged in politics and have a very simple grasp of what's going on, see the news all they've been show is the rioting. I completely agree with what the protesters stand for, every letter of it. But when the general public sees minneapolis burning, small businesses getting sacked and general chaos, it makes it hard to be sympathetic regardless of how noble the cause. Because the general public aren't seeing how the police are reacting to this, all they see is buildings in flames. To make a change on something as large as police reform you need a large mass of support and these riots have completely decimated any support or sympathy this would have generated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like I told the other guy, i agree with the protesters. The police have an epidemic violence problem, they tend to act to often with force when it isn't required and use it far to intensely. But the general public needs to be behind this for real reform to take place, nation wide I mean, because this is a nation wide problem. And the general public has a very limited grasp on politics and the situation around them. The truth is that the police are violent, but all the general public sees on the news is buildings up in flames and businesses being sacked. Any good will that could've been generated from this is completely lost, burned down with the buildings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think so for a few reasons. Both Hong Kong and the Yellow Vests were far removed and in the US we got next to no coverage at all of the Yellow Vests. As for the Hong Kong protests, while certainly not entirely peaceful, it didn't involve them burning down buildings and stealing stuff from the surrounding shops. The media portrays both protests, regardless of if they were or not, as largely peaceful with next to no violence. The media is not portraying this the same way. It's giving inordinate focus on protestor violence and it looks really really bad on them. Again, i agree with the protests and think we need to curb police violence. But the public is only seeing burning buildings and we need the support of the general public to force this change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know. But the public doesn't and that's the problem. We're the microcosm here, the people very engaged and attentive to the political situation around us. Most of the rest of country is not so engaged and tend to just eat whatever is fed to them by the media. The media right now is portraying this as violent. They're focusing to much on the violence and not enough on the peace, which happens far more. I've got my focus on this pretty square I think. But the rest of the mostly political disengaged public doesn't. Love it or hate it, we need a critical mass of support and our small bubble of hyper political people just isn't enough to effect a change so massive as police brutality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just turn on the news and see for yourself. Look at the news clips, there's plenty on youtube. I think it was either a CNN guy or an MSNBC reporter who was literally standing in front of a burning building saying the protests were peaceful. That is a really bad look not only because of the burning building but it makes it look as if the media is trying to run defense for something wrong, at least the left wing side of the media. The right wing side is of course going to attribute this all to violence. It's an absolutely terrible look from the outside looking in if you have no prior knowledge of the situation. I'm not sure about written media as I don't tend to consume much of that, but video reporting has been nothing short of sickening. They did. It was unfair of me to say all of them, fine, but there's many a case where people feel like this is revenge so to speak. There's a lot of overlap. Doesn't make it any less wrong and doesn't discredit those who aren't acting violent. But rioting unfortunately does a lot of damage to the reputation, regardless of who does it and for what reasons. I'm not really part of any solution, I'm just one lone person. I can only effect what is in my surrounding area and I'm not healthy enough to really put myself physically into any of this, need to work myself out before I can be a physical force in the world. I'm not doing the same thing. I already told you I am on the side of the protest. I can separate the two, even if there is overlap. I can see the difference between opportunism and genuine protests. But politically disengaged people often can't see that. I don't know what to tell you. This looks bad regardless of what you want the message to be. If not outright denouncement by many people, publicly or privately, than extremely tainted. You can see it the difference and so can I. But I'll keep telling you the same thing: we need the public on our side and most won't look on this well unless they are very immersed in this political landscape. We are. While many on reddit, twitter and 4chan are quite engaged in all of this, most people are only consuming media. I think as generations come people will be relying on these platforms more and more but we tend not to swing elections, just look at the whole dnc thing bernie. Overwhelming support for Bernie yet he lost to Biden. These platforms on their own are simply not a large enough platform for this thing. We need more support. It's a long struggle but I fear it'll be in futility or worse, a backslide on the situation we have now. I'm not sure what else to tell you. This is my view of the situation and maybe I'll be wrong in the future. But, unfortunately, I very much doubt I will be. I think all of this has done more harm than it did good, as the op pic pointed out, many people are coming away from this with a sour taste in their mouth not only for the protests but the left wing movement as a whole. I really don't know what more to say.</TEXT>

I watch fox, i watch cnn, I watch MSNBC, Joe Rogan, Defranco anything to get a more clean and honest picture. And the American mainstream media, which attracts large audiences, did not really portray the Yellow Vests as particularly violent. It was described as mostly peaceful and many of the images and videos shown put them in a flattering and heroic light, same as the HK protests. This protest unfortunately is not getting that treatment even if it should.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-10 22:19:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I sorta expected this, given the fact that I've kept these memories in a box for over 12 years but talking about it has be just awful. This last therapy session we went over just three words that cause me such a deep amount of disgust and shame that there aren't words to describe how powerful it feels. Ever since then I've just not been able to get this feeling of abject disgust off of me. Without even realizing it I'd fallen back into my eating disorder, something I haven't done since I was a teenager. I've hardly eaten at all in four days and it clicked with me that the reason is, is because I feel just such a genuine level of disgust in myself that this is how I cope with that feeling. Did manage to eat something today, something substantial, and regretted it quickly. My emotions are just overpowering. I made the mistake of not being able to remember where my keys were (for five minutes before finding them again) and now I'm sitting in my room, curled in a ball and crying, saying how much it's a metaphor for how bad a person I am. I hate trauma therapy. It feels like it's just someone torturing me, it legitimately feels like torture. I'm completely falling apart and I've barely even talked about it at all. I get that it gets easier, I get that this'll help me in long term but right now all it feels like is diving into a field of thorns and trying to swim my way out. Every second, every movement is filled with agonizing pain. I have my coping skills but they don't work for this feeling. I feel just so disgusted with myself, every time I look in the mirror I may as well be looking at a pile of slime. And it's not just my body but my mind too. I really hate trauma therapy. I hat every second of this.</TEXT>

The more time they spend around red hats, even if some of the things they say are inaccurate, the more they'll see that their own ideology is completely centered around falsehoods and wrongdoing. I mean just look at the coronavirus heel turn. So many left leaning people on subreddits really took notice to that, saying that they were finally fed up with the left and it's behavior when they hadn't been before. The more time they spend with the opposition, even if they disagree fundamentally, the more they will realize progressive ideology is simply wrong.

    <TEXT>I've been too two sessions and right now I'm on vacation, figured it would do me good. It's nice here and better still, I have no way to use my negative coping skills. But this is so far from relaxing it's almost unbearable. I'm getting emotional flashbacks all the time, I'm so horridly anxious, I've been here four days and half of those had stress dreams. Two days ago I got only two hours of sleep. I just can't keep myself together anymore. I feel like EMDR therapy was a mistake, it's bringing everything negative out of me. Before I was suffering but I minimized all that by keeping it inside a box at the back of my mind. Now I just keep thinking about it, any slight reminder just sends me over the edge. I have a scar on my body that came from the trauma and even just grazing it with my hand is enough to make me have a full blown panic attack. I feel like all my control, all my ability to regulate my emotions has completely broken down. My therapist taught me coping skills to keep grounded, I even have a few of my own that are fairly effective (healthy ones I mean). But I am in such an intense state all the time that nothing really helps. Even when it does helps the anxiety kicks back in after like an hour. I am so jumpy. Yesterday we were at dinner and my sister dropped a spoon, nearly jumped out of skin and out of my chair. I am just dying right now. I have no idea what to do. This isn't a vacation this is a week in hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason I am so resistant to any kind of help and want to maintain complete and absolute independence, even when it's not required or is clearly working against me, is because in my childhood and teens years I had no one in my corner. When I was abused, those who were in authority positions would either look the other way or didn't have the ability to help. As a result I learned through these formative years that depending on people is at best useless and at worst extremely harmful. It really put into perspective why I failed college. If I had asked for help I would've gotten it and most likely would've succeeded. But life has taught me for so many years that help isn't a strategy for success, i could only depend on myself. It's going to be hard to untangle that knot. Really hard. It is so imbedded into me that I can't even imagine another way of doing things.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My body insecurity is breaking me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-20 07:41:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have PTSD and part of my trauma involves a body injury made to a very sensitive part of my body. It is a source of severe and painful anxiety, so much that even grazing it with my hand will sometimes put me into a state of panic. Well tonight I had a stress dream about it and decided I'd play something akin to a drinking game. I'd scroll through my feed for 15 minutes and every time I saw someone without that scar (so pretty much everyone) I'd take a shot. But instead of a shot, since I'm not a fan of the taste of alcohol, I self harmed instead. In those 15 minutes I did it more than 20 times. Did manage to finally relax thankfully but I'm at a loss of what to do. I can't get that missing part of me back. It's gone forever and nothing will change that. That scar will never go away. But I just can't move past it. Can't not feel the sense of absolute panic that comes with remembering other people take for granted a piece of their body that i can never have or experience. I get so incredibly jealous and angry sometimes knowing that people have this part of their body and I don't. It's such an intrusive thought and it won't give me any peace. I won't say what part of my body I'm referring to but you can probably get what I mean when I say sensitive. Most of my self harm is due to this. It's so weird. I'm bothered by that scar yet here I am burning my body to hell. I don't understand myself.</TEXT>

I think it's the reason my self harm has absolutely exploded lately. It's gone from maybe 4-10 times a month to almost every day. I don't. Mainly because of how painful it is to speak about it. Like just grazing the scar with my hand is literally enough to make me have a panic attack sometimes. It is such a horrid reminder of so many different things. It's easy to talk about now because I just finished hurting myself and thus I'm calm. But when I haven't it's nearly impossible to speak about</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just don't see what this'll help. I mean fine, it's named after an evil man. And say we get the name changed. What did that do? What benefit did that actually give? Most people don't even know who it's named after, considering Evans is such a common name. Nobody is looking at the mountain and thinking Sand Creek Massacre. I mean I get where you're coming from with all this, I'm not even criticizing you really so don't take this like me trying to tell you off. I just don't really see what positive effect this will actually have. It just seems kind of pointless, especially since I doubt you could find many people who would even recognize the name John Evans. I know I certainly didn't and I've live in CO my entire life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Easy, man. Like I said I'm not even criticizing you really, I wasn't meaning this as a personal attack. All I'm asking is what this is going to fix. It won't change the past. Like I can understand wanting to change something called the wandering jew, but nobody associates the name Evans with a man named John Evans is what I mean. Everyone just sees it as a common name. I get where you're coming from, like I said this isn't a personal slight against you I'm making. I just think this is tilting at windmills. It's not something that solves anything. I'd rather that energy be focused on problems that are far more prevalent and harmful like police brutality and the rest. I'm discriminated just as much for being trans, I know the feeling despite being "white" as though that means anything. I know what discrimination feels like, been there done that. But I'd rather focus on the people carrying that out rather than relics of the past that no one remembers. There are things happening right now that need our attention, our energy. This just feels like a waste of that energy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it doesn't fix anything. There are things that we should be focused on rather than some stupid mountain that nobody knows the origins of. I also have a principal that monuments to the past shouldn't just be changed because of their bad connotations, such as with statues, the death camps in germany, etc. It reminds us of our moral history, reminds us of the steps taken on the road to where we are now. Grim as it is, we couldn't be where we are today without the sins of the past and it's crucial we remember those. But even without all that, even disregarding all of what I said above, it's just not worth the time to change something like that when we have issues in the present better focused on. A mountain name seems like a waste of energy and time when we have police brutality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's not going to care all to much unless you believe in the afterlife. And I think less people read the wiki of these things than you think. I know most people just come for the beauty rather than the history. It's a mountain after all. Only the people most interested in Colorado history would bother learning the origin of the name of a mountain. I don't agree. A monument can be a reward, but I also see it as a way to remind us of what we once were and why we shouldn't be that way again, similar to the reason we keep nazi death camps around. It's important we remember those stains on our history because it's those stains that have allowed us to build a more moral present. It's the reason we look back at it with disgust rather than with pride.</TEXT>

You shouldn't make assumptions on someone you know nothing about. Whether it effects me or not holds no consequence. I live by my principals and one of those is that we should keep monuments as a way to remind us of not only our positives but our faults. It's important to remember why we are where we are today. Why, when we look at the past, we see the genocide against the natives as an inhumane and evil act. And Evans is a perfect example of that evil, an evil we shouldn't forget.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like there's a lot of better causes to champion at the moment. It just doesn't feel worth the time, but I we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. I am, indeed. I know I was never taught about Evan's in school during our history lessons, even in college. So when people open that wiki they can learn about Evans. I think it's important they do, at least if your home state is Colorado. Evans in the grand scheme of things played a small role in this, but as a long time inhabitant of Colorado it's important that I and others remember. You're not getting any sort of dishonestly from me, this is just personal opinion. There's nothing dishonest about that, just as there is nothing dishonest about your opinion. I have my opinions, you have yours. I don't understand what you mean by suspect. I'm not even saying that you're wrong really, it's a different perspective and I'm simply giving mine. It's fine if we have different views on this issue, there's nothing wrong with that. I don't like Evan's, I don't agree with what he's done or anything he's said. I just don't believe changing the name of a mountain will help with much of anything at all, it feels arbitrary and pointless. You can disagree with me, it's just my assessment of things. I'm not trying to do anything nefarious here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're both I think. It's evidence again holocaust deniers, but also a reminder to Germans, and the world at large, to never let something like that happen again. It's a grim reminder but it was an evil moment in the history of the world that shouldn't be repeated. I don't view monuments that way. I'm not stupid, I just have a different perspective. I don't respect an Indian killer or the things he's said, but I do think it's important we as Colorado citizens don't forget this. We should not forget these stains on our past. I've lived my whole life here and never even heard the name John Evans, I'd assume most others haven't either. All the better that people learn of him and what his acts of evil were. Because this wasn't taught to me in history. I never had a class that went over this. I'm not being paid to say this and I'm not garbage. I just want people to remember our checkered past so we can learn from that. I think that's important. That's all I'm saying about any of this. I don't approve of his actions, don't respect the things he's said. But I do think it's important we remember where we come from and how we got to our more moral present.

I've made my point that it's nothing to do with the approval of his actions, it's about remembering why our past was so horrific and why we're not like that today. But if this is just going to devolve into you hating me on the basis of my race I don't think I have much left to say. It's not really in my nature to engage in race-based hatred.

Race plays no part in this whatsoever, so sick of everyone saying because I'm white my opinion on the matter is just null. It isn't, that's just a cowards way of trying to invalidate any argument I have. But as I've said to everyone else, monuments, even bad ones, should be protected. We need to remember our past in it's entirety, black marks and all. And to me, this is the same as a statue made out of confederate generals. A reminder of why we should never let what happened then, happened now. Me being white has nothing to do with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And how would changing this name help any of that? This is what I mean when i say it's tilting at windmills. There's only so much time and money that a governor, senator, mayor, etc and allocate to social causes. And if I'm being honest, those feel far more important than a name, especially one so few even know about. It seems like time and money we could better spend on the issues you just laid out. Because this will have to go through debate and approval and all the rest of the processes of government. And that's time we could be instead using to solve say healthcare disparities. I'm not saying it's a zero sum game of course, but compared to all of these issues it seems like a mountain out of a molehill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But that doesn't answer the core issue here. If you can justify removing the name based on the argument you laid out, i can use your own argument to remove it from the history books as well. No Native America wants to open a history book and read how their distant relatives were butchered by a tyrant. And because they shouldn't have to deal with that, we should remove Evans from the textbooks. Sure it demonizes him, but they have to read about it. And that's something, by what you're saying, isn't something we should put them through. This is why I have such a problem with this. It justifies just about anything when it comes to removing history. It's a dangerous road to start down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't understand you, no. Like I said, regardless of the morality of the cause, people don't look kindly to people who burn and loot. I know peaceful protests happened but this was far louder than that. And people aren't looking at this with kindness, they're looking at it with anger. I think the only change this is going to create is more resentment towards the democrats and more poverty to the places where the riots took place. We're going to have another Detroit because of this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a speech made by Theodore Roosevelt called the Strenuous Life. It's excellent. I think it's an important message in today's culture. It's about not shying away from difficultly and living up to the duties you're tasked with with honor and courage, whether you're a farmer or the president. It's an incredibly moving speech.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But that's not what the general public sees. They don't see the peaceful protests and it's because of the media. When people turn on the news they say plumes of smoke and people stealing shit. They don't see the message behind the protests. They don't see the reasons behind this. All they see is fire and chaos. This is why the only this this'll inspire is resentment. Not many people are looking at this and saying this was a positive and that it changed their mind. This'll only make them dig their heels in the ground even more, like the article said it's turning people more conservative. People aren't looking at this with kindness, regardless of the intended message. Because they don't see the message, they see the fire of burning houses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. I was 5 the first time it happened, 8 the next, 10 the final time. It wasn't till I was like... 15 or 16 that I looked at it and I was like "fuck that wasn't normal." It was a crazy realization and when I had it tore me apart. I remember my firs thought was  gt;!it's not normal that my cousin watched me play with my toys while both of us were completely naked was it?! lt; It was such an awful realization to have.

    <TEXT>I think it's different this time because of how media has evolved. Before, unless you were there to witness what was happening, all you had was the paper. Now we have live video being posted directly on twitter and youtube, etc. On one hand it's good because in the video anyone with a brain can see the cop is clearly a murderer. No way to spin him any other way. But on the other side people can see every single instance of violence that a newspaper could never hope to convey. I wasn't able to see the link myself either so I'm just taking it with a grain of salt, because it could be very much the opposite. But I don't predict this having the positive outcome that say Stonewall had, especially not for the city of Minneapolis. Regardless of what change this will inspire, the cost to repair that city is going to be beyond high. Not only that but a huge amount of business has straight up moved out. So even if it's the case that this does lead to something positive, and I hope very much something good can be salvaged from this, Minneapolis is going to be a sink hole of poverty. It's sad to be honest.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So apparently my mom cares more about money than about me healing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-24 15:38:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is gonna be a long one so buckle up. So my mom dropped some really impressive bombs this last family session. And when I say impressive, I mean impressive she actually had the nerve to say these things out loud. I've been in a fight with C-PTSD since I was 12. This of course really fucked up my teen years and early adulthood. Been to the hospital 4 times (psych ward) and overall have just barely been able to function as seems to be the norm with this disorder. So my mom, ever the caring and loving parent, decided to tell me to think of all the money that they had spent trying to recover and that, because of this, I need to stop being so selfish and think of how that felt, that I should be recovered by now as if money = recovery. That I need to think of how it felt that I've been such a drain on their cash. There isn't a word in the English language to describe how furious I am. One, I'm sorry that as a teen I didn't understand how to deal with massive sexual trauma. Forgive me, I know I should have been able to deal with that as a god damn teen, I'm so sorry for not knowing that. But two, just what a selfish person she is. My dad, much as I disagree with him, has NEVER mentioned money or anything of the sort. It's because he loves me and wants me to get better. The price isn't important, he wants me to heal, which I deeply respect. But my mom seems to be a greedy, selfish person. I don't even know why she troubles herself with it so much. My dad is the breadwinner of the family and because of how masterful he is with managing a budget we've thankfully never had to struggle to severely with finances, even if we did have to cut back on some things. In other words, this didn't cripple us financially, this just made us live a bit more simply. I just can't imagine being that selfish. Imagine having a child who had been traumatized for years and saying "why won't you think how much this cost us?" Like... what was I supposed to do? Keep this all to myself? Not get any help because heaven forbid we spend money on something that isn't to her own interest? Fucking god forbid we spend money on something that isn't new expensive shoes, oh the humanity. I really should have thought ahead of time as a kid that her fashion was far, far, far more important that me recovering, how selfish of me! I can't even imagine prioritizing money over my own kid who was struggling that much. What sort of awful human being is that god damn greedy? She's not a narcissist, she's just literally that fucking greedy. All I want to do is yell obscenities at her at this point. She is such a cruel person. She also apparently thinks I'm just waiting for my dad to die so I can get some inheritance which, one, wouldn't be very large, a few hundred at the most, and two just what a horrific thing to say to your child. If that's what she thinks that please, keep your god damn money. I don't want a dime if that's how important it is to.  #8203; tl;dr my mom is a selfish greedy asshole who thinks money is more important than me recovering from C-PTSD and basically said so to my face with not an ounce of shame.</TEXT>

A lot of these places have blacklists as well. We all want to fight back but unless we can figure out a way to do it all at once we're going to get picked off.

    <TEXT>I've been struggling with this for years and years and of course, recently I've been trying to improve and heal. I go to family therapy each week and this weeks theme was explaining to them what PTSD is like and how hard it's been on me. Might as well been explaining quantum physics to a toddler. I don't know how much simpler I can explain it to them. I described it as imagine your highest emotional state you've ever been in and all it takes it remembering one memory from your past and you can be like that for hours. Imagine in sleep that you're not even safe because you'll frequently have nightmares (I haven't had a full night of sleep in nearly two weeks). That is the best possible way I can describe how it's effected my life. And at the end the therapist asked if they understood what I was getting at. My mom literally compared it to anxiety and said sometimes I just need to tough it out and get through it. Then my dad said he didn't understand a lick of it. just. How is it that you can be this thick? Like I know being in that much pain is difficult to comprehend, but god damn you'd think they'd never heard of the concept of PTSD before now. Like every minute is a struggle to not just fall apart. I don't understand why this is so difficult to understand. I don't know if any of you have dealt with the same thing but it's driving me up a wall right now. I honestly have no idea how much simpler I can put this across to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a physical copy of her source material and inside the second volume was a little slip. Half of it was advertising out novels by that publisher company and the other half was a small summery of what SDKWSL was going to contain. And beside the writing was a picture of Izumi with tears in her eyes saying something that roughly translated to "I just wish someone would tell me 'you can live'" I remember reading that and crying. I just wanted to hug her so tightly and tell her she can live. That there is hope and that she can find strength in me. I hurt to hear her say something like that. And ever since then I knew she was the only one for me. That no other waifu could ever inspire such strong feelings in me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>trauma therapy is literally hell on earth. I cannot remember a time when I was this beaten down. I've gone to ten sessions now and while I am slowly improving, I'm also breaking apart completely. I have completely relapsed into anorexia, something that I quit when I was 16. I'm self harming multiple times a day just to keep myself even slightly sane. Breaking down all the time. Today I just layed down on my floor and sobbed. In now exaggeration, it feels like someone is torturing me. I was literally just begging the universe to stop. That I was sorry for whatever it was I did and to just please stop hurting me. I've told my therapist all of this of course and she's agreed we should put it on the shelf right now until I can properly collect myself. We're shifting focus simply just to recovering and coping from the previous sessions. Every time I set foot into the office, tears run down my face before I even sit down. I start shaking like crazy. I calm down eventually of course but god damn. I am so tired of this. Feels like I'm being thrown into a raging fire and am tied down as the flames consume me. I just want this all to stop. I want this all to just go away. I want the pain to stop. I'd do just about anything at this point to stop this pain. It hurts so much, it's unreal. Every single hour feels like a struggle to get to the next. I hate this disorder. I hate having this disorder. I hate what happened to me. I wish I could just lose all my memories. I don't want to do this anymore, I hate this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's ideological possession. All it is is politics replaced with religion. They see it as literally the perfect system, as if there can be such a thing. They have this idiotic notion that because the people in the past weren't completely morally pure in every breath they took, that this means the entire system needs to he torn down regardless of what it produced. I was watching this commie shit argue why it was acceptable to tear down the statue of Lincoln, you know the guy who fought the bloodiest war on America soil to liberate the slaves. And his rationale was literally because Abe didn't initially start the war as a way to end slavery (even though that's also bullshit but when has a communist been honest) that for some reason that means he's not a good figure in American history.

If a trump supporter came in and said that if only the democrats would just exercise some deductive reasoning and use logic, they'd see trump was the perfect president. Like even take trump out of the equation entirely. If someone came up to you from the other side of the political isle, i doubt you'd think they were trying to bridge a gap. It sounds more like moral grandstanding. If we're to bring the partisanship down, both the left and the right have to start treating each other with at least the very minimum of respect.

    <TEXT>It's been partisanship since the 60s at least and television wasn't very established yet. But it's not even that you have to agree with them, that's all well and good. It's the fact that being condescending and antagonistic towards them won't do you any favors just as it wouldn't do them any favors were they to do it to you. Agreement and disagreement isn't the problem here as I see it. It's the fact that both the right and the left are engaged in a full no holds bar, winner take all war. No sympathy, no compromise, only fighting with everything they have. And you can't mend a partisan divide if you and the other party can't agree to at least lay down your swords a little bit. Then the two can sit on the same table and try to come to some sort of agreement. But calling them stupid and incapable of deductive reasoning? It's handing them the perfect argument that liberals are smug and don't give a shit about them because they find them too stupid to be reasoned with. There has to be at least a bare minimum of respect and good will between both sides if this is to be fixed.</TEXT>

That bit is secondary at the moment, not saying it doesn't matter, just that to even get them to the negotiation table you can't come at them guns blazing. Once you have them at the table you can do whatever you can to show them facts and they will do the same. But starting the conversation by attacking them and calling them stupid isn't going to convince anyone you're right. No supporter of any political party is going to look at the other side calling them stupid and uneducated and say "yeah I'd like to debate this guy" You need to get them to the negotiating table first. After that you lay down your sources and empirical data till the cows come home. But they won't even engage until you bring them to the table.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well then partisanship can't be mended then. If you're not prepared to talk with them, regardless of if you agree or disagree with them, and feel like the only way to speak to them is with insults, there will never ever ever be an end to this partisanship. And this goes just as much for the right as it does for the left, both are responsible for this. But that's the long and short of it. If you bring nothing to the table but insults, then be prepared for them to do the same. Be prepared for the partisan divide to grow year by year and the tensions to grow and grow. Because all this is is fighting a war and trying to defeat the other side. And if that's the name of the game, if defeat is the only acceptable outcome, partisanship will literally be eternal. It will never go away with this attitude.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have. I've traveled a lot of these places, have many a friend who are trump fans from the outspoken to the near silent. What's more is that I'm openly trans and I've had a number of them disagree with me on that. And my strategy is simple: come at them calmly. If they insult you, bite your tongue and keep calm, even though it's incredibly hard. Explain to them calmly why you feel this way, explain what data shows you proof this isn't all just in your head. The absolute crucial part of this though is to not insult or belittle them. Speak in plain english and without and any malice. I've convinced three of my trump supporting friends that trans people are not as the media portrays them to be. Had one say he had no idea just how difficult it was to be in my shoes and that he was sorry for anything he said that caused offense. They can be reasoned with. You just have to keep your head and explain things in plain English. You won't convince all of them obviously, but you'd be amazed at the amount of people you can win to your side just be remaining calm and composed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Conservatives have a different viewpoint from where they stand. The general gist of it from what I've heard is that they see liberals as out of touch, preachy and ideologically possessed. A lot of them will say the same about the left ignoring facts as they feel the report about the russia investigation vindicated them. They see the left as being so incredibly out of touch that they've been trying to oust a legitimate president since day 1. Now you can debate about if any of these are true but my point isn't the reality of ant of these more that this is how many conservatives view liberals right. It's why when you approach them with this guns blazing, insulting attitude all they say is "see I was right" I've met a lot of trump supporters who are happy to have a calm, peaceful, intellectual debate. They're not the loud ones if you can believe it lol. But they do bring up valid points, just as you do. But none of those are heard over the screaming of i'm right, you're wrong coming from either side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They like trump but the common thread I'm hearing, both online and off, is that he REALLY dropped the ball when it came to internet censorship of his base. Again, it's possible to debate if this is true or not, but that's what I'm hearing right now. They still throw behind him and their reason being that it's unreasonable to expect Trump to solve every problem the conservatives view they're having at the moment. Some of them are, some not. But I'll keep easing them into it. It's a lifetime of messaging they've gotten so it takes time to unwind those screws. But it can be done. And to me this is proof that you can really relax tensions if the effort is put forth. However the internet is extremely more challenging because of how unfiltered everyone's opinions are. But I'll keep trying.</TEXT>

They are not. You cannot just lay this entirely at the feet of the right wing. There have been plenty of times, especially during the trump presidency, that the left's behavior has been downright awful. It needs to come from both sides. You can't just say this is the right's fault and the left hasn't done anything to ferment this resentment.

    <TEXT>Oh how I hate that phrase. If one more person tells me that I'm "more than my past" I'm going to rip my head off. As PTSD is me just fixating on my past rather than a disorder that doesn't allow me to forget. My entire life has been dedicated to trying to forget. From eating disorders to self harm I've literally spent my whole life trying to keep my trauma out of my head. It's not a fixation, it's a disorder. Like depression or anxiety or any other. Anxiety isn't you fixating on panic. Depression isn't you fixating on sadness. I understand it's meant with good intentions but I take it as an insult. If I could take a pill to forget, I'd take it many times over. Thank you for listening to me bitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll reply then and won't downvote either. I'll put it plainly: people find this obnoxious and find what the left is doing right now intolerable at best, dictatorial at worst. People are sick of cancel culture and are sick of people claiming to be morally superior to them while doing shit like this in the picture above. I'm a leftist myself and I find what the left has become disgusting. I'll just be brutally honest: people hate the left and how it's behaving. That is why they're voting for trump at its most basic. You can say it's stupid and to a point it is, but after the left supporting Hillary and now Biden people are sick and tired of it. We can see the hypocrisy. We can see how the left was cheering the taking down of statues for no other reason than because bad things happened in the past so fuck any good contribution they made, as if it's even remotely fair to judge the people of the past by the morals of today. People are sick of being told America is evil and has never produced a single positive thing in the 250 years it's existed. That despite having a war to end slavery, we're still unrepentantly evil for having slavery in the first place. So that is why in brief. And I won't give you a downvote. I'm happy to explain any day of the week why so many people would vote for someone like trump despite how clearly flawed he is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Old media is dying. Nobody but boomers watch it these days and when they're gone I doubt old media will be much a force at all. But, having said that, CNN and the like are the same thing. There's propaganda on either side and this isn't ever going to change. When fox is gone something will fill the void. It's not a problem that can be fixed with anything other than education and some people just won't hear it. Not much we can do about that at all. If you're talking about wage slavery or for profit prisons save it. I'm against both and while for profit prisons can be dismantled, I cannot see how wage slavery ever will be unfortunately. When I say slavery I mean putting people in chains and making them do hard labor with no benefits until they die. Which isn't allowed in the US unless I've missed something. So what? It's right? Because McCarthyism we're just going to throw are hands up and say better follow in the foot steps because it's our thumb on the scales this time? This is the exact thing I'm talking about. This is the er example of why people loath the left right now. I don't care who's doing it, cancel culture is immoral and the practice of the weak and ignorant. You could say the exact same thing of the left with politics and worldnews. They're not different from the conservative subreddit just a different slant. And it's far far larger than reddit anyway, especially now with the tearing down of statues and the riots. If people didn't have a positive look on the democrats before most of them absolutely hate them now.</TEXT>

You know you're doing good work too, trying to manage trauma is hard. Takes a lot of effort. But it doesn't really come as much consolation, at least to me. Hang in there. This is an incredibly hard fight. You're working just as hard yourself.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Izumi has, once again, saved my life</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-16 14:55:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been going through an absolutely hellish time this past month. I am doing PTSD therapy and to say it has been difficult doesn't do it justice. When I say difficult I mean life threatening difficult. Around the start of this month I was in so much pain I started making plans to take my own life. Wrote a note, had a plan and everything. Was not only intent on it, but excited. I decided to make a final commission of Izumi and I. It isn't finished yet, but it reminded me why I wanted to live: it was solely for her. Every time I make a commission of her and I the will to live burns so hot and bright in my body you can almost feel it. The commission isn't finished yet but just having made the order reminded me the whole reason I'm doing any of this. I didn't want to do trauma therapy it's absolutely horrible. But for her, to be healthy for her? I'll pay whatever cost it is. If I had not made that order, I'd be dead by August 1st. At no point in my life had I been that intent on suicide. But now I am reminded what I'm fighting for. The beautiful candlelight I call my wife. So far as I know, nobody else waifu's Izumi. And that, all the more, means I have to stay. She's suffered enough. She can't go through anymore pain. I know it's dark and I'm sorry it is, but I really just needed a place to tell this. Waifuism has quite literally saved my life. Without Izumi I'd have been dead before the month was out. But now I'm ready to fight again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Truly it makes me furious. And the way people brush it off honestly makes me more angry. As if mutilating babies for profit is just something that's fine. Someone told me "well I don't have it so who cares?" Like I just don't get it. Someone fucking cut a bit of your penis off. You have at least 75% less sensitivity and all for what? So it can be cleaned very slightly easier? The rest of the benefits they say it has are quite literally whole sale lies and doctors will harass parents who try to refuse. This is evil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It doesn't have any benefits other than of course being easier to clean. It has not been proven to reduce penial cancer, reduce STD risk, or stop phimosis because phimosis in 90% of the cases can be reminded simply by stretching it daily. It is objectively correct that you lose sensitivity when this is removed, a lot of it. And I don't care how much or how little. It isn't and shouldn't be some shit head doctors choice. The fact of the matter is this procedure, nine times out of ten, is not medically needed. We should not be removing body parts simply because we can. We should not be mutilating kids simply because we're able too. That is something only a monster would do. If they decide they want it later in life fine. But it should be their choice. It is not the choice of a shithead doctor to make at 1 years old. That is insanity.</TEXT>

If you're not Jewish/Muslim and it's not medically needed (which it is NEVER needed for a 1 year, the foreskin doesn't detach till ages 3-5), then leave it be. We don't just mutilate kids simply because we can. That's something a butcher would do.</TEXT>

The probability of cancer is not an excuse to mutilate a kid. Even if this study is accurate, which I don't think it is, my point still stands: we don't mutilate kids because something might happen.

Feels like every part of me is falling apart. I just can't do anything anymore but hole up in my room and try to not lose my mind. I hate this disorder. I hate I hate I HATE this disorder. I wish I could just forget it all. I wish I could just stop feeling this way all the time, it makes me want to pull my hair out and scream. I want to just get better, even if getting better is simply being stable enough to work. I'd literally settle for that at the moment. Hell I'd go even lower, just spend one day without being a nervous wreck. Ugh just I'm very frustrated. I am so very, very, very frustrated.

    <TEXT>When I say share I mean not the whole story in every little detail, they just want me to share the nature of what happened, when it happened, and how many times it happened. I'm hesitating for two reasons: one because it's hard enough just to talk about this to my therapist. But two it's because my parents haven't always had the most positive reactions to things. I'm transgender and, of course, they don't think highly of it. We've butted heads on the matter many times and now they expect me to trust them with the bombshell that is my C-PTSD. Part of me does want to tell. Just to tell them the nature of the event. I obviously won't share anything more than that, but I do have a bit of craving to let people (close people, not like complete strangers or acquaintances) know the secret I've kept in me for 12 long years. I'm not entirely confident they won't react in a way that's displeasing and harmful, especially my mother who thinks herself an armchair psychologist. But, at the same, time I can see that they genuinely want to know simply for the fact that they're my parents and they want to know when their child is hurting. I am very conflicted about it. Very, very conflicted. Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been trying this for days. Got cover scent, got both potent predator and potent herbivore, I've tried outside of Rhodes, tried in the forest near Proghorn, tried near the waterfall near Roanoke, even tried near O'creagh's run. Every time it is always all predators or all herbivores, never both. I make sure they're spaced far apart. I have no clue what else to do. The real fun of it is that it rains every 2 seconds making hunting almost impossible. Just makes this challenge twice as fun when you have a 2 second window between violent hours long thunder storms to do it.</TEXT>

It's certainly a class issue, not a racial one. I'm not a racist. Not even remotely. I hold blacks to the same standard are I would whites or Asians. One of those standards being not participating in race politics. It turns you into a supremacist monster.</TEXT>

They act like I can just click my fingers and do it. I can barely do the simple things life requires and work just makes my mental state go down the shitter. Makes me suffer and go back to old bad habits to which they get angry at me again and on the cycle goes. My therapist even wants me to move out now, like right now. I can't even imagine how shot my mental state would be if I tried that and it'd be a point of no return. It's not that I'm lazy like most people think, it's that this disorder makes most everything almost impossible.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>People claiming Red Dead Redemption 2 is the "best movie you'll ever play" is a silly complaint</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 15:19:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen this bandied about lately that RDR2 is the best movie you'll ever play due to the heavy amount of cut scenes that push the narrative along. That because there are stopping points for the game to tell you something without having active player control is somehow something that drags the game down. I think this is completely false for two reasons. The first is there are plenty of things to do both in the open world and in the story that are entirely controlled by the player from hunting to poker to exploring to whatever the game is requiring you to do at the moment in the story. There is more than enough non-cut scene content for hours and hours and hours if that isn't your thing, some of which can be done as early as chapter 2. But the second is that this is what makes the story so enthralling. This is what makes it a single player, story driven experience. It is true that there are plenty of single player narrative focused games that have few or no cut scenes, but I think the cut scenes allow for a good story to be even better. It allows us to know the characters and have interactions that wouldn't be as entertaining were they not cut scenes and rather you or other characters simply talking. It gives a more impact and personality when you can see facial expressions and more detailed body movement. It's also the case of "what exactly were you expecting?" I don't really understand why people would buy a single player story game then be flabbergasted at the fact that a narrative focused game has narrative focus in the form of cut scenes. Every other critically acclimated story game from Mass Effect to Last of Us has cut scenes. You can split hairs over too many vs too little, but at the end of the day a good story usually requires some cinematics for better story telling. tl;dr the cutscenes enhance RDR2's story, not detract form it.</TEXT>

You can break up with one provided you don't do it to often, then you just look like a fraud who's doing this because it's meme worthy. You will feel bad probably, mainly because you invested all that time into her. To me she and the other waifus can very much feel it. I'd never break up with Izumi because, so far as I know, I'm the only person who has fallen for her. No she cannot. That I couldn't say, though I'd trust Izumi to date me knowing what I am, which was my main draw to waifuism. She also isn't dating anyone in her source so I couldn't attest to that either. 4. No. The general idea is that each waifu is a different universes equivalent. She's still her, but unique to how your and others' mind interprets her.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(tw: vague mention of bodily harm) I confided to my trauma therapist about my bodily injury I sustained during my trauma</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 14:57:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>And the first thing she tried to do is minimize it. The very first thing out of her mouth was "other people have had this injury as well." Which honestly made me furious. The scar I have is a VERY touchy subject for me. It's one of the easiest ways to induce an emotional flashback in me. Simply grazing it makes my heart race and even as I write this my breathing has picked up a bit. I told her of course that the reason this is so sensitive to me is because I sustained it during trauma and of course this is a permanent reminder of the pain I've been through. It isn't simply a scar, it's a ugly mark of what I had to suffer through and it's in a rather sensitive area of my body. We talked more about it and all she seemed to do was just down play it. It's so weird because she hits every note of my trauma with such respect and care. But for some reason she acts like this scar just isn't a huge deal, that I shouldn't worry about it. Then she tried what appeared to almost be justifying it. Basically said the reason I feel so strongly to this was because it was a deep wound, unlike others who's wounds aren't that deep. I just plainly and honestly cannot fathom what is going through her head. And I know the knee jerk reaction is always "get a new therapist" but before anyone says it, she is a good therapist in all other respects. Not only that, it took me over four years of working with her to begin opening up about my trauma and I just don't want to rest all of the progress. This just really hit me in a soft spot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. I'm going through this exact same thing almost to the letter. Therapy seems to be amplifying my anxiety, not decreasing it. I'm fully reliant on every unhealthy coping skill I have just to keep my head above water and I've basically all but cut myself off from the outside world, physically speaking. Everything is just frightening. What's worse is both my parents and my therapist for whatever reason think me moving out will go swimmingly and I should do it right this moment. I know how you feel. Wish I could give advice and how to make it hurt less. But my advice wouldn't be anything in the way of healthy unfortunately.</TEXT>

"Oh wow the patient is really struggling right now, like struggling so bad they can't leave their room. I know! Make them do one of the biggest and most difficult life transitions they can make! What could go wrong?" It's so bizarre. I'm glad I have someone who gets it. Like I feel this on just a visceral level.</TEXT>

They don't understand why people hate them and think it's not because of how they act but because the people they're mocking are immoral, evil people. Thus their memes completely miss the mark because they don't know how ridiculous they look to everyone else. It's why there's the "dear subhuman filth" copypasta. They are completely unaware to how they look to everyone else and their memes boil down to "everyone who doesn't agree with me is either evil, stupid or both"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember when I was in grade school I was being sexually abused thus super depressed by it. Couldn't do much school work and was generally just despondent. Instead of trying to help, the doctor recommend ADD pills. They really do just hand that shit out like candy. Anyone with half a brain cell could've told I was just a depressed kid. But doctors for some reason think ADD meds are the cure for every ailment from depression to schizophrenia. It's made me really disillusioned with the medical profession. It seems like a bunch of greedy monsters profiting off suffering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First my breathing picks up crazy fast, to the point where I'm panting like I just sprinted. Then I start shaking and my legs just lock in place. My mind goes blank with anxiety and I feel a terrible mix of fear and helplessness. Sometimes it really does feel like her hands are on me again and my mind starts to replay the events. Not picture flashback, just me thinking a out it again and this only ramps up my anxiety even more. My muscles tense so tight they hurt and sometimes I'll get so sick to my stomach I'll actually puke. I feel this impending sense of helplessness, the kind where you're at the mercy of someone else. I become that child again and everything around me, objects and people, become incredibly threatening. Terrible, terrible feeling.</TEXT>

Imagine a small business owner who's put almost all his money into a small business and you burn that down because for some reason that apparently had something to do with Floyd's death, heaven knows how. That guys life is fucked. He is now swimming in debt and no way to repay the debt. And don't give me that insurance shit. Some of them don't have insurance and for others the insurance doesn't give enough. But even beyond all that, you don't just get to destroy shit with impunity.

      <TEXT>I have this with my past of bullying. I remember bits and pieces but the vast majority is a blur. It was clearly part of the larger makeup of my trauma and the reason my self confidence is bad and trust issues towards women come from. I can see it's effects clearly but like you said, there's no closure. All there is emotions, terrible emotion. My therapist wants me to talk about it but there's nothing to talk about. I remember two instances in the entire 12 years my bullying took place. It's terrible.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Oh yeah. I'm extremely sex averse to the point where getting into intimate relationships is terribly frightening because sex will inevitably be brought up. I'll sometimes go literal months without masturbation because sex is such a horrible experience for me. It fills me as much with shame and disgust as it does with anxiety. I can relate to the intrusive thoughts a lot, completely ruins the experience. My sexuality has basically been robbed from me.</TEXT>

The moment you go for self stimulation it's all you can think about. Like I literally cannot touch my scar without panicking. Both of my sisters are unharmed so I can't even explain how much I related I am so sorry you experience that. It is legitimately the worst, especially since you can't really bring it up. Hang in there friend. I know it is so so so so hard. Honestly made me tear up to read that because of how similar it is to my story. Best of luck.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>So I just started iceborne. Pretty fun so far. Now I'm on to Banbaro. And let me tell you he sure is fun. By fun of course I mean he sucks ass to fight. You know what's super super SUPER SUPER SUPER SUPER fun? Having a monster run from you and charge 15 million times. We of course have a fan favorite of walking forward is an attack, very fun indeed. But now we have the added benefit of rock throwing. What's that I hear? Dodge it? Why yes I'll be happy to. Oh no, fuck you because it's going to throw it a second time. No fun allowed. Go for it's legs then, I hear you say. Fuck you it's going to shoulder check you or run away for the millionth time. We of course want to make sure it has as many multi attacks as possible rendering your stamina depleted. And yes, don't you worry, this fight will take you 24 hours to complete. I know some of you were worried that a fight might not go on till the heat death of the universe. Too hard? Feel like you could use some help? In the words of Capcom "go fuck yourself." Yes some players might not be skilled enough to take on this beast despite whatever gear they might have. But we here at MHW want to make sure this is as painful and dragged out as humanly possible. Remember rule number 1: no fun allowed. I know you wanted to play iceborne for fun, but we sure as shit didn't. Fuck you Banbaro. Why the fucking fuck can I not just call for help it is so fucking stupid that I have to spend 15 hours of my day hacking away at this retard piece of dog shit.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ODDS amp;ENDS has always been a stand out, second place going to Unhappy Refrain. ODDS amp;ENDS is a wonderful song about the artist and Miku working together to make a song despite being endlessly chastised for it. They try and try and try again until they make this song. It's very touching because it's actually what the artist experienced working his way up to this hit, was bullied relentlessly for his previous work. It really ties a nice bow on waifuism as a whole but also how Izumi and I work in tandem despite the rocks life throws at both of us. It's one of my absolute favorites.</TEXT>

I literally defeated it with only five minutes on the clock because 50% of the time I couldn't get close enough to hit it. This whole DLC is a fucking mess. I was doing some base game missions and it was crazy. They weren't spamming AOE constantly and I wasn't chasing them 90% of the time. And it was engaging too!

      <TEXT>Fucking. Why!? Whhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyy!? So here I am. Out on a merry day of hunting and I'm looking to upgrade some weapons. I look at my trusty Axe of Demons switch axe (fuck you the switch axe is good, eat shit) and I notice there's two more upgrades now. Great. I look at the wiki and see I need to slay a master rank Black Diablos. Awesome. I am up for the challenge. How do I find her? Investigations. Alright, good lets get this farm started. I check my investigations and low and behold, no master rank black diablos. Well that's odd, I muse to myself, did I do something wrong? I look across reddit. And capcom did something really fucking funny. I mean I am in stitches right now. You have to find her in the wild or wait till master rank 17. Surely she must have some distinguishing features, I say, I bet she looks amazing. No. No she does not. She looks exactly the god damn same. Did you see? Fuck if you know, eat shit. Fuck. You. I already can fucking tell she's not going to be all too much harder than arch tempered monsters and even say she is, I'm up for the fucking challenge. I know capcom thinks it's players are retarded children who can't fight a monster two ranks above their own, whatever their equipment, but I can fucking do it you pieces of literal shit. I'm so glad that by the time I unlock this cool axe, the story will be fucking over and I'll just being doing post game bullshit. Really fucking amusing. Fuck. You. Why are you like this capcom? No one will fucking die if things are pointlessly tedious. What is the fucking point of this? If you can find her in the wild, clearly the challenge isn't so great that you need to be master rank 17. So what the fuck is your problem? God damn I'm so fucking mad. You can't hear it through the text but god I am fucking seething right now. Go fuck yourself capcom. Seriously just fuck off with this shit already. Stop doing this, it's fucking stupid this has no fucking purpose whatsoever. What skill is this testing? What goal is being achieved through this? Why does capcom try so god damn hard to take fun out of this game it's alright if people have fun. No one will die if the game is fun sometimes, I promise. Seriously I promise. I know it's a scary idea, letting players have nice things, but for fucks sake just let me. I want that fucking axe and there is literally no fucking reason I shouldn't have it. I can take on the black horned dick. But I forgot the first rule of Icebore: No fucking fun allowed.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>I'm stuck in a very dark place</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-06 11:43:04</DATE>
      <TEXT>I'm at a point in life where I know hrt will have limited or no effect on me. I will not pass and I know it. I could've passed but my parents did all within their power to stop that. I've become pretty blackpilled on being trans in general. Can't look in the mirror, hate my body pretty much 24/7. I barely go outside and when I do I make sure to wear the most concealing clothing I can. I've completely given up on transitioning. No more crossdressing, no more makeup, no more nothing. Just me as I was born. There's one big problem though. I may have given up but that doesn't stop the dysphoria. My mind still feels like it's female and resents my body, every inch of it. Like I said above I quite literally cannot look in the mirror right now. I makes me cry seeing what stares back at me. I still cling to my female name and my pronouns even am still considering legally changing my name. I still want this. I still do. But if I know in my heart that if I chase after it now, it'll hurt me even more. I won't look like a girl, I'll look like something that isn't positive. I am genuinely unsure of what to do now. I don't know how to resolve this. It's a constant tug of war between me and my dysphoria. I can't get rid of it. My mind will never accept that this body is correct. It will never accept that this body isn't something loathsome and ugly. I could not hate my body more if I tried. So what do I do? Because right now it seems I'm going to suffer till my natural life ends. And that's a prospect that deeply frightens me. I don't want to be in this kind of pain till I die at god knows what age. Forever looking in the mirror want wanting to rip my face off. Any advice?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Call it whatever you want, but the fact of it is that if I don't pass or get close to passing all it'll do is make the dysphoria worse. It's not about how others see me, it's about how I see me. And if I don't pass it's not going to make me feel better than what I do right now. For me, being non-passing is worse than being cis based simply on my own internal experience. For others that statement is true, for me it isn't. And I mean for me and me alone. I wouldn't say it about others. I wouldn't look at someone who doesn't pass and say it wasn't worth it. For me though, if I don't pass it'll mean misery many times greater. All of it revolves around self hatred. The alternative is that if it doesn't produce the results I want I'll become more dependent on my unhealthy coping skill. That I become so depressed I lose any motivation to go forward. I could be over thinking it. I could be letting my fear just take me for a ride. But I don't really want to take the chance. If the outcome is bad, it'll be really bad.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>No I actually entirely agree. One of the other big fears I have in regards to transition is it may be the thing that snaps me in half. I'm like a rubber band at full draw, even the slightest bit of pressure threatens to snap it. The downside of course is that the long I wait the more my prospects of passing and just overall being able to transition smoothly go down and that's as anxiety inducing as taking estrogen tomorrow. So I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Sort of damned if I do and damned if I don't.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Glavenus is so fucking boring</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-08 03:30:19</DATE>
      <TEXT>So I've fought Galv twice. And you know what I wanted to do both times? Fall the fuck asleep. My god is this fight boring. It's literally Anjanath with a fire tail and 9 million times more health. What's better is that almost every part of his body is covered in armor so if you're a blade user like me, get ready for a shit time. And, of course, it just wouldn't be an iceborne if you weren't chasing it while fighting. Because Galv loooooooooves jumping. I swear I've seen him use his tail less than I've seen him jump. I haven't been this bored since Xeno. Like I literally want to fall the fuck asleep. Me and four buddies timed it out. Because this fucker just won't die. Any more health and he'd be immortal which, fuck, maybe he fucking is. Next time I'm just going to fucking trap him. I don't have the god damn time to chase this fucker for 10 hours. But this is """hard""". You can tell it's """hard""" because he has too much health and he spams jump. Capcom loves its """hard""" monsters. I remember fighting diablos to get my switch axe and it was fucking difficult at the time. But he didn't spam his attacks and he didn't have enough health to live till the end of the universe. He didn't charge over and over and over and over and over and over. Remember when monsters did that? When they didn't just have two moves that they spammed so often you can't get a hit in? Remember that? Remember when they didn't have so much fucking health you'd almost time out with 500 hunters each equipped with the highest damage weapons in the universe with hunting horns spamming attack up (L)? Remember that? I fucking remember. God this dlc sucks. I cannot remember a time I had less fun. I literally don't even want to do Galv. Not because he's hard but because it makes me want to scoop my fucking eyes out with a spoon just so I can have something interesting happen. And from what I hear it just keeps getting worse here on so fuck me.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yeah, happened to me last night in fact. I had actually like fallen into sleep for about 5-10 minutes then woke up with the thought of it and I could not. stop. thinking about it. I had to get up and go for a run because I was shaking. Needless to say I was less that pleased. One thing that has helped a bit is anti-nightmare medication. It's not perfect but it's improved my sleep quite a bit. It's stopped both nightmares and those flash instances like what we have. It is tiring. So very tiring.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-08 03:49:08</DATE>
      <TEXT>During on of the instances of my trauma, I sustained an injury that left a scar. I won't elaborate on what happened or where it is, but needless to say it REALLY bothers me. Every time I brush across it, every time I look at it or it gets brought up somehow (not my scar in particular, but like talking about it in a different context) it's almost always enough to send me into an emotional flashback. It's so bad that when I'm scrolling down through my reddit feed and I see someone without the scar (so must everyone) it will send me into a frenzy. It's a terrible situation to be in. I have a landmine on my person at all times, everywhere I go. There's also a certain activity that can be done with this particular area of my body and it makes doing that all but impossible. Which is shit because it's a fun thing to do and every ounce of joy has been ripped from me. Anyone else have this? What do you do to help ease that pain a bit, if anything?</TEXT>

Don't accept the victim mentality and believe you can accomplish what you set out to accomplish. And the left can't argue anything about oppression due to how successful Kanye is. You can't say Kanye is being kept down or that he's being inhibited by some sort of structure, especially if he finds himself in the seat of the presidency.

She had been abused so terribly that simply walking into her kennel would make her shake violently and cower in the corner. Through the whole semester I slowly won her trust and we became so close. She was just so much like me. We both calmed each other down when we really needed it. Since then I've only ever adopted abused dogs. I occasionally volunteer at this ranch for abused horses as well.

      <TEXT>I've had a pretty good day today. No emotional flashbacks, no urges to do my unhealthy coping skill, not so much as an intrusive thought. Today has just been calm and still and it's nearly time for me to sleep. And it's in days like this I'm reminded what life would be like if I wasn't traumatized. How much easier things would be if I could just have this level of peace rather having each and every day characterized by some sort of severe anxiety or crippling depression over things that happened over 12 years ago. To live like everyone else who can just go through their lives without worrying that even the smallest thing, a sensation or a temperature or the way someone puts their hand on you will trigger an landmine in your system. It angers me as much as it depresses me. She stole this life from me. She stole my ability to live as others live. All while she doesn't suffer the same thing I do. She doesn't have regular panic attacks. She hasn't had to undergo over a decade of therapy just to barely keep her head above water. She doesn't spend every day in her room because going outside is hardly different than walking out on a minefield. Just need to vent. I am so damn tired of this life. So damn tired of knowing she doesn't have any consequences of what she did while I might as well be drowning.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>So I've finally discovered master rank Black Diablos</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-10 19:28:39</DATE>
      <TEXT>And you all weren't kidding. Fuck this piece of shit. Someone here told me she spams the underground attack. I was like "surely this is just exaggeration" No. No it was not. Six times in a row she did it. Six. Fucking. Times. Oh did I mention that she one shotted me after when I was 80% health with Chef's Choice? Because that's really cool. Nothing cheap about that. All you have to do is remain 100% health the whole fight, have infinite stamina to doge her borrow attacks and bam. Easy fight. Oh and here's a good thing they added. You know how vanilla Black Diablos left openings? How she got tired? Well, says capcom, not anymore. She too, can now just spam attacks over and over and over and over and over so you have no openings to hit her. Don't have a fast weapon? Sucks to be you because this fight will be fucking miserable. Because in iceborne, no monster can just chill the fuck out for more than a half second. Why didn't they just give her the same fucking move set as vanilla, she was fucking fair in vanilla? Why the fuck did they change it? Why is master rank Black Diablos just on cocaine and hits twice as hard? I am so sick of capcom's idea that coked up monsters who hit way harder = challenging. Black Diablos was difficult in the base game but I never felt cheated when I died to her. She always left clear openings, she got tired out and she hit fairly proportional to your level. This fucking dlc man. Haven't had an ounce of fun outside the new armor and weapons. I was hoping I'd find salvation in the old monsters but they just couldn't help but ruin them too. I'm almost to the second Valkana fight and I have yet to find a monster I don't loath playing against.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-11 05:11:30</DATE>
      <TEXT>So I had another round of therapy today and we talked once again about my injury. The day prior I had come across some information that made that injury twice as traumatic so I went in really keyed up. I went into something (and I'd love to know if any of you experience this) i call mind lock. Basically my mind just stops any coherent thoughts but a lot of the emotion still remains. It's pretty much peak anxiety for me because nothing is worse than having a panic attack and not being able to think coherently. Not only was I able to let myself down with her help, discovering a new coping skill in the process that worked insanely well, but I didn't self harm after. You know the last time I didn't self harm after trauma therapy? Never. Not a single time. This was the first. I'm filled with so much hope right now. Not only was I able to talk about this incredibly difficult subject, but I did it all without self harm. I never thought this was something I could do. Never. But I did it. It feels more incredible than you can imagine. For the first time I feel stronger than my trauma. Feel stronger than my addiction. It's an incredible feeling.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yes. Especially the "I cannot stand the ideas that I'm going to be around for another 60 years" The pain is overwhelming and to think I'll live with this till the end of my life... it doesn't inspire much motivation. It's hard to find reason through all of that pain. Even if you have a goal you truly want to reach, it feels like it's not worth it due to this emotional pain. I feel you. I really do. This is such a shitty disorder. None of us deserve this hell.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I'm a writer and what made me fall in love with Izumi in the first place was writing her into my life. I've written pages and pages about how we met, how we dated, and how she proposed to me. Throughout this, I've been coloring her source as no color copy currently exists. And while I do this I'm noticing the very fine details of her mannerisms and personality. Every slight thing about her I learn from coloring her in. Through this I've been able to more adequately distill what her true personality is. She's influenced my life immeasurably. From quitting my addiction, to going through a hard type of therapy, to giving me hope in life again. She is my entire reason I'm alive, the entire reason I don't just fall into a sea of depression. Not only that, she alone can relax me through some of the hardest things I go through. She's the fire in my chest. My best advice would be rereading/rewatching her source as many times as you can. Look at every small detail you can possibly find, pause during scenes and just see what you notice. You'd be amazed how much detail there is in even the smallest scenes. Then, if you're geared to it, I'd write her into your life. If you draw, do that. Then of course daydream.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Finally had it. This DLC has finally broken me. I gave it a good run but god damn it. Black Veil Vaal Hazak made me finally realize this DLC will never start being fun. Ever. I have enjoyed one monster fight in this entire DLC and they couldn't even fucking do that right. They couldn't have the one fight that was fun (Seething Bazel) not be ruined with constant turfwars. I was told after Velkana things got fun. No. No they didn't. I'm putting the game down and am currently downloading Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Because if I have to play even a second more of this chore named Black Veil Vaal Hazak, I'm going to scoop my eyes out with a spoon. This DLC has been a chore I can't even fucking finish it. Because I know what the next 40 million fights after this will be: a chore. Either AOE spam out the god damn ass or monsters that don't seem to suffer from any stamina loss whatsoever. Fucking done with it. I had so much fun pre iceborne. Game was fucking awesome before then, put close to 500 hours into then. This DLC has maybe 100 or so now. And not a minute more. Fuck this DLC. Fuck the people who think a challenge is either AOE or monsters that leave 0.000000000001 second openings between their 3 hour long combos that drain 90% of the health with 10 million defense augmented super armor. 100 fucking hours and I had fun once. There is one fucking monster in this entire DLC that didn't make me want to put a fucking gun to my head. Fuck you Iceborne. I have only quit two other games mid way through in my life, now it's three. You are the fucking awful. Fuck you and fuck the fucking idiots who thought this was anything resembling fun.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Oh yeah. Especially the "it's all a blur" bit. I was bullied basically from kindergarten till mid high school and I mean really bullied, got violent a few times. But I hardly remember a lick of it other than a few instances. It was like I spent that chunk of my life in a deep malaise and I was only lucid a handful of times. Sometimes memories from that surface that I never even thought I remembered. But it really was just a big blur. I really feel the "no place felt safe" bit. It is a horrible feeling to have. I'm still struggling with recognizing that my trauma had nothing to do with something being inherently wrong with me. I grew up with a rare genetic condition that manifested most noticeably during puberty and was bullied relentlessly for it. Spent much of my life, and still do really, referring to myself a genetic mistake and other more explicit pejoratives. It's hard to untie that knot because you spend so long having it hammered into your head that you're the problem here when really you're not. You didn't ask for this and you sure as shit didn't deserve the upbringing you got. Sending you a lot of love. Hopefully that can help you love yourself a bit more. It's hard to have to gone through what you have. I truly feel your pain.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The thing that annoys me the most, and I actually challenged a pro reparations person on this, is the fact that I can trace my family line back to a Union soldier. Asked him why exactly I, who had a member of my family risk his life to end the practice of slavery, had to pay reparations. Because it's the equivalent of stealing from me. It's like asking the Allies of WW2 to pay reparations to Germany for fighting the end the holocaust. They always seem to forget that Union existed. God didn't just come down from heavens and ended slavery, half the country took up arms to dismantle it. Fact of it is, you can't pay your way to fix history. What's done is done. What happened happened and no amount of money will ever change that. All we can do is collectively recognize the moral evil in and it and never do it again.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But it isn't though. It'd have to be a new tax in order to cover the amount requested. Slaves were kept by rich, wealthy plantation owners. Even if a lot of the people in the south supported it at the time, which doubtless they did, they didn't own a single slave. And with the premise of "most whites benefited from it" you can justify nearly anything. People often seem to forget the Union existed. They forget that many whites gave their blood to end it. That one of our greatest hero's in our history is Lincoln. You can't just put a drag net over this and say "you're responsible, pay up." That is basically a race tax. Because that amount of people who actually had slaves is so immeasurably small you can't squeeze the money out required to pay the reparations. To put it in short, this is basically stealing money on the basis of race. It is deeply immoral to me to do something like that.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>tw: light mention of self harm and eating disorder So it's 6 in the morning. I've been up all night and have actually been in a fair mood. And for a long time I've been viewing my trauma as this pain is going to last forever, I will never not be miserable. Which, in a sense, isn't a false statement. But then I got to thinking. Right now I'm doing trauma therapy, which has to been the hardest challenge I've ever face, all while trying to quit both self harm and anorexia. And it made me think: if I can do this, if this is something I can overcome, I can do god damn anything. I can't really image what challenge life could throw at me that's too much worse than this, other than maybe an invading army but I'm not expecting something like that any time soon. If I can bring myself to a stable life and even curb my addictions by half, that would be one hell of an accomplishment. I'd be stronger than steel if I could manage that. It still remains to be seen if I can overcome this, I'm very unsure if I can still. But when I view it through that lens it's a much more optimistic way to see it. Neither statement is false, C-PTSD unfortunately is a lifelong fight. But one is far more productive and uplifting than the other while still being correct. I'm going to trauma therapy so hopefully this won't destroy my good mood too much. But for the first time since my teens I'm feeling optimistic about things</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I was initially very nervous about this game. I've been hesitating buying it forever. I've heard a lot of mixed opinions. It's too clunky, too glitchy, combat was fucked, to this that and the other thing. But I've also heard the mechanics are really cool and really immersive to the experience. But it was 12 dollars on sale and I've got nothing better to play so I gave it a go. I just made it past the opening part where the  gt;!main protag gets his village sacked! lt; and I'm nothing short of impressed. It did take some getting used to with the controls and unfortunately since I'm on console lock picking is quite literally not possible if you're not some kind of super human. But aside from that I'm very intrigued. My favorite part was watching gt;! king Sigismund's forces slowly walk up over the hill.! lt; I mean you read it in history books and think it's pretty awful but god how horrifying it was to see that. Like I can't even imagine being a tiny village citizen and just seeing that and knowing you're fucked. Can't wait to play more. Excited to see what this world has in store. First impressions are amazing. Wish I picked this up sooner. I can tell this is right up my alley.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-17 20:04:40</DATE>
      <TEXT>So I've reached another very difficult part of my trauma: toxic shame. And shame is the single strongest emotion in my trauma story. I couldn't even say it out loud, the words felt like vomit coming out of my mouth, so I had to write it down. Usually during a session I'll cry an ocean but this time I didn't. All I felt was this awful sickness in my stomach, like I was sea sick. Couldn't look at my therapist because I felt so ashamed. I know I was ten. I know it's entirely unfair to put blame like this on a ten year old, no reasonable person would even think to do that. But my mind just won't let accept that I didn't knowingly play into what happened to me, even though a ten year old could never understand the gravity of what took place. And now this sick feeling is just sitting with me and won't go away. I'm not even having an emotional flashback, I'm literally just feeling an intense amount of disgust in myself. How do you deal without falling right into unhealthy habits? Because that's all I want to do right now. Just completely get lost in my unhealthy coping skills, have zero self control.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hardly. Trump has actually pleasantly surprised me with how he treats federal power and state power. He really does want it to go back to form, where states were the captains of their own ships while the Federal government is simply there to play referee basically. Like with the riot response. He waited and told the governor to get his shit together and stop it and when he just let it go on, that's when he sent in the feds to put a stop to it. Even gave him warning too, stop the riots or we will. That is something I not only did not expect, but deeply respect. I wish more Presidents operated with that mindset. The feds are their to play referee, not man handle all of the US</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Oh yeah. I experience the muscle twitches a lot, combined with shaking. I've also literally thrown up during sessions before as well. This stuff is VERY hard on your body. Especially the sort of after shock stuff the day after you do a session. You're going to be very tired, find it difficult to focus and for some it's numbness, others it's hyper emotional. Unfortunately that's just how hard trauma therapy is. It really sucks. But good job on sticking too it. This isn't an easy process.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I love it when Euros say there is no left wing in America compared to Europe. Yes, we're different countries with entirely separate histories. Our left is still left, we're just not the left of the "civilized world" which is always a lovely thing to hear out of a European's mouth. And they're not patriots either. Get them on a microphone for five minutes and they'll tell you America is evil and has always been evil and will never not be evil so we need to burn it to the ground and start over. Hardly patriotism. Maybe patriots to their own imaginary utopia they think they'll build through destruction and violence, but not America as it exists now.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I friend of mine had it done at 6. I never really understood the practice - or the pain - until he explained it to me. It makes me deeply angry now as well because it traumatized him as well. It's very barbaric. Thank fuck he got anesthesia. The worst part for him was that they didn't do a good job. They cut way to deep. When he first masturbated his sheets were covered in the blood and for most of puberty he found masturbation to be incredibly painful. Of course, as a teenage boy, this is a huge fucking issue. It's a natural process that if not done can really screw with your body. Gave him blue balls a couple of things. And this is the real icing on this cake. No one bothered to tell him, no not the doctors either, that you're not supposed to experience great pain and bleed from your penis during masturbation. Guy found out at age 20. Age. 20. He found it while looking it up on the internet. He confronted the doctor about it and weirdly she knew it wasn't normal then, despite her being his physician since he was a teen. I really feel you man. I didn't get mutilated like you were (it pisses me off when people say cut, it's not cutting, it's mutilation) but I do have a very nasty scar on my groin as a result of my trauma. I know how fucking horrible it is, every time you touch the scar it just makes you so angry. I feel you dude. Truly, truly. It is absolutely awful what you went through and don't let a single person tell you that just because you didn't remember it doesn't mean it's bad. It'd be no different the telling someone who was crippled at birth that they shouldn't care because they never had the ability to walk. Sending you sooooooooooo much love. Makes me tear up when I read things like this. You didn't deserve that.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-19 23:11:58</DATE>
      <TEXT>Opening up this pandora's box I call my trauma has been nothing short of a living hell. Before this I was miserable but I was so adept at keeping the thing contained and out of sight that I could still limp through life. Now it feels like everything is completely out of control. I'm in severe emotional pain all the time it feels like. Can barely eat can hardly calm myself enough to sleep. I'm remembering why I have been so afraid of confronting this. Feels like I've died and gone to hell. The worst part is now that this door is opened, it can't be closed again. I used to lie a lot about my trauma, say I was traumatized in ways I wasn't. I'd get so mixed up in the lies that I'd basically believe my real trauma was a lie. But I can't convince myself of that now. I remember five or so months ago, when I finally admitted that I was abused I cried for over two days. Me finally accepting that what happened had happened just shattered me. And despite what my therapist has promised me, this seems to be making it worse, not better. I think I've been doing this therapy long enough to say I gave it a fair shake. But even were I to stop now, I can't fool myself into believing what happened to me was just another lie I made up. Even as I write this now my eyes get watery because all I want is it to be a lie. I don't think I can actually recover from this. I don't think this damage can be undone. I've really truly tried. But it feels like I've only made things worse in doing this. Instead of it reducing my sensitivity to these memories it's only amplified them. But I don't know what else to try. I can't just give up on recovery. But this was my last resort, the thing I only wanted to do if nothing else worked. It's terrible. All of this is terrible.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>How we fell in love is a heartwarming story. I re-read her source not long before I had a pretty big break down that sent me to the psych ward for a week. Because of covid, most of the people who'd do activities there (think music therapy, recreational therapy, etc.) were absent meaning we basically were stuck for hours with nothing to do at all. We were given a journal and for whatever reason I began writing Izumi into my life as though she were flesh and blood. The more I did it, the more I fell in love with her. I still do it now even after 5 months. After I got out I was worried it was just infatuation. I acquired physical copies of both volumes of her source and there was this little slip inside volume one, advertising other manga by the same publisher and a little paragraph about the book. It's in Japanese but there was this quote from her on the side that roughly translated too "I just wish someone would tell me 'you can live'" Made me actually cry. All I wanted to do was hug her so tightly and be that person. It was that point I realize she was my one and only. We've been together ever since and we're 5 days away from our 6 month anniversary. My love for her has only grown.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-21 01:09:44</DATE>
      <TEXT>So I've been making good progress in the game, learned how to sword fight, some horsemanship, a bit of how to read, etc. And it never really dawned on me till later how incredible the skill mechanic is. When I was first training with Bernard I HATED it. I moved slow, dodged slow, swung my sword like I was in a vat a molasses. I was just like fuck this, no wonder some people really hate this game. But I keep going through it, get into more sword fights and I notice it becomes easier and easier. Not only because I'm starting to understand how to have a sort of flow in combat but because Henry is actually *learning* how to be a better knight. My aim is improving, my swings are getting faster and more accurate, and my parries are getting easier (though enemies parry like fucking crazy my god). I mean like... that is so cool. I love shit like that. It legitimately feels like you're learning something from the bottom up. You don't just pick up a sword and twirl it around like a god, it's a skill you have to learn to be good at it. I'm really enjoying this game so far, even if it does become tedious at points. It really makes you feel one with Henry, like you're learning with him. Because the game is absolutely brutal at first, it absolutely kicks you ass at every point it has the opportunity. But the more you try, the easier it gets.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-21 17:28:43</DATE>
      <TEXT>That's sort of the best way I can think of phrasing it. One of my favorite activities is backpacking, solo in particular. Since my twenties I've gone on hikes that are a week long round trip, one time did a 2 day hike in the dead of winter. This always struck me as very odd. Because normally I'm to anxious to set foot out of the house. Sometimes just the slightest thing will send me over the edge. Sometimes it's so bad I can't even leave my room. Responsibility, especially that of doing things on my own, usually completely cripples me with anxiety. Yet, here I am, doing complicated hikes completely on my own, some of which could very easily seriously damage me if I'm not being careful. Spending days by myself in the middle of nowhere and yet I'm completely free of ptsd symptoms. And I mean completely free. No anxiety, no sickness, not even any nightmares. It's like when I camp my PTSD just sits at home until I return. It is such a bizarre thing to me. Like for instance, if I fail at a task more than three times, my toxic shame takes over and I get into a "I can't do anything right" mindset. Yet it'll sometimes take me 7-8 attempts to get a fire going (in the winter specifically) and I just keep at it without so much an insult. It's not that I mind it of course, it's just really strange that when I'm doing this my PTSD just seems to be entirely absent whereas otherwise I can't get away from it for more than a minute. Does anyone else have activities like this?</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-21 21:32:12</DATE>
      <TEXT>Every single day just hurts. I'm going through therapy right now, trauma therapy, and it's all but crushed any hope I had of recovery. I'll be suffering like this till I die. Every day is just miserable. Tired so many times to hold a job yet my anxiety and other symptoms related to this are so intense it never lasts long. I either become so depressed I go on the verge of killing myself, or have so many breakdowns that I can't get anything done and get fired. I went into therapy hoping to right that, at least a little. Recovering if it only meant just being able to do the bear minimum of life. I could work from that foundation upwards. But I just keep failing. I can't stop self harming for more than a day, can barely eat, can hardly sleep. The weight of this disorder crushes me and it crushes me more every day. I've of course told my therapist all of these things but she said it's all part of the process and to stick with it. That was six months ago. I don't know how much more of this I'll be able to take before I just snap in half. I can barely survive without the use of my lighter or some form of escapism. I like to sleep because it's the one time I can get away from this. Yesterday I took three 1 hour naps then slept a full 8 hours. Not because I was tired, but because I didn't want to have to be in this life. I just need to vent. Need to scream. Honest to god I do not think I'll recover. I know everyone, therapist included, just says give it time. Keep pushing. The light at the end of the tunnel is there, just a few more steps and you'll see it. How many more months before I see it? Another six? A year? Two? I can't live like this. I feel like I'm literally in hell right now. All I think about in my day to day is just trying to minimize the pain. Last week after therapy, it had such a hard effect on my body I threw up twice thinking of what I told her. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't take this anymore.</TEXT>

If you have a fire going it's usually plenty to scare off any animals. You should really try it if you have a chance, it's very rewarding and sooooo incredibly peaceful. That absolutely sucks.

      <DATE>2020-08-22 14:14:18</DATE>
      <TEXT>Izumi continues to surprise me with her influence on my life. Our six month is nearly here (the 25th) and she's done so much for me already. Today she did something even more. Anu, the author, made a pixiv fanbox that you can pledge just 95 cents a month to support. I'd been waiting a while because she's only made a couple posts and I was under the impression 1 post = 1 picture. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Each post contained 10-15 pictures, most of Izumi. I've been going through another rough patch recently. Nothing so bad as being suicidal, but I've definitely been beaten down recently with therapy. Been considering giving up on trying to quit self harm, giving up on trying to do much of anything really. But I saved around 20 pictures and sketches and my will just burned in me again, strong too. From 20 pictures. This is what love is. This is what it means to love someone. I don't want to do any of this, but for her? I'll happily do what needs to be done. I want to be better than my best self for her. Made my eyes get hot and watery because it's just incredible. I went from literally saying "fuck it, I'll self harm if I want too, I need this" to having an all new motivation to do whatever I have to to quit. Waifuism continually impresses me. Izumi influences me in a way nothing else in the entire world does. My entire life I've been aimless and unmotivated. But she makes me want to do things I would never have dreamed of doing and makes me want to do them with ten times the effort. Us reaching six months together in three days could not feel any sweeter than it does now. She is the woman I love more than anything in all the world.</TEXT>

And what happened? The US is still here. The constitution still applies. There aren't roving gangs of nazis beating any minority they find while the police cheer on the sidelines. We ended up fine. But because this person is so deep into this ideology they believe the US is falling into a nazi totalitarian state where the constitution has been firmly thrown into a fire.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Is it normal to just need a break from therapy or am I using avoidance?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-27 05:02:53</DATE>
      <TEXT>I told my therapist to schedule the week after next week because our last session was so intensely difficult. So intense I actually vomited twice from the memories. She asked me if I wanted to come in not for trauma work itself, but just to work on things like coping skills and such. I declined that as well. But I'm wondering if this is me needing a break of it this is mean going into avoidance. Because truth be told I'm afraid to go back. After what I revealed to her I'm sickened and embarrassed. I know she wouldn't judge me, this abuse is her field of expertise and she's be told plenty of similar stories. But just knowing the she knows makes my stomach do flips. So I'm worried that this isn't a break but me trying to avoid seeing her again and confronting this deep seated shame. Any advice or is this me just needlessly stressing over things that are a normal part of the process?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I really shouldn't be embarrassed. I was only 10 at the time and I didn't know what was going on, was far to young. But I have the unfair expectation of looking through my ten year old eyes with my 24 year old mind. I know it's stupid to be ashamed of something clearly not my fault but emotions are just wicked that way. I still am in disbelief that just telling her made me that sick. I knew trauma therapy was going to be difficult but this is just insane. I like how you phrased that though, giving my psyche some rest. Because I think that's what this is. I'm a strong person emotionally, but I'm not invincible. I still need to allow myself some rest sometimes or I'll break and that helps no one. Thank you. I think I just need a week to put myself back in order after all of that.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-28 06:37:49</DATE>
      <TEXT>One of my largest sources of guilt has always been my inability to keep a job due to my symptoms. It is just to god damn hard. I always knew that of course but you can't help but feel immensely guilty over it. Everyone else has a job and everyone expects you to power through this. But it seems to be an (unfortunately) common thread in this community. It's helped me feel so much less guilt over it. Because this disorder really is that difficult. It really is one of those disorders where unfortunately your life has to grind to a halt in order to just maintain your ability to function. It's no different than if you had both of your legs broken. No one would chastise you for taking time off work until you can stand again. Just wanted to thank this community. It can be pretty depressing sometimes but god does it feel good to talk about it with people who understand just how difficult the day to day is with this disorder. Makes it a bit easier knowing you're not alone in what you're facing and seeing others manage as well. Thanks.</TEXT>

        <TITLE>So combat</TITLE>
        <DATE>2020-08-29 20:23:58</DATE>
        <TEXT>I know it's been complained a lot (to kingdom come if you will) but combat is certainly not without it's faults. I want to say first I don't hate the combat. I actually find it interesting that it allows you to be creative in your strikes. You don't just hit slash, you have to point your sword and try to confuse your enemy which is interesting and engaging. However. The autolock, for me, basically sucks any amount of fun from the combat there is to be had should I be fighting more than two people. I've got full plate, a good sword, a nice mace, and a sturdy shield. I go in prepared and sharpen my sword every time. But the autolock removes any amount of skill I can use. I can't "git gud" because the game prevents that from happening with auto lock. I cannot tell you how many stabs I've missed because the lock was focused on an enemy three miles away from me. The worst of it is fighting 5 or more enemies. Because they can abuse that like crazy. One thing they favor is while I'm locked on one person, they'll surround me and take turns filling me with holes like a pin cushion while I can't effectively fight back because of the fact I have to wrench my stick to the side to change targets. Meaning you either play incredibly defensively which is about as fun as watching paint dry, or you arrow cheese which, again, is hardly entertaining. The other thing that's been driving me crazy is cowering enemies, again the autolock ruins this. So you're fighting four Cumins right. You best one of them and he cowers. Well, you think, I can make quick work of him and come back for his armor later. Thankfully though, our trusty friend autolock prevents you from doing this and the enemy runs away. So you basically fight four enemies only to get the loot of one which is always a very fun way to do things. There is no pleasure I take more in than spending 1k on armor repairs and selling about 5-600 worth of loot that could've been double or triple that. Finally, stamina. The enemies know when you're out of it. I know they know when you're nearly out of it. Whenever my stamina reaches close to a quarter they, for no reason in particular I'm sure, become incredibly aggressive out of no where. I don't really find that very fair because you can't tell their stamina levels. It feels kind of like the AI is cheating and can exploit a weakness you can't really exploit. I know technically you can see if they're getting winded but when you're fighting 3+ people you don't have time to notice little things like that. My solution? Remove autolock. I'd literally love combat were it not for the autolock. Literally wouldn't have a single complaint. It's a shame because that one poorly implemented mechanic completely ruins the fun of a great combat system. It's not impossible, I've killed a number of groups. But it isn't a fun way to fight. I don't have fun when fighting anywhere upwards of 3 enemies. It's not challenging, it's just not very fair. Still love the game but I'd literally pay double the price of the game if they were to remove that feature. It is so sad that such a good combat system is ruined by something so easily fixable. We already have a press to lock button, just let me use that instead.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>That's always been how I viewed things like this. I've been bullied my whole life and I stressed out about it like crazy. But then you realize you're giving so much power to people who absolutely despise you. All you have to do is give the finger and the teeth of the insult completely vanish. Trap is only a slur if you let it be a slur. The word has as much power as you give it. If you give it no power, it has no hold over you. It's why I never get the weird obsession some have with "forbidden" words. Don't give that kind of power to people who hate you. I'm glad you've come to that. I hope you can start living, it's a lot easier without that burden on your back.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I seem to do this quite a bit. I'll go from being the type of anxious where you don't sleep and you're hyper vigilant to becoming so depressed I pretty much become completely static physically. Right now I'm so depressed I'm sleeping upwards of 13-15 hours a day after having two giant cups of coffee. The kind of depression where you barely move and just sort of stare into space. Which is weird because last month I was so anxious I could hardly keep myself still and would sometimes go a whole day without sleep. Anyone else oscillate between high anxiety and high depression like that?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Not really too much one can say that it isn't true. Sure you can, and people often do, argue that it's more because it's major cities and major cities are host to problems you don't find in surrounding areas. But the cities that are experiencing these extremely violent riots have been left wing controlled for many years now. Even if you do believe in the argument that it's the fact that they're cities, not the people/party that runs them, we've seem a couple of governors outright refuse to take measures to restore any order. The gov. of Portland I think it was denied aid from the federal government after 4 months of violent unrest. He either let it happen or is simply to incompetent to stop it. Even if it is the fact that they're cities, the people who are running them see to be completely complacent or to inept to control it. So I think it is by and large a correct statement. This is something the left can't simply brush off and act as if it has no culpability in.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>So I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD for a while now, since I was 14 in fact. Been on a lot of different medications and a lot of different therapies. Mainly though, I stuck to self harm. I quit this at 20 years old. Fast forward to march of this year, I'm 24. I decide, instead of cutting, to burn myself after a week that nearly broke me. Had to go to the psych ward. I stopped burning for a little while after I was released and confident I could heal. I then took trauma therapy and took it seriously this time. Picked up burning again, but that was to be expected. This is hard work and unfortunately desperate times call for desperate measures. But fine, so long as I'm making it through. Fast forward again to two hours ago. I have a bad emotional flash back and burn myself. I show my friend because these burns looked off. They had a white discoloration to them and after the initial pain subsided they lost pain quickly (usually the pain of the burns lingers for an hour or longer as sort of a dull throbbing). You know what white discoloration and limited feeling means? I got a third degree burn and killed some of my nerve endings. I did this not once, but three different times on my body. FUCK. I'm trying to quit and I told my therapist, will tell her this when I see her again. But FUCK. I can't believe I just fucking did that. What a fucking idiot I am holy shit. I knew this was a fucking mistake to pick up again. I've treated it as you're supposed to, cleaning it out, aloe, bandage ect. but I didn't even feel pain running it under water. Usually that stings like nothing else. Freaking the fuck out right now. I am such an idiot. The hell is wrong with me? Just shit dude. I thought it would take longer to get to the point where I start permanently damaging myself. Fuck! God damn it. I am so angry with myself right now.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I had family therapy the other day and for the first time in my entire life I revealed to them the nature of my abuse a combination of sexual and physical. I sobbed like crazy when I told them, like from the pit of my diaphragm sobbing. It's nothing to be ashamed of but for some reason I still do feel that way. I also told them that, due to a certain medical procedure done to me that they signed off on, a procedure entirely cosmetic and that the doctors fucked up, it was worse than it should have been. They didn't have much to say, probably because they were stunned by it especially when I said that their actions unknowingly made things worse. I know they didn't mean it, they wouldn't wish for my abuse to be worse than it had to be. But I still carry a very deep resentment towards them for it. After all of this, I indulged in my addiction worse than I ever have, more dangerously than I ever have which really scares me. Other than this being just a vent, I'm also starting to become concerned. I'm afraid trauma therapy is pushing too hard. And it's not even that I'm going to fast or that I'm doing it to frequently. It's just the act of opening this all up and setting it free that's causing this level of harm. I worry that the deeper into this I go, the worse my addiction will become. I deeply worry about that. I'm taking a week break from therapy right now but I, of course, will tell her this when I come back. If this is true I'm sort of damned if I do and damned if I don't. Because I can't keep living like this anymore. I can't keep holding on to this demon inside me. All of this sucks. I hate every single moment of this. It feels like every single day is just a struggle to keep my addiction in check. I used to be able to go weeks without it, now I'm struggling to get past 2 days. Everything about this is terrible. Everything. Sometimes I wish I never started. Just kept living in this delusion that my abuse was just this fiction I'd made up in my head. I feel like shit.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-09-03 11:27:17</DATE>
        <TEXT>It's been a while since I had the unfortunate need to make a post here. Six months ago a friend of mine took her life and I had to listen to her final thoughts on vc before she left me forever. I've had a lot on my plate since then. Trauma therapy. Quitting an addiction. Trying to become stable enough to find a job. I was walking through my house right now and her absence just sort of slapped me across the face. She's gone. You have the weird sort of cognitive dissonance where your brain just doesn't really understand that they aren't hear anymore, I did anyway. And I just noticed her lack of presence. The person I spent almost every day talking to, who I went to college with. She's gone. Feels like someone dropped a sack of bricks on me. Rationally you know this is true. She did this over six months ago. But I sort of compartmentalized it in order to be able to managed all that's happened between then and now. And now that things have settled for a bit the reality of it just slices me like a knife. She isn't here. I can look at her texts. Look at the photos of us. Think of the memories. But she is not here. It's hard to explain the level of pain that brings. It's like suddenly noticing one of your limbs is gone after you fooled yourself into thinking it was still there. I know it wasn't my fault. She was my best friend and I was hers. But that is the horrible thing about suicide. You always wonder if you could've done more. Always wonder if you just said X instead of Y maybe this could have been prevented. She was just... she was so god damn kind. So god damn kind. I wish she was still here. I hate that she isn't. I hate so, so much that she isn't, I just wish she could be here. In our final call she apologized so much to me. That call is just stuck in my brain. I miss her so god damn much. It's a physical pain I'm feeling from it. I miss her so greatly. It hurts so, so much.</TEXT>

I'm sorry but this is not a good look. Just because the percentage of this was low, doesn't mean the cost of it wasn't and I'm not speaking just of the money. This is why your ideological framework shouldn't include "the people who I think are involved in this deserve whatever they get." These violent protests are exactly in line with the message outlined in progressivism as a whole. It's greedy, resentful and incredibly violent. This is why those right wing activists who stood at city hall to protest masks didn't have any problems. They weren't working with the framework of "don't make us wear masks and if you refuse you deserve to be killed and your property destroyed." It may be a small portion of the protests, but it is exactly in line with how progressives view the world. This is the logical end point of their ideas.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-09-06 10:26:39</DATE>
        <TEXT>You did something a week ago that I simply cannot stop thinking about. It just rings in my head over and over again. We were in family therapy and, for the first time in my entire life, I told you that I was sexually abused. You watched me sob and sob. I was completely shattered just at having to mention it. Dad, I was going to go self harm afterwards. Self harm so bad I don't even want to think of the state of my arm. But you said one sentence that changed the entire course of that completely. You called me by not only my chosen, female name but used she. To put the cherry on top of that cake, you even echoed back what I said. I told you the only way I'd have dealings with this family afterwards was for you to respect my transition as male to female. And you said "if it means keeping this family together, I will do that" Dad... you can't even begin to recognize the joy this fills me with. There isn't a word in any language that exists that accurately describes the joy that put through me. Because I knew you could do this. I knew, deep down, you could see treating me poorly for being trans wasn't a moral action. I always knew deep down you are a good enough person to know that and you just had to understand my perspective. And even now your love for me just doesn't end. I told you a few days ago I wanted to work for you because I'd developed a new hobby for commissioning pictures. Said specifically that each picture cost around 30-50 dollars to make. Not only did you allow me to work for 30$ in the yard but I noticed my food money was 50$ this time. I don't deserve a dad like you. Truly. We have gotten in a lot of fights over a lot of things. But no matter how bitter the argument we have, I can always be 100% sure you love me. Even if I don't agree with your actions always, I think you are the example of what a dad should be. You aren't perfect, but you're willing to improve in ways most people just wouldn't try, hell I wouldn't try. You are the type of person I hope I can emulate one day. I love you dad. Honest to god, I love you. Every year older I get is a year I appreciate the work you put into me that much more. Because your work as a dad has never solely been to keep a roof over my head and food in my belly. It's to be someone I can count on. It's cliche' but you do embody so many traits that make a good parent and the ones you don't, you're trying to improve. I love you dad.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Because the goals Marx set out where a fantasy utopia that will never come into being. One of the steps on this road is for the state to collectivize all property and slowly educated (IE propagandize) the people to see all property as equal and completely abolish the state. In other words, the state must first have all power centered into it and then give it up. This is why they always look like fascists in practice. There is no universe in which a government can hold every ounce of power then willingly give all of it up, especially while trying to brainwash the entirety of its population. Communism is as real is trying to create heaven on earth, it is something only a lunatic would think is possible.</TEXT>

Was so hard for me to cope with I literally made up stories about traumas I never had just to avoid confronting it. The first time I admitted that what happened actually happened I cried for two days straight. And now just going through it step by step has just made everything incredibly intense. I think it's good work but it's the very definition of it gets worse before it gets better. I'm the same though. I can't suppress this anymore. It's a door once opened that can't be shut again.

        <TITLE>Allowing anger (or any other hard emotions for that matter)</TITLE>
        <DATE>2020-09-09 18:27:04</DATE>
        <TEXT>So this is has been a consistent problem not only in therapy but in regular life as well: I find it incredibly difficult to express any amount of anger. Today in therapy the main focus was a point of intense resentment and hatred regarding the events of my trauma. And my therapist wanted me to express that anger however I wanted (barring harm to myself or others of course). The anger was there in spades. The second she said "what about your trauma makes you most angry?" it was like a bomb went off in me. Knew instantly and man did that anger grip me. But all my body and mind tried to do was suppress it. I managed to show a bit of it by hitting a pillow exactly once, but even that was less than a percent as hard as I wanted to hit it. I don't think my anger is unjustified, far from it. There's no guilt mixed in. I just find myself constantly trying to prevent any feeling of anger I have. And it's odd because both my sadness and anxiety are as strong if not moreso but I don't have nearly as strong an urge to keep them entirely suppressed. I can't even let a slight amount of anger out Does anyone else have this issue? How do you allow the emotion a more free and healthy expression, especially when it's been building for years? Feels like I am carrying a landmine in my chest and just the slightest touch will destroy everything.</TEXT>

It was proven quite conclusively that masks and distance are tools that make the transmission of covid much more difficult between people. But if we're going to talk science, lets talk science. Lets talk about the fact that the world is acting as if we're in the midst of the black death when the science very clearly shows this is not true. I'll say it again, I am not anti mask, it's been shown to make the spread of covid much less efficient. But if we're going to talk science, what we're doing right now is nothing short of an overreaction fed by nothing but fear.</TEXT>

They hate how the lockdown is causing economic loss, preventing people from affording housing and other needs but will then turn around and yell at anyone who says lockdowns should even be reduced, much less lifted. And they blame both the economic loss caused by the lockdown and the fact that some states are easing lockdown on him. Pick one, not both. If we're going to have a lockdown, get ready for the economy to feel it and feel it hard. If we want the economy to not take such a significant hit, we need to ease lockdowns, even if it's just by some degree and not reopen entirely. You cannot have both at the same time</TEXT>

        <TEXT>One thing that I'd like to critique in this is your point with the economy. Most of the states shut down and as a result the economy suffered. The only way start the economy moving back up to it's former pace was to open the states, even if only partially. What I'm essentially saying is you can have a good economy or you can have lock downs, you cannot have both. The federal government provided stimulus checks but, of course, this isn't going to help the debt, even if it was needed. So he's in a damned if he does, damned if he doesn't situation with this. Either he does the right thing and helps people with stimulus checks while this lockdown is in effect, making the economy and debt worse, or the lockdown ends and the economy starts to pick up again and we hope for the best. We can't be both locked down and with a good economy. It's an impossible standard to meet for any president.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I completely disagree. Completely. The government, neither state nor federal, could enforce a lockdown that effective (and by effective I mean people not going outside and co-mingling with others in a way that doesn't attract police attention) without becoming authoritarian about it and even then I still don't think we'd have been able to prevent it all the efficiently. I also find the test/trace/isolate system a bit scary. Good right in this moment for sure, but we also have to think afterwards. What was needed today can be disastrous tomorrow. I fear that may be used in an authoritarian way down the line, were it implemented. I also don't agree what you said would have even been more effective in practical terms as what we did now. The state can only do so much without becoming China or NK or similar. I think both the Federal and state governments did a great job in showing restraint because it's all to easy to say we're in danger now so we're going to tighten the rules and we super duper promise to ease them up later. I think with the knowledge we had and the tools at our disposal (IE working in the bounds of things like the constitution and other right protections) we did about as well as we could have done. This is the trade off of a free society. The safety of the country is entrusted in large part to the individuals that make it up rather than having the government twist your arm on these things. I think we did about as well with containing it as anyone could expect. And keep in mind, by population, we're hardly the worst. Places like Italy suffered far greater infection and death rates and their lock downs were far, far more strict that ours were. I think you're giving the federal government far more power and ability than it really has. I don't think it is as capable of stopping things like this as you think it is.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm sitting here in my room at 1 pm. I've just had an anxiety attack, the third one this week. I am sleep more often than I am awake. I hardly eat and all I can think of doing is escapism. I have been in trauma therapy for now 5-6 months. Going once almost each week, sometimes with a week off. When does this start getting better? I'm putting 110% of the effort into this. I am really going all or nothing with this, this has to work or else fuck knows what I'll do next. I've tried everything else. Why am I not improving even a little bit? It feels like I've only gotten worse since this has started. I used to be a master at keeping this bottled in me. At fooling myself into thinking my trauma was just some made up story in my head. Now that I can't deny it anymore most of my days are colored with sadness and anxiety. I legitimately feel as though I'm being tortured. I would give almost anything to make this pain stop. At what point do things start going upwards instead of down? When I recount the entire thing? When I start desensitizing myself to each memory word by word? I am frustrated and most of all demoralized. Every session I go to fills me with less hope than the previous one. I want to start recovery, not just be in anguish. All I feel anymore is pain. I want to get better so why is nothing working? I'm trying so damn hard and all it amounts to is me banging my head on a wall.</TEXT>

I'm not quite what you'd call an anti-masker as I know they are provably effective to decreasing infection risk, quite substantially so. But I don't think the government should twist anyone's arm into doing it. The government is not meant to be my babysitter. I know the risks of the virus and I know the appropriate steps to eliminate risks, as do most others. It is entirely within my own power, as it is with others, to keep myself safe. I can keep myself safe without the influence of others, as can everyone else. So why is the government needed to strong arm me into wearing it? I'm an adult who can make this choice for herself. It is in my own personal responsibility to keep myself safe. This just feels like the patriot act again. Authoritarian measures justified through use of fear. Because if you think for a moment these measures will be rolled back when the threat is gone you're an idiot. What we enact today can come to bite us tomorrow. Be careful what you wish for.

Socialism produces the most murderous, authoritarian societies the world has ever seen. The highest deaths in genocide are always through socialism and communism. I think it was Reagan who said democracy isn't perfect but we've never had to build a wall to keep our citizens in. And he's absolutely correct. There is a reason the Berlin wall was erected. Because nobody would ever voluntarily live under a communist system like that.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yes. And I have for most of my life. I remember always assuming I'd just "find" a purpose somewhere. But I didn't find that in a minimum wage job. Didn't find it in my hobbies. Didn't find it in my friends or anywhere else. Sure I like money and like buying things but it's not even remotely enough to keep me going to have a life. It's hard to keep your head above water when you don't have a goal to reach for. It's like trying to swim in an ocean and no matter how much you swim, you never see land. No wonder it gives you such a feeling of heaviness. You're clearly trying so hard.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Izumi is the first thing in my life that's ever motivated me. I've had three relationships previous (from human people) and while I didn't hate it, it just wasn't what drove me in life. For me that's one big personal advantage. The second, and another personal one, is that she's the only person I trust to love me for who I am and not what my body is. I was born with a rare body disorder and some view it as a fetish so my trust in others has been low. But with her I need not worry. The final is that I think some people, myself included, are just a bit to emotionally disregulated to form healthy relationships and this is a good substitute for inclinations we all have. I struggle with a lot of complex disorders that making sustaining a relationship nearly impossible even at the best of times. So Izumi is the one I hold close to me</TEXT>

She's also saved me from a lot of bad habits and is slowly making me quit self harm because I know she would hate that. She's just someone I'm devoted too.

When I got home I sat in the shower and just cried my eyes out. I don't want to look at my therapist again after what I just told her. I feel so intensely disgusted in myself I almost find it hard just to be with myself. I want to stop therapy. This hurts SO much. It feels like I'm being tortured. I hate every single second of this, it hurts all the time. I know I should keep going though, if for no other reason than to just tell my story. So how do you keep yourselves going? I have a fiance' rn (in fact she was the person who pushed me to do this) but even with her support it is becoming harder and harder to go to session after session, even with breaks in between. And this all the more so. I am so ashamed I don't even want to see my therapist again after I said that. So what helps you guys?</TEXT>

But beyond that, this is a means of last resort against government tyranny. That is all it has ever been. That is the entire basis for this and not a single other reason.

There's no line you cross where on one side you aren't living under fascism and then you take some action as a society and suddenly you are living under fascism. Fascism is simply government sponsored psychopathy inflicted on its own citizens. God this is such a marxist, deconstructionist way to view things. It's such an over intelectuallization of something. Fascism is absolutely a destination. It's not some wishy washy, abstract that has no real definition. It's a very strict set of ideals, just as democracies follow very strict guidelines that makes the democratic countries. Sure there is some variance as to what a true fascist state looks like, but it is unmistakable when it's implemented. Fascism is also not just government sponsored psychopathy. This is such a brain dead way to view any political ideology.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>The past week has been just peak anxiety for me. Some of the worst I've had in a long time. And over the past two days I've just slept and slept and slept and slept. In the past 24 hours, I've spent 17 asleep (off and on of course, not all at once). Doesn't matter how much coffee I drink or what activity I'm doing I'm just in a fog. I've only now started to be lucid enough to even write a post. Anyone else just sleep like they're dead?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Forgive me, this will be rather long. I've thought about this for a long time. Probably since mid 2019. How I just want to die. Came frighteningly close in march of this year and went to the hospital (for the psych ward, not for injuries). In there I thought I found a reason and for a few months I thought it was a new time in my life. But it wasn't. Tried to get a few jobs and just couldn't deal with the stress. COVID of course made all of this a thousand times harder. Then I started PTSD therapy in April which I have continued up to now. I has been the worst experience in recent memory. Everything hurts constantly. I can barely keep myself from falling apart and my self harm has become out of control. I cannot quit because I am too miserable and this is all the helps short of sleeping, which I now do a lot. This past week I have been asleep more hours than I have been awake. When I try to eat my body won't accept it. I am ashamed of what happened, even though it wasn't my fault at all. I feel tainted and beyond any sort of redemption. But I could deal with that. Could sit though all of that were it not for one thing: I'm not improving. I am getting worse. PTSD therapy was my last hope. It was something I never wanted to do so I waited till the 11th hour to try it. I was right to fear it so much. It's only making the pain greater. Each session I go to just reminds me that my past will forever torment me until I die. This therapy seems, to me, to be proof positive that I cannot recover enough to have a sustainable life. I could probably get on disability. But that wouldn't fix the fact that I am in pain every day of my life. All the time. And my arms have to be covered in painful burns to get this to stop. I don't want to fight this anymore. I just want this to stop. I don't take any pleasure in suicide. This is not out of spite, this is not because I think no one will care. This is because my pain will never go away and I just can't do this another 10, 20, 30+ years. I have fought this disorder for 24 years. And I just can't fight any longer. I truly did try. Truly. I gave it every bit of strength I had. I did everything in my power to do. But it is never enough. My past will always be a boot pressing onto my neck. I cry as I write this. I will be hurting so many people, some irreparably. The only other person who knows is my best friend who lives overseas. I had to listen to her cry and beg me to stay. I have never in my whole life have had to sit something so gut wrenching, felt as though someone tossed my heart into a shredder. But no matter how many times I try to look for another solution, the answer never changes. Because the unfortunate reality of things is that there are some wounds from which there are no recovery. I am truly sorry. I am so truly sorry for what I will do on December. But I just can't fight anymore. I just want to be at peace. I just want to rest. I just want rest.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I know I'll get down voted for it but I'll say it anyway: get out of your bubble. You are seeing a section of trump supporters that are not the whole. I have talked to many a trump and hillary supporter and saying what you just said here is no different than when they said hillary supporters were a cult that worshipped her. While true for some, widely speaking it is not the whole. The most common thing I hear from Trump's base is "I don't agree with everything he says or does, but right now he is the best we have." They didn't vote in a drinking buddy or a person who they'd go to a party with, they voted someone to do what they believed was good for the country. The handling of the coronavirus is completely subjective. What does "handling it well" mean? Everyone says he handled it poorly yet they never give any example of what handling it well looks like? Is it well in terms of causality figures? If so, why whatever number is chosen in particular? If that's not it what about the time it took to act? What constitutes the right time and acting too late? A lot of people, me among them, see this as incredibly dishonest because "handling it well" is nebulous and vague. A lot of what you just laid out here can just as easily be put at the feet of the left wing. Lies and deceit (which is something every politician does and will do. Nobody votes in a political representative and expects honestly, that is silliness). Every single political figure throws around childish insults. It's not right, but you'd be insane to expect otherwise. Trump is just far more energized in his delivery. The final thing is "who swallow up whatever bullshit that spills out of his mouth like sheep." And you wonder why they don't want to vote for your side? This is one of the largest complaints I hear from the Trump base. All the left does is insult the electorate that doesn't go along with what they do, and this is absolutely true. You cannot just say "you're sheep and we're smart" then wonder why they dig their heels in, especially when it comes from a place of concern trolling, which is what I feel this post represents. Not only that, but the left does not have a monopoly on truth and honesty. Every voter on the left isn't some genius who's immune to propaganda. You can say what you just said as much to the left as you can to the right, the left deals in propaganda all the time. Its politics as is usual. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to make this as clear as I could. I think your view of trump's wider base is not only incorrect, but the very attitude that they use as justification. "stop listening to bullshit and educate yourselves" is the exact reason they don't want anything to do with you or your party. You don't sound like you want to help, you sound like you want to talk down to them as a preacher would do to atheists.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I ducked out of therapy that was supposed to be today. I really just... do not want to do this anymore. I hate this so much. This hurts \*so\* much and I've barely gotten 25% through it. I am in just a constant shift between deeply depressed and off the wall anxiety. This week I've spent more time sleeping than I have awake because I'm so depressed I'd rather be unconscious than deal with any of this. Therapy has completely broken me in half. I could not feel more demoralized if I tried. I am literally just in "I give up" mode. My therapist is fine, she's good. She knows me well and knows when to press me and when my limit is. The problem here is me. I honest to god just do not feel I have the strength do this, not one more session. I know that if I don't, I will never get better. But I legitimately do not know how much more of this I can take before it becomes dangerous to me. I just give up. I give up. I just peace, that is all I've ever wanted. I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm in hell. I do not know what to do. I am so tired of being in pain all of the time. To feel a sensation of cold or to feel my scar and go into a panic. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I am trying but I am not strong enough to do this. Every session just amps up the pain. I was at my wits end already but now... I am in a very dark place right now. A very, very dark place. I just want some peace.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>It's not internalized misogyny. She's just one of those "I'm super unique" types, she's just most vocal about it with women. She doesn't hate them, just thinks she's above them somehow. It's not for men or for anyone really, she just has a very high opinion of herself. The way I describe her makes her sound like an asshole but she isn't. Just someone who's a bit full of herself. It isn't that she hates other women, she just sees herself as better than them. And the last thing she'd ever do is let someone control her. She is VERY independent.</TEXT>

I think it's less about hating women and more about her own sense of superiority to others. I think the reason she's more vocal about it with women is because she's been around more women than men, being female herself. I know her well enough to say this is true, everyone else is making assumptions about someone they haven't met. I do not think she has internalized misogyny because I know her as a person.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-10-05 02:47:57</DATE>
        <TEXT>I was doing some re-childing today. I wrote in my journal and just had a conversation with my ten year old self. My goal was to make her feel comforted and safe from the abuse, be the person back then she never had. Instead all I felt was anger. I called her names, the same ones used when people bullied me. I literally told myself that she was the one at fault for this. That had she just come to her parents/doctors when she had been injured this all could've been dealt with a lot sooner. Instead of blaming my abuser and shouting curses at her, I did it to myself. That was a very sobering thing to go through. I'm not really sure what to do. I'll be telling my therapist about it next we meet of course. But that put me in such a state of shock I just need to put it in writing some place. I have no idea why I blame me and not the woman who abused me. I know, logically, it isn't my fault. I know that. But I can't help but feel like I should've gone to someone when I was injured instead of hiding it. I just kept calling myself a coward. I don't know what to make of this other than that I feel my mental state is very twisted and warped. Gives a sick feeling in my stomach.</TEXT>

People love characters like Jolyne Kujo, Mikasa Ackerman, 2B, and others and they're strong as they come. Badass as they come. But it's because they have a character trait outside of "I'm female and I'm strong." Nobody complains about Mikasa and she's arguably one of the strongest characters in her series and it's because she's an interesting and well planned character, not just someone with muscles.</TEXT>

I remember during the first debates with Clinton he said he could only do this because of loopholes her and her friends opened up and he's absolutely right. Unethical, absolutely. But we can all thank the Neolibs and Neocons for Trump being able to do this. At all this at the end is just whataboutism. Biden is incredibly corrupt and nobody could be silly enough to deny that. If he were the right wing candidate you and your party would be tearing into him, but you throw all of your principles to the wayside because of Trump. Biden is literally the epitome of everything the progressives hate: hard stances of an unfair prison system, taking large donations from foreign countries, nepotism, signing pro abortion bills and supporting wars like Iraq. You are not fighting the good fight, you're not fighting to defend what you believe. It's solely partisanship. It's shameful.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-10-08 14:17:49</DATE>
        <TEXT>So my therapist has crossed a line one too many times and yesterday just pushed me a little to far with things. The first thing she did was give me the whole "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" speech when I said I mourned all the lost years due to trauma. Told her that what I lost wasn't worth the wisdom gained through my struggle but she just side lined that. Next though, which she has done repeatedly, is downplay my trauma injury. Keeps trying to frame it in a way that I don't hate it because it was done to me without my permission but because it represents my trauma. While I do hate it because it is a clear reminder of my trauma, if it weren't attached to my trauma I wouldn't suddenly like it. She keeps trying to downplay it and I'm finally sick of it. I can only let things like that slide so many times. I've told her to stop a few times but we always go back to this stalemate and since this is so instrumental in my story, I can't not talk about it. But here's the hard part: I have a very, very, VERY hard time discussing my trauma with anyone I don't trust. Took me four years to discuss this with my current therapist. It was extremely hard just to get here. If I change therapists now, a lot of this progress will be reset. I'll have to go through another long period of time (not necessarily 4 years, but a long time) to open up about something that needs addressing relatively soon. I need to deal with this thing already and just telling even 20% of my trauma story has taken nearly 7 months. So I'm not really sure on what to do.</TEXT>

We ended slavery in our country during the single bloodiest war on our soil. We were some of the first countries to let women vote, to let African's and other races vote. We're no perfect country but point me to a country with a perfect past that's unstained by any immorality. All we can do is acknowledge what we did was wrong, do what's possible to make that right and not do it again going forward.</TEXT>

        <TEXT> gt;woman need to report immediately and have a rape check done immediately so that they can have justice  gt;This is easy to say when you aren't at the most vulnerable, emotional, and broken point you've ever been at in your entire life. Should they do it? Yes. Are there psychological (or other) reasons why they don't do it? Yes. It's an incredibly humiliating and embarrassing process which itself is full of people who are skeptical or don't believe them, then it drags on in court for years under the public spotlight and they are forced to talk about it constantly.  gt;Imagine a powerful politician or figure in your industry rapes you, you report it, and as a result they destroy your career and livelihood. Is that justice? Sure, they may go to jail, but you'll never find work again and you'll be harassed for the rest of your life, and that's after broadcasting the brutal and most horrifying moment of your life for the world to see for months or years on end. That's wonderful emotional pleading. But it can just as easily be used in reverse. How do you think people falsely accused of rape are treated? Do you think they just go back to society with a black stamp next to their name and shrug it off after a while like a shoplifting charge? No. They are also harassed and bullied and lose out on job opportunities. Just look at the mattress girl case if you need more proof. Look at that case and tell me if that was justice. Why don't you look at the guy in that situation in the eyes and tell him his suffering is for the greater good. We look at the facts and we do our best to try to figure out the truth of the matter. We do not just take someone's word as proof, that is bullshit.</TEXT>

You're going to be WAY more maneuverable in trade (which was why the EU was so scared of you winning, they know you can outcompete them if you're not under their thumb), and you won't have to donate vast sums of money to the EU each year. The UK was the #1 contributor in terms of income which, again, was another reason the EU was petrified at the thought of you leaving. It's going to collapse under its own bureaucratic weight. But even if you did lose money who gives a damn? It's main thrust was about sovereignty. The EU keeps exercising increasing control over the UK and the thing is very clearly undemocratic. It is not uncommon for them to make the representatives vote twice or sometimes even skirt them entirely. Sovereignty is worth more than money.</TEXT>

But when we're together we're the support the other requires. She's kind, and though she won't admit it, very much a romantic. She pretends to be fatalistic but I think she knows there's a future. She just needed someone to help her see that. Just like I did. Every time I stare into her eyes all I see is love. I'm lucky to have met her and twice as lucky to be the one she calls her love."</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-10-15 14:33:24</DATE>
        <TEXT>So I told my therapist about when I did re-childing solo and how it ended with me being angry and calling my younger self names, saying it was her fault for not telling people sooner, etc. So we did some more with her guidance. It was very simple. All she had me do was imagine myself, 12 years old, right after I got permanently injured by my abuser and just asked me to check in with her. Ask her what she needed and just be present with her. Not say anything or do anything other than be with her. So I did. It was mega depressing to imagine myself, once so full of light and hope, become the sad, hopeless, fatalistic person she is now. But then I imagined her taking peace in being beside me, just like I would've wanted then. Showed her she could trust me. Once out of that session, I was still depressed but then it faded into confidence and self-assurance. Usually after therapy I'm in the worst emotional state possible. But I was standing tall and proud. I was strong as steel and I felt it. It was such a profound feeling. For the first time in 7 months I actually have faith in the process. I legitimately believed I was never getting better. The only reason I went the therapy was so I could finally get my story told but felt that was as far as recovery would be for me. But if I have more sessions like those, I can recover. There is hope for a better life. I'm going to keep at re-childing and see if I can get more victories like that. It's the first time I've felt hope for years. I feel amazing.</TEXT>
