    <TEXT>Essentialism is the key auxiliary modality and perquisite if we're to bridge the analog-digital divide vis-a-vis bipolarity. This concept -- heterogeneity in ideation -- is not a simple one, and can't be explained in the vernacular. The heuristic *par excellence* would be quantum mechanics, which, I don't need to tell you, is complex and full of contractions. *But your degree is in English.* Precisely!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not the best looking guy. I didn't go to a fancy school. I drive a 2005 Honda Civic. I work as a data entry analyst, and I'll probably only ever achieve middle management. I live in a 300 square foot studio with few possessions. But I have my books to protect me. I daydream about adventures I'll have panning for gold in the Klondike, or taking that perfect photograph of a baby cheetah in the African veld just learning to run, or spending a week with Buddhists in India where I've read time can seem to stretch to eternity. I'm saving up so I can live these daydreams someday. And I'd love to have a partner to share these adventures with. I'm talking to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>KEVIN DURANT INJURY UPDATE - MARCH 29, 2017 Following evaluations by the Warriors medical and athletic training staffs in recent days, the following is an update on Kevin Durant's injury status: Kevin has made very good progress since suffering the injury four weeks ago in Washington. He has not experienced any setbacks to date and has progressed as well as could be expected. At this point, he is being incorporated into non-contact basketball drills - shooting, running and jumping - and the plan is to intensify his level of movement over the next several days, which will include more explosive cutting and lateral maneuvers. His eventual return to contact drills and practice will be predicated upon his progress to the increased intensity of his workouts, and a return to game action prior to the end of the regular season remains a possibility. He will be re-evaluated again in the next 7-10 days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For some people, making a lot of money takes priority. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. You just have to be able to live with your decisions. And it looks like Melo has come to terms with it. I think he realized around 2009-11 or so that he wasn't going to really contend for chips without sacrificing money and spotlight. Just look around him, he had the Celtics, Lakers, and Heat, even Spurs. I think that's why he was very emotional at the Rio Olympics, because he knew his legacy might be as the winningest US Olympic Basketball player of all time, and this too was coming to an end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Q. When you talk about disassociating yourself from the big moments, obviously a lot of players struggle to do it, and I'm sure you struggled to do it five years ago. Why is that so difficult for most players? Why was it difficult early on to kind of be able to not be overwhelmed by the importance of moments in a match? JOHANNA KONTA: I think it's difficult, because you have also got to put things in perspective. Everyone you see playing has been playing since they were a little girl. And it's no secret that to get to whatever sport or even whatever area of life, if you want to be part of the elite and if you want to get to the top of your field, there will be numerous sacrifices you'll need to make. And I think when you get to a position where you might see a glimmer of what you have dreamed of as a little girl or what you hoped for, what you've worked so hard for, it can feel kind of an all-or-nothing moment or what if I never get this chance again? I think it's more a bit of possibly fear of being able to replicate the position you're in more than anything, but then I think that's where you have also got to have a good perspective on things, and you've got to keep, I guess, the simple things in mind of what's important to you. Are you healthy? Is your family healthy? Do you have people around you that you love? Do you have people around you that love you? I know it might sound really mundane and simple, but I guess you've got to, I guess, go back to things that have got substance, and then in the end just trust in the work that you do, if it's in the cards for you that you will get another opportunity or you won't, I think, really love the sport for what it is and be grateful for the opportunities that it brings you, not necessarily what you wish it would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand. But there must be a list of players who have higher nets than Lebron, no?

Lebron would be the 11th best team if a player's net rating is used to rank the entire team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>&gt;On Tuesday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent. &gt;Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered at this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. &gt;Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council. &gt;Numerous previous attempts at changing Assad&#8217;s behavior have all found and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies. &gt;Tonight I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syrian and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We asked for God&#8217;s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who passed. And we hope as long as America stands for justice and peace and harmony will in the end prevail. &gt;Good night and God Bless America and the entire world.</TEXT>

You're conflating "white terrorists" with "Christian terrorists". Probably shouldn't do that. That gaffe notwithstanding, why cite a source from July 2015? Oh I know, cuz 49 people were brutally killed in the Orlando club, Pulse, alone in July 2016.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>&gt;1. The AP reviewed 12 years of UN data on sexual misconduct and exploitation, and found an estimated 2,000 allegations against peacekeepers and personnel &#8212; signaling the crisis is much larger than previously known. &gt;2. More than 300 of the allegations involved children, AP found, but only a fraction of the alleged perpetrators served jail time. &gt;3. A U.N. investigation report from 2007 obtained by AP shows that 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers had sex with at least nine Haitian children. No one was jailed, and Sri Lanka kept participating in U.N. missions in Haiti and elsewhere. &gt;4. Sri Lanka refuses to specify what happened to 23 soldiers disciplined for the child sex ring in Haiti and why so few were punished. &gt;5. In the latest U.N. annual report, Sri Lanka is cited for its "best practices" involving a paternity payment made recently to a Haitian woman. It took Sri Lanka nearly a decade to make the payment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From Wikipedia: &gt;Episodes of stroke and familial stroke have been reported from the 2nd millennium BC onward in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia.[180] Hippocrates (460 to 370 BC) was first to describe the phenomenon of sudden paralysis that is often associated with ischemia. Apoplexy, from the Greek word meaning "struck down with violence", first appeared in Hippocratic writings to describe this phenomenon.[181][182] The word stroke was used as a synonym for apoplectic seizure as early as 1599,[183] and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>&gt;NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying that the U.S-China trade war was taking a toll and emerging markets were struggling with tighter liquidity and capital outflows. &gt;The new forecasts, released on the Indonesian resort island of Bali where the IMF and World Bank annual meetings are getting underway, show that a burst of strong growth, fueled partly by U.S. tax cuts and rising demand for imports, was starting to wane. &gt;The IMF said in an update to its World Economic Outlook it was now predicting 3.7 percent global growth in both 2018 and 2019, down from its July forecast of 3.9 percent growth for both years. &gt;The downgrade reflects a confluence of factors, including the introduction of import tariffs between the United States and China, weaker performances by eurozone countries, Britain and Japan, and rising interest rates that are pressuring some emerging markets with capital outflows, notably Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia and Mexico.</TEXT>
