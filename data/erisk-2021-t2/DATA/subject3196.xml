    <TITLE>Looking for a blank, all black PBT keycap set.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-08 22:44:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lurker's first post. Please be gentle. But as the title says, I'm looking for a place to buy a full set of black, completely blank keycaps, made of thick PBT for use on a Cherry MX keyboard. If I had the option for white or gray keycaps, that'd be great too. I've found the 108-key set from GeekKeys, and so far it's the closest I've found to what I'm looking for, but the issue lies in my keyboard. I have a Logitech G710 with Cherry MX Blues, a keyboard with a non-standard bottom row (1.5, 1, 1.25, 6, 1.25, 1, 1, 1.5, I believe), and backlighting. Basically, I can't find a full set that's compatible with the board, nor can I find a place that sells the extra keycaps I need individually. Also, thick PBT is the only material that won't allow the light to shine through (I'm looking to create just a nice underglow). Those are my issues, and I'd appreciate it if someone here could guide me in the right direction.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone know where to get 6.5 PBT Spacebars?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-27 03:39:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking for a blank, black PBT spacebar for my Logitech G710. I've been searching around for weeks and have yet to find a solid place to get them, although I do realize that 6.5 is a REALLY uncommon sizing. I've tried doing some cutting to my keyboard and a 6.25 spacebar, but with no luck; the spacebar doesn't reach the stabilizers if left alone, and gets locked in place when pressed down by the stabilizers (if anyone has suggestions for me, please help). As of now, I've only found ONE vendor selling 6.5 spacebars, but it's 3D printed, not molded, and terribly expensive. I'm not even sure what plastic is being used. (http://www.shapeways.com/product/QX9MR88R8/blank-spacebar-keycap-6-5x?optionId=34431665)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ducky PBT vs NKPC PBT vs TaiHao PBT vs POK3R Stock PBT?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-10 02:17:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking to get a new set of PBT caps, but the only experience I have with PBT caps are with the GeekKeys set, my POK3R's stock caps, and a brief encounter with a Ducky set. I don't remember enough about the Ducky set to draw a solid conclusion so I'm just looking for answers. Which set is the thickest? Which set is arguably the best quality? I don't care about whether or not it has legends, so that won't be a deciding factor.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thick ABS quality?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-12-07 06:48:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's just something I've always wondered. How is the thick ABS that companies like Originative and Signature Plastics in terms of quality? I'd assume the thickness doesn't do much to prevent the "shining" and general deterioration, so why is it still a popular choice for custom keysets (especially those in SA)? [Edit]: Do these keysets in thick ABS still suffer from the typical ABS shine after extended use?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cryorig R1 CPU Cooler Help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-14 23:08:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've recently purchased an R1 Universal off of /r/hardwareswap and want to take off the slim fan and install two of the full-size XF140 fans, but Cryorig only includes one extra set of clips for full-size fans with the Universal. Does anyone know where I can get just the clips? Will they come with the separately purchased fan? For those who are wondering, I did want the Ultimate, but saw this bargain for the Universal and jumped on it, thinking to replace the fans and plastic covers. MFW someone put an Ultimate up for sale three days later... If there's some subreddit specifically dedicated to CPU cooling that I don't know of please point me in the right direction.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>HD 650s worth the jump from HD 598SEs?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-21 04:45:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, just here looking for feedback. I recently bought a pair of HD 598SEs after giving my old pair of HD 558s to a friend. They were a great pair of introductory headphones, and my friend seems to think so as well (changed his world, lol). That aside, 598s obviously aren't much of an upgrade from 558s. IIRC they're essentially identical, aside from trim and build quality. They still sound very good, and I love them, but now I'm looking more into whether or not I should make a bigger upgrade. I really like Sennheiser as a brand, so I was looking at HD 600s or HD 650s. Are they worth the extra cash over HD 598s? If they are, what are the differences between the 600s and 650s that justify the price difference between them? If there are any other headphones to suggest, I'm definitely looking for a pair of open-backed cans (DT990s? K702s?).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cable combs to fit Silverstone sleeved extensions?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-22 02:19:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently bought some CableMod cable combs from Performance-PCs to use with my black/gold sleeved extensions from Silverstone, after reading some Amazon reviews that stated they were compatible. To my dismay, the sleeved wires did not fit at all, and in trying to squeeze them in, I ended up snapping the bits off one of them. Performance-PCs is pretty strict with how they refund money, and they practically robbed me for shipping, so I'm trying to look elsewhere, in the event that I have to return something again. There are user images of cable combs being used with these extensions, so I'm wondering where else I can get ones that are compatible. This time, the combs definitely have to fit slightly thicker cables, and I would prefer they are made of something more flexible, like a rubber/TPU solution. **TL;DR: Need help finding better cable combs. What do my brothers with sleeved cables use?**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How significantly would the gaming peripheral market be affected if people knew more about mechanical keyboards?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-25 00:31:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>More of a rant than a question, but it's seriously been upsetting me, how gamers seem to identify mechanical keyboards as game changers in their performance, without understanding exactly what it is they bought, and remaining completely ignorant of the vast complexity that is the mechanical keyboard market. Just once I'd like to see someone looking for a mechanical keyboard who *understands* that there is no "best switch for gaming" (or typing, for that matter) or that could look past branding to consider something other than a K70 RGB. Not to be hating on MX Reds and Silents or Corsair, as a mechanical keyboard is entirely subjective, and I know there are people who can justify having one beyond, "because MX Reds are the best for CS:GO," but I'm genuinely wondering if there's anything to be done to educate people on switches, form factors, and *other* brands. I do my best to teach a little when I see an opportunity on /r/PCMR, but one guy can only do so much. /:</TEXT>

It's EVERYTHING that I've been looking for, with a ultra-wide 2560x1440p resolution, IPS panel, and overclocked refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Surely, that sounds too good to be true, especially for this price, so I'm here to ask if anyone else has any experience with this monitor. Is it good? Is bad? Solid build quality? Poorly made?

    <DATE>2016-06-02 21:29:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the water heater mounted on the roof of an office/warehouse started leaking and as a result, it seeped into the room below causing a paint bubble. The bubble was been cut out but the surface underneath had also deteriorated as a result of the water. We bought a ceiling patch kit and tried to resurface it with spackle, but the patches don't adhere properly and fell off. Any ideas how to fix the hole? I've no clue how to replace the actual ceiling material, and feel like I have to now that it's soggy and falling apart. Here are some images to help explain: https://imgur.com/a/wPjF2</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you guys think of Performance-PCs.com? (Rant)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-17 21:55:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't understand how these guys are still in business, or how anyone still recommends them as a place to buy PC components from. Their prices are fair, sometimes less than retail, and while I can understand charging tax (if they have to, they have to), it's ridiculous how even the cheapest shipping option is $11 or more regardless of weight or order value, and not very fast at that. Not only that, but you have to pay *extra* just to have it shipped out the same day. This would be well and good (admittedly, the shipping and tax is not the greatest of evils out there) if it weren't for their return policies though. First, you have to pay return shipping, which I wouldn't mind if it didn't mean I'd be paying shipping for the same item twice. Then, once they receive the item, you have one of two choices: a full refund as store credit, or a refund to your payment method after a *20% restocking fee*. What? Their rationalization behind this sounds fair, as it does take time and effort to retrieve then ship out an order, but as a retailer should it not be your responsibility to offer and front these services to your customers? Also, if I bought ten $1 items, I'd pay less in restocking fees than if I had bought one $500 item. That doesn't make much sense if you're arguing that the 20% fee is to make up for lost efficiency. It's not like you get all your money back when you get it refunded as store credit either; you've already had to pay for two rounds of shipping, and come time to spend your store credit on something else, you still have to pay tax and shipping, *again*. Maybe I'm just a disgruntled customer and my complaints are naive? If so, then I really want to hear how others justify this, as the amount of money I've lost in a single transaction is just ridiculous. I will not be buying from Performance-PCs again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Please leave a comment before sending a PM.** Looking to get rid of a lot of stuff before I move out for college. Everything here is tested and working. **Shipping will depend on where you are and how much you're buying. All items will be shipped in their original packaging unless otherwise stated.** PM me offers as well, if you don't agree with my asking prices. Only thing I'm really looking to trade for is a **128GB/256GB Corsair Flash Voyager GTX** or similar USB 3.0 flash drive. The bigger and faster, the better. [**TIMESTAMPS**](https://imgur.com/a/kSPWc) Item | Description | Price :--------|:--------|:--------- Corsair Air 540 | Used for a little more than a year now.

Would highly prefer local pickup. | $100 NZXT Sentry Mix 2 | Connects 6 fans, but the switch for the fan #2 doesn't work, and the switch for fan #3 controls both fans #2 and #3.

Can provide a CDI if requested. | $55 ~~Silverstone Black/Gold Sleeved Cable Extensions~~ | ~~ 24-pin ATX, 8-pin EPS, and two 6+2-pin PCI extensions, with their respective cable combs.

    <TEXT>For those who remember the NRS, yes, this is an old, *old* bike. The RockShox SID on mine has died (the negative chamber won't hold air pressure) and rebuild kits for this ancient shock are either hard to find or too expensive so I'm looking to get a replacement. Right now I'm looking at a budget of around $200, and have considered a Monarch RL or a comparable FOX CTD. I stumbled upon this sub recently and was wondering if anyone here could help determine which is better? Or if there are other options in my price range I should be looking at. Keep in mind the shock sizing is 6.5 x 1.5". Thanks for your time!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need help trying to lock bike to tray to roof rack; suggestions?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-12 20:30:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I recently bought [these](https://www.ebay.com/itm/192175651268) Yakima fork-mount bike trays, which work great, but I realized too late that these aren't compatible with the SKS locks I have; I can't lock the tray to the rack, nor can I lock the bike to the tray. I'm looking to see if the bike tray is compatible with newer fork-mount assemblies like from the [SteelHead rack](https://www.ebay.com/itm/222465616665 ), or if I can replace the skewer itself with locking skewers from other racks like the [Viper](https://www.ebay.com/itm/172670412901), or the [universal locking skewer](https://www.ebay.com/itm/222006895984). Lastly, is there anyway to secure the tray to be rack itself? Currently, it's mounted with nothing but bolts that could be unscrewed by hand and taken with little difficulty. I can't find any articles/threads regarding compatibility of all these Yakima pieces and am looking for suggestions before I spend any more on this set up (screw Yakima and Thule's nickel-and-dime catalogue for every little thing). Sorry for the paragraphs, and thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Old bike day! 2003 Giant NRS-3 completed build!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-20 00:18:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I commented a couple of days ago on a post asking for riders' current bikes, and after finishing the drivetrain today, my 2003 Giant NRS-3 is finally complete! [Album (specs/notes in image descriptions)](http://imgur.com/a/kQS3Z) My dad bought this bike for me 12 years ago when I was 7, hoping I would join him on our local trails (he was quite the MTB enthusiast in the 90s; took wedding photos WITH his 1995 Univega Dual-Action). Since then I loved mountain biking with my dad, but once I entered high school, I started using this bike to commute, and mountain biking fell to the wayside. After I started working in my junior year, I bought a road bike to commute, and decided to really put some love back into this old bike! Plenty of people suggested that the money would be better spent if I just saved up for a new (used) one; this is true, I've sunk *quite* a bit of money into this bike, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I love this bike, and it means far to much to me and my father. So after a new fork, shock, wheels, tires, bars, stem, grips, saddle, dropper post, a disc brake conversion, tubeless conversion, and 1X drivetrain conversion, my old Giant is finally done! The path to upgrading was pretty rough, what with aging or obsolete standards and compatibility issues, but to those out there like me, who either can't afford a new bike, or want to ride their old one's just a little while longer, I just wanted to prove that your old frame might still be very capable! If anyone out there with old frames are looking to do some upgrades, feel free to ask me! I've learned quite a bit about old standards, and some tricks or products to adapt them to modern parts. Hope you guys like my bike as much as I do. Cheers! Edit: [Just went for a ride](http://i.imgur.com/r2vOmqe.jpg); hope all of you are having a great summer!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RockShox Recon Silver TK Motion Control damper swap; help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-28 20:00:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/6g2a3l/rock_shox_recon_silver_tk_damper_quick_upgrade/?st=J6WKZN7W amp;sh=44fdff53) on swapping the TurnKey damper out for a MotionControl damper, and wanted to do the same for my fork, which is a Recon Silver TK, 26" 100mm travel. But, I found [this MotionControl damper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006KV6W5K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_zuhPzbFDVB25A) that looks made for the Recon, instead of using the Argyle damper that the original post instructs. The only review there describes a swap for a Recon Silver TK, but in 29" size with 120mm travel instead. Would this damper still work in my fork? The reviewer also explained that the oil volume did not have to be adjusted, whereas the original post says to adjust the oil level and move the seal. Also, it looks like this damper is meant to be used with remote lockout, something that I don't want. The same review mentions that it's easy to make it work as a non-remote damper, but I'm not sure I understand what exactly he did. Could I pair that damper with [this top cap assembly](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CJXBUE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_txhPzbNE9EVTY) instead? Or are the remote and non-remote dampers two different, incompatible parts? I'm probably going to call SRAM directly for help as well, but I wanted to see if anyone here also had experience with this swap and could help me out with first-hand tips. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RockShox Recon TurnKey to Motion Control swap; what differences should I feel?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-15 00:31:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I swapped out the TurnKey damper on my 26" Recon Silver TK for a MotionControl damper, and am struggling to really see the differences in feel, so I wanted to see if I'm doing or understanding anything incorrectly. As I understand, the main difference between the TK and the MoCo damper is the MoCo's ability to adjust low-speed compression. Wouldn't this mean that when fully open, the damping performance of the MoCo and TK dampers are the same? Basically, should I feel better small-bump sensitivity or anything like that? And since I don't, is there anything I can do to really optimize the performance of the new damper? Should I be lowering my PSI and increasing compression? RockShox recommends 100-120psi for my weight, but even with the TK damper I was riding at about 75-80psi, with the rebound in the middle. Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Have a betta and a new 10G tank, but need a quick cycle; does API QuickStart work?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-20 06:52:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>First time in this subreddit, but I'm hoping I can get some better answers to my dilemma here. So I recently won a crowntail betta from a carnival my workplace hosted, and having taken care of bettas before, I couldn't stand to leave him in the little cup he came in. Unfortunately, my old 3.5G tank is now populated by some goldfish, so I used this opportunity to start a new 10G community tank. I plan on having a bristlenose pleco, since I've always had a problem with algae, and either a school of neon tetras or a handful of panda cories, but I've been reading that all these fish are very particular when it comes to tank stability. I never cycled my 3.5G tank, and it seems to have worked just fine, but I want to do things properly now, and am not sure of the quickest way to do it. I don't want to leave the betta in a plain 1.5G bowl with little more than a heater cable coming out of it and some rocks for weeks. Basically, I'm looking for the fastest way to cycle a tank, and came across API QuickStart, which looks like what is essentially a bacteria supplement that can jump start cycles. I'm not sure if it's a viable option or just a sham that isn't as effective as a proper cycle. Anyways, thank you for reading, and thanks for your help! TL;DR Won a betta and want to take proper care, but don't have weeks to wait before putting him in a cycled community tank. What's the fastest, best way to set up the 10G tank?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I go to school in Riverside but commute all the time between there and San Gabriel valley, so I have a pretty large radius that I'm willing to visit. All the stores here in Riverside (*every single one*) is saltwater, and charges so much for their small selection of freshwater fish. I have a PetSmart and Petco, but its a shot in the dark whether they even have the fish in stock, and after asking the employees, they almost never have them in quantities of more then 5-6 at a time. I'm thinking I might have to be patient and just buy whatever fish I can from whatever store, but I'd like to know if there is a good freshwater store around me that I can visit. For reference, I'm looking for Panda Corys, Harlequin Rasboras, Celestial Pearl Danios, and a Bristlenose Pleco. I'm also looking for Neon Tetras, but there are plenty of those at PetSmart and for only $1 each. Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Goldfish HATE new tank LEDs; help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-14 08:07:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently bought the [NICREW LED Aquarium Light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ID3OK3S/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_wrC4zbQY8XN7M) off of Amazon and think it looks amazing, but the four goldfish living under it seem to hate it. They #8217;ll swim around just fine with the lights off, but the moment they come on, they go into a panic and duck underneath the silk plants I have in the corner of the tank; they #8217;ll actually stay there for quite some time even after the lights have been turned off. Even food won #8217;t lure them out with the lights on, and they swim fairly cautiously in general. They used to swarm whenever anybody walked by in their old tank, but now they either keep to themselves or hide away. They #8217;re always grouped together now as well. They were just moved to this tank (20 gallon long, and YES I KNOW THAT #8217;S SMALL FOR GOLDFISH IT #8217;S NOT PERMANENT), and are still tiny, so is this just a case of them needing to be acclimated to the new tank, or are the lights really too bright for them? The tank is cycled, there are a handful of decorations, and the substrate is pool filter sand, which I read can reflect too much light for the fish? Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Where to get 40G breeder hood/canopy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-18 05:31:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been looking for a one-piece, 36x18 #8221; glass canopy or hood for weeks and I haven #8217;t had any luck. I considered going top-less, but the NICREW LED light strip I #8217;m putting over it isn #8217;t secure enough on its own, so I really want a canopy over the tank. The Aqueon and Marineland glass canopies at Drs. Foster  amp; Smith are both meant for tanks with center braces, which doesn #8217;t fit as 40G breeders never come with center braces, and I #8217;m not sure how to put one in. The one-piece Aqueon one on Jet.com was promising, but as someone else here posted, mine arrived in no extra packaging; just the retail box with a shipping label on it. Of course it came broken, but it wouldn #8217;t have fit anyway; it #8217;s a few millimeters too wide. So now I know I need the Marineland canopy but I can #8217;t find any from good sites that are one-piece 36x18. Does anyone have experience with [ThatPetPlace.com](http://www.thatpetplace.com/marineland-perfecto-glass-canopy-36in-18in)? *TL;DR: People with 40G breeders; where did you get your canopy/hood, where can I get one, or what other suggestions do you have?* Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Emerald cory and betta random death?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-24 03:10:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>[EDIT] I just got back from another shift and I found one of my panda corys dead. About half of his tail was gone and all of my corys are very lethargic in general. Every single one is still as a rock; not moving. I can #8217;t remember how they were last night, but again, I know they were fine on Friday. All of my corys, the emerald ones especially, are usually very active, either surfing up and down the tank or scampering around in packs. Right now they #8217;re all completely still, and movement is minimal. [EDIT #2] Turned off the lights and the corys are acting as they did before. Seems they were just waiting for night to come. [EDIT #3] Woke up this morning and after a feeding I noticed another emerald cory has been injured. His right pectoral fin is basically missing; it looks like a twig, and he #8217;s swimming lethargically around the tank, at its bottom 1/3 height. He won #8217;t sit down and rest and he isn #8217;t digging through the sand; just swimming around mid-tank. He #8217;ll still dart away when I get close and appears to be otherwise healthy. No bruises or lacerations, just the torn fin. I have a community in a 40G breeder and while I was gone this past weekend I #8217;ve had two (now three) unexplained deaths. My betta died while I was at work on Sunday and by the time I got back his body had decayed enough that I couldn #8217;t make out any details. The cory I found after coming back from work today. It looked like he had [a big bruise down the side of his body](https://imgur.com/a/7Qfb5). No, I didn #8217;t leave him in the tank; I propped him up on some plants before fishing him out so I could get a good picture. This community had been established for about a month now, and the tank is fully cycled and overfiltered, with two Emperor 400 HOBs. It contains: 1x betta 15x neon tetra 16x harlequin rasbora 10x panda cory 6x emerald cory 2x clown pleco Water parameters were: 0 ammonia 0 nitrites 15 nitrate 79 degrees F I do weekly 30% water changes for the nitrates. I suspect the betta may have been stressed in the end by the other fish or the current from the filters may have been too much? He was not aggressive towards any of the fish and was eating fine before I left on Friday. Unless the cory #8217;s injuries resemble something else, I #8217;m fairly confident he was attacked but I #8217;m not sure by what. The clown pleco? I know it #8217;s a shy fish but it #8217;s tough and can swim pretty aggressively. Any ideas? I #8217;m desperate for any help right now. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are my clown plecos attacking and killing my other fish?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-25 19:38:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I made [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/78d2fa/emerald_cory_and_betta_random_death/?st=j97fdi4k amp;sh=4bc490f6) a couple of days ago following five unexplained deaths in my 40 gallon community tank. I left for the weekend on Friday, and when I returned Sunday night, my male betta was dead, and appeared to have been for at least a day; I could not make out any details on his body. After coming back from a shift Monday afternoon, I found one of my emerald corys dead. I didn't see a lot of fin damage, but [his entire right side looked severely bruised](https://imgur.com/a/7Qfb5). I worked another shift that day, and got back home late at night to find one of my panda corys dead as well. Half his tail was missing, and his fins were torn as well. I woke up Tuesday morning and while feeding my fish saw that another emerald cory was injured; his right pectoral fin was nearly gone, and he was limping around the tank for the entire day. I never saw him stop and sit on the sand as corys do, and he died later that night. That same night, while fishing out the last emerald cory, I found one of my neon tetras with a bite taken out of his belly. Like I said earlier, this community had been established for a little over a month, and the tank had been cycled for nearly half a year. Parameters were: 0 ammonia 0 nitrites 15 nitrates 79F I do weekly 30% water changes to account for the nitrates. The tank is stocked with 1x male betta, 2x clown plecos, 6x emerald corys, 10x panda corys, 15x neon tetras, 16x harlequin rasboras, and overfiltered with two Emperor 400s. Something in my tank has been killing fish and I can only assume it's the clown plecos, only I can't find any cases of clown plecos in particular attacking and killing fish. I feel as I should mention that these clowns have had no interest in algae wafers or fresh zucchini. I understand they can be territorial and aggressive, but the majority of cases regarding plecos in general all insist that plecos are a peaceful fish that really just mind their own business. I've since removed the two clown plecos from the tank, and intend on returning them; hopefully I don't get anymore casualties. **TL;DR Five fish have been killed in my tank; are clown plecos the killer? Has anyone else experienced aggressive plecos going so far as to attack other fish?** Apologies for the long post, and thank you for reading.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can't decide between ITR or A-Spec lip kit for 2003 RSX Type-S</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-21 08:53:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title says, I'm at a loss between the two. I'm already getting the A-Spec wing, so I just need to decide on which lips to put on. Part of me wants to get the A-Spec because we actually got that in the US, so it would be OEM accurate, and the side skirts are more common/affordable. Also, the A-Spec kit looks really nice in Desert Silver Metallic. But the other part thinks the ITR rear lip looks so nice, and I like the more subdued front and side lip as well. Only problem is ITRs didn't come in DSM, and even if I had it painted Eternal Blue Pearl (which would be my dream paint), my Titanium interior wouldn't match. Just looking to get some other input while I debate between the two. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Type R Brembo swap, what size wheels/spacers will clear?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-30 22:25:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking to do a Type R Brembo swap soon, as well as new wheels, but all the info I #8217;ve found online is confusing. The ITR 17 #8221; wheels are 17x7 +60 offset while USDM RSXs came with 16x7 +45 offset on the Type-S (which I have). With the difference in offset, I #8217;d need a 15mm(?) spacer, which would also require extended studs because the USDM ones aren #8217;t long enough, and this is IF I decide to use the ITR 17 #8221;s. BUT, the Type R Brembo brake swap comes with ITR hubs, spindles, and a rear control arm assembly, so I wouldn #8217;t need to use spacers for the ITR wheels, right? Then what happens if I decide on something other than the ITR wheels, then would I still need to find a +60 offset rim for the ITR hubs and spindles? I could instead avoid the ITR brakes altogether and use 350Z Brembo calipers and AP1 S2K rotors, but then I #8217;m still not sure what size offset I should be getting to clear the new calipers. And this is without mentioning clearing the control arms or having to roll fenders... I #8217;d really prefer not having to roll my fenders, but if anyone else here has done the Brembo swap, I #8217;d appreciate any advice! Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>5.06 ITR or 5.4 Final Drive?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-03 22:31:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Am anticipating some transmission work and thought I might as well get everything I wanted done at once and never worry about anything tranny related for the life of the car. I #8217;m getting an MFactory LSD and a TSX 6th gear swap, but need help deciding which final drive ratio to install. The Type R final drive is a safe bet but it #8217;s hard to find concrete numbers like 0-60 and top speeds per gear. But in for a penny, in for a pound, should I just go for the 5.4 FD and get all the sweet torque? A lot of conflicting information over what #8217;s daily-able and what #8217;s too short for street driving so hoping people can chime in here. Also, people with MFactory LSDs, is it worth it to get the Stage 1 RacePack upgrade? Higher torque bias means better cornering and more power transfer but also means more heat, so I #8217;m wondering if it has any significant negative impacts on the car, or if it #8217;s worth the premium over the standard unit. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2003 Acura RSX Type-S rattling/grinding from transmission only when in gear and off throttle (engine braking). Can #8217;t figure out where it #8217;s coming from and is driving me nuts!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-07 18:54:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have a 2003 Acura RSX Type-S, 122K miles, original engine/transmission and there #8217;s a rattling/grinding coming from the front driver side of the car, where the transmission is. -The rattling sounds dry, almost like a bad bearing or something small is loose. Kind of like a grinding. Sounds like it #8217;s coming towards the middle of the car on the driver side. -It rattles **only** when the car is moving, in any gear, off throttle (engine braking) and **only** between 2500-3500RPM -It does **not** rattle in neutral, rolling or idle. -It does **not** rattle when I rev the engine in neutral or at higher speeds, only off throttle at the above RPMs. -The rattling does **not** get worse with speed. If I am in that RPM range in any gear and off throttle, it will rattle. Here #8217;s what I #8217;ve done: -I thought it was the heat shield on the intermediate axleshaft or header, so I removed both entirely but the sound is still there. -I don #8217;t think it #8217;s suspension or engine, or I would hear it in neutral at any speeds or when the engine was turning at all. -I thought it would be a wheel bearing or bad inner CV joint, but that noise would get continually worse at speed. -I #8217;m thinking it could be the springs on the clutch or pressure plate; that they #8217;ve worn out and are vibrating on the flywheel. The springs are under load only when throttle is applied so they can vibrate when off throttle and when engaged (in gear). -I thought it could be the differential bearing that the intermediate shaft goes into, but a friend pointed out that everything in the transmission is lubricated and would not grind or rattle like that. I #8217;m anticipating having to drop the transmission, which is a big job for me and will take a while, so I #8217;m hoping anyone here can chime in and give me a better idea of what it might be/what I should look into replacing. I #8217;ll see if I can get a good enough recording to show what I #8217;m talking about. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[USA-CA] [H] EVGA 980Ti Classified, PayPal, Local Cash [W] EVGA FTW3 1080Ti, 2080Ti, PayPal, Local Cash</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-05 21:16:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Picked up a nicer monitor for myself while I hand down my current one to my girlfriend, so I'm "in need" of some more horsepower. 980Ti Classified was bought here on hardwareswap BNIB about 3.5 years ago. Never checked on the warranty, but serials on the box and card match. Card was never overclocked, and never mined on; just used everyday for light gaming, etc. Comes with the original box and all accessories. **Asking $220 shipped/$200 local cash.** [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/Zu6eWoT) Really looking to **buy/trade** for a 1080Ti, but will consider a 2080Ti if the price is right. Definitely prefer the FTW3 models of either card. Am local to CA-92507, but am making a trip up to NorCal this weekend and am willing to make a detour to pick up a good deal. *Please comment before PM'ing*, thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Aight boys, I #8217;ve been out of the game for four years and now have no idea how hooking up RGB works. Help for an old PC grandpa?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-25 20:52:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full disclaimer, I #8217;m not actually a grandpa but y #8217;all might as well be calling me that since I #8217;ve been out of the game for so long. So here it is: I finally retired my trusty 980 Ti Classified to my girlfriend and picked up a shiny new (used) 2080 Ti FTW3, which I noticed has a 4-pin RGB header on the side. Now, my understanding is that you can use that header to sync other RGB things in the case? Or do you connect that to a RGB-sync compatible motherboard to sync the GPU to the rest of the system? My motherboard doesn #8217;t support any form of RGB sync (Sabertooth Z97), but my case (Evolv ATX TG) does, albeit it #8217;s limited to Phanteks specific led strips, which are connected to a basic LED controller on the case itself (it can switch through seven or so colors and breathing or cycling). I guess the crux of the question is this: what would I need to fully RGB-out my build? I #8217;d have a total of seven fans and three LED strips, all sync #8217;d, preferable to the LED that #8217;s also on the front of the case What LED strips would I use? Would I need a hub like the Corsair Node or Commander? What fans are compatible with which hubs? I #8217;d like to use Cougar HPB RGB fans, but I suppose the default would be the Corsair LL series, since those appear to have the most support? Thanks for reading, and I hope y #8217;all can help me out, because I #8217;m honestly lost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The final drive is not the same as the final gear. The final drive is the largest ring gear that the output shaft from the engine spins. Changing the final drive effectively changes all the gear ratios at once, making them taller or shorter. The ratios between gears 1-5 don #8217;t change, so the VTEC band doesn #8217;t shift, it just means you #8217;ll accelerate quicker. I paid $450 in flat-rate labor when I had my trans worked. He inspected all the gears and synchros, replaced all the bearings, and installed a new final drive, LSD, and 6th gear swap. [Album](https://imgur.com/a/9EuGKFK)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Build the bottom end, either stroke it or use a K24 block. Have the engine worked to support higher revs (crank, pistons, cans, valvetrain, oil pump). ITBs will help too. Up compression closer to 12:1 and up revs towards 9.5K. You'll never get as much power as a boosted set up, but I feel like boosting a high-revving VTEC engine kinda defeats the purpose. I like turbos too, but I like my K20s all-natural.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have basically the same opinions on all the 9mm sub-machine guns: great guns, terrible ammo. And when I say terrible, I really mean just not cost-effective, unless you #8217;re dead set on leg meta which is definitely a disadvantage over just shooting center-mass. AP6.3 is 800 per bullet and can only consistently pen level 3 armor. RIP does gobs of damage but again, is 800 roubles a shot. The only cost-effective, viable way to kill with 9mm is hitting people in the legs with Luger GCI, which is just not as easy as spraying someone down with 5.45 BS or BT or 5.56 855A1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stock for stock, a Type S will be faster than a DC2 GS-R or a Celica GT-S. The K20A2 just makes better power (not just more, *better*) than the B18 and the 2ZZ. It #8217;ll handle better than the Celica any day of the week, but not the Integra. Where it falls short though is suspension geometry. If you throw coilovers on any of these cars the DC5 will starts to show its weaknesses with bump and torque steer. There #8217;s a post on the sidebar I made on DC5 suspension tuning that you can give a read if you #8217;re interested. With a few geometry tweaks and an LSD, the Type S drives like it #8217;s on rails, and I #8217;m very happy with how it turned out. If you #8217;re looking to autocross a base model, I #8217;d recommend good tires and A-Spec/Type R struts; all you need to do to make a great little track car. Coilovers will only make it less comfortable and handle worse without geometry adjustment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s not an authentic brace lol. Mugen made three braces for the DC5 chassis: the front strut tower bar, rear strut tower bar, and rear tower bar. This one installed behind the rear seats would be the rear tower bar, but the real Mugen brace is much thicker and rectangular in shape. It braces the c-pillars together and requires you to make cuts in the plastic paneling on either side.

    <TEXT>Um. We do? The first round of AUDM Integra  #8220;Type R #8221; models from 2002 are mechanically identical to USDM 02-04 RSX Type S models. They didn #8217;t get the K20A or the LSD transmission, nor did they get the Type R front running gear with the brembos, just like USDM Type S cars. They did get the Type R lip kit and interior though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>05-06 Type S and Type R models have thicker subframe braces front and rear. Otherwise, all DC5 bodies/chassis are identical. Mechanically, the Type S has bigger front brakes and a different proportioning valve to accommodate them. in the US market, base model and Type S struts are identical; only the Type S with the A-spec package got stiffer struts. Type R models have different front lower control arms, sway bar, and knuckles for the Brembo brakes and 30mm wider track width. They also have stiffest stock suspension on DC5s; marginally stiffer than the A-Spec struts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey man! Welcome! Can #8217;t say much about those Facebook groups but I #8217;m always happy to answer questions about these cars. Like u/raftah99 said, there #8217;s a [write up I made that #8217;s been out in the subreddit #8217;s sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura_RSX/comments/dvmrhz/does_anyone_auto_x_their_rsx/f7dwaft/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf ) that you can give a read if you #8217;d like. I #8217;d be happy to answer any questions you have about it. It hits all the points you #8217;re talking about and yes, lowering the car will severely compromise suspension and steering geometry, so many people who just slap coilovers on end up with a worse handling car. Inverted tie rods, extended ball joints, and a new steering rack slider all work in conjunction to remove those issues. Either that, or just run stiffer struts (A-spec/Type R) at stock height! That will give you the best balance of value, performance, and comfort out of a DC5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also think they #8217;re expensive for what they are, especially considering they #8217;re still wear components (tie rods don #8217;t last forever). If you #8217;re looking at the K-Tuned set, the outer tie rods are the ones that fix the suspension geometry, so those are technically more important, but I would recommend saving up to buy the inner/outer set. The inner tie rod is also spherical meaning its movement is much stiffer than an OEM rubber one; it #8217;ll last much longer as well. They also have much more toe adjustment, which can be handy depending on how much you #8217;re trying to lower the car. They #8217;re also cheaper if you buy them together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve used VHT wrinkle red and gloss yellow; both came pretty mediocre and took way too much time. I #8217;d recommend just saving up a little and paying to get it powder coated. It #8217;ll come out infinitely better. But as far as my experience goes, the wrinkle red goes on very thick and is way too easy to spray too heavily, so I ended up with a lot of overspray and dripping. With the gloss yellow, I had to use something like 4 or 5 cans before I got a good solid coat of yellow. After each can it looked as though I could still see the primer underneath. Also because I had to use so much paint (and clearcoat on top of it), once it chips, the paint is so thick that other bits chip off with it very easily. Took like three or four days between stripping, sanding, masking, and painting before I was happy with the results. TL;DR save your money, and pay to get it powder coated. Most places can have your valve cover back in a day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can ask around but I usually see around $150-175 for a valve cover at shops that specialize in automotive parts. I used a heat gun for the wrinkle. After that it has to be left to cure though. An oven is ideal but mine wasn #8217;t big enough so I made a tent using one of those metallic emergency blankets next to my fireplace and basically cooked the valve cover under that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Like I said above, the biggest problem with the gloss yellow was that the coverage was poor. I could still see the primer underneath after several coats. Maybe my prep work was bad, but that #8217;s all the more reason to go to a professional. A metal wire brush and sandpaper might work, but they can #8217;t beat a chemical bath and sandblasting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;small increase in  #8220;tramlining #8221; That my friend, is bump steer, and it #8217;s probably the single biggest problem with the DC5 chassis. On A-Spec and Type R struts, the minimal drop means characteristics aren #8217;t worsened severely, but your hunch is on point; if you were lowered any more, it would be much worse. If you #8217;re interested in fixing it, take a look into inverted tie rods. Normally, I #8217;d recommend extended ball joints (roll center adjusters) as well, but since you #8217;re riding a mild drop on OEM struts, you shouldn #8217;t need more geometry adjustment. But other than that, I applaud your work. Excellent intuition with the geometry changes in the steering, and perfect choices in suspension/tire size selection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An LSD is always a great option for these cars, and if you have the means, I always recommend it. Changed the car completely for me, and that #8217;s at almost stock power. With a supercharger, you #8217;d definitely feel more of a difference. If you #8217;re not planning on tracking the car, I would leave the final drive alone. IIRC you have an 02-04 with the taller 4.3FD. The taller final drive compliments daily driving much better, and with the SC, you #8217;re not exactly hurting for torque. Where a shorter final drive really helps is with gears 2-5, which matter much more in a track setting. NA cars need all the help they can get to put the power down, so you hear people running things as aggressive as a 5.4 (I have a 5.1 myself). But SC, the shorter final drive would probably leave you spinning in 1st and maybe 2nd if you #8217;re on street tires. 4.7 is the OEM ratio for the Type R and for 05-06 Type S cars, so the difference wouldn #8217;t be severe, but I would just save the money, again, since you #8217;re not interested in tracking the car. If you are opening the transmission up though, consider an FA5 Civic Si or CL9 TSX 6th gear swap for the taller ratio. You #8217;ve got the torque, so you #8217;d still be able to pass on the highway, but you might be able to increase your gas mileage pretty significantly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fun? Yes, absolutely. Fast? Maybe not by hype standards these days, but any car that can do 0-60 in 6 seconds or less is fast in my book. It #8217;s more than fast enough to get yourself into trouble if you #8217;re not careful. The AP2 fixed a lot of the stability issues people had with the AP1, but some consider that a downgrade as being less  #8220;twitchy #8221; also means it isn #8217;t as playful or quick to react. FWIW I think the AP2 is the better car. It #8217;s easier and safer to drive harder than an AP1. That isn #8217;t to say it #8217;s  #8220;safe #8221;. What goes for the S2000 goes for any RWD car: respect the throttle or snap oversteer *will* get the best of you. 04-05 model years are ideal in my book, as you got all the AP2 improvements, but in 06-09, they moved to fly-by-wire throttle, which, to be honest is a very minor change to the overall car. Definitely look out for tears in the soft-top around the  #8220;C-pillar #8221; area of the car. It #8217;s a very common occurrence due to weak OEM straps holding the top in place while opening/closing.</TEXT>

If you wanted something a little more aggressive, 235/45 is a little less sidewall, but a rounder profile. $1200 isn't bad. It's just fair. These wheels straight from Japan were in the $330-350 per wheel price range, so depending on the condition you could try and talk him down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Acuity](https://www.kseriesparts.com/ACI-1887.html) or [MTEC](https://www.icbmotorsport.com/mtinupshlesp.html) shifter assembly springs that go into the transmission. Then the [K-Tuned shifter spring and delrin pivot ball](https://jhpusa.com/products/k-tuned-k-series-shifter-pivot-ball-spring-02-06-rsx), or you can get the whole [billet arm](https://www.kseriesparts.com/KTD-BIL-ARM.html) if you have the budget for it. [Billet shifter base bushings](https://www.kseriesparts.com/KTD-SFT-BUS-A.html) help a little, but shifter cables or cable bushings do almost nothing and aren't worth the cost, unless the OEM bushings are torn to pieces (which the probably aren't). I'm not even going to link the cables because I'm tired of seeing people waste money on those or claim they make a difference. They don't. Pair the above springs with a lighter shift knob (OEM, etc. I use the Spoon aluminum knob) and you'll have a super tight OEM shifter with clean throws and stiff springs. Heavier, weighted knobs feel nice and smooth in the throw, but having more weight on the shifter arm and springs makes slop more noticeable. Short-throw shifters are stupid expensive and IMO don't give you that same clean throw and engagement that the OEM box does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably not. These parts are pieces I recommend any owner install, but they won't fix a misbehaving transmission. 2nd gear grind/3rd gear pop-out are very common issues on all K-series transmissions, and it's just a sign that your synchros are nearing the end of their life. The only sure-fire fix is to have them replaced (OEM only, none of that carbon synchrotech made-in-China garbage), but that's expensive and time-consuming. A band-aid fix would be to experiment with transmission fluids and to change them often. I use Honda MTF and have had no issues in the 50K miles I've owned mine; my car is at 145K right now with all OEM synchros. Amsoil GM Synchromesh with the friction modifier is what a lot of other Honda owners will swear by as well, and is what I would try if Honda MTF isn't working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Increasing rear camber doesn't add traction it actually removes traction and makes the car more unstable, which is why I tell people anything more than -2 degrees out back is really unsafe for street driving, particularly if you're running a stiffer rear sway bar. If you want to read up on suspension tuning, I have a short write-up that was added to the sidebar [[here]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura_RSX/comments/dvmrhz/does_anyone_auto_x_their_rsx/f7dwaft/) that you can read up on if you're interested. Generally speaking, if you're looking at track time, you want negative camber out back to encourage rotation, but if you're driving around on back roads I'd recommend you stay near stock alignment specs for safety. All it takes is one off-camber corner and a bad throttle input to total your car. All rear camber arms are basically identical for the DC5. Pick the cheapest one or the prettiest one; they all do the same thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah the S2000 filter (PCX-004) flows marginally better but is double the cost of a regular A02 or A01 filter.

    <TEXT>You can have an LSD installed in any K-series transmission. I #8217;d recommend any helical one, since those don #8217;t take any extra maintenance other than changing the transmission fluid. Clutch-type LSDs aren #8217;t as straightforward with their engagement and must be removed from the transmission to have the clutch packs replaced periodically. I had my A2 trans rebuilt with an MFactory helical-LSD, Spoon 5.1 final drive, and FA5 Civic Si 6th-gear. K-series transmissions are all similar enough that a lot of parts are compatible with others. I #8217;d recommend replacing the sway bar end-links if they #8217;ve just never been replaced before. The rubber bushings and ball joints will be worn to pieces if they #8217;re original.

I should mention that this only applies to Type S models. Base model RSXs had a different proportioning valve since they came stock with smaller front brakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A base model RSX is nothing more than a prettier Civic coupe, and as such is a great first car. Cheap to own, cheap to maintain, and great on gas. If you treat it well, it will last you a long time. I wouldn't recommend doing any kind of performance upgrades to a base model beyond some decent summer tires (maybe all-seasons, since NY gets pretty cold), so you've already got the right idea. The Type S is a decent platform for performance driving, but the base model is just an economy car; there is quite a lot differentiating the two models. If you're just looking for a comfortable daily, refresh the suspension with new OEM struts/bushings/engine mounts and if you want, tinker a bit with the audio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a base model. Keep it clean, keep it running, keep it stock. If anything, get a decent set of tires and learn how to drive in a slow, *safe* car. You could even try autocross. Don't spend any more money than you have to on this car, so you can save up for something else (a Type S or an engine swap, if you really want) and know how to handle a faster car when you finally get it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You've got a great mindset, and don't let anyone change it. I was fortunate enough to start with a Type S, but it was the same story for me. Bought it after my senior year of high school to commute to and from college and work. I've definitely given it its fair share of hard work over four years, from 80mi daily commutes, to road trips and track days, but these are stout cars, and they'll keep on kicking. It's a Honda at its core, so it's a great car to learn on, and doing preventative maintenance will teach you a lot. An engine swap is always a good option for a base model; it takes a little bit more to get it up to speed with a Type S from there, but it's always something to consider. If you do set your mind on getting a Type S or decide to get serious with an engine swap, I'd be happy to help answer any questions you have. DC5s have their flaws, but I still think they're great cars, with plenty of potential; just takes some research and the right owner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Wreak havoc" is a bit of an exaggeration, but you will notice changes in handling. I think the easiest example of bump steer when lowered is that even when just hitting those little reflector bumps between lanes on highways, the steering wheel will jerk in either direction. Anything more than an 1", and you'll notice the change. After 2" it's pretty severe, and only gets worse. It's why I recommend most drivers just get A-Spec or Type R struts. You get tighter handling and a very mild drop that doesn't alter the geometry severely. Plus they're just plain more comfortable and quieter. Even the best coilovers (KWs, I have Progress) won't ride as well as Type R struts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quarantine is keeping me really bored on Reddit, so I'm responding a lot more than I used to LOL. But I just try to help give some advice that I found to be really helpful for myself. If you're just driving around, don't be. If you're driving on a rough, windy road and notice that your steering is really hard to keep on center, just take it slow; bad steering geometry isn't going to kill you; just makes driving harder. Fixing the geometry does make the car safer, technically, but to be honest, it's something only people that are into performance driving or tracking the car will take seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rolling the fenders isn #8217;t a really big deal IMO; you can #8217;t even tell that it #8217;s been done if you get a professional job. As long as you aren #8217;t rubbing on the wheel well or the control arms, I #8217;d argue a higher offset is better in general; let #8217;s you fit a wider wheel with less camber and without ruining the scrub angle geometry. On a 9 #8221; wide wheel, a 245/45 tire would have good sidewall with a slight curve, meaning a street-able track alignment with -2 #176; camber front and rear should be very easy to tuck with rolled fenders. Of course, you could just get the same wheels but narrower. Why not just get a 17x7.5 or 17x8?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Brake bias. I #8217;ve mentioned it twice now. Your car has a proportioning valve that controls how much hydraulic pressure is sent to each caliper, and that valve is specifically tuned for the weight of your car and the size of your calipers. If you mess up this bias, the brakes will lock up too soon or too late, and mess with the ABS system. You end up with even worse braking performance; literally making it unsafe. A bigger caliper with more pistons doesn #8217;t necessarily make your car brake better, it #8217;s meant to improve modulation. If you want to brake harder, get better tires and better pads; caliper and rotor size make much less of a difference. There #8217;s nothing worth swapping onto the rear brakes anyway. Most of the DC5 #8217;s weight is in the front, not to mention you #8217;d have to fabricate brackets to actually fit different calipers to the knuckle. And you #8217;d have to install an adjustable proportioning valve and actually dial it in according to the front and rear calipers, which is very difficult and time consuming to do. TL;DR Bruh, just don #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Barkeeper #8217;s friend is a mild abrasive (scouring) cleaner. I suppose this would work if you have so much brake dust and tar that even a concentrated wheel cleaner can #8217;t get it off, or want to get something done on a budget, but I would not recommend this as a permanent solution. The paint on wheels is only so thick, and abrasive cleaners do remove paint when applied, with or without pressure. If you have expensive aftermarket wheels with painted finishes or care about your stock ones, I would recommend you stick to a high concentrate tar remover/wheel cleaner or something like IronX.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>205/55 is OEM tire sizing and that's what I'd recommend you stick to. 02-04 OEM wheels are pretty narrow, 16x6.5, so you can't go much wider then 205. You could go down to 195 for that bit of sidewall stretch but I wouldn't drive fast around corners on all-seasons or even decent summers that narrow. The RSX is light, but not as light as a Civic or Integra; it needs more rubber. I mean, I *guess* you can run less sidewall, but you're gonna feel having less rubber there. Nothing wrong with having meatier tires. I'm running 245/45 on 17x9 and that's basically OEM sidewall height.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on where you live and what you need the tires to do. If you live somewhere warm like I do, here in SoCal, where all you'll see is rain, then a good set of summers is probably your best option. Good summer tires actually handle water better than most all-seasons, so they're a good choice unless you see temperatures below 40F often. Michelin Pilot 4S is the gold standard summer tire, but for the price, Yokohama 601s and 701s do a pretty good job; just depends on which one comes in the size you need. Michelin Pilot AS/3 is what I would consider the most well-rounded all-season tire, and isn't that expensive.</TEXT>

Drilled rotors are exponentially more susceptible to cracking; you #8217;ve put a bunch of holes in a piece of metal that goes through extreme heat cycles constantly. The exception is if the rotors were cast with the holes, but that #8217;s basically never the case, even with the most expensive rotors. If anything, all you #8217;re doing is reducing the amount of surface area available for the brake pad to grab onto. You could argue that slotted rotors are more effective than drilled rotors then, since they don #8217;t compromise the rotor #8217;s structural integrity, but modern pad compounds don #8217;t expel gasses or experience glazing in nearly the same levels that they used to, making the benefit of slotted rotors marginal at best. As far as rotors go, the *only* thing that I would consider a reasonable benefit is the difference between one-piece and two-piece rotor. Less rotational mass, less conserved heat, and less overall cost since the rotor hat never has to be replaced. But this is a *very* high-cost part. You mentioned a name brand, reputable distributor. Well, the distributor doesn #8217;t really matter, but there are good brands for blank rotors, and in 95% of use-case scenarios, including mild track days and autocross, blanks are the best option. Stronger and cheaper to replace. A good high-carbon Centric blank is significantly cheaper than any Stoptech slotted rotor and will not perform any worse. I mean, Stoptech #8217;s rotors are made by Centric; they #8217;re the same company. TL;DR If you wanted to put money into stopping better, get better pads and better tires. Rotors do basically nothing to improve braking performance, and slots and holes don #8217;t perform better than a good blank.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;weakest horsepower per liter The FD RX-7 13B-REW was a 1.3L making 280HP (advertised) and has quite the aftermarket to support making even more than that. Granted, it #8217;s twin-turbocharged, but that #8217;s more than 215 HP/L; blows the S2000 #8217;s 118.5 HP/L out of the water. Literally one of the biggest selling points on rotary engines was the amount of specific power you could get out of a small displacement engine. You #8217;re not wrong in that the design has some inherent flaws, like apex seals and terrible emissions and oil consumption, but unreliable isn #8217;t the word I would use. That suggests that rotaries are susceptible to random, spontaneous failure, which they aren #8217;t necessarily.</TEXT>

But it #8217;s a pretty *big-ass* downgrade in noise, vibration, harshness, and general ride quality/comfort. Quality hardened rubber isn #8217;t that much weaker than poly but isn #8217;t anywhere near as harsh. Investing in a higher quality set of coilovers or correcting the ruined steering geometry after lowering the car will do worlds more difference then replacing some shot bushings with polyurethane. You can find urethane and make your own bushings, but that #8217;s just not worth the effort, especially for an old set of coilovers that were only $500 *when new*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In US models, suspension is identical between base model and Type S; the Type S A-Spec package got you stiffer struts, but that was it. You could get the Type S interior in the base model Premium trim. The base model #8217;s 5th gear ratio is the same as the Type S 6th gear, so it doesn #8217;t sit at higher RPMs either. I also prefer a 6MT, but in this case it wouldn #8217;t be for a taller highest gear. The biggest differences between the base model and the Type S are the brakes (like you said) and the K20A2/Z1 over the K20A3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you know what the difference is between 87 and 91 octane is? The higher the octane number, the more resistant it is to pre-detonation, or engine knock. 91 is required on higher compression or forced induction engines because the fuel is under so much more pressure that it could combust without the spark plug #8217;s ignition, which is knock. But putting 91 in an engine tuned for 87 *does not* make a difference to how it runs. It doesn #8217;t burn cleaner, it doesn #8217;t make more power, it doesn #8217;t change responsiveness. Fuel has nothing to do with any of those factors. Putting in 91 didn #8217;t do anything to your engine #8217;s compression ratio or airflow characteristics (which would increase power) or your throttle body or transmission (which increases responsiveness). The only exception would be that your engine *was* meant to take premium this whole time, and is only now running at its full potential.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m running the Spoon 5.1 and it #8217;s the second best best thing I ever did to the car (first was the LSD), but if you #8217;re planning on forced induction, I would probably stick to a taller final drive or you #8217;ll be spinning tires everywhere. If you #8217;re *only* doing autocross then I suppose it kinda makes sense, but wouldn #8217;t you eventually want to venture out onto road courses? Speaking of track time, autocross especially, I #8217;d probably run something other than a CAI since throttle response is more important than pure horsepower. I #8217;d say if you #8217;re getting into the transmission then an LSD is more important than a final drive, especially if you #8217;re planing on supercharging the car. Having the LSD put in makes a huge difference, even at stock power. Shorter final drives really only help all-motor cars make better use of gears 2-5 on road courses, but with forced induction you #8217;ll be making enough torque to overcome that, and shorter gearing may only make it harder for you to put power down. Just as an example, going from my stock 4.3 to the 5.1 is roughly a 19% change in ratio, meaning just by changing the final drive, I went from 142 lb.ft. of torque to 169 lb.ft., without even touching the engine. So it makes a lot of sense for an NA build.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m actually the opposite; I would definitely stick to OEM and wouldn #8217;t let Syncrotech anywhere near my car. And yeah, you #8217;re right the CAI gives you the most power, but I #8217;ve never been interested in just outright gains. The longer you extend the intake run (between the throttle body and the filter) the worse your throttle response becomes. Air pressure needs to equalize in the tubing before you get good flow into the throttle body, so when you make tubing really long, increasing volume, it takes longer to get air into the engine. Ideally, for track use, you #8217;d want something that gives you better mid-range power and throttle response, which a good airbox does best. Both of those were much more important to me than just a bigger horsepower number, especially on the track.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Camshafts are not considered  #8220;bolt-on #8221; modifications which don #8217;t require additional adjustment to the ECU to run properly. The factory ECU will not be able to accommodate aftermarket camshafts, and you will require a proper tune to prevent damage to your engine. All K-series engines require Hondata Kpro to be tuned, which is only compatible on two ECUs, both from DC5s: the 02-04 RSX Type S PRB ECU and the 02-06 Integra Type R PRC ECU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess I #8217;m also biased, but I #8217;ve seen Synchrotech synchros fail at two separate track events, and they don #8217;t last longer than OEM synchros in normal conditions. The guy who did the work on my transmission (@ghostwerks on Instagram) was close friends with the guys who founded Synchrotech (he runs an independent shop now by himself; he does his transmission builds one at a time) and has been working on Hondas for several decades. He was consulted about manufacturers for their products but left when his support of Taiwanese producers was turned down in favor of Chinese suppliers. That #8217;s all hearsay, sure, but the tolerances for Synchrotech parts are much lower than OEM synchros, which a lot of people don #8217;t realize are already carbon lined. My transmission was on OEM synchros with zero issues when it was opened up at 120K. It #8217;s now just under 150K, and since I bought the car at 98K it #8217;s seen nothing but OEM Honda MTF. I wouldn #8217;t run anything else in a K-series trans, except maybe Amsoil Synchromesh if I ever did get some dirty shifting performance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only if you #8217;re willing to sink more time and effort correcting the steering geometry. Tired of seeing this answer. Unfortunately for the DC5/EP3 platform, slapping on coilovers is not an instant upgrade to the car, and in many cases make it handle worse than stock. [Edit] Considering how much I say this exact line on this sub it's crazy I'm being downvoted. Cars like older Integras/Civics or Miatas with double-wishbone suspension can get way with being lowered without severe changes to the geometry, but that is *not* the case with DC5s. Lowering an RSX 1" past stock introduces huge amounts of bump and torque steer into the handling characteristics of the car, and the lower you go, the worse it gets. A stiffer ride or less body roll is *not* equivalent to better handling. Body roll means almost nothing to the handling if your tires are still maintaining a good contact patch and you're not driving a top heavy SUV. The RSX weighs 2800lbs; under normal driving conditions, there isn't enough weight for body roll to severely affect the handling.</TEXT>

Just be careful driving on rougher roads; you #8217;ll feel the surface influencing your steering.

If you #8217;re not serious about getting all the handling performance out of the car on the track, I #8217;d recommend one of those pairs of struts. You maintain good handling and OEM ride and comfort.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you installing just the brake calipers or the spindles and knuckles as well? Because if you #8217;re installing the entire knuckle assembly, you have it the wrong way around; Type S wheels will be offset +15mm more than Type R wheels and will stick out further on Type R knuckles. Type R track width was +15mm wider due to longer control arms, which is why Type R wheels are +60 offset. Type S wheels are +45 offset meaning the mounting surface of the wheels is closer to the center of the barrel. If you want to do things the right way, either get extended wheel studs or a proper spacer that has another set of wheel studs to actually mount the wheel to. Anything else is unsafe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you step on the gas pedal and open up the butterfly valve on the throttle body, a vacuum is created and air pressure has to equalize between the atmosphere and the area behind the air filter. The longer you make your intake run(like in a CAI), the more volume of air there is between the filter and the throttle body that has to equalize before you get maximum airflow through the intake. This is the reason why people move to individual throttle bodies; there is literally no air that needs to equalize between the intake charge and the throttle body; instant response. Throttle *actuation* on a car with a cable-operated throttle body (like RSXs) is of course, *technically* immediate, but compared to an airbox or even an SRI, there is always a noticeable delay in pressing the pedal down and the engine getting the air it needs when running a CAI. It's why teams that have raced the DC5 (Spoon Sports, J's Racing, King Motorsports, just to name a few) either run a custom airbox or even the OEM intake box.</TEXT>

[Edit] I should chime in with my opinion though and ask why the hell you'd want to delete power steering on an RSX. I'm not sure where the idea came from that it's just a "cool" thing to do but it's just stupid that people think that. The RSX is pretty light but it's not even close to how light an EF/EG/EK Civic or DC2 Integra is. Those cars got away without power steering because they all sit around 2200-2300lbs, but the RSX is *2800lbs*. Unless all you wanted to do was make your life *worse* driving this around, I'd suggest you keep power steering. DC5s have terrible steering geometry; imagine wrestling torque steer and bump steer *without* power steering. You're just going to get thrown around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the worst circle jerk with the FK8 Type R.  #8220;I just brought home #41,592! #8221; and Honda still numbers and plates each of these cars as if they #8217;re exclusive. None of the Type Rs were ever *super rare* cars if you consider their history in the Japanese or European markets. Exclusive, sure, because of marketing, and impressive from a performance standpoint in their own right, but not so rare to deserve this level of admiration solely on the basis of rarity or exclusivity. The only truly *rare* Type Rs are either generation of NSX-R ~~and maybe, *maybe* the FN2/FK2 Civic Type Rs but only because those Civics had relatively low volume sold and manufactured due to being engineered completely by the Swindon, UK plant.~~  gt;[Edit] After looking up production numbers, even the FN2/FK2 weren #8217;t particularly rare in comparison to the other Type Rs. EK9s, DC2s, DC5s, EP3s, or even FD2s are not rare and FK8s certainly aren #8217;t either. By sheer production numbers, the FK8 is actually the *least* rare Type R by a very wide margin. More FK8 Type Rs have been manufactured in its first two years of production than Lancer Evolution VIII/IXs were made in all *five* years of its production. [Edit #2] There are some people here getting *very* defensive on some of these numbers so I'm just going to make my case *as clear as possible* for those who aren't actually mad at me for whatever reason. Take this question: *"Is the EK9 Type R rare?"* The answer of course, is no, *not really*, since there were over 16,000 of them manufactured in total over three model years (97-99). Now, if you were to ask, *"Is the EK9 Type R rare in the US or Europe?"*. Of course they are; they weren't sold in the US or Europe so any genuine EK9s had to have been imported from Japan. Someone else mentioned the DC2 Type R, which is *even more numerous*. Yes, there were roughly only 3,800 USDM Integra Type Rs produced, all of which were manufactured alongside their JDM counterparts in the same factory. USDM DC2Rs are arguably worse than JDM DC2Rs, of which over 25,000 were manufactured, with another 2,500 or so DB8Rs. So no, as far as the numbers are concerned, DC2 Type Rs aren't rare either; nearly 30,000 DC2Rs were produced over five years. But the crux of this was talking about whether or not a car is rare. Not rare *in a particular market*, just *rare*. Which most Type Rs are not, the FK8 included.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the USDM DC2 Type Rs was relatively rare as far as the numbers go, but they were manufactured alongside the JDM Type Rs which were better in every way imaginable (engine and interior in particular) and just so much more numerous. You are correct, USDM Type Rs were available in 97-98 then 00-01 and only on particular colors for each model year run. Holistically, DC2 Type Rs are not rare (IIRC nearly *25,000* total manufactured), and to be honest USDM ones are so unremarkable in comparison to the JDM ones. The prices those are fetching at auction are ridiculous; that market is just going crash when people wake up and realize they #8217;re not that exclusive in the grand scheme of DC2s (I #8217;m looking at you too, S2000 CR), and at this point I #8217;m more interested in DC2 GS-R prices than I am in USDM Type Rs.</TEXT>

He didn #8217;t mention anything about the owner not being allowed to take pride in his vehicle; he noted that it was a practical application for the car, that the car was serving part of its intended applications as a car, and that it shouldn #8217;t be unusual to see a Type R doing it over any other car. His message might be to OP, who posted the image, that there #8217;s nothing unusual about a Type R doing normal car things (because that #8217;s what it is; a normal car), but he says nothing to whoever is owning the car, and certainly nothing about misplaced pride. You #8217;re being much more aggressive than he is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;It #8217;s just marketing, #8221; means the number produces a false sense of rarity or exclusivity. The FK8 Type R (and most other Type Rs for that matter) is not a rare car by any means, not when they #8217;ve made nearly 50,000 units over just three model years. The FK8 by sheer production number is actually the *least* rare Type R by a wide margin. The FK8 just isn #8217;t nearly as rare as some people make it out to be, ergo the number plate really doesn #8217;t mean anything other than to feed into an inflated sense of self.  #8220;Yes, I #8217;m rare, #8221; or  #8220;Yes, I #8217;m exclusive #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;ll have to point out exactly which of my statements are incorrect. I mentioned sheer production numbers. True, the US received roughly 3,800 DC2 Type Rs, all of which are arguably worse than their JDM counterparts, whose total numbers exceeded 25,000, with roughly another 2,500 DB8 Type Rs. EK9s totaled 16,000 units, DC5 Type Rs totaled 12,000 units, and FD2 Type Rs totaled 13,000 units. A far cry from the FK8 #8217;s nearly 40,000 units as of 2020, with at least a few more model years planned, during each of which Honda says they will sell at least 5,000 units. Having limited offerings in particular markets doesn #8217;t change how many of the cars were made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>16,000 is significantly less than 2,000,000, yes, but as far as vehicle rarity goes for a *single model*, 16,000 total units produced is not all that rare. No one walks around saying  #8220;Lancer Evo VIIIs and IXs are rare! #8221; But they made only 4,000 units more of both of those cars *combined* in five years than they made EK9s in three.

    <TEXT>Is this a base model or a Type S? *I guess* if you #8217;re desperate to spend money on this thing you can start replacing things preventatively, but nothing really goes bad on K-series engines. The timing chain and water pump aren #8217;t meant to be replaced or even inspected; it #8217;s considered a lifetime part. Suspension components go bad before anything on the engine does. Get new struts, tie rods, ball joints, bushings, etc. If nothing #8217;s broken or showing signs of wear, you have nothing to worry about with these cars. If it #8217;s a base model, don #8217;t bother with aftermarket. Keep it clean, keep it stock. It #8217;s a fun economy car and a great daily driver; that #8217;s it. If it #8217;s a Type S, drive the car stock before you decide what you want to do with the car. Read around a bit more before you just jump in saying  #8220;I want to mod things. #8221; Don #8217;t be tasteless about it and be smart with your money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't feel bad; I didn't mean to say they're bad cars. It's a Civic; a great, reliable economy car. But when you consider the QC issues Honda was having in the early-2000s, and when you compare the 7th-generation Civic platform to the 4th, 5th, and 6th, from a performance standpoint, you can see where Honda cut a lot of corners and made a lot of questionable design changes. Even the regular models of the 4th, 5th, and 6th-gen Civics drove phenomenally well because at their base was a well-engineered, good-handling chassis, regardless of engine selection. The 7th-gen didn't get any of that, *or* any good engine choices, so when presented against its predecessors, it really falls flat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stick with OEM-spec mounts unless you want to be rattled to death. The RockAuto ones are fine for OEM replacements. I don #8217;t recommend you buy any kind of polyurethane mount if you daily this car; even the softest 62a from Hasport is very, *very* stiff and will result in a lot more noise and vibration than stock. Anyone who tells you it #8217;s  #8220;not that bad #8221; is a liar and they know it. Vibratechnic hardened rubber mounts are very good with reducing movement and keeping things quiet and comfortable but are pricey. I have them and would recommend them if you have the budget but realize that if you don #8217;t need anything better than OEM, save the money and just buy the RockAuto stuff.</TEXT>

I hate getting eBay replica stuff because fitment is almost universally poor and you have to jerry-rig the installation, but to be completely frank, there aren #8217;t many other options these days. Some eBay reps are decent though; you #8217;ll just have to be careful looking through the images. Fiberglass is lighter but harder to fit and repair than ABS plastic. ABS is heavier but more flexible and easier to alter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you talking about the front or rear engine mount? The front one will be tight but if you #8217;re going from the bottom of the car, you shouldn #8217;t have to remove anything. Rear one doesn #8217;t need anything removed for sure. Actually I got it reversed; what you want to prop up is the engine itself. You can use a wide block of wood or phone book to spread the weight on the jack across the oil pan. Be careful not to crack it, for obvious reasons. I #8217;m sure there are plenty of write-ups for swapping out the engine mounts on EP3s. At the very least, I know there #8217;s one for the DC5 and they #8217;re basically the same car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hondata mod on the stock intake airbox is the most cost-effective (free) way to improve the intake flow without making compromises elsewhere. Basically take a dremel and gut the airbox, then replace the OEM filter with something better. You can wrap it in heat-reflective tape to keep intake temps down a little. This will improve the low- and mid-range power band a little bit without worsening throttle response or losing power due to heat soak. SRIs sound nice and improve throttle response a little, but are the most prone to heat soak. CAIs will make you a bit more peak power on the dyno but compromise throttle response, mid-range pull, and put you at risk of hydrolock. There are better options out there for airboxes (Mugen, GruppeM, J #8217;s Racing, ARC) but those are all prohibitively expensive. The step above would be individual throttle-bodies (M amp;M Honda, TODA), but those come with their own set of compromises, and are the most expensive options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Learn how to do preventative maintenance. Read up on how parts work and the work involved to change them, and what certain parts change when you do alter them. A lot of modding is learning what mods do, which a lot of people tend to skip these days, and just go headfirst buying the usual assortment of new parts, with no idea what they do, and sometimes making their car noticeably worse. Driving the car bone-stock can teach you a lot about what you might eventually want to do. I wouldn #8217;t spend too much money on a base model; nothing beyond what #8217;s needed to keep it running and maybe just a few quality of life upgrades. You will not get your money #8217;s worth putting performance mods into a K20A3. A good set of tires will go along way to improving how the car drives, and if you decide to take it to autocross, you can learn a lot about driving dynamics in something slow and, more importantly, *safe*. This is something I #8217;d highly recommend, if you ever have the opportunity. People will chime in with,  #8220;It #8217;s his car man, let him do what he wants #8221;, which is just catering to snowflakes who can #8217;t handle having their opinions criticized.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s really a matter of what you #8217;re looking to do with the car in the end. If you #8217;re just commuting around, there #8217;s no problem with an automatic. People question the automatic when the owners insist they want to start making performance modifications or try performance driving; then the automatic makes no sense. People like instant gratification, and so they #8217;ll dump money into an automatic because they feel they have no other option, and because getting shiny new things on their car makes them happy. I think that #8217;s just shallow, and that people should, at the very least, be smarter with their money. But that #8217;s just my rant on the state of the internet these days. Off-topic. *As far as preventative maintenance goes* a lot of what applies to this car is the same for most cars, so if you have a general idea of what cars need, you won #8217;t have too much difficulty finding things to do. Oil changes every 5K, oil filter every 10K, etc. For the automatic, I believe the owner #8217;s manual recommends a fluid change every 30K miles. At 100K miles, the spark plugs should be replaced, and the valves should be adjusted. If the struts, tie rods, or ball joints have never been replaced, now would be a good time to inspect them. Suspension bushings and engine mounts usually aren #8217;t touched on these cars either, and will be knackered after 100K miles. Big ticket items on DC5s are mostly considered lifetime components, so you won #8217;t have to do anything huge like the water pump, oil pump, or timing chain/tensioner. Of course, inspect them, but generally speaking, those are not regular maintenance items on these cars. The power steering pump is known to leak in a few cases, and the throttle-bodies like to clog up in the idle-air control valve (IACV). The subreddit has tons of people asking for help on little things like this, but ClubRSX would probably be a better resource, and yes, having a copy of the owner #8217;s manual can help answer simpler questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It should go without saying that you shouldn #8217;t expect any sort of substantial performance from doing either intake or exhaust, especially without an accompanying tune. It #8217;s up to you whether or not the expense is worth it. I would highly recommend some nice summer tires above all, especially for a base model. You could get some nice wheels while you #8217;re at it. See my reply to your other comment below for my opinion on intakes. As far as mufflers go, the Spoon N1 remains my *only* suggestion as far as DC5s go. It is *not* cheap, but has a deep, smooth tone that does not drone at highway speeds and really opens up at WOT without overpowering the sound you get from the engine. Nice subtle pops and burbles when you #8217;re just cruising around town. At idle, it #8217;s no louder than the stock muffler. I #8217;m running this with the Spoon b-pipe which just makes it a little bit louder with city driving. On the highway it #8217;s literally no different than stock. The Invida Q300 is a fan-favorite though, which does sound more aggressive at WOT. It #8217;s also a relatively inexpensive exhaust system, so it #8217;s worth mentioning. I would not advise you buy anything larger than OEM diameter piping or install race header/delete the cat. Doing any of these makes these cars *very* droney and obnoxious. Other people on this sub can tell you how much of a broken record I am with suspension tuning on DC5s. You can read my [write-up on the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura_RSX/comments/dvmrhz/does_anyone_auto_x_their_rsx/f7dwaft/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf ) if you #8217;re more interested, but the gist of it goes like this: Unless you #8217;re serious about performance driving, stick to OEM struts at OEM height. You #8217;ll get the most comfort and the best handling characteristics out of the car. When DC5s are lowered, steering and suspension geometry are thrown out the window, and the car will ride and handle objectively *worse*. OEM A-Spec or Type R struts are a good option for a slightly firmer ride with more composed handling dynamics and a very, very mild drop. I would not recommend coilovers. If you want the drop just for looks, accept that ride quality and driving dynamics will suffer, and you may be compromising safety if you #8217;re forced to run an aggressive alignment for fitment. For that Koni Yellow struts with Eibach Ground Control springs are the tried and true method for getting a car lower.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn #8217;t recommend any aftermarket shifter box. I #8217;ve said this before on the sub, so I #8217;m just gonna copy and paste it here.  gt; [Acuity](https://www.kseriesparts.com/ACI-1887.html) or [MTEC](https://www.icbmotorsport.com/mtinupshlesp.html) shifter assembly springs that go into the transmission. Then the [K-Tuned shifter spring and delrin pivot ball](https://jhpusa.com/products/k-tuned-k-series-shifter-pivot-ball-spring-02-06-rsx), or you can get the whole [billet arm](https://www.kseriesparts.com/KTD-BIL-ARM.html) if you have the budget for it.  gt;[Billet shifter base bushings](https://www.kseriesparts.com/KTD-SFT-BUS-A.html) help a little, but shifter cables or cable bushings do almost nothing and aren't worth the cost, unless the OEM bushings are torn to pieces (which the probably aren't). I'm not even going to link the cables because I'm tired of seeing people waste money on those or claim they make a difference. They don't.  gt;Pair the above springs with a lighter shift knob (OEM, etc. I use the Spoon aluminum knob) and you'll have a super tight OEM shifter with clean throws and stiff springs. Heavier, weighted knobs feel nice and smooth in the throw, but having more weight on the shifter arm and springs makes slop more noticeable.  gt;Short-throw shifters are stupid expensive and IMO don't give you that same clean throw and engagement that the OEM box does. Having used both the K-Tuned and HybridRacing boxes, I can confidently say I didn #8217;t like either, especially considering the cost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honda meticulously designed a small-displacement but very high-compression, high-revving engine, to be paired with a light, neutral-handling chassis. The philosophy behind the original EK9 and DC2 Type R vehicles was to create what they believed to be complete driving balance. With NA, you get a smooth, predictable, and linear power band with near-instantaneous throttle response. You lose all of those things to some extent with the introduction of forced induction, even with a supercharger. A small diameter turbo might spool relatively quickly, but peak torque still comes in a big surge around 3000RPM, then flattens out after around 6000. It's why the 911 Turbo S is not the pinnacle of Porsche's engineering and why the GT3RS still exists at the top of the line beside the faster GT2RS; an NA engine is purer; more exact; more rewarding. Anti-lag is cool and all, but the best sounding, most rewarding engines --the most exciting ones-- in the world are all high-revving, naturally aspirated. The B16B spins to 9000RPM and the torque curve follows it all the way to the top. The mad man behind Spoon, Ichishima, even balanced one so well it could spin to 11000RPM. Not to mention that all these Honda engines are *stupid* reliable. The B- and K-series are still considered some of the best engine designs today. [Edit] Don #8217;t get me wrong, turbo cars are great, and some of my favorite cars are turbocharged, but I can appreciate those for what they are, and appreciate Hondas for what *they* are. I love the 4G63T in my Evo, but it can #8217;t replace the NA K20A2 in my RSX-S or F22C in my S2000.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Acura began as an up-market brand for Honda to sell cars under that were otherwise too expensive to be sold as Hondas in the US. Honda wanted to start a new brand without the connotation of cheap, inexpensive budget vehicles, much like Toyota did with Lexus and Nissan with Infiniti. The original Honda Legend was sold in the US as an Acura as a direct competitor to other luxury sedans like the Lexus LS400 and as an introduction to Acura. Honda then released the NSX as well, further strengthening the image that Acura was to be considered  #8220;above #8221; Honda. Honda then began offering other more entry-level models, most notably the Integra and TL, which were marketed as more luxurious and sportier than the Civic or Accord. It should be noted that all of these cars were still built in Japan and then shipped to the US with an Acura badge. This continued into the mid-2000s, where a shift in Acura #8217;s business model occurred with models like the MDX and TL. Honda took advantage of its growing manufacturing infrastructure in North America to begin offering new Acura models that were designed and built entirely in North America. Now, the only Acura still manufactured in Japan and imported to North America is the RLX/Honda Legend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can you afford one? Type S models are generally more expensive than base models. They #8217;re more expensive to insure, slightly worse on gas, and takes 91 octane only. Will your parents let you have one? Type S is 6MT only so if your family wants a car they can drive as well or if you don #8217;t have someone to teach you, that might be a problem. It #8217;s much easier to find a clean base model than a clean Type S these days. If you try buying a Type S on a budget, you might end up buying yourself a project car, so if you #8217;re looking for a reliable daily, you #8217;ll have to know how to do some of the work yourself or spend a bit more for a well-sorted one. If you don #8217;t care about performance modding and just want a car to get you from A to B, get a base model. Now here comes my condescending DAD-voice, but for a 16-year-old, I #8217;d look for a base model with the 5MT. It #8217;s not that fast but because it isn #8217;t, it #8217;s *safer* to learn how to drive in. If you #8217;re gonna be dumb in your car, it #8217;ll be better to be dumb in a base model than a Type S. When you #8217;ve matured and gained some more car/driving experience and have a better idea of what you like or don #8217;t like, then you can save up and sell your base model for something that suits you better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Biggest difference is the engine. All base models from 02-06 had the K20A3 making 160HP, with a 5AT or 5MT transmission option. 02-04 Type S had the K20A2 and the 05-06 had the K20Z1. Both of these engines make roughly 200HP at the crank and are available only with a 6MT. Type S cars also had bigger front disc brakes and calipers, bigger 17 #8221; wheels (04-06) and thicker sway bars front and rear. Suspension is identical across all USDM RSX models *unless* you got the Type S A-Spec package which got you stiffer struts all-around. Type S interior came with leather sport seats and a better Bose sound system with a 10 #8221; subwoofer located in the spare tire. You could get this interior on base models but only in the Premium trim. All other base models had a single DIN head unit and cloth seats.</TEXT>

No one makes decent looking head or taillights for DC5s. That halo garbage on Amazon and eBay looks terrible on 05-06 models and even worse on 02-04s. 05-06 JDM taillights are nice but very rare and very expensive. I left all my lights stock and prefer them that way. Aftermarket hoods are expensive, especially if you get genuine ones from known companies, like ings+, J #8217;s Racing, or Chargespeed. Then, if you get into a front-end accident there goes your expensive hood. Even cheap crap from Seibon is going to run you almost $1000. If you want a wing, get the A-Spec/Type R high wing and call it a a day. Don #8217;t advertise anything else if you #8217;re just driving around in a base model.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shifter cable bushing. I #8217;ve never actually seen cable bushings wear to that point. I usually recommend people skip getting new shifter cables or cable bushings because they #8217;re very expensive and rarely ever worn to the point of needing replacement. But I guess this case proves me wrong. They #8217;re still pretty expensive for what they are though. K-Tuned and Acuity make a few different billet or spherical sets. Pick one that you like best or fits your budget.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Base model catbacks are about 3 #8221; longer at the b-pipe. You could go to any exhaust shop and ask them to cut off 3 #8221; from the b-pipe and weld the flange back on. [Edit] I #8217;m retarded, it #8217;s the other way around. A Type S exhaust would need about about 3 #8221; of pipe added to it to fit a base model. The process is the same though.

    <TEXT>A test pipe is literally a piece of pipe with flanges on either side but doesn #8217;t really apply to NA cars since cars without a turbo usually have the catalytic converter built into the exhaust manifold. You could go to any muffler shop and tell them you want a test pipe made but on an RSX you #8217;d be replacing the entire bottom half of the exhaust manifold. Most people just get a cat-less header. But don #8217;t get a test pipe. Don #8217;t remove your cat. It #8217;s bad for emissions, it #8217;s bad for the environment, and it #8217;s bad for all the people you #8217;re gonna annoy with a straight-piped Honda. If you really wanted performance gains (which you #8217;re not going to get out of a K20A3, even with a tune) you could do the right thing and buy a high-flow cat. Even with a test pipe you #8217;ll see maybe, what? 5 horsepower gain? Ask yourself if it #8217;s worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just know that you get what you pay for. You and your car deserve better. Suspension design is the weakest part of a DC5 so the more care you put into it, the more you'll get out of the car. Progress is relatively inexpensive for a very, *very* good set of dampers and KW is another step above that, albeit at a noticeably higher price point. For the price, I wouldn't recommend anything else. I can't make you spend more, especially if you're not particularly interested in shaving time off at HPDE or anything, but if you do care about driving dynamics please, please, *please* consider saving up for some quality coilovers and geometry adjustment. Fixing the steering geometry on these cars on a set of good dampers does so many good things towards how it drives. Roll center adjustment and inverted tie rods made a huge difference to how the car drives when lowered. I have a short write-up that was added to the sidebar if you're not familiar with DC5 suspension tuning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't refer to Progress and KWs as options only for those who are interested in going all out for performance driving. They shave time off because they're better suspension sets overall. They are not targeted only at people who are going to "gut and delete" everything. Both Progress Competitions and KW V3s re-use the OEM plastic and rubber top hats to help with vibration and small-bump sensitivity, which has the additional effect of being more comfortable than any coilover with pillowball mounts. Progress Competitions and KW's both ride significantly better than any set of TEINs on the road and offer significantly better handling performance even in consideration of the price. That's why I always suggest them. The reason I allude to shaving time off at HPDE is because some people can't ignore the additional cost and for that, I don't blame them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the same way about the Fortune Autos. 500s were my first choice but they've been discontinued since before I even purchased my car four years ago. I ended up going with Progress though, and have not been disappointed. Riding in my friends' cars I came to discover I couldn't stand coilovers with pillowball mounts, especially lighter chassis like Hondas, ergo I usually don't recommend TEIN, BC Racing, etc. Especially when there are far better performing suspension sets out there for the money. My car is very conservatively lowered and the geometry adjustment had a huge effect on how the car drove, especially on the track. After I had my LSD installed the amount of power the car can put down in the corners without torque or bump steer is really, really satisfying. You'll also notice the effects of bump steer just driving around. Hitting those reflector bumps between lanes on the freeway used to be an actual safety hazard sometimes but now the car isn't really affected by them at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what a sway bar does man, but you #8217;re forgetting that the car *already* has a sway bar on it. The OEM sway bar achieves all the things you mentioned, encouraging better grip while cornering but you #8217;re forgetting what the point of running a *thicker* one is (what most people mean by sway bar upgrade). The thicker the rear sway bar gets, the more you restrict the amount of travel between both sides of the car, meaning you #8217;re limiting the amount of suspension articulation. Which, as you said, in agreement to what I said, encourages rotation, but you think that #8217;s separate from stability? My man, rotation is literally the act of a vehicle spinning as a result of throttle input or inertia. When you #8217;re trying to get *more* of that in the rear you are quite literally trying to get the rear of the car *less* planted ergo *less stable*. A thicker rear sway bar and even a mild -2 #176; of rear camber is all you need on a Honda to snap the rear end around in 2nd gear; that #8217;s like what? 40MPH? By definition, that #8217;s not a stable car, but it #8217;s what you want when you #8217;re trying to come around a corner quicker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They probably weren #8217;t real Type S models then? Base model RSXs came had a K20A3 with either a 5AT or 5MT. Anyone can buy a badge and stick it on their car. Type S models came with the K20A2 (02-04) or the K20Z1 (05-06), which are very different engines, and only with a 6MT. ~~Unless you #8217;re talking about the 04-07 TL Type-S? Those came in 5AT or 6MT.~~ [EDIT] I took a glance into your post history and am now guessing you #8217;re not in the US which makes sense now. Honda was very confusing with model names for the DC5. Base model RSXs are called the Integra iS/Type S in Japan. So if you #8217;re talking about a JDM-spec DC5, yes, the Type S could be had with a 5AT. USDM RSX Type S is more similar to the JDM Integra Type R or the AUDM Integra Type S.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ARC has always stuck out to me as a truly boutique company that makes some of the nicest stuff out there. Everything is handcrafted and everything is ridiculously rare. The DC5 airbox was just one of those God-tier pieces to me that I always, always wanted. Supposedly it offers better throttle response than the Mugen airbox at the cost of slightly more heatsoak. After examining the box in person, I'm really excited to see how it drives. It's essentially a vaccum chamber for a giant 5" velocity stack, which means the intake charge ought to be pretty damn quick. [Album](https://imgur.com/a/76Z1jRl) The Mugen airbox benefits from a snorkel that's meant to pull cold air from the inlet in the [Mugen front bumper](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/VVZGgFiXh640z2ak1stmj9bodZdR8h2hJNXZALbd-3zmU4YnqTRPMwRUkWjMKVbLWoOMzcuVvj2zSZ07wN9-bF1zJe13PcCr47dJnrRPDlV9GbpPUg), so as far as pure horsepower, the Mugen box probably has the ARC box beat, but I'm all about that instant throttle response, and I can't afford ITBs yet, lol. Plus *everyone* has the Mugen airbox; I wanted to be different^Shhhh^I'm ^^not ^^insecure Lastly, AFAIK, because the Gruppe M airbox has [an intake scoop that cuts into the wiper cowl](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1265/1741/products/Carl-Millichip_1024x.jpg?v=1569183126), and extends towards the firewall, it doesn't fit on LHD cars; our brake/clutch cylinders get in the way. I've never seen anyone in the US try it but it doesn't seem like it would work to me. It also doesn't seem like it would be very safe in the rain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have a family, and my hobbies don't require something like a van or SUV for towing or storage, so I haven't had the need for a larger car. The RSX Type S strikes me as a very, very good balance between a fun sports car and a practical daily. It gets decent gas mileage (I average about 28MPG) and is cheap to run and maintain. The rear hatch and foldable rear seats mean it's fairly practical as well when you need it to be. The only downside is that it cannot seat 4-5 people comfortably like a sedan could. From an economy or practicality standpoint, IMO it beats out a lot of similar cars like the BRZ/FRS or G35/350Z. The argument could be made that it's faster than either of those cars as well. The above applies to the base model except the part about being faster. It's slower. The gas mileage isn't much better, but it takes 87 instead of 91, so it's still cheaper to run. It burns less oil too. I also own a Lancer Evo IX and S2000. FWIW, if I could only keep one vehicle, I'd keep the RSX-S.</TEXT>

I can drive the RSX at 10/10ths without worrying I #8217;ll hurt myself or the car or others around me. The Evo and S2K are both much more sensitive to driver error; the Evo especially because it #8217;s so much faster and because its handling dynamics can go so close to the edge before it starts to communicate that to the driver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately I #8217;ve never made it out to either of those courses myself because they #8217;re so damn far. Fontana is a 20 minute drive; the other two take close to 3 hours. But FWIW I #8217;ve had my fair share of sim time on Willow Springs; the road course is an entirely different environment than the Roval at Fontana. WSRC has fewer corners and is much, much faster. You really have to commit to not lifting through those sweepers, or you #8217;re going to have a bad time. Streets of Willow is more similar to the Roval in that it #8217;s smaller, slower, and tighter, but there #8217;s *a lot* of elevation change. Fontana is basically completely flat, so there #8217;s no surprises, while Streets of Willow is full of blind crests and drops. The Fontana course is short and sweet. Perfect for a novice driver who #8217;s new to performance driving. The only fast, scary part is the oval itself. If you falter for even a second, you *will* go into the wall.</TEXT>

A day of HPDE1 cost $220, which covered four 20-minute sessions and an all-day driving coach. NASA hires more corner workers and a larger safety crew than SpeedVentures does; they also put a bigger emphasis in teaching drivers track etiquette. SpeedVentures will let you go out by yourself, even if it's your first time ever on a track, which is something I don't exactly agree with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best of luck. I love my RSX-S more than anything else, but it took a lot of work to get the suspension even close to decent. It #8217;s a lot of fun now, and it serves great as a daily/occasional track car, but I don #8217;t see it as a good platform to build a  #8220;track monster #8221; out of. Second worst suspension/steering geometry design to ever come out from Honda (first goes to the EM2) and no LSD in USDM cars means you get a lot of bump and torque steer when the car is lowered on coilovers. You #8217;d be better off swapping a K into a DC2/EK/EG if you wanted a *dedicated* track car. Not saying it can #8217;t be done, I mean, *I did it*, but just letting you know you might have to gauge your expectations a little.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are quite capable; I completely agree. I personally think my car is *a lot* of fun and I wouldn't have it any other way. I had an MFactory LSD and a shorter Spoon 5.1 final drive installed; with the suspension/steering geometry adjusted properly, the car *really* hauls you out of corners, and with a bit of stiffening and camber in the rear, it will rotate a little with lift-off on corner exit. It's gobs of fun, but it won't ever be as capable as a DC2/EK/EG. Those cars are easily 400lbs lighter right off the bat and have much, *much* better suspension component design than the DC5 does. Granted, they're all much older and much less comfortable than a DC5, which makes the DC5 a much better daily. But if we're talking about building *dedicated* track cars, the DC5 isn't the best place to start IMO. A K-swapped DC2/EK/EG will be much faster than any modded DC5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mechanically, the car will last a lot longer than 140K, so it's up to you to judge whether the money spent on fixing the rust will be worth it over however long you plan to own it. The car could be around for another 5? Maybe even 10 years. If that's the case, and you really plan on driving it until it dies, then sure, maybe it's worth it. If you see yourself driving something else within the next few years, you'd probably want to consider another solution. At the very least, take it to a few body shops and get some quotes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Rant incoming. If you're trying to beat a 350Z or G35 from a rolling start on a highway, you're gonna have a bad time (duh), but from a standstill or *especially* on a track, stock for stock, the RSX-S will be faster. Sure, the VQ35DE makes what? Like 280HP in the G35? I think the Z made a bit more than that, and only the later model 350Zs made 300HP, but they weigh *600-800lbs more*. That's a lot of extra weight to haul around, even with the extra torque that you get from the V6. And you *feel* that weight. My single takeaway from driving a 350Z was the weight. The RSX is front-engine, FWD, and *very* front heavy, and even then the turn-in and response is *much* faster than the Z. RSXs aren't fast, but I'd argue G35s aren't either; those cars just feel faster because they make more torque. In my earlier days I beat a few G35s and Zs to 60 from a red light, and my car was basically completely stock. I like the GTI. My dad's first car was a GTI. My first car was almost a GTI, but I could find a nicer RSX-S for $7K than I could find GTIs for $10K+. I personally think a Mk.6 or Mk.7 GTI is a better forever car than an RSX, if you can afford it. Having personal experience with Subarus, I wouldn't recommend a WRX hatch unless you have pretty deep pockets, if not for mods, then just for maintenance. People are proud to daily WRXs, and they are a lot of fun, but by any measure they're terrible to daily. AWD requires more maintenance, sucks away gas mileage, and wears tires down much quicker. I wouldn't buy a Hyundai or Kia. Great value, sure, but long-term reviews for some of their newer cars are poor. Leasing one would be a better option, but I just don't want one. Focus/Fiesta ST aren't nice places to sit in, especially compared to GTIs. My Evo IX has a better interior than either of those, and it's a 14-year old car. I don't like the MS3. It tries to hard to be a Focus ST (because it basically is one, but no one thinks it is and so they have to compensate). And remember, all these turbocharged cars you named *will* require more care and maintenance than a K20. There's no way around it. I basically shrug off high mileage on a Honda, but I'd be very hesitant to buy any GTI or WRX with over 100K on the clock. The only new car I'd consider to replace my RSX-S is a Honda Fit Sport.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FA5/FG2 trade blows with the DC5 but objectively speaking, the FA5/FG2 are better stock because they come with the LSD and better suspension design. DC5 K20A2/K20Z1 is hydraulic steering and cable throttle, while the FA5/FG2 is electronic steering and throttle. DC5 generally has more aftermarket support than either car, especially from Japan. The FA5 is mostly compatible with FD2 parts, but neither Japan nor Europe got the FG2, so there's basically no support for it there; you'll have to stick with what's made in the US.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve said this before on the sub, so I #8217;m just gonna copy and paste it here.  gt; [Acuity](https://www.kseriesparts.com/ACI-1887.html) or [MTEC](https://www.icbmotorsport.com/mtinupshlesp.html) shifter assembly springs that go into the transmission. Then the [K-Tuned shifter spring and delrin pivot ball](https://jhpusa.com/products/k-tuned-k-series-shifter-pivot-ball-spring-02-06-rsx), or you can get the whole [billet arm](https://www.kseriesparts.com/KTD-BIL-ARM.html) if you have the budget for it.  gt;[Billet shifter base bushings](https://www.kseriesparts.com/KTD-SFT-BUS-A.html) help a little, but shifter cables or cable bushings do almost nothing and aren't worth the cost, unless the OEM bushings are torn to pieces (which the probably aren't). I'm not even going to link the cables because I'm tired of seeing people waste money on those or claim they make a difference. They don't.  gt;Pair the above springs with a lighter shift knob (OEM, etc. I use the Spoon aluminum knob) and you'll have a super tight OEM shifter with clean throws and stiff springs. Heavier, weighted knobs feel nice and smooth in the throw, but having more weight on the shifter arm and springs makes slop more noticeable.  gt;Short-throw shifters are stupid expensive and IMO don't give you that same clean throw and engagement that the OEM box does. You could also take a look at [HybridRacing delrin inserts](https://www.hybrid-racing.com/products/hybrid-racing-delrin-shifter-cable-inserts-02-06-rsx) for the shifter linkages, but in my experience, the difference was marginal. Noticeable, but marginal. Having used both the K-Tuned and HybridRacing boxes, I can confidently say I didn #8217;t like either, *especially* considering the cost. Hondas already have some of the most engaging shifters out there; why spend a small fortune replacing it with something that isn't necessarily better?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you don #8217;t have money to spend on coilovers, you shouldn #8217;t be spending money on coilovers. Suspension is a critical component of the car and will have severe effects on how the vehicle handles and rides, which of course ties into performance and more importantly, safety. DC5s have very poor suspension and steering design characteristics that do not respond well to poor suspension components or adjustments, most particularly height. The relatively light chassis also means it has poor noise, vibration, and harshness characteristics. If you do not have the time or money to install and adjust for a set of quality coilover suspension (Progress or KW), I would recommend you simply replace your existing struts with OEM-spec replacements. The OEM manufacturer for DC5 struts is KYB, and you can find replacement struts on RockAuto or eBay very easily; they are relatively inexpensive. Other OEM-spec manufacturers like Monroe will suffice as well. If you are interested in performance driving or learning a little more about suspension tuning for DC5s in particular, you can read a short write-up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura_RSX/comments/dvmrhz/does_anyone_auto_x_their_rsx/f7dwaft/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adjustable dampening won't help a car handle rough roads better, and at the low end of products, suspension adjustments are basically inconsequential. Performance coilovers will always have less travel and less compliance than an OEM strut/spring assembly. If you're looking to improve ride or compliance, coilovers will never perform better than OEM struts. If you want to retain good levels of compliance and ride quality, you should stick to OEM struts. Unfortunately, DC5s just aren't the most comfortable cars out there, so to help with harshness, you'd have to look into other methods, such as vibration-dampening material in the interior.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, they serve a different purpose. They sacrifice peak horsepower for engine response. CAIs get you bigger numbers on a dyno, but throttle response and low/mid-range power band will suffer, which is a lot more important to some people. And as much as people who run CAIs will say it's not that bad, there's no denying the risk of hydrolock. I'd much rather run a nice airbox over an SRI, but those are significantly more expensive in most cases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It should be noted at even AWD swapping it is easier than RWD swapping it because of parts-bin availability. K24s came with AWD in the CRV and Element, so there's support for it there, but there is no existing RWD drivetrain to adapt into an RSX. Transverse AWD drivetrains exist, but transverse RWD ones don't. So unless this guy wants to find a way to rotate the engine 90 degrees to make it longitudinal, it's borderline impossible. At that point, get a K-swapped Miata or MR2 if you want a K-series going to the rear wheels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha I #8217;m still on the OEM headers and cat. Of all the mods I have on my car, I #8217;ve touched the engine itself the least. Ideally, I #8217;d get either the Spoon 4-2 and pair it with the OEM ITR 2-1 header, or get the FEEL #8217;s 4-2 and 2-1. The Spoon 2-1 doesn #8217;t come with a cat, and I can #8217;t stand the idea of cutting up such a beautiful piece to weld on a cat, hence the ITR 2-1. The FEEL #8217;s header system is two pieces, and the 2-1 collector does come with a high-flow cat, I #8217;m just not sure if it #8217;ll pass smog very easily since most shops are tightening down on actually checking parts and CARB numbers. The Spoon catback I #8217;m running means it #8217;s all coming down to 2.5 #8221; piping anyway, so unless I #8217;m doing some major work to the intake side of things, I don #8217;t see myself needing a very aggressive header.

K24 is the cost-effective way to do things, but I don't like losing compatibility with street-able/Japanese parts. Off-the-shelf K24/K20 headers are basically all race-spec parts (big tubing, no cat), which I wouldn't run on a daily. K24 swap mounts are polyurethane, which I also hate lol.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s just ARC #8217;s product name. Like J #8217;s Racing Tsukihiko airbox, for example. ARC makes them for quite a few cars, but they #8217;ve all been discontinued, especially after ARC first closed up shop a few years ago. They #8217;re back now, but only making a small selection of parts. It #8217;s definitely a very rare piece; maybe as rare as the original Comptech Icebox. I only know of one other person with an ARC DC5 box at the moment, @_charged on IG. His DC5 is definitely an inspiration. It #8217;s basically a vacuum chamber for a huge 5 #8221; velocity stack. Amazing throttle response, and even more amazing noise. Noticeably better mid-range pull.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Without spacers, your wheels would just be tucked in a little more; technically you don #8217;t have to. It #8217;ll probably look almost the same as stock, since you #8217;re running a wider wheel as well, so the choice is yours. All a spacer does is sit between your hub and the wheel. The important part is having enough thread on your wheel studs, which is why some wider spacers come with their own studs; you bolt down the spacers, then bolt your wheels to the spacers. Cheap things are made cheaply so it #8217;s really up to you, but a spacer that #8217;s just a sheet of metal doesn #8217;t have to be really expensive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm the kind of guy that hates having to do (or pay for) things more than once, so I've been holding off on KPro until I have more substantial work to the engine done. I don't want to have to pay for a dyno-tune more than once or twice. I may consider getting KPro after I have an RBC and 70 or 72mm throttle body put in, but if I had my way, I'd have Spoon cams, RDX injectors, and whole handful of other things installed before I had a tune done. I put a priority on getting suspension and brakes dialed first, since RSXs just aren't that fast to begin with. Any money put into the engine, I could get much more out of the car putting it into other places first. The transmission especially completely changed the car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like I said, I prioritized different parts of the car, namely, the suspension and brakes, then later the transmission. Bolt-ons and Kpro together cost what? Maybe $2000? $2500 if you buy some nicer stuff? And that #8217;ll net you what? 15WHP? And that extra power will be going to a FWD chassis with inherently bad suspension geometry and steering characteristics. Power isn #8217;t everything. The way I saw it, I would get all the driver #8217;s mods done first: get the car to handle as well as possible so that it could take more power later on, and to brake as well as possible so I could carry more speed later into a corner on the track. Then the Spoon 5.1 final drive shortened the gears and increased torque pretty substantially, and now the car can really put the extra power down through the LSD. I #8217;d take an LSD over an extra 15WHP any day of the week. I could get a better experience putting time and effort into suspension, tires, brakes, etc. than I could in some basic bolt-ons. Not to mention, I don #8217;t want to run a CAI, because it hurts throttle response and puts you at risk of hydrolock, and I don #8217;t want to run a race header, because I daily the car and don #8217;t want an obnoxious ride that won #8217;t pass smog. And I like bougie Japanese stuff. It #8217;s a problem. Sue me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're serious about performance modding, save up for the full-fledged Kpro install. The Hondata reflashes are decent, but they will not get the full potential out of your car and cannot be adjusted. They're a mild option for casual drivers who want just a little more power out of the car. And I do mean *a little*. But you'll have to run a base map on Kpro unless you have enough put aside for a good tune on a dyno. I'd rather put time and money into the suspension and tires before Kpro, but that's just me.</TEXT>

To get Kpro on the car, you #8217;ll have to swap to an 02-04 ECU and get a harness adapter. 02-04 ECU is not compatible with 05-06 harness and vice versa.

Basically, DC5s get terrible bump steer when lowered and don #8217;t respond well to cheap coilovers. What I #8217;m talking about with ECUs is pretty simple. KPro only runs on 02-04 ECUs and KTuner only runs on 05-06 ECUs. So if you want to run one or the other, you have to have a compatible ECU. Kpro is more widely use, so many 05-06 owners will swap in an 02-04 ECU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha no these cars aren #8217;t going to be worth anything and this nostalgia tax and Honda speculation in the auction market is really getting tiring. DC2 Type Rs are one thing. Sure, they made over *30,000* of them, but the US  #8220;only got 3,800 #8221; so they #8217;re  #8220;rare #8221;. Sure, the Japanese-market Type Rs are literally better in every way and were manufactured on the same assembly line, but yeah, let #8217;s just think the USDM ones are worth *$80,000* EM1s were the only way to get a B16 in the US; also the closest we got to the original EK9 Type R, but 30,000 EM1s were made, and 16,000 EK9s were produced, so neither of those are particularly rare. But yeah, let #8217;s just think EM1s are worth *$50,000* And now we have people asking NSX prices for S2000 CRs. I love Hondas more than anything; you might even call it an obsession, but these cars were all *heavily* mass produced. You could argue for cars like the DC2R and S2000 CR that the exclusivity adds value, but that literally doesn #8217;t apply to the RSX. Some baller wanted an RSX Type S and got what #8217;s probably the cleanest one still on the planet. Good for him. But anyone who out there who #8217;s using sales like this as benchmarks is a fool. These auctions reflect how much *a single person* wanted the car. It shouldn #8217;t be used to judge the holistic demand for a particular model. *One person* paid $80,000 for a Type R. The problem comes when everyone else starts thinking they #8217;ll sell their Type R for just as much. It #8217;s literally just speculation happening. Anyone who #8217;s taken half an economics class knows where this will go.</TEXT>

K24 is the cost-effective way to do things, but I don't like losing compatibility with street-able/Japanese parts. Off-the-shelf K24/K20 headers are basically all race-spec parts (big tubing, no cat), which I wouldn't run on a daily. K24 swap mounts are polyurethane, which I also hate lol. I'm also hopelessly addicted to bougie Japanese parts.</TEXT>

Thicker rear sway bar will make a noticeable difference to how the car drives, especially when paired with a good track alignment. It gives the car a tendency to snap though, so be careful out there.

Check the shift into second from both first and third both while stationary and while driving. Keep in mind that if it shifts poorly, it #8217;s not *necessarily* the transmission. The clutch master/slave cylinders on DC5s are also prone to failure, and if they aren #8217;t working properly, or need to be bled, the car may shift poorly. Drive around in second gear. Accelerate relatively hard in second gear. Listen for grinding. Should go without saying, grinding is very obvious; you won #8217;t miss it. While doing so, also watch to see if the gear lever pops out of second. Congratulations, you #8217;ve successfully diagnosed whether or not a car has second gear grind.

    <TEXT>Define good power and define cheap. IMO, no, you can #8217;t, because the car already makes  #8220;good power #8221;, and the money is much better spent on these cars invested into suspension and other drivers #8217; mods. These cars (the Type S) make roughly 180WHP stock. After $2000-3000 in bolt-ons (intake, RBC manifold, header, high-flow cat, Kpro) you *might* see 200-210WHP. If you shell out the cash for a dyno-tune you #8217;ll top out around 220HP. But the 05-06 RSX doesn #8217;t take Kpro, so the most you can do for a tune is flash with KTuner. You probably won #8217;t see that 220WHP unless you get Kpro, which requires a swap over to an 02-04 ECU. Getting all that done *alone* is over $1000. So now you #8217;re nearly $4000 *or more* invested and you make a little more power, but it #8217;s going into a FWD chassis with no LSD, and inherently poor suspension and steering geometry characteristics. *No*, cheap coilovers don #8217;t fix it because you get a metric ton of bump and torque steer the moment you lower the car. I could rant about this all day. The DC5 is a great platform, but power shouldn #8217;t be your first priority. Like any Honda, it shines in the corners and its ability to carry speed through them. You get *much* more out of the car putting your money into things like wheels, tires, suspension, geometry adjustment, and brakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lowering the car is where the steering and suspension geometry issues stem from; at stock height, the car handles more or less neutral. For some reason, Honda decided to mount the steering rack for the DC5 (and EP3 and EM2) half-way up the firewall and to connect the tie rod ends to the top of the strut assembly instead of down low on the knuckles. This did two things: 1.) it made the tie rods very, *very* long, which 2.) means suspension travel and engine movement (because the car is FWD) can have more leverage over the car #8217;s steering. This leads to both bump steer (obviously) and torque steer. How does it get you torque steer, you ask? Well, anything that unsettles the car, in this case, bumps in the road and engine movement, will influence both steering input and suspension movement, and lowering the car immensely increases the effects of all of that. And don #8217;t forget that the RSX comes stock with an open-diff, and so if one wheel (when turning, typically the inside wheel) starts losing traction, because you hit a bump, etc., it starts getting all the power and spinning, so you get wheel-hop and yes, torque steer. Lowering the car also messes with the car #8217;s roll center, which also decreases traction, and with an open-diff, means you will get wheel-hop and torque steer. [Edit] Also, I didn #8217;t say *off-the-shelf* coilovers, I said *cheap* coilovers. I can #8217;t say anything about the damping and track performance of Stance coilovers over more proven brands like Progress or KW, but at around $1400 they #8217;re not the cheapest coilover sets out there. That they offer adjustment to the RSX #8217;s poor suspension geometry is an impressive consideration, but that still makes my point: suspension stuff is expensive, and the money (when first starting with the car) is better spent there than it is making power.</TEXT>

I do get some resonance between 2-3K RPM, like if I #8217;m trying to climb a hill mashing the gas in 5th gear, and cold starts are a little noisy, but it idles basically as quiet as stock. I get to listen to little pops and burbles driving around town, and the sound it makes when you open up the throttle is great.

    <TEXT>Slower, but in many cases that #8217;s a good thing. Even if it #8217;s RWD, because it #8217;s so balanced it #8217;s a much easier to drive for a novice IMO. That #8217;s not to say it #8217;s easy though. The S2000 still has a tendency to snap, it #8217;ll just snap a little more predictably because it #8217;s smaller and lighter. The Evo just grips all day, but because of that it will go so far before you reach the limit and won #8217;t telegraph that to you until it #8217;s too late. So the Evo will also snap, just later and much less predictably.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They don #8217;t actually do much for cooling either. Drilled rotors don #8217;t help a rotor cool more effectively than a normal vented rotor, and if you really want to lower brake temps, you should look into a dedicated brake duct. If anything, a drilled rotor is inherently weaker than a blank or slotted rotor. Putting holes in a cast piece of metal that goes through extreme heat cycles only adds more stress points for the rotor to warp or crack. Slotted rotors were designed not for heat, but to allow gasses from cooked brake pads to escape and to remove the glazing that would sometime form on the pad surface. Modern pad compounds don #8217;t suffer from either of those to the extent that they used to, and so even slotted rotors offer very little benefit over blank ones. Like you said, the brake pad compound itself is a significantly bigger factor in improving stopping performance. I would argue tires are even more important.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RSX-S is the slowest, safest, and therefore the most fun. It #8217;s also the one I work on most, so it #8217;s the most satisfying to drive hard, knowing all the work was worth it. S2000 is the smoothest, most balanced and most rewarding. I #8217;ve only tracked the RSX-S and S2000 so far. It likes to snap though, and I don #8217;t feel confident driving it hard in the canyons or anything. Evo is the fastest, wildest, and most dangerous. The AWD makes you feel invincible, and will take you a lot further than any novice driver can handle. The car will kill you if you let it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not a fan of TEIN coils, but yes, you #8217;d need to roll your fenders and have some camber in the rear to fit a +30. I #8217;d also recommend geometry adjustment no matter what coilovers you #8217;re using. If the car is lowered at all, it needs roll-center adjustment or *at least* inverted tie rods. I #8217;m currently running a mild track alignment, -2 #176; in the rear, -1.8 #176; up front. With rolled fenders and at this height, I don #8217;t get any rubbing. With a +30, you #8217;ll probably have to run a bit more camber in the rear, up to -2.5 #176;. If you do that I #8217;d recommend you have a little bit of toe in, maybe 0.5 #176;. That will help with stability, since running too much rear camber will make the car very slippery out back. If you don #8217;t want to run as much camber, you could just raise the car a little bit. That #8217;s what I would do on a dedicated street car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s a lot of misinformation out there. Not all of it is unfounded, but generally speaking these are not unreliable cars. Maintenance is a little more intensive (as is any AWD, turbocharged car), but nothing is prone to spontaneous failure. The 5MT in the Evo VIIIs and IXs are bulletproof, but a lot of people like to say the 6MT is weaker, which I suppose it is. What Mitsubishi did for the 6MT transmissions was just add another gear in the same 5MT casing. Meaning now there was an extra gear producing more friction and heat, but less fluid to cool it all. The 6MT gears had a tendency to bind after people were drag racing or track the cars for extended periods of time. For daily driving, there #8217;s really no issue, and a transmission fluid cooler remedies most of the above issues for the 6MT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If this car is just going to be a daily commuter, the RSX is going to be significantly less comfortable. The chassis is light, but old, meaning it vibrates, shakes, and rattles. New struts and tall tires help, but it won #8217;t ride anywhere as nice as an E90 3-series. It #8217;ll be a lot more reliable and probably better on gas though. Definitely a lot more fun and cheaper to take care of, so if that #8217;s something you need right now, it #8217;s not a bad choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;ll need an alignment anyway if you #8217;re installing coilovers, so the camber adjustment is unavoidable. Geometry adjustment is technically optional. If you #8217;re not looking at tracking the car, you could do without it, I just consider it a bit unsafe to drive around with compromised steering. Maybe consider A-Spec or Type R struts. These are OEM options, so there #8217;s not much need for camber or geometry adjustment. Those are non-adjustable but will work right out of the box.</TEXT>

I saw him selling a pair of Amazon H1 LEDs for $80 or something. Wiring was very simple, just a cut and splice; there #8217;s a guide on ClubRSX. A lot of people like to wire them as parking lights + blinkers but it #8217;s technically not OEM and when you do that the side markers aren #8217;t synchronized with the indicators; they #8217;ll blink opposite of each other. I have mine wired as just indicators.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what you mean by "from the ground up". The DC5 is probably one of the worst victims of partsbin construction to come out of Honda, and did not escape the "senioritis" that Honda went through in the early 2000s. The steering rack design came from a people carrier and is designed to make steering column installation easier so that the same part can be used in multiple cars. In the US, the EM2 Civic, EP3 Civic, and DC5 RSX all used the same steering rack. And that's just to my knowledge; I wouldn't be surprised if more models did as well. It's the single biggest design flaw with the DC5/EP3. Instead of mounting the steering rack low in line with the control arms, it's installed halfway up the firewall with *huge* tie rods almost 2.5' long. The DC5/EP3 chassis had a very strong tendency to bump steer, especially when lowered, and was not as easy to fine tune as the double-wishbone design from the previous DC2 and EK9. And this is just *one* thing. The ball joints on the car aren't mounted on the control arms, they're inverted and installed in the knuckle, and the tie rods connect up high on the strut instead of behind the knuckle as well. There's no performance benefit to doing this; it makes it easier for Honda to reuse the same parts on other cars, while making maintenance and geometry adjustment much more difficult. The car wasn't designed specifically to be a Type R; that's just marketing In fact, Honda's whole point with the Type R was to create a performance car out of an existing platform. From an performance engineering standpoint, the DC5 is an inferior chassis to the DC2 and the 6th and 7th-generation Civics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do as much as I can. Only big thing I didn't do myself was the transmission because I knew someone that could do it much better. It was put together by the same guy who does transmission work for Spoon Sports USA, @ghostwerks on IG. I'm definitely looking to keep this car with me for as long as possible. I don't see myself ever selling it; I love it too much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you need a car at school to get around or to go back and forth from home? If you don't need the car with you and you can use either public transport or get rides from friends, then it might be best to just quell your anxiety and leave the car at home. Theft-proofing can go a long way. Even simple measures like a steering wheel lock will deter most thefts. Wheel locks are almost useless against a determined thief, but locking lug nuts are a very worthwhile investment IMO. These are lug nuts that require a key or adapter to remove all 20 lug nuts, rather than just one lock on each wheel. Fuel pump kill switch is a very common addition and there are many writeups on the process on ClubRSX. If you're parking the car for an extended period of time (winter or spring break, etc.) you could remove the fuel pump relay itself, behind the glove box. Lastly, you could install something like a Viper alarm, but I personally find these aftermarket alarms almost not worth the hassle. I've heard too many stories of the alarms just completely glitching out, from constant false alarms to locking the immobilizer. Viper alarms seem to prevent their owners from driving away more than actual thieves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a liftback, so minus huge points for practicality. It also weighs about 100lbs more, but it #8217;s arguably more comfortable than a DC5, even if it doesn #8217;t get leather seats. K24Z7 in the Si is cool but early models didn #8217;t actually have VTEC, and in the later ones that do, the heads don #8217;t have true VTEC. Makes more torque and comes stock with an LSD, which is something USDM DC5s sorely needed, but it doesn #8217;t rev as high, and again, the Z7 head, to some, is a step backwards from the older K20A and K24A. Parts selection is limited because Japan never got this generation civic, so you #8217;re stuck with whatever you kind find in the US, which is usually very aggressive, i.e, K-Tuned, Invidia, PLM, etc. Nothing subtle, and no authentic JDM stuff, which I #8217;m a sucker for. They #8217;re not particularly rare either, at least in this part of California. I wouldn #8217;t want one. I don #8217;t see much of a benefit over my car besides being newer, which isn #8217;t something I really care for; even the gas mileage is about the same. The only real card it has over a DC5 is the LSD, which I already had installed in my car, so that doesn #8217;t matter anymore. It has some newer creature comforts, maybe, but it #8217;s not something I would give up my car for, especially with all the work I #8217;ve done to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm against non-functional crap that people throw on to clutter up their cars. Splitter rods are meant to use the frame of the car to hold up the splitter (see those pictures of people standing on their splitters). A functional splitter can produce enough force that the plastic clips holding it to the bumper or those that are holding the bumper onto the car simply aren't enough to support all the weight. Connecting a splitter rod to the bumper cover that the splitter is mounted to is like wall-mounting your TV to the drywall and not the studs. It's worse actually; it's more like screwing wood studs into drywall, *and then mounting the TV to those studs*. It's doubly redundant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on the mileage and condition. The cars can shrug off high mileage (I wouldn #8217;t hesitate buying one with 200K+ miles), but only if the owners have been diligent. Clutch master and slave cylinder tend to go bad. 2nd and 3rd gear are prone to grind/pop-out if the transmission wasn #8217;t taken care of. Valve cover and VTEC solenoid tend to leak oil. IACV gets clogged easily as well, and the car will idle high. Power steering pump can go bad, but that #8217;s less common than the other things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It won #8217;t harm anything, but you #8217;re more or less throwing money away. If you #8217;re that worried about preventing carbon buildup, spray a can of Seafoam into the intake every few thousand miles. The car has something built into it that prevents hunk and dirt from entering the engine. It #8217;s called a fuel filter and an air filter. If anything, port fuel injection motors are less susceptible to carbon deposit build up because fuel is injected before the valves, meaning it #8217;ll clean up anything it flows over. Octane is resistance to predetonation, or knock. On a low compression engine like the K20A3 in the base model RSX, you don #8217;t need to run higher octane fuel. That high octane fuel is  #8220;healthier #8221; for the engine is basically a myth. Shell V-Power might have whatever additives they say that help keep the engine clean but it #8217;s almost all snake oil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here #8217;s food for thought. Do you consider the JDM *Honda* DC2 Type R and the USDM *Acura* DC2 Type R the same car? Both were manufactured at the same time, on the same assembly line, at the same plant. If more people knew that the USDM Type R was worse than it #8217;s Japanese-market equivalent in every measurable way (namely the engine and interior), and that while there were only roughly 3,800 USDM Type Rs shipped to the US, the total number of JDM DC2 Type Rs manufactured exceeded 30,000 units, it would lose a lot of the exclusivity it #8217;s seeing in the auction market, right? Why would someone pay $80,000 for a US-market version of car that is much better and much less expensive everywhere else in the world, especially now that 1995-spec DC2s are legal to import into the US? There #8217;d be no reason for this if they were considered the same car; if it were just a badge change. I #8217;m not asking whether or not you agree on its value, because I certainly don #8217;t, but the fact remains that one is a USDM Acura Integra Type R, with a USDM VIN, of which only 3,800 were made. The other is a JDM Honda Integra Type R, with a JDM serial number. They are, unfortunately, not the same car. Very, *very* similar cars, but not the same car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. It means it #8217;s an AUDM Honda Integra Type R (for the first model year; it was later changed to Integra Type S after Honda was sued for false advertising). If anything, it #8217;s far better than a USDM Acura RSX Type S; same K20A2 engine, but better transmission, with better brakes and better seats. I #8217;m not sure where you #8217;re going with this since it only proves my point that they #8217;re different cars. An AUDM Honda Integra Type R/Type S is *not* the same as a USDM Acura RSX Type S. Just like how a JDM Honda Integra Type R is not the same as a USDM Acura RSX Type S. Again, they #8217;re all very similar; practically identical, but they #8217;re not the same car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura_RSX/comments/dvmrhz/does_anyone_auto_x_their_rsx/f7dwaft/) is a link to a write-up I did a while back that was added to the sidebar. If you're interested in a crash-course in DC5 suspension tuning, you could give that a read. TL;DR DC5 steering/suspension geometry is inherently flawed and when the car is lowered, the bump-steer and torque-steer characteristics are worsened significantly. Fixing it takes the addition of a handful of parts. Getting an alignment is a given when installing new suspension, but I do gloss over alignment in that post as well. If you haven't purchased the coilovers themselves yet, you may want to reconsider whether or not coilovers are for you in the first place. A-Spec or Type R struts are a much better choice for a majority of owners, and are better than most of the cheap coilovers that people end up buying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could, but why would you? If you were going to invest in quality coilovers, wouldn't you want to get the most that you could out of them? Without the geometry adjustment, you'd still be leaving potential on the table, even after all the extra money spent. Unless you're thinking of doing the adjustment later down the line? It's a lot easier to do it all at once. If you're not interested in doing the extra work to fix the steering geometry (and there's nothing wrong with that), A-Spec or Type R struts are still a very good option. You get a mild drop and tighter handling characteristics, without severely compromising elements of the driving dynamic. With good tires, you'd be surprised how well the car performs at autocross or HPDE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Taller gears or a taller final drive are a very common modification specifically for high boost applications. NA cars make their torque up high, so shorter gears keep them in the power band longer. With big turbos, longer gears means you stay on boost longer, meaning times can actually improve even with taller gearing. Depending on what car you took the K24 from, there #8217;s either a 4.3 or 4.7 final drive in the transmission. The smaller the number, the taller the gearing. TSX and Civic Si both came with the tallest gearing of all the K-series, so if you want anything taller, you #8217;ll have to tear it open and change it yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suspension between the base model and Type S is identical. Only the A-Spec package on the Type S got stiffer struts in the US, and only after 2005 did the Type S get a thicker, 21mm rear sway bar. Besides the engine, transmission, and everything that bolts to those (like the axles, etc.), the only thing you #8217;ll need is a Type S brake proportioning valve, since Type S brakes had bigger rotors and calipers up front. K24 has always been the most cost-efficient way to make all-motor power with a K-series, I just don #8217;t personally like it because it requires you to run parts that are too aggressive for a daily IMO. For example, the only off-the-shelf K24 swap exhaust manifolds available are all race headers going into 3 #8221; exhaust, which is *terrible* on a daily. I seem to be in the minority of people who want to keep a cat on their car though, for whatever reason. But that #8217;s my $0.02. A K24 with a K20 head is basically the endgame build for any all-motor K-series. In a daily, I #8217;m not that sold on the idea, but I #8217;d love to throw one in a track-dedicated car someday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s an easy enough DIY job.

Some will tell you to come back tomorrow. So easiest and quickest thing is to just do it yourself one weekend before you have anywhere to go. You can grab a valve cover gasket and replace that while you #8217;re at it.

    <TEXT>4.7 final drive in 05-05 RSX Type S is the same one as the JDM DC5 Type R. If you #8217;re rebuilding your transmission, skip the cheap made-in-China  #8220;carbon #8221; synchros and stick to OEM. You #8217;re asking below about a 5.1 final drive. I had my transmission built a few years ago with a Spoon 5.1 final drive, MFactory LSD, and OEM FA5 Civic Si 6th gear swap. The OEM unit is very good, but the MFactory is just as good and comes with a lifetime warranty. You can likely get it for cheaper as well. The shorter final drive makes a huge difference from the 02-04 4.3. Torque increases from 142 lb.ft. to roughly 169 lb.ft., without even touching the engine. The LSD makes putting the extra torque down seamlessly easy, as long as your suspension has also been adjusted to handle it. The 5.1 final drive paired with the taller FA5 6th gear means 1st-5th is short and torque-y for the track, and 6th gear is still tall, meaning highway cruising is still completely tolerable. With my current setup, 75MPH is about 3400RPM. Still lower than stock gearing with the 4.3, IIRC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EP3 Si did not get an LSD, but yes, an LSD makes a very big difference to a FWD car, even at stock power. For daily driving, it #8217;s not a big deal, but for performance driving it #8217;s quintessential. You can turbo just about anything. Typically, you #8217;d want lower compression for a turbocharged build, but that doesn #8217;t necessarily mean the A3 handles it well. The head is still a big step back from an A or A2 head, and is the engine #8217;s biggest limiting factor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A3 heads don #8217;t have true VTEC. What traditional VTEC does is change valve lift and duration by locking a second, higher cam profile in place to provide more power. Basically having a low profile cam for driving around town, and a high profile cam for more performance. Traditional i-VTEC does the same, but also adds variable timing and cam angle. In the A3, there is no second cam profile. What the A3 head does is limit how much the second intake valve opens. One intake valve per cylinder is always fully open, and the second opens variably. So when VTEC engages on an A3, it #8217;s just opening the second valve fully. The engine and cam profiles are not changing. This is also on the intake cam only; the exhaust cam has no VTEC. The A3 head was designed for economy in mind, not for performance, so generally speaking it does not flow as well as an A or A2. With tuning you can change when VTEC engages, but the reason you #8217;d ditch the A3 head is simply because it doesn #8217;t flow as well and doesn #8217;t rev as high. The valvetrain just isn #8217;t as stout.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had my transmission completely worked at ~120K miles. Installed an MFactory helical LSD, Spoon 5.1 final drive, FA5 Civic Si 6th gear, and all new OEM synchros and bearings. LSD doesn #8217;t cause any noticeable power drain; completely changed how the car drove on the track. The 5.1 final drive makes a lot more torque than the original 4.3, and the LSD means the car can really put it down and claw its way out of corners. Geometry adjusted suspension also meant there was no hopping out of corners due to bump or torque steer. Biggest con to the job was the time and cost. It #8217;s a very, *very* big job, which is why I encourage those who are looking to pull the trigger to save up and do as much as possible at once. Dropping the transmission out of the car itself is a huge ordeal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The bumper has seen better days and doesn #8217;t look like the entire front end is lining up very well, particularly the driver side. It looks like the bumper and headlights aren #8217;t sitting flush with the hood and fenders. You might want to ask if it #8217;s been in an accident. That he #8217;s calling it  #8220;low mileage #8221; is almost a joke, but I suppose 117K should be considered on the lower side for RSXs these days. To be fair, these cars can shrug off mileage but it #8217;s all down to how the owner took care of it. I wouldn #8217;t hesitate buying one with over 200K as long as the previous owners have been diligent. For $5K it #8217;s not a terrible deal, but there #8217;s plenty of stuff on the car to leverage it down to $4K. The bumper, the seats, etc. IACV might not have to be replaced; they get clogged easily and the car will idle high, but it #8217;s rare that they fail entirely cause a CEL. It could potentially be something else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>~~I don #8217;t think that #8217;s true at all.~~ Correction: I don #8217;t think there #8217;s any relation to some art style. Offset license plate mounting started mostly because older Japanese cars would mount aftermarket intercoolers or oil coolers externally (see C10 Skyline, S30 Fairlady, A30 Celica, etc.), as there was no room for them inside the engine bay, and those old OEM bumpers did not have venting for anything other than the radiator. Japan DOT is very strict on front plate requirements, so because the license plate could no longer be mounted in the middle, they were bolted to the corners of the bumper. There #8217;s a practical application for offset plate mounting. The only Japanese vehicle to come with OEM offset license plate mounting to my knowledge was the Lancer Evolution, starting with the Evo VI, as not to restrict airflow to the front-mounted intercooler. If the car doesn #8217;t have anything upfront to be obstructed (like Subarus with there top-mounted intercoolers), there #8217;s no point in having an offset plate. But I guess it #8217;s  #8220;JDM, bro #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn #8217;t matter how much you spend on coilovers, they will not be more comfortable than OEM-style struts from KYB. Low-end adjustable compression and rebound are inconsequential in their effect on how the car rides, and when you cough up the dough on expensive sets that *do* have proper compression adjustment, you #8217;re looking at coilovers that are designed entirely for track use (and therefore not very comfortable). Those cheap TEINs and BCs that people like to buy are not more comfortable than OEM struts, and no amount of adjustment will change that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you #8217;re just commuting, stick to OEM struts. Want something a little more aggressive? Look for OEM A-Spec or Type R struts. Think you want to drive this car on the track and are ready to handle all the issues that come with lowering this car? KW coilovers if you have money, Progress Competition if you don #8217;t. *Don #8217;t actually care about handling, steering/suspension geometry, ride quality, comfort, or safety and just want to lower for looks?* Get Koni Yellow struts and Eibach Ground Control lowering springs.

For wheels just stick to 16 #8221; or 17 #8221; and don #8217;t go wider than 8.5 #8221; with a relatively high offset (+30 or more) and you won #8217;t have any fitment issues with a square sidewall profile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the mileage and the black interior the price isn't bad, but whether or not it's a good buy will depend on a multitude of other things. For one, the car is slammed, can't say on what. Probably cheap eBay coilovers. Driver (left) side rear quarter panel was damaged and was repaired (very mediocre) then repainted. Cheesy shift boot, unpainted eBay wing and rear lip, and the not-sitting-flush aftermarket head unit are all red flags in my book. Gives you an idea of the kind of guy the owner is and the kind of budget the car has been maintained on. Not to mention there are no pictures of the instrument cluster or the engine bay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love driving my car too, and I hate to be the guy that says what should be obvious, but please be safe driving out on public roads. It #8217;s not just the risk you pose to yourself, but to everyone else around you. Backroads may be sparsely populated, but all it takes is one blind corner and some bad timing to ruin everyone #8217;s day. If anything, imagine some kid who doesn #8217;t know what he #8217;s doing crashing head-first into you because he overcooked it coming into a corner and crossed into oncoming traffic. Personal rant, but I dislike  #8220;canyon runs #8221; specifically because there are immature drivers that don #8217;t know the limits of their cars and are pushing them on *public* roads. Best case is they drive their car into the barrier and learn their lesson. Worst is they don #8217;t and the next time they do it, they cross the median in a blind corner. Snap oversteer is not to be underestimated, even in a FWD car. Even if it isn #8217;t as light as a DC2 Integra or EG/EK Civic, a DC5 *will* spin if you let it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>JDM DC5 Integra was split into two models, the iS/Type S and the Type R. Everyone knows about the Type R. K20A, LSD 6MT, etc. JDM equivalent to the base model RSX was the Integra iS (01-03) and Integra Type S (04-06). Same K20A3 as the base model with 5AT or 5MT.  gt;I #8217;ve never heard of that nor can I find any info about that. You didn #8217;t look very hard. [From Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Integra_DC5)  gt; The iS/Type S (not to be confused with the RSX Type-S), which was essentially the same as the base Acura RSX, featured the K20A3 engine with an output of 160 hp (120 kW) and mated to either a 5-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. The 2001-2003 iS was available with 15-inch steel wheels with covers, or optional 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. The 2004-2006 Type S was equipped with 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels shared with the RSX Type-S.</TEXT>

Downside is that there is a little more resonance when holding the throttle around 2K RPM (imagine going up a hill in 6th gear). But most importantly, highway and idle characteristics remain unchanged. Still no highway drone between 75-80MPH (~3500RPM) besides wind and engine noise, and idle when warm is as quiet as OEM. Tone remains unchanged; very deep and very smooth. Cold starts are noisier, however.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As much as I love my car, I definitely wouldn #8217;t call it perfect. From a performance standpoint, it was plagued with a number of suspension and steering design flaws that made it objectively worse than the DC2 that came before it. It #8217;s a much better daily and all-around car, and the K20 is a monster of an engine, but as far as driving performance goes it definitely isn #8217;t the best platform out there. Couple of modifications will change the car completely though. LSD, shorter final drive, and fixes to the aforementioned suspension have completely changed the car, and I would take it over a DC2 any day of the week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The K20A and K20Z1 head are almost identical. The valvetrain and camshafts are the same; the Type R K20A engine received a thicker head gasket and slightly different intake manifold. That was on facelift 05-06 models though. This is an 02-04, so it was equipped with the K20A2 like the UKDM EP3 Type R and the AUDM Integra Type S.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Hot air intake #8221; is colloquial for most short ram intakes since by design, the air inlet is still located near hot engine components. They #8217;re one in the same. Short rams sound nice and improve throttle response slightly, but overall an airbox is always the best option, OEM or otherwise. Cold air intakes make more peak horsepower, but lack in the midrange, worsen throttle response because the intake piping is made longer, and in many cases put your car at risk of hydrolock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shorter final drive shortens gearing, increasing torque (acceleration) and decreasing top speed. 02-04 OEM final drive was 4.3. 05-06 was bumped to 4.7 to match the JDM Type R, but I have a Spoon 5.1 installed. Jumping from the 4.3 to 5.1, torque increased from 142 lb.ft. to roughly 169 lb.ft., without even touching the engine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ll just post my parts list below. The engine is mostly stock, but the transmission, suspension, and brakes are fully sorted. Shorter Spoon 5.1 final drive makes a little more torque (142lb.ft. up to 169lb.ft.) and MFactory LSD really help to put the power down though. Really focused on driver mods over power. I plan on messing with the engine sometime next year. Also tons of authentic parts. I #8217;m obsessed with nice parts from Japan.

    <TEXT> gt;Copying and pasting my answer from the last time this was asked. Something, something search bar? Not a liftback, so minus huge points for practicality. It also weighs about 100lbs more, but it #8217;s arguably more comfortable than a DC5, even if it doesn #8217;t get leather seats. K24Z7 in the Si is cool but early models didn #8217;t actually have VTEC, and in the later ones that do, the heads don #8217;t have true VTEC. Makes more torque and comes stock with an LSD, which is something USDM DC5s sorely needed, but it doesn #8217;t rev as high, and again, the Z7 head, to some, is a step backwards from the older K20A and K24A. Parts selection is limited because Japan never got this generation civic, so you #8217;re stuck with whatever you kind find in the US, which is usually very aggressive, i.e, K-Tuned, Invidia, PLM, etc. Nothing subtle, and no authentic JDM stuff, which I #8217;m a sucker for. I wouldn #8217;t want one. I don #8217;t see much of a benefit over my car besides being newer, which isn #8217;t something I really care for; even the gas mileage is about the same. The only real card it has over a DC5 is the LSD, which I already had installed in my car, so that doesn #8217;t matter anymore. It has some newer creature comforts, maybe, but it #8217;s not something I would give up my car for, especially with all the work I #8217;ve done to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you don't have a lot of money, and because you're young, not having a lot of money is a big factor in your decisions, then the choice is clear; whichever option is the least expensive. It really shouldn't even be a discussion beyond that point. Whichever vehicle is the cheapest to purchase, cheapest to insure, and cheapest to operate and maintain should be your first and only choice. Should be obvious that it's the RSX. The RSX is already a very practical vehicle. It's one of the few 2-door coupes that sports a liftback and gets as good gas mileage as the GTI while being lower maintenance. As reliable as the GTI is known to be, a turbocharged engine is more complex that a naturally-aspirated one, and at the end of the day, will not stand up to neglect nearly as well, especially against a K20. It's the slowest, but doesn't mean it's the least fun. It's more than fast enough to get you into trouble. I do like GTIs. My dad's first car was a Mk.1 GTI. My first car was almost a Mk. VI GTI, but at the time, I could find a much nicer RSX than I could a GTI for roughly half the price. And like I mentioned above, a 100K mile K20? Wouldn't drop a sweat as long as its been decently cared for. I'd be much more wary purchasing a GTI with the same mileage. But I will concede that a 5-door GTI is more or less a forever car for most people. That car can last you much further into adulthood than an RSX, especially later on when you eventually think about starting a family. I'm biased against the MS3. Not even going to pretend I like them. Mostly comes down to all the MS3 owners I've met, but unfortunately, those cars just strike me as too try-hard. It's the *alt*-Focus ST/RS and Focus/WRX/Evo guys never let them forget it. Bias aside, it's the least fuel efficient of the three by a wide margin, and the Ford (*cough* Mazda) 2.3 turbo from the time just isn't as stout as the K20 or the GTI. IIRC, it's susceptible to bending connecting rods and the turbos are particularly sensitive to oil contamination.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Airbox is always the best overall option, OEM or otherwise. Aftermarket airboxes are among the most expensive options out there, however. Most cost effective solution is the Hondata mod to gut the OEM airbox, then pair it with a high-performance filter. Gains boys will always tell you that cold air intakes make the most peak power and they do (barely), but at the cost of mid-range and lengthening the intake piping, which worsens engine response. CAIs also put your car at risk of hydrolock; all it takes is a 2-3 #8221; deep puddle to potentially ruin your day. Short ram intakes make the car sound sweet, and keeping the intake run itself short means throttle response is nice and snappy, but because the air inlet is sitting right next to hot engine components, you lose power, especially on hot days. If you live in a cooler climate, it #8217;s not as noticeable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just FYI, you have your directions messed up. The passenger side of the car is usually referred to as the right side, and the driver side is the left (hence why we differentiate between LHD and RHD cars). The fan should switch on intermittently at idle once the car reaches about 95 #176;C (204 #176;F). I #8217;m pretty sure the radiator fan switch will throw a CEL, but you could replace it anyway. Radiator fan switch is relatively inexpensive and relatively easy to replace. It #8217;s located underneath the car, on the radiator, next to the lower radiator hose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Sunshields are a dime a dozen. AFAIK there is no  #8220;premium #8221; sunshield. One that #8217;s reflective will do the job as well as any other. If you have the cash, consider ceramic tint from 3M. Blocks out something like 95% of incoming heat. 2. Depends on your insurance deductible. I would fix the chip with something like the Rain-X kit, and consider replacing the windshield if it cracks or worsens later on. 3. I #8217;m actually not sure if the serpentine belt can be rotated on its own. IIRC you can spin the power steering pulley with a wrench, but I #8217;ve never had to. That aside, pulling the belt off and replacing it is very easy and inexpensive. It #8217;s worth doing anyway as preventative maintenance. Do yourself a favor and stick with an OEM belt though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Progress coilovers are awesome. Great choice. I would recommend you pick up some inverted tie rods and extended ball joints to get the full potential out of them. DC5s suspension geometry is wonky and does not like to be lowered. You will also need camber bolts up front and camber arms out back. A stiffer rear sway bar will also make the car much more capable on the track. Keeping the rear end stiff induces oversteer, just be careful not to overcook yourself. 17x9 +35 will fit with mild camber and rolled fenders, perfect for a track alignment (about -2 #176; all around). I #8217;d recommend 245/45 instead though; 235 is a little stretched on 9 #8221; wide wheels. If you want to keep things as efficient as possible, you #8217;d want to get wheels and tires first, then all your suspension components so that you need only one alignment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You shouldn #8217;t be running an aftermarket IM or TB without Kpro. The OEM ECU can #8217;t account for all that extra air. You might #8217;ve been running along just fine because the manifold was still connected to the OEM TB, but all that extra air means you were more than likely running very, *very* lean. Once you do get Kpro, a base map will work as a bandaid solution, but the car really needs to be dialed in on a dyno. As far as TB choice goes, it really just depends on how much you want to spend. General rule of thumb is that bigger TBs make more power but response will suffer. 70-72mm is the sweet spot for most all-motor builds. You won #8217;t see much benefit going up to something as big as 80mm without some head or valve work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bunch of useless knowledge lol. But yeah, basically none of those JDM Type R parts are interchangeable with other DC5s. Obviously they still bolt on, but you need to swap over everything for it to work. You can #8217;t install just the control arms, for example. Type R control arms, hubs, knuckles, front sway bar, even brake rotors are unique to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most K-series 6MT transmissions from the same generation will bolt right on. RSX-S or TSX transmissions are the least expensive. 06-11 Civic Si will work as well and comes with an OEM helical LSD, but is obviously more expensive. Any 6MT transmission that was in a DC5, EP3, CL7, CL9, FA5, FG2, FD2, or FD5 should fit. Transmissions are everywhere on eBay or from parts outlets like HMotorsOnline.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not super familiar with the 5AT trans, but IIRC, it #8217;s not plug and play. The 5AT ECU is not compatible with the 5MT and 6MT trans; I #8217;m not sure if you could make it work with Kpro, I believe you need to swap in a manual ECU/harness for it to work. I also believe the automatic-chassis frame rails on the driver (left) side are different, and so the transmission mount does not fit either; you #8217;d have to have one fabricated.</TEXT>
