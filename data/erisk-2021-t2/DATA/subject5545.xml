    <TITLE>Give my child your pants! [Lengthy]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-01 14:03:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Some context: I #8217;m norwegian and currently 18. This means I graduate Upper Secondary this year. Here we have a thing called  #171;Russefeiring #187; which is essentially graduates wearing a specific clothing item for a month, partying and stuff. Celebrating the graduations, right? What more is that we have sort of  #171;business cards #187; that kids LOVE to collect. They go ballistic over them. This last detail is important. More context: I had recieved my clothing (which is either a pair of pants (overalls used as pants) or a full onesie thing. In my case: pants.) And I was heading out for a driving lesson. I had no clean pants left as I was behind on laundry, and had to use those pants. They look kind of ordinary however there are traits to recognize them. But seeing the graduation/russfeiring period has not started I decided to leave my cards at home. So anyway... EP, and EK as usual, and me. You should know what this means if you #8217;re familiar to the subreddit ^^ Here #8217;s my story; I was done with my driving lesson and was walking through a park on my way home. Now there was an event going on so there was a lot of children here. I already know how this is going to go down, but this is my only route home so I suck it up and prepare myself to be jumped on by kids (almost literally...) A few kids right away run over to me asking me for my  #171;russekort #187;, which are the cards I mentioned. I calmly tell them that I don #8217;t have any with me. This is nothing new, a lot of times meeting a graduate participating in this celebration event they will not carry cards for various reasons. And most kids are fine with that. They all kind of just go  #171;awh.. #187; and walk back. I thought nothing of it. One moment later another kid runs up to me and asks for the same thing; a card. I explain to him that I am currently not carrying cards so I cannot give him one. Note: this kid is the EK. He turns on his heel and SCREAMS for his mother to come over. I #8217;m a bit startled by his sudden scream but well okay. EP walks over to me. Conversation goes approx as follows: EP: why are you harrassing my child? Me: Excuse me? I was not harrassing him... He asked for a card and I told him I didn #8217;t have any. (In the meantime EK is more or less chanting  #171;give me a card! #187;) EP: look, you #8217;re making him sad, can #8217;t you just give him one? Me, confused as I JUST explained I did not have any: I #8217;m sorry, I don #8217;t have any. EP, now squinting at me: I don #8217;t believe you. I unsip the pocket where cards usually go and show her it #8217;s empty. EP: you #8217;re just hiding them. Just give my child a card. Me: I #8217;m not hiding any, I honestly don #8217;t have any cards. EK is now TUGGING on my pantleg (keep in mind this child reaches me about to my waist) Me, looking at EK: Can you please stop that? EP: DON #8217;T TALK TO MY CHILD LIKE THAT Me: I just asked him to stop, he #8217;s going to ruin my pants if he keeps tugging the leg. (They were slim fit, so they expands easily if tugged like that.) EP: just give him a card and he will stop Me: I have told you I don #8217;t have any! EK is still tugging my pants so I decide to force his hands open and step a bit away, so he doesn #8217;t tug them more. EP: don #8217;t touch my child. Just give him a card. This conversation isn #8217;t going anywhere so I decide once again to ATTEMPT getting my point across; Me: I. Do. Not. Have. Any. Cards. I said this and now attempted to leave, but EP blocked my path again. Me: Let me go, I need to get home. EP: not until you give my son something. Me: something? I don #8217;t have anything to give him. EP rolls her eyes, crosses her arms and scans me up and down with her eyes for a second. EP: give him the pants then. Some late context: the pants are often decorated personally for each person. Mine are sewn stuff onto, written stuff on etc. It #8217;s sort of a personal thing. Me: Excuse me what? EP: give him the pants. Me: Uhm, no? Why would I? EK is AGAIN tugging my pants, now closer to the waist, and it seemed he tried to pull them off me. (Maybe that he was doing all along, I don #8217;t know but it was more obvious now.) Me, looking at EK and holding the waist to avoid it being pulled further down: Stop tugging my pants! EK apparently heard that as  #171;tug it more #187; because he started pulling them harder and even BITING the buttons in an attempt to get them opened. At this moment I am in fucking shock; WHAT KIND OF BEHAVIOUR EVEN IS THIS?! Why isn #8217;t the mother stopping it?! WHY IS NO ONE ELSE STOPPING IT?! I try pushing the kid away just to hear a fucking banshee screech from the mother followed by a  #171;do not touch my child #187; esque sentence. Me: Can you please control your child? He #8217;s literally trying to undress me! EP: He #8217;s doing nothing wrong. Just give him the pants. Me: I am not going to give him my pants! I manage to get the kid off of me and just decide to fucking bolt. I push EP aside hard (she actually fell over) and just bolted as fast as I could. I started finding new routes home to avoid her from now on, just in case. TL;DR: some lunatic tried to steal my pants because I did not give her child a card. Now I take a different route home.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>OCD / Forced actions / Eating issues etc... TL;DR at bottom</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-02 06:21:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Question after TL;DR for simplicity* Hiya, I #8217;m diagnosed ADHD from a young age and was prescribed Concerta but stopped using that about 3-4 years ago. Currently 18 and was on meds from age 7-14/15ish. Recently I #8217;m noticing a lot of stuff resurfacing like having problems eating (either going a day without eating, eat a lot at the end but no throwing up like bulimia or eating max once a day (small meal)), and forced actions such as doing unnecessary things that actually annoy me. (I #8217;ve read about OCD and it matches up) TL;DR: Diagnosed ADHD, been on meds, might have eating disorder and OCD now too. - Now, I #8217;m not trying to self diagnose, I #8217;m just wondering is this normal for people with ADHD???</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Give me 14 games for 5,7 dollars!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-11 15:06:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure if this qualifies, but this happened yesterday... Context: So, on a local website, similar to Craigslist I assume, you can sell stuff secondhand. People use it to sell cars, games, dolls, even small jobs, it's very handy. Now, I am selling 14 games on there totalling in 1275 NOK (aka 146 USD), which is very cheap. As everyone else I had to list a price, so I listed the lowest price, being ish 5 dollars (50 NOK) (again which everyone does). I listed total price for all the games in the ad and stuff, and had it published.  #8203; 2 minutes, and I kid you not 2 minutes, after I re-published the ad (because they move to inactive after 60 days), I get a message:  #8203; CB: I want all the games. Me: All of them? CB: Yes, 50 NOK yeah? Me: Not for all of them no... CB: What do you mean? They're clearly listed for 50 NOK! Me: Read the description. It clearly says the individual price for each game and collective for all. CB: Bullshit! You should sell them to me for 50 NOK since you tricked me! Me: What? No. If you see the individual price per game you'd understand why that isn't profitable for me. CB: You tricked me, if you don't give me the games for 50 NOK I will report you! Ship them today and I may consider paying you. Me: Even if I did, you're forgetting the fact you have to pay the shipping price. CB: Because you tricked me, you have to give me the shipping off! Me: Dude, shipping for all of this is about 200 NOK, maybe more. No chance, I'd go even less in profit from this. CB: I'm going to report you! Me: Go nuts. Goodbye.  #8203; I'm looking forward to that report. Will update if he does.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Haunted House</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-17 07:09:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Edit: I forgot to add this at the bottom, but if admins deem this unfitting or not appropriate to this subreddit, tell me and I'll take it down. However, this is a true story, not fictional, so it should be good? Nonetheless. Enjoy.**  #8203; I'm actually unsure if this fits, but it's a story I've been wanting to share for a while.  #8203; Now, I live in a Haunted House. I have no idea why I write it like that, it looks nice I guess.  #8203; Anyway, I digress, story. Me and my family live in a house that was sold on the ground that the owner passed away. The owner's name was Gunnar. This is important, as it revolves around him.  #8203; We joke around that Gunnar is haunting our house, but honestly we're pretty certain he actually is. Reasons behind this is the fact more or less anyone in my family, and even members who left have had experiences with it.  #8203; Context of layout: We used to have the couch and tv so we could sit in the couch and see the stairs to the second floor. While sitting in the couch and watching TV, minding our own business, when we see something in the corner of our eyes near the stairs. This could have been some foolery but here's the deal;I have a boyfriend, my sister recently had one, both of my grandparents (on both sides) are alive, and I have two uncles (one hasn't visited my house tho so leaving him out). My "main" family (aka my sister, parents and me) saw this regularily. My boyfriend who has the attitude to spiritual and religious views as "Prove to me it's real, and I'll believe anything you say. Until then, no." has seen it and confirms it's some weird ass shit, my very christian and very anti-paranormal grandfather has seen it and confirmed it too, the rest of my grandparents, my uncle and my sister's ex boyfriend has seen this. And when we ask them about it, without knowing others have seen this too they described **exactly** what the others said and what we have seen too. **And I mean word for word exactly.** I'll also mention I'm pagan, my mother was pagan, my "main" family is very spiritual, however my boyfriend is not despite being sami, and my grandparents are absolutely not spiritual or believes in paranormal stuff. Not my uncle either. This eventually stopped happening and now stuff's just vanishing from the house or moving around without our need. Like this; I sleep with my laptop in my bed, with this fan-pillow shit under it to keep it from both overheating and burning my bed to shreds. I 100% make sure I plug this into my computer and I always keep it either next to my bed or in my bed. At. All. Times. It's started to become a thing where I leave my room to eat dinner or hang with friends, and when I get back, the fan-pillow isn't in or by my bed, but by my working computer. (More context: We get laptops from school and the laptop I keep in my bed is my school laptop, my actual computer is on my desk and isn't portable.) And you could ask; Maybe your parents/sister moved it? No, my sister absolutely WON'T enter my room at any cost, as it's incredibly warm and she wants nothing to do with it, ever. My parents won't either, due to same reasoning. Like they won't even come to say it's dinner, they just yell it or text me to avoid it. I even lock the room when leaving at this point to avoid this issue but it presists. So no one enters my room to do this, and my laptop is also always on that pillow. Currently also, my sister's keyset is missing, and she was very aware of where it was and **always** put it back just to avoid losing it. And she's a habit person, and this was a habit. No way she could've missed a day there, as she also slightly have OCD so it's kinda driving her nuts not to have her keys. She's currently borrowing my boyfriend's keyset (yes he has his own) as he doesn't use it as much.  #8203; Anywayyy that's my haunted story. This is actively happening heh.. It's a bit of a nuisance and sort of creeping all of us out. Hope you enjoyed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) Am in a relationship, and my partner has been 100% supportive through the entire thing, and shortly after op he was suuuuper careful and insisted on helping me with mostly everything. While he perferred the size they used to be, he said that as long as I #8217;m happy, he #8217;s happy, so yeah overall he #8217;s been absolutely amazing :) 2) It hasn #8217;t really done much, I perfer how they look now because my body is more proportionate than before, and shirts fit way better now. But yeah my self image is already pretty good so it didn #8217;t do much other than me not having to constantly correct my bra to avoid my boobs falling out hahah</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aside from how cringy this is, I can somewhat relate to me being like this, but one thing that seems to happen that annoys me (and not necessarily regarding me at all!) is that someone raises their hand and answers a few questions, then the professor goes  #171;someone else now #187;, which is fine, but then when no one volenteers, he goes on to explaining it himself rather than letting the student who rose their hand answer when he gets no other participant.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m 19 so not a parent biologically yet, luckily. However, I have a friend who just turned 15 and I #8217;m her mother figure, we even spoke about getting me legal responsibility if she moves to my country (it was her suggestion both to move here and the legal guardian thing), so I #8217;m kind of her go-to  #171;mother #187; as her actual mother is veeeery unsupportive (my  #171;daughter #187; is transgender and gay, which her actual mother does not approve of). She got a boyfriend and they seemed cute but over time he just didn #8217;t seem right for her. I refused to tell her because it #8217;d influence her judgement. They broke it off later in such a bad way I wished I had said something. If I ever get a biological daughter (or son!) I won #8217;t make that mistake, of course I #8217;ll avoid interference but if I notice it #8217;s toxic I #8217;ll butt in. No one #8217;s allowed to treat my baby that way.

    <TEXT>It seems you are hellbent that it's a spirit regardless of what others say, however it's an interesting story. I do believe in that myself, as I'm a pagan and it's a big part of my life and I have encountered a few experiences myself. However I have to ask. Did you see the woman in the mirror before the picture was taken? Like did any of you, if you can recall it, notice anything before the picture? An eerie atmosphere, cold spots, or weird sounds? Might be difficult if this was in 2006 though, however if you do recall anything I'd love to know :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh if they can't answer it's because they don't know how they work yet. But that doesn't mean it's lies or incorrect. A few things I picked up from other comments here as well is that you asked for a few spells. If you're a skeptic they have a very low chance of success anyway because you don't believe. Half of the power lies in confidence and believing in that power and in yourself. Many, when met with this, replies that if you HAVE to believe in it for it to work, then it must be fske right? Well. View it this way: you're running a marathon but think you won't make it. Then you won't. If you don't believe you can do it, you can't. Same with magick.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-13 09:34:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Something I struggled with was remembering stuff and getting places in time, so my mother suggested to me I use a sixth sense (like a book for recording events etc?) and got me one. I used it for a while during school and it worked really well. However I.. \*cough\* lost it, by mysterious means (hehe...) and discovered that my phone's calendar is also useful for things like such. So now, since I carry my phone EVERYWHERE, I have all my appointment sorted neatly into a calendar with reminders for it all. (Always put it into the calendar directly, and don't wait and "I'll do it later" etc.) (This serves as a tip to y'all and a reminder for me)  #8203; Also sorry if incorrect flair, was unsure what to put it as but I do see this as a major success for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue tho is there could be something behind it, if she was raised vegan and hasn't eaten meat before or very rarely/been a vegan a long time, the body doesn't really react well to meat. Potentially could be other reasons, but yeah that would still make me uncomfortable outside a resturant :/ Edit: Before anyone asks or shit; No I'm not a vegan, I was a vegetarian and that's how I know cause I started eating meat and almost puked my guts out because I couldn't handle the meat well anymore (ya gotta adjust slowly to it) And yes I am aware this person is a literal choosing beggar, I wasn't trying to disprove it. Just stating there might be a reason making them have to do this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Specifically spellsofmagic is pretty wideknown in the online witch community as a blacklisted site, due to it's lack of reliability. I even checked the spell that was used in OP's post and I doubt it would have worked out as planned again due to this. Sadly I don't work with spells so I cannot recommend any spell sites, though I recommend learning to make them and learning various things such as what oils or incenses to use etc :) It might help more c: Good luck though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well a lot of witches seem to embrace the darkness theme, and perfer more gothic style of makeup and clothes (makeup mainly for the girls but I have seen guys with it too), so I guess that's a stereotype. Personally I consider myself a goth as I like that style and embrace that part of me. My classmates started calling me witch before I even came out to them as one due to my way of dressing haha... So I guess I follow that archetype. :p I can describe more if you give me some pointers as to what you aim for of information.</TEXT>

Many find more power in satanism, but maybe a lot also have a grudge against Christianity for the whole y'know witch hunt and burning people alive deal waaaay back when Christianity spread out.

    <TEXT>A few notes! \- I have one rule on this, or rather a request; Please be respectful. I don't push my religious views or beliefs onto you, so please don't push yours onto me or explain how I'll either burn in hell or such. Other than that, ask ahead. (I've dealt with this before thus I mention it) \- I'm Norse-Kemetic to be specific, but I'm very Eclectic, and open to all. \- I'm also Omnistic! This means I acknowledge the existence of ALL gods. However when I say I'm Norse-Kemetic, it means I only worship certain gods, those being some Norse and some Kemetic. \- I'm very spiritual, and do believe in "ghosts" (though I dislike that term, I used it now for simplicity), along with demons and such. I believe in a heaven and hell, but not the "Christian version". \- I am a witch. Not a broom-flying, green-skinned, big-nose-with-wort witch you see pictures of. But a person who practices witchcraft. There are pagans who aren't witches, and some who are. I am a witch and a pagan.  #8203; With this in mind; Ask away!</TEXT>

If there is any deity in particular you feel drawn to, do some research and maybe leave an offering to them if you can. Or meditate on it. However, all in all, the deity that wants to connect with you will find you when they deem you ready. Edit: Noticed someone saying that and you mentioning having waited for a while. I believe it took 7-8 years until I found the deities I work with currently. So patience is a virtue, but they'll come.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the Tarot of the Cat People, inherited from my mother. Along with Tarot of the Witches. (Leaving picture links below). I personally perfer my Oracle set and Rune set though :3 [Tarot of the Witches picture link](https://lillearkana.no/images/prodimages/big/100205.jpg) [Tarot of the Cat People picture link](https://cdn0.rubylane.com/_pod/item/1721295/1706/Vintage-Tarot-Cat-People-full-1A-700%3A10.10-570-f.png)  #8203; Idk where to buy them though, so I just included these so you can find them if they seem interesting. Of my Tarots, I like the Tarot of the Cat People the best. Both in design and how it feels to use.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-12 19:38:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let's just get right to it. Ait so it's a regular day, but pouring rain. I take my bike to the busstation as I didn't want to walk in the rain. I lock it up and whatever, and go to school. Y'know normal stuff. When I get back however, due to a lot of crap (that isn't relevant to this story) today I was in a super pissy mood. Just wanted to get home and sleep. I get off the bus and see my bike... But there's a child standing there. Leaned over the bike. Trying to unlock it. I walk over and ask what the fuck is going on and the convo goes like this: Me: Uhm, what the fuck are you doing? That's my bike. EB: This is *MY* bike now, **I** found it and finders keepers! Give me the lock combination! Me: What? No? This is my bike, can you fucking not? EB: No! It's mine now! If it's your bike, unlock it! Me: No, you'll try to take it from me. EB: Well duh, it's my bike! Me, really fucking dazed and annoyed: Kid, I don't have time for this. It's POURING down and I want to get home. EB: Me too, so give me the bike! Me: No! I legit try to get to my bike but the kid is blocking me off. To spare some details, it goes back and forth like this for about 10 minutes of stupid arguing, until a car passes and literally soaks both of us in water. I snapped at this point and yelled at this kid with the full power of my voice's wrath (and those who know me, know my voice is strong AF because I grew up talking a lot, so my vocal chords developed very well. At least that's what I've been told is the reason my voice is so strong and loud.) This kid. This kid legit looks scared for her life and runs off. I stand there for a second trying to comprehend what just happened, and get my soaked butt home. Hope this stupid story at least has some entertainment for some, cause it was really fucking weird. *(WHY do I attract people like this? I posted a weird af story many months ago to* r/entitledparents *too, and might post more cause these kind of people seem to follow me)*  #8203; And no, this story isn't fake, but I wish it was. Seriously, I can barely believe it happened myself.</TEXT>

Anything occult. And I received Sarahkkas Guidance Cards. I've absolutely never seen these before, and I'm just blown away! They're beautiful and I'm looking forward to using them. Thank you so much santa, even if the gift arrived a liiiittle too late for christmas; I still love it!
