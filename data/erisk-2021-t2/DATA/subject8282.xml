    <TEXT>Yep Neji was Dull and Kishimoto never focused on him much. He is nowhere in Shippuden and just is in Naruto for 2 arcs. The reason people love him so much might be that he was the first person the Naruto changed so much. Moreover it involved Hinata as well who as we know has a huge fanbase. So Neji is famous because of Naruto and Hinata</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can answer the second question regarding why All Might never unlocked the secrets of OFA. The Quirks become stronger after every generation; at first this was just a fan theory but it was confirmed in the fourth season when Shouto and Bakugou are training for Hero license. (you can just watch the scene where Little Kids come in) However since the Quirks become stronger generation after generation, we can quite surely say that Midoriya had a better chance of unlocking The Unexpoored Potential of OFA. Just a fluke but I guess this quirk amplification may be the reason why All Might could control his quirk while Midoriya cannot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Watch Naruto bit Skip all of the fillers. I mean literally all of them. Skip that and you'll have a decent 400-450 episode series which is quite watchable. And Don't watch Boruto. Go for the Boruto manga if you are really willing to go beyond just Shippuden but don't watch Boruto. It's messed up beyond words.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Askellad: The guy is the epitome of a complex character. He had so many layers to his character that he seemed like a real life person to me rather than a fictional character Madara Uchiha: Honestly, badass is an understatement when you mention Madara. He was a great character with Super resolve and Strength matched by none. Also his believes were quite philosophical and honestly true. Sometimes too harshly true Erwin Smith: Guy is literally both Brain and Braun. He is literally a driving force that is steering the whole of Humanity in the series. If it wasn't for him there's be no Survey Cops making any progress. He was ambitious, had super resolve and was honestly too realistic. Van Hohenheim: This guy was utterly great writing by the writer. He was a sad fellow who suffered all the pain and had no one to talk with about his pain. He knew he had a responsibility and sacrificed a happy life with family just to get the job done. After all the hardships and sadness he is still the most generous and the nicest guy in the series.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Deca Dence; An Original Anime series which aired this year. It just has 12 episodes. There isn't much plot but the basic concept is quite mind blowing. The main story goes straight. There are good fights. There isn't much character writing but the 2 main characters are super interesting. You'll enjoy every single episode. I know there are flaws with this series such as the terrible CGI machines, ambiguity and some unexplained things. But this is what you can expect from a 12 episode anime original. Regardless of all this, I can guarantee you'll enjoy this.</TEXT>

But also, its disgusting to use anyone's private image or video just to satisfy yourself for just a few likes. I've been making memes for like 2 years and I've never done so no matter how big a trend it was. And I plan to do so in the coming times as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since I am from a conservative religious country, I've seen a lot of careers being destroyed and a lot of families that now aren't accepted socially. And that hurts, people make memes and ruin others' lives. And when a sad story comes on Media, well they just feel sorry and some may apologise. But the damage would never be undone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the first season is lame af. But just bear with it for the first season. The second season proves to be a true payoff. Just believe me and watch it. I would've done the same thing if I didn't know how good R2 would be. It's bad but you've already passed first 6 episodes. So just bear with a 15 more. The original story will start from the 22nd episode of the first season. And from there, it's a roller coaster ride full of greatness.</TEXT>

Naruto's canon Episodes end at ep 135 Then jump to Shippuden and start watching it. And there again, watch only canon and Skip fillers. Out of 500 episodes, about 200 are fillers. Skipping them is the best choice. Shippuden is where the story ends. However, if you want to watch the movies, they are standalone stories having nothing to do with the Naruto storyline</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Uchihas were the Oppressed. It was imminent that the Opressed will strike back. Madara had predicted that the Uchihas will be sooner or later The Oppressed class in Konoha. He tried to solve the problem by Asking the Uchihas to leave Konoha. But they never listened and were pushed to the corner where the last option was a Coup. It was their last resort. Every action has a reaction. You cannot go oppressing a certain group for indefinite amount of time. They'll strike back one time. And once the Uchihas knew that they had bore enough oppression and it was time to stand up for themselves. Itachi basically told them to shut the fuck up and just stay an Opressed group which will never be accepted.</TEXT>
