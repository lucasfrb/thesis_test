    <TEXT>Ok i met this girl 2 years ago i didn't like her back then as i do now i can say i really love her. i would say i am 60% sure she does like me since we always (make?) eye contact like most of the time. and she tries on purpose to pass in front of me also my best friend (i ve known him for years(12)) once told me that she texted him saying she likes someone he knows very well with " #128540;" it could be him or me? I don't know but my friend has a girlfriend now soo.. I have some chances:D? Ok before you go and scream at me like "why the fu*k didn't made your move" i am so shy and i am so afraid of rejection. But FINALLY now i feel confident and think i am ready to talk to her but the problem is that i can't seem to find when to talk to her like she's always in class and when she finishes i can't find her.. So in this situation i need advice from high-school girls or at least from experienced guys. What should i tell her? What i shouldn't? (i copied and pasted this from quora because you can't right more than 250 characters :P)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i know this girl for quite awhile now and we didn't really ever spoke so last knight i texted her and we talked a little and i told her that i need to talk to her tomorrow irl... So tomorrow we met but i didn't expect her to bring her friend with her So i stressed out more and i forgot everything i was planning to say so i just told her that i like her and we should meet to know each other more... She smiled and said that in the day i chose she had some lessons to take but she said we will discuss that on messenger tonight... And she left.. After school i waved at her in messenger but she didn't even seen it from about 2 hours now so guys... DID I FUVK UP? Or should i try again? I know feel a mixture of awkwardness and being heart broken... Did she just said that so she don't hurt my feelings? Pls be honest with me.. EDIT :it's all over know.... She responded and we spoke a little then she said she's into someone else and she don't exactly know and she said we will still be friends... this clearly ends it... Doesn't it? But my close girl friend(i ve known her for 11 years) told me that girls say that when they don't like a guy... And she told me to move on... And try to forget her(but it's hard to..)  #128532; i just want to thank all the awesome people that tried to help but it's too late now...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in my country the prices are different it is more expensive exp this build costs about 400$ if you convert it to tnd(Tunisian dinar) it will normally be 1127tnd but..when i calculated all the parts it costs more than 2000 TND that's why i really can't add anymore the 65$ will be about 250-300 tnd p.s don't think i am being scamed because the prices are all the same across all the country so conclusion is if i bought it from outside it will cost me about 1200tnd but here it will cost me 2000+ tnd</TEXT>

    <TEXT>try to get him to understand that you doesn't want to and in my opinion for your own sake you should refuse there are many scientific researchs prove that anal sex is bad for women health (think about it his penis will be connected to your stomach which can surely cause diseases) try convincing him with science tell him it is so painful (for the first time you will hate it (i don't think you will ever"Physically"enjoy it if you ever watched a video about anal you've probably seen actresses faking enjoyments)) he may accept since you said you've been 8 years together and i am sure he loves you as much as you do but there is no doubt he will keep watching those weird videos (why would someone shit herself for money I don't really get it). but if he keeps insisting either you break up with him cause obviously he thinks about you as a "self pleasure" ""thing"" because anal unlike normal sex is only enjoyable from one side and it is his.. does he like having nomal sex ? if so it indicates that he is not a "freak" and can be convinced he just wants to try something he were told or believed is better than vaginal. i also suggest a therapist if he keeps insisting what so ever. i am a male i never tried anal and i would never want to i am speaking if other people's own experience and science articles.</TEXT>

Don't tell me it can't be pirated because that is really retarded. in 2020 everything can be pirated now i already now someone who have a whole pirated console with free games it just you got to use an older version and then easily jail break it then you got a whole full library of games ready to det downloaded ofc i am against that but just saying it is stupid doing that and its more stupid to think about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>for some reason your not allowed to ask questions in the other subreddit so i ll just rrpost here: i am planning on buying a model s soon and I'd like to ask some questions I've never owned a tesla and i barely know anything about them. 1: is it possible to have your own charging station at your garage? 2: i read that it can take up to 12h to fully charge is this true? 3:how long does a fully charged tesla last? 4: for tesla owners how well is the auto drive and the summon feature that calls your car and let's say i am in a fairly crowded location with cars coming back and forth will it be able to navigate itself in the traffic successfully? 5: will i be able yo use it as a off roader( nothing crazy things like driving it on the beach mountain like areas such as going camping or hiking)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>babies don't know what fear is that's probably why you didn't feel anything talking to whoever creature you were talking to. another fun fact (or creepy fact) on ancient Egypt they used to bury dead people with their dead cats so evil spirits don't disturb them they also say that cats, dogs, wolves, horses, and roosters are able to see spirits it's not really of a fact but a lot of people believe in it including me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont know man but these are definitely evil spirits it can't be a coincidence if it happens that many times you must take the necessary steps as fast as possible they are getting comfortable in your house since you said they started moving the light thing probably because they don't want you to see them just yet but they won't wait tonight they started moving and following possibly magic by someone or something demonic like a decoration or someshit thay seems normal but it's summoning them idk but one thing i know that a friend of mine started seeing characters in his house and more started showing he used those arabic spells things and it really worked he said, what you gotta do is use [this](https://youtu.be/rs4IaodRAho) and put it on a speaker and set the volume on a level when it reaches all the house and leave the house to do your things he said it is important to leave the house while the process is working and hopefully it will work i don't know man i don't completely believe in this shit but a lot of people said it worked good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nothing really I can't really remember the month but it was at the start of the summer like June-july the time was close maybe, i can remember that the first encounter happened pretty late something like 11pm-12am and yesterday it happened at 11:20pm i believe so i don't think there is a obvious pattern not one am aware of at least but the one thing that is certain that it reappeared in the exact same spot of the 1st encounter and when i was sitting in the same sofa of the first encounter so my guessing is maybe it thinked that it would be "funny" to reappear under the same circumstances just to spook me and it did i've never been terrified like that in a long time i Surely don't want it to happen again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Planning on building a pc (Ryzen 5 2600X ,16gbRam 3200 , RTX 2060 super or equivalent) i already bought the ram and the cpu and the case now saving for the mobo and psu and graphics card (waiting for black Friday) and i am on a budget so i was thinking i don't really need Ray tracing and there is always cheaper and better amd cards so what's the equivalent of an rtx 2060 super with 8G of v ram? also is it worth it going amd ? Nvidia Pros: GeForce Experience cool features Ray tracing AMD Pros : Better Gpus at the same or lower price. What's you thoughts guys? Edit: forgot to mention one of my friends said that he can give me his 8months 1070Ti for a very low price (100$) this will save me a lot of money</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What have i done wrong ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-04 19:41:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>last week i met this girl in a friend's birthday (we met cause my friend told me she has a crush on me) we spent all the night talking to each other and i started liking her (i would say me too i eventually made a crush on her) we exchanged numbers and everything went fine. everyday for the last week we were texting and sending snaps to eachother for hours we even made plans for a couple of dates in the future it was all great. yesterday it was our first "date": it barely lasted an hour (not because it was boring) we ate something and talked a bit than she suggested we go to a roof top i thought something interesting was going to happen (didn't want or expect nothing that crazy tho maybe our first kiss that's all) we spent like 20 mins on that roof and she spent them talking to the phone to her friend about picking her up later she didn't want to go so early but her friend couldn't come later so she apologized and left. i was kind of sad and so disappointed. later that night she didn't respond to my texts (she used to always almost reply instantly when i text her) i can't understand what happened wrong ? what did i do wrong?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RDR2 story expansion dlc ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 12:40:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>like what the last of us did in left beyond maybe a dlc that takes place maybe at the childhood of Arthur or dutch and the start of the rivalry with the O'Driscolls and what happened at blackwater it may be a good idea to finish the series i read that it's unlikely for a rdr3 to happen and it's for the better i feel like the story is finished and dragging it out would ruin it also anything about rdr2 undead nightmare? P.S: another small question guys about the badges like i see people with characters next their name how does this work ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you can when you commit "stupid" crimes (i often accidentally choke someone instead of riding my horse xD) you can defuse him and he will pretend that he didn't see you but about the fast travel i don't use it anyways in any game i like to explore the world probably and i enjoy the long rides so i can have more road encouters and stangers i only use it when i am like at valentine and want to go to Anne'sberg that's pretty long ride i also use it when i want to quickly do a side mission before it disappears except that if you got the time i highly recommend you explore more you'll find a lot of road encouters bad and good you will save people, get robbed , help people and gain honour donate...etc. there are two strangers i believe if you helped them with a snake bite next time you encounter them in a town they wil pay for whatever you get in a gunsmith.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>just gonna add this last thing and leave you be "It is best to treat talk and threats about suicide seriously. Research indicates that up to 80% of suicidal people signal their intentions to others, in the hope that the signal will be recognized as a cry for help. These signals often include making a joke or threat about suicide, or making a reference to being dead. If we do take them seriously and ask them if they mean what they are saying, the worst that can happen is we will learn that they really were joking. Not asking could result in a far worse outcome" p.s: probably your all are just kids seeking attention anyway so it is my bad even trying to advise you when you grow up you'll understand. also when i advice someone about suicide (and i did a lot of times and it helped) am not worried about his life i don't care about him unless he is a friend i care about the lifes of people he'll ruin when he does it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you are completely wrong people don't joke about it to "cope" with it 80% of suicidal people use memes,death posts, hints about being dead to get attention not to "cope" and yes you can joke 'almost' about anything not everything should be funny most importantly suicide i get it at your age it is cool and whatever to say I'll die but trust me when you grow up (when your brain becomes mature) youll see that it is so cringey to see yourself that desperate for attention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>just in case you didn't understand it i am mocking the poster because i was annoyed by these memes and THEY are seeking attention as a cry for help you probably never experienced depression (good for you) when you become depressed in teenagers mostly (because of school results, rejections, lack of friends etc...) they become thinking that no one cares about them, no one loves them so a lot of them go to memes (since it is a very popular concept of sharing opinions) and hopefully people will give them attention BY NOT JOKING about them i ve tried before talking to people like that just talking to them they seem to appreciate it a lot that's the kind of attention they want bit if most comments say things like "same" ,"me too", "i ll fail at both" these people commenting doesn't understand the situation of the poster and he'll get them as "relatable" 'everyone is like me so there is no harm' ( trust me when people get to this point of mental disorders they're logical brain cease to function they are focusing on mostly how to end their suffering by any means speaking of experiencing myself) i made a mistake mocking him in the first place it wasn't my meaning and good that people like you tried to "correct me" wrongly so i was able to see my mistake(hopefully my other comments corrects it) and speakin of other people and down votes i really doesnt care as long as i am doing the right thing so i call it just hate and i can deal with haters all day long.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The story of my life and what Made me FA</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 09:40:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>i grew up in a family with a very religiously strict father (and mother too) he always talked about girls like that taboo subject that you shouldn't talk about even when i was very young and i couldn't even understand the sexuality in relationships then ,this made me even scared to talk to them about a girl i liked i was that kid at school that rejects almost any girly approach and slowly became extremely anxious and shy around any girl untill middle school i was annoyed about it because i always even tho i liked some girl i had that old mentality that made me very scared to approach any.. for a period I really started asking myself if i was naturally gay and if that was the problem with girls(it wasn't) that made me very depressed in that middle school period i LITERALLY had no female friends whatsoever completely NONE for years ...that had a very strong impact on my grades and my parents reactions didn't help at all (i am a gamer but at that time they only allowed me to play on Sunday for a couple of hours even tho before that i had very good grades and that shyness even progressed to make a very introverted person of me so i only had like 4-5 friends and the only way i could've have a what i can call "good time" only in those couple hours of gaming a week when i can play with my friends and feel happy...but when my grades went down my parents thinked that it is that 3-4 hours of fun i had on Sunday so they took that also from me i became more depressed and i even thinked of suicide(at that time i don't blame my past self at all my life really sucked) i couldn't talk to them because i simply was scared of them my parents didn't and still don't believe in depression especially since "i am a male and should be "'strong"" so middle school was by far the worst period of my life. by highschool i already reached that level of staying VERY away from my parents and i hid every single detail of my life from them i tried to make the least contact with them as possible i cooked for myself, made own laundry, found a job to pay my expenses bought my phone, laptop and ps4 with my own money and slowly by then i started feeling happy again i slowly opened up to new friends that taught me how to approach girls and talk to them but that was EXTREMELY hard for me, so basically my friends are those who changed my mentality not my parents, and i improved over the years to overcome my made up shyness and anxiety around girls, i saved up some money and even got a better job at a restaurant and it finally happened i moved out of that house to live by my own in a small 1 room apartment and here comes the only thing i can possibly be grateful to my parents they actually helped me pay the rent and the water/electricity expenses (most months at least) by moving out that was the best decision i made in my entire life yet i am free now even my grades improved a lot i became able to game whenever i want to go out to parties whenever i want to (parties are another thing that my parents banned) i found that going out more helped me getting to know more female friends and improve my social skills but as you can imagine it wasn't easy at all i still even struggle socializing now but it only improving for the better. so in my case (not trying to flex) i am gratefully not ugly and i happily have a lovable personality so my parents were the main reason that made me FA for 15 years of my life what i am trying to say here is to tell people to stop blaming yourselves and try to think of what other impacts in your life that made you what you are RN and i see a lot of people here say that they are ugly that's why..i can understand that but i believe that no one is ugly everyone is beautiful in their own way think of other reasons and don't blame yourself (unless ofc you are wrong) . i decided to post this here to try and give people hope and try somehow to help them with what i struggled with and see if there is any similar experiences. EDIT: Another Really important thing i forgot to mention: working out also can keep you busy and help you feel a lot better about myself so it is a necessary step fo your physical health and mental health.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Huawei y9s vs samsung a51(or a50s)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-04 10:27:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>i am currently using a Huawei mate 10 lite (my first Huawei phone all the previous ones were Samsungs) and its a pretty decent phone for it's price but it's time for a change i got my eyes on the Samsung a 51 or a50s both in my currency are 850-900 it's considered a bit expensive but they are both pretty good phones from a trustworthy brand i ve been with for years but when the y9s came out it was stunning with 6gb ram and 128gb stock for the base model and for 650 in my currency + that cool sliding camera my question is : they are both almost the same at specs but what makes the Huawei cheaper ? and which phone should i go for ?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-05 08:33:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>yesterday was one of my best friend's birthday i forgot about it (i always do I rely on social media to remind me about events like this) i didn't wish him a happy birthday and I didn't come to his party even tho he invited me in short video on Instagram along with other people and there the problem gets bigger he was posting stories about people wishing him so you say "so you knew?" nope because he always posts memes in his story i got used to it and i was already like just passing through people stories not conscious about their content so i swiped passed it and didn't notice it. now back to today it is my birthday the first message i got was his wishing me happy birthday you can imagine how embarrassing and awkward it was I couldn't respond i am so ashamed to do i couldn't just say thank you and pretend that i don't care and I can't say "yeah sorry i forgot to wish you and come to your party even tho i technically saw the stories" i am stuck here i know he is a good person he will probably forgive me but i can't stop feeling bad for him and myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes exactly the xbox is already more powerful than the ps5 so sony isnt competing in hardware they arr giving the games, the software, and the games also i am speaking as a normal gamer who just wants to play games (exp: i saw gears 5 looks like a decent game then i need am xbox) now if i liked gears 5 i can play it on my pc so aside from xbox fans an ordinary guy will unlikely go for the xbox + no matter how powerful the series x it won't surpass pc so if someone is looking for performance pc is the best option. anyways i don't really care about both companies which gives the best games i will go for it in this situation xbox has no games i was just confused how Xbox want's to win the console war.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's NOT a bad thing my point is (speaking of myself) : i am a pc gamer originally when i buy a ps4 for a example i invested a lot in a reasonable price for a console that i can play on: god of war, the last of us ,spider man, horizon, shadow of the Colossus,ghost of Tsushima, death Stranding (before it came to pc) and much more that i can only play on ps ... so again my point is am no way against xbox being very customer friendly and giving options i wanted to see what people think about xbox changing their strategy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>how is that ? you can play every single game made on pc ps games are the hardest to cause there is no proper ps4 emulator there is a Nintendo emulator lets you play breath of the wild on your pc and xbox, Microsoft made it easier by releasing their exclusives to pc so if you have a decent pc you can play any game you want at your performance preference + mods pc is the ultimate gaming platform that is the truth sony stays at the second place because again there is no ps emulator and what there is only runs ps1/2/3 games so ps4 and ps5 have a special position conclusion is 2200$ will make you able to play every single game out there . (1700$ is what my pc costs + the possible 500$ of the ps5 + a bonus every year or two you can sell your old hardware save a bit and upgrade to the latest to always stay up to date and play every single game out there that's an investment worth taking).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sure it does but that depends on the person and his situation in my situation i already got the pc for said a Decent price so ofc i won't buy an Xbox on the other hand if i don't own a pc i will ofc go for a series x/ps5 there also a other section of gamers which are casual games like adults who don't have time to play much so a console is a good choice it really depends on the person in the end</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it was never better in price but in performance i guarantee you next year Nvidia will drop the RTX 3000 series and it will stay Better in my opinion if you save for a couple of months or even a year and get a high end pc is more worth it than staying 6 years with the same hardware that it's performance decrease every year.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-05 11:16:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>in this dream i saw me and my friend (who is very arachnophobic btw if that helps) going to a place to study i believe so when we entered it was a giant place inside with a staircase to the roof amd in the end of that hall there was a pile of giant bones kind of arranged but squished together into a pile then it turns out it was a gigantic skeleton spider with a skull very similar to the predator's skull my friend i was advanced up ahead of my friend so he ran out and closed the door scared i assume, i had to start running up the long staircase that seemed endless while the spider is climbing behind me i somehow made it but there was no way out buy jumping or climbing down (the building wasn't that high from the roof not like the staircase maybe 4 floors?) i started to climb down but the spider eventually catches me and brings me back inside then here comes the weird part he said something i couldn't remember but it was so funny that i woke up feeling this (the kind of feeling you have after you laugh so hard about something) and no i don't believe he was tickling me lol ,and then he ate me. is there an explanation for this ? also i want to add that i wasn't terrified like waking up from a nightmare as i said i woke up kind of happy... edit: the laughing part was confirmed my mom said she heard i was giggling..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. will it work with my PCIe 3.0 MB and if it doesn't what are my cheapest mb options 2. will my 2600 CPU be enough or at least close enough to match the new gpu (i cant afford any new CPU i am already saving all for the RTX3070 so even if it will bottleneck a bit thats alright for now i will upgrade the CPU in the future ) 3. i have 550 PSU do i need to upgrade 4. in my case i have the standard 3 front fans and 1 rear fan will this be enough to cool the gpu and CPU cause i saw in the representation that hot air of the gpu will go directly to the cpu intake fan so i am worried about that thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>just finished ep5 of s9 it was great honestly but am very upset about rick "just leaving" like that i mean they confirmed that the show will end with season 11 so why don't they just keep him in the series less waiting for the movies at least. the movies about him don't even have a release date it's at least a couple years ahead for the first movie..so are they just going to leave him "to be continued" for years ? don't get me wrong the idea of thrilling us and the excitement of seeing him again is great but they really should've kept him till the last season. am i the only that thinks like that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Case fan recommendations?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-16 09:36:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>i am kind of lost choosing case fans i currently have a 5 pack of uphere fans they are not bad but they are not that good either (got them for 18$ lol) they are noticeably loud when you install multiple ones of them and not so great airflow, since i am planning on getting one of the new 3000 series airflow is very important to keep the cpu cool. so my questions here should i upgrade to a liquid cooler and solve the cpu problem (i have the same noctua that Linus featured on his liquid vs air video and it's very good ) or you can suggest me case fans that are not very expensive and sufficient (priorities: noise and airflow ,price, 5 fans replace).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>liquid cooling will solve this https://images.app.goo.gl/F5rN1pBY95nUyLyh8 , if i pu the radiator in front or even on the top the intake will not be impacted by the gpu hot exhausted air that will go straight inside the cpu cooler. and i was using black and white rgb theme in my case removing the fans rgb will impact the aesthetics of the build aren't there any good silent rgb ones ? all what i ve seem got noise complaints</TEXT>

    <TITLE>About the ending of gow 3 and 4</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-20 10:58:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>i never played gow 3 but i know that he impaled himself with the Olympus sword but how did he survive ? assuming he is unable to die how is that ? since he killed god's physical forms why he's immune to death ? another point is that i also know that he killed both the gods related to death and underworld (forgot their names) so he cannot be held dead and can always reclaim his soul? now back to gow 4 in the end when they reach the giants mountain he sees a picturing of Atreus and him dying? while Atreus is either singing or trying to save him by transferring his life to his father. also the moment when atreus said loki i thought about Norse mythology and the events of 'Ragnarok' which include a long winter which lasts approximately 3 years (remember Atreus saying he would sleep all winter? the they battle thor in a vision?) but also include loki (atreus) leading a army of the dead to the end of the world but that mustn't necessary be true cause the game is always a bit changed on the mythology in which loki is the main cause of by killing baldur which is supposedly a very popular and lovable guy in mortals and Ragnarok starts by loki killing him. so what do you think will happen? also some people speculated that the world serpent is actually kratos reanimated by loki ?? this explains why he is in the cover of the game , when th serpent said about loki"he looks familiar" , why he has pale a beard (more like goatee) and some red scales mirroring kratos tattoo and also his friendly behaviour towards atreus and kratos and hatred towards thor which is connected to the vision atreus saw of kratos and thor battling. also another good point i missed that is one of the main events of ragnarok is thor slaying the world serpent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you love your job then there is nothing wrong with it but the family thing is not totally possible humans are social animals so at some point in the future most your friends will be busy with life and won't have that much time to spend with you so you'll probably feel lonely and even depressed at some point + it's always good to have someone you care about and they too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's not a 'press the button' thing , for a good healthy relationship with someone you need to get to know them first and try living with them and if you both go along with each other then you can move forward (it took some people up to 8 years to decide so) so you'll need time progressing it ,also as you get older your chances of finding someone will lessen over time. and loving someone is nothing negative it will only make your life better , with somebody in your life you'll always find someone who is willing to listen to your problems and try to help you, laugh at your jokes, supports you mentally and financially. so my advice is to look for that person you'll find plenty looking too and try to progress with them if you don't already have. with the right person you are not losing anything really so if you do find that someone you'll never regret it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice about covid 19..</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-12 14:02:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>so in the past 2 days i had a mouth sore in the top end of my mouth (behind my ear) that's the first symptom , also in the past 2 days i ve been sneezing more often than usual and a couple coughs , i feel weakness and some parts like my waist, back and head hurt and now i am pretty sure that i am getting a fever soon since am feeling cold. i already Googled these symptoms all i got is the same as an ordinary cold so i can't tell if it's cold or covid, also every year around this time i always get sick because of the sudden temperature changes in my region. so if there anyone here who got it and recovered or dealed with it , did these symptoms happened? i always wear a mask and try to wash my hands very often so i really hope it's not covid. thank you.</TEXT>
