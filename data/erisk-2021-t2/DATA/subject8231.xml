    <TEXT>I never went out of my way to try these planes and has happened more by chance but living in Australia we have a lot of newer planes with great variety. That #8217;s also why I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll ever get to fly a 757, A340 ect. I have never felt unsafe on an airplane but there is always that thing in the back of the mind. I generally just put it into perspective by thinking I #8217;m more likely to die driving to and from the airport.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>US domestic first class and international premium economy is generally a seat like economy that is wider, with more recline, more leg room and sometimes a foot rest. International first class is generally a very large seat that converts into a flat bed and meets up with a stool at the feet to form the end of the bed when fully reclined. When the seat is not reclined that stool can be used by someone else if you want to say share a meal sitting across from each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I met him when he came down to Australia for a show. I got really worried about what he would be like in reality (mainly due to Reddit) but he was actually fantastic. At the end of the show he set aside more time to answer children #8217;s questions when you could see the other presenter trying to wrap him up. Even after the other presenter finally said out loud  #8216;ok we really need to end up #8217; NDT kept saying  #8216;oh ok just one more #8217;. I reckon he answered at least another 5 of the kids questions. He honestly looked like he would be happy to sit there all night answering them.</TEXT>

This really hit home for me, my mum has had what looks like the same spinal fusion into her pelvis as well as 2 titanium discs (her xrays look pretty cool). We have always joked that when she dies and is cremated she #8217;ll just be a pile of dust and metal. This for some reason made me feel weird, like I was looking into the inevitable future. Although I always pictured shiny metal for some reason but this makes more sense. Thanks for your post and a bit of a hit of reality.</TEXT>

Unfortunately she thinks she has bad acne (it seems pretty normal to me, a few spots every now and then) so she gets really sucked into stuff like the posted book. She is normally a really rational and analytical person but when it comes to her skin she will clutch at anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why does it make her dumb? She bought a book. She got conned like millions of other people who buy into marketed bullshit on false promises and claims. She is smart, rational and analytical person who doesn #8217;t work in food or science and isn #8217;t really interested in science or skepticism either and obviously didn #8217;t know any better. These books are marketed and presented as legitimate sources of information and she got fooled. I #8217;m not making fun of her at all, in fact it actually opened up a conversation about the book. I told her I #8217;m posting it on reddit and she didn #8217;t care because she also saw the comedy in the fact that there were 2 polar opposite books sitting next to each other on the table. Not everyone on reddit wants karma, I enjoy seeing what people post and I hope others enjoy or find interesting what little I post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not sure but I can give you a little slice of where ALP lost it for the people in my friendship group. We are all around 30 and live in Melbourne. Most of us agreed with the vast majority of ALP policies, apart from negative gearing and capital gains tax policies. Pretty much all of us said the same thing, if it wasn #8217;t for those 2 things we would be voting labor. The problem was that most of us have a home or an investment property (whilst renting where we want to live) with plans to hopefully buy another in the future or really just have options with our existing properties. The possibilities of losing those options and even the possibility of rent increases for those of us renting basically swung the majority of people in our group. We #8217;re not backwards Queenslanders, we #8217;re not racist bigots, we #8217;re not religious nutters. We believe in climate change (some of us very strongly), 2 of us are teachers and 3 of us are even construction workers in the union. But those policies are what swung us away from labor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s the reality of the situation. Mind you I wouldn #8217;t say we are all wealthy. None of us have more than one property, some of us live in that house or rent it out and rent somewhere else our selves. We all worked hard, saved, some of us started business and only now are most of us starting to earn above average full time wage. Many of us didn #8217;t want to risk further house price falls due to policy (some only bought recently and their houses are now already worth less). Some were worried about rents increasing and yes others who maybe were already planning to buy another property in the next few years just didn #8217;t want to loose thousands a year not being able to claim expenses (which you can do on any other investment). Also if they ever want to sell an investment it will have cost them probably tens of thousands. We all basically have a vision that we don #8217;t want to have to rely on the pension or an ever dwindling superfund. Property has been a good stable way to do that for generations. They went big and underestimated how many people care about their own finances and future financial ambitions. Especially when people have legitimately worked hard, been frugal and saved for years to buy a house. I #8217;m not here to judge (tbh I donkeyed because I was so torn) I #8217;m just answering the question as to what I saw failed with labor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every American goes on about how big Texas is, yeh maybe in comparison to other US states or countries in Europe but the world is a much bigger place. I mean it #8217;s not even America #8217;s largest state (that would be Alaska which is over double the size). I #8217;m Australian and laugh at reading or hearing about how long it takes to drive across it (obligatory  #8216;you can drive all day and still be in the same state #8217;). Texas is smaller than 5 out of the 7 states and territories we have and by a fare long shot as well, I mean WA is over 3 times larger. Do you know where Texas rates in size among the world #8217;s state and territory sizes? 26th! I #8217;m sorry Americans it #8217;s just not that big a place.</TEXT>

Just like when you compare Texas to other states or territories around the world it #8217;s not very big. Let me put it this way if you put it on a scale of 1 to 10 with the smallest state in the world (by km2) being a 1 and the largest in the world being a 10 Texas is about a 2.</TEXT>

This is about comparing apples with apples or in this case states and states. The Texas is a large US state, it #8217;s not that big compared to the world #8217;s biggest states. It being big is your perspective. To someone living in a large Russian state or in Western Australia it would be small. To get rid of the perspectives compare it to everything in that category. Texas is about 1/5th the size of the worlds largest state or territory, It ranks high but in pure size terms it #8217;s much closer to the smallest states in the world than to the largest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started playing FH4 about 5 months ago, after loving FM7, and enjoyed it much more than I expected to. After making a fair bit of effort the last months to get over 80% (it #8217;s hard with long hours at work and my gf not being a fan of how much I can hog the TV) I now find myself dreading the online seasonal events. TBH I have been lucky, I generally get through them first or second go and try to be a team player. I finish usually top 3 or 4, unless I massively cock it up or get knocked out of a checkpoint by another player. I know I could just not do them but I really wish there was another way to getting some of the rarer cars at 80%. It #8217;s frustrating me and making me feel like playing the game is more of a chore than enjoyable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. Holden held a very special place in a lot of Australians. It was our car, especially the commodore, which from 2006 onwards was completely designed and engineered here (apart from the V8s engines). Most Australians grew up with a Holden commodore (or ford falcon) as their family car. Holden was the number one selling car brand here for many decades, up until 2010. It #8217;s sort of bittersweet because once they stopping making Holdens here and started wholly importing inferior products their sales slumped massively. It needed to happen but it #8217;s still sad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I agree that it definitely was a marketing issue that sunk them, the cars they were importing were nothing special and although the commodore and astra were good and drove better than most of the competition, they were not segment leading. The ZB, why would you buy it over mazda 6 or VW passat? The Arcadia? Plenty of better SUV competition from other brands. Even the Colorado, why buy one over a Ford Ranger or Amarok. The cars they were importing felt cheap inside and out and I don #8217;t think appealed to buyers, they certainly didn #8217;t to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes but what I #8217;m saying is that a soldier does not go out and invite the enemy to his home or local area, which is what this has the potential of doing. The people who went to the protest do not live in bubbles. Some may do the right thing and isolate for 14 days and get tested if they have symptoms, many have not. I agree that people should be getting tested but unfortunately (here in Melbourne anyway) they have become somewhat strict again and are only testing if you show symptoms, which could be too late.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I run a business, If one of my staff members does something wrong, I have to take responsibility for it and try to rectify it in someway. I may have not been directly involved in what happened but it is still my problem and I have to take responsibility for it. In a round about way it is my responsibility to have the best people in the company, at any level, to make sure things run smoothly both up and down the chain. Dan did not do this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, unfortunately the VW Amarok has a really bad design where the mirrors only diagonally fold up. When ever some one hits it they snap straight away. I just bought a temporary mirror from Supercheap auto as looking at it this morning there are deep scratches and dints all the way down the car. This will have to be an insurance job.</TEXT>
