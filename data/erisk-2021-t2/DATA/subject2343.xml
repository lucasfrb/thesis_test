    <TITLE>I lost my favorite person.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-04 06:32:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to know this guy. He was actually my boyfriend, my long distance boyfriend. He lived in California and I lived in Kentucky. I never connected with anyone like I did with him. I felt like I could always talk to him, I never had that with anyone else. Other people always just seemed like they didn't have time to talk to me or didn't really want to. When I was with my "friends" and they were talking to each other and basically ignoring me I could always pull my phone out and he'd make me feel better. We talked pretty much all the time. I really loved him and just like pretty much everything about him. But of course, I'm not fucking allow to be Happy in my life and have connections with people like that, because he broke up with me for some stupid disgusting bitch that no one in his family even likes. like we talked about her before we started dating and he said he liked her and he had asked her out and she said no several times. I guess she didn't want him until he was already taken. She's also been arrested for domestic abuse so yeah. It really hurts he would leave me for someone like that, mostly just because she's closer. I thought we had this great connection. I was going to move to California to be with him because I didn't have anyone here. He was everything to me. also as if it wasn't bad enough that he broke up with me he completed blocked me on everything so I can't even talk to him anymore. I miss him so much I can't stand it sometimes. I just wish we could talk again. I don't even care about dating him anymore. it's been a few months and I still think about him a lot. I tried talking to other people but no one is like him. I feel so empty. I don't think I'll ever find anyone that I connected with like I did with him. I'm sorry the grammar and wording is really bad. I used my phones talk to text thing to write this because I'm tearing up pretty bad. The friend's I did have don't really talk to me anymore because I guess I became a bummer after my boyfriend left me. I just really wanted to get this off my chest.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Creepy Town ideas?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-04 19:08:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always wanted to have a creepy town but I've never been able to pull it off. I have two towns. One called Rose Bay, it's pretty boring just being Rose themed and all. My second town is called Landres and it's color themed. the town in section off in each section has its own color. The black section of Landres is gonna be the creepy section but like I don't have a lot of of ideas. Of course I should fill it with dead trees but what else should I do? I'm going to try to put a creepy house there it's like a prison in the basement with a mannequin dressed up like a lady in it and then another character in a different section of town will talk about how his sister is missing. What do you guys think what are some creepy things I can doo???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I check my phone a lot to see if I got a message or a notification or something. It's weird I know there's nothing on it because I would of heard it, but I still check. There's hardly ever anything. And usually when there is it's empty shit like " lol" or " yeah" or " #128577;". but my favorite is when my phone buzzes and I pick it up and it's just my phone telling me that the battery is dying.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Social anxiety?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-05 18:15:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a hard time talking to people. I feel like there's this wall. I crave social interactions and companionship, but I tried to look into new people and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. It's like I want to have friends and maybe meet a nice guy one day but I can't ignore that feeling. I don't even know what it is. I feel like maybe I don't want to disappoint people And also I don't want to be disappointed. Like I'm afraid of getting hurt or hurting people if the relationship doesn't work out. I've been like this my whole life but it seems like it's just getting worse. I've always wanted to be the kind of person who has a bunch of friends. But when more than one person is texting me I feel really overwhelmed. Sometimes I just really hate the way I am and I wish I was different. I see people with lots of friends who have no problem talking and making new ones. I don't understand why I have to be like this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I thought we had plans.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-08 12:23:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>My friends invited me to go with them to a bar at around Christmas. I told them I would and we had a plan so I thought. Soo during the wait my boyfriend broke up with me, I was pretty upset but I still wanted to go out with my friends because I thought it would make me feel better. The day came and they said they couldn't go because the bar they wanted to go to was closed near Christmas. One day I was hanging out with one of them and apparently they did go out that night without me. They just didn't go to that particular bar. They hang out without me a lot but this time it hurt my feelings a lot more because they invited me. I think it was because my boyfriend dumped me and they didn't want me ruining the mood. My one friend said that they just wanted to keep things small but like I was the only one not invited to the new plans. I don't really talk to them anymore now. So I don't really have any friends anymore, And honestly I haven't noticed much of a difference.</TEXT>

And instantly a thought pops up like " the bitch deserved it" and that's like some of the tamer shit. A lot of the time it's like horrible disgusting things that are just appalling. As soon as I process the thought I shake my head and tell myself to stop, and not to think that. It's like my mind is always trying to think of ways to make me feel disgusted in myself . I'm alone a lot so naturally I spend a lot of time with these thoughts. They aren't as bad as they used to be but I was just wondering are they normal??</TEXT>

Idk if they were bad friends or if it's something I did. They ruined a lot of other opportunities I had to make friends too. I think it's kind of shity to be so obsessive over someone and then barely speak to them yourself. Whatever I'm better off without them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this morning I finally had enough initiative to take a shower. I got in and started washing when for whatever reason I started thinking about my ex boyfriend. I was remembering what it was like and how perfect he was for me. It's not fair how I wasn't enough for him. Honestly I don't know if I'll ever be able to find someone like him. He really was everything I could ever want and no one , fucking no one is even remotely like him. I miss him so much. It makes me sick I have no idea what's going on with him.... But yeah... I was in the shower and I just cried. I cried for a while. I couldn't even let it all out cause my mom was in the living room. So it was a painful forced silently cry. Feels good to have to when I have these strong emotions after so long of nothingness, I guess. I just wish I could have a positive one every one and while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the past few months I've been really upset about my ex leaving me. I don't know if this has anything to do with it but I recently started exercising. But around the same time the feelings of sadness and longing have turned to angry and resentment. before when I thought about if he ever message me again how happy I'd be and how we had like this great reunions. Now all I can think about is telling him how disgusting he is and if you wants to talk to me he can wait until I feel like it. Idk if this is a sign of recovery or if I just snapped. Honestly I'd rather be sad then angry. I mean it feels better to be angry but I don't like the way it makes you act... You know?</TEXT>

And when I woke up I could tell it was a real song but the details we're bleeding from my brain like water through a colander. And I literally couldn't remember anything about it within seconds. It's really frustrating because I want to listen to the song again but I don't know anything about it anymore, just that it was a really good song.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like most pokemon appear in the overworld already right? So they already have most of the models for it. And they are cutting out Pokemon not found in the galar Pokedex so they don't have to worry about making the models for them. I just don't understand why Pokemon can't follow you. It's really disappointing to me. And if Pokemon could follow you, it would make accepting that Pokemon not in the Galar dex easier for me and probably a lot of others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally think it's going to be generation 4. I think they're going to do a remake for generation 4 and make a lot of its Pokemon unavailable in sword and shield. Thus, Giving you another reason to want to play the remakes. Other than that I think generation 5 it's going to have a lot of cuts because it trends to be the black sheep of the Pokemon games. Obviously all the Gen 1 Pokemon are safe, because they always get special treatment. Idk what do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I hate my mother.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-15 10:34:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>This story is kinda painful, but I wanted to get it off my chest. So, One day when I was about 16 my mom woke up on a Sunday morning to go to church with her and my father, like they did every Sunday. I hated it, and I told them everytime I didn't want to go with them, but they forced me, everytime.It was extremely boring and something I would fall asleep because I didn't sleep good as a teen. I did it all the time but for reason my mother was particularly upset about it that day. She started telling me about how they are ashamed of me, and how when I do that it embarrasses them. The usual shit. At this point it didn't effect me. I stopped caring about what they thought of me a long time ago, but then she said " If you're Grandpa was still alive today, he would be ashamed of you too." And I don't know why but that hurt me. I knew it was bullshit, I knew she didn't know what she was talking about but it hurt me, and the only reason she said it is because she knew it would. And told her to not to talk about him. It was just disrespectful. I told her she had no right to say something like that or even talk about him to me. She just kept saying it was true though. Like that was the point. Eventually I told her to shut up. Which is something I never do. Seriously it was the first and only time. I guess I had always been afraid before but damn it was that mad. She starts scream about how disrespectful I am and starts demanding an apology. I tell her if anyone should apologize it should be her. And of course she find this ridiculous because "she didn't do anything." "The things she said were true so she doesn't have to apologize" I don't apologize.I stop talking while they're both barking for an apology, while we drive home. Later when we were home they forced me out of my room into the kitchen and just kept saying "apologize" "you need to apologize to her" " apologize to me right now" over and over. She kept say "look at me" "look me in the eye when you do it."and I looked at her like she wanted and then she slaps me across the face. And screams " don't you dare look at me with that hatred in your eyes." Then followed with about 40 minutes of trying to force an apology out me. Then I just gave up, I just wanted to get away from these fucking people so badly I forced out the most painful apology I had had to muster in my life. I felt horrible after it. Absolutely horrible. I didn't eat for the next few day just because I couldn't stand to look at them. I made a lot of cuts on my thighs and shoulders. Just to try to do something with this horrible horrible feeling. The feeling of having no control at all. To this day she has never apologized and sees nothing wrong with the way she acted. She acted like nothing even happened the second she got her fake apologize, and that was the day I really started to hate her. TLDR: I felt asleep in church, my mother told me my grandpa would be ashamed of me. I told her to shut up, she slaps me and makes me apologize instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's disgusting how easy it is to keep conversations going when I'm drunk. I can Only do it when I'm drunk though apparently. Like People actually respond to my messages and I don't feel weird at all. Why can't I just be like that all the time? How can something be so easy one second then impossible the next? It's just so frustrating to think about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stop acting like you fucking care about me, stop pretending you understand. It's be a lot easier on my head honestly. My mom is worried about me during my breakdowns when my arms are bleeding uncontrollably and I can't stop yelling and crying, but when I'm quite and I don't have the energy to do things I'm faking, I'm disrespectful, I'm a disappointment, I'm nothing like my sister. I'm worse than my brother. I'm embarrassing the fucking family. Seriously just leave me the fuck alone if you really think all that. Stop telling me you want to help me because clearly you don't. You just don't want me to embarrass you anymore, and you know I can do that if you want to, you don't have fucking talk to me, you don't have to fucking calm me, you can tell everyone I've fucking dead for all I care. Because I can't just stop being the way I am for your convenience, I wish I could but it's not that easy......... I'm sorry this probably doesn't belong here but I need to vent and God I fell so lonely right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I care about my hair so much and I do so many things to make it healthy and look better but it just seems like no matter what I do it's always going to look like shit and now I think it's starting to fall out on top of all that. I mean I wash and condition it every few days because I know it's bad to wash it everyday, I gently brush it everyday. I take vitamins for it. I use stupid shampoos for it that cost morethan the regular ones. I haven't washed it in hot water in six years. I never use hairspray or gel. I've only ever let it air-dry. I've never bleached or dyed it once. Seriously I do all this shit and it doesn't even matter apparently. I guess I just have bad genetics. Lucky me, right? I honestly just want to give up, shave it and wear wigs instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This really cute guy I talk to sometimes like took a bus to live in California today. Like just got up from his life here and left. Crazy. Always I was pretty upset because I sorta like him, we've had sex a few times (I'm gay). I was more jealous though. I was in a long-distance relationship about a year ago with a guy from California. Seriously thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with that guy, but he left me for someone closer. If I could have just left on a bus for California like him we'd probably still be together and I'd be happy, but I couldn't do it. I wish I would have everyday. I just can't believe it was so easy for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So first of all the game doesn't really connect me with anyone during max raid battles, so I pretty much have to do them all myself. The problem is in the five star raids the NPC's keep dying, reviving, and dying again until it kicks me out of the den. Honestly I don't understand why they don't just stay down, they barely help at all. I just really wish they had a better system to connect you to other players for the raid battles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all I don't think Wendy should ever lose sanity because of a dead player. She's extremely comfortable with death and she has a ghostly sister. Player ghosts should not effect her at all. I feel like maybe when Abigail is out you can right-click things to make Abigail haunt them, making Wendy the only character who can haunt things while still alive. I was also thinking maybe when you summon Abigail her flowers leaves behind a stem that stays in Wendy's inventory. And Wendy can right click it to warn Abby of danger. This will respawn Abby turning her back into her flower, however she will be ready to summon again immediately. That's just a few silly ideas I had.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So basically what it does is when you stand near it with at least 50 sanity it will turn sanity into enlightenment, anything lower It won't do anything, but when you stand near it with a high enough enlightenment It will share all crafting knowledge any character around you might have, including character exclusive items, and will remember them after you've crafted it (however you will have to come back to it when you wanna craft more.) The ingredients to make it would be: One iridescent moon lens. (Only craftable by the celestial orb) 10 moon glass 15 moon rock And it's only craftable at the celestial altar. It will not remember blueprint exclusive crafts, but will let you craft them if someone nearby knows them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That reminds me of the first time I ever beat her. Poor beating and battered floatzel was my last Pokemon and was up against Garchomp, I thought it was over, " no way floatzel it's going to outspeed this thing" but then BAM garchomp missed. Then floatzel hit it with an ice beam and BAM critical hit, but it wasn't enough... Garchomp was hanging on by a sliver of health, but lady luck was smiling on floatzel that day, because all our fear of defeat melted away when the text " Garchomp has been frozen" popped up the screen. Floatzel finished Garchomp off with a mighty surf and we finally defeated Cynthia, but you know I was a kid so it all probably wasn't that intense, but that's how I remembered it anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So ever since my boyfriend broke up with me I feel like I don't have anyone I can talk to anymore. He was always there to talk to, he replied to all my message and was just generally easy to talk to. I've never had that before with anyone before. No one was ever so responsive. I guess it made me think he cared, but It was an act of course. Because he cut me completely out of his life the second he found someone better than me I guess, blocked me pretty much everything and we haven't talked since. I wondered for the longest time " how" "how could you possibly do that to someone you claimed to love." I mean I've even talked about it before with him. How badly it hurts for someone to do that to you. He knew how badly it would hurt me but he did it anyway to avoid feeling bad about it or something. It's just easier to completely cut me out. Anyways yeah, so now I feel it extremely hard to make new connections. Nobody uses responsive as he was. I don't click with anyone the same way. I can't get all this stupid things he would say out of my head, And I can't stop thinking about all the ugly shirts he used to wear. I can't move on and he doesn't care because he can and did. So now I'm not sure what to do. I mean it'd be nice to have some closure I guess but I'm not really allow. It's just so unbelievably lonely now. My friends don't really talk to me anymore since I've become such a downer after having my heart broken. My family never really accepted me so I don't have their support. And it's really hard to connect with people over the Internet. I was only allowed to have a taste of thinking someone actually care about me, just so it would hurt all the more when it was ripped away. Anyways. Thanks if you read all this crap I wrote out. As it helps to vent every once in a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea is the staff makes lunar the new home for bosses shot with it. So you can shoot Dfly with it and you don't have to follow her by immediately telelocating yourself right after or having someone wait for her. Shes just there now. The staff would also Teleport the boss to the exact location they need to be for the fight. So like maybe D fly would need to be near the baths to mimic her old fight in a way. And it also just eliminates the need for the focus and 3 purple gems anytime you wanna fight a lunar moon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what to do anymore. I desperately want to move on from my ex. I finally bit the bullet and deleted every picture I had of him and all of our texts, but I think about him now more than ever. Its been like over a year since we dated. I'm so tired. I'm trying so hard, but I just can't . He was the first person that ever made me feel loved and accepted, but then he just abandoned me for someone easier. He was long distance but I still took the relationship seriously. Its just so hard to accept those feelings are gone. He ruined it all, yet i still can't get over him. I should hate him but I can't. I just don't understand. There has to be something wrong with me.</TEXT>

Animal Crossing isn't concretely supposed to be played one way that's why so many people love it. Also if the game designers truly didn't want you to time travel you probably wouldn't be able to do it. Heck in New Leaf Isabelle would do it for you without even having to mess with the internal clock.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Paid for characters theory.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-09 20:44:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So have you ever noticed all the human characters have been free? Even Walter the newest character? It got me thinking, why? You have to pay for characters who have born in the constant rather then being trapped there, characters you theoretically shouldn't be playing as. Wortox, wormwood, and wurt have no need to escape. Maybe paying for them is like a metaphor for the price they paid to help the survivors. Helping the survivors put them on Charlie's radar and now she's out to get them too. So basically if you haven't purchased them yet they're still out there living their lives normally, not Afraid for the things lurking in the dark.</TEXT>

This scientist made like this huge saw that could cut the Earth into two pieces to relieve the pressure and everyone figured two pieces were and better than it blowing up into like millions of pieces. Then we had to escort the saw to make sure it didn't get stuck. We were in groups all over the world so we just had to escort it to the next group. And in my group we had this weird love triangle going on so we had to deal with that while we were escorting it. It was wild. But the saw made it, and I came out on top of the love triangle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1.) The reason wurt is good at resource collecting is because this is no limit to how many merms you can have. 10 merms chopping all night is way faster then maxwell or woody could ever dream of. 2.) The resources merms drop are extremely valuable for her. Fish can make more huts, befriend other merms. Gifted to merm king, held for a little bit of sanity gain, turned into eggs for filler, or turning them into fish masks for your friends. 3.) Bunnymen do not attack wurt nor do catcoons. Its only pigmen. If a bunnyman called you a monster as wurt you were probably holding meat for some reason. 4.) Merms are absolutely not harder to work with. In fact they work longer without getting distracted. Plus they work at night. Merms will only be harder to work with if you're not playing as wurt. Honestly you sound like you have never even played as wurt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So recently I've been thinking about my ex, we dated about 2 years ago. I never loved anyone the way I loved him. Then one day he broke up with me and blocked me out of blue. I miss him a lot even now and I think about him pretty frequently. I wonder if he ever thinks about me? Probably not right.. i mean obviously he doesn't want anything to do with me. I wish we could of just broken up. He didn't have to like cut all ties to me. That shit really hurts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Webber's dad used to keep goats and liked science. He's probably Scottish based on his tamo quote. His mom was either a bad cook or neglectful based on his eating stale food quote. Thats all I know. Now.. If you're looking for theories my thoughts are maybe Webber's dad desperately wanted to get to the constant and in his research accidentally send him instead in some kind of failed experiment. Webber being young, innocent, and naive didn't last long and was eaten by spider. That my idea anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah you'll get way more matches on Tinder if you're looking for guys. I had my Tinder set to everyone for a while but I only ever really matched with other guys. Idk why its like that. But it's the same with all my straight guy friends, they don't get nearly as many matches as I do because they don't look for guys. It's weird. Anyways Tinder itself is a garbage app that doesn't give a shit about any of the people using it so maybe just find a different dating app.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-02 00:57:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I like spending a lot of time Underground in dst. You know what I don't like? Worthless touchstones. A touchstone underground in the darkness is basically useless. You use it and then immediately die to darkness. I thought one time I'll be smart and leave a lantern by all the touchstones. That doesn't work either, you can't pick the lantern up in complete darkness and Charlie will attack you before you even get out of that revive animation. I know what you're thinking "just leave and come back," and yeah I could do that but I shouldn't have to doing that kind of breaks the immersion and also has a chance of making me lose my spot on public servers. All I'm asking for is a small light radius around the touchstone that last for at least a few seconds or make it where a ghost can haunt lanterns to turn them on and off.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gay guys in animation.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-24 00:20:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, recently in animation we've been seeing more LGBT characters. Which is really cool, but have you ever noticed its like mostly lesbians/Bi women? Characters like Korra from avatar, Amity and Luz from owl house, everyone from Steven universe, bubblegum and Marcy from adventure time. Now let's think about gay male characters. So...... there are Willow's nameless parents from owl house and ummm the parents of the main characters friend in the loud house and the cops from gravity falls. Idk maybe I'm probably missing a few but I think the differences are pretty clear. The queer females characters are young, and they also the main / important characters. While queer boys are older and also mostly background characters. I'd like to see a main character or even a secondary character be a gay male, and im NOT saying i wanna see less queer women, I just wanna see some more boys.</TEXT>

Like she used to force me to go to church and this One time I fell asleep during a service and in the car ride home she told me that if my grandfather was still alive he would be ashamed of me. She only said that because she knew it would hurt me, I told her to shut up for the first time in my life and then her and my dad screamed at me for like 4 hours straight demanding that I apologize for tell her to shut up. I told her i wouldn't apologize unless she apologized first. Then she told me she didn't have anything to apologize for. Eventually they finally forced me to apologize my grab my arm and refusing to let go of me until I did it. later that day she straight up slapped me across the face for " looking at her with hatred in my eyes." That actually was the day I started hating her. But yeah I've had a lot of people tell me I deserved it for being disrespectful.</TEXT>

It's supposed to make him more effective at bug catching to give him more of a spider like feel. The bee grants sanity because it would taste sweet to Webber considering it's close relation to honey. Mosquito lowers sanity because they have human blood inside them from biting the survivors. Webber still half human so naturally that would bother him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It honestly depends, I'm not trans so I can't tell you what your feelings mean but I did have similar feelings and I can tell you what mine meant and maybe you can relate. So when I first started to come to the conclusion that I was gay it was really upsetting given my family's and peers views on gay people. And I would think things like " i wish i were a girl so I could be normal " because I couldn't imagine not liking boys it was easier to think that then "why couldn't I just be straight" of course I only thought these things when I was pretty young, I think I was a teenager. But these feelings went away when I became more comfortable with my sexuality.</TEXT>
