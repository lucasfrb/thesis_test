    <TITLE>There is a permanent 1-2 second delay on my melee.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-27 05:10:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this occurs ONLY when there is an enemy in front of me, but when I'm in my Titan and try to melee a doomed Titan or a pilot, it takes an extra 1-2 seconds for the melee to start, which the majority of the time, either causes me to get executed or just take unnecessary damage. Has this happened to anyone else? Is there a fix? I'd appreciate any answers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely one of my favorite weapons; not as bad as some people may say. It's not as good as some other SMGs or supply drop weapons, but it is by no means a terrible gun. It will take some getting used to as its recoil pattern is a little weird, but after taking some time to get a feel for the gun it becomes a monster - at least for me. I would recommend running Rapid Fire, Grip, and Quickdraw or Extended Mags. Hope you like the weapon and good luck getting Dark Matter!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate the fact that you're supposedly trying to help the franchise, but saying each gun kills in the same amount of time is a blatant lie. Sure, the general TTK in this game is around the same window, but an ICR will kill you much slower than a Man O War. Also saying that the confrontations require no skill is a lie because a better playing will have much more precise aim, reaction time, and be able to utilize the movement system to its full extent to win a gunfight. I don't know, it was a nice post; I just got the feeling that it was meant more to hate on the game than actually try to improve the franchise.</TEXT>

Second, you cannot control the fact that people will go negative in a video game. Lastly, you really shouldn't care so much that they're going negative that you make a post about it and complain about something you can solve by pressing a button, and then complain saying people who listen to music to negative. I guess I just have trouble comprehending how this is such a big deal to you when you can easily mute them and accept the fact that people go negative, regardless of whether or not they are listening to music while playing.</TEXT>

The way I found that works best was putting on a weapon that melts at close range, and trying to die near enemies walking the robot. If you want, you could try killing yourself after you stealthily flank behind two people on the robot. Good luck, and keep trying, you WILL complete this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, I'm not at all excited for WW2. It's already been done so many times not only in CoD but in video games. From the gameplay I've seen it doesn't look too appealing. Treyarch is my favorite CoD studio and Black Ops 3 is my favorite game. To me, just the menus and everything feel so good. Just the small feature of being able to play zombies music in the menu is amazing; I also love all the specialists and ah, there is just so much I love. Not to mention there's campaign, multiplayer, zombies, dead ops, free run, nightmares, and the DLC content for MP and zombies. Plus there's Dark Matter, hero gear, 100% and so many things to do in this game. The gameplay also just feels so solid and satisfying to me, so it's going to be very hard to any future CoD game to top BO3 for me:</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anything can happen, but if you use logic, you can come to the conclusion that Treyarch will only make original weapons or add weapons that were in last Treyarch games. Analyze the pattern: every single gun that has been added to BO3 has either been originally made, or used in a previous Teyarch game. Based on this, you can safely assume that they will never add guns that haven't been featured in a past Treyarch game, but have been featured in a previous Call of Duty game. Reading your comments is extremely annoying because you're arguing something you know will never happen for no reason other than what seems like to aggravate. I COULD win the Powerball right now, but I'm very sure that I won't. A rogue meteor COULD collide with Earth right now, but we all know that won't happen. Weapons from exclusively Sledgehammer or Infinity Ward games will NEVER be added to Black Ops 3, so stop typing your fucking annoying comments. Everything else aside, I would absolutely love to laser people to death with the EM1 or hear the popcorn sound of the ASM1 again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>70% of the time of me doing Dark Matter was like this, but after almost a year break of playing I get back on and start going for DM again after about a month. I don't know if I just got WAY better or what, but I didn't have to worry about Chameleon camo anymore. Heck, my final Combat Knife challenge was the Survivor medals. The only tips I can give is to, contrary to popular believe, count your kills and of course play extra cautious when you are one or two kills away. Don't be afraid to even camp in one spot for a super long time if you know it will eventually net you kills. My biggest tip is to play Safeguard. Getting Bloodthirsties in this mode is so easy; all you need to do is lurk around the spawns and it's just stupidly easy compared to other modes. All in all, yes, I had the exact same problem as you, but over time it really did diminish. Good luck on your Dark Matter and never give up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually kind of agree. Whenever I watch any PC YouTuber play an online game, at LEAST once a game it seems like someone on the enemy team gets butt hurt and starts saying they're a hacker or something in the chat. I myself have never played online games on PC, but that is one of the reasons I don't want to. On console, I get hate mail maybe once every like 30-40 games or so.</TEXT>

If I check their stats and see they did the glitch (at least 44 kills with each specialist weapon and 22 with the ability, and then at least 80 specialist weapon kills and 38 specialist ability kills with the specialist they have hero gear on), then I immediately report them both on Xbox and in-game. It pisses me off that they can use something I worked so hard for by doing a dumb glitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not pay to win - its pay to have a chance at getting a weapon that is good. You're not going to suddenly start drastically winning a ton of games or skyrocketing your KD with this gun. Is the gun good? Absolutely, but no, it's not pay to win. The only time CoD has ever been "pay to win" was with that sniper/shotgun in IW called the Proteus or something, where you could directly BUY it by buying the season pass, then proceed to one shot entire teams with it when it was broken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But Gung-Ho only allows you to hip-fire and sprint (unless there is a secret feature I didn't know about), so putting on ELO and Stock, two attachments that require you to be ADS, wouldn't be beneficial. Edit: I'm gonna go do some research because now that I think about it, if you're ready to hip-fire then you should have a faster sprint out time. I never use Gung-Ho so I wouldn't know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But the 15% doesn't make any difference whatsoever because it's a part of his default, unmodded stats. The point of using mods is to increase power strength above the baseline; his baseline is still a number, just listed as 115%. Therefore, the mods are still improving that number labeled as 115%, same as they would with any other Warframe labeled as 100%. It makes no difference since it may say 115%, however it's still his baseline without any mods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I got the game TWO years ago for Christmas and it #8217;s my first FF game. I love KH so I figured I #8217;d try this game out. Instantly I fell in love with the world, the music, the characters and the like. However I recently just started playing today after watching my friend who #8217;s very experienced at the game play it. I dropped the game a while ago and decided to come back. Are there any tips as to what I should be doing in combat or what skills I should be unlocking? I consider myself a hardcore gamer who also tends to be pretty good at games, and I truly want to make the best of this beautiful game, but so far I #8217;m not really picking up on the combat it seems. Any tips for a beginner are very much appreciated; thank you for your time!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve entered the gaming void recently and nothing sounds fun to me, but I #8217;m looking for new games. I really love The Witcher, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Shadow of War, and Breath of the Wild. For Christmas I #8217;m hoping to get Nioh, Dragons Dogma, and Horizon Zero Dawn. Are there any other console games of similar fashion you could recommend? I basically have every platform other than a PC so hopefully I #8217;ll find something that interests me. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I consider myself above average at video games; shooters especially, and I want to love this game but I just suck ass. I haven #8217;t played solo however so maybe that #8217;s why. I have about 3 hours in Duos and 7 in Squads with my only 2 wins being in squads. I realize now that mainly playing squads may not be the best option, but does anyone have any other advice? I just really want to enjoy this game and at the very least be able to win a couple times a day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My younger brother and I are huge Star Wars fans and he has shown interest in getting this game. Now, I consider myself a hardcore gamer, however he doesn #8217;t game much at all. I #8217;ve been wondering if this game can be fully enjoyed solo and by someone who doesn #8217;t play video games much. I #8217;m also wondering how MMO heavy this game is. Is it just talk to person  gt; do quest  gt; get reward or is there a decent story and actual time put into it? I #8217;ve never really got into an MMORPG before but I really want to. I #8217;m sorry if I can #8217;t word my thoughts very well, I just have so many questions and ANY advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was in the same row as The Last Guardian so I #8217;m unsure if this was the one you #8217;re talking about, but both Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War are great. War has the loot. Kingdoms of Amalur has a little dialogue but it #8217;s world is very pretty and the combat is fun. Plus there is loot. Dust: An Elysian Tail is a beautiful 2D side scroller with a fun leveling system and combat, but not really any loot if I remember. Nier: Automata also has a very beautiful world and not too many cutscenes and the combat is extremely fun; there is also a difficulty setting in which you die in one hit if that sounds fun. I #8217;m also looking for the same type of games you are and it seems like there aren #8217;t too many, but I hope I helped in some way.</TEXT>

Sadly, all I see are $60+ auctions of of eBay, so I #8217;m wondering if it #8217;s even a possibility to find him in stores or online at this time, or if there will ever be a new wave of him.

    <TEXT>I recently had my PS4 account locked after attempting to link it to my EPIC account which is also linked to my Xbox account, only to find out if you link it with Xbox then your PS4 account becomes locked until you unlink it. Aside from it being pretty stupid that they give you the option to link it only for it to lock your account and thus requiring you to level up, buy the battle pass, and skins all over again, the MAIN problem is that I can now no longer play on PS4. When I go to unlink my PS4 account, it now says I must contact them to unlink it - which I did, last week. Does anyone know how long it takes them to respond or if they will at all? Thanks.</TEXT>

To access it, go to the Fortnite website (not the Epic Games website) and you should be able to login using your Xbox Live account. Then, it #8217;ll ask you to create an Epic Games account for that one and your Xbox account should be linked. You #8217;ll now have two Epic Games accounts, but I #8217;m pretty sure this is the only way to fix this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently just got back into BO3 and was trying to find a video about the 1.26 patch on 12/11, but all I saw on YouTube was the usual titles in all caps, with the videos consisting of some guy screaming at the top of his lungs asking for likes for the first minute of the video. Basically the typical old clickbait. Does anyone have any suggestions of active BO3 YouTubers who aren #8217;t obnoxious? For reference, my favorite CoD YouTubers are ImMarksman, TheXclusiveAce, and especially S0ur for his very well put together and analytical videos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This may be a bit hard, but I #8217;m trying to replicate the appearance of the Winter Soldier #8217;s armor. I have CROSS cybernetics as that #8217;s the best I could do for his metal arm, but if I use gloves then it covers the metal hand. Meaning, I either have a glove over a metal hand or I have a metal hand while the other is bare, unless you guys know of any way to equip a single glove. Also, if you guys know of any mods that would be good for his suit and mask, I would very, VERY much appreciate it!</TEXT>

I personally love it because it definitely takes more skill to use then most other weapons in the game. It #8217;s body shot damage is piss poor; again, I feel that it more than rewards a skilled player. It is 5 damage off of one-shotting someone with max health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well let #8217;s see, Sophomore year of high school I failed two semester long classes because I had to move and transfer schools and basically a lot of family/personal issues, and life still went on. My first quarter of college I failed a math course because for the first time in my life I had a hard time with it; again, life still went on. I ended up getting the only Japanese award for seniors and then another award when I graduated high school. I #8217;m currently still working on my degree, but the WORST that can happen from failing a course, at least in my experience, is that you learn.  #8220;Failure is only the opportunity to begin again. Only this time, more wisely #8221;. If everything goes south, and you don #8217;t pass, don #8217;t worry. Life will still go on and you can still live a normal, successful life.

Now I know this is a incredibly slim chance that someone who browses Reddit found it, but what #8217;s the harm in trying?

Also, we could meet up to exchange the file or if need be you could ship it to us and I #8217;ll pay the shipping cost. I know it #8217;s unlikely someone found it, but I can hope.

    <TEXT>This show is beautiful. My GF had to move cross country recently so I was pretty scared and she showed me an episode she thought I would like (I didn #8217;t watch the show at the time). It was the one with the song Comet; Greg #8217;s line  #8220;And I know deep down in my heart I, have nothing to fear #8221; made me cry tears of joy knowing everything will be okay..and it is.</TEXT>

It can end up being pretty grinding, but games like that to me are fine so long as the gameplay is fun, and Monster Hunters gameplay is definitely fun. The devs are constantly releasing several events a month with a new monster at least what seems like every month or so, and a big event every 2-3 months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh trust me it can be a bitch to play for the first time. I was constantly getting pushed around and could never get a hit or two in before getting smacked in the face. The best advice I can give is try out ALL fourteen weapon classes and see which on you like best. They all play differently and you might be more successful than the on you #8217;re already using. Just keep at it and you #8217;ll get better. Try watching guides on YouTube too. At the start I would struggle to even hit monsters consistently; now I can solo kill an elder dragon in a few minutes. You #8217;ll get better if you keep playing it enough.</TEXT>

Just something you may not have known that might make your experience better. Since you liked IG and DB, you should try out the long sword next!

Yes, I agree with you that anyone who sexually abuses anyone, child or not, should be harshly punished. However, you said he #8217;s showing the first warning signs, and I agree, BUT, can you name a single downside to taking action right now to try and help this man change his life around? I don #8217;t know the details of rehabilitating pedophiles other than some broad knowledge I #8217;ve learned through studying psychology, but I do know that some countries have an emphasis on criminal improvement and as such have an astoundingly high criminal turnover rate. Perhaps I #8217;m wrong, and I think it #8217;s a hard decision to make. In the ideal scenario he spends time in prison then completes rehabilitation and lives the rest of his life as a good man. On the other hand he could one day commit rape and then be thrown into jail for the rest of his life. Anyway I just hope his man realizes what he #8217;s down, feels remorse, and strives to be better. Yet, some men simply don #8217;t care and feel nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, World was my first and I #8217;m in love. I recently got MH3U on Wii U and also MH4U. At first, I found it trivially easy because I was killing the monsters in less than 5 minutes. Then, in 3U, I met the Qurepeco and I couldn #8217;t kill it in the 50 minute time limit. That #8217;s never happened before. I really wanna enjoy the older games so does anyone have any general tips I should know? Similarly in 4U it was too easy then I met the Gypceros and got my ass handed to me; I still haven #8217;t killed it. It #8217;s really discouraging because I haven #8217;t even gotten to the cool monsters yet. Anyway, if you have any advice I #8217;m open to suggestions. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me at least it #8217;s because I will always see him as Davos since GoT and The Witcher are in similar settings, which means he would look roughly the same. Whereas it #8217;s not a problem with Johnny Depp for instance since there #8217;s obviously a huge difference between Captain Jack and Willy Wonka, so they don #8217;t seem like the same actor at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have probably a total of 6 cumulative hours trying to find this thing. There I was, doing a simple Radobaan hunt when I decide to check the mosswine for the hell of it. Ghillie Mantle and capture net ready, I walk on down to the piggy and lo and behold, nothing. So I just take off my mantle and unequip my net. And then... a small black ball spreads its wings and flies off the mosswine and out of sight. Yeah I wanna die. If anyone has tips I #8217;d appreciate it, but tbh I #8217;ve probably tried it.

    <TEXT>Ever since D1 throwing a knife when you meant to melee and vice versa has been annoying. Black Talon #8217;s projectile is activated by double-tapping the button, so it would be an amazing quality of life change if they added this function to all throwable melees.

    <TEXT>Hey all, I #8217;m new here, but I just wanted to write down some thoughts. Moments ago I was just chilling on YouTube watching some videos of Assassin #8217;s Creed Odyssey, then I was suddenly flooded with thoughts of Greek mythology and then this series. Whenever I tried to think about what my favorite book series was, I somehow always forgot about this one. Never, has any series, be it a book, show, etc, captivated and immersed me so much in a world. While I read these books, I truly felt like I was *there*. Many books have done that, but none have as strong as this series has. I started reading PJ in elementary school; I #8217;m now since graduated. I remember loving The House of Hades so, so very much because it was essentially a book featuring just Percy and Annabeth, and I loved their relationship. I also remember staying up all night to finish The Blood of Olympus in one sitting. All in all, I forgot about this amazing series for quite a while, and I #8217;m glad I could share my thoughts. Let me know if you guys have any similar feelings. Now, if you #8217;ll excuse me, I am definitely going to go find my copy of The Lightning Thief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes but I #8217;ve wanted to go vegan for a while now. I personally think eating them is wrong; I also wrote a persuasive speech about animal abuse in the clothing industry. However becoming vegan right now isn #8217;t one of my top priorities. Soon once I actually get to choose my own groceries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because to be completely honest I don #8217;t care enough to. For the time being, I #8217;m choosing to overlook the fact that I #8217;m consuming innocent animals. I don #8217;t choose the food I buy; if we bought vegan food then our grocery cost would dramatically increase since the rest of my family sure as hell would never go vegan. I #8217;m sorry you feel the need to go out of your way on a video game sub to harass people into going vegan. One day I #8217;ll be vegan, I promise, just not an annoying circlejerker if that #8217;s cool. Good day.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Recommendations for anime/games after DDLC?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-20 15:50:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all, I finished DDLC last night and it was my first visual novel. To summarize, it was an amazing experience. However I can #8217;t help but be left feeling empty; I was really enjoying my relationship with Natsuki and I #8217;m hoping for suggestions to help fill that void. I #8217;d prefer it to be a usual novel or anime, and for one of the characters to be a tsundere like Natsuki. Thank you for your suggestions! EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to mention I #8217;d rather it not have such a disturbing theme like DDLC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah just kill the boss; you can farm it because after you kill it then it starts you back at level 6. Also, getting just shaders is normal. The weapons are VERY rare (took me 50+ runs to get my first drop), but Bungie recently changed it so that your chance to get a weapon increases each time you don #8217;t get one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone *already* has the chance to obtain NF, they just need to work for it. If something like this bothers you, then maybe you should look into a FPS built from the ground up to be competitive, such as CSGO or Siege? Destiny is a looter shooter; people want to have items other players don #8217;t have and want unique, rare, or hard to obtain items to exist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Borderlands is an AMAZING game, don #8217;t get me wrong, but it #8217;s really nothing like Skyrim. First and foremost, it #8217;s a fast paced, co-op, looter shooter. It #8217;s not *really* open world; it basically has tons of different areas/levels that are very open, but there #8217;s really not much to explore. For instance, you can walk from one edge of Skyrim to the next seamlessly, but in Borderlands there are always loading screens between areas. Also the melee combat I find to be very, very dull. It #8217;s only viable with a gun that has a bayonet on it, and they all use the same exact attack animation. All in all, it #8217;s not an open world RPG; it #8217;s a looter shooter RPG.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I slightly think it matters, but it goes both ways and it #8217;s not just about race. For instance I didn #8217;t like how in the first Percy Jackson movie, Annabeth had brown hair when it #8217;s stated in the books her hair is blond. Also, for example, if Black Panther was played by a white guy, I #8217;m sure a lot of people wouldn #8217;t like that. When characters look on the big screen as accurately as they should, it just helps me connect with them more, but I know that #8217;s not true for everyone.</TEXT>

Hell, I already say more Ace over Luna #8217;s in comp anyway. I also really liked using the gun in PvE, but I guess those days are over. They should #8217;ve fixed hand cannons on console, then make the perk require three headshots and somehow make it not transfer to another target, for a 2-tap.

    <TEXT>Yeah, I just spent ~$1500 and I can play any game on Ultra, 1440p, and 144hz. Before I experienced it for myself, I thought performance and graphics were overrated, since I came from console. Oh how wrong I was... some games *literally* feel like I #8217;m playing a different game or a remaster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The world was brutal and all the characters in the story lost so much. Just because the show is dark and gritty doesn #8217;t mean the ending had to be. After all that had happened, I think an ending like this would #8217;ve been perfect. Yes it #8217;s predictable; yes it #8217;s generic; and yes maybe even cheesy - but I believe it #8217;s what the world and its characters deserved after everything. Man, the thought of them raising a family is far too precious. I honestly have zero desire to ever even rewatch the show and it pains me to say that. This truly is the greatest letdown in the history of storytelling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So then you are getting the content you paid for, the expansions. You will also get the season pass content, you just have to play the game - just like how you would have to play a raid to get access to its rewards. Based on my math, I #8217;ve averaged only ~6 hours a week since Shadowkeep #8217;s launch and I #8217;m level 70, and that #8217;s without going out of my way to farm for it. Personally I plan to farm out on the Moon until Tuesday to hit 100. I #8217;ve barely done most of the content so I imagine most players are investing a lot more time into the game than I am. Honestly if you put in any less time than the minuscule amount I #8217;ve put in, I #8217;m not sure why you #8217;d even care about the expansions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a disheartening fact I often think about. Traveling at the speed of light, I believe it takes ~ 100,000 years to go from one side of the Milky Way to the next, so its diameter is roughly 100,000 light years or something. Considering that fact that we won #8217;t be able to travel faster than that, it #8217;s really sad to think about the reality of space travel since there #8217;s hundreds of billions of galaxies out there. Interstellar travel can definitely happen, but I #8217;m pretty sure Star Wars levels of space travel are impossible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly!! In the last season, I barely played; when I did play, I got on and did all the available bounties for an hour or two... except by that time, I was burnt out. Doing all of that busy work just because I felt like I *had* to otherwise I would miss out on content just want fun. So after I finished bounties, I would end up hopping off the game and as such I hardly even played the actual content of the season.</TEXT>

But yeah, Whisper does fantastic damage in a lot of scenarios, except if you miss even *once*, that #8217;s a manual reload + re-proccing breathing. Totally get using something else if someone #8217;s aim isn #8217;t great for more consistent damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As of right now you #8217;ll have to pick one. Eriana #8217;s Vow is probably your best bet as it #8217;s great at taking out champions in endgame content and does good damage, plus I think it #8217;s just a super unique and fun exotic to run in everyday content.

I made the switch to PC around two years ago, and it #8217;s imo it #8217;s the greatest example of something you have no idea what you #8217;re missing until you experience it.

    <TITLE>Questions about HRT (MtF)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-16 06:32:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Realized I was trans 2 months ago and 90% of the time present male in public for background. I really want to start HRT, more than anything and I #8217;m wondering how I begin the process. I #8217;ve heard of some people going through Planned Parenthood and there is one about 5 minutes from where I live. Also, I kinda hate needles, so is there a difference between getting tablets and injections? Lastly, as I said I mostly present male because I live with family who I #8217;m not sure would understand me coming out, so if I started HRT, do you think they would notice what #8217;s up and how long until they begin to notice? Sorry if this is a lot, I #8217;m just learning so much about myself and want to do all I can right now to finally be at peace with my body. Thanks so much for reading and any help you can give!  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. When I first started going vegan, my dad asked why I wouldn #8217;t eat this one food. So I told him that I just can #8217;t support what happens to the animals and if he knew, neither would he. He then told me he knew what happened. In his mind, I think he believed that animals just deal with living in crowded farms, then they #8217;re humanely killed; not that hundreds of male baby chicks are dumped into an industrial blender each minute, or that calves are stolen from their mothers (who have been raped), then later killed. There are people out there who truly *refuse* to accept that eating animals is wrong. I got into an argument in a Discord server because people were talking about how delicious lamb is, so out of anger I sent a picture of a cute little lamb and said that #8217;s what is being slaughtered for their taste buds. They got SUPER defensive and petty, just repeating how tasty it is with the drooling emoji.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thankfully that #8217;s been done away with (as far as we know lmao), but it #8217;s still a disgusting industry. Many people probably believe eggs are a relatively harmless product, as they think no animals are directly killed, however the truth is that since mail chicks are useless to the egg industry, they #8217;re loaded onto a conveyor belt moments after birth, and dumped into a giant blender. Male cows often get clamps tightened around their testicles, until they rot and fall off as a means of castration. Females are raped and have their babies stolen, killed for veal. Pigs have a tendency so go insane and cannibalism each other. Milk also has trace amounts of blood and pus in it. I haven #8217;t even scratched the surface - just so really horrible stuff. As I mentioned in my original comment, give *Dominion* a watch if you #8217;re interested, but it #8217;s very graphic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I enjoy the sequels but they break so many things in the universe of Star Wars. Leia flying? Why didn #8217;t Jedi just superman everywhere and to get out of danger? Hyperspace ramming speaks for itself; they could just had unmanned ships ram literally everything at light speed, even if they tried to retcon it in TROS. Then force healing. It #8217;s fine in The Mandalorian because we assume Yoda #8217;s species is *especially* force sensitive AND he healed like a very small flesh wound if I remember. Meanwhile Rey heals a lightsaber wound that went straight through Ben #8217;s chest, and he brings her back from the dead, albeit at the cost of his own life. It just ruins the immersion because it introduces these very powerful abilities into the universe which makes us wonder why previous characters didn #8217;t use them. I #8217;m sure the sequels aren #8217;t the first time this has happened, not even in Star Wars, but the implications for the types of power it introduced are broken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah no Kylo #8217;s abilities are cool as hell and I meant only what I mentioned ruined it for me. My dad often likes to point out how convenient it is that every console on every planet for every purpose uses the same universal connection R2 has. It #8217;s like if we used USB for literally *everything* . Force Speed was used in a pretty minor way, however it does still break things. Obi-Wan could #8217;ve used it to zoom through the lasers in the end. My problem is that when each power I mentioned in the sequels is used, it plays a PIVOTAL role in the fate of the heroes. Leia, Rey, and Kylo directly use the force to save either themselves or someone else; Holdo uses the light speed ram to save the Resistance.</TEXT>

I mean, in the opening scene they move like 70-100 feet in around 1-3 seconds; it seems reasonable that he #8217;d be able to use it to at least get to the fight sooner.

    <TEXT>I would like to correct you by saying dairy and eggs absolutely *do* cause harm to living beings. In the egg industry, male chicks are useless so moments after birth, they #8217;re loaded onto conveyor belts at the end of which is a funnel with a giant industrial blender at the bottom. Hundreds of baby chicks per minute are blitzed into unrecognizable red paste simply because they #8217;re deemed worthless. In the dairy industry, the mothers are locked into stalls made only just big enough for them to fit in, so they cannot move an inch. They #8217;ll live most of their lives with metal contraptions fixed to their udders for milking, which often causes infections, resulting in blood and pus ending up in the milk. They #8217;re then raped multiple times per year to produce the maximum amount of milk. When they give birth, their calves are immediately stolen from them and slaughtered for veal and the mother will scream/cry for a couple of days in anguish. She #8217;ll give birth a couple times each year, which is WAY more than is healthy, and this is repeated every year until she is too frail to live, then she #8217;ll be ground up into meat. While I #8217;m sure all of us at some point have envisioned dairy and eggs coming from a nice farm where they treat the animals well and milk them by hand with a bucket, that #8217;s not true. Dairy/Egg farming today is industrialized where each living animal is seen as nothing more than an object. I know no one wants to hear this, but I wanted to make clear that dairy and eggs still result in an immense amount of suffering. If you want more information, look up Dominion over on YouTube.</TEXT>

They #8217;re either there because they #8217;re paying thousands of dollars each year to be there, or because they need to be able to pay rent and buy groceries. From my experience everyone is genuinely chill and only care about things that actually matter, like grades or getting work done. Nobody gossips in the corner about how someone #8217;s got a pink lunchbox. Of course, this is not going to ring true for everyone all the time. There will always be some shitty people no matter the environment.

    <TEXT>For sure. There are many things such as the rainbow ammo, enemy design, headshot noise, but what *really* does it for me is the atmosphere. Eternal is missing a lot of demonic themes for me. In 2016, loved how dark and evil the levels in Hell felt, and how there was a good amount of them. 2016 #8217;s levels almost had a bit of a horror atmosphere to them. They were much darker. Eternal does pretty much everything else better imo, I just wished they focused on some of the hellish/darker themes and it was less cartoonish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No I totally get that; I love that they #8217;ve fleshed out his character and all. However aesthetically, I think it was a poor choice. He looks so badass in his armor only for it to be totally ruined to see his face through the visor in cutscenes - it just looks really goofy to me and wish it was an option to use opaque visors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair that #8217;s because Gears of War #8217;s gameplay isn #8217;t centered around boss fights. Games like Destiny, Division, MMO #8217;s, etc., all have the main big boss in an encounter, and all the fodder enemies are referred to as adds. Someone might be focused on boss DPS while the others are on add management. In a game like Gears, these types of enemies are absolutely what defines the experiences, however no one is playing games in which the term  #8220;adds #8221; is typically used to only kill adds - they #8217;re there for the raid/boss mechanics and the rewards. But yeah, Remnant is a shooter in which we essentially have infinite ammo and can kill things extremely easily, even on Apocalypse. Having only started Apoc recently, I immediately had to adapt to a more evasive playstyle since ranged enemies 2-3 shot me. Personally I think it #8217;s balanced and fun, having to be mindful of my flanks, when to shoot, and when to dodge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely not. Sometimes my 144hz monitor will revert down to 60hz, and as soon as I boot up a game I *instantly* notice it. 60 FPS is great, but 144 is just a game changer. It #8217;s like, yeah, my mattress is fine - then you invest into an actual quality mattress, and you all of the sudden had no idea laying down could feel so good. I drive an old car from 2002 and a while back I had to drive my friend #8217;s car made in the last couple of years and it was absolutely mind-blowing how much better every single thing felt. Going from 30-60 feels insane; going from 60-144 feels freaking incredible. It #8217;s gotten to the point where things don #8217;t feel right if they #8217;re not at least ~90. However for the most part 60 is pretty fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. Said this in another comment but sometimes my monitor will revert back to 60hz, and I #8217;ll know when it does because as *soon* as I load up a game, despite the FPS counter saying 144hz, it doesn #8217;t feel like it. Then I #8217;ll check display settings and lo and behold it #8217;s set to 60hz. The difference is incredible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Assuming you #8217;re right There is no right or wrong here. Unless you #8217;re asking me to explain the science of *why*, in which case I have no clue nor do I think it #8217;s relavent. It seems like you haven #8217;t tried out displays above 60 before, so I urge you to go try it out. Since you seem predetermined to refute a difference above 60, you might not notice a big change, or maybe you will. I, along with tons and tons of other people definitely see a huge difference when it comes to 60-144. 60 is already pretty smooth, or rather it was; 144 just cranks that smoothness up to 11 and there is no way I #8217;d ever go back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They seemed to really force feed the idea of Starks being unquestionable good guys in the later seasons. Arya murders an entire family, *bakes a son into a pie*, then feeds it to the father. While yes, the Freys betrayed the Starks... Robb literally broke the vow he made and took advantage of Walder Frey. But everyone always cheers for every single psychotic thing Arya does in the later seasons because  #8220;Starks good #8221;. Personally haven #8217;t read the books yet, but I #8217;ve heard Tyrion is supposed to be much more morally neutral than he #8217;s portrayed in the later seasons as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope not just you. Finn should have either A) been the Jedi of the story like he was teased to be or, B) sacrificed himself to save the Resistance like he was going to before Rose stopped him. At least that way his character wouldn't have been butchered and his existence in the story would have mattered. The kiss is just bad since they had zero chemistry, barely knew each other, and if it wasn't for Luke, the entire Resistance would've died because Rose was horny.</TEXT>

Not sure why, but I recently just had a spark (hehe) of Transformers interest recently, and my little brother and I have been watching all the movies. We #8217;ve never seen TLK or Bumblebee so I was excited! Regardless, I realized I #8217;ll always enjoy Transformers movies and found TLK fun to watch. Bumblebee is on our schedule tonight! Honestly, with work and college, I got a looming feeling that my childhood days were truly over, but after buying a bunch of these figures, and watching the movies and shows, I #8217;m happy to say.... they #8217;re not :)</TEXT>
