    <TITLE>What certs to future proof my career path?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-13 03:16:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR - #160;I have been in desktop support for a very long time and need to #160;know what certs to go with to move my career forward, and stay relevant in the marketplace of the future. OK folks, here goes my first Reddit post, ever:  #160;I am looking for some much-needed input. I have been in desktop/client support for close to a decade now. Naturally, over the years I have gained some seniority; however, #160;I am still working as a "senior desktop support specialist" (more like Level 2 support) with some light sysadmin responsibilities (AD, GP, server admin, some virtualization management, and light SCCM management for OS and software deployment). #160;I also have some certifications under my belt (ITIL, A+, net+, sec+). I am not proficient at scripting, although I do massage some PowerShell scripts here and there. It #160;is time for that long overdue career change into managing/working with other technologies, and I feel the need to go with a cert that helps my career move forward. I've read a lot about VCP6.5-DCV for datacenter virtualization, Amazon's #160;Certified Solutions Architect Associate and Microsoft Azure certs for Cloud management, and to transition into a more managerial role; PMP and Agile are good to have. However, back in my early days of IT, MCSA: Server, Citrix Xen and CCCNA were the hot topics of the moment. Is there still value in them?

    <TEXT>Hey ya #8217;ll! Is it me, or Destiny two was nerfed up after it became a  #8220;Free to play #8221;? I bought it on Console when it came out and now I am playing it on PC with a brand new character and there appears to be way less baddies, A lot more dumber ones, and way easier to kill off than when I played it the first time around on Console. My character also appears ro be too over powered. Am I the only one experiencing this dissonance? I #8217;m playing the Red Legion storyline, by the way. Does it get better afterwards?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I asked this in another sub without much in the way of success, so I thought to ask this here and see how it goes. Here is why I ask: We normies, who are not well versed in the ways of Economists, keep seeing record breaking stats in terms of Stock Markers, Low Unemployment, GDP(?), Increased Productivity, etc. Yet, every now and again, we see stats that says we (Millennials, in my case) are essentially poorer than previous generations, with increasing income inequality, we are earning less, are more in debt, dying younger, less healthy, way more stressed out than our forefathers, and to top it off, sadder(more depressed?)! I believe we tend to view these stats in terms of our "past performance" in an ethnocentric way. However, it would be nice to see how we are faring against the rest of the globe without the Top 5% of earners. Why take the top 5% out? Because, in my opinion, with the Bezos/Gates/Buffets/Waltons of the Nation in the equation, our income and wealth, will most surely look as if our nation is living its best life. Are we, though?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Am I being swindled?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-03 05:36:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok Reddit I need your input on this. I live in good ol #8217; Murica, I have been consulting for some time. And have reach a point where my largest customer, offered me to hire me outright OR, asked for a contract to have them as my priority, somehow. Since I am new to entrepreneur, I don #8217;t even have my LLC yet. I #8217;m just consulting on the side and it has been leaving me with some awesome money at the end of the months. Let #8217;s just say they want me to build an their entire  #8220;marketing #8221; department, for now. this seems like an exciting since I have managed said department, and have but I have never been involved in staffing, and leading operations, but never been the head honcho of anything, other than my nascent john doe marketing consultancy. It #8217;s really not marketing, but it #8217;s along those lines. Just trying not give too much away for reasons that will be obvious in a bit. Well, there is this company that offer small businesses to create pretty much their entire online structure(websites, all social media presence, etc), they also give you strategic management advice( profit/loss, sales, how to properly hire people, contract negotiation on your behalf, proposals, business model canvas, and even an exit strategy if I were to want to sale, etc.) and they charge 30k a year for doing this  #8220;counseling #8221;. They even do it here, on reddit. Hence I feel I #8217;ve given more than I should. I #8217;m serious leaning towards the entrepreneurial side here and find a way to give a good contract for my client, even thoughI have never done one in such capacity. The thing is, My  #8220;client #8221; asked me for an answer or a proposal this coming week and the consulting people have been selling themselves hard to me, even stating that they will help me gain more customers while they work for me. However I don #8217;t want to sign this consulting company without having an agreement with my largest, and I don #8217;t fucking know how to even propose something that is to my advantage and while making my customer happy. I know I can do the job, I just need guidance, but 30k worth of guidance a year when I only have 10k operating budget, seems like a huge mistake to me. I asked them to just pet me Pay them to show me how to properly make a proposal, and there if the customer agreed on it, I Wild signed up with them. They stated that this was not economically feasible for them, it was either 30k a year, or nothing. What would you find people of reddit recommend I do? What resources are out there to learn how to make proposals, contract negotiation, marketing strategies, sale strategies, and exit strategies, etc, etc, etc? Am I even making sense here? Am I being swindle by the consultancy company? How would you move forward? Edit: I stand to make hundreds of thousands of dollars if I play my cards right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is my third time going playing this delightful game, and in my previous two go arounds, I just went for the main story and some relevant side quests. This time around I #8217;m doing the main story plus all available side quests and monster hunts before moving to the next  #8220;level #8221; in the storyline. I have put in over 120 hours and just now I #8217;m past midpoint of the game! AND i #8217;m only doing some of the side content(mostly those that include places of power). So, with that in mind: How many hours did it take you to finish the main story and all side quests? How many hours including DLCs? How many freaking side quests does this game actually have? Did you have as much fun (investing, if you will) your time in a game such as the Witcher3? If so, which was it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK folks I need your help! I live in good ol #8217;Murica, I have been in Technical support as an employee for many years and through unforeseen events(I quit a job because It got me really sick), I found myself providing tech services(server admin/troubleshooting, wired and wireless network support, pc and peripherals support, customer service, technical advise, etc) to a slew of companies registered as individual LLCs, but owned by the same guy. I first started working with one of the facilities as a favor to a friend of a friend and decided to charge enough to cover gas and a byte to eat(say $80/hour). Well, they kept calling me for more services, and Knowing I hadn #8217;t done my research(nor I know how to), I decided to raise the price 40% for another facility that was twice as far than the one I have been helping, and they happily agreed upon the terms( think $130/h). This obviously set off alarms as to how low I am vs all other service providers. Well, now the managers from the 15 remaining facilities want me to be their sole it provider. Each unit houses between 10 and 20 people. The owner even voiced interest in hiring me to helm its nascent IT department. Something which sound interesting, but I #8217;m liking the control that comes from owning my own company. The thing is, I do not know how to properly charge them. I know glassdoor is there for you to find out potential salary for negotiation purposes when you are looking to be hired by a company, but I don #8217;t know if there is such tools for new entrepreneurs. I want to charge them fairly, but I can #8217;t help but think that I am getting the short end of my own stick, here. There is also the issue of covering liability and all things I am learning an IT entrepreneur needs to be looking at. Lastly, there is the issue of contract. I #8217;ve never done one for any of my clients as this has always been a side hustle rather than my main job. But, let #8217;s keep it with the pricing part first.

He made his last Album on his new residence in the middle of nowhere. He even said he wasn #8217;t please at first, but that this place would protect him and his love ones. Check it out: https://youtu.be/QuOCvKvrwI8 I believe this new Virus is not a coincidence. That this shit is planned. Maybe I #8217;m totally wrong, but that #8217;s my conspiracy for you.

    <DATE>2020-06-24 06:05:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Guardians, I procured the Season of Arrivals when it came out. This is my second attempt to pass the Means and End mission and as before I see it is asking me to wait multiple hundred seconds to end it. As I said, this is my second run. When I passed this mission the first time, it did the same thing, but I thought to myself  #8220;waiting a few minutes isn #8217;t that bad #8221;. However I got tired and went into orbit. Big mistake. I went into orbit thinking I was going to be able to do the follow any more season related missions, just to find out that the mission required  #8220;means to and end #8221; AGAIN. It took three days or so for the MtAE mission to open again for me to complete. Is this a glitch in the system. Is  #8220;interference #8221; (the campaign after  #8220;Means to an end #8221;the only campaign related to this season? What am I missing here? Please help. Note: I hope this makes sense. Ask away if you need clarification.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Always ONLINE gaming is stupid as fuck!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 19:45:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>If I go and pay 60 bucks for a game, or 70, or up to 120 for a game, I shouldn #8217;t have to be  #8220;always online #8221; to play the fucking game. I already paid my money for me to play a game, and that #8217;s all I want to do. Paying is not me giving you permission to track my every fucking move online and milk it to the moon. All of those contracts allowing companies to do this should be made illegal. For me, this is specially glaring with games that do not have a major multiplayer component. If I wanna play campaign just for the experience why the fuck do I have to be online. Where is the fucking offline mode? If there is a need for an update, do a fucking press release for people to willingly go and get the update. Jumping on to play your favorite game #8217;s campaign and finding that you can #8217;t do it because there are bugs that need fixing in the  #8220;multiplayer mode #8221; is annoying as fuck, and a waste of time. I always remember how XBOX One had this always online feature and it almost destroyed the console #8217;s market share. Why is this? Because it is fucking stupid. Unless I want to play online with friends and shit, most people just want to play their games and chill, not find out what billy is doing over in that other game I haven #8217;t purchase just yet. Those online notifications are also annoying as fuck! Lastly, the same goes with DLCs and micro transaction. I already bought the game, as is, so why are you going to constantly be pushing me to buy fucking additional content when I only want to enjoy the game experience it came with? When they do this mid game, these notifications destroy the immersion. It makes us feel that companies is all about their money and not the gamers. Even if it #8217;s about the bottom line, help the fucking customers get what they pay for. Once you are married and have children, you can #8217;t have all the time in the world to wait for a fucking update. Just make it optional, and say, and I #8217;m paraphrasing  #8220;hey, if you wanna get rid of X, Y, and Z glitches, then download this update, if not fuck you! #8221; In my opinion, grown ass gamers would respect developers and publishers even more, if they were to do something like this. End of this disjointed rant.</TEXT>

We then see the Chief going to it to get Cortana and the Index, and the rest is gaming history. After it was all said and done, though, we never get to see how Earth was disinfected from The Flood? We know a single spore could destroy an entire planet. How did they manage to avoid total destruction on Earth from a potential flood infestation? Also, Is there an official source detailing these events? Edit: Thanks for the replies.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-15 02:33:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title implies, TLOK is truly not a bad show. As a person who saw ATLA for the first time as an adult, I can see why people who grew up watching Avatar, may think the show is subpar. Many of my friends also think so! But the truth is that the show is a spin-off, and it has a different vibe. If you come at it not knowing much about the previous show you are likely to enjoy it for what it is. IMHO, ATLA was a show about kids in the very uncomfortable situation of being kids in a world at war. Not only that, it is up to them to End the war. So far, my understanding of Korra is it is a story of a person trying to find her own destiny and dealing with uncomfortable situations along the way. I #8217;m not quite done yet. I will continue watching and see where this journey takes me. Anyways that #8217;s my two sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing to do with racism. It has to donwith a Eurocentric view of the world. Every king that presided over the enslavement of people, ehtnic clensing and the stealing of lans across the world is a considered tyrant. The only difference is the romanization that the West has over our history. People were still being raped, maimed, masacred, kidnapped and brutalized even when England, France, and Spain Were living through their richest periods in European history. They were doing so, because these tyrants were enriching themselves through the stealing of African and native American property. If African was only dealing with its own  #8220;kings #8221; the wealth would have stay with them. Not saying they were good kings or tyrants. No king or tyrant is, but let #8217;s not romanticize the horrors Europeans did across the globe for the sake of profiting themselves at the expense of literally everyone else.</TEXT>

Other than that, play some of the  #8220;New light #8221; stuff then go and play the legacy content first. Red war, then curse of Osiris, and so on. The lore will make a lot more sense if you play it that way. Other than that, you won #8217;t get good at multiplayer right away. Some of these guardians will beat che living sh*t out of you, but it will be fun gaming. I would check out Gambit as you are learning the ropes on multiplayer. You will see other gamers do their thing and learn how they play. Try and get some friends and make up a fireteam. I have personally never done a Raid, but I heard they are hella fun and hella long(6 hours to complete is not unheard of). Season passes are nice to have but not necessary at all to enjoy the game. Though the game will make you feel as such. I have bought two and they only offer two or three new quest lines, a weekly quest line, armor, and a some thing to do here and there. Not that much, but again, it #8217;s a  #8220;nice to have #8221;, not a necessity.</TEXT>

I will commit heresy by saying this, but the second to last movie, was my favorite , precisely because it tried ti depart from what the rest were doing by saying  #8220;you don #8217;t have to be special to be a force wielder #8221;.

What surprises me about it though, is that there hasn #8217;t been a Truth and Reconciliation moment in all European countries involved in the systemic kidnapping, enslaving, maiming, rape, and pillaging that took place for such a long time. Most of out  #8220;first world #8221; economic reality is based on this shared history, yet we are just now coming to grip with the monstrosity of it all. It #8217;s not like world war 2, where we decry its barbarity right after the war ended, or apartheid in South Africa. The germans used African Colonies as a way to practice what they implemented first in spain, then in the war, but we don #8217;t hear much about it. Americans have their own story. The Spaniards and French don #8217;t even talk about theirs shared culpability as much as Americans do, and they were even more brutal than the English.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See? You are seeing it from an Eurocentric frame of mind. Wealth came from slavely only in some coastal towns. Not in places like the congo. Remember, before European Colonization of America, Europe was Broke as shit due to Turkish blockade of the mediterranean and all the wars among European kingdoms and the crusades(more like the wars in spain). This is what prompted Europeans to find new trade routes. People also forget that Portuguese people European, the first to directly trade with Tropical Africans, didn #8217;t trade in slave right away, they were trading in goods, AND they were doing good economically. This is also what motivated the Spaniards to try and go west towards their trading partners in the indies. Because Portugal was claiming a degree of exclusivity of the African trade route. Lastly, Before the conquest of the Americas #8217; there were free black people in spain. There were also slaves of all races, most black slaves didn #8217;t work the land, but they were used as translators to trade goods with Africans. My point? Things would not have been worst for the Africans should Europe see Africa as a trading partner rather than a source for slave labor. The problem is that once the Americas were  #8220;discovered #8221; the rush to exploit it was almost unbearable for the kings and queens of the time. After all their kingdoms depended on them being wealthy, and they were broke. So they started dehumanizing people for the sake of their profit starting with the natives. And as they say, the rest is a horrible history.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is true. Plantations in latin America and the caribbean were literal death camps. The irony of it all is that there were black people in Columbus #8217; ship. Very few were freemen, others were house slaves and consort women. There were white and black consort women on the ships. The story shift when the colonizers try and convince the church of the dehumanization of the natives and subsequent slaves for the purpose of profiting from them. Then the writing changed. There are letters in caribbean museums that alude to this fact. I traveled through latin America with my family as a child. I went to a few of these museums. The reality is that, at least here in America we are just coming to grips with the reality that our knowledge of history is clouded by supremacist views. I #8217;m sure it is so in Europe, but it #8217;s taken this long for people to want to actually know the truth about the American conquest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This analogy makes a shit ton of sense. I mean, I still remember a few years ago the fox news/ Glen Beck rallies around 2010 where they would chant  #8220;We are going to take our country back! #8221; After all the only real goal of the Republican Party was to make Obama a one term President. And they were shattered when the black man won over their by the book, red blooded, true American ( white), candidate Mitt Romney. And in comes Trump taking advantage of this craving for  #8220;winning #8221; and promises them they will  #8220;MAGA #8221; which is essentially a repackaging of taking their country back, and that they will be tired of winning. And they sucked it all up. When I asked my friends(more like former friends)!what they like about Trump, they say  #8220;The Economy #8221;, and when I tell them the economy is a remnant of the Obama years and that there was record level employment during these years, and they look at me with such disbelief. One even asked me  #8220;how come I never knew about it, then? #8221; Well, because you only watch fox news and random pages on facebook, that #8217;d why! I will finish with this, I remember when obama was in office how Fox news would yell to the four winds that the record unemployment numbers were being cooked. That the real number was like 19 percent, that people were giving up job searches en mass and that they were counting the numbers wrong. Then like a month after Trump won, everybody at fox was marveled at the low unemployment cause by just electing Trump. That the market reached a record high because the market felt  #8220;reassured #8221;, and that America was already starting to see a comeback because of Trump even before the president was sworn in. It was quite impressive, and more impressive it is that we forgot all about them peddling this bullshit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A third of republicans are ill informed, a third of republicans are straight up racist, and a third of republicans are straight up in it for economic gain. They could care less what happens to the nation as long as they remain on top of the rubble. Afterall, when you are on a mega Yatch snorting coke and partying it out with hookers, you don #8217;t really get to see the riots from afar. When you are on a Safari, who the fuck cares if a poor black man was shot? when you are hitting the slopes, who cares if someone lost their house?  #8220;That #8217;s their problem, not mine. #8221; So while I agree with some of what you say, i have to say that the ill informed third, which is usually the christian right, is being manipulated into believing that the left is a bunch of murdering babies socialist monsters and that THEY have the moral high ground. Their pastors tells them so, their  #8220;trusted and balanced #8221; news sources tell them so, their favorite politicians, and sport figures tells them so. I remember back when Trump was running, I went to a small little town for a camping trip, and I started this conversation with a Church going lady on a Sunday, and we got to talking about Clinton and Trump for some reason, and she straight up told me that it was her church assigned task to read up on all news sources educate herself on  #8220;the issues #8221; and go back and tell her church who to vote for. One person would tell a group of somewhere between 30-150+ people in a small town who to vote for. And since she was a church-going, clearly-never-lying Christian, then she would believe her. No need to critically think shit. And that #8217;s how these people could live with themselves. These people mean well, they are moral people, but the system in which they grew up on is geared towards keeping them blind and scared all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends how the Dems behave in the next four years. There is likely going to be a progressive candidate. the next four years will be really tough for the Dems, because of what I call  #8220;The unfuckening! #8221;, Which is reverting all of the mess the Trump Administration got us in. This will generate a lot of criticism from the progressives AND from the very loud voices on the right. Now, it is likely that the party will rally behind her IF they see some popular progressive ideas implemented, like a public option, some form of free college, and a comprehensive infrastructure bill that would put a shit ton of people back to work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh fuck you! I my wife went to school at his University and knows the guy personally, and I can tell you she says he isn #8217;t means spirited. He is not a racist. But he does like to say off color jokes from time to time. Right now there are people literally being bullied for being of Asian descent, and he with all of his years in education should have known that wasn #8217;t gonna fly. Especially, since the guy was being recorded. Few people talk about this, but when you are in a position of power, even at a University, you will always find people trying to take you down a peg so they can put themselves in your position. The problem is that this guy has been in said position for such a long time( my wife graduated a long time ago) that he probably got used to getting his way. Anyone criticizing him for being so callous is not racist, they are just rightly pissed at the guy. Besides, he isn #8217;t likely going to be  #8220;fired #8221;, because he likely has clout at the institution. They may give him a pass after a few semesters. Wife told me he is a really good teacher. So OP, shut the hell up with your bullshit agenda!</TEXT>

His family and friends are being pumped with fear while they are seating confortably in front of their TVs or phones Most of the Fascists coming to destroy shit and to rile peaceful protesters up aren #8217;t even from they towns they are protesting in. Their only purpose is to make the protests look bad by any means. What protesters need to start doing is taking the protests to conservative wealthier towns. I would be protesting in front of the house of the armed shooting heavily. Make them feel the pain people suffer in poor/black/brown communities. Most of the cops patrolling and harassing people of color live in communities similar to that of the shooter. That #8217;s why they could care less. Their towns are safe, and they get to play war games on other people #8217;s towns. That #8217;s all bullshit. Edit: Protests, not riots. If people protest peacefully in suburbs, the rioting will suddenly stop. Because I believe the rioting is happening because of people are protesting in poor communities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you ever asked him? I had an ex girlfriend suck me once with cheese in her mouth. Long story short, we were in a motel, we have had sex already, but we were two young, stupid and horney mofos. So We were playing with the food and one thing let to another and I just flashed my dicked in front of her face while she was eating cheese and and she went for it. We had a blast! She was laughing while with her mouth was pack with meat and cheese. So you never know what your partners are into until you ask or try.</TEXT>

Honestly, it was a spur of the moment thing, we were young. It wasn #8217;t even that pleasurable. It was hard to stick it in, and her knees got rough up a bit. We were young, horny, and stupid. We still laugh about it though we are married to different people.</TEXT>

He is all about sharing the goods and miracles, socialist. Being that he would be is ultra religious in his behavior, conservative. Given that he is likely to be nice to women, but at the same time profess the 2000 year old view that women believe in the homes and must be submissive to their husbands, misogynistic. And given that he grew up in a religious that professes that only a selected group of people are the chosen people of god, and even though all welcome in but only one group is special in the eye of god, he will be accused of being discriminatory or even racist. Jesus would be an extreme version of the An American Pickle movie. He is likely to just remain in his own lane and not participate in politics all together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. Here it goes. I have visited Kenosha in another lifetime. And I will tell you about it first. Kenosha is a relatively poor town south of the Main city Milwaukee. Kenosha used to be mostly about farming and the industries related to it, but with the advent of big warehouses like the Amazon ones Kenosha, and Racine, next to it started bring in more jobs. Kenosha is Trump country with a liberal enclave where most Minorities live. But outside of that enclave, it #8217;s ruby red. Most cops live in the Ruby red areas. So when rhey are sent on Patrol to the poorer areas of town, it feels like it truly is an invasion. As with every other town in America. Race plays a factor. Wisconsin is one of the worst states for black people to live in and advance. Now to the shooting that killed two people and injured one guy. Most of the people that live in and around Kenosha, tend to be very conservative people. Nothing really happens around kenosha for what I remember. My buddy was born south of there, and he #8217;s told he how boring it was to live around the Area. BUT, over the last few years, as with every other small town in America, people are glued to Faux News and their fears have been stocked to the max. So, it #8217;s become a fad, to  #8220;back the blue! #8221; As a way to say, we don #8217;t really like black people, and that #8217;s Everywhere. Enter the killer kid. That kid shouldn #8217;t have been there. Where were his parents? Why dis they allow him to have a gun. Who owns the gun? Apply every stereotypical question about lack of parenthood to this kids parent and you will find the answer there. No parental involvement, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, out of wedlock births, essentially this kid is product of the reality poor white America lives, but is so eager to paint every other group of people with. That kid even belongs to a gang. Did you not see him making street signs to the police/the people at back him?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. Look, college is a institution to expand your knowledge and horizons. I used to think exactly like you. However, I took a few required history classes, a personal finance class, a psychology, a public speaking and a class that helped me gain critical thinking(english communications and civics). These classes helped me put things in context. For instance, I love video-games and I wanted to make them myself. After taking a psychology class, I learned about Pavlov, and Skinner, and when loot boxes became popular, I knew right away what they were designed for and why I should be against them. The psychology of addiction helped me understand a shit ton of my behavior towards certain things, like reddit. Then there is the issue of race in my country of origins, America. While I grew up mostly abroad, I always thought the race issue was overblown. Until, I took two American history classes and I saw how people that didn #8217;t look like me have been treated to this day. Lastly, I took civics, English communications and public speaking classes. In the English class I learned about all the logical fallacies and how Public Speakers use them to their advantage, how public speaking works, how the government works, what propaganda was, what spinning was, how the rich use Talking Heads to influence our behavior. And even though I am in the field of technology, I can see through the bullshit of sellers, politicians, telemarketers, managers, and even customers. All while Understanding my hidden biases, and the ethical and legal framework for doing things. Not only that, because of the personal finance class, I was able to learn how to minimize my student loan burden, and though it took me for ever, I am almost done paying my student loans and I #8217;m a millennial. I don #8217;t even own credit cards anymore. So it wasn #8217;t all a waste. I am a better person because of it. It did take me longer to graduate, but I #8217;m happy I took those classes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Defunded, not abolished. Over the last few decades police in America has been buying military grade equipment. This equipment has been coming from the wars in Irak and Afghanistan. Welp! It looks like whomever made the budget, forgot to add some de-escalation training in there, coupled with some history and cultural diversity classes into it. Something to help cops understand that it is not about confrontation, but also being part of the community in which they serve. Now why defund? It is a brinksmanship tactic for people that feel pressure to defund it to instead come back with reforms. If one demanda reform, it usually doesn #8217;t happen. But if you demand taking the money out, someone at the negotiating table will say  #8220;but wait, how about we make some meaningful reforms? #8221; This is what people are looking for, primarily. Less aggressive tactics and less death at the hands of law enforcement. There is also tge need to establish some sort of mental health branch of police. Why? Because police Is the first to arrive when someone is having some mental breakdown of one kind or another. If police agrees to this, they will continue to receive money. No defunding needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh! Fosho! I mean, there was a time in which all the people able to vote were OK with slavery. I mean, what the fuck! There was a time in which a whole country went to war over their concept of being a master race? Like who #8217;s stupid enough to even think that? There was a country that literally has ben  #8220;OK #8221; with letting police murder people and go unchecked. So you are summarily right. The problem with an uber divided society is that any of those injustices could still be considered  #8220;legal #8221;, and inmoral. However because there isn #8217;t consensus of any kind, the injustices continue to happen. Take the example of a time in which some people were literally being forced to sit on the back of a bus and drink from different water fountains, and go to underperforming schools. All of that was illegal, but because there wasn #8217;t a consensus. It took Civil unrest to make that wrong somewhat right. The goal is not to have a homogeneous country. It is good to have different ideas. The goal is that the majority is informed enough to make moral and ethical decisions that are  #8220;on the right side of history #8221; and provide the best  #8220;good #8221; for most people in said society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing. I heard on NPR a few weeks back that American Christian conservatives share their own brand of Christianity. A christianity where Jesus would be OK with their leaders and males in general getting their hands  #8220;dirty #8221; to protect their property, their community, and the  #8220;purity #8221; of their women and children. This is why they worship John Wayne, and Ronald Reagan, and Donald Trump. They see these guys as the imperfect vessels that are somehow(and this is the fucked up part) sent by their god to do what must be done for the good of their communities (which are primarily white, then Christian). Now In my opinion, this is the same brand of christianity that justified income inequality, racial segregation, the massacres of native Americans, and manifest destiny. So when they see a white kid already having criminal records, walking illegally with a gun, and killing people they don #8217;t like, they see it as god #8217;s sign that they defending their right to property and liberty. And that #8217;s OK by then. This is why, people on Faux News are defending the indefensible in this kids who murder 2 and injured another, and why White evangelicals are voting Trump no matter what. I #8217;ve seen white Evangelical Jesus being called Supply Side Jesus on some corners of the web. Look it up.</TEXT>

Treating him like an instantaneous threat in a world that automatically see him as a threat triggered him as much as it triggered her. The more you marginalize people the more you radicalize them.

    <TITLE>Bungie, Is it too much to ask for offline solo campaign missions? This  #8220;contacting server #8221; bullsh*t is exhausting!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 21:16:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Exactly what the title said. I understand the stores, co-op missions, I understand multiplayer missions need to be online, these make sense. But not all missions are played with other players. Requiring Solo campaigns to be always online does not make sense at all. It is just tiring to have to reconnect all the time, especially in rural areas where connectivity may not be as reliable. I buy everything that makes sense to further the lore, seasons, extensions, etc. but It becomes a pain in the rear to have to worry about my crappy connection every time I want to chill and go kill some AI controlled grunts. I cannot be the only one that feels this way. Oh and not only that. If I need to go take a leak, a pause button would be nice. Once again, I get that multiplayer and co-op need to be online, but why do I have to worry if my guardian is going to be logged out if I #8217;m not even fighting in the Crucible, or Being a baddie on Gambit? Can anybody explain the logic to me? Offline and pause for campaign solo mode is a winner, Bungie, and you know it. Why not make some of us guardians happy and implement it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Children, you are not ready for this TED talk, but here it goes anyways: It depends on who you were. If you were religious, like the quakers in North America and the catholic friars in South and Central America, you were not OK with slavery. If you were a poor white person, or a greedy motherfucker like Hernan Cortez in Mexico, and  #8220;baron de la Warr #8221; in the US, or you were far removed from it like the Royals were, then you were OK with it. But the truth is that a shit ton of people were against with slavery since the American continent was  #8220;discovered #8221;. Hell! Even in latin America where the spaniards enslaved more people and were even more brutal than the English, there are example of writings of clergy such as friar Bartolome de las Casas, were he opposed first the enslavement of natives, and then the enslavement of Africans. There were many people opposed to slavery as early as 1512. I venture most people saw enslaving people as a evil that they couldn #8217;t change. After all, the slave trade to the American continent started during the times of absolute monarchies, and in the case of the catholic kingdoms the times of the inquisition. This means that almost everyone in the Europe of the time was essentially enslaved to the monarchies. So is you would say shit against what the monarchy or the church were doing, you would likely be killed as a heretic. Unless, you were protected by the church, which is the reason why religious clergy is showcases prominently as the main voice against enslavement of human beings. The antislavery movement of the early 1500s was so successful that the catholic clergy convinced the Spanish Monarchy of not enslaving Native Americans of the time. They tried to do it for African slaves also, so the children of Africans and Spaniards were indeed free men, UNLESS, they committed  #8220;crimes #8221;. Then they could be re-enslaved. So as you can imagine, those greedy motherfuckers invented any and every which way to reenslave by any cause or means, and they were successful for the most part. There were, however exceptions in which Black and Native people fought their way back to freedom and formed towns of their own that were never reenslaved. There is one such in Colombia, and there is the Gar #237;funa towns in central America. We don #8217;t talk about this oppisitions, because history is usually written by the winners and their supporters. And since slavery was providing the European crowns more money than what they knew to do with, it is obvious that they would not write much about people not being OK with seeing other people being kidnapped, mutilated, raped, maimed, beaten, otherwise dehumanized. i will end up my rant with this: So your assertion is wrong. There were many people against slavery since a greedy sociopath came up with the idea. But at the time of its inception, everyone was essentially enslaved to the Crowns or the church, and if you were to speak up, you #8217;d end up at the pyres for Heresy. Money will make people justify the crazies shits down to killing their own brothers and sisters in humanity. But fighting for the bit of humanity they had inside them, that, a shit ton of people did. Also, fuck the romanization of slavery, racism, and white supremacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t believe I #8217;m defending Trump, but in all fairness, the next guy happens to be the last guy #8217;s Number 2. So for him, and many of his supporters, electing him is going back to what they see as  #8220;dark times #8221; in history. Remember when Chuck Norris made that video stating that if Obama got re-elected in 2012 #8220;a thousand years of darkness #8221; would befall the Earth? Well, they are doing everything they can to make it a reality. So when they tell you how horrible America will be if Biden wins, it #8217;s because they will do their worst to make it a reality for us all. So we gotta vote them all out in November 3, and then again in 2022, until there isn #8217;t any more Trumpism left in politics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You would be right if you add this  #8220;If you are WHITE, and born in US. #8221; There are areas in the US that are as poor as third world countries, if you can believe that. They struggle with access to reliable food sources, and there is a shit ton of people homeless, millions, in fact. America was designed to be the land of opportunity for WHITES only. This is why groups have been fighting to get up to the same level, but obviously the system can #8217;t have that. In America a poor uneducated white man, has more chances to get ahead than a college educated black man. Look it up, no lie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is true. It #8217;s actually hard to watch so many mindless drones parroting the same prepackaged bullshit they saw on Fox News, or any other conservative site. Same goes for liberal politics. Now comparing r/politics as the counter to r/conservative is wrong for a simple reason. There is r/liberals and r/askliberals for you to use. The reason why r/politics feels liberal, is because the majority of reddit is indeed liberal white people, mostly American. Not because the sub is inherently liberal, or conservative. Remember kiddos, in America, the majority of the People do lean to the left, as seen in the popular vote of Clinton, and the two success elections of Obama. The problem is that there is an Extremely vocal right.</TEXT>

None of these groups are libertarian. What concerns me the most is that people buy into these new terms as if they somehow mean anything different than what they actually are. Saying alt-right isn #8217;t fascist is like saying  #8220;the first-order isn #8217;t a re-branding of the empire #8221; in stars wars mythology.

    <TEXT>Lol! Here we go again with the rebranding. A shit ton of People back in the Nazis times weren #8217;t outright Nazis, yet they were nazis sympathizers. People who support far right ideology on the internet are just a few step away from marching themselves. In fact, they are enabling the marchers. These are therefore far right people themselves. Here is the thing with groups like antifa. Antifa isn #8217;t a cohesive group like the far right groups such as the Proud Boys, and the kkk. Anybody with black shirt and a mask can claim to be Antifa. In fact, there have plenty of reports of white nationalists putting in  #8220;Antifa #8221; clothing and the. Adding a red band to their arms so they can identify each other in the chaos they themselves saw. These are organized and fully funded groups. Again, it #8217;s all rebranding. Far right is far right, usually characterized by the same racists ideologies of the last 150 years. They may call themselves rosebud boys, but they are the same as the Nazis. The thing is, younger generations of fascists just don #8217;t want to associated with losers, like the Nazis and confederates, but they share the same ideology. Just rebranded to look appealing. It #8217;s same old same old. Again, none of the these groups are libertarian.</TEXT>

There were blacks fighting in the side of the confederacy, there were Americans fighting on the side of the English crown. There will always be outliers in all race creeds, and cultures, but that doesn #8217;t negate the fact that the proud boys are more aligned in ideology with the KKK and Fascists than any other group. Same goes for the Alt-right. Al-qaeda and ISIS were two distinct groups, yet their ideology mirrored one another. There are plenty of examples of this type of rebranding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>About antifa. I #8217;m not defending it nor condoning the behaviors of those who  #8220;claim #8221; to be antifa. About the  #8220;handbook: who wrote the handbook and who #8217;s the audience? Be real anybody can write a handbook against white people say, this was done by black people, viceversa. Antifa, is a set of antifascist ideology. I too wish they were centralized, that way I know who should go to jail, but they are not. This decentralization makes them an easy target. As I said in my previous posting, anybody with a black shirt, a makeshifts mask, and out in the street can claim to be Antifa. It #8217;s easy to claim it, fascists have indeed done it, and the FBI has reported it. The antifa label for Anarchist is just an easy way to delegitimize true antifacist movements. It #8217;s like fox news using the  #8220;Mainstream media #8221; as a punching when they are indeed the most viewed  #8220;news #8221; cable channel in the country. It #8217;s easy to fight against something that can #8217;t fight back. What bothers me the most though, is that people are so lacking in education that they easily fall for this traps. I #8217;m not even a political scientist, but I know propaganda, scapegoating, red herrings, racism, fascism, capitalism, socialism , and even libertarianism. If one know what these mean and how they operate, one can clearly see when one is being bullshitted into believing something erroneous. Once again none of these group advocate for small government ideologies associated with libertarianism. As they say in the memes: Change my mind!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What an awesome analogy. We are not truly at that stage. Remember, in order for the hyenas to eat him, Scar had to be removed from power first. Why? Even when they realized they were played they #8217;d still supported and respected the power that came from the Pride( wink, pride, wink). Just like Scar, the orange Diarrhea we have for President is all about the promise of  #8220;winning bigly #8221;, so the moment be starts to lose, the shitty magic around him will start to disappear. So be cognizant of this: The moment you vote him and his cohort out of office. Hyenas in the republican party will rush to try and eat him whole and try to rebrand themselves as being secretly against him even when enabling his dangerous government policies. Don #8217;t be surprised if Pence comes out as the person secretly writing op-eds stating to be secretly against him and his agenda. Do not let them. Vote them all out on this election and the next election. Trumpism must go!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh there is plenty. Let #8217;s see. Those who are racist tend to live in fear of those who they are racist against. That #8217;s unhealthy. Those who suffer from racist pigs, tend to suffer health related effect of racism as well. Those who are racists always think that those who they are racists against will do the same thing to them. In fact, that #8217;s whole basis for the racism, fear. In other words, they are chicken shits. Not only that, racism is bad for the economy. Not developing a part of your populations due to racism is hurting your own economic future. Racism is bad for the elderly. Why? If you have been a racist all of your life, and then you end up in a nursing home that employees people of color, your racist ass is rather fucked. Why? Because you can #8217;t do shit but wait to die while you see people color living their lives and doing something it with while you just wait and die an undignified life. It is most likely that your grand children want nothing to do with you, for being a racist asshole. Racism gives you, the racist, a general feeling of unhappiness, anxiety, gives you depression, paranoia, insomnia, and a slew of other diseases. It does the same for those who are victims of said racism. It is almost as if fear and hate are bad for one #8217;s health. Anti-racist people have a larger friend pool to pick from, are exposed to difference of opinions, tend to travel more, to live better lives, to have better sex to be healthier. Give it a try. It works for me like you wouldn #8217;t believe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Want me to have hope? Prosecute police officers who murdered Daniel Shaver. Breonna Tailor, Elijah McClain, Philando Castille, Zachary Hammond, and many others. I will have hope when police reform is implemented across the nation. Here are some simple suggestions: - don #8217;t killed unarmed people - deescalate the situation as much as humanly possible - body cameras must be turned on at all times and the videos made public in less than 24 hours of a police related shooting. - Make police officers work records public. This will help weed out bad apples. - eliminate qualified immunity. - demand more training for police offices in de-escalation, multiculturalism, race relations, and mental health. - demand police officers live near the areas they served as a way to build buy-in to the community. - implement a mental health department for police officers to ensure they are emotionally healthy while serving on the job. - implement a subsection of the police designed to help in situations where mental health is the underlying factor. - make changes to the power of police unions to intervene in cases of abuse of force. Hell! Do half of that and I will be hopeful. Otherwise, get out of here with police propaganda bullshit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is all noise. Changing the race of the characters do not hurt, or improve a show. Chief could be south Asian for all I care.. this only affect people who are bothered by what they see as social justice shit. Let creatives be creatives. The game is the game TV is TV. If we continue dictating how se want a source material to go, we won #8217;t have many series based on material we like. It will become too risky. This person is clearly not black. I live around black people and I will tell you this: A black person wouldn #8217;t give two flying fucks who plays captain Keys, or Miranda. You know what most of my friends of color care about? THAT THE SHOWS AREA GOOD! And that they are not portrait as a white sexual fantasy or stereotype.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol. You are clearly not affected by police brutality. My hunch is you just wanna continue with your life and pretend shit isn #8217;t happening. How can there be peace unarmed people are literally being and killed without a fair trial? How can there be peace when police reform hasn #8217;t taken place? How can there be peace when people are murdering other people seemingly because of their skin color, and their only excuse is  #8220;I fell threatened #8221;? You don #8217;t want peace, you want complacency. Colin Kapernick was literally protesting peacefully and people got him expelled from the sport he loved for it. MLK literally peacefully protested and he was murdered for it. Breonna Taylor was literally sleeping in her own apartment. Bothan Jean was literally eating ice-cream inside his house. If you want long lasting peace, police needs to be reformed. Falsely calling the cops on someone needs to be seriously penalized. If you don #8217;t see this is right and fair, then you are literally the problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol! It #8217;s funny how we all make our own version of reality. Take the BLM movement. It is a movement to eliminate militarization of police and minimize the murder of black people at the hands of police. YET depending on who you believe, you will see it as a communist group, or a nazi group(if that even make sense). Take the NRA, some would see it as a gun rights organization, others as a military industrial complex lobby. Nobody in america wants to take others rights. In fact both sides want to expand rights to whom they think deserve them. Take the abortion debacle. Some would say it would be taking rights away from women, others would say it gives rights to the unborn. The truth is both side want to give rights so someone. The problem is the mentality of winner takes all, or zero-sum game. In America, the moment one party or group takes a stand, someone literally has to take the opposing side, even when both agree on one point or another. Example of this? Affordable Care Act. It was actually a republican led idea. All of it. Romney implemented when he was governor. Yet, the moment a democrat implemented it, the right had to oppose it.</TEXT>

You are literally hitting a ball with a stick. Whatever pleasure you derive out of it, that #8217;s up to you. Now, again, yes this may be a difficult task. But think of it as a 20-21 year old and people are literally praising you for it. It will definitely mess with your head, when suddenly people stop hating you for fucking women who literally threw themselves at you for hitting a ball with a stick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually don #8217;t. I #8217;ve play sports before, baseball, basketball, hell even football(soccer). But all of these games in their most basic sense are just people chasing after balls. Nothing wrong with them, just how I #8217;ve always seen them. You could probably tell that I #8217;m not as passionate for sports as other people. But I #8217;m like that about religion, politics and pretty much anything. Let #8217;s just say I was born with a hater #8217;s gene. Maybe, I #8217;m just a critical thinker. But you could call me a hater. That #8217;s fine. Edit: Tennis, and water polo were also my sports when I was a kid. I just didn #8217;t developed a passion for playing made them part of my identity.. That #8217;s not to say I don #8217;t enjoy.

    <TEXT>Thank you Professor. To be honest, let them be hard on me. It was an idiotic question. still, it would be nice to know what the average would be if we were to remove the top 10 percent of income earners. By the way, I will ask another stupid question, not to cause a stir, but to genuinely learn some shit over here. How much credit does the current administration get for the median income being as high as it was, versus the previous administration? Should any of them even take credit for it? A few other questions are, given that the median household seemed to be at an all time high, what do you, humans smarter than me in the subject, see as the likelihood of us returning to such highs anytime soon? Lastly, should we raise taxes on the highest income earners as a leverage to get there?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started at 18, how ever it took me 10 years to get that fucking degree for several reasons. BUT, I got it! don #8217;t ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER give up on your academic dreams. Your story is unique to you, your challenges while similar to that of others are uniquely set for you to overcome them, and you can. The educational journey is not a cookie cutter type deal. Everyone #8217;s different. So go on and rock that shit. And while at it, motivate others to do so as well, for they can too achieve their educational dreams. Now, one thing I will advice you. Make sure you know and understand the level of debt you are about to incurre correlates with the earnings you are supposed to get out of your degree. This is something nobody told me, but I wish they had. I know someone with a degree in arts and their salary does not match the fancy degree and debt, they currently have. They told me if they had known, they would have gone to a cheaper school to get that degree. So there. Go on a rock this life of yours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fuck your definition of capitalism. They want to make bigger profits, then have them make a better product. Fucking Minecraft has the shitties graphics known to mankind and they made a killing. CDPR is still making money on the Witcher 3. These are games people love to play and spend money on. I pay 500 bucks for the privilege to play newer games with better graphics. Paying 70 for the base is just stupid. They could have slowly shafted me with 5 buck more, but 150 for two games, after playing 500? Fuck that. I #8217;d prefer to invest on a PC and skip a year on all new games and I save myself a shit ton of money and skip this fucking rat race. I will get older games with 4k resolution, game of the year editions and at a cheaper price. Besides Steam has better deals. In all fairness only microsoft would make me buy a console. They have an incredible deal with Gamepass ultimate. I can play my games on PC and console, AND with xCloud l, on my mobile device. All of that Plus XBOX live, mind you! All for less price of any cable subscription. So paying them a monthly fee to play any game I want is way more appealing than 70 per base games. Again, 65 bucks would have been a much more aceptable price range.</TEXT>

Minecraft made millions without charging an arm an a leg, fortnite is free and still made money. Hell! CDPR is still making money from Witcher 3 after all of these years, and now these companies want to charge 70 bucks for base games when they know they #8217;ll be pushing for battle passes, DLCs and even loot boxes. What I love about playing on PC is that I can play games from 5-8 years ago at a much cheaper price and still get better graphics than current gen consoles for a cheaper price.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The stock market is unrealistically high right now. Once(not if) Biden takes office, he will first have to deal with the disorganization left by the Trump admin. He might even have to leave some staff in som advisory capacity to explain the fuckery that took place. Then he will be forced to tell the actual Coronavirus death projections. Remember that the 250k deaths estimate was IF everyone followed the social distancing and lockdown guidelines. My hunch that the real number will be somewhere upwards of 600k in America Alone. This  #8220;shocking #8221; revelation, is likely to cause a hard correction in the stock market. For this correction, Biden will be blamed by the same people responsible for it. He will likely have to have recommendations to lock down once more and this will likely cause another correction. His saving grace will be a massive infrastructure bill, and a payout in unemployment insurance. For this, he will indeed be blamed as a socialist, becauseit #8217;s about the economy stupid! #8221; all over again. He might even raise taxes on the very wealthy(another potential down on the markets). Republicans, in the meantime will enter in election mode by to take the house in 2022, and with their newly acquired supreme court majority and their hundreds of new judges, they will sue the biden government up to their noses. And did I forget the many Trump related cases that will come up? So it will indeed be a bumpy ride when Biden wins this election. People will be disappointed and frustrated. The economic numbers will look shitty as fuck, but I have hope. Biden was part of the longest economic recovery in American history(2009-2020). He will have a team of professionals with him with actual experience in Governance, unlike the posers we have running the show right now. Lastly we have the superpower that we can print our own currency and it is valid so they will indeed have the money to pay for it all. Don #8217;t forget though, republicans will try and bring their  #8220;debt and deficit #8221; bullshit argument to the front once again. The same argument they completely forgot about when they gave themselves and their supporters a massive taxcut. So we need to be aware of it also. Lastly, we need to remember that there are literally ISIS type radicals on the right and they will try and setup protests, cause riots of their own, and likely mass shootings are coming back in full force(those fuckers are crazy). So what we need to do is hold the line, and be hopeful. We #8217;ve won wars, beaten recessions and depressions. We can beat this whole shitty mess if we are hopeful and follow the professionals, and scientists leading the charge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remember bois and gurls. During mario 64, we came from 2d to 3d. That shit felt rebolutionary. With today #8217;s gaming, we have beautiful games galore, starting with the Witcher, to Assassins creed Origins, Horizon Zero dawn, mass effect andromeda(game play aside). So when we encounter a game that doesn #8217;t feel as beautiful, it #8217;s because we have been primed to see already incredible graphics. Matching that expectation is hella difficult compared back when Zelda Link of the past was considered an incredibly beautiful game. I venture say that after playing through Zelda Ocarina of time the first time around, if the graphics didn #8217;t match or beat that game, the graphics felt off. It happened to me, at least.</TEXT>

He just have to make it look like there was some degree of cheating for him to cause a constitutional crisis. Remember boys and girls, these ballots in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin, just happened to show up discarded in heavily republican districts. This means that by logic Trump votes are likely to be the majority of the ones discarded. Not only that, some of these, were originally discarded because they were invalidated for some legitimate reason. Almost as if he #8217;s been queuing his people to gently cause some appearance of cheating even if with invalidated ballot to make sure the decision of the election is left for his  #8220;conservative majority #8221; supreme court to decide.

    <DATE>2020-09-27 14:30:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Exactly what the title says. If you know the park rules, you know kids play in the park, elderly walk in the park and you decide to unleash your dock and let them roam freely, you are an entitled piece of shit. Why? You (leash-less pieces of shit) are the reason so many dogs are put down. Because of you children get bit, people fall, dogs get hit by cars, their dogs get bitten by snakes(in some areas), and a why a lot of critters die unnecessarily. You are one of the reasons there is a literal shit ton of dog poop in parks. Because, clearly, you didn #8217;t see your dog pooping These people think letting their dogs roam free is some form of showcasing their  #8220;freedom loving lifestyle #8221;. They tend to think that because their dog is friendly with THEM, that the animals will be friendly with every other person and animal they encounter. But that is so ridiculously far from reality. I have seen several dog fights for this same reason in this month alone and have had family members get bitten because of  #8220;friendly dogs #8221; get excited(more like aggressive) when meeting someone new. This behavior only show cases how entitled they are, how inconsiderate they are to other people, and how removed from reality they are. If I had my way, these trashy people would get their dogs taken away, when caught by authorities breaking park rules, and fined with a hefty fine for endangering their own animals and the public rid large.</TEXT>

And dogs often times, go ahead in trails and do their deed and people don #8217;t even notice or even care to pick up after their pets. I frequently see poop on trails and have seen people with their unleashed dogs not picking up after them. They even pretend not to see it. It #8217;s disgusting, really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nobody is truly saying that you can't speak on issues of race. What minorities have been saying for years is that you are unlikely to understand what it's like to be bullied for shit you had nothing to do with(like being born black, Asian, white, etc) if you are born white, than any other racial group. In America for instance, there is what is known as a "racial caste system" where people from around the world come in and they are over time forced to pick sides between one racial culture or another. This happens primarily between blacks and whites, but it also happens with other cultures. white Hispanics, for instance, get usually told they are "too white to be Hispanic, or are you sure you aren't mixed?", black Hispanics experience the same shit but with their blackness, and so on. Because in the American mind Hispanic is brown-skinned "native-looking Mexican". So again, if you are born white, it is extremely unlikely that people will make you feel anything other than a person, but if you are born everything else, someone will most likely remind you that you are that. I have never experienced this discrimination in my life, but I have family members married to people of color from Africa, and they how told me how shocked they were how other people put them in a box instantaneously as "African American", simply because of their skin color. No white American can relate to this, at least not in America. So a white person coming in and trying to school people on said issue is just stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Motion pictures(movies and TV) have been around for at least 4-5 generations(lost, greatest, boomers, x, millennials and Zoomers all watch TV) , videogames have been around for up to 3 generarions(X, Millennials, and zoomers). So in the minds of older generations videogames were for kids( they look Cartoonish, they leverage fantasy, have super heroes, etc). The reality is that both mediums offer the same escape from realoty. Videogames, however tend to be ore addicting than watching a series. A videogame tends to also take longer than most seasonal TV series(think Game of thrones with 10-12 episodes of 45 mins each, vs the Witcher3 with between 90-200 hours of gaming content). Now when we add online multiplayer component games are indeed more demanding of your attention( you can #8217;t pause). So one has to stay in the match without pause for longer than if one is watching a movie at home. Here is another one, videogames, even with multiplayer are less social than watching movies in the eyes of older generations. Why? Because to watch a movie with someone, they must be present. To play a game, you don #8217;t. My hunch is that when the Coronnials become gamers none of those taboos about videogames will be even considered. Games will be like radio for all the aforementioned generations. They #8217;ve always been there. Side point. I truly have noticed that if you spent your whole day listening to music, instead of the watching TV or playing games, people tend to look fondly at that. At least older people, because that #8217;s what they used to do when they were young.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is such a tiresome argument. Most people don #8217;t say that because you are  #8220;white #8221; your argument is invalid. What people do say is, there is no way would completely understand what is like to be bullied by a whole fucking society that doesn #8217;t look like you, because everyone in your whole fucking social network looks like you. Therefore, I as a white person coming in and telling a black friend that I understand her struggle, is invalid. No I do not. I don #8217;t even have to think I #8217;m white most of the time. She is reminded of her blackness all the time. Not only that, as she has puts it  #8220;If you fuck up, you are just a fucked up person.

    <TEXT>Actually, what I would do is to try and put my critical thinking hat here and try and understand your perspective before judging you. For instance, I would ask: - Are you a woman? - are you white? - what is it about black men  #8220;ogling #8221; that bothers You? - Is it because they are men? - Or is it because they are  #8220;black men #8221;? - would you feel the same way if it was white guys? And if we come down that what truly bothers you is that black men checking you out specifically, produces some sort of discomfort to you, then we can clearly say. Race and tolerance may be an issue you need to deal with, my friend. If we determine your issue is with men, and due to the historical abuse women have suffered under patriarchal societies, i would try and understand, but never try to mansplain shit to you. Hell, we may even determine that what you have is agoraphobia, and you are just afraid groups of people. BUT I will never try and say that I completely, unequivocally understand your unique position as a white woman in America. That would be foolish and even sexist of me to do.</TEXT>

Most of them didn #8217;t even survive a month in the plantations in which they were enslaved. Saying that 85% was a high survivability rate is fucking cruel. These humans were kidnapped, chained for months, dehumanized, raped, maimed, and worked to death. They saw their children being raped, they saw their family members being taken away from them, they didn #8217;t know or even understood the language yet they were being beaten and killed for not complying to the commands given to them.

    <TEXT>I explained this to someone the other day. It has to do with how generations consume media. See, tv is the oldest motion pictures form of entertainment, that means that from the lost generation through baby boomers through zoomers, we all grew up watching some form of motion picture. However only very late Gen X, Millennials, and zoomers grew up with videogames as one of the options. Most silenters, greaters and boomers bought videogames as kid entertainment systems, and for them videogames will always be anything but kids toys. This apply also apply for a relative majority of older Gen Xers. Here is the funny thing, though. These people(greatest gen, boomers, primarily)0 look down on teenagers and some young adults playing videogames, because they see it as not doing much. BUT if they see the same people spending their whole day listening to music of their time, they will look at it with fondness, because that was their form of entertainment. That was their scape. My hunch is that when the Coronnials become teenagers, people will view videogames as just another form of entertainment, and not look down on it, and likely VR or something akin to, will be the kids toys of their time. i can see it  #8220;son why are you always alone in your room with that fucking headset on your head, get out and play with your friends! #8221;  #8220;But mom, all my friends are playing VR with me! #8221; As for me, I #8217;m an older millennial, I was poor and took the brunt of the bullying for preferring videogames than watching returns of the same fucking shows, or go outside in the middle of fucking winter. Not gonna lie though, those years of bullying do make me ashamed to say loudly that I love video games with a passion, some times. My children won #8217;t have that problem though. And that, to me, is progress.</TEXT>

You act as if the French, the Spaniards, Portuguese, Dutch and English didn #8217;t bring slaves to the American continent. Germans had slaves as well at some point. And the italians had or participated in slavery and colonization as well. All of western Europe participated and benefited to some degree or another. All became immensely rich stealing, murdering, kidnapping, enslaving, raping and maiming people of Afro, and native origins. The US of A is Just one country on a whole continent, and slavery involved three continents. Wake the fuck up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Never said that. I am american myself. However, America is indeed a whole continent. That #8217;s like the English capturing the European name for themselves, the Nigerians taking the African title, or the Chinese doing the same with  #8220;Asian #8221;. I guess more context is needed. Something I just learned and find interesting that in Latin America, Americans are addressed as  #8220;Estadounidenses #8221;, in the same manner that Colombian call themselves colombianos, and Citizens of New York call themselves newyorkers. This would be akin to us calling ourselves  #8220;UnitedStatesans #8221;. This to me, is rather fitting because indeed we are the citizens of the United States of America, and don #8217;t represent the whole of the continent. I decided to do some digging and found that we do not have any other official name other than American. Given that there aren #8217;t any, and American is rather vague(again Canadians are Americans in the way Germans are European), I thought to ask the question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of, sex traffic is disgusting, and should be taken with the upmost seriousness. Clarification: the Little girls movie is french. Disgusting, but not American. Now with regards to your point. I disagree. America does have some fucked things that it needs to Address, and should be on the table alongside the top issues: 1- The massive income inequality in the country. America has regions that are as poor and under developed as some African or Latin American regions. Just look at the native American reservations, and some of America #8217;s ghettos. This has been so for almost a hundred or more years. 2 - Massive racial disparities on how America polices it #8217;s citizens. This goes alongside the first point. If you are in debt, and do not have resources to pay for a damn good lawyer, Bail, and look a certain way, you are likely to have thrown the book at you. Even if you have all the resources, having a certain  #8220;profile #8221;, is likely going to adversely affect you in a court of law. Justice system reform is needed. This has been documented. 3 - The immense disparities in education. I will venture and say that cuts to education and the disparities in education, are among the primary reasons for the why the country #8217;s knee deep in this Coronavirus shit. People need to be taught STEM, personal finance, and Civics, for them to be more competitive, stop being in such debt, and know how their fucking government actually works. 4 - Debt! Almost everyone in America is up to their ears in debt of one kind or another. That mortgage, those car payments, that student loan payments, hell even that smartphone monthly payment you make, all go and belong, to the banks. Not an anti capitalist here, but damn, we are all mostly broke. Thar has to change. How long until our debt  #8220;house of cards #8221; comes crumbling down? 5 - A biological and climate collapse. We #8217;ve all seem the fires, the increase in hurricanes, the massive snow storms, and the droughts. If there was anything close to the apocalypse, this issue would be it. It doesn #8217;t matter if you are rich or poor, black, asian or white, jews, christians, or muslims. when the climate finally gets so fucked up that there #8217;s no reverse, we will all pay for it. So yes, sex traffic must be at the top of the list, close second, third and so forth should be the ones I just mentioned.</TEXT>

Everything else is noise. The millionaires I met were all driven people, some of them were decent people. But they were focus on one thing only Maximizing their time/gains. Everything outside of that is noise. Climate change? Concerning! Let others worry about it. Forest fires? What #8217;s our contingency plan? We have it? Good! Let others worry about the fires. Mass shootings? Horrible, does it affect my bottom line? No? Let others worry about it. Some would put money where their mouth is. But at the end of the day, they are putting in the money so OTHERS take care of it while they continue to maximize gain/time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it makes sense. This has been one fucked up year, so a lot of people are stressed out of their minds(me included) about this whole fuck up. Then ere is the issue of debt. Here in US people don #8217;t really own much with mortgage, car payments, credit debt, and the most disturbing of all student loan debts, weigh heavily on American #8217;s minds every day. And the banks don #8217;t really care enough to forgo some of the debt in order to help the little people. So in that environment, a prolonged shut down, would cause a lot of societal ills to a shit ton of people. Imaging losing the flat(apartments here in Murica) in the middle of winter and you live in fucking Detroit, Berlin, or Moscow for that matter. What the fuck will you do? Couple that with this new wave of hyper partisanship, a new threat of fascism and conspiracy theories galore to cause more panic, and I #8217;ll venture say this winter is bound to be the toughest in generations for millions of people. Edit: that is not to say that they should lock down. They should, until they control the spread. But they also need to provide people with economic reprieve and assurances that they won #8217;t lose housing during until there is an available cure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can only speak from an American point of view. People need trigger warnings because the American mental health sector suck balls. First it is fucking a fucking societal taboo to say you are seeing a therapist. Specially for men. A man says he is seeing a psychologist, he might as well had said that he #8217;s a serial killer. People tend to look down on men for being open about it, and disregard what they say as crazy talk. Second, finding a fucking professional takes fucking for ever. So a shit ton of people give up even trying. Third, America has a shit ton of people with PTSD, from Child abuse, as veterans, or rape, and for simply being a member of a minority group( because, you know? America has a truly racist, homophobic, and misogynistic history, it really does). So a trigger warning helps people re-live those moments they #8217;ve untreated. So with that in mind, sure why the fuck no? IMHO, If you get irked by them, you are most likely not in any of the aforementioned groups. Additionally if you don #8217;t feel any empathy for any of it, You may be in need of a mental health checkup yourself, as you may have sociopathic tendencies you need addressing.</TEXT>

Hell it #8217;s happening all over the globe. Nobody is speaking about the Canadian tar sands, or their gold operations across the globe, which are destroying forestry. Now, the problem with the Amazon is that it literally helps regulate the planet #8217;s climate. So destroying it is akin to releasing a huge nuclear bomb. What brazil should be doing is using it as leverage.  #8220;Don #8217;t want to see it gone? Then invest here in education, technology, eco tourism, etc #8221;. In terms of natural resources, Brazil, DR Congo, canada, and Russia, are amongst the most power nations in the world. But only Canada and Russia seem to be at the top, in my list. Nothing against them, but governments should put interest in preserving natural resources by lifting the people that live near, and depend on said resources, specially in poor countries.</TEXT>
