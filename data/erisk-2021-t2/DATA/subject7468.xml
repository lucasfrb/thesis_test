    <TEXT>I have tried to kill myself before. I survived, even tho I wish I haven #8217;t. I am trapped in the life that I did not choose to be born into. All of the journey, joy and sorrow- aren #8217;t my choice. I did not start it, did not want it so I should be free to end it Only thing that stops me in these last 2 years- the feeling guilt that envelopes me when I imagine my family finding out that I am dead+ my plans of becoming doctor, raising up good members of society But deep down I hate my existence I wish I wasn #8217;t born at all And I am sure that the thought of taking my life away will creep back next time when I will feel trapped or hopeless or abandoned/rejected again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello :) Writing it as last year dental student 1. A periodontal disease doesn #8217;t have to be with presence of inflammation always. You said your gums do not bleed that is something really good, shows that you don #8217;t have active inflammation in your gums 2. You might periodontosis (dystrophy of periodontium without inflammation) yet X-ray picture is needed to put final diagnosis 3. For the space between your teeth, it can be corrected by braces or simple restoration Tell me please, do you have Mobility of teeth? If yes, to what degree Do you feel itchiness in your gums? About anxiety I am dentist to be and have done lots of procedures on patients, but yet I am scared of dentists myself, I have insecurities in my mouth too. But to be honest with you, I have never judged a patient for the state of their oral cavity, do not worry, no dentist will roast because of your mouth :)</TEXT>

However I found a way to deal with it I tell it to the girl, explain ask her to have a conversation, and foreplay touching her, playing with her all these things start numbing my brain and I get erected. Btw I am 21 too About the condom- This shit happens to me too, sometimes when I put the condom it can just go off, but I do the same ask the girl to have some foreplay and it helps + don #8217;t be hard on yourself, don #8217;t worry you are fine.

    <TEXT>Dentist to be (in like 2 months) We had short course of forensics but I in that short period of time I have witnessed and took part in 8 autopsies (they let me in because my brother is a chief forensic expert in other city) The most shocking parts for me 1. The way they were pulling out the tongues ( they do it from throat, not from oral cavity. After making a big incision around thyroid ligament they drag out the tongue downwards) 2. Once a forensic inspector cut small part of liver of victim and gave it to me as a memory ( I threw it on my way back home, because it was creepy to have part of other human being in your backpack) 3. Once they took out organs they stuff the abdominal cavity with clothing #8217;s and make super ugly sutures that we #8217;re looking scary 4. Trepanation of skull and cutting the breast bone with huge scissors... I won #8217;t forget the sounds these 2 procedures were making. Colddd</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello! Soon I am graduating from university as a young dentist. Throughout my education I was a dedicated student and finished my university with good grades. I speak English, German, Russian fluently and ukrainian ( medical vocabulary and communicative skills in all these languages) Do you think I should return to Azerbaijan? All my relatives, especially my parents wait for me to come back and continue my life there. Judging from media and my past experiences/memories I have a really skeptical view on this  #8220;returning to homeland #8221; thing... Give me reasons to go back to Azerbaijan, seeking for motivation to return back(cuz I have 000 will, but lots of pressure)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have strong points, but I am not of a  #8220;great #8221; person to change society or leave a trace on history or something. My decency ? I don #8217;t think that someone needs it. Our society likes qaqash on big SUV, not decency. whenever I visit Azerbaijan in holidays. I swear I get anxious and ashamed from what I see on streets. Improving what? People are complaining that they don #8217;t even have water in their flats yet the government did a lockdown. Society of Azerbaijan needs deep changes that should come from people who rule them. No matter how sophisticated you are, you won #8217;t be noticed in a society where the values that are important for you, majority will not even consider it as a thing. I love my country and I always try to represent it in the best way to foreigners. I guess that will be only influence I will have to upon my native community , a positive feedback on me will be a positive feedback to Azerbaijan because majority of people who know me , don #8217;t even know what is my name, they just remember me as  #8220;guy from Azerbaijan #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Peace is eventual. Look at Germans and Jews, or Polish people and Germans. After all that happened they are not loading their children #8217;s head with hatred. I believe that children growing up with stories of blood shed and how pregnant women were slaughtered- they won #8217;t have a clear mind, healthy psychology. I believe that it is the case in Armenia too, they are teaching you propaganda against turks(Azeri) and u have a life time hatred. For me personally, what I want is people to go back to their motherlands. I have lots of friends who when I ask  #8220;How do your relatives do in your village #8221; ( we ask such questions) their answer  #8220;M #601;n erm #601;nistanliyam #8221; which means  #8220;I am from Armenia #8221; it basically says that my village is under occupation.

    <TEXT>I checked it in English yes it looks quite violent I agree. But I would like to ask why there were Armenians in Sumgayit? And is it really a fair comparison between two event 1. Armenians kill Azerbaijanis people in their own land in order to occupy it 2. Azerbaijanis kill Armenians in Sumaqayit after propaganda of Armenians themselves in there ? You should take a deeper look into it and check the facts which initiated this event... In any circumstances loss lives are reason for sorrow because we have enough food, territory and love in us to share it among each other.</TEXT>

We got tossed because there are some generals in high statuses which are agents, it Is being investigated rn.

Presence of agents in army is because Azerbaijan have had some Armenians leaving in the territory and they are descendants of these people. Towards the end of 1992 russia heavily aided Armenia with artillery it is a fact If you think that we are incompetent please go check the  #8220;war of the 4 days in April #8221; again By the way I like how Armenians always deviate from the main topic, I put picture of a dude literally coming to a peaceful army with a fucking sign of a terrorist organization and you are talking about completely irrelevant topics</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wife of Polad Hashimov(General who became martyr at last attacks of Armenia)  #8220;Every time after payday he was coming straight back home. I was keeping the list of monthly groceries. He used to give the needed money for groceries and spare the rest of it for building bathrooms or fixing the roads for soldiers. He would even take the soap for dishwashing that was at home for his soldiers and say  #8220;Their hands become ulcerated let them use this #8221;. He worked as troop commander in Dashkesen for a while. It was so cold there that clothes were taking month to become properly dry. He was giving out his own warm cotton sweaters to his soldiers and had only one left for himself. He gained the love of the nation not with his status but with his actions. He even gave away the house that was presented for him to a family of a martyr, about this We found out after his death. We were collecting money to buy our own house, it was or dream. Even the house we live is not yet fully paid. In order to not stress I wasn #8217;t talking about all these, because he was worrying about his soldiers as well. #8221;</TEXT>

Not to forget about the YPG, PKK, ASALA terrorist groups which still persuade malicious acts within borders of T #252;rkiye. These groups include armenians as well, they are strongly financed by USA.

I am terribly sorry for your experience, I had the same, yet not from a suicide hotline but from a  #8220;close #8221; friend who just mocked me and told me to man up... yes I tried to kill myself but failed it and I hope I never hit the bottom like that time. Our lives are precious, we are unique with the flows we have. About young lads who might consider suicide- fk it no matter the reason behind your sorrow, misery is- you are bigger than that! Family issues ? Fk the family , leave it, go homeless, find a job that gives place to sleep/eat and build your life, relationship problems ? Fuck your partner that doesn #8217;t appreciate you, never hurt yourself over a person. You feel guilty ? Check if you are already forgiven, if not than first forgive yourself than ask for forgiveness again, it will change everything. Live your life don #8217;t hurt yourself</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude I don #8217;t even live in Azerbaijan for last 7 years..)) What do you mean ? That Azerbaijani soldiers killed their own people..? Do you even comprehend what you are typing ? Of course I will response, because I have national consciousness and Armenians always tend to dehumanize and make us look like some kind of freaks yet it is completely different. You don #8217;t even know Azerbaijanis and you don #8217;t want to face who we are I see everywhere you talk abt coco cola shit like we just eve dropped from sky.. dude we are Turks . It does not matter when the goverment was formed but we have been present since centuries. Yet Azerbaijani people who are currently located in territory of Azerbaijan (excluding me, I have no mixture with Iran roots because I am Karapapak Turk ) have mixture with Persian roots due to geographical approximate . Ugh You won #8217;t understand because you have closed your heart, eyes and mind towards us. Especially people like you are the real barriers for peace. You won #8217;t face the realities ever.

Azerbaijan is multicultural country with Lezgi, Talish, Tat, Jews ( check tankist Albert) even Armenians in Baku. Know one thing- they all live in prosperity and all of them are ready to sacrifice their lives. If Armenia doesn #8217;t want their young sons to die, they should allow them to toss away the weapons that they are given and go back to their families. There is only one peaceful solution- Qaraba #287; should be returned. If not returned- than reclaimed by force. Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am sorry that for one period of your life you had to spend nights at street. I hope you are doing better now. You might need remineralization therapy and systemic intake of calcium, vitD, magnesium and calcium. Look for drugs with such combination. Irradiating pain might mean( and most likely to mean) some form of pulpitis or even apical periodontitis (impossible to differentiate without x-ray) Do you have gum bleeding? Do your gums look larger than usual, in swollen manner? For now what you can do: Do not take ibuprofen more than 2 times a day and important to it something prior taking any NSAID. Get a mouthwash (Colgate, Listerine, any) Buy soft tooth brush if you have gum bleeding Avoid - Acidic content , too cold or hot, so you avoid the triggering factors</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your kids should sit at home and your goverment let Azerbaijan take what is his. A dead soldier- it is okay. Doctor who treats a patient with COVID 19 gets infected- also okay In Azerbaijan that #8217;s how we think. Azerbaijan have been trying to resolve issue in piece for 30 years. Our brother Turkey have never interrupted these protocols and meetings even tho Turkey is capable of wiping out Armenia (which is not okay I know lots of well educated civil armenians I even had a chance to be in same company with them couple of times) yet they never demonstrated their supremacy over this situation and they still not it is Armenia who is trying to involve Turkey in this by saying that brother Turkey have hit your Su25 it is absolute nonsense, believe me Azerbaijan doesn #8217;t need Turkeys support to fight Armenia we are oil rich country with strong, disciplined army. One thing certain- Azerbaijan doesn #8217;t need terrorist groups to fight in our side if we will really need someone it will be for sure Turkish soldiers who will be ready to die for us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Armenia is invading internationally recognized Azerbaijan lands. Azerbaijan have been trying to solve the issue peacefully for 30 years. In these 30 years armenia have violated rules of ceasefire dozens of times and last time they did it- our MOD did counter attack that evolved into large artillery. Armenia is trying to involve Turkey in this by saying that they shot their S25 with F16 but it is absolute non-sense. They have been accusing Azerbaijan for using jihadists but it was proven to be fake as well. First things first Azerbaijan has majority of population Shia and extremist groups will not fight for Azerbaijan.</TEXT>

It is your army who hides behind civilians and when they get killed  #8220;turks are killing us #8221;. Recently there was a video circulating where armenian civilians helping soldiers to load a gun. If they get killed you will accuse us with committing war crimes. Ridiculous, siz gijd #305;lla #287;s #305;z  #246;z #252;m  #246;l #252;m adam olmayacaqs #305;z . InshaAllah when we reclaim Karabakh all armenians civilians will remain in their houses and no one will be harmed, just like Fatih Sultan Mehmet when he conquered Istanbul, did not harm the local citizens of Istanbul, did not destroy historical architecture. Turks are noble race, hopefully one day hays will stop being a butthurt and come to good terms with us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>M.S student of Ortho here. It can happen to several reasons: humidity on tooth (bad isolation, over excited patient with lots of saliva discharge) or bad quality of UV light. One more thing that I have observed is that if you have a crown or artificial tooth, the composite tends to have weaker shear bonding strength and it might lead to this. Nothing to worry just go to your fellow orthodontist , don #8217;t be hard on them ortho is sucking our souls anyways+ when patient complains I feel like straight jumping out of window like dude I am already dying here</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, plaque builds up quite fast with or without wires, yet wires make it faster since the regular tooth brushes can #8217;t reach certain areas. If you can afford, get a tooth paste that is special for tender gums and also a orthodontic tooth brush. Avoid acidic food (also includes lemons, oranges etc.) sodas, hard food where when you bite the food will touch your gums (like apple or hard bread) keep it soft, clean</TEXT>

Your dentist must inform you throughly what is going to happen to you and wether you are fine with it. Dental Hygienist supposed to clean any dental biofilm, use airflow, special paste, polishing... just a quick air polish is not professional oral hygiene. About the bleaching.. it is indicated in case you have a non-vital darkened tooth.. I am so surprised by method of treatment of your dentist.. bleaching whole dental row ?

We did not end our relationships in the best way there is part of my soul still in her I miss her everyday, yet I am trying to get over it and not interrupt her life because I know that there is no more hope for us and if we reunite it will not take much... 1 month, 2 month and another painful break up. So don #8217;t visit her profile, let her go, don #8217;t stalk. Delete old photos. All chats. Remove items which will remind of her. Life goes on, with her or without her. I am writing this to you, but I am not yet able to do all of it myself (except the stalking part because I can not bear seeing her with another man, at least this soon. Even though I will be glad that she is happy hence I pray for her everyday)</TEXT>

Waking up to memories with her , putting myself to sleep imagining her sleeping right next to me like we used to do. Remembering her at scent of a flower, in sound of water and and at blow of air. Ever love song, sad or happy. Yet I let her go. There is no hope, I don #8217;t want to be in endless loop of reunion and break up. Yet I suffer. I find my eyes get wet in subway just by thinking about her. I miss her when I drive, cook, buy groceries I miss her in my every breath in and breath out but there is no way back, farewell shawty. You will forever own a piece of me that I can never take back. Love you, yet I hope this will fade away too..</TEXT>

It is not in their interests and if they start saying  #8220;that is turkish, that is not Turkish) they will have to fight with all present day countries since Turkey is descendant of Ottoman Empire. About Borchali yea there are loooots of Turks in there (Azerbaijanis). I have visited Marneuli, Dmanisi, Bolnisi several times and saw how Bazaars are full of Turks and people speak more Azerbaijani Turkish than Georgian. Yet Azerbaijan will not start saying that Georgia is invading  #8220;Dmanisi #8221; because there are Azerbaijanis are living. Hence, if you see Ilham Aliyev visiting Dmanisi and writing on top of it  #8220;Borchali #8221; you would have been Triggered , rightfully.</TEXT>

It was so hard to separate Otaci from Mogilev Podilsky as there was only 1 river between them and people were crossing it freely during USSR and than they had to separate these two cities.

    <TEXT>Dude.. u calling Turks barbars? Have you ever heard of crusades ? Again on hay genocide When WWI began, Armenians formed militias to help the Russian advance into Anatolia. Large-scale uprisings in different parts of Anatolia, notably in the city of Van, created panic in the rear of the Turkish army. By February 1915, the local Muslim and Armenian populations in the country were in a fierce communal conflict. In April, the Ottomans were pulling back from the Eastern front and the Armenians were in control of certain provinces. At the end of April, the Ottomans gave the first order for  #8220;relocation. #8221; The following months witnessed the plight of Armenians: As they were transported to Syrian provinces of the empire, they were killed by attacks of local Muslims, gangs, hunger and epidemics  #8212; as well as the difficulties of moving through mountains and deserts of the region. In the provinces under Armenian control, atrocities of similar scale were taking place, and the Muslim population fled in huge numbers in order to save their lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t see the part where I wrote about life or death decisions stop dragging the topic on somewhere else. Education or academics degree have nothing to do about proper decision making. I justified the fact that we are fighting over our recently lost lands in Karabakh. Armenians have committed genocide towards Azerbaijanis in the region and caused ethnic cleansing to deliberately keep armenian population alone in NKA. Is your house a penthouse or just a suburb ? Does it matter what kind of house you have? If it gets invaded by enemies you would have fought for taking it back no matter what kind of home you had.</TEXT>

Lol once I posted a pic writing  #8220;Napaleon is my favorite armenian food #8221; and all ya fools fell for it and started writing some bullshit under that post untill you realized I was mocking you. Hhh Mmm sharing personal information on reddit ? It is completely fine, people write about how they shit themselves or how their parents caught them jerking off to bizarre stuff so.. I don #8217;t see what is wrong with that. I love animals but not to a level that I will go sexual with them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry but what do you what me to do? Follow armenian subs where they write that Jihadists are bombing Ganja ? Or listen to your PM who said that Syrian fighters are fighting with shop owners in Azerbaijan that they have to stop selling alcohol. Also the posts about Azerbaijan forcing ethnic minorities to war.. there are Russian and Jewish Azerbaijanis who are ready to give their lives for their motherland. Also Talishes, Lezgins, Chechens, Tats who live here. I don #8217;t know armenian Azerbaijanis but since they are obligated to serve, they will be deployed too.. the word propaganda is so controversial. For me propaganda is when you interpret the truth and manipulate it and show it to people. Yet Azerbaijan news showing the destructed buildings and taking interviews from casualties of yesterday attack of Ganja by Armenian MOD with ballistic missiles is not a propaganda cut is journalism and spreading the news. Btw check this Twitter of your countryman, this is real propaganda shit [Andronik Sasunyan](https://twitter.com/lapshanaushi?s=21)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My advice to avoid such topics if you are willing to have normal conversations. They are as patriotic as we are and no matter what kind of evidence we come up with they will just repeat their mindset and that #8217;s it. Non of them believe that they hit Ganja and what happened was planned by Armenian MOD</TEXT>
