    <TEXT>I'm looking for advice on how to pose a model who isn't used to modeling. I'm used to light edits on Lightroom but I tried using Photoshop to darken the background and make the subject pop using a brightness filter and masking out the subject. If you all have any advice on better methods of using Photoshop to highlight a subject I'd be interested to hear it! Sorry I realized in retrospect this was shot with the kit zoom lens at 29mm, F3.5, 1/400sec, ISO 3200. This explains why the background isn't very blurred.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the advice! I definitely will look into some high pass tutorials. It makes sense to try to get more shots without people to combine the images together. In the future I'll see if I can wait or just get to the location earlier without tons of people. As for poses I guess I better start scrolling through Instagram!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Using Event Photos in Your Portfolio</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-22 01:17:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone,  #8203; I wanted to know if I needed permission of everyone in the photos I've taken to post them on my website for portfolio and marketing purposes. I'm a new photographer when it comes to marketing myself and I often take event photos of dance competitions. Some of the dancers I know and can get their consent but I want to take into account the people in the background or photos of dancers I don't know. Sometimes competitors are also under 18 and I wonder if I should exclude them from my online portfolio as well. Or maybe I'm just being too paranoid. Thank you all for your advice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello to you all, I've been heavily considering whether or not I should take calculus before med school. I've been trying to find free comprehensive lists of med schools that require calculus but all I've found are these 2 links: [https://hpa.princeton.edu/sites/hpa/files/2017hpa-mathrequirements.pdf](https://hpa.princeton.edu/sites/hpa/files/2017hpa-mathrequirements.pdf) [https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/sites/dsa/files/handbooks/Medical%20Schools%20with%20Additional%20Math%20Requirements%2010\_11.pdf](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/sites/dsa/files/handbooks/Medical%20Schools%20with%20Additional%20Math%20Requirements%2010_11.pdf) These seem outdated and don't cover all the med schools.

    <TEXT>Hi there! I also own a Vanishing Point in Fine, and I noticed if I didn't hold the nib completely flat while writing it would feel quite scratchy. But if I rotate the pen and made sure the nib was not turned it would write smooth like butter. For me it was a matter of getting used to having the clip in the way as I hold my pen with my thumb on top of the pen. Just mess around with the pen as much as you can to see if you can get something to work before spending money or altering your pen in any way. If this doesn't work for you, it's possible to use a magnifier glass to see if the tines (the two parts of your nib) are misaligned. Or you could use a micro-mesh to smooth out the nib (which can be quite risky). Here is a tutorial if you were curious: [https://youtu.be/r35cV\_pe0-Q](https://youtu.be/r35cV_pe0-Q) Overall since using a micro-mesh voids your warranty and you're dealing with an expensive gold nib, going to a nibmeister may be your best bet if changing your writing angle doesn't work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Smoothest Fountain Pen Nibs Out There</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-10 15:34:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello r/fountainpens, I've been shopping for smooth nibs for awhile now and I was curious to know what you all thought are some of the smoothest nibs out there. Here is my experience so far \- Lamy 2000 in Medium is extremely smooth and writes very wet \- Pilot Vanishing Point Fine is also smooth and wet, but less than the Lamy 2000 \- Lamy Studio Fine is somewhat toothy with a decent amount of feedback. Has trouble writing under it's own weight \- Lamy Vista with 1.1 Steel Stub is quite smooth as long as you hold it correctly (don't dig the edges into the page) \- Pilot Metropolitan Fine is the smoothest steel nib I've tried. Writes just fine with it's own weight and no pressure \- Kaweco AL Sport EF has a decent amount of feedback but still feels smooth for an EF What are your thoughts and experiences? Do you find a significant difference between steel and gold nibs?</TEXT>

Going from a cold to warm place will expand the air in the pen and push out the ink. If the pen is full of ink there #8217;s less air to expand when the temp changes. Try keeping the pen at the same temp for a few days and see if the burping stops.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup! Gold EF! It #8217;s super smooth for an EF and pretty juicy. It has a touch of line variation but I #8217;m never going to flex this too much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine is still less than two weeks old, but I have polished it a couple times. I also think the lighting makes it look more shiny than it really is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Noodlers line up of pens are a good starting point. The Creeper, Ahab and Triple Tail are all pretty good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Kaweco nibs are pretty good but they only feel comfortable for me when you put the cap on the back. Other good starter pens include the Pilot Metropolitan (which is metal) and the Lamy Safari (which is plastic). The Lamy 2000 is an amazing pen but mine seems to write quite thick for a Medium. I recommend learning what nib sizes you like before investing in a pen like the 2000 only to find you don #8217;t like the line width.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love it so much! The smooth springy nib is great to write with. I did find the pen is so thick it couldn #8217;t fit into my smaller ink bottles (iroshizuku 15ml) so I had to buy a separate inkwell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Visconti EF is very springy and smooth with a hint audible of feedback. The Pilot F draws a finer line and is a bit less springy and very smooth with almost no feedback. The Lamy Studio F has noticeable feedback and is a tad less smooth than the other two.</TEXT>
