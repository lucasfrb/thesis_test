Every Sunday evening, a man came in by himself and sat at the same table, he always asked for a table for two but never came with anyone. After a few months of working there, i asked my manager about him. Turns out his wife had died (im not sure why but apparently she had some sort of illness nobody knew of), and this had been her favourite restaurant. before she died this was the last place they had eaten out, so the man comes here by himself in memory of her. I asked him if there was anything I could do for him, just a small favour or something. He said, "vote for trump! ". I don't support trump but I had to respect his wish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ignorance. if you are part of a subreddit just to hate on peoples interests then your wasting you time. It makes me sad to see ople are hating on anime, and then saying its ok because its just their opinion. I would be more inclined to n if you actually knew what you were talking about, and had experiences and evidence to back you up. However, this is clearly not the case at all. This subreddit (I quote) "truly consists of 8-12 year olds yelling at anime with no basic facts. You are strait hypocrites". I will not lie, are several downsides to anime. It is addictive, it give people unrealistic ideas aboutg and love and people are often disappointed at reality. From going as a kid to seeing really hot anime girls with h and cute faces being completely perfect, when you grow up and start dating for real, it is often quite difficult to be happy. In the real world, women have surgical scars, body hair, and other body imperfections which people forget about when watching the perfectly created anime girls. There is also the fact that it isnsuming and often extremely violeHowever, there are many plus sides to anime. I started watching a yearago becauseI starteto date a girl whwatuse I wante to know a about it, and to be imeshow and foun that I reall liked it. Our relationshi didn' last very lon thoug, but I left as a whole ne perso. many new frien after that uch a grea t discussing shows we liAnim isn't just th show, it really is a whole culture. I becaus we bot enjoye anime spending sometime togethe whil we fou out we shared so muchmore in com and is . Anime is liked across theworld f many reason. Ye, there are bad sides are reao to dislike it. One o best friends hate a, bu I respect his opinion ed abou it but isn't for everyon. As for this subreddit, cam here expecting a out the negatives of animeething which I ted to join in s I said before I don't like being ign I wanted eople have for me. However, this is clearly not the case, as this subreddit is full of 10 year olds taking the piss</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your comment gave me cancer anyway.</TEXT>

It's more about the fact that it brings people joy. Most of us know it's a repost, but it still made us smile because just look at how happy that toad is. The ones who've never seen it before will get the joy of seeing it, and the more it's upvoted the more likely it'll be seen by people who weren't online when it was new. The internet is a big pile of shitty content, and the occasional gem shifts to the top. Knowing what a gem is, and posting it on a Saturday morning, is clever and OP deserves our upvotes. Plus, something like this I don't see the original owners having planned to monetize. It does no harm to anyone to share that little happy moment. Personally, I find the monetized ones to be sad, and not having that original feeling even when brand new. The idea they had was always based on something that happened to someone else, and a copy is never as good. **Take joy in the moment**, because that's all we have in the end. If your having a bad day, it's even more important to let yourself feel, instead of lashing out. Maybe it's time to move on from your toxic ways, u/Bradley797.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i was doing the dishes but then i accidentally smashed a plate. So my mom threw the fucking fridge at me. Now she is blaming me for the broken fridge and she says I have to pay for it :( I'm really upset. My mom told me to make her a cup of coffee, but when i didn't add any cream she got out a fucking gun. Luckily I managed to dodge the shot. I'm really scared what should I do? If I try and call the police she might hear me and smash the phone. I might try and climb out the window and sprint to my uncle's house. It might be too risky tho. I'm currently hiding in our washing machine. Help is appreciated! Send help! Edit: she found me running on the street and shot me twice. Im bleeding and i think im gonna die. Please help. She is still talking abt how I have to pay for the fridge Edit 2: my right hand fell off. Typing with one hand will be hard but ill try Edit 3: its midnight Edit 6: i am on the plane to Norway to live with my great-grandfather. Edit 7: my plane is going to fucking crash. We are over the arctic circle and they are sending emergency broadcasts. Edit 8: my mom called me and told me shes forgiven me Edit 9: i no longer have to pay for the fridge :) Edit 14: Thanks for the support, everyone! Especially all those gold awards  #128523; #128513; yum Edit 11: I got PLATINUM! Thanks kind stranger! Edit 12: Thanks for the karma guys  #128517; #128536; #128525; Edit 13: Currently in hospital rn after I started noticing it's becoming quite difficult to move around efficiently. I may have to stop the edits soon if I'm no longer able to process language and/or move around. Or I may have a family member do it for me. I'll keep you guys informed. though I won't be active for a few days. Edit 15: Keep those gold awards coming guys! You're doing great! Maybe a few more of those PLATINUMS?  #129303; #128524; Edit 17: Sorry guys, but this is fake as fuck. I'm 14, but yah I love karma LOLOL  #128514; #129315; pranked  #128527; #128517;jajaja #128518; #129315;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey I would really love moderating the sub, I have some experience in removing spam and dealing with rule breakers. I've been in reddit for 5 1/2 months now and I have 254000 karma. I'm online for 2-3 hours every day (willing to put as much time into moderating as needed). Am also on discord (if needed). Could also improve the looks of page here and there, but I have no skills in css/coding. This would be perfect for me to gain some more experience in moderating, even if that's only for a month or so. All the best!</TEXT>
