    <TEXT>Thanks for watching the video. And I do agree with your comment that its a position upon an individual's situation. Tempered glass by nature is vulnerable at its edge. If it chips at the edge, the cracks will run right through, but in general its a fairly hard object. Hence its use as a building material or in furniture. The case I used is made by Spigen (forgot the model name) but is a decent one. The border is made of rubber and does not press against the phone or the screen protector for that matter with force. Which brings us back full circle, other cases (which there are many) may press against the edge of the screen protector too harshly. If the problem of protecting the edge is solved, trying out a tempered glass screen protector may well be worth it for those who has not tried it yet. It feels like there is nothing on the screen (as opposed to plastic screen protectors) Cheers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In most service stations you will see there are circular metal covers on the floor. Some large others about 6 inches. Under some of them are whats called dip sticks. Those are marked, often you may see very early in the morning or late at night the service station attendant reading the levels. So that is how the managers know how much fuel is there in the underground tanks. This process is getting automated these days with digital systems. Supply is still old fashioned fuel tanker trucks. They generally deliver pretty late at night. Reason is that the sheer size of the truck blocks up portion of the forecourt. Thus the station is loosing business due to the pumps that are closed. At night its not so bad. In some residential areas, when there is a noise restriction after hours, you may often see the tanker during the day. The truck may appear to have one tank on it, but in fact has compartments inside and carries various kinds of fuel, like diesel, premium, regular unleaded, etc all at once (LPG is generally a separate truck). The hose they connect to deliver the fuel are fairly wide and pumps fuel into the underground tank at a very high rate and different kinds all at once. Hence they are able to deliver massive quantities of fuel in about 20 to 30 mins. Some large service stations in busy roads may have two or three deliveries per day. Others may need only once in few days depending on need. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lunch Hour</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-02 14:49:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a meeting in about 30 minutes and would hate to present the sales pitch on an empty stomach. 15 minutes was all I had to spare and 15 minutes to rush back and prepare. Guess what, its lunch hour and every food shop in the city appears to have a long queues. Looking around saw a restaurant neon flashing in mid daylight. Though, that'll do. Went in, and it was packed, except there was a chair empty at a table on the other end of the busy restaurant hall. On the other chair on that table, behold, its my boss, yelling at the waiter. My boss always yells, doesn't matter who, there is always a reason for him. I made my way there and asked as politely as possible if I may join him. He looked upset, more than the usual, looked at me with a red face throbbing in anger, didn't say anything. Well, he did not say no, I took my chance and sat down. The waiter came and I asked him what he can bring me now, without waiting. He replied 'the special soup'. So be it, soup it is. I noticed that boss had not touched his soup, the same one I ordered and it is just sitting there. Looked at my watch and 6 minutes had already passed. Asked him if he was going to have that soup, I ordered the same and he could have mine which would arrive hot. Thought to my self the he must be aware of the meeting I'm presenting in. Well, here goes, I pulled bowl towards me again with as much politeness as I could manage. Amazingly my bosses expression remained absolutely unchanged. I started gobbling down the soup like there is no tomorrow. And as I reached the bottom of the bowl I could notice something there. Heck what ever, I kept at it and finally when I finished it all I could see that the object at the bottom of the bowl was a dead cockroach. Dear goodness, my stomach churned and almost in a single reflex all of what I just swallowed I puked back out onto the bowl drop for drop. As I was reeling from it and began to process the information of what just happened, my boss spoke. "That's right, I did exactly the same!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is more common than you think. Though mostly in case of parents it goes under the radar since a child grows up with the perception that this is the norm. It is subjective to where you are and what help is available there. But seeking out help is your immediate choice. Get support, reach out to friends and family. As you mention 'unstable', seeing that you are reaching out may cause them to erupt in anger. Be prepared, but do not provoke. Should you feel any bit necessary, ring emergency number. It is important that you speak to a professional in about this matter. I am not a professional in health care or as such, nor many other people in this forum. While we can offer words, its best that you seek advise from appropriate professional. Be it doctor, councilor, therapist or even police has specialists in many places who can be of help to you. Depending on your personal circumstance there may be specific organisations in your area that you can reach out to. For now, try and maintain as clear and calm mind as you can. And focus on reaching out and setting up your network of support. Difficult as it may be maintain your focus. In the end things will be alright. Take care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I would recommend you rethink your case choice. For video editing you want something as silent as possible. I'm guessing you will have a mic near by. The more sensitive your mic the more hum/bg noise it will pick up. Silicon footing is also good to eliminate noise. Also you will benefit from something like Samsung 950 Pro Series 256GB M.2 SSD instead, much faster at comparable price.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fractal Design R5 is worthy of notice. A tad more pricey but for your purpose appropriate. If you need to adjust the components, I'd say instead of the GTX970, settle for a step lower and use that fund elsewhere. I render my videos using an old 7950. And investing on CPU instead. Good CPU and motherboard is essential, and quality of RAM which in your case should be fine. CPU cooler need not be Noctua, something like Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo will suffice, provided you do not overclock. While you are at it, place fan on every position of the case which some low RPM fans. Corsair makes some decent ones at ok price point. Idea is to run more fans at lower RPM. That is quiet down the system but cumulative airflow will add up to the right amount. The motherboard's utility will allow you to set RPM of various fans to the right airflow to noise balance. Personally I use fan controller, with good old fashion turning knobs. Keeps it simple, and tune the case for the right noise level and leave it like that. Every time you start your computer till the end of time, the rpm controllers will spin the fans at the same rate (until they go kaput that is).. Its good fun mate, making a system for video editing. Made mine about three years ago. Time to update mine now I suppose. lol.. I'll be putting some videos online soon on my channel regarding systems, hope to see you there. Cheers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In a nutshell, its printing money like there is no tomorrow (VERY LITERALLY). So what is the problem with that you ask. Well, imagine if there is a country where there is $1000 in circulation. And that government has $1000 worth of gold in its vault. So if a person has $1 in his pocket in essence he is carrying $1 worth of gold in value. Now the government goes and prints another $1000 worth of notes. Without adding any more gold to the vault. The man still has $1 in his pocket but the value of that note is 50c in gold. He just got robbed of 50% of this earned money, and the poor person knows it not. Did I mention scam?

    <TEXT>Although not featured in the video, I have checked the M10+ as a webcam. When you connect via USB, automatically the camera presents a short menu, PC Cam, Storage, etc. Simple. It works but limited quality, possibly need better drivers. Windows 10 picked up automatically. Tested with SKYPE. But yes in short, it works. I also tested the SJ5000+, which does not present the PC Cam option. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well simple thing is matter of statistical distribution of colour in retail space. What sells more by numbers gets bigger shelf presence. Walking past the ladies section in any department store, even if you catch a glance you will notice a variety of colours. Never counted, but pink was not the most pronounced colour there. If anything light brown takes up most retail space, indicating most sales of that tone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU with Deadpool</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-20 07:22:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today at work it turned out that I got leave work early, by full 2 hours. YES, the news was as good as it sounded. So I thought about what should I do with this time. First thing came to mind is that I can go watch Deadpool and the cinema was practically about 100 meters away from where I work. To tell you about my excitement, I have not been to a movie that is not Animated (pixar, and dreamworks, etc) since my daughter was born. Which was 8 years ago. Sure I could go to a movie alone or with friends, but it just didn't happen. Twist of luck I suppose. And as I was wrapping up work I looked up the times, there was one showing 1245. I could make it out of work by 1230, that would leave just about enough time to make it. But as it happens there is always one more thing to do. And by the time I left it was 1245. No problems, at the start they have advertisements any way, and a bit from the start missed is no big deal. Walking as fast as I could I took out my phone and started to book a ticked online. So by the time I reached the movies, I had the e-Ticket and went straight to the express checkout and grabbed my printed ticked. As I went towards the cinema room, the attendant who stands at the checkout pointed me towards the Cinema 1, down the hall to the left. Which I did almost running. Went in and the movie was on. Oh boy Oh boy. violence and shooting, explosions, the movie experience I'm gonna savor. Here is how I TIFU - the ticket that I bought online I selected the time 1:45pm instead of 1245. Must have clicked it when walking like crazy. The attendant pointed me to the right cinema room, but did not check time. So I walked into the room where the movie was already playing and was near the end. (Dont wat to spoil by telling up to where but just before the finale). I thinking this movie is awesome with all the action scenes, until the credit started rolling I realized that this is not the beginning its the end and the fact that TIFU TLDR - TIFU by walking into the wrong cinema room and ended up watching the end of the movie. So now I know how it all ends. But haven't seen the whole movie.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>64:27 not 21:9 - There has to be a reason other than marketing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-26 01:34:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am not sure why 21:9 is on the title graphics, there must be a reason. So far as I know it originated from a marketing move by Phillips. Many manufacturer jumped on the band wagon. I was discussing this in one of my recent video of a ultra wide monitor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSCAkVCXu9g 4/3 was the traditional format. Then the widescreen came which was two 4/3 monitors side by side. If we multiply 4/3 x 4/3 we have our 16/9. To go ultra wide we place another 4/3 to the side. Hence 16/9 x 4/3 = 64/27. 21/9 is basically 7/3 but no one calls it that, because in marketing it does not sound so BIG. I suppose mass consumer does not care about correct representation, but I believe a select group who is enthusiastic about the format will, hence this post. Best wishes.</TEXT>

And I do like the notion of old lasting things. Like some of the old tools I got. They don't fail me, and I don't loose or replace them. The logo, that is what got me thinking. The product is such, where the branding could be plain, yet we will look right past it and admire the bigger picture. Perhaps, this is not spoken with the right words. Just was a notion for a moment of thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While each concentric level were in theory growing by 185mm, due to various reasons they were not perfect to the mm, some were longer others shorter and some just happened to be just right. So almost each one of these pieces had been to the drop saw twice till we reached the edge of the deck, since over hang was trimmed by a track saw. For those outer pieces, as long as they were long enough it was good. Its the inner circles that took most amount of time and work. Tools needed were nothing special, a drill, impact screw driver, drop saw, track saw. Other items like clamps, string lines, spirit levels, patience and so forth were handy. Total cost was approximately about AUD5000. This roughly also includes the carpenter's cost however he was hired for a bigger task of renovating the entire house, so not clear on how to split that cost. There is also some electrical work for lights again a full fee for the entire renovation. Going by the dates the pictures were taken on. The picture with bare joists were taken on April 28, and last picture before I started oiling the deck was July 29. It seems like I had been there only a fortnight, but 3 months.. wow.. mind you, I was doing lots of other things at the same time. Bringing supplies, coordinating trades, doing work on other parts of the house and my day job as well .. lol.. If I had prior experience of doing this and had the opportunity of working with 100% focus, it may have taken lot less time. Thanks for asking the question, it made me look closely at the pictures and remembered the other things happening at the background, like the garage and the concrete a fence and all that. Busy times...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Awesome reply. To tell you frankly, your criticism is possibly the best I have received. YouTube's comment section in general is not as articulate (quite the opposite I'm afraid). Hence there is this appeal about Reddit communities, where there are pockets of people who care about their subject matter. I mentioned the term 'one size fits all' a few times in the video, though the video itself is indeed one measure applied to all, why duly deserves its criticism. A 12 minute long video, that involves personal assessment on subjects, is bound to divide opinions. As was the case with the previous video I made about Samsung Earbuds. The same can be expected again, if not with more intensity. You are on point about bringing default earphones to a community of audiophiles. While that is in its place, every audiophile I bet has a smartphone. Which means they received an earphone with it (with some exceptions). The objective here was to bring attention to the item that we receive, after all we paid for them (they are improving the chargers because big reviewers started talking about them). I am making the argument that the manufacturers have the resources to design better, and not necessarily raise the cost enough to matter. With humility I accept my shortcomings in presentation. The overall subject is bigger, and a subject that of all communities, r/headphones would acknowledge. Best Regards. P.S - With reference to Samsung, I was of the opinion that they improved the driver over the last model which they shipped with S5 and Tab S, but that in the scheme of things did not matter in the end due to not forming the seal. For me (personally) that is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Restraint in language is something I "have to" do, simply because YouTube crowd often can not stomach harsh criticism. There are lots of hardcore fans that would skip over to the end and hear the conclusion, if it is not to their agreement, the video gets a thumbs down. All the while the process, the assessments are all ignored. Reminds me of the time when I was harsh towards Beats Solo2. With the previous video that I made commenting solely about these Samsung earbuds I received this comment - "they designed for Asian ears or what they fit my ears perfectly and my friends don't have a problem with it either". I KID YOU NOT. Asian ears, how do I possibly respond to a comment like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me frame it a bit differently. When I restrain my language, I still get across the notion. Also, the idea that kids take their pills in ice cream sort of thought. If anything, some of my regular followers watches my videos because I'm often more harsh than the peers when it comes to criticism. One example is the SJ6 review I did recently. If you check out the Pros and Cons section (11:15). The last point was specifically dramatic, and I did receive an email from the manufacturer's rep on the defensive about that specific point. But yes, there is something here to acknowledge. Balance is between popularity and negative commentary where due. Most choose the path of popularity because that is the oxygen for the channel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, the sliding door we ordered from an aluminum door shop. There are heaps around, they sell windows and doors. Depending on where you are they may go by different names, this one is a stacker. It has three panels, one fixed and two sliding. We originally thought about getting a bifold, that way the opening would be larger. Issue is that bifolds are at least 3 to 4 times the cost, and to add fly screen on that would cost same as the whole thing costs. Plus the installation is more too. With regards to details, I'm happy to share, though which info would you like to know. Regards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Counter top space indeed more is better. We could have added more counter by changing the layout to a U. But that would take away the openness. Storage however there was a fair quantity. You see, the tall cabinet has 4 doors and are about 7ft tall. There is storage above and below the oven. And under all of the counter top space (minus dishwasher), which is three rows in total and they are deeper than what over head cabinets are. It may not look it at first, but there is ample storage space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you notice in the video when I was panning from indoor to outdoor, the tracks show. With regards to the width of each pane, they are about the same width as any sliding aluminum door, just a bit heavier since they are bigger than most sliding door panes. With the it all closed this is how it looks: http://imgur.com/a/idrdF The fly screen can be at the right most, where it usually stays. They are two panes that stack as well. Meaning then the sliding doors are completely open, the two panes of flyscreen will stack like - Glass + screen + screen. In this picture the two panes of the flyscreen is at the middle, for no real reason. About tricks of installation, couldn't offer you any since it was all done by professionals. My recommendation would be to add roller blinds as opposed to vertical blinds. If you notice the blinds are at the top neatly rolled away. Other kinds of blinds, usually will hang some where and be more visible than the clean look we are after. Pros and cons, well, one that comes to mind, is don't get your finger crushed when closing. Other is, the wider stacking door you want, the more the installation will cost. Since majority of cases you will need a beam above it. Bigger the beam the more they cost. Pros, well, its cheaper than bifold yet provides almost the same effect of the indoor outdoor feel. Its most certainly easier to open and close than a bifold, just unlock and slide, where as bifolds have locks on every hinge which is a lot of pain to open and close every time. Hope this helps.. Cheers..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, we did consider kaboodle and also the Good Guys. Went and got quotes from both. I buy a lot of things off the good guys, but kitchen will not be one of them. They can't compete and what put me off was the consultant kept talking down IKEA and laughed off Bunnings as if its a dollar shop. They would not give me a copy of the specs, so when she was not looking I took a picture, and infact the cabinets and backing boards were inferior, after all that talk. Anyhow. Kaboodle came close, and has some good things about them too. Like (cant confirm) the backing boards are the same thickness as the side walls (as per my handy man). Ikea won by a country mile at the time (because of a special then). As we were Ikea Family member. Got a voucher for about $1000 for buying the kitchen from them. This came in super handy as all of that was used to buy items for the bathroom reno. The quality is brilliant, has like a ridiculous 20 plus year warranty of some kind. The soft closes and drawers etc worked like a charm. Price was very reasonable. Win win. But also, there was a piece missing, we called up, they sent it via mail, came in like 5 days or so. They knew what we were talking about, all items have a code and we thought we wanted to add some more accessory, there is a massive range, more than the other two put together then multiplied by two. Bottom line, The Good guys did not gain our confidence. Bunnings - While we did not go with them for kitchen, we got a whole lot of other items from the place for other parts of the reno, they do carry a lot of other items at competitive price. Like the deck we did for example, entire thing came from the shelves of Bunnings (bar the breakfast bar) Ikea - unless you want something very specific, and you know exactly what it is you want go with Ikea. They are like the Toyota of Kitchen. I know there are the Bugattis and Masarattis of Kitchen suppliers out there. And in that segment of the market, people get the highend stuffs as they can pay for it cause the house is worth justifying a 60k kitchen. These are my opinions from personal experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The question that needs asking is how important is 4K to you. Up to QHD there are very nice options, with EIS. My personal favorite is the SJ6 from SJCAM, well built all rounder that has a Gyro setting of 'High' and that is one of the most aggressive stabilization that I have come across. But has fake 4K. The story is similar in general. You get what you pay for, may as well aim towards what will really be useful.</TEXT>

Surely you would make a channel Teaser aiming for viewers to expect something in the future, a reason to subscribe. I could not tell from just looking from the video, what your niche is. Is it about what you do in your daily life, or is it automotive, or general adventure type stuff? Kinda unanswered there. Seeing how you edited the video, you have skills mate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lighting issue is something that most YouTubers face in the early days. An expensive camera is not needed, nor elaborate setup. Most household things like table lamp, or floor standing lamp, etc can fill the room with light. The more light there is the lower ISO setting the camera can afford. Your sound quality is acceptable, though at times it peaked. That if possible is to be avoided. The best thing I like about your video is you ma man. Charisma is hard to come by. By looking at your video, as a viewer I can easily get a sense that you have the intent to entertain. That right there is your secret sauce, please carry it forward into your future videos. Technical things can be sorted, essence is a subject at a whole another level.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I normally talk about consumer electronics, reviews and such. Often state specs, or measurements or some kind of reasoning before passing an opinion. self review: In the following video I took 5 earphones from some of the big name manufacturers and pinned them against each other. Made all attempt to keep things as objective as possible. Before stating my opinion gave elaborate reason why. Issue, is that it appears that the comment section appears to be filled with fans of the brand getting angry at me. Or saying things like "I vote for". Nothing to do with vote, its a comparison with the hope that manufacturers would lift their game. It does not appear to me that I got the message across, and the whole spirit in which this video was made is faded in the background somewhere. Your thoughts, cheers..

    <TEXT>Not hard to follow. I would not word it like that. If you think about it, its a good amount of material cramped into smaller time space. While the live shows have extremely different pace. I do not intend to put it in bad light either, the promises this video made, I WANT YOU TO FULFILL them. I want to see the answers to these problems. You have it in this video to entice subscribers. Its harder to critique the video as mostly you are using videoscribe as well, so there is not much in the way of filming errors to correct either. Perhaps the speed of animation takes part of the attention making the video speed appear faster. But most, I think who frequents YouTube would be close to half my age. For them perhaps its all ok. My channel is not big by any means, but if you would like to do collab at some stage, I welcome it. All the best mate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To review something like this. Well, to begin, the graphics is nice, and has good motion throughout. The music is the best part of the video, its really high quality. If you have made it yourself, fantastic job, or if you commissioned it to be made, must have costed you a pretty penny. I can imagine kids watching these everyday. If all the contents of your channel are similar, which appears to be so from the surface, you certainly will get a good following soon. I don't think you need critique to improve your videos. I cannot, and most who will see this post I would venture to say could surpass the quality of your video (or I may stand corrected). Thus, I doubt you will receive any improvement tips here. What I do believe you need is a SEO/SEM budget. You got the product, promote it. Once the ranking rises, you will have your money back and then some.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some technical tips, when you zoom in on your foreground, zoom in your bg in proportion as well. Else the fact that there is a greenscreen in use is too obvious. The idea is to hide that fact. Next is, when you zoom in, you are doing it in post. Which lowers the quality then and there. Rather, use your lens to take close up shots. Let the work be done while filming, not while editing. You could get away with it if you were filming at much higher resolution and there is enough pixels to crop in and not loose on sharpness. As far as content goes, I feel that it needs a bit more compression, more punchlines, and quicker. Humor is a hard thing to do, and by most part you got your style and direction right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When not making Consumer Electronic Review videos, at times I make videos of more general nature. This particular one came to mind then I thought about how we used to play games when younger. Things were different back then. I suppose the same applies to the future as well. The video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6HO7j7Uzo self review: This video's main technical fault is that there are not too many hi-def content to make a HD video. Like in the middle when I could film the graphics card, that is filmed in Full HD, rest is not possible since, in the retro sense, they were optimised for displays that were around 1024x768 or less in 4:3 aspect. My attempt on humor is also some what not at a pro level, wish I had more practice of such. Most videos that I do are serious, with facts and figures. Making a gaming video is not my forte, hence I seek some advise on how to improve on such genre.

When in the park, there were places that it was overwhelming, depending on which direction the wind blew. And there were wet areas steaming, and the sun beating down. The experience makes it easy to imagine what nature could do to us if it were to get angry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your lighting was in general decent. Though it appeared that in some scenes the light may have been too close to the subject. Almost peaked. If there is something to be improved that would be the shadows. Your individual character shots are good, group is where I believe some tweaking could be done. One persons shadow on another is difficult to avoid. If I may say, the end bit should have been in another video. Bloopers or making of - kind of content should not be in the same video. What it did was that if one was following the story, it immediately unpacks the peak, which this video did build. You have good skills as far as storyboard goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the first giveaway video I ever did. There were are still a lot of questions I have in mind about doing a giveaway. Biggest being doubt of its benefits. Anyhow, moving forward. Self Review: As far as self criticism goes, I think I may not have explained what needs doing clearly. Perhaps I should have mentioned the model numbers in the video using text. I have a feeling that the video may be going too fast. Usually my videos take its time, but they are mostly reviews, so very different in nature. If I do this again in the future, how can I get better effect.

    <TEXT>Thought people would google the back story. The story begins about 20 years ago. There was a fish and chips shop that used to feed the scraps of fish to the pelicans. As years go by, things change, and in this case for the better. The local council made the pavilion from where they do the feeding. Today many volunteer for the feeding activity. And also while the birds gather, they are helped (health and conservation) in case if they have anything stuck on them like fishing hooks, etc. Personally I have been there a few times, first time about 12 years ago, when there were shops and the paved area, but not much else. This place is a proper tourist attraction today, and generally has the atmosphere of an open carnival or festival. People go there to enjoy the afternoon. Who would have thought all this would come out of feeding some pelican scraps of fish as opposed to throwing it in the bin.

    <TEXT>This was playing at the back of my mind at the time of posting. Though, the reference here is that this was shot using the new Samsung product, secondly wide angle lens is an advantage that the S10 series has, which is some what less adapted at this time, but here forth, is set to be the norm. Because we can take shots like this, which without a wide lens is not possible. Fair critique of the photo itself is justified on the other hands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, Overall I think you are on the right track. I'm not a subject matter expert on gaming, so will confine my words to technical things as much as possible. Some feedback that I can offer is as you have pointed out is narration. This is a difficult thing to get right. Speaking in a constant volume is something that needs practice and is not something that we do in day to day life, but for recording its important. Then when we do a peak of -3 to -4 dB. (Not normalise, very important). Then the music usually for me between -18 to -21dB has been reasonable mix. But test it out to find your best balance. Second thing and this is just my personal opinion and take it with a pinch of salt. As I was watching the video, it felt at times, you are speaking too fast for me to keep up. But I am the kind of person who regularly gets blamed for speaking too slowly. As far as visuals go, you are up there with top channels. Rythm, balance, style will come by the year two. Technically if I may share something is there was a blank black screen in the middle, if possible avoid 'no content' sections, it is a prompt for viewers to click away. Remember there is unlimited content out there (for one lifetime). Idea is to maintain attention. You used some overlay graphics to break up on going recorded gameplay, increase that, or keep some kind of overlay to show that this is not just a screen capture, but ties to the narration in some manner.  #8203; Don't know what production experience you have, but if you are starting from scratch and are self taught, you are a rough dimond waiting to shine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, You seem to have a depth of knowledge on the subject. Sadly apart from your name I did not know anything about you. By that I mean credentials. Are you a registered accountant, or have a BBA or anything for that matter? The reason for saying so is from the get go you had my attention, but even a doctor in his own clinic introduces himself. This could be near the intro or at close. But remember when I need legal advise I always talk to my lawyer, for health care there is doctor, computer science with Software Engineers, for gossips I have friends. While you are at it, separate yourself from gossip and be the pro, it would take minimal effort for much better retention/subscription. The plain background is a decent way to go, many big channel creators keep things simple like that. Though the switch at the bottom left was just there. Casual is fine, but I think a shirt would have resonated better, you are presenting business ideas to would be business owners. Others have pointed out about the mic, a simple lapel mic is best suited for your application. Also, when presenting text perhaps 1/3 or 1/1 left right split. Text on top of your face was probably best managed differently. These things will polish up nicely, your content is good, as such it sould pick up traction if you keep at it. All the best.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A kids channel with my daughter [Review Video]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-22 06:38:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, Recently me and my daughter, we thought why not make a channel for kids. Kind of a Educational / Entertaining channel. So the idea is to present things that are scientifically accurate, but will be simple enough for children to follow. One of the challenge remains things like disclaimers or side notes. Example, saying that hippo milk is pink is not in its entirity accurate, so a sub note had to be presented, but its not entirely ideal how it was done. Have to work around that somehow, as such situations are bound to present again. In furure I also intend to include references to content as much as possible, as I am a believer of credibility.  #8203; *self review:* There are a list of things that we are working on to improve the overall visual presentation and entertaintment factor. Animation being one of the biggest issue to tackle. As soon as we see virtual characters we want to see tham talk and move arms about. But that is a challenge at this stage. Things that we are working to improve is: \- The story format \- The scene setup \- Charecter lip movement (whole body animation as well) \- developing more humorous note \- Channel graphics overall Would appreciate your feedback on how to be more engaging and things I most certainly have missed. The video in question: [https://youtu.be/WDggZR1dh18](https://youtu.be/WDggZR1dh18) Two reviews from me today: \[Review 1\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/beplny/review\_video\_new\_video\_game\_series\_concept/elh7g8o?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/beplny/review_video_new_video_game_series_concept/elh7g8o?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x)) \[Review 2\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/bchtio/review\_video\_start\_business\_in\_3\_hours\_4min\_video/elh8q8q?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/bchtio/review_video_start_business_in_3_hours_4min_video/elh8q8q?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, Your words are very polite. BTW, where in reddit can I hire such artist. We do not really have any budget, this was just a fun thing me and the kids put together. In the process my daughter learnt about audio recording (my son too) and gimp. Her character and the submarine, and various other things are her work artwork. Plus she wrote the script too (is writing more as well).  #8203; So a good experience for the kids. I'm curious myself of where this goes.  #8203; Regards</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We used Sony vegas for Editing. Almost all graphics has been made in GIMP.  #8203; I am looking into the Adobe suite, but since we do not have any budget for this, the $22 monthly fees appears to be excessive. Also that price is for student. Which my daughter is, but she is too young to make any online purchase (I'll not allow it either).  #8203; But yes, it is something to consider. Lets see how the next video goes, if there is any traction at all, I'll fork out..  #8203; Regards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have made a front boundry wall with Composite decking board. For the purpose it was awesome. We used grey and used stainless steel screws on it, really made it pop. As far as the object itself, the brand we used had consistancy of hardwood. I have worked with softwood like pine, easy to work with, no pre drilling needed, hard wood like this deck needs predrilling. In composite its pre drilling needed plus you will need to replace the bit every now and then, they are that hard (and heavy too). It may or may not be the right product for you, personally next deck I make (personally speaking) I'll use treated pine and will stain it. Its cheaper so will attempt to double the size of the deck instead. Where I'm trying to make a statement, like vertical wall near the enterance or something of that kind, I'll use the composit. Use once and its zero maintenence for life. Costs more than hardwood (here in Australia) so not ideal in all cases, but if you want to try it like, build and forget, no maintenence living, it will work. Share photo when you are done .. :)</TEXT>

The only thing that I may say is when you were introducing your video standing in the room, I could not hear some of the words. Felt a little echoey and low volume. 1 - That which comes to you naturally is great. If you are excited about your subject matter it will come through. 2 - I think its just right. 3 - No, nothing to change there, you are who you are, how you are, and you are welcome on my screen any day.

    <TEXT>Tech reviews, I 've been at it for over 7 years now. Your first video is so much better than what I managed back then. This is a difficult segment to gain popularity in. But I think you have most of the elements right.  #8203; Your english is fine, don't worry too much about it. Only few technical but easy fix I would say would be lighting. Dark is awesome when it works properly, but its hard to get right in a tech video, light everything up. Second thing is, lower the music volume a bit, it drowns out your voice at times.  #8203; Focus was also on background as opposed to the mouse in some shots. Minor stuff. Normally it takes a few videos to get the feel for the format. You might want to consider a closing scene.  #8203; All the best.</TEXT>

Some overlays to carry the story of the video or contribute to it.  #8203; But most importantly, I think an angle is more important. Is this fun video, sad video, daily life with nothing to see video, what is it, who is it for, why is it there at all?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, Avantree specifically did contact me, most of the 'unknown' brands they contacted me. Some I contacted, like Sjcam or Bluedio. Rest usually are items that I purchased, or were from our own stock. \------------------------------- Don't worry about focus or other technical items, obsessing over those will take too much time, and may demotivate you. There was a time when I laboured over my shots like fanatic, (SJCAM M20, SJ7, SJ8 are good examples). But you have to balance time and effort. Those videos I mentioned, took enough time that I could make 3 videos (becasue of on location shots, travel times, etc). If you are aiming towards a cinamatic movie like videos you will need lot of time, on the other hands, if you are keep things simple, production time can be reduced greatly, but there are a lot of similar channels with easy production strategy. Currently rising above the crowd is important for success.  #8203; 7 years ago I could post an absolute rotten banana of a video, and it would gather 5 digit hits, when I had no followers. Those days are long gone.  #8203; Outdoor shots are rare in tech review community, and its refreshing to see. Diffused sunlight will be your friend. Trust me, for tech reviews, nature has given us a gift that artificial lighting can not match. Start having fun, make jokes, things like that. Originally I had to be all official like, since my business name was attached to the channel (still is), and there were stakeholders. You have this freedom that I didn't, make good of it.  #8203; All the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all your voice is well recorded. The editing is good too, I would imagine that with content like this getting rid of excess footage is a talent of its own.  #8203; I am not a gamer (not for a decade at least), so I should not bring my personal taste in this, but it is my opinion that if you were to appear on the video in one of the corner that would increase the appeal much. If you were to appear full screen for lets say a 20 second monologue, that would be awesome too. This is more so to connect with the audience. But again, this may go against your style. Overall I think the content is good, for two reasons, your voice is easy to follow, and that brings me to the second point that is the words are nicely related to the content of the screen.  #8203; Good job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The time lapse is a good touch but 8 seconds before anything else happens is tad a bit long. The first few seconds we are trying to establish a context, it was clouds and a ramp. I like how it looks but it could have probably served much better as a outtro. Overall the video is doing the right things technically speaking. The lights are reasonable, the motion jerkiness is managed well. The music certainly is not to everyone's taste, but I dig it and how it relates to the content. Perhaps lower the level.  #8203; One of the biggest no no is swearing. If left unchecked on the channel without censoring may land you into issues later on. Just add a beep.  #8203; You are on the right direction. All the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no comments about the subject matter as it is different for every channel. Technically there are things that can be done to improve rather quickly. I take it that you will be narrating like this for most of your videos. The video was taken in a single shot, props to your speaking skills. If you use an editor you can add more contents on the video as the story progresses. For example, the kind of green person you were describing, the internet is full of such graphics. Next thing is the focus, though there is Full HD available, it did not improve on the quality of the video. Probably your camera was out of focus. Turn on the light, any camera needs light, lots of it, this is a constant challenge for any one with camera (for video or otherwise). Various YouTubers have different ways of employing light to make the signature style. Like with any starting channel, you will need to things like intro and outtro. Also branding stuffs for your channel will help. All the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your content is interesting as hell. I saw the coin from thin air and learnt a new trick :D As far as your channel has the general issues that any new starter faces and what I mean by that are as follows: \- Lighting issues at times \- Dedicated mic would help \- A location setup But these things comes as you progress. You yourself, you are the talent here, plus you explain things clearly. My friend, every successful YouTuber are good at making videos. Self taught, short film makers essentially. Hence my genuine advise is that you need one more talent and that is film making. Not just one thing, not just filming video, nor just audio, its everything, every chapter of the entire book. Please, I do not intend to sound harsh. If your film making is brushed and polished, mate you will go mainstream in no time. I saw a few videos from your channel, and I kept thinking that it is you who is the talent, but a jewel fits best on a crown. Likewise, your talent will showcase best in higher quality productions.  #8203; Take care, and keep at it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Channel Critique] Channel about Properties, Renovations, Development you name it - Need some direction</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-21 11:39:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi Everyone, So recently I started a channel about properties. I intend to share my knowledge that I learnt over the years. Also, I'll keep updating the viewers of what is happening with my current projects, every step as they happen. So, in the long run one can have enough information from my channel that covers a project from start to finish.  #8203; [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVn1YLnDzGD0c2usoSssORg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVn1YLnDzGD0c2usoSssORg)  #8203; This is my second channel, I mostly used to make tech review videos on the main channel.  #8203; I have at the moment only two videos there, as far as projects go. The question is what directions to take. Should I go all serious, or joke down to clownish. I need to know about the balance. self review: I have been having some issues with the green screen which caused some jagged edge. I'll be fixing that up. Also the colour tone does not appear correct. As far as content goes, I also have tendency to freeze infront of the camera, no matter how well I can talk on my own, rolling camera makes me stutter, and that seems to be hardest to break out of.  #8203; Looking forward to your feedback.  #8203; Todays reviews: [https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfwymb/review\_video\_rainbow\_six\_siege\_video/eud7qsn?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfwymb/review_video_rainbow_six_siege_video/eud7qsn?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x)  #8203; [https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfpgub/review\_video\_summer\_skate\_video/eud81gk?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfpgub/review_video_summer_skate_video/eud81gk?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x)  #8203; [https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfripg/review\_video\_how\_i\_got\_to\_area\_51/eud8n7q?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfripg/review_video_how_i_got_to_area_51/eud8n7q?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x)  #8203; [https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfuk8g/channel\_critique\_wanting\_to\_grow\_my\_magic\_channel/eud97t2?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/cfuk8g/channel_critique_wanting_to_grow_my_magic_channel/eud97t2?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x)  #8203; One more for good measure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Incredible comment. Lots to think about. Your point about who my audience is, is indeed a potent question. I have not clearly figured that out myself. All I was thinking was that there are two projects that are going to unfold and I'll start giving updates as we go with some info on the process. Eg, the next few videos will be updates about demolitions, so things about asbestos removal, what the demolition company is supposed to do for you and what happens next and so forth. Thus if we follow each project from start to finish, a subscriber would know the process end to end, and perhaps be benefited by it.  #8203; The fact that you raised some question like who the council is and what the process is, is another crucial subject. While a builder does most of the building work an individual may have to interact with the council, and they can be very strict without any room for wiggle.  #8203; By the way, if I'm not asking for too much, this morning I uploaded another video, with slightly changed format. No green screen: [https://youtu.be/8iVFiGmvgz8](https://youtu.be/8iVFiGmvgz8) It would be great to hear your thoughts on this one.  #8203; BTW, the branding was done in a rush late at night. I'll be certain to revisit it soon.  #8203; Thanks again, you have indeed shone light on my path.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You want 100% honestly, well here goes. I've been doing tech review for over 9 years now and let me tell you, this segment of youTube is filled to the brim. So, if you really want to make it, if you really are not wasting yours and other's time, BE SERIOUS. That is my very first reaction, I'll touch upon technical things in a moment, if you do not take yourself seriously, your audience will most certainly not either. Next is camera, low res can be forgiven, you have to start somewhere, but shaking the camera, and dropping it at one point, how is that acceptable. You made the video in one take, if it was bad the first time, you should have done it again, and done it better. If you burn the food you cooked badly, will you serve it to your guest? Technical things are things that gets better over time, you will get the lighting right, and with that the focus may sharpen, try a tripod, etc etc. Other things are harder to improve on, like scripting, making a video with several shots and then editing them into one video project. For a reviewer, narration is incredibly important, its a skill that will take time to adopt. Most importantly, and I can not stress this enough, I know you are young and all but if you really want to get into the big league: Be serious about about it. You want us to be impressed, well intend it, make an effort to impress us. Like I said earlier, there are loads of tech reviewers out there, I come across new ones too. You can make it too, you really can. Technical things, you will overcome those too. What I am questioning is weather you want to.. do you really want to?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-31 11:49:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So previously I asked feedback about my channel and got some feedback. Made some changes to the way I made the newer video, and to tune my videos further, I'm turning to the good folks of Reddit again. What would catch your attention: Self review: This particular video in question runs over 10 minutes. I know at times I talk slowly, which could have saved me at least a minute. But there is also a feeling I have that I have not covered a whole lot of content. If this was a chapter in a book I was writing there would have been much more detail. But I'm afraid that there would not be viewer retention. I am also troubled by the thought of being click baity, I see a whole lot of people who have done well in YouTube but they use misleading title or thumbnail, or practically get on their knees for likes, I absolutely do not want to do that. But it also seems therefore the efforts will go to waste. Where is the balance at? Also, building a Duplex is at a minimum over a year long process, with lots of intricate details, I'd like to share all of the knowledge, everything that I know, but it appears I have only shown the tip of the ice berg. That in itself is a criticism I think. Let me know your thoughts, I'll try to morph to accommodate.

I have been meaning to get a new one, so after work dropped by the local camera shop and got one today. Had you not mentioned I probably would have put it off longer.... lol.. * Joke, that is an artform I'm no master of, but I'll give it a good ol crack.. * Last point, small topics, at a time, to put it to practice I may as well do a video on Easement. Perhaps that video should be dedicated to you :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took this photo from work, which is 20 stories high and this car was about a kilometer away. This is as far as my phone could zoom in. Now, the big question is, what is this car, why is it being pushed by a barge, and the floating platform really looks unsafe if there are big waves, what is the significance of this. The location is Darling Harbor, Sydney. Various shows takes place there, but no car show that I am aware of, plus there are plenty of roads to get there. Plus there are safer more convenient drive on drive off transportation available. I have never seen a car transported like this.  #8203; Any clues?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fire did exist, in fact the aboriginal people used to light fire before moving away from one place to another. In modern days there is back burning. These are controlled planned actions. But this activity was changed by management. Secondly, Australia is a solar rich county, but coal is big business. We voters can only do so much as much as big businesses can place people in places. Recently Australian democracy was down graded from open to narrowed. Neither party will save the planet, it's all lip service at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a huge drawback.. and that is difficulty.. as far as physical process goes there isn't much to it. In fact nuclear fusion has been performed in labs, no issues there. Just that non of those experiments were net energy positive. What ITER is aiming for is a sustained reaction where energy required to keep the system in its entirety to keep running is less than the yield. And thus we would have the surplus energy for use. There is a different debate here to consider. I believe the current cost estimate for ITER is $20b. Possibly it will be much higher, (please check). For that amount of money other more viable R amp;D could be done on lets say battery tech and cost reduction in the manufacturing process of solar panels, etc. What I'm saying is, we have some money in hand, lets say, why not do the development of more readily achievable tech. That can be applied now, as opposed to a tech that would be ready in 20 years if even that. The crisis of climate is NOW, in 20 years we are much further along on our way to getting stuffed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If we go far back enough, CPUs were set in different ways. For example, lie a permanently soldered chip (I believe the term is surface mounting). Issue with this is that it is then one motherboard, one chip, not much in terms of modularity. Then they were using cpu on cards that would go into slots, for example Pentium 2. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot\_1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_1)  #8203; But those were still limited in terms of bandwidth. And different variations of sockets are still prevalent because of architecture (partly). The pin numbering and its functions and building a design around, is probably simpler for the engineers to work with. On the otherhands having pins is not detrimental for the 99.99% of user. It is only an issue for those very frequently swapping cpus. And even then if done with due caution, its a non issue. As far as breaking things go, there is nothing that can not be broken, and this I can say so from experience. Back in the days, we used to get requests for returns for broken items that would leave us scratching our head, how did this guy manage to break this. Yes, physical damage, and no matter how idiot proof they make a product, there is an idiot out there who will break it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi my name is Adil. Not so long ago, I thought why not share my experiences from years of Property flipping. Buying, Selling, Renovating, New Builds, paper shuffle, and so on, I have done majority of it. When I started if I had someone to guide me, it certainly would have helped, both to save time and to make more money. Hence, the channel. Sooner or later people would like to buy their first home, or build one, or go to an auction and such. If any thing that I know, would help someone else get better result, I'm all for it. I'll keep the technical videos aside for now, here is one I made where I discuss the fun or enjoyable aspects of property flipping: [https://youtu.be/zmSmZXnUD8c](https://youtu.be/zmSmZXnUD8c) Hope you like it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well hello there. Glad to see you and thank you for visiting my channel. With regards to properties, one of the reason why I wanted to make this channel was that I felt there is a gap between regular buyers and professionals of the industry such as agents and builders, etc. I have seen first hand people getting much poorer deal than what was possible at the time. And buying a house is such a massive commitment, it will take years to overcome one bad deal. But at the same time, a good deal can set up a young family many years ahead financially. There is an ocean of knowledge out there, and if I can bring even a little bit to people and make a difference then this effort is worth it. Take care.</TEXT>

This is law speak for as is. Also, if you bite the bullet and got for auction strategy, then accept an offer prior to auction, its sold under 'auction conditions'.

    <TEXT>Having worked in the telephony system of Telstra. There are a number of things I saw that were designed/made rather well. A lot of the exchange was developed by Ericsson (AXE), and Alcatel (System12) to some extent. The software base were reasonable for the purpose, TELEPHONE. The issue is the physical layer, it was old and falling apart. With upper management playing ball game as to who will foot the bill for upgrading it. But now no one cares about making a telephone call, there is no money in it. 20c to make a call? This is not a thing in this decade. The old has been obsolete long time ago, its the legislation that is keeping it alive (in part). Data is the new game and it is being played like a financial maneuver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting words, but seems you are more angry than informed. Some info, I have worked for the largest AU Telco for about 8 years (did I mention that?) My background is in Software Engineering. Having said that, lets address some of your concerns: \- 60 down was on a Sunday evening and that is pretty good. \- In the best case scenatio we had 233mbps (how did you not see that) \- "Melbourne or Sydney and they haven't even installed 4G" - The coverage map was shown and tests were shown done in an average suburb. Your statement is misleading to put it politely. \- "Fiber pushes petabytes" - Can I get such a connection to my home? What will it cost? \- " 5G is incredibly vulnerable to congestion" - Actually 5G is made to address congestion. For your reading pleasure - [https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1407/1407.5495v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1407/1407.5495v1.pdf) Some info in 5G Contention. \- " 5G towers are absolutely not being rolled out in any useable manner. " - Again refer to the coverage map. \- " Everything about 5G proponents just stinks " - It is a technology, just like any tool in a tool box. We'd be using fiber optic connection if we had one. Only a few people got it, rest is getting FTTC or FTTN. As shown on the video, Telstra already states that they will not sell NBN100 via these connection types.  #8203; Now remains the question of edge of town people. They never had good internet to begin with. They will not have good internet in the near future much less fiber to their premise. The rural areas are getting a version of wireless NBN anyway. Again, CHECK THE MAP. 5G is their best hope, and 5G falls back to 4G if connection under certain circumstances. Still connected. " Dumbest video I've really ever seen" - There are over 10 references in the description. Care to do a quality check, see if the references pan out? Perhaps even separate your personal feelings from objectivity if that is too much to ask for. Unless you were trolling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can tell you this, I have no corporate attachment. Hell, there was a part that I took a swing at the Telstra CEOs. Didnt have to, but it is to some extent related. Telstra dividends are strong reasons why a whole lot of elderly people are holding on to their Telstra Shares. Truth be told the yield is not bad. But to give that dividend they must show profits. When I was working at Telstra, there was a sense of we have the best network, fixing the network .. f that.. The two sentiment is at odds, but there it was. Share holders do not care about technology, so long as twice a year telstra gives out that dividend. The mobile network is good, I am using optus now, and hands down, Telstra 4G has been awesome. Except at a price. Moved to Optus, better price point, not as good. By the way, network contention handling is a major aspect 5G technology. The video can not possibly cover everything its longer than 12 minutes already. The analytics shows the average retention is 4 mins. Holding people's attention is a ball game I'll probably not master in my lifetime. Imagine if the video was 30 mins long.. and I talked more about engineering and network protocol. Signal attenuation in context of logarithmic scale and how that relates to 5G. Lol I'd be popular then. Had to bring in the clowns, had to ...</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I just disagree with your conclusion. For 2 main reasons Alright :) We are having intellectual level disagreement - love it.. Point 1: I did mention in the video that 4G is not bad, and the screenshot showed speed tests 100mbps + 4G was offered as a wireless broadband solution for a long time. But not in any economically viable manner. Case in point - Telstra's Netgear Nighthawk. A pocket wifi over 4G that packed a good punch. Paired with telstra's 4G coverage, it was a sweet option for a lot of people. Often favored by gamers, because their other option was ADSL. Issue was money, not technology as such. they were offering like 60GB for $80 if I remember correctly. Speed was not an issue, result, we would chew through it in matter of days. I got two kids mind you. Secondly I also mentioned that I was using 4G prior to the 5G, for $85 - 500GB and excess is $10 per 10GB. Something that we were stung by a few times. We need more than 500GB. That is where the $70 unlimited makes instant sense. Never mind the connection type, I was happy with the connection that 4G provided in the first place. I was using ADSL before that, to put things in context. From an engineering point of view, 4G if used in mass would suffer from network congestion, 5G is more suited for mass loads, to the point that it is being poised for IOT.  #8203; Point 2: Let me start by saying that if I could get FTTP, I surely would have considered it. Most of us would. But we dont exactly have that choice, with some lucky exceptions. In theory you are correct. Theory that takes ideal scenario. One of the inspiration for the video was from me walking down some road and observing broken concrete phone pits one after the other. To regular people its of no concern, but to us (who worked in the industry) these are cause of pain in the neck. I did mention that its a decaying network. Because these broken pits often fill up with water, and the cables inside goes under. The junctions in many cases are old, PMG era old. Made of aluminum or metal other than copper. Thus oxidation takes place over the years. And so on and so forth. Thus bringing home the point, FTTP, FTTB, sure I'm happy to take them. FTTN or FTTC is using old copper, that even Telstra would not want to sell you NBN 100 though it (others are not yet that forthcoming). See where I'm going with this.. Wireless, is inferior, is it really though? I'll present my case: I have also worked facing customers (yet another story there). By an overwhelming majority, people just want a connection that works, has enough GBs for the family, and will not break the bank. We were selling them ADSL, and even that would not work in many places. Did you know that in places like Bundina there were no more ADSL ports left. Thats Sydney metro area, and that is not an isolated case. We had to say to them, if someone on your street disconnects, then you get to have that port. Ridiculous right. It killed me a little bit to say that, and I'm glad that no one threw a hammer at me. Point being all they wanted was some internet. The reliable kind if possible. I want similar too. At this point in time there is no need for even a guy like me to use 200mbps+ down speed. Yes for uploads, I upload to YouTube from time to time. So, if I had nbn 100/20. Even with 4G I had faster uploads than 20, in 5G its going past 30. And this is not theoretical max, this is tyre on the road. This is happening now, at my computer. Your theory is fair. The counter to what you said is in commercial product and what I am getting in real life. Its one thing to say in such and so cases a hard connection is better, and another thing when I am saying that I am absolutely getting my $70 worth. So will the good people I spoke of, their Netflix will not lag with the 4G/5G connection. I will accept that NBN has lower latency than 4G/5G only if I see test data. It could be, but not by far, and at such, we are splitting hair. We are having this conversation in Reddit. We represent a very small fraction of internet users. Consider the moms and dads and the little kid who is going to watch some crap in YouTube and tell his mom he is doing homework. I am using wireless boradband for some time now. If I was going to be unhappy, I would have been so by now. Rather, it so seems that, 4G and 5G was the rescue I needed. My case is not unique. I'm sure there are whole lot of people, general people who will have the same experience.  #8203; :)  #8203; This is awesome.. I look forward to your rebuttal.</TEXT>

The floor is stained, not painted, bit of a difference there. It may not look it in the video, the grains of the wood could still be seen. The paint in tiles, both inside and outside has been purchased application specific. They have been applied as per the directions, and no they will not come off, as the same had been applied elsewhere. Those paints are going to stay there for good.

    <TEXT>Good points. It seems to me, from your words, that they are making these changes with economic feasibility in mind. Here they just took Tax money. 5G is indeed the last mile solution. But void of any cabling, if you think about it. Drawing one fiber to the tower to feed 1000 customers is a whole lot easier, than pulling 1000 individual lines. Plus from experience of my work I can tell you one thing, and that is connection fault with physical line is a thing. There are multiple departments handling line faults of all different kinds. Any flood or fire, both of which happens here every year, takes out phone lines. Wireless connection is simpler in that sense. For fixed points, if there is coverage, you get to communicate. Then comes the connection quality, which has been improving greatly in the last 10 years. Don't know about Belgium much, but here, due to the kind of geography we have. Physical connection to individual houses, is surely a challenge, and outside of metropolitan is even harder. Everyone lives on big acreages. If the city you are in, is well populated, that may just be the right place for wireless to get good foothold. All the best mate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; it's really just a matter of opinion You have brought on some good points. I made the video with atleast some references to back my claims and some demonstrations too. 5G is made with network contention in mind, I believe I have mentioned this before. When you mention - first iteration of ADSL, that sounds more like near 1999 to 2003 something like that? Tech from then to use a case study, I think we are pushing it a bit. Anyhow, FTTC, are you the only person on that one fiber optic line or perhaps there is multiplexing going on. Sure the fiber optic line can take a lot of data, the bottle neck would be the multiplexer or rather the quality of it. Metaphor: Person 1 - I have a ball in my bag Person 2 - Show me Person 1 - Takes out the ball out of the bag and shows it. Person 2 - You had a ball in your bag.  #8203; Point being. Through the video I have shown times and over of speed tests, on 5G and 4G, in different times of the week, in the evening or past midnight. Max reached was 233mbps, and the lowest was about 60. Upload speeds of 30mbps generally. Not in my opinion, but if you ask me now, I can pull up speed test or your choice and share results. I'd say it would be not all that different from what I had shared in the video. I've shown you mine - can you show me yours lol.. I agree with you about one thing - time will indeed show us something. And I've put it out there, that 5G will Kill NBN, and NBN will cease to exist, it shall be no more, and it shall perish. :)  #8203; BTW, forgot to thank you last time for rewatching the video. A lot of effort goes into making them. Best Regards.</TEXT>
