For example, if you want to use a scatter plot, you can the change the data for both axes by the 'select data' when you right click your graph. Instead of putting the data of the independent variable on the x axis, you will put it on the y axis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let u =  #8730;x and v = (2 #8730;x - 1) f(x) = u/v The function is intended to be solved using quotient rule, but you can manipulate the variable 'v' if you want to solve it using product rule. Since 1/v = v^(-1) then f(x) = u  #215; v^(-1) You can solve the v^(-1) using chain rule the proceed to product rule. You can solve the function using either product rule or quotient rule, but it is more tedious to use a product rule because you will need to use the chain rule before using the product rule itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have this mathematical problem where the value of coordinate of another point and the angle of the line with respect to x axis is not given, only the length of the line is given. I try to solve the problem using distance formula. For example: d = 9 x_1, y_1 = (0, 0) x_2, y_2 = (x_2, y_2) d =  #8730;(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 9 =  #8730;(x_2 - 0)^2 + (y_2 - 0)^2 9 =  #8730;(x_2 )^2 + (y_2)^2 81 = (x_2 )^2 + (y_2)^2 The equation is an equation of a circle. 81 = (x_2 )^2 + (y_2)^2 r^2 = x^2 + y^2 where r = 9 Conversion of polar to rectangular: x = 9cos( #952;) y = 9sin( #952;) cos( #952;) = x/9 sin( #952;) = y/9  #952; = cos^-1 (x/9)  #952; = sin^-1 (y/9) However, I was not able to solve this part because the angle is not given.

    <TEXT>An octahedral molecule has a symmetrical shape and does not have axes and equators since all the angles between atoms are 90 degrees, does it mean that an octahedral molecule have no dipole moment? Thank You.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example, the pi bonding of py and pz orbitals of B2 and C2 have lower energies compare to the sigma bonding of px. On the other hand, the pi bonding of py and pz orbitals of F2 and O2 have greater energies compare to the sigma bonding of px. Does the interaction of 2s orbital and 2p orbital and the electronegativity of an atom affects the energy of a molecular orbital bonding? Thank You.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the hydrogen bonded OH band is a broad peak at 3400 per centimeter to 3300 per centimeter which is totally easy to observe on the infrared spectrum. On the other hand, COH bending appears as a broad and weak peak at 1440 per centimeter to 1220 per centimeter which is often overlapped by the CH3 bending. It is the reason that I am curious on how to determine the COH peaks produced by alcohols and phenols if they are usually overlap by CH3 peaks on the infrared spectrum. Thank You.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In cases where a visual indicator is unavailable, potentiometric indication of the end point can often be used. Potentiometric titrations are among the most accurate known because the potential follows the actual change in activity and, therefore, the end point will often coincide directly with the equivalence point. Potentiometric titrations are straightforward. They involve measurement of an indicating electrode potential against a convenient reference electrode and plotting the change of this potential difference against volume of titrant. The indicating electrode in precipitation titrations is used to follow the change in pM or pA, where M is the cation of the precipitate and A is the anion. A glass pH electrode is used to follow acid-base titrations, silver electrode is used to follow titrations with silver ion, and inert electrode (platinum) is used to follow redox titrations.
