    <TITLE>Do I [21] confront the man [23] I've loved for 4 years, or leave things casual?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-08-11 12:16:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>[I'm sorry this is so long, I've tried but have no idea how to shorten it, it all seems integral to the story, thank you very much if you read it all] The history is slightly complicated. We met in college when I [F] was 16 and he was 18 because I'd heard about him through a mutual friend, her stories about her boy friend and him (we'll call him H) intrigued me and I needed to know more about this boy. I added him on myspace and he replied to one of my bulletins (I posted a cyanide and happiness comic and he read it too! Happy to say this was our first reason for communication, we still read it together to this day) We started hanging out and after about 2 months of smoking weed, watching movies, urbexing, going for long drives, watching him skate, perfecting our zombie apocalypse plans and having eons long thought provoking conversations, we were dating. We dated for a year and half, both our longest and most significant relationship to date. I told him I loved him after another 2 months but he never said it back (he'd never told any girl he loved them). We broke up because he "didn't want a girlfriend anymore" but after a short while he met a girl and started dating her (we'll call her S). We never stopped hanging out, I was well integrated into his friendship group, enough to have these friends as my own, I even made a massive effort with his new girlfriend (who ended up being one of my best friends) but it all got too much for me and with this and multitude of other reasons (been struggling with depression, self-harm, ED and a shitty family since I was 12/13) I tried to kill myself. He was the one who saved me. Anyway, after the news and drama of my little incident died down, we met up because he had to tell me something. Bare in mind he's still with S at the moment. We met up in a field next to the farm he used to live on and he couldn't say what he wanted, he was never good at opening up, something I helped him out with to some extent, so he wrote me a letter instead, the whole time I'm holding his left hand by request. He walked off once he'd finished to let me read it. In short, it told me that he loved me, that he always did love me and he was sorry it took him so long to realize, he was scared of the word because of his parent's relationship, he didn't really know what he was doing with S, although he did like her a lot and thank you for showing him that love was beautiful and not something to fear. He broke up with S and we started sort-of seeing each other again, I was ecstatic, and things were going so well. Me and S were still best friends, even with all the jealousy floating around, we were close enough to talk about it. Then I fucked up. He went on a 3 month trip around America (we're English), where he carved our initials into a tree in Redwood forest and was given a pendant by someone he met to give to me after having talked highly about me, referring to me as his girlfriend. I slept around while he was gone, technically, it wasn't cheating but let's face it, I cheated my ass off. I have no idea why I did it, you can tell me I don't really love H, but I know I do, I never ever stopped. I've racked my brains over and over again to figure out why I did but I've never come up with any sort of reason. The closest I can get is that I'd got so used to telling him I loved him and not having it back that when I did get it back, I was shit scared. I've spent the last 2 and half years punishing myself for what I did, emotionally, physically, mentally, consciously and subconsciously, the pain that I caused him absolutely ruined me. How could I do such a wicked thing to such a beautiful creature? We tried to work it through but he couldn't trust me anymore and it fell apart. He ended up dating S again, for nearly a year, we talked, but not much because S was insecure about it, and I don't really blame her as last time he broke up with her for me. This is where we are now. He's been single for three months now, two months ago he came to my house to hang out and a month ago I came to where he goes to uni and spent a week with him. An incredible week. On the third to last night we cuddled, after about half an hour of beating hearts and silence I turned to him and said "okay, I've got to ask, what the fuck?" We had a fag and talked about it. He said it (with help from me) that it felt comfortable and familiar, but he didn't want anything. We talked about S and he said he still doesn't really know why she broke up with him, and he would have stayed with her, but on the other hand, he was with her because she reminded him of himself five years ago and the months without her had been some of the happiest of his life. Previously, I'd found out that he had told her he loved her first, and that when they broke up he'd told her he loved her and she said "I know" basically, not the way I thought the relationship was going. Anyway, on the last night we ended up having sex, and it was incredible, I mean, they should have filmed that shit. I'd forgotten why I loved sex so much in the first place, we just seemed to go together, you know. I spent a month at home, camping and hitching around Europe, keeping in contact with him. Now, I'm back in the city he goes to uni in, and I've been here for a little over a week, today is my last day. The first night I was here, we slept in my hammock under the stars and, while I was in his arms, he said, sincerely "I've missed you". We've been acting more couple-ly in private and public, with me following his lead, even around his friends. We're planning on meeting up in Europe at the start of September as we both have separate trips planned around the same time, and I know it's going to be a mind blowing experience, hitching and camping in whatever damn city or forest we fancy that night. So, down to my question, finally! Obviously, I'm very insecure about S, I'm worried that I'm being used as a rebound or a substitute, we've not talked about anything of this nature since the first night we cuddled. I don't want to know "where this is going" but I want to know his... intentions? Or at least feelings on the matter, but I'm scared, I love how things are at the moment and I don't want to fuck them up, but I fear if I enter into one of these conversations he'll see it as getting too serious and run. I'm happy with everything, except that I might just be a rebound. So, I do I ask him and risk messing things up to put my mind at rest (and possibly hearing something I don't want to - although, it would be hard to hear but I'd much rather know it so I can act accordingly) or do I just let things float along in this beautiful way we've fashioned and treat it like a new relationship? I love this man, sometimes, when I'm lying next to him, I can't get to sleep because I'm in awe of his beautiful face, his incredible mind, his wonderful soul and the fact that I'm lying next to him. TL;DR dated a guy [love of my life] for roughly two years, got a bit messy near the end with another girl (he didn't cheat or over lap) got back together with me, I cheated while he was away, got back with said girl but she broke up with him after a year, now we're hanging out and having fun, more grown up. I love him now just as much, if not more than the first time I told him I love him 4 years ago, do I talk to him about his feelings for the other girl or let things be? edit: WOT</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-10-16 00:00:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a million things to say to you, and not a single word to say it with. I remember the days back then when I'd just think about you and inspiration flowed through my fingers onto the paper, you loved the way I wrote, but now words are nothing but symbols to me, so bear with me while I try to translate my soul into letters. All but two of my most cherished memories of the last 5 years have been at your hand, and there's no denying that you improved my mindset and thus my life, directly or indirectly. I might still dislike myself immensely and be a mess, but I dread to wonder where I'd be if I hadn't met you all those years ago. I still remember how my initial fascination with you felt, the utter (and constant) disbelief that I was yours and the numbing pain when we broke up. My memories of you play like film scenes in my head, it's the most beautiful film I've ever watched, even the bad memories are dripping with passion and belong in any decent film. But you aren't perfect, you never have been, but it never bothered me, I had my ways around it, until now. I must confess, however, that something changed the first day you came over to mine after our trip. In the time we were apart, I missed you. Not a fleeting "I miss you, I can't wait to see you again" I'd been feeling previously, a gut wrenching, heart breaking *I fucking miss you* that just wouldn't quit. This scares me so much dude, and I'm starting to wish that you'd never reached out for my hand that night, we both know this path only leads to disaster sooner or later, can you see us playing friends this time? Sometimes, it makes me feel like a complete mug, we all know how I feel about you, I know it, you know it, he knows it, she knows it, they know it. Sometimes, I can't believe you expect me to keep that locked up when you kiss me on road sides, when you hold my naked body close to yours, when you wrap your arms around me and stare into my eyes through that song, when you rub your nose against mine with such tenderness. And this is the problem, there's a certain lack of freedom. I have to be careful when I speak to you, every word I utter is thought out to oblivion until it's stripped of nearly all emotion because I'll be damned if I screw this up again. I don't want commitment, I don't want promises, I don't want a facebook status, I don't want set days that I come to see you, I don't want to shout anything from the rooftops, I just want to be your favourite, to hear it and to have the freedom to tell you whenever it takes me that you are my favourite.  gt;*When you are flying around and around the world, and I'm lying a lonely, I know there's something sacred and free, reserved and received by me only.*  gt;*So save me, I'm waiting, I'm needing, hear me pleading. And soothe me, improve me. I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now.*  gt;*Nobody knows it, but you've got a secret smile and you use it only for me.*  gt;*So use it, and prove it, remove this whirling sadness. I'm losing, I'm bluesing, but you can save me from madness.* So here's what I need to get off my chest: * I love you. I fucking love you. * To this day, I get butterflies when our skin touches. * I was overwhelmed when my cat took an out of character liking to you, to see the two things I feel most strongly about curled up together on my bed almost bought me to tears. * I'm dead serious about building a tree house with you, I can already feel the awesomeness we'd build and create there. * You're still the most incredible person I've met, I really don't think I'll ever top it. * I'll never stop trying to be your equal, even if it's on hold for a while. * Please let me express how beautiful I really think you are. * I want you to come in closer. ^^and ^^a ^^bonus: ^^I ^^loved ^^it ^^when ^^you ^^sucked ^^my ^^toes ^^that ^^one ^^time, ^^it's ^^nothing ^^to ^^do ^^with ^^feet, ^^just ^^the ^^passion ^^behind ^^it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's in your Room 101, Reddit?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-10-29 14:00:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not talking about that crappy 90's British talk show, I mean George Orwell's Room 101. If you haven't read 1984 (you should) here are two extracts from it where O'Brien explains exactly what Room 101 is to Winston:  gt;"The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world."  gt;"By itself," he said, "pain is not always enough. There are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there is something unendurable - something that cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be disobeyed. It is the same with the rats. For you [Winston], they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure you cannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what is required of you." Since I first read the book years ago, I've always pondered what would be in my Room 101 but have never come up with anything solid. Sure, some things scare me but I can't think of anything that terrifies me to that extent. There is, of course, the torture, rape and deaths of my nearest and dearest but I don't get the feeling from the book that the Party would do anything like that, mainly because part of their plan is to eradicate feelings for other human beings completely, and this would only reinforce them while you're being "cured". So I'm interested to know, Reddit, what's in your Room 101?</TEXT>

I've tried to switch a couple of times but I found that turning veg was a doddle compared to turning vegan. So, I just want to hear about how some of you became vegan. What was a real challenge for you? How did you over come it? How long have you been vegan? What sort of support did you have? Slip ups? Anything about your journey. And as a side question, I know that as a veg, I feel a connection with both veggies and vegans, but do (some or in general) vegans only feel that connection with vegans? I know that I feel like I'm only doing a half arsed job as a vegetarian, and I wouldn't be surprised if vegans felt this way too.</TEXT>

Sometimes I think it's cute that we still get awkward around each other, it makes everything feel like the first time, every time, but today we only had a few hours, not enough time to play our roles. I was happy when we were together, just us being natural, no particular craving for intimacy, just utter content. But it's the afterwards, it's the realisation that you're gone for another two months and I missed my chance to wrap myself up in your arms. That'll make it four months since I felt your skin.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I've no one left and it's my own fault.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-12-29 18:01:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've systematically and thoroughly pushed everyone close to me away, and I've no idea why. I have two old friends left now, one being my ex-whom-I-still-love and another being a good friend. Neither of them live in our hometown anymore so I only get to see them when they come home, but thank god they always come to see me when they do. Just before Christmas, I went out with said good friend and a few mutual friends, one of them being my best friend, and the last person I pushed away. She was my partner in crime, she hated people and society just as much as I do, we understand each other on that talk-to-each-other-with-eyes level but for some reason I decided that I was done with her and (drunkenly) screamed at her. On Christmas day I tried to ring her to wish her Merry Christmas and tell her that I don't want to lose her forever but I can't be around her right now and that I've started writing a letter to her if she wants to read it. But she didn't pick up, she sent me a text saying "hello" and hour or so later, so I text her with what I just wrote, I didn't get a reply. I'm too proud to make the first move *again* and the letter didn't turn out so great, it just seemed to rip into her and that's not what I want to do. I want to open her eyes to what she's doing with her life but I don't have any new words to tell her, she's heard it from me all before and she'll sit and nod and listen and understand but nothing ever changes. The worst thing is, from my perspective of getting her back, she has plenty of friends (or at least acquaintances) that live a lot closer to her than I do, so it's easier for her to just get on with her own thing without me. I'm scared that without me she'll spiral down into oblivion, the people around her care about her just as much as I do, but I was her anchor to reality, and they're just pawns in this awful drama. I told them that night I was done with them and everyone from [their village]. I've also recently pissed off an incredible person, but this time without forgiveness. I honestly don't know what I did wrong here, but he sure doesn't want to talk to me. We don't talk that often anyway but he was always there for me if I needed him, and a lot of the time when I didn't. He was older than me, had about 10 years life experience on me and used to be a bouncer at the club I worked for. He saw through my flaws, my misdeeds and my anxieties and always made me feel like a good person. But now that's gone too and I have no one I respect to tell me I'm a good person. I recently slept with someone from the internet too. But it's not like that at all. We've known each other for a long time and been very good friends for at least a year. He used to be my GM before I left to make my own, more serious about raiding and arena, guild. He's 3 or 4 years younger than me, and I always knew he liked me, before he even admitted it. It was the first time we met up, and probably the last (it also happens to be the same night I fucked off my best friend) and I hate myself for it. I only slept with him because everyone else I was planning on pulling fell through and I wanted to feel wanted, which is just fucking vile. He's not complaining though, he was a virgin and it was actually some really good sex. It's just... I know what I'm like when I sleep with someone. Unless they were a REALLY good fuck, or someone I wanted a bit more than sex from, I won't stick around, I lose respect for said guy and stop talking to them. I'm scared this will happen with my old GM, as he's not playing retail anymore and I can't be bothered with private servers, so we don't really have a platform to communicate. He keeps asking me to play DOTA2 and DayZ with him but I just don't want to, I know he's expending a lot of energy trying not to obsess over me. This is getting far longer than I planned, and I'm not even half way done. I actually want someone to read it too :( But on the other hand I've come to a block. The point, or the **TL;DR** is that I'm very lonely, it's my own fault, I have a shit load of potential as a person but I have trouble leaving my house and all I do is reddit, play wow, and smoke weed, and have done for the past two years or so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And now I don't even know what to write, ha. So I wanted to give you guys something interesting, something other than a face shot of a girl to sketch, but then I realised that I can't give you much more than that because I'm a girl with a face. [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/W1UEV) a collection of photos of me and someone very special to me. We make an awesome team, in fact, I'm writing a short story based around our friendship at the moment (not as self indulgent as it sounds) and I'd be absolutely honored if someone took their artistic license and went crazy. He's an incredibly interesting person (me not so much) and far be it for me to tell you what to draw so maybe some facts about us you could incorporate? * We've starting playing DOTA2 together, we're noobs but in general he plays [Weaver](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=weaver+dota2 amp;sugexp=chrome,mod%3D5 amp;um=1 amp;ie=UTF-8 amp;hl=en amp;tbm=isch amp;source=og amp;sa=N amp;tab=li amp;biw=1920 amp;bih=922 amp;sei=OB3tULX1K6Ge0QWRrIHQBg#um=1 amp;hl=en amp;safe=off amp;tbo=d amp;tbm=isch amp;spell=1 amp;q=weaver+dota+2 amp;sa=X amp;ei=OB3tULC4NeeS0QWRmYCABA amp;ved=0CFUQBSgA amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf. amp;bvm=bv.1357316858,d.d2k amp;fp=e8c9bd18b5f2ec37 amp;biw=1920 amp;bih=922) and I play [Death Prophet](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=weaver amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enGB508GB508 amp;aq=f amp;sugexp=chrome,mod%3D5 amp;um=1 amp;ie=UTF-8 amp;hl=en amp;tbm=isch amp;source=og amp;sa=N amp;tab=wi amp;ei=dxjtUKHBN4fB0gXNoYGABA amp;biw=1920 amp;bih=922 amp;sei=eRjtUO6EHLCk0AWOn4D4Bg#um=1 amp;hl=en amp;safe=off amp;tbo=d amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enGB508GB508 amp;tbm=isch amp;sa=1 amp;q=death+prophet amp;oq=death+pr amp;gs_l=img.3.2.0l10.49690.50569.2.52599.8.7.0.1.1.0.51.341.7.7.0...0.0...1c.1.tJhG_xE9vZ8 amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf. amp;bvm=bv.1357316858,d.d2k amp;fp=e8c9bd18b5f2ec37 amp;biw=1920 amp;bih=922) * I play WoW and my main is a frost/arcane Undead female mage. * He bought me a book and a Return of the Jedi smoking tin for Christmas, I bought him a dodecahedron rubik's cube. * He juggles/breaths fire in his spare time, skateboards, roller blades, gymnastics, stargazes, climbs buildings he shouldn't. * We're both ents. * We like to travel/hitch hike, some of the photos in the album are from our summer trip to mainland Europe. He's been to every continent bar the Arctics. * We both own cats, you could go so far as to say that our respective cats are our best friends. There's a (very bad webcam) photo of me with his cat in the album. * He studies Ecology at university, I used to study Philosophy (But not at uni, college drop out :( ) * When we meet up, it's almost guaranteed that we'll have a conversation about our Zombie Apocalypse plans, he thinks he's got his sorted but I still poke holes in it. * We used to [urbex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration) together. So there we have it, possibly the longest post in the history of /r/redditgetsdrawn, but please, do whatever you like with all of this information, even if it's nothing at all, I'll be overjoyed at any sort of response. Edit: Oh, I have dreads now, you can see them in the first and last photo of me but it's not very obvious. And the guy with me in the photo where I'm pulling a face is not the guy we're talking about here haha.</TEXT>

I smoked loads of cigarettes, I controlled my breathing, I couldn't calm down for what must have been an hour, just a whirlwind of rage spinning around in my room, I've never felt like that before. Self harm never leaves you, it always stays with you, you always know you'll go back to it in times of crisis, but you live without it, you smoke, you starve, you find new habits and addictions to replace it but it never goes away, it's who you are, it's just the most honest and purest form of self destruction. I'm 21 years old, I didn't try and stop cutting, I grew out of it, it started slowly about two/three years ago until I wasn't doing it at all. I don't know how I feel about it. I just needed to tell someone because I have an impulse to and I am not that attention seeking whore anymore... if I ever was.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Non-vegan foods that caught you out?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-24 08:48:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there /r/vegan :) I'm a vegetarian but I'm dying to be a vegan. I'm taking it slowly because it's not easy, I live with a low-income meat eating family, so I'm starting by cutting out my arch nemesis - cheese. When I turned vegetarian, I was surprised to find a lot of things that I *thought* were veggie weren't, gummy bears and gelatin sweets for example. Purely ignorance and it seems silly to think I once thought they were vegetarian now. So I wondered, what are some things you thought were vegan but turned out not to be? I know we have to be careful with pasta, and that so many things have egg-white powder in them, and I will of course read ingredients properly, but I'm just interested into what caught you out. Edit: Thank you all for your replies so far! They've been unbelievably helpful, I've learnt so much already and there's only a handful of comments, you guys are awesome.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Advice] I need some help with ideas for my male character's past.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-30 04:48:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>A little context: My story is set in the present, with only two characters; an English early to mid twenties straight couple. They're hitch hiking around Europe until they wake up in a house/cabin only to find their host, his truck and their bags gone, with all the windows and doors locked. The story follows them as some weird shit goes down (by which I mean, events outside the boarders of reality) and we explore how they react, how they change and how they interact. Although she's not based on me entirely, my female character is a lot easier to develop because I can incorporate some of my own daemons into her past. My male character needs *something* to haunt him because he's ultimately the main character, yet the reader sees more depth in my female so far. Here are some ideas I came up with and almost instantly dismissed: * He used to be abusive to an ex girlfriend, or perhaps even his current. (Even though he will have changed, I don't want him to be that kind of person) * He was molested as a child/teenager. (I have no emotional experience with this and don't think I could portray it accurately.) * He killed someone, possibly by accident. (This is too close to one of my female's daemons. I don't want too many "ghosts of people you've wronged" floating about) * He lost someone close to him. (This could work if they were missing and not dead, but again with the ghosts floating around) And that's all I have. Even though the title says so, I'm not necessarily looking for something from his past, and all my ideas so far have been rather dramatic, I'd rather it be a bit more subtle. I just need to get the ball rolling on him, I'd really appreciate any ideas you might have. :)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-02-03 19:17:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>He was my boyfriend a long time ago, now he's one of my best, if not my best friend and we ~~usually~~ always end up sleeping together when we're in the same city. I've always been kinky and when we were together and younger, we indulged a little (handcuffs, spanking, hair pulling, etc) but since then my sexuality has grown, I've had other partners and I've had wilder and wilder fantasies. But there's something about having sex with him that I just can't put my finger on, something mind blowing. No matter how kinky sex with someone else can get, it's never topped even the most vanilla, two naked bodies under bed sheets in missionary, sex with him. So a week or so ago I asked him how much he knew about BDSM, he said not much and I proceeded to explain a few things and told him to have a read through some communities here on reddit. He said he'd be up for trying some stuff but nothing was said after that. I didn't want to push it cause I thought I'd been a bit full on, and I can imagine this kind of stuff can be quite intimidating if you've been asked to look at it and not developed the fetish naturally yourself. But yesterday I rang him and we ended up having a long conversation about BDSM, mainly dom/sub topics and I think it's clicked with him that it's so much more than just tying someone up and fucking them. It was a much more positive and excitable conversation, ending with him telling me we should stop because it was getting a little heavy when he has to share a tent with four other lads that night, ha. He told me to tell him some things I like/think I would like so I said I'd text him throughout the night (I work at a bar that's open until 6am) I only got to four texts because we got busy, but I suppose that just leaves more things to discuss at a later date, which is always fun. He text me back this morning telling me he liked all of my ideas, especially blah and blah. He then told me he wanted me to buy a pair of long socks and some tights for the next time he sees me. His first command, and my first task. I haven't stopped giggling like the excited little girl that I am. I can't wait to go shopping, I swear I'll be wet the whole time, I hope I get it right for him. Wish us luck /r/BDSMcommunity :) TL;DR: My ex-boyfriend turned best friend may soon become the dom of my fantasies :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Your veganism and your ideas about abortion.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-04-08 16:03:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>How do you feel about abortion? For the sake of this particular question let's remove from the equation abortions after rape, abortions of children that will live with a horrible terminal disease and just stick to the generic *two people made a mistake and aren't ready for a baby*. Are these reasons linked to the same ethics you hold as a vegan? If you're "pro-choice", what is the difference in your eyes between a chicken egg and a human fetus? Personally, I've had an abortion, when I was 18, I was a vegetarian but not a vegan back then. I'm still pro-choice but if my birth control failed now I wouldn't do it again. I made that decision though before I became a vegan and I think the two are linked only via my views on the rights we have as humans to take and give life. So, let's hear your views :).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I don't know if I'm being raped or if I'm just easy.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-09-05 06:22:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>It sounds really stupid, I know, but for the longest time, to me rape was being jumped in an alley late at night and physically restrained by a stranger, and that's never happened to me. But then I read statics like 85% of rape victims already knew their rapist and things about how s/he deals with it afterwards and why most of them don't get reported. So my idea of what rape is became a bit more realistic. Anyway, that was years ago now. I'm 22 years old and I've had a lot of sex, a lot of sex that I've been happy to have. But over the last year or so, as the novelty of the freedom to have sex with whom I want wears off, or as I grow and tire of flings and fuck buddies, or perhaps I was using sex for an emotional gain and it's no longer enough or works, I've not been enjoying sex or the aftermath as much as I once did, or even at all. I can count three times this year, twice in the last month where I've said the word "no" but still ended up having sex. Not that it hasn't happened before but these are the most recent. They aren't strangers, they're people I've flirted with. In fact, in each of these three incidents I'd kissed each guy once before. I suppose it would make sense right now to outline what happened if I want anyone to help me come to an answer. I don't know if I want an answer or if I just need to write this down. The first was someone I'd clicked with in a major way, but he had a girlfriend, and I was too seeing someone, although it was clearly coming to an end when I met this guy. I work in a bar and these are all regulars, but everyone mixes with everyone, we're one big incestuous scene. One night he invited me back to his after work, which isn't weird, that was just the place everyone went after the clubs have closed, and a bunch of people were going so I went. I'd actually agreed to come back with him on the condition that he understood we won't be having sex. We'd *almost* kissed a week earlier at the bar, but we stopped ourselves. We were the last to get out of the taxi, and as everyone piled inside, he stopped me and asked me for a kiss, and I kissed him and it was wonderful. Inside, everyone was chilling, smoking, drinking, sniffing, playing games, listening to music, laughing and we stole a couple more kisses in the kitchen (Okay so I kissed this guy three times before hand) but I maintained my no sex stance. Eventually everyone left and it was just the two of us, on his bed, making out. I don't remember how it got to that stage, it was a while ago now. But I remember him asking me for sex a number of times and me saying no, but still kissing him. I wanted to have sex with him so badly, I'd wanted him for months, but *he had a girlfriend* and I just didn't want to be that girl. In the end, I was pushing my hand against his pubic bone with his cock literally a centimeter away from my pussy saying "no, stop it, please" and then giving in. We had sex and it was brilliant. I didn't regret it in the morning, although I did feel a little odd. He ended up breaking up with his girlfriend later that week and we saw each other for a good few months. Nothing like that ever happened again, but then again he had no girlfriend making me feel guilty. The second was actually a rebound from the former. I'd had an argument with him earlier that night and asked #2 if he wanted to come back to mine for a smoke. He was a good guy, I thought. He was sweet, he was everything the guy before wasn't. We've flirted for years, he used to log onto his Dad's WoW account to play with me (didn't like me enough to buy his own huh) and a year or so ago we'd gone for a little date in the park. Nothing came of it and he left my life. Then he started coming to my bar and we had a kiss. Then I started seeing the other guy. So back to my room. I thought he was the kind of guy that would just give me a little cuddle, he's never been in my room before, he's not the kind of guy to go from a kiss months ago to sex. He wants to take it slowly, surely, after all the sweet things he's been saying to me. And I just wanted a cuddle from someone who cares. Dickhead #1 had fucked with my head and left me feeling worthless and confused. I'm sick of being lonely. He gets into bed and strips down into his boxers and I'm thinking, oh wow okay, so I guess you're comfortable. I don't, I fumble around telling him I'm looking for some pajamas, but all my washing is in the fucking washing machine because I'm a lazy bitch and leave it until I have literally nothing left to wear, which is completely true and all I could do was find the longest top I could, which actually came down to my knees. I get into bed, he puts his arm around me, I stiffen up and don't respond. I make idle conversation, keep my eyes fixed to the screen and my hand on the mouse. He starts to feel me up, he's on MDMA, I can tell by the way he's touching me, I still don't respond but I also don't say anything. He tries to pull my head towards him to kiss me but I don't let him, shake my head and go back to watching the screen. He rubs me through my knickers and I moan a little because I can't help it, but I don't look at him. He tries to put his hands inside my knickers but I pull his hand away and tell him no, and look at him with eyes I'm hoping are saying "please understand me, please stop" He gets on top of me and kisses me all over, I don't really like it but there's not much I can do to stop him. Then there's a series of what feels like to me moments of "giving in". I let him kiss me, I let him put his hands down my pants after some protest and when he's on top of me, trying to push himself inside of me, and I'm saying "no" his tone completely changes and he says "do you want to fuck or not?" and I sigh, let him inside me and put his hand around my throat, because we're not even going to pretend this means anything. I don't know why I did it. I should have said "no, no I do not want to fuck." I ended up crying for two hours while he slept and then waking him up and kicking him out. The third guy was also someone I'd flirted with we'd had a kiss about a month ago but I'd told him "now is not the time, I'm still not really finished with #1" and he seemed to understand and he tried nothing else. Last night I went out with the the bar staff at work and we ended up at one of the DJ's flats, which is also just one of those houses everyone goes to when the clubs close. Same crowd. I was twisted, I couldn't see straight. I'd tried to play CoD but the chick I was against was killing me before I'd even had chance to turn around. I ended up giving the controller to someone else and blabbing on about if I had a mouse and keyboard I'd kick your ass any day. Not important. Anyway, I'd retired to a bedroom and hijacked someone's bed because I wanted to lie the fuck down in a bit of quiet. I wasn't in the bed, or de-clothed, I just crashed there. He came in and started cuddling me and I didn't mind because I'd been free of Dickhead for a while, in person and in my mind. We ended up passionately kissing and again, he tried to put his hands down my knickers and I said no, but they ended up inside me some how. I wouldn't have minded having sex with him, but I just didn't want it then, I wanted to get to know this one. I said to him "Do you really want to have sex with me in [DJ]'s bed, when there's a shit tonne of people out there, and I'm this wasted?" and he laughed and said fair point. Later that night (well, day) when everyone was going home, I was waiting for my taxi in another bed room, but this time I was crashed out in the bed. I was facing the wall, back to the door, he came in, started to cuddle and finger me, but I was so drunk I didn't even turn around or move much. He tried to put my hand on his dick and I pulled it away, and he said something about having a big dick and saying "come on" and then he was inside of me. I don't even know. Seriously, I thought it was his fingers and after a few second I was like "hold up, this is a dick" and proceeding to say "stop it, oh my god [name] please stop" before eventually pushing him off. There's events like this dotted all around my life, perhaps I haven't said no as much as I have in the ones I just told you. But there's always a sense of "why am I doing this" *at the time it's happening*, and horrible regret the next day, feeling absolutely filthy and disgusting. You know that feeling you get when you're finished jacking off and your porn is still on your screen? It's like that times a thousand. And I don't understand why I don't just say no when it comes to crunch time, or why I don't put up more of a fight, or am I just a big tease? Am I leading these guys on? I sort of feel obliged to sleep with them, I don't know. So shit, that was super long. And my writing got just awful by the end, sorry about that. If you did take the time to read this, thank you so much. Honestly, it's helped me just writing this all out and not having it in my head. **TLDR; I'm probably just a massive slut.** Edit: To those of you downvoting, I want to hear your opinions too. I didn't write this to be told I'm a lovely innocent girl, I need some truth and clarity in my fucking life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Something odd I noticed about Chandler's relationship to the group</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-09 19:13:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>As we know from the episode The One Where They Almost (I think it's called that, the one where Janis asks if any of them have almost had sex and we get flashbacks) which is set a few weeks/months before episode one; * Ross still lives with Carol, this is the time where the group finds out she is gay (we find out in episode one) * Chandler already lives next door to Monica. This means that, because we don't know when Chandler moved in, either; 1. It was a strange coincidence that he moved next door to his old college room-mate's grandma. 2. He, for some weird reason, chose to move next door to his old room-mate's sister, with the future not looking like Ross would be around any time soon. So I feel there was no need to make Chandler and Ross old college room-mates as the group would have come together just as well if he'd simply been Monica and Phoebe's next-door neighbour. Hopefully I have missed something, I just wanted to see Reddit's thoughts on this.</TEXT>

Then shortly after I'm hungry again so I'll have a snack, but it doesn't take long before I'm hungry again and I find myself thinking on a regular basis "are you serious? You're hungry AGAIN?" I'm not a fussy eater by any means, nor do I have any EDs but I don't have a big appetite even when I am hungry and thus cooking and eating feel like a chore to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Birmingham Pubstomp</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-07-04 17:15:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I work in a pub in Birmingham, about 20 mins walk, 5 mins bus from New Street station, less from Snow Hill. We're show a lot of sports and thus have about a thousand TVs and it'd be very easy for me to reserve the front room for us for the finals, being as they're on a Monday, perhaps even the Losers Bracket on the Sunday too. I know someone was trying to sort out a Pubstomp in Notts but I think Birmingham is easier to get to/more central and it's not a busy Weatherspoons, we'll have a room and a bar to ourselves. We do amazing food (not blowing my own trumpet, I'm a barmaid not a chef) and have ales and lagers from all over the world and all the spirits you can think of. The only problem would be connecting a laptop up to the TVs but I can't imagine with a room full of PC users that would be too hard. We have two different WiFis so if one's a bit slow we can switch to the other. I only play dota with about 6 real life friends and it wouldn't feel worth it for the 7 of us, we'd just do it at one of our houses, so I just want to see if there's any interest with two weeks to go to the big event. If there is enough interest I'll get my brain in gear and put on things like sweepstakes, drinking games, dota themed drinks/food, I'll be your prefect hostess and we'll watch TI4 in style! *Edit:* Just got home from work, more interest than I thought over the two threads! This is pretty awesome. My manager said it will be fine and my supervisor got rather excited! I've set up a facebook account to keep everyone updated together, spread the word and share some ideas. It's not an event it's an actual account as I don't use facebook myself anymore, plus, no annoying notifications! [Link](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004821041085) It will be hosted at [The Lord Clifden](http://thelordclifden.com/) and I forgot to mention that, unfortunately, it's not a family pub which means over 18s only. BUT if a lot of people that want to come are under 18 maybe we can set up some kind of system, like wrist bands. I'll do my best to work things out, I've got a few ideas. *Edit II:* Talked to my boss and we don't have a license for under 18s I'm afraid. If you are over 18 and look young you should bring some ID as they will be IDing you just in case.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Birmingham Pubstomp [Update]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-07-16 18:29:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys! So it's all confirmed and stuff, it's all going ahead :). We're not on the official pubstomp website though, I think I may have left it a little late for that, so no free stuff :(. Anyway, some information: * Hosted at [The Lord Clifden](http://www.thelordclifden.com) [(Maps)](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Lord+Clifden/@52.490237,-1.909212,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4870bceb7bdfb3e9:0xf721545128fb4136) on Monday 21st July. * The room is ours from 4pm on wards but feel free to come whenever you like. There's darts, table top footy, ping pong and drinks and food to occupy us until kick off. * Over 18s only * Bring ID regardless, they'll be checking. * Entry is free * There's various P amp;P parking around the side streets, but on Hockley St, just round the corner from the pub, there's free parking for about 10 cars * I couldn't recommend any hotels as I've never had to get one in Birmingham but I know there's a couple of cheap ones near by. [The Bloc Hotel](http://www.blochotels.com/bloc-birmingham.html) and [Hatter's Backpacker's Hostel](http://hattersgroup.com/). * Buses you can get from the centre are the **16**, **16A**, **74** and **75**. About 3 minutes after you pass Snow Hill station (because I don't know where you'll be getting on) there'll be a Tesco on your left. You can get off there or the next stop (which is a little closer) But it's only a 20 min walk! You sit down enough! * Buses finish at around midnight. * We've got the front room to ourselves, as soon as you walk in the door just turn right through another set of doors. * DOTA2 themed fancy dress is more than welcome. * When it comes to streaming vs in game we'll have a hand vote on the day. Anything else you need to know, just ask me :). If you're planning on coming please post here so I can get an idea of numbers (And how many people you're coming with). Also, I need a little help. I don't have a HDMI cable and unless I buy one (which I will if I have to) I'm struggling to get my hands on one. Also, although I have a PC, laptop and 1080p phone at hand to use but a PC is impracticable, the laptop is out of date and the phone is... a phone. So if anyone's willing to lend me a hand with a decent laptop I'll buy them a drink! And I promise nothing will happen to your precious. And last but not least, is there anything you'd like to see? Someone suggested name badges with steam and real names, I can organise that if you like. Any ideas for drinking games? P.S. Let's play a few games together before we meet up! Break the ice a little. [This is my steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/14hours), I'll be playing tonight, most of tomorrow day and Friday night. *Please don't add me if you're not coming to the pubstomp.* And add each other!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Old Distopian Film</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-02 15:30:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>All I can remember from the plot is that society instantly kills you when you reach your 30th birthday, youre considered obsolete. Perhaps the protagonist is an outsider, too, or a prisoner. The only scene I remember is an execution scene. Its set in a big circle auditorium, a big crowd and 5-10 30 year olds dressed in white robes in the centre. Then I swear they begin to float high up before exploding. I THINK its a colour film, but my memory may serve me wrong. I remember it being the first time I came across abstract, utopian ideas about the future and really enjoying the concept and possibilities. Now I'm all about the Brave New World/1984 thing and it'd be nice to revisit the piece of work that initially sparked my curiosity. Edit/ Thanks all, it was Logan's Run and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSUAAKFLoL0) was the scene I was thinking about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My housemate talks too much.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-14 01:49:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love him to bits, he's been one of my closest friends for 6/7 years but the only time I get a break from the chatter is when he's asleep or at work. He lives with me rather than us living together in a one bedroom flat so his bed is set up in the living room. Not a problem for him but definitely one for me. Having spent most my life in my mom's house and a short time in a shared house, I've always wanted my entertainment (namely my pc and my books) in a room other than my bedroom, which I now have. But he doesn't have his own laptop and we don't own a TV so if I'm in the living room he's always involved in what I'm doing. This means that I can't browse reddit without being asked a thousand questions, I can't play games without being asked a thousand questions, I have to watch things that we both enjoy (which, honestly isn't much of a problem as we have very similar tastes) and I have to engage in conversation when I've just done a ten hour shift in my bar. He's very easy going and laid back and respects that it's my flat but omg, just close your lips for five minutes please. Today he told me he was an advocate of silence and I laughed at him and told him he hasn't shut his mouth since he got here. He's one of those people that has to have an answer for everything, even if he's not asked and half the time he's not even right, which is the most annoying part. I generally don't talk unless I can say my words with true conviction and passion and am happy to say "I don't know" or admit when I'm wrong. Anyway, I love him, I just wanted to rant while he slept.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My boyfriend stopped sleeping with me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-28 14:29:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>He says he has a low sex drive but it's been a month now since we've done anything sexual and two since we've actually had sex. We are young (23 and 25) and I just can't believe that a 25 y/o lad can go 2 months without having sex. Obviously it's affecting my self esteem a hell of a lot. Why don't I turn him on anymore? I was blonde for a year and half, which is the colour that suits my skin tone the least so in light of my sexless relationship I decided to change a bit a dyed it red. I can't go back to blonde because red is a bitch to get out, but I can go darker if you think I should. I don't wear a lot of make up, never have, make up is not who I am or what I look like. Although I won't leave the house without mascara on. Anyway; The most made up I'll ever be, hair done and full make up for a wedding: http://i.imgur.com/hxPERBc.jpg Normal make up, normal hair: http://i.imgur.com/09vNkYR.jpg The only full body picture I could find: http://i.imgur.com/fy0jJsG.jpg Red, normal make up, don't usually straighten my hair: http://i.imgur.com/sb27UnP.jpg Five mins ago, no make up, spots and all, just woke up, normal hair: http://i.imgur.com/vvm48O6.jpg Ps. Sorry about the blurry pictures, my phone is a potato and I have shaky hands. I'll take all advice except ones that tell me to take my piercings out, just not gonna happen. Plus I only want to be sexy for my man, and he has piercings too. Edit: Thank you *everyone* for your comments. I'll confess that I didn't necessarily come here for advice and more to just have someone tell me I wasn't ugly, I didn't expect it to blow up this much. However, a lot of good points have come out of this and I'm not just going to take them into consideration, I will be doing something about them. In regards to my appearance; I'm going to dye my hair darker red, much darker and more subtle and I'm going to try all kinds of products to get it looking healthy again. I think I'm going to keep it curly because I've been straightening it all my life until half way through this year, it's a nice change and it'll be better for my hair. I'll check out /r/curly. Also I'm going to part my hair nearer to the center. Make up is not a major issue for me, contradictory to my emotional issues I actually have enough confidence to wear very little and I have my boyfriend to thank for that. Although I will do myself up a little more for work. I was looking through old facebook photos and I forgot I used to wear eyeliner on the top of my eyes with a little flick in the corner. I'm going to start doing that again, it definitely suited me and bought out (what I believe to be) my best feature (my green eyes). I think the main problem though, is how washed out and exhausted I look. I need to change some major things in my life just to be a little happier. I'm going to stop smoking weed and cigarettes, try and work on my diet (although I have a horrible relationship with food), stop sleeping in all day or sitting on DOTA all day when I'm not at work and try and get some exercise in. In regards to my boyfriend; I have and do talk to him, reddit is not my first resort but one of my last. I don't want to soil every time I see him with heavy conversations. He came over last night and we had a good time, we laughed and played card games and we do love each other, we really do, we're just both a bit fucked up at the moment. On reflection there's not much wrong apart from the lack of intimacy, he does care about me a lot. the lack of intimacy is his problem though and I'm just going to have to give it time. There's a few non emotional things he's dealing with that should be sorted out by the end of the week so we'll see how things are after that. I don't understand but I can accept not having sex, it's just the lack of any physical contact. We hugged once and kissed once and I had to ask for both and that's hard. I lay in bed after he left and my heart hurt. As we were falling asleep I stroked his hair and back and he let out little pleasure moans so I know he's not completely adverse to it. He turned over from his front to face me half asleep and I picked up his hand and put it round my body and he pulled me in tighter, so it's not that he doesn't want it, maybe I'll try and be a little more forward with physical contact (but not sexual, I'm not pushing that if he doesn't want it, I would hate it if someone was doing that to me) Again, thank you everyone. If you want to follow my story I'll probably be posting on /r/deadbedrooms but for now I'm going to spend the day with my mom because I haven't seen her in ages and what's better than a mother's hug when you're feeling low?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Orginal post](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/2kkkkq/my_boyfriend_stopped_sleeping_with_me/) So, we broke up. But I'm not here to talk about that. Although I was adamant in the last post the make up wasn't an issue for me, it's my make up that I've worked on the most. My hair is a work in progress, but I think it's starting to look healthier already. As per the suggestions in the last thread I now part my hair much closer to the middle (but not quite) and completely did away with the blush and replaced it with bronzer. I also started to fill in my eyebrows, which I'm still practicing so any tips would be great. But please bear in mind that I'm currently growing out my eyebrows to get them threaded professionally because I've fucked up the shape of them on my own, so they look a bit messy at the moment. Every day make up before: * Tinted moisturiser * Powder * Blush * Mascara Every day make up now: * Tinted moisturiser * Concealer/highlighter * Powder * Bronzer * Eyebrow pencil * Eyebrow Mascara * Eye shadow * Eye liner * Mascara So! Pictures! The best picture illustrating the change from blush to bronzer (because you can't really see it face on) My hair is unwashed and tied back http://imgur.com/5djICLG Trying to show the eye shadow http://imgur.com/SOlWxin Full on face, normal hair http://imgur.com/6Kodcdw Unfortunately I still can't do anything about the size of my forehead, and ignore the clothes, work. My face look pretty flat in these pictures but I don't think it look that flat in real life, or maybe it does? Oh, bonus cat picture http://imgur.com/OV7t2cu</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-02-19 16:04:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bit of back story; I'm dating a guy who's been with three girls, me being the third but I think he might have bumped that up and has really only been with one girl before me. He knows what he's doing, got the basics down, doesn't forget the clit and the tits but there's a lot of room for improvement. I don't want to embarrass him or emasculate him but you know, all girls are different and what worked for her doesn't necessarily work for me. Would you rather just work it out on your own by her reactions? Would you like to sit down and have a conversation about what turns her on and what doesn't? Would you like her to tell you while you're doing it? Or have her move your hand or herself into positions she finds pleasurable? Or something else? Ps. *This is not a question about a specific guy, I'm trying to get a general consensus of how men feel about this to help me with the only man I'm dealing with at the moment.* Edit: Thanks guys! Out of 50 responses only two said not to say anything so I think we're on to a winner here! For any girls reading this, what I've learned is: * Better to do it during sexy time * Use words and actions, not hints and moans * Use positive sentences like "I like it when you do this" * Go for it!</TEXT>

Found a dapper vest on my first few days but I didn't know what it was for so I wore it and ran it down to about 20%. Also I see that my berries and farms aren't growing very fast, if at all, so how do I sustain food through the winter?

There was a dwarf hamster in a tiny cage, which isnt so bad but his water bottle tip was rusty, his bedding was filthy, he was right by the door in direct midday sunlight and obviously terrified. Ofc theres the possibility that someone here in Spain will buy him and look after him properly but being human and selfish I'll only be worrying about him. I'm willing to break laws to bring him home but I understand that the xray machines and high altitude will probably kill him. Just need some advice, I can't stop thinking about him, if I was back in England I would have bought him then and there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Light] I'm 24 and up until now my life has been one of idealism and dreams of social freedom. Talks of how communism would have worked had they not shot Lennin. Dreams of living in hand built tree houses or travelling vans, living off the grid and on the land. I've squatted (lived rent free in abandoned/unoccupied buildings) traveled across Europe with no money, dreaded my hair, tattooed and pierced weird places, had a pet snake, kept late night jobs, spent the weekends in forests or on the top of tall buildings and structures instead of going to clubs, hardcore played video games that aren't fifa or gta, suffered with extreme self harm and suicide attempts, kinky sex, deep appreciation of the stars and the trees, contemplation of the real truth, philosophy essays, the search for enlightenment, love and soul mates as the be all and end all, experimenting with hallucinogenics, alternative films and music, computer/Internet obsession before Facebook ruled the world, 4chan, ogrish, rotten.com. But now the weirdest thing about me is that I live in a house far too big for my income. The last time I left the country I did it in hotels. I have a boyfriend whom I love on a safe and not scary omg you're the only thing in the world level. I'm pretty sure I'm going to marry him and have his 2.4 kids and we're going to live in a lovely suburban house with two cars on the drive and I'll get a 9-5 and cook him dinner when he comes home from a hard graft and we'll watch Netflix til bed time (afterall, Netflix is this generations TV) and I'll love every minute of it until I remember I used to want to see the world and live off the grid and spend my days contemplating philosophy and love and not contribute to the joke we call modern society and pay our corrupt governments to fuck us over bit by bit. I fear for that day, it will be full of regret but I'm already rolling at full speed on this normal path and for now, structure and normality seem to be what I need.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Raising children in a vegan household?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-11-27 12:28:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>We're not fully vegan yet but by the time me and my boyfriend are trying for children I expect we'll both have been vegan for a while. Of course, I want my children to be vegetarian at least but I don't want to force it upon them, I'd like them to make the decision because they believe its the right thing to do, not because mommy and daddy do it. My main concern is that most children arbitrarily rebel against their parents. I watched it happen with my cousin. He was bought up vegetarian but at 15 his parents thought him old enough to make his own decisions and has been eating meat ever since. Of course every child is different, my older cousins were also bought up veg and are still veg into their 30s. I also don't want my children to feel singled out or "different". Growing up isn't easy and children are cruel, I don't wish to make my kid's life harder because of my beliefs. And I've read and heard that there are certain proteins only accessible through meat and eggs that babies need to grow up healthily. Of course I'll do more research into this closer to the time. So the answer seems to be, and what I've always thought, to bring them up as omnivores and keep them informed of both sides of the story. Don't push them in one direction or the other and just hope they reach the same decision I did. HOWEVER, the idea of putting dead animals into my baby's mouth makes me sick to my stomach and want to cry. I just don't think I could do it. What are your ideas and experiences? What do you think the most moral and fair thing to do is? I know I wrote a lot about me but believe it or not I made this post to hear your thoughts.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-12-28 19:33:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>We've been keeping fish for a while so I understand the basics but I want to tailor my new tank so its perfect for a Betta. With our Christmas money me and my SO decided to get individual project tanks and I wanted a beautiful Betta. I'm aiming to house a mustard gas rosetail or a really frilly halfmoon. First of all, is my tank too small? I have a 20 litre (5 gal) tank, with filter, heater, air pump and four plants. [Set up](http://imgur.com/zKdB4gS) [With my small hand close to the glass for scale](http://imgur.com/ecMi3x0) I know a lot of people say 1 gallon min but I'd rather have the happiest fish I can. It looked pleanty big when it was empty in the store but after setting and filling it up I'm having doubts. How fragile are Betta fins? Bare in mind I'm searching for the frilliest fins I can find. I didn't buy any pretty ornaments or hiding places because it all just seemed so sharp and rough! Are any of those plants (all live) potential fin rippers? After the fish's happiness, aesthetics is my biggest concern. It's next to my monitor on my desk so I'll be spending a lot of time looking at it. I've gone for a light pink substrate with white stones to help anchor the plants because pink is my favourite colour and I think it'll compliment the blues, yellows and creams of a mustard gas. I'd like an orniment too, something peaceful and light that the Betta can utilise for stimulation or hiding. Any ideas on upping the creativity of the look? Another concern is that I don't just want a Betta in the tank! I'm planning on adding a few ember tetras, cherry shrimp and a small algee eater. Would this completely overcrowd the tank? What sort of tiny algee eater is compatible with Bettas? To reduce the risk of aggression, is it better to introduce other fish into the tank before or after I've added the Betta? Any other ideas on making the tank prettier or tricks and tips on making my fish happier are more than welcome! One last question, I live in England, where's the best place for me to buy healthy, beautiful fish? Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just wanted to show my appreciation for this sub! I've been around for a while, lurking in the shadows nibbling on my cheese and I just think you're all (mostly!) wonderful people. I wish the rest of the world had access to this community, they wouldn't think us so self righteous and preachy and stay away from us if they understood how welcoming and caring (for all animals, including humans!) the community really is. A lot of communities claim to be welcoming, then get all angsty when they've been asked the same question 5 times, but you guys neither claim to be welcoming, nor push anyone away who's asking "can I eat honey?". You seem to understand that reposts are a good thing because it opens the topic up to new and fresh ideas or exposes the notion to people who didn't see the first post. And those who don't get downvoted to the ground. Reddit's hivemind has no jurisdiction here! I feel like I'm surrounded by a thousand wise and respected big brothers and sisters. I've always felt shit that my will power is so dire that I've taken years to slowly transition into veganism, but I come here and am met with understanding and tolerance like no other. My omnivore friends and family support me but don't understand, so it's lovely to have somewhere full of like minded, kind people. Thank you for being you /r/vegan!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Remorse] For anyone coming here to see if this is about you, this isn't a throw away so if you don't know my username this isn't about you and I'm sorry for getting your hopes up. I have a fantastic boyfriend, whom I wish to marry and mother his children. I have a good life, a lovely house, three beautiful cats and countless amazing fish. I'm happy. I'm happier than I've ever been in my entire life. It's because of him, so why can't I stop thinking about you? You were in my dream again last night. No, you *were* my dream. As I lay next to this amazing creature, who holds me closer than you ever did, my mind wonders to you. It's been over 18 months since we left each other emotionally and physically, 14 since we "officially" broke up and just under a year since we stopped speaking. I'm sick to death of thinking about you. My head is over you, I do not crave you, I do not love you, I do not need your touch. You were my first love and we spent a lot of years together, especially for how young we were, and I understand that I will always hold a flame for you, but this isn't a flame, this is a fucking bonfire burning my goddamn hands to the bone. The worst part is, you're not even the person I can't get over! How can I let go of something that doesn't exist, that I never had? How do I explain to my heart that my head made up a fantasy man and tacked it to you? It's driving me to insanity, I'm terrified I'm going to call out your name while I sleep, and then how will I explain to my already paranoid boyfriend that I want him and no one else? It's gotten to the point where I wish I'd never even met you, I'd give up all those amazing times and new experiences just to have a day of peace in my head. Where do I go from here? Any genuine advice would be lovely, but no telling me how *you think* I really feel. I know how I feel, I've spent the last for fucking ever thinking about it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>URGENT HELP NEEDED Elliotis currently laying eggs! I have no breeding experience or knowledge!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-07 22:55:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>My two largest Elliotis are laying eggs right now. My knife fish is trying to eat them. The Elliotis can keep all the other fish in the tank away but they don't even put up a fight against the black ghost knife fish. He ate a few and I shoo'd him off and they carried on laying. We have a spare filter and heater and can set up an impromptu tank to house them. Should I take the eggs out (on a plant) with the fish? Or without? Or should I just accept fate and let them spawn again when they are fully grown? We can house them later, we have a spare tank meant to be a planted tank but it's not set up yet. Edit\ Would there be any harm in this plan? I'm happy to watch them until they are done laying. We have put sand(the same kind in the tank) in a bucket and filled it with water from the tank. We can add a heater and filter too and an air pump(but at the expense of one of the other tanks). After they are done laying I could move them, the plant they have laid on and a couple of other plants. We could set up the planted tank, but ofc it would be rushed. I could buy a crap load of quick start and do medium water changes every day/other day and take readings every hour if needs be. It's also about time to change the filter media in the tank they live in so I could take a large chunk of it. Then when they're done parenting put them back in the main tank and raise the little elliotis in the planted. I just think, they're definitely not going to survive the night in that tank so if no mortal harm would come to the parents, isn't it worth a shot? Edit 2\ Sorry to double post, I'm not sure if that's against the rules but I'm thinking what if I put the knife fish and the asain sun cat fish, the two they can't fight off, in the planted tank? That would stop them from taking aggression out on each other as they can still chase off the other fish. Would also keep them happy and undisturbed and the knife fish and cat fish are hardier and could probably tolerate the forced cycle of the planted tank.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-01-17 13:23:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I went vegan in the new year so it's been two and half weeks. And I'm tired all the time. I really don't want it to be the change in my diet but nothing else in my life has changed, other than I've cut down significantly on cigarettes. I was vegetarian for ten years before 2016 and slowly fased out a lot of eggs and egg products over the years so the change to my diet hasn't been radical, all I've really done is drop dairy. The strangest part is, my SO is getting back into body building, but doing it vegan this time, so he's counting all his carbs, proteins, fats, fibre etc and because we cook for each other/have the same meals, by proxy I am also counting mine and I know I'm getting enough of everything. Today I got out of bed at about 10:30 am, had baked beans, two vegan sausages, two hash browns and a black coffee with one sugar for breakfast. By 12:30 pm I'm falling asleep on the sofa. I struggle with depression and whatnot and I know what that tiredness feels like. While there's still a physical aspect to it a lot of it is emotional and mental lethargy. This isn't that, it's not boredom either. My eyes are heavy, my legs are weak, I'm yawning, I have no energy, I'm tired! If it is my diet change, is it just my body getting used to it or is there something I am doing wrong/missing/not getting enough of? If it's not my diet, what is it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have a foot fetish, but my current and ex boyfriend do. The odd thing is, neither of them had one before we met. That's not to say my feet are so amazing I turn people. I love experimenting with sex and encouraging my partners to do the same and I think that given the opportunity and openness to see feet in a sexual way more people would be into it. But, I have no idea what I'm talking about because I don't see the attraction. I don't think feet are gross, I think feet are lovely but no more than any other part of the body. I just wanted to know more about it really and being as my bf is just discovering it himself he doesn't really have any answers! So here's some questions :) 1. Are there different types of feet? If so, is there a general consensus of what the best kind of foot is? (For example, while it widely varies, the typical hour glass shape for a lady is considered the most desirable in general) 1. How do you like your toe nails? 1. Is it just toes and soles or does anyone like heals and pads and the tops of feet? 1. How should a foot, or feet, interact with your dick (or vagina!)? 1. Are there any muscles that can be trained to give a better foot job? Or any tips and tricks on giving foot jobs? 1. What is your favourite position? Your favourite angle? 1. Toe and foot jewelry? Thoughts? 1. Anything else you want to say about feet? Don't spare me details!</TEXT>

I've done my research and, coupled with the work outs I'm doing, a low carb, high fat diet seems to be a good choice. I've been tracking my food and hitting my goals but I'd like to lower my carbs a little more. The problem is, as you know, most of our protein sources come with loads of carbs! I'm living off soy and tofu and protein powder and I'm starting to worry about the lack of variety. Is there anything other than soy that is high in protein and low in carbs? You got any low carb stories to share? EDIT: Holy shit, please calm down. I'm not talking about a Keto or Atkins diet here!

    <TITLE>Does anyone else find Earthlings contrived and worn out?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-03 02:39:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly, I think it's a terrible documentary/film and I would not show it to someone if I was trying to convince them to go vegan. First of all, the newest footage in the film is ten years old, some of the clips are over twenty years old. "Help us change yesterday's world!". It's ridiculous. Yes of course the industries are still disgusting - they're using animals, but it has changed a lot in the last ten years. The result of activism ten years ago is the boom of "free range" animal products. We know that's a joke but an omni will watch that film and think "as long as I eat free range, locally sourced (enter more buzzwords here) I can be happy in knowing my meal had a happy life before having his life humanly ended in his sleep, this film is just the worst of the worst." Do we not have a similar up to date film to spread? One that talks about what people are eating today? I thought the concept of Earthlings and using the notion that we are all species on this planet fantastic, because that's why I'm vegan and why I know a lot of you are vegan but they didn't seem to run with it or keep it a theme throughout the film. The title and idea were wasted. And it was just two hours of murder over sad music. There was no substance, no guide to get involved, it was just one big guilt trip. And the only people who can sit through a 2 hour guilt trip are the ones who have nothing to feel guilty about, or the ones who don't care at all and never will. Is that who we need spread the message to? Torture and gore don't make people stop eating animals. It's so vile that they suppress it - the same defensive mechanism you've seen countless times when you talk to someone about why you're vegan. The shock value works for only a short while before their adrenaline levels return to normal. When this was new, unseen footage it was important, back then we didn't really know what was going on or how bad it was but we do now, and we've known for ten years. The time for gore has passed, we can no longer appeal to people's hearts, we must appeal to their minds. Use logic to sway people. Hell, convince them to do it for themselves if they're that selfish. Most people will not attribute the horrible feeling they get when they watch it to the act of eating animals, as they won't be eating animals at the time. They will however, remember it as a vegan thing. Maybe this is part of the reason for our bad name, we talk about how horrible everything is rather than how good everything could be. Let's focus on the future, not the past. Edit/ Think, did anyone watch some gore and instantly go vegan? Very few I believe. What turned YOU vegan? I will always remember one simple question, "we, the human race, are advanced, intelligent and responsible enough to live healthy lives without exploiting animals, so why do we do it?" Edit 2/ Seems I was wrong! I still don't really like the film but I feel me and people around me have probably been more exposed to this kind of horror than a lot of other people as I remember thinking "this isn't new for anyone". I guess I find it hard to believe anyone could be ignorant about the price that is paid for a meal, which is ignorant of me. Although, I think we should put more effort in general into spreading a happier message, we are all about equality and love after all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice and tips on moving house with four tanks?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-07 16:32:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>We're moving from rented to rented so we're not going to have much leeway when it comes to time. Best case scenario, we have a month to move everything over, worst case is we have less than a week. I have never moved house with a fish tank before, it was in this house that we fell in love with the hobby. I just don't know where to start. We have; 160L, 70L x 2, 20l. How much water should I take out of the tanks? Where should I keep the fish while transporting and what should I provide for them? We're moving about 20-30 mins drive away. Also, I know that the place we're moving to has much softer water than we have here. Should I bring some containers of this hard water with us to help them transition especially if I'm moving the tanks with little to no water? All our plants, which we have a fair amount of, are live. How do I give them the best chance to survive the move? Should I keep my filter media wet in tank water or just tap water? Should we move one or two tanks at a time to keep the time the fish are out of their tanks to a minimum? Honestly, I really don't know how to start going about this! Oh and we have cats that need to be moved too but I don't think I'm going to move them until everything has been moved out the house and the tanks are set up in the new one. If a list of the fish we have would help here it is now; 160l (although we have "monster" fish, none of them are bigger than 20cm atm, don't worry, a new bigger tank and shift around are scheduled for when they get large) * 1 Sailfin Molly * 2 Gouramis * 3 Ellioti Chiclids * 1 Ghost Knife * 1 Eclipse Catfish * 1 Sailfin Pleco * 1 Albino Bristlenose * 1 Whiptail (who I'm considering moving to the smaller com. tank) * 1 Leopard snail 70l com. * 2 Angels * 1 young Bristlenose (possibly swapping him for the Whiptail) * 5 guppies * 4 Endlers 70l * 1 male Betta * 4 Lamp eyes 20l * 1 male Betta * 6 Ember Tetras Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Advice][Rant] How do I diplomatically tell my very sensitive friend that we don't want to live with him anymore?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-08 13:49:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>**TLDR; Have a very moody and sensitive friend, who is hard to communicate with and would probably be happier going back to his parent's, that we'd prefer not to move in to the next house with. How to approach?** The situation is that four of us live in a house together and are looking to move into a smaller house because I lost my job and we need to cut down on expenses. Even if I was working, the price of this place doesn't leave much for saving and fun. I live with my SO (S) one of my oldest friends (T) and my SO's oldest friend (J). It's J that we don't want to live with anymore, it's not just me. J doesn't contribute to housework, he is very moody and mopey and lets every one know he's in a mood. But if you ask him what's up you're talking to a brick wall. He is very hard to communicate with and this indirectly causes a lot of problems. He never leaves the house. He also has contributed naught to helping me look for another house. **Now for my lengthy rant. You don't have to read this to understand my situation. Any advice on the above is very welcome** T and I lived together in a small flat for a year and it worked fine, we got on well and split the chores and responsibilities without qualms. Half way through the tenancy I met my SO and by the end he was practically living with us. It worked so well that we decided to move in together properly and had the brainwave that if we add an extra person we could rent a lovely big house without paying too much each. And so we did. We're living in a house bigger than any of our parent's and bigger than any house I'll probably live in again. But somehow, it doesn't work here. There are some factors outside of J that I think contribute to that fact but I believe if J wasn't here, those factors wouldn't be so much of an issue. These issues are; a lack of privacy. Even though the house is big, all the entertainment (PCs, TV, Xbox, PS3, sound system) is in the communal areas. We also agreed that we would all only smoke in the conservatory. So the only thing to do in our own spaces (i.e. our own bedrooms) is read and sleep. The rest of the house is very dark and the walls of the bedrooms very thin, so any musical or artsy activities also need to take place in the conservatory. The WiFi doesn't reach my room so if I want to practice yoga I have to do it in communal areas (I'm not experienced enough to do it without a guide) which isn't entirely relaxing. You get the picture. The chores are not split evenly or fairly. We have tried various different systems that never worked out and now I basically do everything. I wouldn't have much of a problem with this if it were just my SO's mess and T's mess as they both work very hard and are quite tidy people anyway. Like I said, I lost my job. I suffer from anxiety and an array of other personality disorders which only rose once I was let go, so I'm at home all the time. My SO is an amazing person and is supporting me while I get my head straight and back into work. He also doesn't want me to get a job for the sake of getting a job, he'd rather I do something I don't hate. He also doesn't want me to get a full time job because spending time together  gt; money. I've also applied to the Open University (online education). If and when I do get a job it'll be a "from home" position or a delivery service. My point is, for the foreseeable future, I'm going to be at home a lot. J also doesn't have a job, but he never has as long as I've known him. He's been living off savings and inheritance but I believe he has run out now and is being supported by his parents. He also never leaves the house. I mean, he see's his parents once a month for a couple of hours. Remember this fact for the next few paragraphs. This is causing problems in the bedroom department with my SO and I. We **never** have the house to ourselves, and like I said, the walls are thin. Nothing organic can happen between us because when we're both horny there's always someone [J] around. If we're kissing or embracing and J sees, he makes it all feel very awkward which puts a dampener on things. If T sees he laughs and makes some joke about us being sickening, like normal people. At the end of the day the ritual is always the same, the four of us sit in the conservatory, smoking and watching netflix. S and I share a sofa but we can't snuggle because of the awkwardness PDA causes. In short, we pretty much have to plan sex. That's not sexy. He doesn't do HIS fair share of housework. I think, if you're not working, you should be cleaning more than just the mess you create. I wash up after myself and my SO and more often than not T. He takes advantage of this, knowing I don't know exactly which plate or mug or saucepan my SO used and leaves his washing up long enough for me to think "oh shit maybe this is S's" or forget who put it there in first place. As a side peeve, all the cutlery and cook-wear and crockery (and most of the furniture in the house) is mine or mine and S's and it's not looked after to the standard I would look after my own stuff. His idea of taking out the bins is wheeling the outside bins to the front of the house. The kitchen bin, waste paper baskets and bathroom bin are always still full when he's finished. Recycling falls on my and S's bin days so he doesn't even have to do that. We made a rule that we take it in turns to clean the bathroom, but there wasn't a time limit, just when it needed it. When it was his turn he didn't clean the bathroom for **four months**. It was disgusting. But balls was I doing it, I'd already done it twice when it wasn't my turn. He hasn't helped a single bit when it comes to moving house. The other lads I can let off because T works 8-5 with an hour commute each way and shows enthusiasm when I talk to him about it. S is self employed and works hard and is supporting me! But S helps, he sits with me and looks through houses and rings the estate agents for me if I'm feeling particularly anxious. You know, there's a bunch of other things too but this is so bloody long and boring and he just sat down at his pc and I feel awkward typing about him when he's in the same room.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice on upgrading to a larger tank without extra electronics?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-25 17:31:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! I've acquired a 70l (15g) tank and I've decided to move Esteban, my first betta, into it from his 20l tank. He lives with 5 ember tetras and 2 pigmy salt and pepper corys. When I bought it, I thought it would be big enough but it's really not and I've been looking at it for a while with sorrow and regret, don't hate me, I already feel terribly guilty. I only have an extra tank and I bought some fresh substrate and sand today, but no extra heater or filter. So, my question is, what's the best way to transfer Esteban and his friends to the larger tank? There's no point in "cycling" the tank without a filter, and the filter I have has pretty mature media in it. Can I just set up the new tank as I would normally, add the plants, rocks and filter from his current tank without cleaning them and top it up with all the water in his tank? What about the temperature? Is it a good idea to float him and his friends in another tank while I wait for the new tank to warm up? It'll be equivalent to an 80% water change so it'd be pretty cold in there. If none of this is a good idea, what can I do? Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I want to get into pet play but I fear it may be too weird because of how much we love our actual pets.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-27 19:25:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Me and my SO have a typical female sub, male dom sex life with me being the female (not 24/7). We have three cats whom we love to the moon and back but we're not the "furry babies" kind of people, it's more "furry friends whom we feed". By that I mean they are very much our pets. I can imagine it would be easier to separate the ideas in my head if we saw them as our furry children. We've never spoken about it in the terms of calling it "pet play" but we've floated around ideas of having him lead me around on a leash (his idea) and me sitting at his feet while we watch TV (my idea). A while ago he started stroking my hair while I give him head out of the blue. At first I found it weird and uncomfortable because it's exactly the same way we stroke our cats when they're relaxed but like a good sub I sucked it up because he clearly liked it and eventually I've come to somewhat enjoy it, if not just because he does. Before we even got together, I wanted one of those fluffy tail butt plugs and fantastised about being told to wiggly my ass with it in. I don't know if I'd be into barking/meowing but I already have my own human form of purring that he loves. (for those intruiged it doesn't by any means resemble the sound of purring, it's just the "mmms" you make when you're doing lovely things like cuddling instead of the "mmms" you make when you're getting dirty) So my point is that it seems both parties are interested in some form of it. However, I think that I'd find it rather weird if we really got into it, just like I did with the hair stroking. Human's do stroke each other so it wasn't hard to get over but if we start doing things that are exclusively pet/owner activities I think it might remind me too much of our cats! I think if we got more into it, it'd be integrated into our regular play rather than having sessions devoted to pet play. I'd like to hear from some people who are into pet play who do have pets and how you separate the two mentally? And just some of your experiences with it, what you do that you consider pet play, some ideas past the ones I've already described and anything you want to say about pet play! **tldr:** people into pet play who have pets, tell me about your experiences!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-06-19 16:42:01</DATE>
    <TEXT> gt; Tank info: (I just did a quick JBL dip test so not as accurate as an API tube test and no ammonia test)  gt;  gt; * Nitrates, 10  gt; * Nitrites, 0  gt; * pH, 7.2  gt; * GH,  gt;7  gt; * Temp, 26c  gt;  gt; 70L tropical freshwater tank with Superfish aqua-flow 200 filter. Tetra "complete substrate" with white sand on top as a base. Live plants including water lettuce, high aeration/surface movement. The tank, in it's current state, has been set up for 2 months. The tank used to have a massive algae problem but when I moved house (2 months ago) I completely emptied it and scrubbed it clean, including re homing the fish in there and basically starting again. The only thing that is the same is the heater, filter and air pump. Used the old filter media to kick start the cycle.  gt;  gt; 1 CT Betta, 2 pigmy corys, 6 blue tetras, 2 celebes rainbowfish and 5 silver hatchets. 4 of the hatchets were the last to be added to the tank and they're the ones with white spot. It seems to now be spreading to one of my celebes' too and they were added to the tank second to last. I recently lost one of the celebes' but not to white spot, she was swimming vertically for about a week before she died, I don't know what killed her, everyone else is swimming fine and eating, nothing seems to be wrong except for the white spot. I've been using NTLabs anti-white spot and fungus treatment for a week and a half now (one dose every two days) but it doesn't seem to be disappearing, if anything it's spreading. The original hatchet, whom I've had for a while, is schooling with the new ones but isn't showing signs of white spot. Also, the smallest of the new arrivals is schooling too but isn't showing any signs. The original hatchet is also the smallest of them all. So my three largest new hatchets are suffering, I mean. Hatchets occupy the top of the tank and eat from the surface and I recently put in one of those underwater LED bubble walls, which creates more movement on the surface of the water than just the small air diffuser I was using before. However, they had white spot before I purchased this. Perhaps this is stressing them out and stopping them from healing? Like I said, it looks like one of my celebes is catching it but it's not on his fins, it's just a few spots on his body and it could easily be my sand (which is very fine and very white and looks like white spot when it lands on the fish, sometimes it gets caught in the airflow and makes it look like my tank is snowing so it's not hard to believe it would fall on the fish) I usually use liquid co2 3 times a week and complete plant food once a week, but since I've been treating the white spot the only other chemical I'm using is tap safe. Unfortunately, I do not have a hospital/quarantine tank. Should I up the dosage? Or treat every day? Should I try a different brand? (this brand has worked for me in the past in other tanks) Does medicine go off once opened? Is there something that looks exactly like white spot but isn't? I'm at a loss, and I love my little hatches :( god forbid it spreads to my Betta. Thank you in advance.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wondering about water changes and temperature drops, never seen it addressed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-30 11:03:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Title is trash, sorry. So, whenever you bring a new fish home we're taught to acclimatise them. Half this process is to have the water in the bag slowly come to the same temperature as the tank, which makes me think that rapid temp changes are harmful. But, when we do water changes we don't warm the new water up first. Sometimes, depending on how big the water change, my temp can drop up to 8 degrees and it doesn't seem to affect the fish at all, in fact some of them play in the temporary waterfall of fresh, cold water being poured in. Have I missed something big? Should I be trying to warm the new water up somehow? Maybe one kettle of boiled water per 20l bucket? Or have I misunderstood the acclimatising process and it's just to get them used to the water quality/hardness?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Regarding Helena's mortality (Spoilers all)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-03 17:32:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all, let me just say how much I love Helena. I don't think I've ever fangirl'd so much over a TV character but she is just amazing. From her hair to her accent to her murdering abilities, I just fucking love her. Anyway. After Sarah shot her and she survived I was convinced that she had some super powers, like wolverine, super fast healing. I know the proletheans picked her up and looked after her, both times Sarah wounded her but she's either really fucking lucky or something else is going on. I'm not even going to pretend to understand the science but maybe the same thing that makes the twins fertile makes them almost indestructible? Sarah has been in a few alterations she probably shouldn't have survived too. And with Sarah looking worse for wear with no hope in sight at the end of this season it would be a really good time for the reveal. I'm probably way off base but that would be a cool twist. Especially since Kira seems to be developing some super-natural abilities. The immortal twins, anyone?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dreaming of myself being very violent to innocent people.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-22 10:44:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not a violent person, I'm not even an angry person. I've been in two fights in my life and they were both fights with my sister (I mean, we'd fight when we were kids but these were when we were teenagers and she started both of them) Over the past week I've had four dreams where I've been maliciously violent to someone very close to me or a stranger. I can't remember the details because they're really uncomfortable to think about so I let them fade away in the morning haze but I know they all share these aspects: * I'm dominant in them, the other person is either doing nothing or trying to shield themselves, it's not a fight. * The victim is innocent of anything heinous, if anything set me off it's small things like not doing the dishes. * There's no weapons, it's just me. * It's hyper violent, it's not just punching and kicking, the damage done could only be done with weapons but somehow I'm doing it with my hands and teeth. I'm a fan of horror and gore so my brain has a lot to draw from. I don't wake up feeling guilty but I do feel very disturbed. I have no desire in waking life to hurt anyone, except myself (I'm a long time self harmer if that means anything). I'm going through a very anxious and depressive stage in my life where I can barely leave my house, maybe this is causing frustration? But why would that manifest its self as violence to innocent people? I really don't enjoy having these dreams. I used to use my dreams to escape but the last year or so they've been turning sour. :(</TEXT>

Personally, I'm #teamdetox and have been since her season, I love that bitch even if she thinks reddit is one person and doesn't like us but I'd be happy to see any of them win. She should have sent Roxxxy home, yeah, but she's known her for 16 years, it wasn't an easy choice. And Alaska's tantrum was disgraceful but she's a drag queen! If there was no diva in her would she have gotten this far?! And it wasn't all that bad, she was only disappointed in herself, she wasn't blaming anyone else. I don't need to say anything about Katya cause she can do no wrong in most of our eyes but I didn't want to leave her out of this post so this is my shout out to the insane commie  lt;3 I wish Rolaskatox wasn't a thing but remember that it's Rolaskatox that killed drag, not Alaska and Detox!

    <TITLE>Just finished Roanoke - few questions about Lee and the witch (spoilers throughout)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-04 14:56:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay so let me ask about Lee first. 1) Why did she go back? Shell went back because it was the only place she could be in the same room as Matt and she wanted desperately to be back with him. Matt went back because he was in love with the witch. The actors went back for money and didn't believe the stories. Flora was safe and isn't that all she cared about? 2) Did she really kill her ex-husband? When she "kidnapped" Flora she described it like she didn't know what happened between the school and the house and I took that as Priscilla somehow tapping into the universe and bringing Flora back to her. She could have killed him with a rock, but then why was he found all burnt and hung up? I saw the confession as a way to connect with the young Poke she manipulated. This is like textbook manipulation, getting someone to do you a favour (record her confession) makes people like you more and admitting to something akin to what the Pokes get up to creates empathy and understanding. 3) What happened between her and the witch? She ate a fetal pig and then seemed possessed when she went back into the house. But then she "snapped out of it" when the police showed up? This bit really didn't make any sense to me. Why would the witch leave her alive? Why does the witch even care if people live in the house? Why wouldn't she still be possessed afterwards? Which leads me on to my last questions. What's the deal with the witch? Seriously what does she want? I understand how she got there but I don't understand anything else. How did she become immortal? What benefit did the Butcher and her colony bring her? Why was she obsessed with Matt? Anything you could tell me about the witch would help. Oh and one more thing, how come none of the present characters that died in or around the house come back as spirits (except Lee at the end)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm interested on other people's processes and what you've come up with. Of course, not everyone names their fish. We don't name every single tetra or cory but the larger, distinguishable ones get names! We seem to name most of ours after characters in whatever series we're watching when we get them. We've got; Ramsey, Pearl, Dexter, Crixus, Jim, Glen, Graham and Willis all named of TV, then; Percy, Brutus, Flo, Rupert, Henry and Esteban plucked out of our minds. I'm particularly proud of Ramsey. He's a black ghost *knife* fish and I was watching Game of Thrones and a lot of Hell's Kitchen at the time (get it, huh huh? Ramsey Bolton, *flayed* men. Gordon Ramsey, chef, chefs use a lot of *knives*).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there a way to edit duplicate groups simultaneously?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-15 11:36:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>All on one image. I'm creating product labels and to save printing money my client wants the design duplicated as many times as will fit on the height of the printing paper. (I know I could just send him the one design and have his printer align them but this is what he's asked for) I have 4 designs for one height. So each different label is the same design but with some information changed (high, quantity etc) and currently I'm editing one design then grouping the whole thing, duplicating it 3 times and re-positioning them in line. I wondered if there's a way to leave the duplicate groups and have them change automatically when I change the original group, because, even with snap, re-positioning them is becoming tedious and not very precise.

    <TITLE>HAE gone through stages of being a extrovert in their lives?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-19 13:39:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I was a little girl I was quite outgoing, then when I started big school (11y/o+) I stopped playing outside and spend most of my free time inside on the pc, bar a few close friends that might come over after school. Then when I hit drinking age (18 for the UK) I went a bit mental. Ofc I'd been drinking before this but now I was allowed into bars and clubs. I dyed my hair all kinds of crazy colours, wouldn't come home for days, had a thousand friends and acquaintances, dressed in eye catching styles, had one night stands, squatted in different cities, raves, hitch hiking around Europe etc. Then around 22/23 I calmed down again and now at 25 I'm dealing with major agoraphobia. I've always felt like an introvert because even when I was outgoing I still kept my business to myself or a few close people and needed my alone time to rejuvenate. Maybe it comes in waves, like someone with manic depression, but just on a much larger time scale. Anyone else experience something like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, One of (three of) my galaxy rasboras looks like his scales are puffing out. He's also constantly opening and closing his mouth. I've read up on dropsy and he has no other symptoms, he's just as wide as his counterparts (no bloating), is eating, swimming and pooping fine. It started to happen *after* a water change. However, I did rehome five glass catfish into his tank a few days before the symptoms started. He lives in a 75l tank with a variety of small tetras, said glass catfish and one male betta. I'm going to treat the whole tank tonight with NTlabs anti-white spot and fungus as one of the other danios is now constantly opening and closing his mouth too but has no scales flaking away from him. Really, what I'm asking is, is he in pain and should I put him down? Or shall I see it through?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having bad dreams that are affecting my waking life.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-17 18:04:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bit of information: My SO and I have been together coming up to three years and lived together for a year and a half, before him I was in an on and off relationship for 7 years with my "first love" with a few smaller relationships in between the breaks of said relationship. There's only one notable fling during that time, and I call it a fling because I knew I couldn't trust him and it was only meant to be a bit of fun but we definitely touched each other's hearts before we broke it off. All three are very different lads, first love is a BASE jumping, world traveling, dreadlock wearing adventurer, fling is a weed dealing football (soccer) hooligan socialite and my SO is a hard working, ex-awkward/nerdy teenager who blossomed into a very handsome and all round good guy but never realised his greatness. I'm telling you this because all three are frequent visitors in my dreams, sort of. I wouldn't say I have trust issues, even though I probably should, if anything I trust too quickly and forgive too easily. My dreams are laden with my SO cheating on me, and when confronted about it, he is often heartless and emotionless. Last night's dream he had been cheating on me for a long time and it was with a friend (not a real life friend, just a faceless girl in my dream who had the essence of friends) and told me he was in love with her. This is new in the dream, it's usually just one night stands. And it was bad, I kept waking up in the dream and hoping it was a dream only to find out it was real, it was really soul destroying. Back to the other two lads, you know how dreams are weird and people and things merge? Often my SO in the dream takes the face, feeling and relationship status of my SO but has essences of the other two. Like all three of them are cheating on me. I know that fling cheated on me but that never hurt because I expected it, and I suspect first love cheated on me as that was a very messy teenage relationship. But SO is the only man I've ever been with or even met that I've wanted to marry and have children with. I know that I trust him with all my heart and it's very easy to push the paranoia away. There's not even a tiny reason not to trust him, I know all his passwords, apart from when he's at work we're always together, he's working hard for our future and he reminds me every day with words and actions how much he loves me. But I want these dreams to stop. It's making me very depressed when I wake up, I spent half an hour crying in my SO's arms when he came back from work and I've had two of them this week. It's draining me and I can only imagine it's frustrating my SO, if he was having such frequent dreams I would start questioning if he truly trusted me. I often go to sleep imagining fantasy worlds, telling myself stories of fairies and dragons, this is my way of shutting my day brain off, so why aren't my dreams filled with them? Why the complete opposite? Does anyone know of anyway (bar lucidity - I've tried that and I just can't grasp it) to affect my dreams somehow?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My cat is constantly re-opening a wound and I need some advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-05 18:39:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yoyo is a 3 year old 4kg black male moggy. Snipped and vaxed. I'm in the UK and he has no history of illnesses or bad accidents. He often gets in scrapes with thorn bushes and other cats and always comes home with a new scab and this one was no different, except it was in the middle of his shoulder blades. It started out as a tiny scab and I was not worried about it but, perhaps this one particularly irritated him or is in an awkward place and he kept catching it on the catflap. It is now at the point where it is an *inch* in diameter and there's seemingly nothing I can do to let it heal in peace. It doesn't look or smell infected fyi. A month ago I bought a soft cone online and kept him inside for about a week to let it heal. One morning I was feeling particularly sorry for him and the wound looked much better than it had so I took his cone off and let him free, alas, he came back and the scab had been ripped off again. I've put the cone back on and kept him inside again but he managed to re-open it again with the cone on. I never see him trying to lick it or scratch it, he always re-opens it when I'm not around. The problem is that I live in a very small ground floor maisonette and my cats are used to 100% freedom of coming and going and Yoyo is particularly an outside cat. He is chewing/cleaning his paws vigorously and this behaviour is worrying me, he's also "playing" a bit too hard with my youngest cat - I think he's very stressed and frustrated. It's also becoming a problem for my other cats because they are confined to the one room with the cat flap in it and one of my cats is clearly feeling abandoned/exiled as she's usually always next to me. I've run out of feliway and am skint at the moment but should be getting some money today or tomorrow and that will be my first purchase to hopefully soothe him a bit. I can't put a bandage on him due to it's location and I don't see what a vet can do other than advise me to keep him inside and wear a cone. He's not in pain, it's not infected, he just needs to let it heal! Any ideas or suggestions you have to quicken the healing process, calm him or anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me name my blind gerbils!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-07 15:29:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Later today, I'm adopting three blind gerbils but I don't know what to call them! I'm a big fan of puns and I hate none human names for my animals. My cats are called Keiko, Yoru and Taiyo (Japanese names/words) My fish are called: Esteban, Jeremiah, Percy, Ramsey, Dexter, Jim, Pearl, Flo and Brutus. My hamster is called Desmond. Some of my pets are named from TV shows, Jim used to be Jim and Pam, Ramsey is named of Ramsey Snow/Gordon Ramsey (he's a black ghost *knife* fish, get it?) Dexter obviously from Dexter, and Pearl from Drag Race. I was thinking of Charlie, Mac and Dennis because I love Always Sunny but I didn't immediately think "yes!" so I'm still undecided. Let's get creative /r/namenerds :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm potentially taking on a new cat and she has a terrible attitude. I need a cat psychologist!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-12 15:24:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>*I'm cross-posting this to as many subs as I can think of to source as many ideas as I can so I apologise if you've read this before and I'm being annoying.* Long story short, my neighbour is potentially going to jail. Last night he came round and asked me if he did go down, would I look after his cat? If he gets found guilty, he'll be gone for at least 5 years so this cat will essentially be mine. He has court early this morning and said he would ring me in the afternoon. It's 4:15 pm and I've had no phone call and his car hasn't come back so I'm starting to fear the worst. Quick info: She's a black  amp; white un-neutered and un-vaxed moggy, about a year old (14 months). Even though she's caused nothing but problems for me and two of my cats, I said yes without thinking. I rent so I don't have a cat flap, I leave my window open. Ever since she started going outside, she's been coming into my house and even though I've done everything in my power to accommodate her, she's just a bitch. Okay, so you don't know me but I am a huge cat/animal lover and normally I understand that what ever "behavioural issues" an animal has, there's a rational reason for it and with love and patience they can be overcome. I would detest someone for calling a cat a bitch, there are no horrible animals but Bella has been given all the love and patience I have (a whole year of it) and still treats me and my SO like we're about to murder her. She is comfortable in my house, she knows every nook and cranny, she happily sits on the floor/fish tank/under the bed and cleans herself. She gently takes treats out of my hands and uses our cat fountain and sometimes polishes off any food my cats may have left. I have three cats, my youngest cat and Bella are actually really good friends. I know this won't last, it's just because they're both young and playful but she follows him around and they hang out together and play, IE he more than tolerates her, he enjoys her company. The problems arise when I try to interact with her. If you get too close to her (without a treat) she hisses and spits and growls and swipes like the devil is after her. The same if you try to stroke her. I've tried giving her a treat with one hand and stroking her with the other, I've done all the letting her smell my hand stuff, I know that cats interpret looking into their eyes as aggression, I've lay flat on the floor, I've ignored her, I've done everything a life time of love for and ownership of cats has taught me. I have no official training but honestly, I probably know more about cats than I do anything else and I look after my cats better than I look after myself. My neighbour told me that he's the only person she let's touch her and she loves him. Watching the way he interacts with my cats and Bella, I have no reason not to believe this or think that he treats her badly. He also told me that when he bought her (at 7 weeks old -.-) she was in a house with a German Shepard guard dog that had lunged at her a few times (that's why the first owners gave her away). Maybe this is part of the reason for her behaviour but my house is a dog free zone and I very rarely interact with dogs so that smell is never present around me. I'm at a loss as to how to comfort her more. I have a very cat friendly house, with felliway and toys and water fountains. They are allowed on every surface in the house except one fish tank, where I feed my eldest because she's a nibbler and likes to come back to her food so I keep it safe for her. Cats gravitate towards me, I've been in houses where visitors get warned "mind the cat, she only likes me" and then had that same cat climb all over me and purr in my lap. Very recently, as in the last week, I started to use a water spray bottle on her when she comes in my house, because she is not friendly with my other two cats. I am currently housing two of my friend's cats because he was made homeless, and one of my cats is in a cone and house bound. This has put a lot of stress on my eldest cat who is usually stuck to my side. She's been coming home less and less and it's very upsetting. I'm 99% sure it's because she feels her house is invaded (I don't have a big house) and being as I can't do anything about my friend's cats or my cone cat, I thought I could deter Bella from coming in. I'd given up on being friends with her, which is something I never thought I'd do, so this probably hasn't helped matters. Although, I used to use the water bottle on my youngest cat because he was a food fiend when he was a kitten and he's the friendliest cat I know. If my neighbour rings me and tells me he's been put away, I'm going to ask him for money for vets bills to get her spayed, vaxed and micro-chipped. The last time I had a female spayed was 7 years ago so I forget if spaying them changes their temperament? Maybe this would help? "Why are you deciding to keep her?" I hear you ask. For a number of reasons, the main one being I'm a big softy and it's not Bella's fault her human got locked up. The only other living thing she gains comfort off, apart from my neighbour, is my youngest cat. She knows my house and this area and I'm worried that if she went to a shelter she'd never be adopted because of her temperament. No-one I know has room in their life for another cat and I don't think my neighbour keeps the best company so who knows where she'd end up or how she'd be treated. This post is already super long so I'm going to stop now but if you have any questions that will help you help me, please ask! And thank you so much for reading this far.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hans Christian Andersen - The Snow Queen [Discussion]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-19 01:28:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>After the first few episodes, I saw a couple of threads mentioning the similarities between Cult and The Snow Queen and they didn't get enough traction. Edit: I found the old posts [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/6yhlja/spoilers_connection_between_cult_and_a_fairy_tale/)  amp; [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/6ymdz0/kai_and_winters_names_my_theory_i_guess_everyone/) I feel that the similarities are still running today and I've been really excited about how it's going to pan out but I never see anyone discussing it here. So [here's the link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow_Queen) to the wiki if you want to read the plot but I will try and summarise it here also. ---- It follows the story of a pair of childhood friends, Kai and Gerda who play in their adjoining rooftop gardens full of roses. The devil has a mirror that reflects only the worst in people and things, distorting everything and making it ugly. He takes it around the world, relishing in bringing pain and dirt to everyone. One day, he decides to take it up to heaven but as he and his troll students got higher and higher, the mirror shook more violently, until it flew out their hands and smashed back down to earth. It shattered into pieces as small as grains of sand, swept on the winds across the earth and got into people's hearts and eyes. This caused their hearts and eyes to effectively become devil's mirrors themselves and they could only see and feel the hate and anger. One summer, a shard got into Kai and he started to be really mean to sweet Gurda. The following winter, he ended up being charmed and whisked away by The Snow Queen, because her Snow Bees were the only thing that looked beautiful to him. The village concluded that Kai had fallen into the frozen lake and died but Gurda never accepted it and went on a journey to find him. In her travels, she meets an old sorceress who wants Gurda to stay with her, so she charms her to forget about her quest and Kai. The sorceress makes all the roses in her garden sink underground but forgets a rose on her hat. One day Gurda notices it and a tear falls to the ground, revealing all the roses and they tell her Kai isn't dead so she moves on. She meets a bunch more people who are more helpful in pointing her to The Snow Queen's palace and gets told along the way that "She cannot receive any power from me greater than she now has, which consists in her own purity and innocence of heart." Gurda finds Kai in the palace on a frozen lake dubbed "The Mirror of Reason" where he has been tasked by the Snow Queen to spell out a word with ice shards, if he does she will set him free (and give him a pair of skates?) Gurda hugs him and cries tears of love on Kai which melt his heart and causes him to cry and dislodge the shard in his eye. They dance around with joy causing the ice shards to fly around and spell out the word the Snow Queen had set, "eternity", and they're free and go home. It ends with their grandma reading a passage from the bible:  gt;Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the Kingdom of Heaven ---- There are the obvious similarities are the names. The sibling's family being named after the author, Hand Christian *Andersen*. The Snow Queen is only active in *winter*. Then there's the rose symbolism that we first see in the very opening few seconds of the season and again later on the parent's bedroom door. Kai's campaign has been based on fear which I strongly believe represents the devil's mirror. Now here are some of my own theroys. At first I thought, because of her name, that Winter was a catalyst for the events that happen to Kai and that Ally was going to be Gurda, saving Kai from his fear and whomever was going to become The Snow Queen, but now I think it'll be Winter who saves Kai (or at least tries to - it is AHS afterall, not a fairy tale). I also think that Bebe might be The Snow Queen. Or maybe the devil, but I love the idea of Frances being an evil snow queen so I'm sticking with that. She's the one pulling the strings and holding Kai captive. I know this doesn't have anything to do with Ivy and Ally, the others or cults in general but I think there's too many coincidences for it to be an accident. Perhaps it's just contained to Kai and Winter's back story, which could mean that Bebe is their grandmother. It's probably best if you read the wiki summery because it's alot more detailed and I think there'll be more links - I've only summarised the plot points I thought significant. Edit: I just remebered another glaring clue; Kai says "I am a mirror"! I squealed irl when he said it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A few bugs/issues I've found with Cats  amp; Dogs so far</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-21 18:30:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love Cats  amp; Dogs, I think they've done a really good job of it, specifically the paint tool and the pet traits, the way the pets behave is very realistic and it's obvious animals lovers were heavily involved with making this. However, even after the hot fix patch, there's still some issues I keep coming across: * "Bubblegum wants a clean litter tray" even though I'm using the self cleaning litter tray. It happens about once a sim week and the only way to rectify it is to buy a new litter tray as there's no option to clean it. * "Cici needs to go potty" even though she's already learnt to go by herself and sometimes still does. Does she just forget sometimes? * Can't leash more than one dog at a time, and can't take more than one dog on a walk! Even the short walks or jogs take up a lot of time so not being able to take all your dogs at once is very time consuming, unrealistic and inconvenient. * No options for pet activities in clubs! You can make the cat/dog lovers traits a requirement but that's where it stops. The first thing I wanted to do after making my pets and decorating my house with new items was make an animal lovers club! Alas, no such joy. * I've had my vet clinic open for 7,801 hours (although it says -7,801?) with one employee who apparently never gets tired, or has any needs whatsoever. * Even though I've already released her spirit to the netherworld (twice), my first pet keeps coming back as a ghost. This may be my fault though because I added her back to the household as a ghost (before releasing her), and then transferred her to a household I don't play. However, I've had the notification "Doki's spirit is fading away" and I feel, even if she's in a another household as a ghost, she shouldn't be tied down to the lot she died in, once her spirit has been released. * In real life, playing with laser pointers with your cats, especially kittens, is a massive no no. It can *literally* drive cats insane or cause mental/emotional/development problems. The reason behind this is because their hunting instinct is triggered but never satisfied, as they can't catch light! There are ways to safely play with lasers with your cats but these options aren't available in game and it's better just to stick to cat wands and toys they can catch to avoid any problems. I've got issues with this because The Sims is played by all ages, it's very influential and it's teaching the future generation of pet owners a very bad habit. Perhaps, instead of taking lasers out of the game, EA could add a negative moodlet if you play with them too often. "Bubblegum is very stressed from never being able to catch a laser, try playing with a cat wand to satisfy their hunting instinct" Edit: Back to the cat litter issue. It's still persisting. I never have the option to clean the self cleaning ones no matter how much my cat is upset about it. This time, even selling and buying new ones didn't work, even trying different models of self cleaning. Tried debugging my cat and the litter trays. It only fixed when I bought the cheapest one. Another issue has popped up too. I adopted a kitten and she jumped onto the cat tree and couldn't get down. She was hungry, even though the bowls were full so I called her to eat but she didn't jump down. Emptied the bowl and refilled it and called her. I tried to pick her up, my sim walked over to her but just ended up staring at her while the action was still active with nothing happening. I ended up having to put every empty surface in my house in my inventory (because when I moved the cat tree she transported to on top of the fridge... and then the counter)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need some help deciding on a toner.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-21 21:20:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR: What toner should I use to get from [this](https://i.imgur.com/A22JS9R.jpg) to [this](https://i.imgur.com/SLx8ure.jpg) --------- Hello /r/hair! I'm aiming for [this colour](https://i.imgur.com/SLx8ure.jpg) which is a sample for Crazy Colour Marshmallow that I've already bought. I'll try and run down my hair history really quick. I've straightened my hair once in the last three years and haven't used a hair dryer in about 4 years. I dyed my hair red using XXL Live about two years ago and haven't fully dyed it since, I believe most of this has grown out. Four months ago I bleached the lower part of my hair, using 40% BBlonde peroxide and used [Live lightener and twist cool rose](https://www.livecolour.com/our-products/lightener-twist/101-cool-rose) on top. The bleach took out anything that was left of the red but the lightener only looked pink when it was wet and only for a few washes so that's completely gone. [This](https://i.imgur.com/A22JS9R.jpg) is what my bleached hair currently looks like. The top and the roots are dark brown and completely untouched. As you can see, it's quite yellow. In that picture you can see a strip test I did of the Marshmallow Crazy Colour (right next to my neck) because when I opened the bottle it looked more purple than I wanted but I'm happy with the colour, I just want it less yellow. I plan to bleach the rest of my hair using 40% BBlonde, using a toner over everything and the covering with Marshmallow. Obviously, I don't want to re-bleach my hair to get out more of the yellow because I know I'm playing with fire using 40% and I've spent many a year growing out my awfully damaged hair from past bad practices. And you can tell the strip test is much dryer than the rest. I've been advised to use Wella Professional toner but I'm not sure what colour or strength would give me the results I want. I would rather lean more towards pink, white or silver tones than blue, orange or purple tones. Thank you in advance for any help or information! God, I'm awful at keeping things short.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How can I tell if my degu has mites or parasites?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-11 15:48:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey /r/degus! At the beginning of the year I rescued a solitary degu who had to be separated from her hutch mates because of bullying. Before I adopted her, she had the all clear from a vet, however, a few days before I took her home, some very ill rats with mites and various other problems moved into the display cage next to her. It's probably unlikely because her air vent was at the back of her cage and the rats were to the side of her but still a possibility. So everywhere says that "if your degu is scratching more than normal and/or has bits of fur missing they may have parasites." Now, she has no fur missing but I don't know what "more than normal" would be! I've never had a degu before so I don't know if I'm being paranoid (I mean, everyone scratches right?) or if I should get her to a vet! She seems happy and healthy otherwise, she gets a sand bath everyday, eats her food, runs on her wheel, pooing and weeing fine and interacting with me happily. So, how do I know what "excessive scratching" would be? [Here's a picture of my lovely Petal :)](https://i.imgur.com/aMXE9ru.jpg)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Repairing bleached hair - requesting help and advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-02 16:45:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Curly Hair! I've spent the last few days making my way through the links in the sidebar and, maybe I've missed it but I can't seem to find anything about fixing bleached hair specifically (or maybe I was just overwhelmed with the volume of information!) A bit about my hair journey/routine: I've spent the last couple of years growing out awful box dye and during this time I've used heat on my hair once - I don't own straighteners, curlers or a hair dryer! I seldom wash my hair, I don't leave the house much so I have the luxury of letting my hair get as greasy and oily as it can, my hair gets washed anywhere between a week apart to a month apart. When I do wash my hair I use Aussie Miracle Moist shampoo and cond, concentrating the cond on my ends and body and avoiding my roots. I will stop using these sulphate happy products as soon as I've found a CG friendly cleanser! I use no other products on my hair. I've recently bought satin pillow cases which is doing wonders for the frizz that's plagued me for years. I never use hair ties/bobbles, if I want to wear my hair up I use bobby pins. So I got bored of brown and bleached my hair, twice (it's thick! It needed to be done twice!) but I only used vegetable based toners and colours - no more box dye for me. It's not even the colour I want but that's another issue. The first time I did it, it came out curly and soft so I thought my hair could take a bit more, I used a weaker peroxide the second time just in case but it destroyed my hair, especially the ends. My next steps are: trimming as much of the damaged ends as I can without crying about lost length, not washing it for as long as is humanly possible, deep cleansing, repair, stock up on CG products, get it the god damn colour I want (vegetable semi permanents only)! Now you know my life story, can you help? I'm so pissed off with myself, I should have just stopped at the first bleach and used a slightly darker shade of the colour I wanted (but pastel hair is so pretty T_T) You don't have to take me through the CG routine - loads of reading material on that! Just some product recommendations or links to pages I've missed or just tell me what you did to fix your bleached hair! EDIT: My curl type is 3a/3b TLDR; bleached my relatively healthy hair, need some guidance repairing it. Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's your favourite kind of rope?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-06 15:56:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>We bought hemp rope under some recommendation (I can't remember why) but I'm not happy with it. We've had it for a while but we probably only use it  lt;10% of the time and it's fraying and weakening in places. It's also really scratchy on my skin, which is fine once we're in the swing of things as there's more on my mind but it really turns me off during the set up - I'm more focused on how uncomfortable I am than the fact I'm getting bound. We've only got one rope, it's very long so it can accommodate a lot of ties but obviously also limits a lot of things we can do so we're looking at getting some more, but I don't think I want another hemp rope. So! What's your favourite and why? Maybe particular brands as well? Maybe we've just got a low quality one!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello guys! I'm brand new, to this sub and to sewing (well, I used to sew with my Nan as a kid but that was more than 15 years ago) so please forgive any faux pas! The machine I have a question about is a Brother SuperGalaxie 895 (it's old but it's all I have). The top thread keeps snapping and it's very frustrating. I can go for a couple of inches, sometimes three whole inches! but it always snaps eventually and I feel I'm spending my time re-threading the machine instead of sewing. I've done all the trouble shooting that the manual suggests and no joy. Some things I've done to try and combat this: * Stopped using low quality tread * Changed the needle to a fresh, new one * Wind fresh bobbins * Played around with the tension * Played around with the stitch length * Tried different sewing speeds * Cleared dust out the machine * Tried metal and plastic bobbins I'm only using normal cotton fabric, nothing fancy ([exactly this fabric](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01J5EZ2ZE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1)). I'm using the needle it came with but as it's secondhand, I don't know if this is the right needle, however, the lady it came from is an experienced sewer so I doubt she'd use the wrong needle. Anyway, changing the needle to brand new ones didn't help. I'm almost definitely threading it right, I've studied and studied this to make sure it's not human error. I even took the machine to my Nan's for her to help me out and she confirmed I was threading it correctly. I'm using a spool stop larger than my spool. It happens in every scenario, whether I have pins in the fabric or not, going fast or slow, any sized stitch, backwards and forwards, straight stitch, zig zag etc Please help, I'm out of ideas and I just want to sew T_T</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have some super beginner questions, mainly about pins. ~~Why would you choose to use round head pins over flat head pins?~~ ~~What are the pros and cons of clips instead of pins?~~ ~~Am I meant to take the pins out when they get close to the needle and foot or can you sew over them?~~ ~~My machine was a hand me down and came with no accessories except one foot and one needle so I'm looking to replenish. I can find kits of feet online that say they're for my machine but they're pretty cheap. Specifically I want a zipper foot, a walking foot, an embroidery foot and a hem foot but a full set would be helpful. Should I be looking for genuine brands or are feet generally pretty cheap?~~ I have a Brother Supergalaxie 895 sewing and embroidery machine. I think it's the first computer machine they did and I'm super confused about the memory card! Do I have to buy memory cards with pre-loaded patterns on it (they seem very expensive for ~30 patterns) or is there a way or a product I can buy that lets me load patterns I've downloaded from my pc to the memory card? It doesn't have your standard modern SD card slot or USB slot, it's a very big slot for the card! More embroidery questions, do I have to find an embroidery plate that was made for my machine or are they pretty universal? What are you favourite sewing websites? Blogs, e-commerce, tips and tricks, patterns, but mainly I'm looking for reasonably priced, quality fabric and thread selling sites that ship to the UK. A bonus fun question, what one item did you buy and after using it think "how did I ever sew without this?!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much! This was very helpful and informative. So, glass head pins for ironing with the pins in. Clips for things you don't want holes in and thick edges, flat heads for almost everything else. Is there any scenario where plastic round head pins are best, or is it just because they're cheap and readily available? This is all I have at the moment, although I've ordered some flat heads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know how you can fix this but I think you should talk to your daughter about what she wants before taking it apart. I'm a 27 y/o with a security blanket, that I've had since the day I was born, and some of these suggestions horrified me. My blanket has tassels round the edge so I wouldn't want it made into the centre of a new blanket. I like to scrunch it up under my chin while it's wrapped around my hand so a pillow wouldn't work. Too much new fabric would make it feel like a different blanket. This is just me, she will have different reasons why she likes her quilt so I strongly believe you should find out what she feels is the "essence" of her quilt before figuring out how to fix it. She might not be as attached to certain aspects as me and just wants to keep it alive for sentimental purposes, in that case, re-purposing it and giving it a new life would be a wonderful idea, but you know, just check first :).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it's American *Horror Story* and it uses all the tropes and stereotypes we're used to to create something new. What better time to pay homage to the hacker slasher genre than in a season in which you're not touching on the supernatural at all? I also see a lot of parallels in Kai's decent into madness and Patrick Bateman's in American Psycho, and that's pretty bloody too. And Ryan loves referencing other horror media. And Roanoke had to be that way, I don't think it would have been the same story if it wasn't so murdery and torturey. I'm in the minority in that, albeit after my second watch, I'm beginning to love Roanoke and it's quickly becoming one of my top seasons (nothing will top the masterpiece that is Asylum though). It's just so disgusting and truly fucked up and I think it's brilliant. Each seasons deals with different themes and genres so it's only natural that they would build fear with different tools.</TEXT>

The guards have been stirring shit up all season for their sick little game, but interference breaks the rules so it would make sense that she would act surprised and horrified when finding the bodies, because the other guards would take away her points at the slightest sniff of cheating as it was near the end of the league and she was at the bottom.</TEXT>

Their entire prison life they've been trying to fuck each other over or kill each other, it's their whole identity and the entire prison social hierarchy is built on it. Also, as much as they hate each other, I think they love each other too - it's like the typical sister relationship but to the extreme. Whatever happened, I don't think it's as cut and dry as them killing each other, otherwise the producers would have shown us the fight, they've left it open ended for a reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry, what about any of my comments made you think I'm trying to avoid bad people or see them all redeemed? I'm talking about Black Cindy in particular, you know, the topic of this thread? Wanting Cindy to have a redeeming arc doesn't mean I want them all to have one. She seems to be going towards one, with her guilt and confession about fucking over Tastey and all the abandoned child stuff. And I'm saying I'd be happy about it if she did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If this is the cage I think it is, don't put anymore gerbils in there! I have this cage for my gerbils but I took out the wire level because I'm terrified of bumble foot and it was really hard to fit a wheel in there and as much substrate as I like them to have, even with the bump/bridge in the wire. I added wooden shelves instead, to give them height (and so they can always reach their water bottle and wheel even if they create holes). I'm also concerned about how low down your water bottle is, doesn't that strain their necks? I use those houses too but I bury them because my gerbils like to sleep deep down. Some people don't like this cage but I think it's the best one you can get from pet stores that's ready to go. Obviously bigger and deeper is always better, but with some modification and not worrying about mess, it can be good. [Here's what my cage looks like all set up](https://i.imgur.com/Lv5AdCq.jpg) and [here's what's actually inside it! (minus the daily cardboard I give them and they chew up instantly)](https://i.imgur.com/PfNJwzx.jpg) I pack it with as much substrate as I can and sweep away what they kick out, add lots of tubes and sticks and cardboard so they can use it as scaffolding (check out the bottom of the cage!) and they've got a toilet that they actually use (and they put all their seed and nut shells there too!) which means I don't have to clean them out as often because all their waste is in one place! Anyway, Edward is gorgeous!</TEXT>

It was only when I went shopping with her did we realise that it was gluten free and not meat free! I've eaten chicken on a pizza because the shop got it wrong and I was so high I didn't realise until I went to have the left overs the next day(and there was a lot of other topping on it). Shit happens, and it's gross and sad, but you can't blame yourself or feel guilty, you didn't do it on purpose!</TEXT>

They can't just kill off Ned." *"Lol nope"* "But he's the main character, how can the show continue without him?" *"That's Game of Thrones."* "I fucking love this show!" But I don't think that death *hurt* the most. It was certainly the most shocking and pivoting but I didn't cry. It's Ygritte. Holy shit, the tears that come out of me when that happens. I love their love, it's Romeo and Juliette on crack. She was an amazing character and they were a perfect match for each other. "Do you remember that cave? We should have stayed in that cave" Very closely followed by Cat's death. God DAMN, the emotion in that scene, the acting from her! Her expression changes so much she looks like a different person. "On my honour as a Tully, on my honour as a Stark!"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Will we finally meet Constance's fourth child in Apocalypse?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-12 10:52:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm re-watching Murder House and Coven in preparation for tonight (well, tomorrow for me - UK) and of course I'm reminded of our lack of information about Constance's forth child, so I went digging. All that we know as fact is that s/he was written into the show but taken out at the last minute, so we know s/he does exist but everything else, about him being an albino cross-dresser, is just speculation. Then I found a 4 year old thread discussing him/her with an interesting comment that linked to an old article. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/26hv8d/constances_fourth_child/chrc26g/  gt;"We know who the fourth child is, it was something that we had written and talked about and removed," Murphy said. "But we have not lost sight of the fourth child. In a fun show like this, that could be Season 4, I don't know. But we do have that story and that's something we'd talked about. That was the one thing that we did not answer but we want to answer that."  gt;"We will eventually deal with that, even though Jessica is not playing Constance," Murphy said with a laugh. What better time to revisit it than a Murder House/Coven cross over?! I am excited for many things Apocalypse will show us but this is one thing I really hope they revisit. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I must have skipped over the commentary but as a counter argument to those pictures;  gt;Although Ryan Murphy has confirmed in his audio commentary of the pilot episode that there was originally an albino Langdon child that was cut, these scenes have never been released. This makes the tiny photos on [this tumblr page](http://go-westfield-wolverines.tumblr.com/post/26198644852/american-horror-story-cut-scene) and all others purporting to be official promo images ([including the one on THIS page](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/americanhorrorstory/images/1/12/AHSalbino.png/revision/latest?cb=20120108010223)) highly suspect. The image above is very unrepresentative of photographer Robert Zuckerman's work; it is quite obviously dreadful Photoshop that doesn't even use the official AHS font. All such images are found only on fan squee sites without citation of official sources. The fashion model, Stephen Thompson, in the image above and on the linked website has made no confirmation of his casting either. It is my position that this brief mention of an albino has spawned a slew of fan art and fiction, good and bad but mostly bad. Either way, I want to meet him and hear his story!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I vote watch in order. Like everyone else has said, we all have different favourites and least favourites, ranging from absolute obsession to absolute hatred and anywhere in between. I think if we took a poll, Asylum (S2) would just about make sub favourite but for every post that expresses a like or dislike for a season, there's an equal amount of replies agreeing and disagreeing. I think Murder House (S1) is a good introduction, it has a bit of something for everyone and really sets the tone for the series. But each season, while being in the same universe, is treated almost like an entirely different show - different camera and filming techniques, different underlying themes, different references, moods, soundtracks - so being as you don't have much spare time, I'll try and give you a very quick, spoiler free, overview of them all and maybe you can make up your own mind. S1 Murder House - Classic Amityville story with lots of references to other classic ghost stories as well as real crime stories. Set in present day/2011 suburbia (I think). S2 Asylum - Set the 60s in a Catholic-run insane Asylum. Basically, anything horrible that happened, or people gossip about happening, in the 50s and 60s, they throw it in. I don't want to give too much away but this is a nail biting, tension building, masterpeice. Relies more on your investment in the characters than jump scares. S3 Coven - Witches and Voodoo queens. Strong slavery and resurrection themes. Highlights black vs white and men vs women. Possibly the most light hearted season (even with the slavery and race aspects) but that by no means takes away from it and works in context. S4 Freak Show - Set in the early 50s, in a time where freak shows are on the decline. We follow a troop of freaks trying to make a living and a home for themselves. Deals with rejection and loss a lot. Only a dash of supernatural in this one but the horror is real and very, very horrifying. S5 Hotel - Vampires. Vampires done properly. Lots of blood but not gorey, per say. The song Hotel California by the Eagles is played during the season and I wholeheartedly believe that they took a lot of inspiration from this song, rather than using a song fitting for the season. *There's more than just vampires but I'm trying to stay spoiler free*. S6 Roanoke - Found footage/documentary/reality TV type delivery. Builds tension and suspense by showing us little and drip feeding information and has a lot of jump scares. However, once it gets going, very gory and twisted and at times, hard to watch - definitely the one I watched peeping through my fingers. A lot of people's least favourite and I'll admit, I wasn't a fan on my first watch but I am definitely a lover now, especially after reading up on the real colony of Roanoke and their mysterious disappearance. S7 Cult - Exactly what it says on the tin. Very political and mostly set smack bang after Trump won the election. Deals with strong emotions - anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy. Lots of references to real life American cults. No supernatural at all. This is definitely more of a thriller than an horror. S8 Apocalypse - We don't know yet! But definitely do not start with this one as it's a cross over of Murder House and Coven and is probably going to reference itself a lot. I hope this helps and if I've missed something important, someone let me know! Note: All the seasons reference and draw inspiration from other horror media and real crime but in Murder House and Cult, it's much more obvious and integral to the main plot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Roanoke, they're not tied to the house. The Butcher is tied to the land and the souls of those who she kills or has killed are tied to her. Notice that the old people that died from neglect after the sisters were killed are not trapped spirits. In Hotel, I'm pretty sure it's because James Patrick March (based on H H Holms) built that hotel specifically to trap people and torture them, and his ambition followed him into the after life where he trapped spirits. Isn't the axe man the only trapped spirit in Coven? (Pretty sure Spaulding chose to stay there.) He was released by magic so it's only logical that he was trapped by magic. Plus he was stuck in that room, not the house. I'm not sure why they're tied to the house in Murder House but I'm trying to say that I think it's different for each location and there isn't one blanket rule.

    <TEXT>It's not you and it's not BDSM. It's these asshole "doms" that think abuse is the name of the game. It is **not**. If you get into another BDSM relationship, before anything at all happens (even a kiss), have each other sign a contract of sorts that clearly outlines each other's roles. A dom should spank you until you cry, then hold you close while they run a bubble bath for you. Aftercare comes in many different shapes and sizes but it is absolutely imperative. Without offering aftercare, they are not doms, just abusers. (a broad statement - some subs do not need or want aftercare but it should always initially be offered and spoken about before any play happens) [The Dominant's Creed](https://modemworld.me/ds-essays/188-2/) is a good place to start. If you present this to a new potential partner and they don't agree to it (modify to your personal needs) then nope the fuck out of there. Equally, if they present you with a similar sub creed and you don't feel you can uphold it then, it's time to leave. Remember, trust and communication comes before everything else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;!This is brilliant! Didn't know or ever notice clocks are sold at 10:10. Nice catch on the sewing machine refection! You are right that I love the sound of rain and water, it was just because you added "to work in".  gt;!I have more than one cat, and one of them (younger than the cat pictured) does actually jump up to the printer, but he's very careful about knocking things over so it doesn't matter where I place things. Actually, I'm quite lucky, all my cats are very careful about knocking things over. You wouldn't know, from her actions and mannerisms, that the cat pictured was a senior - she chose the tank over anything else because it's a very warm surface (heated water + not energy saving lights for the live plants)  gt;!Thanks for your insights!

    <TEXT>Be there for your mom being there for him. Explicitly tell her that you will be her rock and if she needs to talk, or get away for an afternoon, or just needs to cry, to come to you. Do something similar for your brother. As a teen, it's hard telling your mom and dr everything but older siblings, especially ones that aren't in your day-to-day life, are easier to talk to. Encourage him to lean on his dr and that s/hes only there to help. Don't try and give advice if you're not 100% certain about what you're saying. I'm always told to "go on a walk" but it only frustrates me and makes me sad because I'm agoraphobic and going for a walk is not as easy for me as it sounds, makes me feel worthless because I can't even do a simple, normal thing without a panic attack. Listen and love, that's the best you can do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you blanketed no on relationships because of your lack of libido? Have you thought about having an asexual relationship? To answer your question, for me it's an easier life in general. I'm an impulse buyer and since I've had a proper job, the guilt of buying things I don't really need has vanished, which takes a lot of stress and self hatred away. I don't have to count pennies at the grocery shop, I don't have to choose between food and warmth, I can afford to help other people in need. All these things add up and make everything a bit easier to deal with. It's like a gum ball. My depression is the gum in the middle and all the every day issues are the layers of candy around the outside. Money helps remove all the layers so I can get to and focus on the depression and not the little issues.</TEXT>

Dianne is flawed, she snaps at Mr. Peanutbutter, she lied to him about being in another country, she's mean to Bojack sometimes, but she *tries* to do the right thing and be a good person and make the world a better place, whereas Bojack is totally wrapped up in himself and doesn't try to be a good person but begs people to tell him he is one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what I thought. There's way too many ifs and buts without knowing what his initial reaction was. We're reading this from OP's point of view which is going to be tinted one way or another, but what if this other girl has social anxiety or is on the autism spectrum and has a hard time in social situations? Husband could be the person she trusts most in the office and when they went to run an errand, it was something personal to her so she didn't want the office knowing about it but wanted a friend there for support. It could be that this other girl feels like OP's presence in the office may affect her friendship with the husband and that's why she's being standoffish. It could be that they find each other attractive but never acted on it, and just being around OP makes them feel guilty even if they haven't done anything wrong. It could be that they're actively having an affair. It could be that OP has picked up on her name in casual conversation and then when she saw her she thought she was attractive and her husband's type so she's super sensitive to all these little things that wouldn't even be a thing if it was a guy or a woman she didn't deem to be his type.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She doesn't just intend though, she acts on it. She wrote an article that would surely cause massive problems in her marriage but did it anyway because fracking is horrible and she wouldn't just stand by and let it happen. She ran a campaign against Hank Hippopopalous to out him as a sexual predator, which again, would cause problems in her marriage. She might have lied to Mr. Peanutbutter about being in another country but she *did* go initially. She's constantly fighting with her boss and with herself because she wants to write more important articles and not just ones that will get clicks. What she did to Bojack was shitty but a big part of the reason she did it is because she didn't want assholes like Bojack to watch Filbert and feel like it's okay to be an asshole and not make themselves better people.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-19 12:44:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm probably missing something really big here but I'm confused as to what binds the ghosts to the house. Obviously, they have to die in the house to be stuck there but what *keeps* them there? Moira was released when her bones were moved, and this wasn't just a revelation in this week's episode, her and Constance talk about it in Murder House too. We don't know where most of the bones and bodies are but we can assume that Ben's body isn't buried there because why would his family bury him there after they found him? We KNOW the Black Dahlia isn't buried there because we saw her cut up and dumped on the side of the road a long way away. Yet, she's still trapped in the house. So, what are the rules?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly don't think magic has anything to do with it because Moira and Constance talk about her bones being trapped forever under the gazebo Ben builds and thus her chance of freedom. This assumes there was already hope for Moira if she could move her bones. When the rich property developer tells her he's going to build a pool, she's ecstatic because her bones will finally be dug up and found and that's no magic at all, just an excavator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Right but i think they purposely mentioned the bones to leave us dangling for this moment of closure. I don't think so, I don't think they knew they were gonna do a cross over when they were making Murder House. Why was she so happy when the rich property developer was gonna build a swimming pool? He wasn't magic AFAIK. I don't know why Moira didn't ask a living human to dig up her bones, though. Maybe she didn't trust Billie because she's Constance's close friend and everyone else died before they truly understood the nature of the house.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't have to stop being friends with them. I have a good friend who's a pathological liar but he's such a nice person. We've told him time and time again we're going to love him without the lies because we know the real him and that's why we're friend with him, but it's not something he can control. I think that he fully believes the lies he's telling when he's telling them. We just shrug them off and take everything he says with a pinch of salt, don't rely on him if he says he'll do something or meet up at a certain time and just generally not humouring his lies. He's calmed down in the last few years. It's almost definitely a self esteem thing so if you care about this person, I wouldn't cut them out because that'll only reinforce the issue.</TEXT>

This is the exact quote:  gt; #8220;That's the thing. I don't think I believe in deep down. I kinda think that all you are is just the things that you do. #8221; It is NOT, as you say, the outcomes of what you do, but the actions that you do. Dianne did all those things, regardless of the outcomes or intentions, she did those things.

    <TEXT>I know barely anyone in this thread agrees that this is possible but it's not the only dialogue that points to this. In the same monologue about her first born, Cersei also says "he was a fighter like his father" which could easily be a throw-away comment. However, when Davos finds Gendry back in Kings Landing working as a blacksmith again, he asks him to join him and Dany/Jon/Tyrion and Gendry says "I'm not much of a solider, but I am a fighter". I also don't think that it ruins the witch's prophecy. What's to say the witch was telling Cersei the WHOLE truth? Not just some of it? She didn't mention anything about her first born with black hair, which we know Cersei had, she only talked about the three blonde ones. I like [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9sunp8/spoilers_cersei_and_gendry/e8s785q/) by /u/joydivision1234. I don't think Jamie was thinking about his Kingsguard vows, but just that he couldn't kill a child. I think it's right up GRRM's street to have a peasant blacksmith be the actual, legitimate, heir to the throne, when all these powerful names are competing for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the opposite way, I think it's cruel to keep your cats inside, at least where I live because they don't have any predators. They're not like dogs, they're not really fully domesticated, there's a much thinner line between a feral cat and a domesticated cat than most other wild and domestic species, like cows or dogs. Cars are a bitch, but when I'm looking for a new house I always pick an area with quiet and slow roads. Luckily, I like in the UK so no coyotes, just foxes, and foxes are very skittish and somewhat weary of cats. I deflea my cats every month and worm them every three months. Nothing can be done about ticks but I don't get them that often. Always remove them carefully and then take them to a vets for a check up. They are all microchipped and neutered, have good insurance, a good diet and lots of love and care. Maybe if I lived in the US and a USA sized house, I'd consider keeping them in or creating a secure garden, but my house is tiny and I think the risks of going outside are worth giving my cats freedom and avoiding keeping them locked up, which can lead to mental problems and health problems (boredom, anxiety, over eating, under exercising). It's like having a kid for me, I wouldn't wrap them up in bubble wrap and keep them inside all their lives, but I make sure I have the money and the means to support them if they do get hurt. I think there's a massively different attitude in the UK/Europe, towards indoor and outdoor cats, than most of the rest of the world. Maybe because we typically have smaller houses and less dangerous wild animals.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone else notice a drop in quality in the T18E coils recently?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-06 13:57:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had my T18E for a year now, use it heavily every day and it's still going strong, no battery issues, no leaking on the device itself etc but in recent months I've noticed a significant drop in quality of the coils. At first I thought I just had a couple that missed quality control, which is fine, it happens, but now there's at least 2 bad ones in every pack of 5, and my last pack, they were ALL bad. They burn out a lot faster, they leak so I end up drinking a lot of my juice, they taste weird at first when changing coils (even given over 15 mins to settle before vaping) and I can physically see that the cotton isn't covering all the holes and that the rubber ring in the middle of the coil doesn't fit snugly. I buy them from both Amazon and my local vape shop so I think I can safely rule out fakes being as I'm buying from two completely different suppliers. Very early on, I found my brand, ratio and flavour of juices and stuck with them so I don't think it's anything to do with what juices I'm using. I LOVE my T18E, out of all the vapes I've tried, and there's been a lot, it's the only one that got me to stop smoking permanently, but if the quality of the coils stays this bad, I think I'm gonna have to find a new vape :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk man. 10/15 years ago I had a lot more "internet friends" and a lot more fun. Maybe it's me that's changed but I feel, especially before social media evolved, there was a sort of camaraderie between internet users, even if we were arguing and making drama. And you could find any video on YouTube but Google hadn't bought it yet. And no Instagram influencers, and no net neutrality issues, and less giants and way more niche communities. There was a feeling, almost of freedom, that could never be replicated in the modern internet environment where we're constantly being watched, by companies selling to us, scammers, the government, employers and each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;not sure how best to deal with an anti-vaxxer but being nice to them instead of calling them morons and being condescending will probably result in them being more likely to hear you out. This is true of everything and everyone. "You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar" - being condescending only makes the other person more defensive. However, it's very hard to be nice to someone who is endangering your child. One of our strongest natural instincts is to protect our children so no matter what side of the coin you're on, you're going to have to fight against your strong instincts to be nice to the other side, as both see the other as endangering their child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. Pet play is something some kinksters engage in and something some furries engage in. Pet play is about being owned and degraded, lead around on a leash, made to drink out of a bowl on the floor, having your arms and legs bonded so you have to walk on your elbows and knees, it's role play where the "owner" doesn't want to have sex with an actual dog, it's a power thing. ~~Furries... well... they like to pretend they are actually animals,~~ I'm not even going to pretend to understand it because I don't. Think of it as a Venn diagram rather than black and white categories. (BDSM ((pet play)) Furries). In other words, you don't have to be a furry to enjoy pet play, and not all furries enjoy pet play.

    <TEXT>Hey man, there's nothing wrong with mutation, it's how evolution works! The problem is selective breeding where *we* choose "attractive" features that often come with bad mutations that cause the animal's quality of life to suffer. See: almost every toy dog breed. Cats are fascinating because they actually evolved to be cuter and more amicable to humans. What ever mutation gave them such a cuddly wuddly face did better and passed the genes to more offspring because it meant we didn't mind giving them shelter or food, or at least not eradicate them from our villages and cities. Anyway, I'm rambling, the point is mutations can be a good thing but selective breeding will always be gross.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My cat's personality is changing and I've never experienced this before.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-06 12:46:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Cat, just turned 3 y/o, male, neutered, moggy, 4.5kg, UK. I have three cats and he is the youngest and also last to be added to the family, we have had him since he was 8 weeks old. **Update for anyone reading:** Why do I always get down voted in this sub :( I follow all the rules! We've taken him to a vet and the vet said everything was fine except his stomach felt gassy so he may have an upset tummy. She gave him an injection, an anti inflammatory I think (probably wrong, I have a terrible memory). We're going to see how he is with dinner and take him back tomorrow afternoon (and skip breakfast in case they want to take any bloods) and go from there regarding the personality changes. He may have developed anxiety, or it could be a temporary thing as they're all spending more time indoors and tensions are running a little high. **TL;DR:** cat has become more aggressive to a cat he lives with, more fussy towards me and needs less harsh/loud behavior correction in certain areas and seems to have dropped a life long food obsession over night, with minimal environmental changes. **History:** Has a habit of getting in fights with other cats, apart from general check ups and vaccinations etc, he's only been to the vets from fight injuries. He's not always aggressive to other cats though, he's friends with my neighbor's cat and one of my others (by that I mean, they will lick each other and play fight without aggression and comfortably share spaces). Up until now, he has been somewhat food aggressive, never ever misses a meal, eats way too fast, will stare at the other cats until they walk away and then eat their left overs. He was born into a house where feeding time was a free for all and then moved to my house with two already established cats so this makes sense to me. He got better with age, or the realisation that the other cats aren't going to steal his food/we won't let them but always kept the obsession. He's always been very tolerant of humans, doesn't wiggle when he's picked up, things like that, but never really sought out human attention or affection (maybe because he got enough of it because he was the baby of the family). I have a rodent room, which is really just a large cloak room with my little fluffs in it, attached to my living room/home office. He's always been a bit of nuisance with them to the point where I have a water spray bottle on my desk. **Personality changes:** My boyfriend feeds the cats in the morning and he's often woken up by Taiyo attacking his feet for food. This morning, Tai didn't touch his breakfast, even when put in front of it. We feed them half wet and half dry with every meal. When I woke up, his wet was gone but I can't say who ate that and he followed me from the bed to the kitchen and slowly nibbled his dry while I made my coffee. He ate it all. He has actively been asking me for fusses, not my boyfriend or visitors though. He's been way better about the rodent room, I don't even have to shout and clap, let alone use the water bottle. I just have to say his name in a stern voice and he meows at me, turns around, and butts his head into my hand. He's been super aggressive to my eldest cat (8 y/o, female, neutered - not the one he's friends with). TBH, they've never been friends but a fight was rare and would always start with the eye staring and growling. Recently, he's just been full on ambushing her without prior warning, one time she was *asleep* and he launched himself at her and grabbed the back of her neck with his teeth! **Environmental changes:** Obviously, it's winter so they've all been spending more time inside. I didn't have a felliway refill for months and have recently put one back in (but had an active one for most of his life) He's the only one with a collar currently because one lost hers and the other has sensitive skin/allergies and the collar was causing his neck to scab up. But they've had collars on and off all their lives. I've spent more time away from the house, but no more than a night or two at a time and a month apart. We changed flea and worm treatment brands to have a more complete treatment. The old one used to make his eyes sting, the new one doesn't. Everything else is the same, no difference in food, no new furniture (big or small), no house rearranging, no new pets. **Conclusion:** When it was just him being better about the rodents and asking for fuss, I thought he was maturing, but with the food and the aggression, I'm worried it's something more. This has been happening for about a month. Should I be worried? Thank you if you read this far (god, I can never keep anything short) and thanks in advance for any advice or new insights on the situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it's just the younger one. The other one and her don't really have much to do with each other. They don't fight, even when one is in the other's spot, but they don't cuddle either. They just tolerate and avoid each other. Weirdly enough, the one that's attacking her is the one she has more to do with. They're friendlier with each other at times (they let each other sniff each other when one's come in from outside, it's sweet) and sometimes they even sleep together, but she gets grumpier faster with him than my other one. Purely out of curiosity and nothing more (not a diagnosis because the symptoms you described aren't happening) what could be a probably cause for that? Something like they could smell/sense sickness on her and trying to push her out of the clan so it doesn't spread?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-07 12:35:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I hope everyone's having a good day, mentally and physically! :) I've been browsing this sub and other ftm subs lately but I've been hesitant to drop a comment in case I say something I shouldn't be saying. So my question is, is it offensive or out of line to tell someone they looked good in their before pictures? Being pan, I find myself being attracted to the before and after photos! For clarity, I would **never** say or imply someone looked *better* in their before pictures, it's more "you were gorgeous before and you're gorgeous now!". I would never use the wrong pronouns either. I think it's probably pretty personal for each person and I should just stick to complimenting after photos, but I'd love to hear your individual thoughts!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not gonna give you a number rating because it's hard to tell from just two pictures but from one pierced woman to another: Your lip stud isn't the right size and sticks out of your face. I much prefer it when the bar is small enough for the stud to sit snugly on the skin, it's a real pet peeve of mine when I can see the bar. But your septum fits perfectly! You shouldn't use dark or black eyeliner under your eyes, it makes them look small and you have wonderful eyes! This is not to say you shouldn't put anything under your eyes, if you were using eye shadow on top it's totally viable to swipe a little of the same colour underneath. I really think you'd benefit from eyeliner flicks/cat eyes. I know everyone does this but the shape of your eyes really lends itself to that technique. But this is just little things, you're very pretty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure about PS4 controllers, but whenever my xbox game pad doesn't work with my PC games (also using a bluetooth receiver) I have to manually update the driver for it and that seems to always fix it. So try this. Go to device manager (right click on start) and look for your controller in the list. If you can't see it, it may be under "unknown devices". Right click on it and choose update driver. Now usually automatically search is the way to go but not for this. Choose "browse my computer for driver software" and then "let me pick from a list of available drivers". I have a feeling this only works because xbox is Microsoft and so is windows, so if you can't see your driver in the list, it might be worth googling and downloading a driver for your specific controller, BUT we have got off-brand controllers (so neither sony nor Microsoft) to work this way also.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm confused, I was a bartender in England and this is how I and every English bartender I ever met always poured a Guinness: 1. Grab a Guinness glass 1. Tilt glass at 45 degree angle (like with any kind of foaming tap beer) 1. Fill to 3/4s - 4/5s of the glass 1. Leave to settle - go make the rest of the order 1. Top up the last 1/4 - 1/5 without an angle 1. Serve What were we doing wrong?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've done it with three different male bettas. Not only can they be kept with other fish happily, they have different personalities. My SO kept his betta with cherry shrimp, but one of my bettas would eat small shrimp. The rule is nothing frilly or overly colourful as the male betta will think they are other bettas and attack (or nothing nippy to save your betta's fins). Surprisingly, my SO's betta lived happily with neon tetras and when he died, we put the tetras in my tank and my shrimp eating betta was fine with them too. Shit, Esteban lived with ember tetras, African dwarf frogs, lots of different corys, blue tetras, golden tetras, celestial rasboras and glass catfish, didn't hurt any of them and died of old age. He would eat the invasive little snails though. He was a good fish, I miss him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It didn't feel like advice and I'm sorry I was standoffish. It felt like anon undermining my psychiatrist. I know there's dangers with any medication, not just anti-depressants but I reached the point of desperation. I stayed away from them as long as I could because I didn't want to need a happy pill, it just got far too difficult and I have responsibilities and people who would be very very sad if I killed myself. I struggled with accepting I need them for a long time, that's why I got so defensive. I'm not worried about the ones I'm on right now, and I'm not worried about the new ones I've been given, it's the situation I'm in. With any new medication, there's a period where you body gets used to them and your symptoms can get worse before they get better, I'm not in a situation where I have my support system around me but still need to be strong. These new meds could help me be strong in my current situation but they could also make things 10 times worse for a while and I wanted to talk to people who have experienced the particular meds I'm about to start. My Dr won't give me benzos because I have an addictive personality and while sometimes I resent him for it because I've taken diazepam in the past (given to me by friends with a prescription) and the anxiety just melts away, I know he's doing the right thing.</TEXT>

Perhaps it's location based - I'm from the UK. I introduce myself as Becca, not Rebecca, and I still get called Becky, Becks/Bex, Bec, Bexy and sometimes Becca. I've also had Rebec and Rebok. On the plus side, I was one of 3 Rebeccas in my year in school (a long time ago now) and we all got to pick one nick name each to avoid confusion. My personal favourite from your list, OP, is Ilaria.

Even though we have the "worst accent in the UK", we're also weirdly protective of it, like, no-one can pull off a Brum accent without being from Brum or turning it into a Black Country accent, apparently. In fact, I think the whole cast did a really good job - keeping in mind that back then the accent *was* a lot thicker than it is now - the only time it falls oddly on my ears is when Aunt Pol says certain things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HELP ME PLEASE I just bought a cartridge, I don't know what it's called because I'm in the UK so I didn't really acquire it via legal means, but [here's a picture.](https://i.imgur.com/JQeafc4.jpg) My everyday nicotine vape is the Inokin Endura T18E 2 and I was assured that this cartridge would fit, which it does. The problem I think is wattage. My vape has only three settings 10.5, 12, and 13.5 watts. The person I bought it off, he has his vape set to 4.8 watts. It hurts, a lot, it stings my sinuses in a way nothing I've ever inhaled ever has. It's like the sensation when you have too much wasabi and it's all in your nose and throat, but smells like cannabis. I circle smoke so it's really hard for me not to blow it out my nose, but even on the lowest setting, small tokes and making sure it doesn't go through my nose, it still hurts. More over, I didn't really get high. I was asking myself all evening if I was high or not. I have a high tolerance so I gave it some leeway and stuck with it but at 1am, I gave up and rolled a good old fashioned spliff and took a few tokes and was like "yeah, now I'm high". I bought a shitty slim vape pen hoping the smaller watts would help but honestly, it's a really shit pen lol. I want to use this cartridge because it's not easy for me to find and basically I only have one guy at the moment I can get them off. **My question is what type of battery do I want to be looking at to get the best out of this and these type of cartridges?** Price Range: Cheap as possible tbh, but willing to pay up to  #163;100 for a very good vape that ticks all the boxes. \# of Participants: Usually solo but occasionally with a friend. Toking Routine: Every evening, 2-3 spliffs a night. Extraction Speed: I like smoking. I don't like one big hit that lasts a while, I like to toke little and often. I will roll a couple spliffs a night but take a few tokes every 10-30 mins for the entire evening. Environment/Form: I really want one of those super thin ones because it feels like a cigarette or spliff in my hands, think /r/laquerENTstas but I know these might suffer on functionality. I do not want a massive battery however, I want it to be no more cumbersome than travelling with a plastic grinder and some papers. Vape Experience: Been vaping and making my own vape juices for over a year. Live with my SO who uses MtL sub olm coils (and a stupid big battery and clouds) Smoked weed for over 10 years. Don't know why I can't marry the two! Personal Requests: Apart from the thin one and what I've already mentioned about big batteries, I don't have many requests, I just want it to get me high without hurting. Location: UK Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you very much! I didn't realise I was in the wrong place lol. I'm not worried about the taste, tbh it tastes like a space cake but without the vanilla or sugar or sweetness. It's not a cotton coil, it's a ceramic coil? I don't know if my dealer is just blowing smoke up my ass but I can't see any cotton and I can't taste the burnt cotton taste I'm used to when my regular coils are burnt out. But yeah, thanks for the advice :D edit// haha /r/oilpen have a sticked recommenced battery list. I know reddit would have my answers, it's just where to find them on reddit!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not rude, don't worry! He's not my regular dealer, he's a friend's dealer who has always been an unreliable POS but I was in a rut and took a gamble. To be fair to him though, it wasn't that colour when I got it AND it was second hand - my friend, the middle man, wanted the cartridge the dealer brought for me because he's been very sick lately and it was apparently a medical one, so I bought his off him (that he'd had for only a few days) for a cut price. I then used it in my 10-13.5 watts battery and that burnt it more. So I think I burnt it but he sold me a shit cartridge too. But good news! I went to my local vape shop to buy a battery I researched last night and I was pointed in the right direction to sort out *everything*. I'm at home now, had a few tokes of my new set up and I'm pretty fucking high :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is a *really* noob question but google isn't helping me. How do I change my keyboard's functions/keybindings? I've bought a small keyboard and I love it but to switch between up arrow and the question mark, for example, I have to hold down Fn and the number 3 for 5 whole seconds. I want to be able to just hold down a key while I hit the key I need to get the third function on it, just like you hold down shift to get the secondary function of a key. My keyboard is a Motospeed CK62 if that helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for replying :) Unless I've missunderstood you, this doesn't work for me. This key is the forward slash key / the question mark key ? and the up arrow. I can get the forward slash normally, just by pressing it. I can get the question mark key by shift+/. Holding down Fn and the key just gives me /. If I switch modes, just pressing the key works as an up arrow. Shift pressing it highlights the text lines as I go up, Holding down Fn and pressing it in this mode only makes it act at the up arrow. This is the same for all the keys that have three functions. The third function simply doesn't work by holding anything down and pressing it, I have to switch modes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I can't reply in that thread because it's been archived but I've built on your original codes to have the arrow buttons in the bottom right of the keyboard to match the physical keyboard layout and I thought I should leave it here for anyone who wanted the arrow keys the same as me. I made capslock left shift + capslock because it's better for me and ~ can be reached via shift + # (On a British layout, not sure what that is on an american layout, I think it's backwards slash) SetCapsLockState, AlwaysOff CapsLock  amp; /::Up CapsLock  amp; SC15D::Down CapsLock  amp; SC138::Left CapsLock  amp; SC11D::Right CapsLock  amp; l::Home CapsLock  amp; .::End CapsLock  amp; ,::Delete CapsLock  amp; `;::PgUp CapsLock  amp; '::PgDn CapsLock  amp; Esc:: if GetKeyState("Shift") Send {~} else Send {``} return CapsLock  amp; 1::F1 CapsLock  amp; 2::F2 CapsLock  amp; 3::F3 CapsLock  amp; 4::F4 CapsLock  amp; 5::F5 CapsLock  amp; 6::F6 CapsLock  amp; 7::F7 CapsLock  amp; 8::F8 CapsLock  amp; 9::F9 CapsLock  amp; 0::F10 CapsLock  amp; c::Send {vkAFsc130} ;Volume up CapsLock  amp; x::Send {vkAEsc12e} ;Volume down CapsLock  amp; z::Send {vkADsc120} ;Volume mute CapsLock  amp; [:: Send {PrintScreen} CapsLock  amp; ]::Send {Pause}  lt;+CapsLock::CapsLock Thanks very much for this by the way, I know a lot of people don't like this keyboard but with this modification, I personally love it (especially for the price)</TEXT>

If you did this and only made it the smallest height, you won't be able to add stairs because one step is taller than the smallest foundation.

Stairs have 1x1 square at the top and bottom that can't intersect walls or objects so you'd have to create a little step outside the door for the stairs to sit on.</TEXT>

I have a stash of old PC parts I'm hoarding because who knows when my Frankenstein builds were gonna die. I recently turned 28 and for the first time ever, everything in my set up was bought brand new and pretty up to date. There have been hiccups and tears along the way but, good lord, was it worth it. Here's what she's sporting now: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 on a MSI Tomahawk B450 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX Zotac GeForce GTX 1060 6gb wrapped in a gorgeous Sharkoon TG5 RGB with a SteelSeries Rival 110 gaming mouse, Motospeed CK62 mechanical keyboard, 27" 1440p Asus monitor and the cutest headset I've ever seen.

    <TITLE>I just finished watching the whole thing for the first time and I'm a bit annoyed at the ending.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-06 15:16:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I understand that Ted loved Robin all along and that's probably why all his other relationships didn't work out but why does he love her? They have barely anything in common, and I really don't think Robin loved him all along at all. I feel like because they stayed in the same friend group, Ted couldn't move on and that's why he was always obsessed with her and we could easily swap Robin out for any other person he dated, as long as they stayed in the friend group. I think Robin and Barney were the best suited for each other out of everyone they dated, including Ted and Quinn, and it pissed me off that they got divorced because she traveled a lot. Neither of them are lovely dovey got to be together all the time type people and an open marriage would have worked with them, I think Robin even bought it up once! What annoyed me the most is how the kids just accepted that their father was in love with another woman the whole time. Wouldn't that make his marriage to Tracy that birthed them basically a lie? He just settled for this amazing woman because a not-so-amazing woman kept rejecting him. Tracy should have been the love of Ted's life, she was amazing and sweet and nerdy and they had so much in common. I thought she was enough to get Ted over his obsession with Robin because honestly that's all it was, it was obsession and the inability to let go because she was always there. I just wish it ended like "and your mother was the one who showed me what true love *really* was, everyone up until that point had been a stand in until I found her and I finally dropped my obsession with your aunt Robin, who is a wonderful woman but we should have stayed best friends, not lovers". Anyway, that's my two cents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm totally on board with mounts. Maybe the mount could have it's own stamina bar (but would go down slower than the player's) and would need feeding and watering just like the player (more so because the mount will be bigger than the player) and also contract diseases and infections. When you're not using it you would have to pay a stable fee and it would only be available in the town you left it in. Then this leaves it up to the player if it's worth buying one, or keeping one with them at all times to avoid costs but risk it's well being. They could go so many places with it, like you could have a horse or a pearl bird to get from A to Z but it freaks out if you dismount and get into a battle near it and runs home (or runs away aimlessly if you haven't trained it where home is). You could train a fighting mob that doesn't freak out and maybe even helps you a bit but is harder to "break", slightly slower, can carry less and needs meat, not just travel rations/seed. You could buy, craft and upgrade amour for it. You could give it it's own bag so you can carry more (but same rules apply about being overweight etc and the weight of your amour and bag would be taken into account too) I think with a mount I'd be okay without fast travel but my ideas for fast travel regardless: The caravans leave twice a day from each city, once in the morning and once in the evening, and if you miss it, tough shit. Boats! Expensive but very fast, possibly with the same features as an inn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This could all be bullshit and a case of history being written by the victors and maybe the Long Night never even happened and it's all a cover up by the Starks because they are all decedents of the Night's King who is a bastard. It all starts with Bael the Bard, a King Beyond the Wall, who dressed up as a peasant to infiltrate Winterfell and sang to the Lord of Winterfell. He was so impressed by his singing that he told him to name his reward. He ended up impregnating the only child the Lord of Winterfell had left, leaving a bastard called Jon Snow/Stark. Ygritte to our Jon: "Jon Snow, an evil name" and "I have the blood of Bael, just like you". She sings a song of a love story about Bael that our Jon has never heard. The baby was legitimised as there was no other heirs to Winterfell and never told of his true father. 30 years later, Bael led a raid over the wall which Jon Stark headed off. Bael couldn't bring himself to kill his own son and thus let Jon kill him. Jon bought Bael's head back to Winterfell as a trophy and upon seeing this, his mother threw herself from a tower as she loved Bael and couldn't bare it. Jon Stark then relinquished his seat at Winterfell to his son and took the black, eventually becoming the 13th commander of the Night's Watch. The only woman to visit the wall around this time was a girl described to have white skin and blue eyes, and guess what her name was? Danny. Obviously she was not met with open arms, she was raped and abused by the crows and Jon saved her, eventually falling in love with her and marrying her. Later, Bran the Breaker, Jon Stark's younger half brother and the new King Beyond the Wall, took down Jon and killed his wife. Jon fled north and became an other. Then the Starks made up the story you detailed, destoryed all records of Jon and his name, to cover up their true lineage and paint themselves and heroes. These two videos explain it better than I did and show evidence for this, well worth a watch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrWssxTdnKA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNHpP-w_Apo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not true at all, if it were she would have come to Westeros and claimed the throne the moment she took control of the Unsullied. Instead, she stayed in Essos for about 5 years, liberating 3 slave cities. Then she got to Westeros and instead of killing Cersei and taking the throne, she calls a temporary truce and goes north to save Jon and the North. She has the Unsullied and the Dothraki and [had] three dragons. She could have taken the throne, let the Walkers destroy the North and cleaned up the rest like Cersei is planning on doing. Killing the Tarleys is probably the worst thing she's done and she gave them a choice first. I'm not saying she's perfect, no-one in this story is, but she accepts advice from people who know better, she learns and she grows and she does care about the common people, not just the throne. Regarding killing Sam's brother and Dad and Jamie killing her dad, yes it is somewhat hypocritical but there are a lot of differences. The first being, like I said, she gave them a choice. There was no need for Dickon to step up and die with his dad, that was totally his doing. The other being, she grew up with stories of this horrible man that killed her father and what his family did to the rest of her family. She hasn't had Sam's mom and sister raped and smashed against a wall. She's only recently accepted that her dad was actually terrible (but the rest of her family weren't, and they still died in horrible ways) so it would be weird as fuck if she just welcomed Jamie with open arms without mentioning their grim connection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What has liberating slaves in Essos got to do with the Iron Throne? She got her armies, the Unsullied and the Dothraki, by force. Sure, she gave the Unsullied a choice to leave and this was liberating them but she didn't have to do that, she'd already killed their master, she could have just taken them all. The Dotharki *took* slaves and they follow her because of her power, they don't care that she does good things. When Gendry bought the news that the gang were stuck on a rock, did she have to fly North to save them? Not at all, in fact, letting the King in the North and his men die would have made it easier for her to take the North. She definitely wants the throne, that's her end goal no doubt, but not everything she does is for that purpose, she has deviated many times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This would make sense if Westeros was a democracy and voted for their ruler, but they're not. Monarchs take or inherit thrones. She's not going to spend 5 years liberating slaves in a land Westerosies don't care about for a few extra brownie points with people who have no say over who sits on the throne. And again, saving the King in the North might make her slightly more popular with the Northerners, but it's a huge gamble for a small pay off, she lost one of her children and how has it turned out for her? They don't like her. She didn't risk all that for favours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>??? Do you think they just pulled this ice man from their asses? He might not have been introduced into the current time line in the books yet but The Night's King and the long night and "winter is coming" has been referenced in the books and history books many times by GRRM. ~~When D amp;D came to GRRM to propose making a show out of his books, he only sold them the rights when they guessed how it would end, how could they guess how it ended without knowing what "winter is coming" truly meant?~~ Just cause he hasn't written and released it in the current timeline, doesn't mean he didn't create it. The Night's King has been around for at least 1000 years, and it's possible there was one before him too, do you really think GRRM had no part in creating him? All he is is the leader of the Others/White Walkers and you can't deny GRRM created them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you should give up on your friend just yet, unless you don't care too much about the friendship, I think she: 1. Has been in or has been close to an abusvie relationship before 2. **Possibly** already had a problem with your boyfriend 3. Has absolutely no experience or knowledge of BDSM 4. Really cares about you. Imagine you'd never heard of BDSM, that it was a totally new consept to you and you simply didn't even believe it exists, and then you see bruises on your friend and "abusive" text from her boyfriend. Then she *defends* him, without knowing about BDSM all the signs point to abusive relationship, it sounds like excuses. Give her something to read outside of yourself, like this community! Show her it's not a mental illness. She's ignorant of this kink but I think everything she's doing is out of love and worry for you. But, I'm really glad you stood up for yourself and I'm super happy your sister understands!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My sim isn't losing weight even though she's working out almost every day and eating the same amount of food as her family.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-06 00:21:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Sims 4] I'm doing the apocalypse challenge so the family are eating one portion of the same food every day (fried fish) and no-one else is exercising bar the dad who is doing an athlete career. No-one else is putting on weight. The sim in question is the teenage daughter, she aged up to a somewhat chubby child and then aged up into a teenager with weight and muscle sliders at max. Because the dad has to mentor fitness for his daily task I decided he should mentor her because everyone else was too young or had a job they needed to do their own daily tasks for. She exercises on the multi-trainer exercise machine at least 4 times as week for a full work out and then for push the limits to reach her dad's daily mentor goal. Sometimes I even send her jogging when all her bars are full and she's got nothing else to do. She's definitely not eating more than anyone else because I have to cancel any automatic making food actions (they have to go fishing first), there's no fridge of microwave, food goes off super quick, and there's only enough portions for everyone to have one each before I have to go fishing again! I feel like it's a bug, but I've repaired my game and batch fixed my mods and cc and she's still not losing weight. Moreover, the dad got super hench, and since he only has to mentor and not work out for his daily task, his definition is fading so I know the fitness scaling is working overall. Her traits are Art Lover, Loves Outdoors and Genius so it's not like she's a glutton or lazy? The mom hasn't exercised since the daughter became a teenager and her abs are still obvious, even though she's had a baby or two since then so I'm wondering if she's broken too. Anyone else had this problem or know how I can fix it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He had premonitions, like Mellisandra would in the fire, and they were metaphorical and hard to interpret (hence why Melli kept getting it wrong). Like you said, he "saw" Theon taking over Winterfell, but he saw it as a giant wave crashing over the walls, which, looking back makes sense but looking forward, very hard to understand. That was Bran Stark, he's not really Bran anymore, he's the 3ER so I guess he has a new set of powers that are very similar, but significantly different, to what Bran had.</TEXT>

Also, I'd get obsessed and paranoid that she's getting herself in danger and in a constant state of worry when I'm not with her. Soso - I think this relationship would last a while, I think we'd make each other better people. What she lacks in subtly and social ques I could guide her and what I lack in care and activism she would motive me and we'd do protests etc together. Lorna - She's just adorable all round but I don't think it would last long, I couldn't deal with all the lies and I'd want to take care of her but sometimes I need taking care of too. I can't pick just three! Poussey - She's just an incredible, beautiful person inside and out with so much passion. She might get bored of me though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, at least this time around. FAs will point back to the 60s but there's literally 30 years of non activity between then and the new movement. The 21st century modelling industry re-birthed it because (albeit they they were getting a lot of criticism for their crazy standards) they wanted to push the idea that you didn't have to be 5'8, skinny, have small symmetrical boobs and perfect skin to be beautiful.</TEXT>

PAH have come a long way with their fish, I love the new points system, but sometimes they fall through the cracks.

We've seen it time and time again, it is something that will make PC happy. Or maybe, she becomes a mother and it isn't everything she thought it would be, and she realises that her "want" to be a mother was just embedded in her from a young age and with every miscarriage and failed adoption she wanted it more and more because she couldn't have it. So PC gets her baby but isn't happy. Omg I'm gonna make myself cry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm really intrigued by the 3500+ cal. Were you put on that as soon as you came in? Was it going to go down once you reached a "healthy BMI", or did you start on lower and they slowly bumped it up? I just can't fathom how anyone with ED, restrictive, BED or otherwise would deal well with being told they had to eat 3500 cal a day without exercising. It seems a bit extreme to me? Like going from 0 to 100. I've never been in recovery because I've never been "bad" enough for anyone to worry so I don't know how it all works. What were you eating? IE, was it balanced or did you just have to eat 3500 no matter what it was? Did you have to count the cals or did they do it for you? How are you now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are definitely not the only person to do this, it's a topic that comes up quite often in this sub. I've done it when telling certain people, like parents, to watch the show. However, The National Anthem was the first episode I ever watched because I was recommended it by like-minded people and they told me just to start from the beginning. I think it's a very good introduction to the whole thing, jumping in the deep end and leaving you thinking what else this series can produce.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loved it as well, possibly my favourite one. Ashley Too was good but it didn't feel very black mirror, more dark Disney. Striking Vipers raised some good talking points, but Smithereens was harrowing and had me sobbing. Don't understand people saying there was little or no conclusion, I felt the conclusion was pretty apparent, we just didn't physically see it. The _only_ thing that annoyed me is where the snipers positioned themselves. They could have gone anywhere and they put themselves in the worst possible place for a clear shot lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds like you need a long hot bath with candles, lots of nice smelling products, some wine/weed/your preferred poison. Get a laptop or phone in there and watch your favourite safe film (mine are Finding Nemo and Princess Mononoke). Deep condition your hair, get some body scrub, a face mask (not the pealing kind, they get tight as they dry), do your hair removal (if you do) really slowly. Get out and cover yourself in moisturiser. You could order your favourite take away for when you get out and have a Netflix binge. Or, if you have the energy, change your bedsheets before you get in so you can curl up all clean in fresh sheets. Or both! Pizza in bed! Basically you just need some hardcore self-care. Maybe you're a creative and you need to spend sometime losing yourself in your craft (cross stitch, embroidery and knitting are good because you can just lounge on the sofa doing it). Or if you're an exercise junkie, some light yoga. A gamer? Something chilled and single player like Civ or the Sims. What could be an idea, and this is an and/or suggestion, you could keep the convo with that Dom vanilla and go and see him (or better, have him some to you) and just have a session of aftercare. I don't know what your aftercare dynamic is like obviously but some ideas could be he runs your bath and sets up the smellies and candles, gives you a long, soft full-body massage, cooks you both a nice dinner (or orders the take away), cuddle up on the sofa watching something that makes you happy and calm, strokes your hair.</TEXT>

If you love this man and are willing to put the effort in (and he too is) then you should go to couples counselling and he should get a personal therapist before you guys even consider trying BDSM again. If you're at the end of your rope, noone would blame you for leaving, I mean, he's actually emotionally abusing you and it'll only get worse if he at least doesn't do something about it.

    <TEXT> gt; Hell we have banned people from visitation just for setting up those essential oil diffuser/mister contraptions. What's wrong with this? I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer by any stretch of the imagination but aromatherapy is pretty cool. It doesn't do much except help with anxiety/meditation but I imagine someone in hospital could do with some anxiety management. When my friend was giving birth we had one in her birthing room, not at out request, it was part of the hospital. When she went into a bout of panic near the end, the midwife put some peppermint on a tissue and made her smell it and it instantly calmed her down. It was on the NHS so they weren't trying to make more money out of us. I have a vanilla reed diffuser on my desk and it helps with my anxiety, when I get a whiff of it I feel comforted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If a placebo works, it works. Besides, vanilla has calmed me down since before anyone suggested it to me. Your smell receptors are one of the strongest things that trigger memory and I must have happy  amp; calming memories surrounding vanilla. As for my friend, I highly doubt she was in a state of mind for placebo to work, she was pushing a child out of her vagina and panicking, the midwife didn't say "this will calm you down" she said "smell this please". Perfumes and colognes are not essential oils but I understand a blanket rule on all smelly things to be on the safe side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a self harmer and a masochist and they are not one and the same. Sure, they have similarities but so do apples and oranges. Also, there are masochists who have never self harmed and self harmers who would never want to be spanked in a sexual situation. Maybe there's a correlation but correlation =/= causation and if anything it'll be because self harmers aren't afraid of pain and have a different relationship with it than someone who doesn't. I've indulged in knife and blood play. The person whom I did it with was apprehensive at first (we were in a relationship and he knew about my self harm) and didn't want to "trigger" me or "encourage" me and took some convincing but after the fact he realised it was completely different and we did it a few more times. I've even participated in mutual self harm, which from the outside might look like knife play but there's nothing sexual about it. Self harm comes from a dark, sad, personal place. It's for release, it's an addiction, it's a comfort. I don't get wet or sexually excited when I hurt myself. Wanting to be hurt in sex/a scene comes from an exciting, titillating, sub space. It's about domination, submission, trust, being so in tune with the other person that you give up your whole body to them, knowing they won't take it too far. I mean, you understand that someone who indulges in rape play doesn't actually want to be raped, right? Those things are even more similar than self harm and masochism but you get that it's not the same thing. Edit/ Also, sorry, self harm is not a "personal preference". That's a really weird term for it. Alcoholism isn't a personal preference. They're self medications and addictions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What?! That is not what the blood is at all! You think that once a month our bodies tear something off it's self causing us to bleed?! Holy shit, no. During our cycle, our womb builds up a nice soft lining to receive and house a fertilised egg. When no egg is fertilised this lining and the egg is shed and that's what the blood is. Have you never noticed that your period blood is darker and thicker than blood from a cut on the outside? The pain you feel is not something tearing apart, it's your muscles cramping and flexing to help loosen and push the lining in the right direction, that's why it comes in waves, it's basically a small contraction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They probably outsourced the website to a design company that doesn't know anything about violins, who then used a stock image taken by a company who doesn't know anything about violins. Stock images are rarely ever perfect but a lot cheaper than buying a camera and studio equipment to take one image for your website. I would not use a stock image on a website to decide about the violin knowledge/validity of school and rather decide based on the actual school.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know, I mean, which other group could they have done it with? The white girls had Red and no-one's dethroning her any time soon and the Spanish/South American's had myriad women to take the "mother" role, certainly no space there for a newcomer. The black girls had a void in that space that was very easy for Vee to fill. You could argue that Tastey was the mother there, but it wasn't necessarily a role she chose or wanted and Vee was her actual ("adopted") mother outside, with years of experience of manipulating her and keeping her under her heel. And I don't really think they were portraying the black community in that season, nor did they turn into black stereotypes, it was prison gang culture and prison gang stereotypes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It means "pause" but what exactly "pause" means can be anything. I've been on breaks from two long term relationships but in both we talked extensively about what that break meant before going on it. In the first, it was that we weren't going to talk to or hang out with each other for 2 weeks but being romantic or intimate with another person was off limits. In the second, it was simply a break from living together and the relationship responsibilities for an undetermined amount of time, but talking and hanging out was still on the cards, being intimate with someone else certainly wasn't. I've known people to go on breaks where being intimate with someone else was allowed.</TEXT>

Also, my friend with a baby (also from the UK) powders her baby after baths to make sure she's fully dry. So it's certainly not unique to Asia or babies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a cat person 100% but Jurassic Bark gets me hard. I don't think it has anything to do with Seymour being a dog, he could be a cat, or a child, or a robot alien, it's the loyalty, love and the fact that _we_ know he's waiting in vain but he doesn't. It's just gut wrenching that he never gives up. I think it's made worse by the fact that Fry loves him and would have bought him to the future if he had the choice and he actually tried to clone him in the future. Fry makes the moral decision that it's not right to bring him back, he says something about Seymour living a full life after he got frozen but then we get the montage of him getting older and spending his life waiting for Fry. During this sad montage, we start to realise that it probably would have been best for Seymour **and** Fry if he had been cloned in the future but we just watched that possibility be destroyed in the previous scene. Shit I'm seriously tearing up, I can watch that episode but I have to skip that scene.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing, but because dictators like Stalin, Hitler  amp; Mao all called their regimes communism, communism = bad. They fail to see that calling something one thing doesn't make it so. NK's full name is The Democratic People's Republic of Korea so if communism is bad, then so is democracy! Also they think communism and socialism means that they'll work really really hard for something, only for it to be taken away from them and given to someone who sits on their ass all day for no reason other than laziness. Edit// Hitler did not call Nazism/his party communism, rather "National Socialists" but trust me, that does not matter to the people who think communism = dictatorship, those that use "dirty commie" as an insult. Socialism is closer to communism than it is capitalism so therefore it's communism.</TEXT>

We saw what it did to the other well-meaning wardens, and while they got out before it turned them rotten, Fig has always been very career driven.

        <TEXT>Nah, it's fine! Stains =/= dirty. I think people saying it ruined their favourites are when they're wearing something cute or sexy and get their period early or forgot it was that time of the month, cause you don't really want stains on clothes you're wearing when you're getting intimate. I think that's all it is!</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Feeling inadequate, old and devoid of hope after reading your very youthful and ambitious reply. Also, thinking about how I hope GRRM manages to finish the ASOIAF books before he kicks the bucket because I will not let that franchise break my heart twice. Outside of my brain bag, I'm getting into bed, watching Brooklyn 99 and whatsapping a friend about what would happen to gel nail extensions if I went rock climbing with them, being unreasonably detailed about it because I know he doesn't really give two shits. Then I think I might click on your link because elves and shit are my jam. Cheers for asking!</TEXT>

        <TEXT>YTA, fuck you. Pretty much all beauty things (except nails because it's one of my hobbies) go on the joint grocery shop. Moreover, my boyfriend doesn't complain when I haven't shaved in a while, he still thinks I'm sexy without make up on or hair done up and doesn't expect me to do anything beyond basic hygiene.  gt;If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? If me and my BF broke up, I'd pay full rent but we're not broken up so we split it. What kind of fucked up logic is this?  gt;or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves. You'd be goddamned surprised. More people than you think are not "conditioned" to expect women to do all this upkeep. Your girlfriend was putting a lot of time and effort into looking nice for you, and you chastised her for spending too much time doing it because you were ignorant. Everything has a consequence and the consequence of you mocking her for taking ages in the bathroom was her realising how much easier and cheaper life is when she doesn't have to do all that stuff. Seriously, fuck you and more power to your gf. Either pay your half and let her have as much time as she needs or deal with the body hair and no make up.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2019-08-18 15:09:43</DATE>
        <TEXT>I've been playing FFXIV a lot lately and I'm loving it. I haven't played an mmorpg since the first two weeks of WoW: Legion, three years ago (and even then, that was a trial come back after leaving during WoD in '14). In those 5 years, my anxiety and social anxiety has sky rocketed which is why I'm not sure if I'm just being overly sensitive or if this guy is genuinely creepy. So I met someone on there, we added each other as friends and casually chatted, doing his daily roulette together. I haven't explicitly said I am a girl but I haven't hid it either. Between mentioning my boyfriend to the amount of time I spend glamouring (cosmetic armour) to the way I generally talk, I think it's pretty obvious I'm a girl. I will mention that at some point I told him I'd watched hentai in the past and feel like this is where I messed up*. This was before he started making me feel uncomfortable. It started with him telling me he was happy to have found me as a friend and that I'm a nice person and at first I reciprocated because it was nice I'd made a friend after all these years, but then he started laying it on a bit thick and telling me all too often. I stopped saying it back and would just reply to something else he'd said. Then I asked him what he'd done with his day and turns out he likes to make music and he'd produced a track and named it after my character. I didn't know how to feel about this and asked my irl friend, who introduced me to the game, what he thought. He said it was strange but to give him the benefit of the doubt. So I did. Last night I afk'd and noticed he'd found me in game and was emoting at me. I was high and didn't feel like socialising so I left it, assuming he would go away and do his own thing realising I wasn't tabbed in - I didn't log out because I wanted to see how long he would stay and I wanted to carry on sorting out my bags eventually but my online status was permanently afk. He didn't. For three hours until I finally logged out, he was by my character poking her and talking to her. Three hours. I didn't see everything he typed to me because I was idle in a big city so lots of things going on but the last thing I saw him say was "I want you ;)" and that's when I logged out. The game does log you out automatically if you're not doing _anything_ for a certain amount of time but if you've paused a cut scene, talking to an npc, looking at the market board, pretty much anything but just standing there it doesn't log you out and I had my retainer windows open. I dont know if he knows this or not so it may have looked like to him that I was "there" because it never logged me out. Also, he likes to craft which is something you can do sitting in a city, especially the area I was (around shops and market boards) however, I never saw any chats that said "xx has synthesised such and such" when I came to check if he was still there. Moreover, I know that he spends more time crafting in a different city to the one I was in so my spidey senses think he came looking for me. He's also casually mentioned a few times how his FC (guild) like to roleplay sex, and stories of random people trying to initiate things of a sexual nature with him, which, on it's own is just fine but lumped with his other actions feels off to me. I asked him where he finds these people, he said he thought it happened to everyone. I replied that it hasn't happened to me yet, maybe because I dont really role play, to which he said "but this _is_ an rpg ;)". I'm sooooo bad at keeping things short but I tried to give some reasons as to why he might just be innocently exploring the game. He said this is his first mmo. Either way, I no longer enjoy or feel comfortable talking to him and I honestly wanna blacklist/block him but also I dont wanna be a dick to someone. So girls, is this guy creepy or am I being unreasonably sensitive/socially awkward? *if you're interested as to why I told him, or think it's important to conclusion: I'd asked him what the last good game he'd played was and he replied that I would think him a degenerate if he told me. He told me anyway and it was a hentai game. I didn't think he should feel embarrassed or uncomfortable so I shared that I'd watched hentai to help make him feel less awkward.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yeah your last paragraph really resonates. The conversation wasn't sexually suggestive in any way other than the unfortunate topic. I also don't have a problem with people engaging in ERP/being a bit pervy, as long as the recipient is consenting. I guess he read me being friendly and empathetic as more than it was. And you're so right about guy friends, I asked him because he's been playing for years but I never considered the fact that he himself is a guy would factor into his answer.</TEXT>

I _know_ I haven't led him on or given him any reason to believe these boundaries were okay but at the same time, I haven't played a social online game in years so I feared I'd a. Been too overzealous and trusting that I'd made a new friend for the first time in ages and b. Forgotten the general levels of etiquette for mmos. I'm so glad I posted here because in hindsight, it's clear as day that he overstepped but I would have been second guessing myself for ages.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>NAH. You're definitely not the asshole for wanting to enjoy time as a new family but your wife isn't an asshole for wanting extra help from her mom. I don't really think it's about how much she has to do and from the little you've told us, it sounds like she's having anxiety. It's tricky because having her mom there is a crutch and will make it harder for her to realise bathing your baby isn't scary, but at the same time, having a baby is a massive thing and having her mom there is helping her deal with it. Navigate with caution, empathy and compassion. Another month of your life isn't much as you do have the rest of your life to be a family but I would try to pursue professional avenues if after the month she's still not settling in.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I agree with you. A lot of people thinking vaping = juuls but if you spend any time around people who vape you'll know that we condemn juuls. Juuls are awful, they have an insane amount of nicotine in them, far more than a cigarette! "Normal" vapes have about 30% of nicotine than a cigarette, which is variable because you can change how much nic you put in your juice, most people vape 3mg. For reference, cigs are about 10-12mg and juuls are 18mg! There's just no need for it (apart from getting teens hooked on it). It's crazy that they offer it as a way to quit smoking but put MORE nicotine in!</TEXT>

        <TEXT>There's a MASSIVE difference between having a handful of people see your genitals (half of whom are in the same boat as you) and having your genitals be broadcast on national and international TV and forever kept on the internet. I don't think it's about the USAs fear of nipples, I think it's more for the participants privacy. I think a lot less people would apply if they knew they won't be blurred out. It's called *Naked* and Afraid because they start out with nothing, there's no rule that they have to stay naked. I think a lot of them choose to stay naked so they can use their energy on finding food and collecting firewood instead of making clothes. Idk, I've never wished they weren't blurred out so it's not something I've put much thought into until now. I don't think it's necessary and would distract from the main point of the show IMO. It might get more ratings but I can see a very slippery slope of only bringing on conventionally attractive contestants.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>The cardboard tube is probably fine but I wouldn't give my gerbils one with so much glue soaked into it. Generally, any un-dyed or un-coated cardboard is good :) Gerbils are burrowers so they can never have too much substrate! I'd probably fill this up half way, but also add some little houses and tunnels in it to give them some structure. Also, do you have a wheel? I can see a shadow of one in the background but there's none in the cage?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I just use paper bedding and after a day or two, he's walked all over it enough to pat it down and make it a bit more firm, making tunnels easier to stay up. However, I do add a lot of bits and bobs that end up being used a structural support. Things like cardboard and toilet roll tubes, willow sticks, he has little houses, toys and plastic tunnels buried in his fluff. I've attached a few shelves to the bars on the top of the cage so no matter how much he messes up his fluff he can still reach his water bottle and wheel. Ideally, we would give them literal dirt to dig in, but I've always had a hard time finding non-toxic stuff and you'd have to clean it out a lot more often because mold would be a bitch. But, if you have the time and patience, that would be the best bet. To address your problem specifically, the hay and paper are probably working against each other, have you tried just paper? I personally wouldn't use hemp bedding because it's too much like wood shavings and I get paranoid about them getting a splinter.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>You don't need to go to the gym, you don't need to grow facial hair. You're certainly not ugly but I can tell from these pictures that you hold yourself in an awkward manor. That's probably what's doing it. I know it's a scary word but you need to hold yourself with more confidence. Stand tall, shoulders back, keep your head up. New glasses and a hair cut wouldn't hurt either. (And not those light sensitive kind - I've never seen anyone manage pull those off - get prescription sunglasses and normal prescription glasses) Although, long hair on men is not terrible and can be done well, but you need to keep it maintained and the confidence to pull it off. Your hair in the top right and the bottom left are the worst. Top left and bottom right reads "I have long hair on purpose" but the former two read "I had a hair cut a year ago and haven't bothered with it since". Either go long or go short, not that awkward phase in between where it's not shoulder length but it's starting to flare out at the shoulders/neck.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I don't disagree but the gym can seem somewhat overwhelming for some people. Especially with gym culture as it is now. Telling him to "go to the gym" isn't the same as "do some light exercise because it'll make you feel better". Near everyone in this world would benefit from more exercise, but that's not his main problem here. He hears "go to the gym" over and over, he's going to think he needs to get swole to get girls, which he doesn't. Not every girl wants a hench guy, his issue is how he is presenting and holding himself.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2019-12-04 13:40:30</DATE>
        <TEXT>I've had my rabbit snail about 2 years. His name is Rupert, I love him. He's been in the same tank since I bought him home. A couple weeks ago, I noticed Rupert hadn't moved in a few days. This wasn't unusual so I left him to it. As time went on, he still didn't move and I slowly started to accept that he was dead, I've had him for a long time and I didn't know how old he was when I bought him, after all. The morning after a water change, I saw he was a few inches behind his original resting place, hurrah! But alas, the joy was short lived when I realised he was probably just pushed back by the flow of water as he wasn't suckered onto anything. So I made the decision (and please don't judge me) that I would leave him in there and let the little bastard trumpet snails clean him out. I wanted to do something with his shell, like cast it in resin, to memorialise him. Obviously some extra water changes to compensate. Yet, none of those invasive little fuckers that hitchhiked on some plants into my home were gathering around him. Strange, I thought, I've seen them jump on passed on fish the moment they touch the sand. Maybe they had respect for the big OG? Maybe they have some moral objection to cannibalism? Maybe they hate the colour orange? I had no idea. Today, at least two weeks since he stopped moving, I walked past the tank and what is this?! He's slithering about the glass at the top of the tank! Trying to navigate the Betta hammocks that were installed during his long nap. True joy! The SO is bringing some chocolate home tonight to celebrate our first Snail Easter, which we will celebrate during the first week of December from now on, in honour of Rupert the Risen.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yeah I think this is the reason. The tank hasn't dropped below 24 #186;C to my notice but we've had a sudden drop in temperature here in the UK and I hadn't turned on my house heating yet so I don't think the little tank heater could keep up. Now our heating is on and he's fine. I hadn't thought about temp because all the other fish were doing fine and Rupert is in his old age so I just assumed it was his time.</TEXT>

        <TITLE>I'm shocked at how often people question the validity of his meltdown videos and the like</TITLE>
        <DATE>2019-12-10 00:22:28</DATE>
        <TEXT>on here, YT, Tumblr and the entire anti-ogre community. They are not real. He is not trying to pass them off as real. He is not trying to tap into your empathy so we stop chasing him, he is not trying to document a fake dive into insanity for the courts, he doesn't think he's the Joker. Kai is not divorcing him, he's not living in a box, he doesn't really pour various drinks over himself when he gets up but most importantly of all - **he's not trying to convince us of those things either**. He is *playing a character* he thinks will get the most views and is being very, purposefully, transparent that **it is a character**. Basically - "They want to see a meltdown? I'll give them a meltdown" I'm not saying that these videos aren't worth dissecting, there are some small, interesting windows into the real gregorz but we are wasting time and effort discussing the validity of his "dissolution of marriage" documents and giving him exactly what he wants. He is laughing at us and that makes me sick. Imagine you make a parody video(s) directed towards your haters and critics, and they take it as real, mock you for it and dissect the shit out of it. Wouldn't you laugh your fucking ass off? Wouldn't you feel satisfied that you "tricked" your haters? Personally, I would make it a game to see how much I could get them to believe and that's exactly what he's doing. He's not the smartest man in the world (else he wouldn't be in this mess), but he's smarter than a lot of us give him credit for, and you shouldn't underestimate him. Onision is a character. Greg/James is a predator, racist, abuser, misogynist, tax evader and potential sociopath.</TEXT>

        <TEXT> gt; I don't get who he thinks he's fooling or believes these meltdowns are real A lot of people! That's the problem. Right now on this sub there's a sticky saying his dissolution papers are fake and the OP of that thread said he's trying to pass it off as real. We shouldn't need a sticky for that! I've seen Repzion and other youtubers following this drama genuinely call him out or tease him for things in his videos that are clearly parody or not meant to be taken as real.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yeah, I think the start of the first meltdown video after his patreon got shut down was real and then he realised the mask was slipping so he turned into the joker. He HAD to respond to it because he thrives on any type of attention, but the only way to protect his real personality from criticism was to use his crazy/joker character. I believe that he feels very similarly to what he tells us, but he says it through a filter of deniability so that any criticism he receives, he can tell himself that we're attacking his made up characters, not his actual self.</TEXT>

I understand the stickies are good for consolidating similar topics into one thread but I think it's upsetting that we *need* that sticky. It should be obvious that it's all fake. It **is** obvious but we're still trying to figure out what's real and what's not. None of it is, and he's not trying to pretend it is.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I only heard of him a few months ago, don't worry! But oh boy, I hope you have a bucket of popcorn and no plans for the evening. Dive into youtube, just type in "Onision" and you'll get loadsssssss. My favourites are STRANGE  #198;ONS, CreepShow Art and READY TO GLARE but Repzion has been sort of the face of movement against him (I personally don't really like Repzion but I respect him for what he's done to bring this all to light.) He definitely gives out school shooter vibes but I do think if he was gonna do that, he would have done it by now. He most likely does hurt his husband but that's just speculation and tbh, Kai might be just as accountable as him at this point. If it makes you feel better, the internet has got the police to his house multiple times under the suspicion of child abuse and he hasn't been charged so I think the kids are fine. The dog also doesn't look like a dog who fears greg when we see him in videos.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>He's not doing them as himself, he's never done them as himself, Onision has been a character from the banana video and that's really fucking obvious, it's not even hidden under a thin veil, it's right there on the table in front of you, where he put it. Regarding your Vonnegut quote and having his online persona and real life persona intertwined, I completely agree with the sentiment, from another comment I wrote in this thread - "I believe that he feels very similarly to what he tells us, but he says it through a filter of deniability so that any criticism he receives, he can tell himself that we're attacking his made up characters, not his actual self." However, that quote is a bit iffy, because actors are a thing, Jack Gleeson isn't a psychopath, he's actually a really nice person but he played the most hated character on TV extremely well. Why can't greg be an actor too? Also, you can't start a paragraph with "we can't know his inner life" and then make assumptions about his inner life lol. "Trying to claim they are now suddenly a complete false performance is complete wank." Hate to be that person but you have never talked to me before, I am not suddenly claiming anything. This is what I've thought since the first video I saw of him, it's just that this is the first time you've heard my views on the matter so it's completely wank of you to assume otherwise. Just think about it for a moment, do you think someone having a mental breakdown as bad as the perceived one we're watching would sit down and edit those videos? Render them and upload them regularly to youtube (once a day since "wow")? Keep them up? Wouldn't they just record straight to youtube in a flurry of craziness with no editing, at random times and randomly delete some of them? Because they're planned and scripted, because he's found a way to get views and money in a time of desperation and he'll keep doing it until it stops working and he needs to move onto the next gimmick.</TEXT>

When you're in someone else's house you should respect their rules, even if you don't understand or agree with them.

The maid is not a slave and from the sounds of it she's being paid more than your average service worker. When you go out to eat, do you try and help the servers? They're waiting on you too. No because you're used to that, this is just a service you're not used to. If you can't help feeling guilty, tidy up your own mess *before* she comes round, but keep in mind that if she's hourly you may be taking her wages away from her, which makes you feel more guilty?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Different communities dude. If you google Stardew questions you either get the wiki or this subreddit, because this sub is the biggest Stardew community so it stands to reason that this is the best place to ask questions. Also, this community is known for it's niceness so that's why you got downvoted for being standoffish. Moreover, this is a casual question with a simple answer. Problems that arise when building PCs are either very common and simple, having been answered a million times all over the internet or specific and complicated, making it a chore for the people replying to answer. It would be quicker and easier for everyone for you to google your problem, and you'll probably get a better, more in depth response somewhere off Reddit. Reddit isn't bad for PC help but there are better resources and forums out there. On top of that, it's a joke in the IT/PC community that we're not actually better at PCs than other people, we just know how to use google correctly, so when you come to that community with something that is better answered by google, you're going to get that response. What you've done here, is a kin to sitting in a chemistry class and giving a maths answer, and when told it's wrong saying "but it was the right answer in maths!". Same building (same website), different class (different sub/community).</TEXT>

        <TEXT>When it was just Greg and Josh it was obviously Greg. When Nathaniel was still a dick and they planned to ruin Josh's life and family, it was still Greg, even though he wasn't around. After Nathaniel worked on becoming a better person, their relationship was the healthiest Becca had ever been in. She didn't obsess over him or get clingly and stalky. She learned to say no when she needed to focus on herself and Nathaniel learned that that isn't a knock to his ego or about him but something she needs to do for herself. They both come from a well off family that didn't give them any choice in how they would grow up or what careers they would have. I think they understood each other the most. I love Greg, I would choose him for myself out of all of them (sarcastic alcoholic Greg and new and improved Greg) but if he ever sang "settle for me" to me that would be it. He was irrationally obsessed with her, just like she was with Josh and it was weird. Heather and Hector are cute together, I have no issues with them but I think Heather and Greg made a much better couple. So, yeah, I agree. Becca and Nathaniel. Heather and Greg. Josh and his new GF. Val and Beth were perfect. I still stan WiJo and Darryl even though I know they wanted different things.</TEXT>

        <TEXT> gt; I don #8217;t think being in VR added anything to the game I have to hard disagree with this. I watched some game play footage before I decided to buy it and when I put the headset on I was blown away more than I could imagine. I might be overzealous because the world they created (especially the world in the fairy portals) looked almost exactly like my own made up "happy place", but I feel like being in VR really put you in the game as The Reader. I felt like a part of the story in no way I've experienced before. And how can you pet Quill and give her high fives with your real hand if not in VR? Those moments made me warm inside and I don't think you could create that in pancake mode. But, as a disclaimer, I did get my Oculus this Christmas so I'm not well versed on VR games yet.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Not a vet so do your own research and talk to your vet and do not take my words as gospel but here are some things to consider: Do you know if they were properly weaned before you took them? Have you tried different brands and types of food? (They should be on a mix of wet and dry if they are not drinking) Do you have a pet fountain or a water bowl? (Moving water encourages cats to drink, hence why you see so many cats drinking from dripping taps) Have you tried feliway or other pheromone products? How do they take the syringe milk? Is it a struggle or do they take it easily? Do you have any lilies or other poisonous plants in your house? Have they been wormed? Do you smoke, vape, light incense, use oil diffuses, spray air fresheners regularly? The fact that they are going to the toilet properly is good news.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm with you. Sheldon had no idea what "coffee" means and he simply saw the comic book guy and started talking about comic books. To me, that whole scene was about how oblivious Stuart is to "normal dating language" as well as Sheldon. And the whole Penny dating Stuart thing was to show us, the audience, that she's not really over Leonard or that being with Leonard changed her standards in men - she's not gone back to her usual jocks, she needs something more now that she's been with a smart/geeky guy (but she couldn't pick from the main friend group so she went to literally the only other male geek she knows.) Moreover, Sheldon constantly complains about Penny being in their lives too much when she's with Leonard. He tries to train her out of habits he finds annoying and when they are fake back together for Penny's Dad he says "oh no, not this again!". Obviously, Penny and Sheldon have a special, weird bond but that doesn't become apparent til much later in the show, definitely not when Penny and Leonard are still doing the "will they won't they" crap, that drove Sheldon mad.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-01-07 16:51:34</DATE>
        <TEXT>I've tried google but it doesn't really come up with what I need. It's a lot of "first time" scenes and about discussing limits and such, or for Doms that have more than one partner and have a schedule. I'm looking for something for a monogamous couple that are into BDSM and already know what each other's limits and likes are. Me (f/sub) and my SO (m/Dom) have a few issues surrounding sex and the BDSM side really boils down to his confidence, or lack there of, in it all and himself. Pretty much that he's not sure what do to next, second guessing himself and not being able to think on his feet because of it. This obviously brings it full circle and (in his mind) validates his lack of confidence. I thought that planning the scene together beforehand might help. Then he doesn't have to think on his feet or second guess himself because it's all already agreed on. It might take some of the surprise and anticipation away for me but that's an easy trade off to build his confidence. I just don't know where we would start! The most we've ever planned is what I'm gonna wear and that we're gonna have a scene.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>No this is crap. That comment's conclusion is based on the assumption that the snake was burned where the picture is taken (no scorch marks on the ground). Why would a snake lay her eggs on what looks like a road? Pretty sure that's a car in the top right. And if it's not a road, why would she lay them on asphalt, in the open? And if someone moved the eggs to the road how did they get the eggs if she was protecting them? And why did they stack them neatly? If she wasn't near the eggs when they were stolen, how did she find them before they were set on fire? Why would she have left her eggs unprotected? Snakes eat like once a fortnight (depending on species) it's not like she has to go out hunting every day. The "clear signs of an accelerant" are not clearly an accelerant at all. It wouldn't be in a neat puddle just to the side of the snake, there would be splash marks and it would be all around the snake. Also, I'm not an expert on accelerants but wouldn't it have burned up by the time the snake is dead? And, it has lumps in it. Look at her tail, it's cut off. The "accelerant" is her innards falling out.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I have to say that you're missing another criteria when it comes to gifts. It's not just "I appreciate the intent/meaning" vs "I appreciate the money spent" there's also "I appreciate the thought behind it." If my SO had gotten me a very expensive engagement ring I still have the potential to be upset with it. Yes he has good intentions, yes he spent the money, but what if it is completely not my style or inline with my likes. This would make me feel like he doesn't know me or that he didn't take the time to get something _I_ would like. Equally, if my SO bought me something cheap for no reason, there's no intention or meaning, there's no money but I still have the potential to be thrilled with it if it was totally something I would love. Relaying to OP's story, it seems the only thought he put into it was how much he could spend. This item is meant to be worn 24/7 and there is nowhere in the world where a $7 necklace won't go green within a few days of wear. So ultimately, he's bought something useless. I would be upset too, not because of the price, because he didn't think about the meaning behind the collar and thus usage of it. It would have been better if he got some jewellery cord (which is even cheaper) and given her that, because at least that will last. She still reacted badly though, if this was an AITA post I'd be voting ESH.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Do you know how many different types of pet combs/brushes there are? I have [one of these](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Brush-Extra-Soft-Silicone-Pins/dp/B0711YC3Y3), [one of these](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/FURminator-Undercoat-deShedding-Small-Under/dp/B07NSP74M6/), [one of these](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Bahob%C2%AE-Grooming-Double-Groomer-Massage/dp/B0856V56JP) and [one of these](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/KW-SMART-Slicker-Brush-Small/dp/B00P27KDNA). Only the latter would suck on their bellies, but only maybe because having fur totally changes the feel of a brush. Take a hair brush (if you're not bald) and run it over your head, then run the same one over your skin - very different sensation. The point is, cats only let you touch their bellies when they totally trust you and are totally relaxed, and they don't totally trust the brush and they'll either be excited or anxious if they're getting a maintenance brush. It has practically nothing to do with how it feels.</TEXT>

        <TITLE>I have a question about releasing or sweeping away negative energy.</TITLE>
        <DATE>2020-05-22 12:16:06</DATE>
        <TEXT>Okay so disclaimer, I'm not even a baby witch, I'm still in the research and questioning phase (as if that ever ends lol) so please forgive any ignorance or any faux-pas. So, to the extent of my knowledge, a lot of spells and rituals always start with a cleansing of negative or stale energy in the space you're going to work. This makes perfect sense to me, you wouldn't start painting on an unprepped canvas, you wouldn't start cooking on a dirty chopping board. Where I get a bit confused is when I start to think where that energy is going. A lot of what I've read is basically, if you're inside, leave a window open at least an inch so the negative energy has somewhere to go. But then, you're literally and figuratively putting negative energy out into the world. It has to go somewhere, energy is cyclical, transferable, you can't create or destroy it. So then I thought, maybe I could trap it and bury it. But eventually, everything degrades and returns and the receptacle would start leaking negative energy straight into Mother Earth. Which I really don't feel comfortable doing. Then I thought, what if I just trap it and don't bury it? I'd end up with a room full of jars full of negative energy and I don't think I could handle that spiritually, not at the moment anyway. So I'm just looking for insights and maybe to open up a discussion about this. Is there a way to turn negative energy into positive? Is there a place we can "banish" it to that won't cause harm? Where does it go?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I like this a lot and I do agree that energy can be stale and neutral. I kind of wish I could see it this way because I think it would make it a lot easier for me to reconcile but I definitely subscribe to dualism. I don't think you can have good without evil, light without dark, positive without negative, else it wouldn't be positivity, it would just be varying degrees of neutral. I've also experienced too much negativity to deny its existence. I have a lot of negative inside myself and it would be unwise of me, I think, to ignore it, I've been doing that most my life and it's only given it room to fester and grow. I need to confront it and move it on. You've given me a lot of food for thought though, and I thank you for that. I really like your water analogy, that makes a lot of sense to me. Maybe one day I can fit these two *things* together.</TEXT>

Thank you, this is kind of the "missing puzzle piece".  gt; When you're cleansing you should be putting lots of positive vibes and thoughts out which will also somewhat escape with the negative energy Is there something I could do while cleansing to really push this? Like an extra step or moment or mini ritual? Or maybe something at the end to thank Mother Nature *specifically* for cleaning/soaking up/helping me rid my area of negative energy?</TEXT>

It's seen as cruel to keep cats indoors here unless there's health or safety reasons. My fluff is fully vaccinated, insured, spayed and microchipped.

        <TEXT>Thank you! She is really pretty and she bloody well knows it! I wouldn't say I was a *fan* (yet) but I like youtube and she's one of the first witchy youtubers I've found. I like the way she thinks and sees the world and how she approaches witchcraft and wicca, it makes sense to me, so far at least. Also, she's British!</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Strap in, I wrote an essay :'D Well, she's been an outdoor cat since she was old enough and had her relevant vaccinations so in that respect she's used to being outdoors. Cats have territories and circuits and they don't wonder as far as you think (especially female cats and neutered males). When you move house with a cat (or adopt one), you keep them inside for minimum 2 weeks so they get used to the new smells, get comfortable with the house and recognise it as "home" and know where food is. Then you slowly introduce them to outside. 5 minutes the first day, stay with them. Follow them, show them the way back, use lots of treats to encourage them to stay close. Next day, 10 minutes. Keep doing this until you feel comfortable that they are comfortable. Once you start letting them out on their own, give them treats and/or loves and cuddles as soon as they come home so they associate coming home with good feelings. It's important that YOU become their home. I've moved house with Keiko (cat in the picture) three times, so she's had 4 different areas to get used to, but because *I'm* the constant, it's me she comes back to, and she just knows that I'll be in the house. Does that make sense? The most important thing though, is trust and love. If your cat trusts and loves you, s/he won't run away (that's not to say that they won't get lost, I'm not saying everyone who's lost a cat this way didn't have a loving relationship with their cat. If a cat is on their regular rounds and something unusual spooks them, they might run away to somewhere they don't know and then get lost). Disclaimer though, I have never had an indoor cat. The closest I came was adopting an 8 month old who had lived in a high-rise and never been outside, but they're still children/teenagers at that age and still learning so I don't see it as much different from training a kitten. So I say this for kittens and older cats that are already used to outside, I couldn't talk on indoor cats and I wouldn't feel comfortable giving advice on them either. I hope this helps! Please please, if you intend to introduce your cat to outside do way more research. Make sure your area is safe! We always make sure we move to houses by slow and quiet roads. If I lived in a country that had coyotes, bears, eagles and rabies, I wouldn't let them out and instead, focus on enriching inside!</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm glad you embraced his nature :) have you thought about a microchip? I'm not sure what they cost there but they're about  #163;10 here. If he gets lost and someone finds him (and he doesn't have or has lost his collar) any vet can scan it and his number will go on the database. If you've got your contact details connected to that database and his chip number, they can contact you! But again, this is the UK, I don't know what your infrastructure is like over there for this kind of thing.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Are you a troll? Or completely missing the irony of what you just said? You are rationalising it by supporting this industry. This is what they do, this is what they've always done, and worse. There's been no "humane" meat industry since people kept and raised their own animals (if we completely ignore the fact that killing isn't humane). What else are they do to when millions of animals get sick and not fit for human consumption? What else are they do to when workers aren't allowed to come in to "look after" the animals? If you run any kind of business with products that have an expiry date or potential to get contaminated, when that happens, you have to destroy your stock. And sickness in animals is inevitable. It's a necessary evil **to keep the industry running**. The only way to get rid of this evil is to get rid of the industry that births it.</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-06-12 02:00:07</DATE>
        <TEXT>I'll try to keep this short but I know that ain't happening so apologies in advance. I'm not on a t-break, that's just an added bonus. I'm trying to break the habit. I've smoked every day for at least 8 years, the 4 years before that, it was a social thing. I used to smoke during the day and be able to do shit and go outside, but for the last ~ 3 years I have to have all my shit done (or give in to procrastination) and know I'm not leaving the house for the rest of the day. Unsurprisingly, my anxiety has gotten worse and I developed agoraphobia in these years. It's not all because of weed but it certainly didn't help. I have to hand it to the little green plant though, it turned my depression from manic to manageable (I know, I'm a walking stereotype lol). The longest I've gone without it in these 8 years is 2  amp; 1/2 weeks because I was on holiday and couldn't get my hands on any but as soon as I came home it was back to normal. Tonight marks exactly 2 weeks since my last joint and other than gaining my appetite back yesterday, I don't feel different. I've had a depressive episode this week but I've chalked that up to the state of the world, my period and finding the perfect house but covid saying lol no (look it up, mortgage lenders in the UK have all pulled 95% and 90% loans because they anticipate the market dropping and lord knows millennial first time buyers don't deserve to get on the property ladder, even though the house we're going for is the same price it was in December nshanejakxisnens). Anyway, I'm gagging for a spliff and I'm thinking maybe this weekend, especially if we finally get a mortgage approved tomorrow, and I wouldn't buy weight, just enough for a couple nights. It's not like we can afford more than that right now anyway, we have our deposit together but still need money for solicitor fees and shit. But then I'm thinking that I'm just kidding myself and making excuses. Last time I tried to break the habit, I did the same thing, had some at the weekend, didn't have any for a few more days and then fell right back in. But I don't want to quit quit, I love weed. There's nothing like getting high, playing video games and ordering a pizza. A spliff after sex is one of the best simple pleasures in life. Lying in the grass and looking up at the stars through red eyes is just not something I'm willing to never experience again. I want to practice moderation. Don't they say it takes 11 days to make or break a habit? Is 15 days enough or should I go for at least 28? The amount of time they say it takes for THC to leave your system. I just want some input from people who understand. My SO doesn't smoke it at all and would happily encourage me to never smoke again, I love him but he just doesn't have the relationship with it that we do, and my sister has her own struggles with it. If I don't reply tonight, it's because I managed to get to sleep, but I thank you for reading this far and any input you have x</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Haha one time the police climbed through my window when we were out (my boyfriend had been talking to me through said window and it must have looked shady to some neighbours because it was dark, he had his hood up and they couldn't see me). The cops left a note explaining what had happened and why there were foot prints on the bed. They left it right next to my rolling tray, the cheeky bastards. Thank God I didn't buy weight back then and only 10s or 20s.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Lol! Nah, our bedroom is really small, there's about a foot between the window and my side of the bed, small enough for me but not a cop in full gear. The note just explained the situation, that a neighbor had seen a hooded man leaning into our open window and rang them. They couldn't get in the front door (because we weren't in) so they came in the window but nothing seemed to be stolen or messed up so they assumed it was fine. They left a number incase it wasn't fine, nothing about the weed though! But they made it known they'd seen it and let me off lol</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Wow, I did not get that at all. In the flash back I saw it as Crystal being selfish and trying to justify it as "look how cool I'm being about all these things, you should keep your penis for me". I was shouting at the screen "you can't ask her to do that! It's her body! Get a dildo!". Crystal does moan about how hard it is on everyone but I think that's a very real reaction and wasn't the show saying "look how being trans affects those around you." The reality is that trans people do get unfairly shit on for being trans, and the show showed that. And I didn't see Sophia being vilified for sneaking in her HRT either, I saw that plot line as emphasizing how far Crystal had come in acceptance and love for her now wife, and how she was willing to break the law to help Sophia stay her true self.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm probably misremembering the HRT story line, I though Crystal refused at first but then gave in when she realised how important it was. So in that case, my bad and I understand what you're saying about that plot line not even being necessary. I also see what you're saying about the ambiguities in the portrayal of Sophia's struggles, I'm LGBTQ+, and surrounded by allies and other LGBTQ+ people, but cis so I saw it through my viewpoint of understanding/empathy but not personal experience. The show definitely could have done more to say that while Crystal's (and everyone Sophia interacted with) experiences and reactions were realistic, they were not okay.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>You should definitely tell your brother first and ask him how he would like it handled. As that seems to be off the cards, you don't need to lie, but you don't have to tell the whole truth either. If both your partners identify the same way you could just say "I'm going to see my boyfriend and spend the night, I'll see you tomorrow!" or girlfriend. If not, just say partner. If they ask for a name, which I highly doubt at that age, say the name of the person you're seeing that evening and they will just assume you're going to see them every time. No lies told.</TEXT>

There are allergy wipes that you can get from any pet store. I bought them for my cat who's allergic to everything, thinking they would wipe the allergens off his skin/fur but they're actually to wipe allergens off the dog/cat for humans who are allergic. You could try these prior to the wedding and see if they work for you, her and her dog.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>He made a documentary with/about Jeffery Starr and during this time Jeffery manufactured drama about James Charles (keep in mind James was 19 at the time and these two are 30+ year olds) implying that he was a predator but never showed receipts. James lost A LOT of followers because of this. Shane did nothing to stop it and receipts have come out showing him and Jeffery laughing about it and planning it. Somehow, another beauty Youtuber called Tati was involved. She basically broke the "story" and started it all. In fairness to her, her gripe was with some sponsorship James wasn't doing for her and she never called him a predator, just that he hit on straight men far too often. Jeffery ran with this and started calling him a predator and alluding to having evidence but wouldn't release it to "protect Jame's victims" that's an actual quote of his. Jeffery and Shane egged Tati on to release that video so they wouldn't get the flack for it. It was all to drum up interest in the documentary. During the run up to the release, they made it seem like the drama would be addressed, true documentary style. Surprise, it wasn't, just their reactions to Tati's videos and James' follower decline. Jeffery is in "trouble" again because of his involvement with Davie Vanity. So all this is coming back up again: "how can you call James a predator and not release receipts when there's video evidence of you being friends with a known predator". So Shane is also getting flack for his involvement. He recently released a statement saying he was leaving the beauty world and that beauty gurus are all just in it for the drama. The statement was pathetic, it was all "woah is me, I'm too sensitive for this shit. Jeffery has some growing to do but I still love him. James needed a slice of humble pie." TLDR; he started drama with Jeffery against James and couldn't take the backlash, so "left" the beauty community. Even though he was never into make up and just released a pallet with Jeffery for the money lol. I hate that I know all this. So much brain space wasted. I watch far too much youtube.</TEXT>

I'm not a writer but I do have some CC. This is personal opinion, of course.  gt;In front of us, a demon no higher than 2 ft and purple rubbery skin gazed at us with vibrant yellow eyes and two horns on top of his head. The _ands_ in this sentence don't seem to fit. If you take away the statements before the ands, it doesn't make sense;  gt;a demon no higher than purple rubbery skin. and;  gt;gazed at us with two horns on top of his head. I know he's not looking at us through his horns but it's written that way. I would rewrite it to something of this effect;  gt;In front of us a demon, no higher than 2ft with rubbery purple skin and two stubby horns twisting out of [the top of] his head, gazed at us through vibrant yellow eyes. This is nitpicking but in the dialogue right below Orlox's introduction, you have two _saids_ in a row. It doesn't really matter but I would change "Orlox said with a handsome..." to "Orlox teased with a handsome..." or even forgo any verbs and just describe his voice straight after the dialogue. We already know it's Orlox speaking because Raven just addressed him and Marla doesn't speak like that.  gt;"It's a bit early, fer ya, innit'?" His voice was handsome, smooth, like a radio broadcaster. I hope this wasn't too much, I only typed it all out because I really like what you're writing, and again, it's only my personal preference!</TEXT>

          <TEXT>When people don't like or agree with something he's said they will always pull up that he doesn't have any credentials to be a judge further than being a camp gay man. Personally, I don't agree with everything he says but I like it when he disagrees with Michelle because it seems like noone else, except the ballsiest guest judge, will. Michelle's tastes are too old-school for me, she doesn't really allow "people before their time" to be themselves and only accepts a new wave when it's already a trend. She wants people to be Ru-style drag without outshining Ru. Ross is a bit more up to date and open minded (but I'll never forgive him for calling Shea's 3-in-1 crafty). He very much judges on his own personal opinion, from his heart, rather than objectively, so a lot of people/fans end up disagreeing with him. Which is fine, we all have opinions but as a judge you should be more objective. Ross is also hilarious when he helps/directs/improvs with the girls in maxi challenges. But I think people are just bored of him because he's always there, whereas Carson is only there 60% of the time.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>It's a really weird question. What's the point or purpose of any life? There is none, really, except to make more life. People say ants airate the soil and bees pollinate the flowers so people don't needlessly kill them but the bees arent pollinating flowers to keep flowers alive, they're using the nectar to keep their hive going and ants don't dig tunnels to airate the soil, they do it to have somewhere to live. Everything serves itself, even if it benefits something else or has symbiosis with another species. This is how eco systems develope, around the creatures and plants in it, and then new animals and species will evolve and develop to fit into it. If they dont, they die, or if they dont die (ie when humans interfere), the ecosystem gets screwed up.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>It depends _why_ imo. But, as others have said, cutting out wheat won't see many benefits unless you're a celiac, where as cutting out dairy will. Also, veganism is good for the environment and animals. If you're cutting out eggs as well, make sure you find some good protein replacements :) but there's loads of man made and natural protein rich foods that we're not necessarily exposed to regularly (depending on culture/location ofc).</TEXT>

          <TEXT>OP, idk if you're reading these anymore but over both threads you're being told to sell/give away your goldfish and get a betta because of the size of your tank. Bettas come with their own set of issues and while they will do okay in a 5gal/20L tank, bigger is always better. "But they live in puddles!" people will cry. Wrong, they live in rice paddies, they like shallow, sure, but that's very easily over come with putting things close to the surface that they can rest on. You can just search "betta hammock" and "betta floating log". No matter the size of your tank, they should have these things available anyway. You must not put two male bettas together under any circumstances. You can have a community of female bettas (but not in 20L). You can sometimes get away with having one male and a group of females in a very large tank but this is difficult and usually only breeders will do this (and often they will only keep the male in there when they want them to mate). Bettas have personalities (most fish do but it's more apparent with bettas) for instance, my SO had a betta with shrimp in his tank whereas my betta would eat shrimp. He couldn't keep other fish with his but I could have small tetras. If you want other fish with you betta you should only keep fish they will not mistake for another betta. IE, no frilly or brightly coloured fish, so guppies are out but ember tetras might be okay. Again, I say might because all bettas are different. On the flip side, you can't keep any fin nippers with bettas as bettas are very frilly! So no barbs ect. However, I wouldn't put any fish in with a betta if you only have a 20L. IMO, the only thing 20L tanks are good for is a quarantine/hospital tank. Bettas need a heater. You need to be careful about what decorations and plants you put in your tank as previously stated, bettas are very frilly and have delicate fins. Silk or real plants only, smooth substrate and ornaments. A good rule of thumb for testing decorations for bettas is to take a pair of 40 denier or thinner tights/stockings (the ones you can see through) and run it along the decoration's surface. If it snags then it's too rough for your betta. They also need stimulation and interaction, you can get a floating mirror ball (but never leave it for more than 20mins at a time!) or teach them tricks. Talk to them! I'm not joking, they will recognise you. So to wrap up, overall I would take that tank back and get a bigger one. Also find another LFS that doesn't tell you lies for money. If you don't wish to do that but still want fish, give away your goldfish and get ONE betta and nothing else and make sure the tank is heated and cycled (get a water perimeter kit! Most of us use API but you can get dip sticks too, not as accurate but infinitely easier and less hassle). Good luck.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>You're welcome :) People are being particularly nasty to you in the /r/fishtank sub, try not to take it to heart. They forget that they were new fish keepers once too. I would have made the same mistakes had I not been lucky and gone to a decent LFS my first time. Media teaches us that fish are easy pets and it's not until you get into it that you realise there's so much to it. It's not like you don't already feel horrible, there's no need for them to pile on.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Is there new drama or are you talking about the whole Chris selling the rights thing? If I'm up to date, I'm on Chris's side. He explained very clearly his reasons and they were very... reasonable and nothing like Repzion was making it out to be. Thing is, Hanson has been doing this for a long time _but_ what people fail to realise is that before now, he had a whole team of people behind him. It's got to be difficult to go from that to running the show yourself on a platform you're not familiar with, with a handful of people. He's bound to make mistakes but I believe his heart is truly in the right place. Repzion, well, I've not liked him for a long time so I might be biased but I don't think he cares as much as he says. I do think his anger is real because anyone with an iota of empathy would be angry with onion boy. Even if Hanson made some mistakes, they are negligible compared to grug and banding together is a much better tactic than attacking one another. But Repizon loves drama, it's what gets him the most views. Most of his YouTube money comes from his videos about smeg but then Greg didn't post much so Repzion didnt have much to post so he turned on Chris. And come to think of it, Repzion isn't as critical thinking as he thinks he is. He's bought into onion soup's shit far too often and reported it as fact, which is another reason I don't really take any stock in what he says.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>This is really interesting! I'm thinking maybe a mutation or cross breed, because while he's definitely some kind of tetra, I've never seen or heard of a translucent one without any other markings. He's defo not an ember because he's much bigger and a different shape. He looks the right shape and size to be a bloodfin but he doesn't have any red on his tail. Like someone else said, he could be young. Could be a glow light tetra if he has a faint orange line along the length of his body? But again, his shape is a bit off I think. I don't think there's any need to take him back, he seems to be schooling with the embers and your beta won't see him as a threat.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Honestly, I've thought about this a lot because I am bi/pan and I think it's for a number of reasons. We can "stealth" for lack of a better term, and don't _have_ to come out until we have our first same/similar gender relationship. We don't necessarily face as much bigotry from the wider society (as long as we're in a hetro relationship). They probably see this as us suffering less and undeserving of solidarity. (Please know when I'm saying "them" I mean biphobes and not gays) From my personal experience and observations, we end up in hetro relationships more often than not. They could perceive this as us faking for attention or to infiltrate the LGBTQ+ community. I think what they fail to realise is that our dating pool is 95% straight wo/men and 5% gay/bi wo/men and enbies, so of course we're more likely to fall into a hetro one on average, it's just numbers. And then there's the phenomenon of racist, transphobic and misogynistic gay people. Being gay doesn't automatically make you empathetic unfortunately, even though they struggle from the same bigotry from the same type of people.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Just gonna reiterate that there's no reason to have them on the same layer, in fact it would be detrimental for you to do that. It's good practice to keep everything separate. Have the face layer above the river layer. Mask the face layer (Right click on the layer in the layer panel  gt; create layer mask) Make sure the mask is selected and not the layer in the layer panel. It will be to the right of the layer thumbnail in the layer panel. Take a big soft black brush (turn down hardness) and start painting on the mask (in the image) where you want to "erase" the face layer. If you don't like what you've done you simply make the brush white and paint it back in.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>Lovely viewing. Things to add interest - driftwood, rocks/stones/crystals, floating plants, moss balls, an air stone (you don't need it for oxygen as your filter is disturbing the top of the water enough but I think they look pretty cool) and maybe some little tetras - embers, for example, for a splash of colour and to bring a bit more life to the middle of the tank, and they're tiny.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>You've already got some good advice but I'd like to give you a bit more. Bacteria in a bottle is usually just snake oil. I don't know if the particular brand you were recommended works but I've never had luck with it or know anyone that has. You should google "Fish-in cycle" to get more information about cycling a tank with fish in. It is possible, don't panic. You will have to be doing water changes much more regularly than normal until the tank is fully cycled. You will want to get a water perimeter test kit. Most of us use "API master test kit". This will be particularly needed during your cycle phase but you'll use it normally too. If it seems overwhelming, you can also buy dip sticks, but they're not as reliable. Your water surface doesn't seem very disturbed. Oxygen gets into water when the water surface is disturbed enough, when the water tension is broken. Often, a HOB (hang on the back) filter or a powerful flow is enough but an air stone is a cheaper alternative to buying a new filter (also they look cool). If you don't already, you'll want to get a "gravel vacuum". This facilitates water changes while also sucking up poop and uneaten food from the gravel. Don't overfeed your fish. It's not that they'll get fat, the uneaten food adds to the organic matter breaking down, resulting in more ammonia. Watch how much they eat and adjust how much you put in. You can get sinking food pellets. Also, when you add flakes, break them up first, just by rubbing them in between your fingers. this will make them float for less time (and makes it easier for your fish to eat them). Planted tanks are much better all round for fish keeping but it's going to be very tricky to grow them in just gravel and is a whole other kettle of fish. Get your tank cycled and your fish happy and come back to us. The fake plants you have now seem fine for the fish's sake.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>You're welcome :). Your gravel is fine for the fish and easier to keep clean than sand or soil. If you do want to buy something more natural, make sure you get it from a pet shop and not a garden centre as it'll definitely be safe for the fish that way.</TEXT>

Ray and Bob didn't like me, didn't think I was worthy of being a vampire but Mikey was like my bff, so him and Frank had to try and convince them. Gerard was indifferent, too busy writing music and saving all of vampire kind from the evil humans. Wow I've not thought about that in a long time.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>You could try chalks! They wash out in one wash, people use them for festivals/weekend events or kids who cant have coloured hair at school. They're cool cause it's easy to do sections or streaks. And then if you like the look you could try a vegetable dye in the same colour. Vegetable dyes are really kind to your hair and they're semi permanent by nature. If you do try some vegetable dyes some tips: To top up your colour when it's fading, add a bit of the dye to your conditioner. If you want the colour to fade quicker, use a cleansing or dandruff shampoo.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>I'm pretty sure it's an Au Ra actually, which already have 3D models. So my point still stands, it is not the fault of the artist as they are copying pre-existing models. Your gripe is with Square Enix designers, not this artist.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>I never said you were wrong or argued with that point, I simply said that you were blaming the wrong person  gt;What I do find unreasonable about this is that _the artist_ has not taken into account... We're on a post about this particular piece of art, not the Au Ra model in general. _This_ artist got it pretty spot on and I think it's unfair to call them out on someone else's design  #175;\\\_( #12484;)\_/ #175;</TEXT>

          <TEXT>From the comments she says Mac cost her $12000! The breeders/trainers were very kind and only charged her $5500 for Whiskey. But either way, she was $17500 out of pocket because Aunt doesn't know how/doesn't bother training her dog.</TEXT>

          <TEXT>I'm totally with your partner. I'm used to communicating with computers with my fingers and communicating with people with my voice. I don't want to talk to a computer and have it talk back to me, I find it creepy and dystopian, very uncanny valley vibes. BUT I do want to set up routines and automations and scenes and check if I left my lights on and turn them off remotely, dim my switches without getting off my lazy ass, with a few touches of a button/touch screen.</TEXT>
