    <TEXT>honestly; from a gamer to a gamer And not to be the " black sheep " or what so ever... i don't reccomend buy this game at all... or at least not in this state. Cheaters, toxic community ( exept the reddit one ) lack of contents right now, and cosmetic system ( if you don't care, that might not be a problem ) with the balancing system it's quite a mess. so if you are really going to buy this game, i might suggest to wait for the next pacfic update REVIEWS. because to be honest, like me and many others people that was there from the beginnig, they managed to fucked up many times and many things that were supposed to be fixed with the new stuff. so, yeah, look from streamers and youtubers in what's current states it's bfv. and than you will decide it to buy it or nah. just be sure of what you are going to waste money on.  #8203; comparing to swb2, it's a night mare. total different game.  #8203; don't get me wrong, bfv it's funny sometimes especially with friends... but the gameplay experience it's very frustrating in many occasion. for campers, unbalanced weapons and many others thing. this is my opinion. from what i experienced and played. so take it with a grain of salt. but i wouldn't lie. last thing, don't buy the deluxe edition. it doesn't give you anything rather than ugly and common cosmetic. anyway, cheers!.</TEXT>

( which, i'm not an historian, but it shouldn't. ) the other day while i was playing, i saw an halftruck, more precisly sdk.fz 251, the german one ( stoled by some british soldier). since i was a medic, i thought to take it down with the cannon. \*First Shell\*; missed\*Second Shell\*; managed to bounce in the hull of the side track. ( ok? )\*Third Shell\*; only 20 dmg. seriously? not to mention that a staghound suddendly appeard and he insta killed me after surviving 2 shells... They Need A Big Buff.

(exept mfs ramming you while you are turning) - high levels showing how much rich they are ( or showing their modded account ) which after all, they are harmless. - pvp players at high levels they exist. playing every game mode. and grinders even if rich, they still make money. i guess for helping their friends?

    <TEXT>Bf4 Customization On The Mrap Was Gorgeous. We Should Also Get The Possibility To Upgrade Halftrucks In BFV; Like Put Smokes, Change Weapons, Change Skin, Ecc. That Would Include More Skins, More MicroTransations, And A Bit Of Grinding. Because Right Now, Feels Like Halftrucks Are Useless. And Maybe Remove The Reinforcement Halftrucks And Put them As Tank Section Like The Staghound And Maybe Reused That Teased Sdk.fz Stuka.... Am i The Only Thinking This?

You Don't Wan't Make Swastikas? Totally Fine. replace them with Iron Crosses as they already did on some "nazis" clothes. regarding on what dice did ( and it's doing), it's totally wrong, because they taked the " authenticity they promised " and they throwed away somewhere putting out these bullshits non sense in what so ever with ww2 settings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well, griefer or not, mk2 its the rappresentation of what is everything wrong in gta v. it's unbalanced. it's too many things. of ot wasn't weaponized. in my opinion was ok. but even there, it's unbalanced. as i keep repeat, it's too many things in one. it's a bike, that can be called as mc, but in the mean while it's like a plane, cuz can fly, and it has one of the best tracking system in the game. and these combination fucked up everything. it's just a toy that makes all others vehicle pointless. like, no need to take any other vehicles anymore rather than the mk2. because it's too easy to do things with it. but that's just me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you don't earn cc anymore by match. But only reaching every new level. this was changed i think in the pacific update or maybe after. just when they increased the general levels. so you should earn 1,5 k every level until 70, after level 70 and plus, you will earn 3k per level. so right now it's more tricky and boring in my opinion. you can still earn by level or do assignments and daily challenges.</TEXT>

(still have to test it) the one that gives cheaper and less effective grenadiers, advanced packs for enginner, ability to hide and shot paraclers for the halftruck and tiger tank. but this just make others problems. ( for cheaper grenadiers. but the rest it's kinda ok. i'll tell you more about once i will try it against russians )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well, there's nothing wrong about it. and it should't be a level to impact your gameplay. maybe they just wanna play with other friends, but they can't due to the new mmr system (ranking system). so they make another account and restart from 0. ( i'm preatty sure it's not that easy nor convenient. you lose all skins, operator and such so...) or maybe the wanna get diamond. again, what's wrong? beating low levels players? just because he is more good than you or has more knowledge of the game? see it as challange to impruve against them. not get frustrated. also, they cause no harm. and even ranked in this game aren't such serious things.a cheers. P.s if you think i'm a smurf just because i defend them, i'm sorry to dissapoint you. but honeslty i don't have time to waste, nor i don't like to lose what i hardly got ( skins, operators, and such.) so i will keep my 0.5 k.d and 1.5 competitive. sorry for my bad english, i hope you will get my point. btw, better smurfs than cheaters for sure...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as you said, we are customers. and it's truee. but as customer, like me and many others, we payed for a functioning product. not a misleading and broken game by a triple A softwerhouse. now i'm not an expert about finacial industries, if you don't listen to your customers, and keep the product bad... i hardly think you will earn money from it. nor convince any others to buy the game. let's be real. butterfield v it's so goddem bad in every aspect. and it's a truth. uniforms not accurate at all, most of the weapons feels like that are some generation of nerf guns while others are too op. cannons at are not working from day 1. same thing for combat tanks system where a scrambling valentine still manage to destroy a tiger one with just a few shells, no matter range. animation in halftrucks are still fucked up even nowdays and also the raggdols. and they still dare to put microtransations in a game like this. dude, are you blind or what? i hope they pay you well for saying such things. reddit it's full of constructive critiques. but devs are only interestred in nice comments regardless the whole mess. ofc never answering about what comes next nor taking care of any suggestion/critiques. i'm preatty sure this comment will get deleted. it's not the first time, and it will never be the last. anyway, sorry for my bad english. and have a good day. cheers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nope, crouchspamming still effective. trust me on that, and yes. i might be a bad person for doing it, but it's a savior sometimes, it depends from your reflex. yes, you get dmg, but most of the time i can end preatty quickly the life of my opponent. dropshotting will not make you able to aim while you're dropping. so you lose much accuracy. you may try it with some small wall or desk for survive.

    <TEXT>that's the utility of the truck it self, like bf1 for the artillery truck, and after all, it wasn't that op. i mean, you could balance the reload time like a bomber, the heavy one, which takes like 15/20 seconds. and you have to go back to refill ammo. but what i meant with this post, is the posibility to customize halftrucks, like remove the reinforce one, and put it as tank. with his own customization and specialization. cheers Danny!. ps. sorry for my bad english and sorry for late answer.

    <DATE>2020-02-08 17:03:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>well, there are multiple wrong things about the combined arms, but, i can say as we should expect more, right now it's kinda  #8220; #8220;ok #8221; #8221;. i mean, basic with many bugs but works, it's good for new players, good for pratice, good for compleate impossible chapter assignment, and earn coins. why not take the shot, and add mission for other factions? like add the pacific? and why not also include some rewards? (like 5v5 cancelled content) such potential. but it also need variety on objective, the tiralleur campain was preatty cool, where advance and fight for the obj. or also sneak behind enemy lines like  #8220;under no flags  #8221; or  #8220; nordlys  #8221; and includes also vehicle. you (dice) managed to rise a game from ashes such battlefront 2. and a really good job with the pve section. but that's just my opinion. for players are gonna say  #8220; bf it's not for pve #8221; you're wrong. just look history.</TEXT>
