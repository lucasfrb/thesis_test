    <DATE>2020-04-24 22:23:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alice was always a little skinny since we got her as a kitten. In October last year we got all our cats spade and she started to gain a little weight and looked very similar to her bigger sister (from the same mom). Recently though shes lost her weight, very rapidly and almost never ate. This morning she had poop stuck to her butt with string attached. My mom was really worried for her and we took her to Avet, an emergency vet service in our area. They found string stuck in her mouth. they said best option was surgery, but that would cost almost 6000 dollars and our family is struggling as is, and was already going to pay for xrays and blood work (870$) my mother was going to receive a settlement from her work which would give us enough money but ut wouldnt come until May 8 and they wanted the money up front. the only other option was cut the string from her mouth and hope it passes through okay. If it doesnt she could die.. we want to do everything we can but we just dont have the money right now for her surgery. If shes still okay and the string hasnt passed by may 8 we are taking her for surgery. we just dont know what would even tempt her to eat a string, or where she would find one that long we took her back home and shes a little tired from being out all day and still not eating. it should take awhile for it to go through if she can make it. thanks for reading, i just need to get it out there i dont have anyone to really tell</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Religion and Laws are supposed to be separate, right?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-16 14:48:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I dont dismiss anyone who believes in God, thats not my thing, but a Christian choosing wether or not abortion is legal because of their religion is totally wrong. You always see Christian/other religious followers protesting abortion. Outside of clinics, on the internet, just being insulting. Its the pregnant person's right to an abortion. Their choice really only effects themselves. Christians on the Internet, who might have not even met the person, or will never meet the person, telling them that their choice is wrong. That they should've just "used a condom" and "abortion makes you a monster" is so wrong. im sure the person who is getting an abortion already feels bad. If someone doesnt want a baby, why should they let a person swallowed by Christian beliefs tell them they can't have an abortion because of what THEY believe in. just imagine, "No, you cant have that meat, you f*cking monster. You are disguting for eating that. I wouldn't want my children to meet you, we only believe in veganism, and that meat youre eating is disgusting" now this, "No, you cant have that abortion, you f*cking monster. You are a murderer for having an abortion. I wouldn't let my children meet you, we are dignified Christians, and you are basically murdering a child" point of this post is, Religion and Laws are supposed to be separate. Not a Christian man telling someone they can't make a decision for their own body who will not effect anyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this was maybe January or February, back when i was in school. it was our lunch period and me and ny friend would walk upstaurs to the bathroom and fuck around cause we never ate school lunch. he was going to the bathroom when another guy walked in. he said, "oh what are you doing" and i said "nothing, just waiting for my friend" and then he came out and we left. when i was sitting in the cafeteria the guidance counselor comes out and says "can you follow me" she sat me down and asked what i said to that boy in the bathroom and i told her. she said "really cause thats not what i heard. he told me you said 'nothing just thinking about ending my life'" and i was shocked because thats nothing close to what i said. she questioned my friends if ive ever had suicidal thoughts. thankfully he said no because i can not deal with therapists bothering me. i planned on talking to the bitch but never got the chance. im still pissed as well as my mom because she called home. if he fucks with me again i won't hesitate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>its not a good comparison,, its hard to explain but a fetus has no life. its nothing unless its born. a person who wants to continue being pregnant and loves it is great, but anything could happen. theres no "every Sunday we would go shopping" "they loved this song before their stroke" its better to not be forced to continue pregnancy if its not what the person wants. pulling the plug on someone in a coma is differnt. my fetus, that was not ready for, and did not want, was aborted. they felt nothing bc they arent anything. not a sad memory or anything. when im ready ill have a child that I can support and love. my mother, (lets say, 51) fell and was put in a coma. shes very healthy and was not near the end at all and doctor said she would most likey pull through. its a law that after four weeks the pluf must be pulled if shes still in a coma. they pulled the plug because she was unconscious for 4 weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my parents are "separated", (long story they havent lived with each other in 4 yrs) you dont have to choose unless you want to, it might be split up so that youre with one parent more or less. if its a bitter situation (parents are mad and arguing) they might want to be very specific to the schedule and not let you see the other parent on their time (unless holidays, which are also arranged) it sucks and there will be tension. as time goes by your parents might become more relaxed and felxible with the schedule if there is something specific at one parents house they could let you go. just remember its not your fault, and if they fight constantly they are better off not together. they will still love you, even if you choose to only see one (or prefer one over the other) i struggle with the feelings of hurthing their feelings all the time, but its differnt for everyone. best of luck  #215;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my sibling (we'll call ha) and sister (we'll call leah) our cat Benny had 5 kittens in march. Leah said she wanted at least one (she doesn't live with us). she wanted a boy to name Dracula (cutee) All was good until a few weeks ago when Ha said they've fallen in love with drac. after making a big deal about another cats name bc we all agreed on a differnt name. since MARCH Leah has said she wanted a boy cat named drac. we got colored collars and leah picked the lovey boy cat and called it dracula since about late may. now lately our close neighbor has fallen really ill (not corona) and his mother who owns the house said shes gonna sell it to us. now Ha is saying that if they go to move out theyre taking dracula. like theyre excited for it. and that our dad (Leah lives with him) probably wont like the cat anyway so they dont care. Leah said shes not waiting for our mom to neuter the cats and shes just paying for Dracula and taking him. they already have tension and this is just gonna make it worse. fuck tldr: Ha wants Leahs cat and now they will probably fight a lot and it sucks from the outside.</TEXT>

(and if krueger is still alive when i move out hes coming too) thanks for reading !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in december last year our family got two puppies that were sisters, named Jackie and Petunia their breed is called pin tzu (miniture pinscher and shih tzu). Petunia is slightly heavier but nothing to be worried about since shes also taller. Since about March maybe Jackie has been able to jump on my bed, my moms and my sisters (all pretty high off the ground that she couldnt get to before) as well as counters and tables. Before she could get up i would have to put them up with me before bed and if they got up, i would have to wake up to put them back on, it was really complicated and made me irritable. But now that Jackie is jumping on everything with ease, i notice that Petunia doesnt. She still stands near my bed waiting to he put on. she gets on the couce and chairs easily but cant jump on anyones bed. should i be worried? ive tried to get on the ground and push her to help her be more comfortable, but its like she just cant. and ive seen her jump high before, when people come in the house she jumps up to their thighs and paws at them so she probably can do it. again, Jackie hasnt needed help getting anywhere since around March, and shes the shorter one of the two. tldr: the taller dog cant jump onto beds and needs assistance while the smaller dog has no trouble getting on beds and other higher things like counters.</TEXT>

(most, because scum bags are still littering) and that couch you put out on the curb? who has to lift that one up? its 5am in the freezing cold, theyre in tank tops and are lifting your sectional into the back of this truck, and theyre only on first street. and there is typically one driver and two that pick up the trash bags. oh, and its always a "garbage day" somewhere. i know they have days off, and switch between driving/taking garbage, but everyday garbage has to be brought to the dumps, or guess whatll happen? i forgot to take the trash out one day and by the next week i had almost 10 bags (I live in a large family) so lets show some damn appreciation for these strong men ^and women!^ who have one of the most important jobs to basic society and cleanliness of our cities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>alright, i know exactly what you are talking about. i love my moms location, surroundings, and i love my school and friends, but her and her boyfriend are toxic af and i hate it everyday. my dads house is more calm, and my sister who lives there full time is my best friend. but its in another school district and i wouldnt have my own room anymore. i know, in the end, my state of mind and happiness is better off living with my dad, but i love my moms pets, the area, and wouldnt want her to be mad with me. so for you, i know it will be so tough to decide with pressure from both parents. so start off slow. ask if you start spending more time with your dad. if your online then school (for now) shouldnt be an issue as long as there is wifi. maybe a few days extra, see how it feels, and how your dad reacts. im sure he'd be so happy with you (and siblings) to live there. and then see how your mom reacts. (is she mad? upset? sad? trying to convince you by saying bad things about your dad?) take it slow, try not to argue with your mom if she starts something with you about living there. this is about you, your comfort levels, and your happiness. i wish you the best of luck</TEXT>
