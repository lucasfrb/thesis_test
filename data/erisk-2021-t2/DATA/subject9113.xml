    <TITLE>Finally Quitting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-11 13:38:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started smoking weed at 18. I was introduced to it by my friend and her family, who all smoked. I was in a bad environment at home and in life in general, and I loved the support/inclusion I got from them. From 18 to nearly 21 (current) I smoked daily, aside from a one month break last year. At some point last year, I recognized there was ap problem but convinced myself I needed it for sleep, depression, anxiety, etc. I was also struggling with anorexia, and I found that I could pass the time and forget being hungry. I would avoid going out with my friends to stay in the comfort of my room getting stoned and watching tv. I never mentioned it to my therapist. October and november of this year I seriously struggled with binging at night when I was stoned. I told myself it's the anorexia, binging is normal etc. But it was daily, and only when I smoked. I would wake up in the morning feeling like shit, vowing to not binge. And then I would smoke and I would inhale a pack of cookies, 3 chocolate bars, popcorn, bags of chips, you name it. It created so much anxiety. I didnt know how to get out of the cycle. Over the past winter break, I didnt smoke for a week. I was happy. I didnt crave it. And I actually slept fine (although, I was with my gf and she always helps me relax and fall asleep). I wasnt binging. I figured i may as well continue this trend, right? I get back to my apartment, and the first fucking thing i do is smoke, because it's there. I spent 3 nights smoking and binging. I realized how shitty I felt, the brain fog, the anxiety and guilt I was feeling about smoking. I knew it was no longer beneficial for me like it was at 18. So, I threw it all away. The next night, i checked my grinder. No weed, but had kief. So I got stoned I was fed up, and chucked my grinder I went a night without smoking, used s melatonin to help me sleep. Last night, I really couldn't sleep and had some 1/1 edible that I ate, it didnt get me high but I feel the CBD helped me relax. I woke up without brain fog, but I still feel very guilty. I want to stop. And I'm going to. It's a little bit of a bumpy road but I dont envision myself being a stoner all my life. It served its purpose. And it's me that's the problem, not the cannabis. I have s very addictive personality, whether it be caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol. I dont drink anymore because I cant just have one. I can do the same with weed. I guess I'm posting this because i want accountability and for it to be official. I may chuck the edibles I have even though it "doesnt really do anything" yet i still took it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm glad to hear this! I would also sleep 10-11 hours and still be stuck in a brain fog all day, sometimes even taking a nap! I had insomnia before I started smoking, and became convinced I needed it in order to sleep. I guess the first little while will be rough, but I hope it gets better. (Day 1/2 ish)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As an update, I caved last night after I found some hash i hid away. Flushed it this morning. I feel like shit. I binged on a lot of food, got so stoned. Feel exhausted and drained today, have this sense of doom over me, I can barely leave my bed to go to class. The brain fog is real. The anxiety is intense. I will force myself to go to class and then let myself recover today, whether it be by sleeping or just curling up in bed. Life can wait, i need to take care of myself. I've searched high and fucking low in my apartment for anything else I have hidden. It is all gone. Finally. I only have some oil and the 1/1 gummies that do nothing and they dont appeal to me, but next time I take out the trash they are going with it. I will do this. I cant go back to living like this every day. Even though my head is saying "you just need to build up the tolerance again, it wasnt this bad before". Why build up a tolerance? Why make weed a priority in my life again? I wont smoke again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have anorexia, not bulimia, but also deal with this issue. Heating pads help so much, I'm practically glued to it. Eating smaller meals more frequently. Having higher calorie/dense food so the volume isnt as much. Drinking a lot of water. Ginger tea supposedly helps with digestion. If she doesnt have a problem with exercise, walking/stretching/yoga etc can sometimes get things moving. However, regarding the meals, if she is on a meal plan I'm not advising to go against that, this is just what personally works for me to avoid feeling so heavy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lmao was/am(?) A stoner for 3 years, was never q problem till this year when I started binging when stoned, a nightly occurence. Cue trying to escape how shitty i felt by smoking and then binging and waking up feeling even more shitty, restrict all day, smoke to escape, you know the drill. Repeat this cycle for 4 months. Then decide enough and quit smoking so you can finally lose weight again #128579; Then you realize shit I may be a tad bit dependent on this substance. Cue major depressive episode.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Becoming addicted to exercise/purging???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-09 00:16:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>General TW for ED stuff I've had an eating disorder going on 3 years now. It was very bad last year. I got better over the summer, then returning to uni everything went downhill. My weights been up and down, I was in a binge restrict cycle. Long story short, the past few weeks, I've found myself going to the gym here and there. Mostly after a binge, or when I was feeling anxious. My use of laxatives, which was never a thing, has increased ( although i dont think it's really bad, just after binges), twice in the past week ( but I dont really intend on using them frequently!) And I've purged a few times over the last couple of weeks ( again, not that bad, infrequent). However, I've gone to the gym every day this week. I've found myself stressed out planning when to go, fitting it in between my classes. We had a snow day yesterday, gym was closed and I freaked out. I went today, for my usual time (just 45 min) came home, and have been obsessing about going back to the gym tomorrow. I even had to do some home workout stuff to relieve this weird anxiety over "not doing enough". I binged yesterday (got drunk for the first time in ages), and I'm just terrified right now. Because I'm nowhere near how bad I was last year. But this absolute panic over exercise is scaring me a little bit. Today I went to get pre workout, cause I'm tired all the time. My session was really good, but then I found out that my pre workout has some mineral whatever that supposedly causes water retention and I PANICKED. I dont knos what this post was for, except that I'm afraid. But it also isnt that bad, because I'm not bad as I was? So everything is fine? But it's really, really not and it's only been two weeks and I honestly have no idea how to stop this exercise. I feel the need to increase, at least on weekends, because "I have the time for it, so i should be at the gym" I'm going home for 3 days this upcoming weekend, and I'm literally already panicking over the idea of not being able to go to the gym for 3 days. Coupled with heavy restriction, but that's a given, it's like this is my new focus. I just dont know what to do. M dietican obviously told me to cut this shit out, but I cant. And I'm only realizing it now.i thought I was choosing to go to the gym. It's only when it was closed yesterday that I realized I'm not the one controlling this. And I'm terrified of gaining weight by muscle or whatever. I'm just so afraid that I'm slowing everything down but I'm still compelled to go to the gym. It's insane. I fucking hate having an eating disorder. Rant over, I appreciate anyone who actually read this. I feel so lost and alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm terrified to visit my family. I'm going up for 3 days next weekend. They dont know I have an ED. I dont know how to avoid meals, I'm stressed to the max. I dont even know if I'll be able to eat, I'm not really on solids at the moment. Then two weeks later is march break, and I'm back there for 10 days. I'm mostly going to see my girlfriend, but I cannot manage eating and faking everything. I dont know what to do. I've hid this from them for months over the summer, and I'm usually pretty good at telling myself to suck it up for 2 or 3 days so I can go back to what I'm doing when I come back to university, but right now I'm absolutely petrified and I think I will cry if I have to eat. Im just constantly trying to plan ways I can avoid dinners. I hate this so much. Purely a vent, nothing really to say to any of this. I'm just scared</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Like I know I have a problem, I know what I'm doing is dangerous. And even though I've been diagnosed and am in therapy and seeing a dietitian my family are still unaware. My friends/roommates have caught on but stay quiet for the most part. Whenever someone talks about it it pisses me off because it's like. I know what I'm doing, get off my back. If I was gonna die or something I'd do something about it. But I'm not, so chill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am diagnosed with the same. And I have binged, but it was because I was smoking cannabis or drinking, and my dumbass never made the connection. Since quitting, I have absolutely no desire to binge, and the thought of binging or eating terrifies me to the point where I'm just fasting all the time because just thinking about how I'll have to eat a meal next weekend when I visit home scares me so much. Dietician says restriction will always result in a binge. I dont know about that honestly, I cant imagine ever binging again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a daily smoker for 3 years, from the first time I used, except for a forced month break and another forced week break. The past 4-5 months was exactly the same for me. I would get high, and just think about how much I needed to stop, how I wouldn't do it the next day, how I barely even enjoy it anymore. I'd wake up the next day and tell myself I wouldn't smoke, I'd write notes to myself reminding me not to smoke, and then I would do it again and the cycle repeats. I ended up having to throw away all of my weed. It's been about a week and a half now, and I genuinely do feel better. I'm waking up earlier, even with less sleep I feel more rested. I have more energy, and I'm more alert. You can do it! It's worth it honestly</TEXT>

I haven't been on solids for a week and a half. I'm tired. Everything hurts, my bones, my body, my chest. I'm tired of laying in bed at 7 pm with no energy, knowing I still have things to do. Im tired of going to bed hungry, just wishing I could eat. Im tired of being scared to visit family, coming up with elaborate plans for all the ways I can avoid food. I'm tired of dreaming about food, about binging, about the gym. I'm tired of just trying to make it one more day, so I can weigh myself again. I'm sad that I'm only losing weight I've already lost before, it feels pointless, like I cant even complain and theres nothing wrong. I'm tired of being tired. I'm ready for my heart to give out so I can stop feeling like this. The way things are going, itll probably be fairly soon. I'm just.so sad, and so tired. I want to give up</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On mobile I apologize ( but it's worth reading) Okay SO. I was hella craving cookies last night, like all I freaking want is peanut butter cookies, and those white chocolate chip macadamia cookies. I was literally envisioning going through the aisles of walmart, I know exactly where they are, the price, etc. I want cookies. SO. DAMN.BAD. So in research methods this morning, we sre going over different types of validity and reliability ( convergent, criterion, etc boring psych stuff I know). To get us to have a greater understanding, our prof gave us a hypothetical example where we had to determine 6 things that would make a "perfect" cookie. I'm drooling, but we list stuff like size, freshness, ingredients, etc. THEN GET THIS she goes and whips out 4 DIFFERENT KINDS OF COOKIES FOR US TO EAT, THEN RATE THEM ACCORDING TO OUR LIST. I was like fuck my life I have to turn down FREE DELICIOUS COOKIES and all I want are COOKIES. But seriously though, what are the fucking chances that I'm losing my mind over goddamn cookies and a university prof brings in 4 different kinds of cookies for a goddamn RESEARCH METHODS class. YALL I'm still hella salty. Fuck her for being nice lmao. I just want cookies.</TEXT>

In a way it's nice to know it's all in my head and people aren't staring at me knowing I look like I gained 20 pounds overnight.

    <TEXT>Yeah, I was in a binge restrict cycle and it was like. I was terrified of gaining weight but also I felt so hopeless and like I'd never lose again so I kept binging.... Then once i hit a certain point (prob when my brain stops working logically tbh) my whole thought process changes and its like. Okay, this is where you're at, it's scary but eating more literally wont fix it, and somehow it becomes more of a long term mindset? Like when I'm binging it's like oH nO I havent lost 10 pounds OvErNiGhT guess I'm a FAILURE so may as well eat but when im restricting it's like, okay, you had x amount, it's still less than you need, so even tho the scale hasn't moved you're still in a deficit, you're good, itll come off eventually. Abd then it gets to a point where I'm legit afraid to have my gummy vitamins because god forbid I have anything extra. And then I'm going to the gym, and fasting, terrified to have two things a day instead of one, terrified of fruit, sugar, protein, literally anything so. Yeah I dont understand how my mindset can shift so fast but it does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate it. Yeah was never a problem last year, but for some reason I just cant smoke and restrict this year. I havent been this high a weight in years, and it's absolutely terrifying. Skipped classes cause I feel gross, just really struggling. But I will throw out 100 bucks worth of weed and start again, I finally got it through my thick brain that it just isnt gonna work, and I cant be allowed to have a couple hours of peace a night. Just 24/7 misery. Fun fact though, the last time I had edibles I was starving (hah) and without thinking, I shoved 2 and a half homemade brownies down my throat before realizing, oh FUCK those have q lot of weed in them. Was high for 48 hours ( I dont mess around with edibles lol) and must have eaten 10-12,000 calories in that span. It was wake up, eat till I was sick, pass back out, wake up, eat more, etc. Fun times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm seriously considering breaking ties with my dietician and maybe my therapist I've gained 20 pounds in a week. But its not just that. I'm wasting her time because I go in, and I know what I need to do and what she recommends, yet I dont do it. I'm just complaining to her about how miserable I am. I get anxious about the appointments because I feel like I have to stay below a certain weight For therapy, I just want to stop. I'm tired of trying, I just want to stop, like maybe I'll get over the ED or maybe not but I won't feel pressured to be a certain way and really I just want to stop thinking about what I'm doing is wrong or unhealthy, I just want to go back to the honeymoon phase where I didnt recognize/got too malnourished to understand that it wasnt right. I cant tell if I'm just overwhelmed and want to focus on living my life or if I just want to spiral for a few months then reappear being like "pls help, I'm ready now".like I'm wasting everyone's time, it's like I've completely shut them all out in my head, it's just aggression and a general "fuck off" vibe. I used to appreciate them so much but I just feel like the shittiest person who deserves whatever pain comes my way. But I mean I'm not doing too bad clearly considering I GAINED 20 pounds in a WEEK (thx cannabis). Is my body image terrible? Yes. Am I restricting? Yes.do I have negative thoughts about myself and an intense fear of eating? Yes But I KNOW the steps I have to take to "get out of it" and I either cant or wont so theres no point in wasting everyone's time. I think I just have to learn the hard way, when I end up collapsing at some point. Maybe then I'd be like. Yeah, you should probably get help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tw for trauma I was sexually assaulted as a child, never mentioned it to anyone until I was 18. I start with this because it's the root cause (we think). Growing up I had s lot of mental health issues, but food and body size was never an issue. At 18, I was in a toxic home environment, and I didnt notice but I began to eat less. I was just being healthy, or so i thought. A coworker was encouraging me, even introducing me to laxatives. It quickly spiraled, I'm not sure how it "clicked" but suddenly it was about counting calories, jogging in my room. I felt guilty for eating, like I was doing something wrong. I move away to university, where everything went downhill. I was so stressed, so depressed, and my trauma was coming back to haunt me. I couldn't deal with anything. For me, being small(er) makes me feel safer. I feel guilty for eating. I have extreme anxiety over food and feeling full. It's about the number, in a way, because if its bot lower every day it crushes me. But I never went down this path intending to lose weight to fix my body image. Although I look in the mirror and can point out that I "can still stand to lose" weight in certain areas (etc face, thigh, whatdver) I know I look gross to others. But when I eat, everythingcomes back and I get so worked up I cannot function in my life. Anorexia has "helped" me survive by reducing my life to nothing, each day the same routine, I'm so exhausted that every day is a struggle to just get through the day. I hope this helps in some way. I know a lot of people with Ed's have histories of trauma (esp people with bulimia). Its tough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I cant imagine living with an eating disorder for that long. Its frightening that that may happen to me. My eating disorder started "relatively" late, at 18. At the time, I was in a pretty toxic home environment. A lot of past trauma stuff began to come up, things I've never discussed or told anyone despite being in the mental health system/therapy/hospital since I was 11. I didnt notice at first, but I began to eat less. I suffer from depression so maybe it was that i was losing my appetite. As more and more trauma stuff came up, and as my environment got worse, it became something to focus on. It didnt really get too bad until I moved away for university and was in complete control of what I was eating. The past two years of university have been a blur of being malnourished, binging, self harming and suicidal ideation all because of this eating disorder. I barely remember last year because I was so ill. Terrified to eat anything, body dysmorphia was crazy, even though I took advantage of the counselling and dietician services, nothing has helped with the ED. We think it's a coping mechanism to deal with trauma/life. It serves a purpose, "protects" me. All it's done is made me lose time, friends, and experiences. I no longer know how to eat normally, it's either restriction or binging. I've almost died from this disorder, yet I cant let go of it. It controls my life. I "relapsed" in smoking weed a couple weeks ago, and have since been indulging and binging. Gained 30 pounds, putting me smack dab in the middle of a healthy weight. I know my brain is working better now, but I cant stand to be in my skin at the moment, so I will be quitting and turning back to my ED. EDs suck and I truly wish I've never developed this disorder. I was messed up enough to begin with. If I could erase any of my mental illnesses, it would be the ED. This is ruined my life beyond anything else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tw for general rant/ED shit/number ish So I've gained 30 pounds in a couple weeks due to extreme hunger/ binging ( theres a difference I know, I had extreme hunger AND was binging separately) thanks in part to good ol mary jane. Anyways. Im done, not smoking anymore, and I cant stay at this weight. I feel like crawling out of my skin. I was really stressed for the summer and hiding weight loss and making sure it seemed like I was eating and stuff but I'm not that concerned anymore. I'm not going back to therapy or dietician next year, I'm ready to hit my goal weight at some point. I'm not going to waste any more time. I cant live like this. I want to reverse the past two weeks. I didn't shower for 5 days because I cant look at myself. Weed is nice cause i dont feel guilty for eating but fast forward two weeks and I realize the damage has been done and I fucked myself over. I'm 21, my mother cannot make me eat, they are used to seeing me pretty tiny, I'll be working and I can lie, itll be fine. Fuck everyone, I'm done. Bout to break up with my partner cause I'm a shit human being and want to focus on my ED and be alone. Want to drop out of uni cause I just dont give a shit anymore. I'm a better person when I am literally dying. I'm a lazy asshole as it stands right now. I need to get my shit together</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've realized I may have some sort of a dependency issue with weed, as all year I've been fighting the "binging" that comes at night when I smoke. Yet, despite wanting to stop this "binging" and finding it difficult to do when I smoke, I continue to smoke. I've realized it's literally the only time i can eat and not feel guilty, have food actually taste good, and enjoy eating. I say "binging" in quotations because it's not an emotional thing, it's just that I can eat 4000 calories no problem. But, I'm stopping, I'm bringing it all back to my parents house. I will be miserable and depressed, I will let myself spiral. I will focus on staying sober this summer. When I am sober, not eating at night is fine. Binging doesnt happen because I'm too terrified to eat. The last time I stopped smoking I wasnt able to eat solids. It gets bad. The past two weeks I've bee smoking I've put on a lot of weight and am weight restored. It's difficult because I know if I just stopped smoking this wouldn't have happened ( which is how I kinda know I have dependency issues, cause I'd give up anything to lose weight, yet I cant give this up). Oh well. Here's to making better choices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a necessity. Gotta do what I gotta do. Shit sucks, I dont want to, doesnt matter, I have to. I eat every day but something smaller than a full meal, so I can sort of justify it. I just pay more attention to what I'm eating, focus on nutrients I guess. At the end of the day, I tell myself the x amount I'm eating is still far below what I need. The heaviness I feel, the guilt, the way I can see my body getting bigger whenever I eat, it's all in my head. Because im still below what I need. Whenever I panic, I just tell myself that. And that may not be the best mindset, but it calms me down and reassures me when I feel overwhelmed and guilty. Knowing that i physically cannot gain eating what I am eating each day reassures me when I feel big and heavy and guilty. And even when that doesnt work, I know I need my meds, and it doesnt matter how i feel or what i want, i have to take them with food.it is what it is. I give myself the tough talk. Too bad, you still gotta. It doesnt matter what I want. Gotta do it. And then I cry after.</TEXT>

Now I have to deal with my grandmother commenting on everything I eat, essentially force feeding me, rubbing my cheeks and feeling my spine when she hugs me. I have to deal with my mother saying she was up all night worrying about me, asking if I've been to the doctor. When I try to cover up wearing baggy clothes, she'll say she cant tell how I'm doing cause I wore my loosest pants. I deal with my girlfriends mom making comments on my body, how I never eat, how tiny i am. I deal with my gf looking at my body with fear, afraid to touch me in case i break. Have to deal with comments whenever I do eat, how I need to fatten up, how I'll get sick and die if I have nothing to me. At first it felt like success, now it's a stressful, exhausting secret I try to manage daily. And when I go back to uni and return home 20 pounds lighter and I have to see the shock and fear and concern and comments everyone makes, it makes me feel sick and sad and afraid and angry.

    <TEXT>I've finally, after many years, began to accept myself. I've wanted a binder for 4 years now and dreamed of shopping in the mens section since I was 10. Today it's my 21st birthday, and I finally did it. I couldn't have known how much better I would feel having my chest flat ( I'm fairly small anyways but still) wearing clothes that finally felt comfortable. I've been living in baggy hoodies and sweatpants for years. Growing out my body hair, finally starting to open up to a few friends that I'm not cis, telling them the name I've thought of myself as for years now. I was/am so so afraid. Theres so many bad things that will happen if I come out. It's almost like I dont want it to be true because my life will be flipped upside down. My family will probably never want to speak to me again. But I have a wonderful partner who is accepting and loving no matter what. And knowing that she doesnt hate me or judge me and doesnt love me any less I think has let me try to accept myself too. It doesnt fix half of the dysphoria I feel. But i finally feel some relief. I finall feel like I dont want to jump out of my body as much. I can stand to look at myself. I hold myself different. I am more talkative and friendly. I'm happier. I feel terrified. But I also feel more at peace with myself, and i really dont want to give that up. I dont think I could anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just commenting on the last bit to second it, because I am currently where you were. I've suffered from mental health problems since I was 9. Always felt uncomfortable in my body and looking back, there are so many signs I wasnt cis. Developed an eating disorder, felt "more comfortsble" in my body. I've been suicidal and depressed for years, it's been horrendous, nobody knows what to do with me. Recently, I've gained weight and dysphoria has hit hard. I also decided to say "screw it, I already want to die" and get some mens clothes, boxers, and a binder. What do you know, I feel so much more secure in my body. It doesnt fix the eating disorder, but I've realized a big part of it comes from trying to change my body not necessarily for the "typical" ED reasons, but to combat dysphoria. Always been afraid of coming out bc I experienced trauma and have an ED, and a lot of people who detranisition also have those, and I didnt want to rush anything or intrude on a space that wasnt mine. But I'm 20 pounds heavier than I was a month ago, and I can confidently say I feel at least okay at this weight bc I present in a way that makes me more comfortable. Sorry for the long reply, but I really relate to the "I have nothing left to lose" and sort of hitting rock bottom. I honestly didnt expect to be alive to see this summer, and now I can see it and want to be around, even though I am absolutely, completely terrified of others comments, being disowned/kicked out when I go home in 6 weeks. But i would rather want to be alive as a Male and struggle to make it than go back to the utter hell I was living in for the past 10 years</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Going home due to COVID, not out. Panicking</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-17 12:51:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as there were two presumptive cases on my campus, my mom wants me home for at least two weeks. I've recently began socially transitioning, have new clothes etc. She is totally unaware. I'm so afraid that I'll somewhat be "forced" to come out, when I'm not ready. And if it goes south, im stuck at the house???? My binder is still shipping, so I'll have to come back and get my "special hoodie", but if she decides she wants to come with me for a trip since theres nothing to do and wants to see how do I explain? I legit thought about wearing my old clothes just to protect myself but I honestly cannot, the thought makes my skin crawl. I need to keep using my shampoo and deodorant, and when they hug me they'll ask questions. They'll wonder why I'm tucking my hair in my beanie, if they catch me doing laundry they'll wonder why I have boxers. I've identified as esbian for 10 years now so maybe I can play the "butch lesbian" card with the clothes, even though I literally hate the idea. I'm scared. This wasnt how coming out should have been and I'm so scared that itll go wrong. I was planning on very slowly coming out this summer anyways, but I need to do it on my terms, not be thrown a direct question I'm forced to answer. And I csnt pretend to be cis, my mental health will crumble more than dysphoria already makes it. Does anyone have advice? The biggest issue is me smelling different and my binder I have to come back for. And I hate that they will be calling me by my birth name and using she/her, it crushes me. I dont know how to cope with it really. People at uni have been using Theo and he him for a while now and suddenly having to go back makes me want to cry honestly. I'm not ready.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry, the entire situation is stressful. And I am "basically" out completely, everyone uses proper pronouns and my name, friends know I'm planning on starting T, etc. I've just never fully said "hey everyone im trans" they just filled in the blanks/accepted what I'm doing without questioning. And that's true, I guess I was thinking of my grandmother who loves to give me big hugs and take a big whiff of my hair and say "you smell so good!" Lol I know, cute old people. I did dress more masc/use my brothers shampoo when I was up last, and I even asked my grandmother her opinion on trans people since she is very accepting of the LGB(T?) Community, she was fine, and my mom says she doesnt care who I date she just wants me to be happy, so I'm compiling this "ammo" in case they're suddenly not okay with me being trans. And I've made a backup plan, if it happens and goes poorly bmy girlfriend is willing to take me back to campus (I dont own a car). So i have my escape route planned if it happens and goes to shit, so I'm feeling a little better. Just dont like the idea of being pressured into coming out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont spend a ton of time on reddit, but I do see a fair amount of well intentioned cis people just genuinely being curious and wanting to know more, but afraid to ask in case they come off as a transphobe. In my opinion, these are te people we should be educating, because it comes from a good place. It's not their fault they are ignorant (in the sense they truly judt dont know/understand). While I understand the trans community isnt responsible for educating cis people, it is rather alarming that cis people feel afraid/uncomfortable trying to learn. Feels like we tend to block them out because they are not of the "in group". This is only for the well intentioned, curious cis people. I'm not talking about those who are asking invasive questions that they wouldn't ask anyone else (what's in your pants, how do you have sex, etc). I mean the people who ask stuff like "what's it like being trans, how did you know, how can I help". I've had cis friends irl who say they are afraid to ask their trans roommate anything because he will snap at them and insult them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ED getting bad again</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-02 13:59:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tw for some weight mention and dsyphoria A couple months ago, my eating really improved. I finally started to accept that I'm FTM, and I realized a lot of my body "dsymoprhia" and need to be thin was actually gender dsyphoria. I bought new clothes and used products that felt better. Being seen as a man helped my eating SO much, to the point I was perfectly comfortable gaining 25 pounds. I havent been at this (healthy!!) Weight since before my ED, three years ago. My therapist and dietician both were through my university, and since it got closed, I dont have access to them. But I knew I had to keep myself healthy. I felt better than I had in years. I was myself, I could think clearly, and overall I was happy, even though I was dealing with my gender. The dsyphoria feels different than the ED need to be small. But as my dsyphoria intensified, I felt I needed to lose "just a few pounds" so my figure would be less feminine. I just want to pass. I hate my hips and thighs. Just a few pounds right. Yeah. Fed myself all these lies. Enter a few ED behaviors. Only eating in a certain window. Counting calories. Weighing every day to make sure "I'm on track". It's not the worst I've ever been. But I notice it taking a toll, affecting my mood, and once again I've had the "oh no. I thought i was in control but shit I'm not". I truly do not want to go back to that utter hell Ed's bring you. I know it all too well. But I dont want to look feminine. And it's not even about what my goal is anymore. I'm afraid to eat. It got me again. I just want to be seen as a man. I just want food to not be a concern in my life. I just want to see my team and figure out how I can navigate this. I hate all of this so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was in that stage for years- wanting to wear mens clothes, wanting to cut my hair, wanting to go by a different name - for years I've been depressed and anxious, always carrying this deep sense of discomfort with me all the time. On my 21st birthday (exactly a month ago actually!) I said fuck it, if I dont do this I will continue to be miserable, the worst case is I'm completely wrong and I wasted 200 bucks on clothes and products i wont use. So i bought some new clothes, boxers, shampoo/deodorant, hats, etc. Everything I've wanted to for years. (I know clothes dont equal gender, this was just the catalyst of actually accepting I'm trans/starting the process). When I first put the clothes on, I felt immediately less uncomfortable. I actually liked how I looked. Smelling more masculine, my gf accepting me as her boyfriend and referring to me as such, this helped so much. But wait. Maybe I just liked dressing masculine. Maybe I'm just a butch lesbian. Forget about the fact that I've wanted my chest gone since before I knew what top surgery was, cutting my hair all off at 13, wearing boys clothes as a kid, obsessing over trans videos/stories and heavily relating since 15, and since puberty always carrying this awful pit in my stomach. I didnt have dsyphoria, right? That's not what that is. What if I'm just trying to "fix" my issues by changing who I am? So I bought a binder. I've wanted one since I was 15 or so (I've always had a fairly small chest and gave myself a lot of shit for hating it when others have larger chests), and let me tell you. I cried. That feeling of always subconsciously hiding my chest through baggy shirts and hoodies, being hunched over, that was gone. Its the first time I could stand up straight and feel comfortable. I grew out my body hair. Bc of lockdown I cant get my hair cut, but I hide it under a beanie. While I feel more free than I ever have, I also struggle more. It's like I opened up this box of everything I've avoided/suppressed for so long. I feel more like me than ever, while also feeling so far away from feeling whole. When the few people I've told refer to me by my name, when my girlfriend calls me her boyfriend, when my older brother called me little bro, i am so happy. When I'm referred to as she/her, when my grandmother says I am so pretty, the weight and pit in my stomach comes back. Sorry for the ramble, but id say the wardrobe change and binder was the "aha" moment. Then everything I was too afraid to feel or deal with came up, stuff I didnt even realize i struggled with, or things in the past I didnt recognize at the time as dsyphoria but was. I'd say, if you're in a place where you can safely do so, try wearing different clothes. Watch trans videos, see if you relate. Try using mens deodorant and shampoo, growing out body hair, and binding. I finally let myself try this because it's nothing permanent, nobody in my family had to know I was living as a man at university, and by letting myself know that just because I'm doing this didnt mean I was committing to being trans. I was really afraid of accidentally intruding on a space or community that wasnt mine. And it just so happened that I was denying myself of feeling whole my entire life, and although I'm terrified and want to take this slow, I accept I'm trans. So try things out and see how you feel. Your process may not look the same but you deserve to feel like yourself however that ends up looking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just commented on a post you made recently, but I saw this too and thought I'd comment. You describe a lot of what I was feeling just a month ago. I was sick and tired of feeling the way I did. I thought I'd kill myself before I finished my degree. I've suffered with an eating disorder for 3 ish years and it was completely controlling my life. I was so detached from my body and who I was. I remember thinking that my body wasnt "me" and I was sick and tired of having to take care of (feed, bathe, etc) a body that wasnt mine. I couldn't recognize myself in a mirror. And then in a short span of time I gained a good 20 pounds. And I turned 21, said fuck it I'm ready to not wake up tomorrow and of living my life this way, I'm buying mens clothes etc. And if you have never struggled with disordered eating or know someone, you may not recognize the significance of how much better I felt in these clothes. I was completely fine with my weight and body size. I then was able to see that it's not my WEIGHT I hate, it's that my body isnt right. I separated the eating disorder from the gender dysphoria. And I've taken steps since then to live as male and things aren't necessarily great, but I feel more like myself than ever. I find comfort in knowing I can do things to alleviate this sickening discomfort and unease I always feel. I can stand up straight when I bind. I actually want to live my life, even if it's only to transition and finally live my life feeling whole. There is no harm in trying things out friend. If it feels right, continue and dint feel rushed to go on to the "next thing". Go st whatever pace feels right and okay, and go back a couple steps if you need/want to. You deserve to feel okay in your skin and happy in your life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have had serious concerns about whether or not I'm fooling myself. If I'm consuming too much trans media, my friend is trans am I just copying them, am I just trying to be different, escape, become a new person? I am extremely cautious with saying I'm trans. At the beginning, the closest i could get was "I'm not cis" or being agender because I honestly couldn't accept that I was trans. I was/am afraid. I dknt want to be trans. I dont want the struggle that comes with it. I just want to not have to do this. What I can say. Is so far, I've come out to 5 people. I was a wreck each time. I had convinced myself they would say I'm lying or I'm confused or just downright hate me. My family life is complicated, so I told friends and my girlfriend. They all accepted it, while voicing their concerns for my wellbeing. My girlfriend tries her best to help. Today, I came out to my aunt, because i knew even if she hated it she wouldn't spread my shit around. She was great. Then I found out my brother overheard. My little brother was like i know what's up, and it's okay, and I gotchu and i love you". What I'm trying to say is, if its other's reactions that you're afraid of (and I'll admit it's a founded fear), consider if it sont be as bad as you think it will be. Obviously I dont know your situation but any friends, extended family, hell even what you're doing here is great. I broke down the barrier in part because I was fed up, but I honestly also gave myself a lot of compassion. What was the worst thing that would happen if i dressed this way? Reassuring myself that i have people who love me for me and i dont need people who cant accept that. Because the more things i do that feel right to me (and what's right for me may not be right for you), the less I am willing to give this feeling up. Telling myself it's okay to do whatever it is that makes me feel the best. Letting myself have an out, like I said by not committing to anything. Letting myself have as much time as I needed to figure it out. Telling myself that even if I ended up cutting my hair and presenting as a man, that didnt mean I would have to go on t or get top surgery etc. (At this point I desperately do want these things, but by relieving the sort of pressure? I put on myself to commit to medically transitioning, the more sure it's something I actually want and not feel like I have to). Also, I was tired of feeling like I was living a certain way for others. I was afraid of what my abusive family would do or say. I'm afraid to disappoint my mom. But I've been stuck in an awful cycle for years and I've never done what I want. What genuinely makes me happy. And yes, the bot thing was hilarious haha. My inbox is open if you ever want to dm me. Be well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried to quit before, didnt succeed. The issue I'm having is, the only reason I really want to quit is so I stop getting the munchies. Which sounds reasonable, but I've suffered with an eating disorder for 3 years. I'm currently st a healthy weight due to m nightly snacking/binging earlier on. And I just want to go back. I wouldn't say weed has many other negative effects for me. I only smoke in the evening, and not that much. I dont crave it really and if I'm out it's not a big deal. The biggest issue is the mental turmoil getting the munchies has on me. So quitting will help with that, but I'm also terrified to slide back into the depths of my eating disorder. I dont really know what to do. I tell myself to stop for a week or so, to "get my eating under control" but I know what that means. Abd it's like I'm afraid to stop smoking because I dont want to go back to that mental hell. I know I could just eat and not smoke, but my entire day is filled with ED thoughts, restriction, and exercise. It's only when I smoke that the restraints let up, and I can eat. Idk what to do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, ftm here (pre-t). The only thing I can really say is I have similar fears. Like maybe I'd lose a core trait or something. But what I've also noticed is the more I try to pass as male, have people call me Theo, bind, etc, the more confident I am. The more "me" I feel, and it actually makes my personality "better" or more authentic. I feel comfortable to talk, behave, and interact with others in a way that feels right. Before, I was shy, never initiated conversations, basically just wanted to hide. I mean I wasnt antisocial, I could hold a convo. But it felt. Bland? Idk. And I am so much more outgoing and happy, and others notice an "improvement" in me. So I'm thinking, if you transition to who you truly are (however that looks) you might leave some traits behind, but you'll probably feel more comfortable and like yourself, and that'll shine through.</TEXT>

I remember how sad I was, how I'd "window shop" for groceries online. It's awful. But then stress builds up. Work, school, family, whatever. And this need to escape comes up and I just give in bc I'm too tired and I dont care anymore. And then I fall back into the same place. And I just wish it could stop.</TEXT>

If you've been restricting for a while, it's super common to just constantly want to eat chips and cookies and fast food etc. Its either bc you're physically lacking in fuel or mentally lacking in satisfaction or both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You aren't just being a slacker. I'm going into my third year next September, and have suffered with anorexia for 3 ish years. I'm also studying psychology actually, and have a high GPA somehow. But no, I have no energy to do my work, I have no clue how I manage to pass, let alone get good grades. My brain always feels scrambled and fried, and the amount of energy it takes to read an article is ridiculous. I went to uni with the intent to honor in psych, maybe do a double major. Be involved, volunteer, join some clubs, work. Slowly but surely each of these goals faded away when I realized I can barely manage class, head home, and homework. That is all I can do, and I hate it because I know if I was healthy I could do so much more. I feel like I've wasted my university experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have this fear I'm moving too quickly. It's not a new thing. 15-16 really thought I was trans, pushed it away. Around 21 I said fuck it let's try some things out. Everything feels right. Its been about 3 months since accepting myself (even though I think I knew deep down I was trans), I've told my gf and s few friends, but not family. I'm cutting my hair soon, and I'm afraid my family will catch on or whatever. I know itll cause a lot of problems (just the haircut, let alone coming out). I bind, wear mens clothes/products, and go by Theo when I can. This feels right. My reasoning for cutting my hair is that it's just hair, not permanent. I want to. But I still have this fear I'm moving "too fast", and if I'm not ready to come out to family. Even though in reality it's been 5-6 years, it's only been 3 months that I've actively been exploring it and trying to fix the dsyphoria. Am I moving too fast? When did you come out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My gf(cis) has the same concerns about me. Basically I just told her if I cant do something than that's that, but that I do try to do things she likes. Sometimes it means stopping and putting my binder on, or boxers. Sometimes it means I cant use my strap on cause it makes me hella dysphoric. Sometimes it means I have to stop completely. Essentially we just use ongoing consent (which should always be used but yeah) and i feel fully free to stop whatever I'm doing. Shes done her research on dsyphoria and gets it. Idk if your bf is very sexual, I know for me dsyphoria literally ruins any form of sexual pleasure. I dont enjoy sex right now, but I do it for my partner. I get nothing out of it, and it's more anxiety inducing than anything. Its complicated bc I'm attracted to her and want to be with her but dsyphoria ruins any chances of me enjoying myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude that's exactly how it was/is for me. I had a lot of other mental health issues. I came out as "not cis" (lol I couldn't even say it) in February. Came home early due to the pandemic. I'm stressed 24/7, I feel like I'm acting as the person they expect me to be and not myself. It's this constant weight over my head, knowing I'll probably have to come out sooner rather than later and just not wanting to do it. I wish I could skip forward in time and avoid the coming out process and just be on the other side. Its brutal. With the hair cut, I guess well see. The only way I can get myself to do it is by saying its bot permanent, you can grow it out, etc. I know I need to stop living my life under others expectations. But family is complicated. Everything is hard. I just want to be me and happy. I just dont know if family and happiness are compatible</TEXT>

I dont think they'll understand or be willing to accept it, that's what I'm preparing myself for. They'll have a million questions I may not be able to answer. I think my biggest barrier is if they just dont understand and I have to be open and vulnerable with them. We have a shitty history and only recently mended it. I dont know if I can be that vulnerable with them and risk everything again. Absolute worst case, I'll move back to my apartment for the summer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting question. Well, the gender of the partner would be based on our own sexuality. I'm a trans guy and I'm straight (so, women).I knew I liked women long before I knew I was trans. I may let other folks who are more knowledgable/ experienced refer to the sexuality of our partners., but from my experience my only serious relationship, my girlfriend is bisexual. Although, she was a newly outed bisexual who started dating me as a woman and turns out I'm trans. So for finding partners, I wouldn't know. For me, if I wasnt with my current partner I wouldn't really want to be with anyone else. Not really interested. Just out of curiosity, why are you asking? Just cause you're curious? (that's totally fine I'm just wondering what sparked that question lol)</TEXT>

Well I woke up still stoned and had to find my way to the store to replace her snacks, came home with 50 bucks worth of snacks for me and proceeded to eat and then pass out for the remainder of the weekend. I must have consumed 10-15k calories. I was so fucked up. I dont know what happened. I remember thinking I was literally going to die from all the food lol.</TEXT>

Have everything you need on hand. Make it a routine. Say " at 5 pm I'm going to start supper every day". It becomes a routine. Have alternative meals that you can just throw in the oven or microwave. Make extras, so you can have it for lunch or supper the next day. Or make a big batch of say rice or something and use that as a side or in stir frys or whatever for the next few days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, for me growing up, I think I was okay being a girl (ftm). I didnt grow up thinking i wanted to be a boy. But i wanted to shop in the boys section, i wanted short hair, i was jealous that the boys played certain sports and I couldn't. But I didnt make the connection that I wanted to be a boy. I'd say buy a feminine outfit. Shave your legs and stuff. Try things that aren't permanent and see how you feel. I didnt make the connection until I binded and wore mens clothes and grew out my body hair and stuff that I was like. Holy fuck. THIS is how you're supposed to feel? And I gave myself permission to not commit to anything. Just bc I wore mens clothes doesnt mean I'm trans. But I know I'll never go back to women's clothes and ill never leave the house without s binder and everything I'm doing feels more right than ever. Give yourself time. You dont have to know overnight. I always heard dsyphoria was so bad that you wanted to die and stuff. It's not like that for me. It's a deep sense of discomfort, its uncomfortable. It feels harsh when people use my birth name. Like little papercuts all day long that remind me I'm not who I really am (showering, names, clothes). And i feel really disconnected from my body. Like, it's not really mine? And I'm annoyed i have to care for this body that I dont like. I heavily questioned it too. And maybe you aren't trans and that's okay. But when I started doing things to present as a man, nothing has ever felt more right. The discomfort lifts. And that's kinda how I figured it out. I still worry that I'm not really trans or like. I'm trying to reinvent myself or something. But I know I'm not, because doing these things makes me genuinely happy, and safe, and just... right. Good luck!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tw for time of the month and dsyphoria, but heres a trick So I dont know why I didnt think of this. I refuse to use tampons cause my dsyphoria skyrockets, but pads never fit well in boxers, and I dont want to ruin them, so I end up wearing boy shorts or something and that also makes me dysphoric. So maybe I'm an idiot. But my gf was life why not wear your boxers over top of the underwear and I dont know why I'm so dumb but I did and it helps dsyphoria a lot. So to anyone else who struggles with it and cant think outside the box like me, try that it works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didnt recognize dsyphoria for what it was until I was 21 and started to transition. But I've always had it in some form or another. I have always felt discomfort within myself, like i could never find peace being in my body. I felt... wrong. Different. I have always said that my body didnt feel like home. I have always felt the need to run away and escape. I experienced sexual trauma as a child and dealt with mental health issues since then, so I always figured it was related to that. But it's not. Its different. I used to try and escape through self destructive means. I hated my body. I wanted to punish it. I was angry. I feel very disconnected from my body, like it's not mine. I've said many times that I am irritated that I have to take care of this body- feed it, bathe it, etc because it's not mine. I never... recognized myself in the mirror. I knew it was me, but. It wasnt right. Since beginning my transition, I recognize this deeply rooted sense of discomfort and heaviness I carry is dsyphoria. Because, doing things that make me feel more masculine and help me pass relieves it. It is the only thing that takes it away. I never knew it was possible to feel... okay, at peace? In your body. It's not necessarily "gender euphoria", it just lessons the intense discomfort. It makes me feel okay. It makes me feel like my body is mine. I would never go out. I hated taking pictures of myself. I didnt want to be remembered. I didnt want people to see me. I thought it was depression and once I died I didnt want anyone to have memories of me. Since starting my transition, i like taking pictures. When people see me as a man, i want to be involved. I want to do things. I want people to know me. It pains me that I never understood what this was. But I recognize I am lucky to have figured it out relatively early in life. It's not easy, and in many was dsyphoria has increased sense realizing I'm trans. But in a way, it offers hope, because I can finally see the end to this pain. I know what I have to do to be okay. And that's the thing, I HAVE to. It's not that you know, it would be nice or itz interesting. If I want to live a full life and be happy and not hate myself, I NEED to transition. It is the solution to this ugliness I have carried all my life. And its painful but also comforting. And I cant wait to feel at home in my body. Sorry for long post, I got carried away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It probably stems from those with disordered eating/eating disorders. I know I cant so any diet without becoming obsessed and spiraling into restriction again. By giving myself permission to eat whatever I want (and no, I dont mean 5k calories of cake, I literally mean eating when I'm hungry/ not cutting out food groups) I can learn to tune into when I'm hungry, avoid an all or nothing mindset, etc. Hence the restore trust with your body, cause it knows what it wants. It's all about becoming in tune with yourself and not abiding strictly by a diet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I describe dsyphoria as feeling a deep sense of discomfort that transitioning relieves. I've always held this deep sense of wrongness or otherness. It feels like I am trapped in my body and want to escape. Does being perceived as a boy bother you? What is it about yourself that makes you question if you are trans? And it is perfectly fine if you're not trans, if your gender non-conforming or nonbinary. My advice would be do what makes you feel better about yourself. Maybe that's dressing more feminine. Maybe it's being referred to as a woman. Paint your nails, shave. See how you feel. Just because you are experimenting doesnt mean you need to commit to anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey man, it is completely fair to be feeling all of this. It's really hard. I'm in a similar boat to you. When I was 15 or 16 I pretty much knew I was trans but shoved it away for years. I moved out and went to university. Struggled with being self destructive and an eating disorder for 3 years. I was always trying to "fix" the problem. On my 21st birthday I said fuck it and bought a binder and mens clothes. I have never felt more like myself. I'm not out yet, but I really enjoyed the freedom of being able to do what I want without family or whoever nagging me telling me I'm wrong. I'm sorry about your gf. Does she understand trans issues? I was terrified to tell mine. She started looking it up bc I was unable to really describe or talk about it. And she gets it now. And she is my strongest support. But what matters most is you are comfortable with yourself. Dont hide that for anyone. And you'll get there one day too. You can do whatever you want in your life, you might just have to wait a little while. And I know its painful, and exhausting, and not right. But it will be worth it. There is an end. You'll get there eventually.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey so I use the gc2b binder. I vape a lot too. In the past few days I've developed a phlegmy cough and have been coughing up phlegm. With all this covid stuff going on, I just want to make sure it's because of vaping and binding, I think if I stopped binding for a few days it would go away? Caught in between wanting to bind and trying to take care of myself. Has anyone else experienced this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From like 11-16 was really rough. I ended up in the hospital twice, once for 15 months. I've had 2 serious attempts throughout that time. And I continued living. I'm 21 now. Depression and anxiety hasn't gone away. I've had 7 ish years of therapy, tried dozens of meds. Sprinkle in some PTSD, an eating disorder, and gender dsyphoria. I am struggling. I recognize I'm also in a much better, more stable place (no longer wildly acting on impulse and emotion 24/7). But I am suffering you much. Even if I can distract, "use my skills", convince myself not to act out on the intrusive images and thoughts. Even if I have the most wonderful girlfriend. I am still heavy. I am still scared. I still cant figure out how to eat. And I have no clue on how to come out and deal with the aftermath. I know I dont have to, but I cant keep hearing how they talk about me and feeling like I'm holding this huge weight and secret. All of this to say. I've come a long way. And I still feel suicidal. I still want to be self destructive. I cant control the eating disorder. But because I'm in a healtheir/more rational mindset, I dont know. I'm too afraid to commit suicide. I feel guilty for wanting to dissapear. I just wish I was never born, or that my previous attempts would have worked. Because both should have. And I am so thankful for what I have in life. I'm so happy with my girlfriend. I recognize the good. But I still just wish. I could lose control and just do it, or that it had worked. And its fucking me up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me too dude. I'm 21 and in university, away from family (except I'm home for the summer). On my birthday I bought new clothes and a binder, I've never felt better. I was chicken to cut my hair, then lockdown started and now I cant. I feel super feminine and like nobody will take me seriously because of my hair, and it makes me incredibly dysphoric. Add to that my round face and my body is just feminine. So yeah, I get it. I've been wanting to come out but it's like. I fee like people will think I'm a joke (my family, my gf knows I'm a man and so do my friends). I'm in the same boat, it sucks. But you just have to wait till you're out of the house and you can do whatever it is that makes you feel the most like yourself. It wont be like this forever, so just hang im there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, but that's not what the post is saying. Diets are harmful to children (I'd argue anyone but whatever). They are detrimental to self image, encourages a hyper focus on calories and appearance, and is proven to be a cause for eating disorders. Setting boundaries and healthy expectations and limitations isnt the same as a diet. It's been proven that giving children autonomy over their meals helps them learn proper nutrition. Not in the sense of "eat anything you want in the fridge" but by providing say, their main meal alongside dessert, and letting them choose which to eat first. This takes away the power of the "forbidden" dessert, they learn to trust their body and figure out what it wants. Children aren't in control of what gets brought into the house. And while social determinants of health are definitely often at play, it remains the parents responsibility to both provide healthy food and lead by example.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, breathe, it's okay. This is entirely normal. When I recovered I was eating a LOT, i mean like 5-7 k calories A DAY for WEEKS. I had extreme hunger. It was terrifying. And I let myself eat. For a while, you may never feel full. Or you'll feel full, but mentally still want more and that's fine. It's scary, but I recovered this way, and I got healthier both mentally and physically pretty fast. I gained more than I wanted - I'll put a tw for details below, just numbers and stuff) I was about 10 pounds underweight, and gained 30. My body changed a lot, and it wasnt pleasant. BUT. My hunger evened out. The idea of binging wasnt appealing any more. And I did end up losing 10, but not through restriction, just by literally eating when i was hungry and whatever i wanted. I'm now at a very healthy weight and i FEEL good. I promise, your hunger will subside. If you deL with binging, that will also subside. The nighttime snacking will stop, and try to eat during the day. You've got this, and it is worth it. Give yourself several months. Your body will change and find its place.</TEXT>

I hate that people knew me "before", that I'm 21 and still have to go through the proper puberty. I dont feel proud. I hate that I must do this to feel okay. I wish I didnt . Feel like I'm overreacting. Making a scene, looking for attention. I hope one day I will feel proud.... but it wont be for being trans. Itll be because I overcame SO much shit just to be myself. Then i get irritated that I'll be proud of that cause like. Cis people just get to skip all of this. Maybe I have a lot of internalized transphobia/self hate oops.

    <TEXT>Since I started smoking I never really stopped. Started at 18, 21 now. At 20 I switched from oils to bongs and flower. That's when I really became an addiction and I didnt even realize it until I bought oil again and realized how different it was. I want to stop. I hate being dependent. I only smoke st night to help me sleep.... and I have so much anxiety over not being able to sleep without it .like so much. And idk why. I recognize that weed (in particular flower out of bongs/bubbles etc) keeps me stagnant in life. I have severe anxiety at times, and weed is always there so I can "deal with it later". It masks my depression. It serves a purpose. But I have an addictive personality and took advantage. Now I'm dependent. I tried quitting cold turkey several times. I think I will rely on my pens to help me sleep/ get used to not having such an intense high. I need to switch my mindset from "let's see how high I can get" back to "how much do I need st this time to address a specific issue". Hopefully this will allow me to cut back, and then quit altogether.</TEXT>

I think just pens may work bc it's what I used for 2 years medicinally, and had zero issues. I didnt feel dependent, it was literally 30 se ends before sleeping to physically relax my body. I do still see a medicinal value in that. (I'm also very aware this may be my brain convincing me it's not that harmful, so I'm paying attention to that). However, I'd like to be able to be completely sober again. I have s psych apt. In August and I'm going to ask for a sleeping aid, as this is the source of my anxiety around quitting weed. On my days off I'll try to go without, therefore if my sleep is fucked if doesnt matter, and I can prove that I can sleep fine without it. Sorry for the super long reply, but thank you for reading and writing back. I'm really serious about quitting this time. It's been long enough. And I'm in a huge period of transition in life anyways. I may as well find out the man I am without weed too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live with chronic suicidal ideation since the age of 10 or so. Over the years I've gotten so much better at not acting on impulse. But I dont remember the last time its been this bad. I cant think of anything else. I cant handle this blinding wall of pain that hits me, to the point where I'm shouting out loud "no, please no, I don't want to do that, I cant take this... etc". My self harm is out of control again. I keep hoping ill bleed out "accidentally". This is all a secret, my family thinks I've been better ever since I was hospitalized for 15 months at 13 years old. Its been so long now, I dont know how to bring it up thst I desperately need help. I know i dont truly want to die. Just 3 months ago I was excited for a new career path. But all of that doesn't seem to matter. I am a burden, I feel so heavy and sad. Nothing brings me joy and my anxiety prevents me from leaving my room. I do the same thing each day, doing the minimum to get by. I am in pure survival mode and I am not winning. I truly fear I will successfully attempt in the near future if this doesn't ease up. I'm so close to going to a hospital. But I genuinely xant tell my risk level. Like I said. I live with chronic suicidal thoughts. Thsts my baseline. Am I REALLY going to actually do it? Or am I just going to the emergency room looking like I'm an attention seeker because would I ACTUALLY do it? The thing is, I am so so close to actually doing it. But it scares me to think of exposing my secret, having everyone know, and being forced to uproot the life ivd tried to build due to my mental health. The shame of feeling suicidal is preventing me from seeking help. It would be easier to die. And it always comes back to this. Do I really want a lifetime of this? Maybe its best to just get it over with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah no problem. If packed tight probably .25-.4. I give myself wiggle room with it to be honest, and thsts how I maintain my rule of two bowls. I might fill it up halfway for one and then full for the second depending on my need. Sometimes I go down to one, other times 3. I just try to stick around 2 as thats enough for what I need ( sleep/anxiety/depression). It was mostly trial and error and being honest with myself about how much was needed (ex: well I had a stressful day so ill smoke 5 bowls back to back" isn't a good excuse lol). Sorry if I rambled lol. TLDR - about .25 or .4 if packed tight and full. Sorry never really weighed so just guestimsting</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tw self harm, suicidal ideation. Hi all. I'm nearly 22. I've struggled with self harm from 11-16 then off and on. I live with chronic suicidal ideation as well, among other things. I currently do not have access to therapy/psych (moved). I genuinely can't tell what my risk level is, and if I need to self admit. I am highly su*cidal. My self harm is out of control. I cant barely walk at work. I should be getting stitches but I always say "well you did it to yourself so". I cant control the self harm. Its in my head and I ruminate until I give in. I keep thinking "well if you cut your arms... thsts enough and you can go to the hospital (I have two sleeves covering up the self harm from years ago. I REALLY don't want to fuck up my tattoos or my arm. But the thought wont leave, and im pretty sure ill end up doing it in the next few weeks). Nobody knows anything. I'm living at home due to covid. I cant break my mothers heart. She doesn't know. The shame and guilt I feel is preventing me from getting help but if I don't get help I think I'm going to die, whether on purpose or from self harm. I cant make the choice to self admit as its not "bad enough". But there's been two times in the last month I was about to commit and by pure luck it was removed, the second time someone interupted. I booked a hotel to do it. Then a friend was in a crisis and I covered her shift thus canceling my hotel room. All this to say, I feel fucking stupid bc if I  #341;eally wanted to do it I would right? Here I am postponing desth/self harm to go to work or because someone came home. Am I a danger to myself? Like I know i am. But its all so impulsive. I can get through these episodes.... until the day that I won't be able to. And I know thsts coming soon.</TEXT>

And i keep thinking if I just wait, I can get through it. Because I've had this before, and I waited. And it went away and nobody had to know and it wasn't a big deal. Truly, I know this isn't okay but it is "normal" for me and I dont want to traumatized myself entering the same hospital I was at 10 years ago. I dont want medical attention with drs who look down on me because I'm wasting their time (again). I cant miss work, ill be laid off. Like if I go to the hospital that's it. I cant take it back its all out there and my life will drastically change and I dotn want to let go of what I've tried to make. Although I spoke to an old nurse who was there when I was ip and she did say it would be the quickest way to get therapy/psych/ HRT referral. So I don't know</TEXT>

Second time, the object I was looking for was moved. Third, well my grandmother came home before I could proceed. For the hotel I already explained. In my head though, none of this is severe because the first time  #236;f I REALLY meant it I would have taken the other things (someone else's medication and it felt wrong to fuck up their life/add guilt). Second time was stupid rummaging through someone else's house. Third if i really wanted to my grandmother being home wouldn't have mattered. And I wouldn't have covered a shift. So to me, im bot a danger bc in this moment I am not currently dying. Im sorry if thst was too much</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In short, yes. Although I deal with various mental health issues, I feel the root of me feeling "wrong" is being trans. I felt lonely and different growing up too. Dsyphoria for me is this deep, pervasive sense of being wrong. My body is uncomfortable; it feels like a prison thst i just want to escape. And after actually trying to escape several times and surviving, this adds to a sense of me not meant to be here. However, logically I understand I/ we are meant to be here, our existence is not a mistake or fluke. We just have different lived experience than cis people. The question of "maybe im not trans im just _____" furthers this process of feeling alien or unnatural. You are meant to be here and to exist. As for your wife. I'm not sure how long you've been together, or if it was a sudden thing she found out. It takes time for others to process. However, even if she doesn't process it well, that is on her, not you. It doesn't make your reality wrong or fake. It doesn't erase you being trans. It wasnt a mistake to tell her. I'm not sure how far along you are in your transition. I'm pre medical (but in the process!) But have socially transitioned and ill just tell you this. Although I still struggle with dsyphoria a lot, and my questioning of my existence, I have never felt more like myself, more whole, and more right. This sense of wrongness or not being meant to exist IS relieved, at least for me and many other trans people ivd talked to. There is hope</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, well you don't have to reach a breaking point. Thsts just what happened to me. Focus on doing the things thst make you feel better. If the thought of being trans is too much/scary/whatever, throw thst out. You're learning who YOU are. You don't need labels. Do some non-permenant things that may make you feel... different? Better? You can even do it in secret, like I did. I'm ftm, but you could you could try putting on makeup, wearing fem clothes, trying to raise your voice, tucking, shaving, etc. None of this is permanent or anything others need to know about. If it turns out the same for you as it was for me, something clicked and I realized even if I'm not trans, I would never go back to wearing women's clothes or having long hair again. Ill never not wear a binder out. And even if I wasnt a binary trans guy, I still would've been much happier learning to feel comfortable in my expression.</TEXT>

I would wear binders during sex, sometimes my boxers. Many times I broke down crying because I wanted to be there for her and make her happy but sacrificed my own comfort. I even suggested she see other people for sex (was a no go lol). Idk how your bf is, but just know that its very possible sex can be/is tough for him.

    <TEXT>Where I live its legal, so that helps. I smoke daily, less than 1g. I do struggle with various mental health issues and need to be mindful of using it to escape. With that being said, weed WORKS for me. Better than any other medication. I used to be on 7+ meds a day from 13 to 16. Now I'm down to 1 antidepressant and weed. To argue my case to others, I basically explain that I would rather be "addicted/dependent" on weed than be on so many drugs so im no longer myself, miserable and still struggling. I am more productive, more stable, etc when I consume weed. Thats just how it is and if they don't like it then sorry. Its legal. I was an honor roll student with a 4.2 GPA. I am successful at work. There are no downsides to weed except for when I overdo it. But that would be the same with any medication.</TEXT>

Especially as you're not some 15 year old blazing every day just to get high. And less than 2 g a day too.

    <TEXT>To be completely honest, I was in a similar position a few weeks ago. From 10-16 was in treatment. Got better till a few years ago (18-21) but didn't tell anyone. It got to a point where I had to go to the hospital. I wasn't pleased, I expected to be retraumatized at the very least. What do you know, after speaking with the psych I had a new dr, a med review/change/ a therapy appointment, and a referral to an endocrinolgiist (im trans). And they didn't even suggest keeping me. Long story short, seeking help as an adult is freeing, you feel you have autonomy and are more in charge of what's going on. They aren't telling you what to do anymore, they provide you options and you have to decide whats best for you. By no means am I saying you need to go to the hospital (idk your situation), i was just trying to convey my recent experience feeling a similar way.</TEXT>

There is no way to ignore the fact that humans are collectively going through a traumatic experience due to the pandemic. It makes complete sense thst you are feeling this way- you even know the source. And things may be okay, but they aren't the same. We are living in heightened anxiety and worry. People with preexisting mental health issues are reaching crises, and many people who didnt experienced mental health issues are now. That exhaustion, the sleeping, the drained feeling, wondering why you can't just get it together... that sounds like depression. I would seek counselling to be honest.

    <TEXT>Hi, trans guy here. I came out this year at 21. While I did so as an adult and it is probably very different as a youth, the biggest thing you can do for him is be there for him to talk to. Its an entire process for the individual too. Its confusing and scary, so having a parent would help. Educate yourself as much as you can on trans issues, especially with children. Miles McKenna has a video called "show this to your parents" and its 5 parents of trans kids describing their reactions and what helped their child. I know it takes time (my family still arent 100% with name/pronoun), but a HUGE thing you can/should so is use the correct pronouns/ name he chooses to go by. The way I describe it, its like a papercut each time someone refers to me as she/her or my birth name. Abd over the course of the day those papercuts add up.</TEXT>
