    <TEXT>Not a worker but a customer who saw this happen. I went to EB games (Australian gamestop, also in some other country's) today and i went in to buy some xbox live gold because they were doing buy one three months of gold get one free and some apex coins (i didnt really care about the coins but it was a great deal). Anyways i see this women come in with her husband to get something for her son. Late 30s, looked like she hated being a parent. She put an white xbox one controller on the desk and asked for a refund because "apparently" it was broken when she got it . I hear this and have a little peak over at this controller. the controller looks beaten up though some 9 year old fortnite rage and has the right thumb stick missing. Now the lady serving her, happens to be the manager. she is the most terrifying person you'll ever meet. She's in her mid 40s, Has half her hair shaved, the rest colored blue and always looks like she could tear you to shreds with her pinky. Shes not having it and says "there's no way thats a manufacturing issue. That was clearly broken by your son." The lady and her husband give up knowing theres no way in hell they're getting a new one for free and they buy their son. Reluctantly a new cheap wired controller then leave. I can tell the manager feeds off these kind of people and loves telling them that they're wrong and watching the hope drip out of their eyes thinking getting a free replacement for their sons controller which he needs to learn to take care of I don't understand how kids break so many things so easily just dont throw your expensive electrical devices it's that simple.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-22 04:49:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ice ruins any drink. For an example i got an orange juice with 3 ice cubes in it a few days ago. Now i didnt want to drink it because the ice would get in the way and make my mouth cold, and im not gonna be a pig and stick my entire hand in and fish the stupid cold cubes out. So i wait and wait and come back to the drink and then it tastes like shitty slightly orangey water. Before anyone says "It keeps it cold" Fuck you. it doesnt take me 3 hours to drink a glass of orange juice, that i can down in 20 seconds. And dont even get me fucking started on Mcdonalds making your drink 97.3% ice and 2.7% actual drink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should definitely seek help from a professional but its good that you're spending most of your time improving yourself instead of locking yourself away and loathing yourself. Maybe try to find another hobby or activity to do. But try to get help. Depression is a terrible thing which gets way worse if you just ignore it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive been playing guitar for 2 years now and over the months have been writing songs. Whenever im doing anything theres a little voice in the back of my head saying that i should be writing/playing instead of anything else because thats the only way im ever going to get good at music or write anything good. Lately ive been writing a song at least half a song every night and i cant seem to write anything that doesnt sound genetic or uninspired. Its really taking a toll on my enjoyment of music. Does anyone have any advice or similar situations they want to talk about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I may of found the best non scuff controller binds</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-08 07:39:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Combat controls Y - toggle pickace X - previous weapon (to the left) B - switch mode A - next weapon (to the right) right stick - Edit left stick - Jump Left bumper - Reload/interact Right bumper - Crouch Same Ads and shoot buttons. Bulid: Same as usual Just edit and jump as Right and left stick like before Editing: Left trigger - confirm. As the same Ive been crafting a control scheme like this for months now and ill expain how it works So basically i switched the "switch weapon" binds with the "Editing and interacting" binds This minimises how much you have to take your thumbs off the sticks. The only thing you have to take them off for is switching weapons, switch mode, and toggle pickaxe. If you always have to take your thumbs off the sticks. Then your fingers will get tired and you wont be able to aim for short periods of time. Same with movement. Now as for the confirm this makes it soooooo easy to edit. Even if you hate this control scheme you should definitely change your confirm button The triggers are too useful to not be used. Anyways please rate this and give me tips and feedback on these controls ~ Epicfortniter21 the bind destroyer.</TEXT>

To keep the 9 year old normies playing: if epic lowers the skillcap of the game it means little timmy gets more #1 victory royales. Meaning he spends more of mommys money on Vbucks. But if timmy keeps being clapped by xXTTVDarkScrubLordXx hes gonna play something else. And spend his money... somewhere else. 2. Epic is just trolling and hysterically lauging at this subreddit.

    <TITLE>13 reasons why is disgusting and in no way should represent mental health</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-29 23:56:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>13 reasons why is the an absolutely awful Netflix which claims to be "meant to start a conversation" so much this show gets terribly wrong and had a 3rd season come out which it definitely didnt need. The moral of the show should be: if you commit suicide, you die. you don't into fortnite spectator mode and people forget and move on. No one starts seeing you as a ghost randomly and hunts down your "mystery". I mutually knew someone who commited sucide who went to a school near me and no one talks about her anymore, she didnt becone famous or have a cute boy look for her clues. its too sad and people move on with their lives. The worst thing is i see people encouraging teens to watch it to educate them which so many other shows/movies do this better. The only reason it got renewed for a 3rd season was money, fuck this show.</TEXT>

Not the change the subject but the fashion/makeup industries really put all these ideas into young womens heads that they cant be naturally beautiful. and no matter how many times i tell her "bruh you look the same amount of beautiful with it or without make up" is crazy. And dont even get me started on all those Kardashians. looking like Barbie dolls. Like if i wanted someone like that i would go to japan and get a weird sex robot.

And ive having a lot of trouble writing while using scales, modes, and progression roman numeral number stuff (im new sorry about my awful terminology.) Im just wondering what how people can write good rifts and power chord progressions consistently. and not feeling like they have to wait for the rift fairy to come down once or twice a month to bless me with a cool song. https://youtu.be/UooWrWg5sIc Example of something ive writen.</TEXT>

I opened one of my blueprints and got a rare and saw I could pay 100 creds and I thought "oh so you can see what you get before you pay that's great pro consumer move" this way it still keeps the excitement and rarity of getting an item. But not paying for shit I don't want. But playing 30 bucks for a black market. That takes away all value from any item ironiclly. Because it isn't rarity that makes it rare, it's now just cash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It just doesn't feel like too many big strides are made every year. Games like R6 or fortnite Feel so ironed out and when you look back at the start of the year you go "damn this is so much better" and "I'm glad they fixed that thing". Making seasons longer would be a better fix even if they cost more money (as long as they have more content). And adding something big almost every season would make updates exciting and bring tons of attention and player retention to the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Has supercell ever consider putting clash Royale on PC. It would really grow the player base and I don't see any competitive advantages to playing on PC. I have a friend who plays a lot on PC using an emulator and it works just fine. You can even bind the card slots to keys making it easy to switch which is an awesome feature. Just a little menu revamp and some crossplay and it prints money. Edit: and before people say BlueStacks I'm talking about it natively</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-11 08:02:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>It feels like once you get full highest tier gear and beaten the dragon that the game becomes easy mode with nothing intrinsic to do. I think a new "survivor mode" with more mobs. Thirst meter, and other mechanics to make the game more like other survival games and rouge like elements. Stuff like there's a 10 percent chance when you get bit by a zombie you will get infected, and you'll have to craft a cure out of rotten flesh to not slowly turn into a zombie. Or random boss battles with mega mobs. A day counter on the top of the map and an updated permadeath mode. I think their stuff should be a "regular survival mode" for people who prefer for more chilled out traditional Minecraft survival and don't always want to be fighting for their life. This game could use some for challenge and intrinsic value and I think I would never stop playing it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My interpretation of lucky</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-29 01:28:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lucky has always stood out to me as one of Radiohead's best written songs. I heard it for the first time when I was stuck in a relationship. The girl I was dating was extremely dependent on me for everything. I was really the only person she could talk to. she was paranoid about all of her friends hated her and that I was "in love" with all of them because I said hi on the bus or something. We didn't have too much in common and dating her felt like a chore. What kept me there?. Feeling like I was the only one who could "pull her out of the air crash" i was the only one who could save her. "Because I was her superhero when she was on the edge". This feeling of needing to save her knowing that no one would if it wasn't for me. Lets look at the lyrics closer. I'm on a roll I'm on a roll this time I feel my luck could change Kill me Sarah Kill me again with love It's gonna be a glorious day Anyone who's ever been in this kind of toxic relationship can agree that you're always searching for a light at the end of the tunnel. Wanting for the relationship to get better even though you know that it isn't magically gonna get better. This feeling of knowing that one day, "your luck is going to change" and everything is going to be better. Whether it's by you too miraculously separating or or even more miraculously getting better. A lot of the time the "manipulator" doesn't even know they're doing it. With my ex partner she was unintentionally taught these behaviours by the people she grew up with. She's loving you with all her heart and doesn't realise how much she's damaging you and unintentionally manipulating you into staying. The narrator has accepted this reality of feeling unhappy but being his partners "superhero" and is wanting to be killed by it.... For it to end. "Kill me Sarah with love It's going to be a glorious day"... when this relationship ends and I'm free again Ive already mostly described the course but I'll go over it again Course Pull me out of the air crash Pull me out of the lake 'Cause I'm your superhero When your standing on the edge If you look at the lucky single artwork you can see an image of a plane crashing down with the words "love story" on it. This to me, confirms my theory of this being about a manipulative relationship other than an real plane crash. This is the narrator asking to be pulled out of this relationship like a plane crash. Something that no one can predict, violently and quickly. Because he's tired of being this person's superhero and needing to save her when "she's standing on the edge" This line has always got to me. Ending of a B7 makes it feel very unstable. This line could be referring to her threatening to take her own life. The other way this can be interpreted is this is the partner asking to be pulled out an unpleasant feeling which can only be solved by her "superhero" coming to save her like I expressed in the 2nd paragraph. This can go both ways. While the partner is asking to be pulled out of this anxiety and saved by the "superhero narrator". the narrator wants to be pulled out of this relationship but can't leave due to this feeling that he needs to be there to save her.

    <TEXT>Radiohead is 5 English dudes who make some cool ass music. I don't think most songs are as deep as people pretend they are. I can tell when lyrics are there because they sound good and shouldn't be taken too literally. But often it's the feeling the lyrics give which paints the picture for the song. Like, sit down. Stand up off hail to the thief's the raindrops part was just there because it sounds good Eg. paranoid Android is just a song about a bad night at the bar with a crazy lady.</TEXT>

Or you can be there thinking "hey, I remember when this random Redditor recommended me this song I loved it" and remember even in the darkest of times, even on your death bed. humans can work together and be good for the sake of it. And as you enter those pearly Gates, this memory will be on your videotape.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to play a lot of Pokemon TCGO and one thing I always liked about that game were the ticket tournaments. Basically you pay a preset amount of tickets ranging from E.G 4-24 and get increasing awards for the amount you pick. 16 person knockout tournament. If you get knocked out first you win a lightning chest or something around that value. Up to a king's chest for 1st in the more expensive tournament. LVL 9 standard and you can get the tickets from chests, daily challenges, events the pass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The show feels completely dead right now and has no structure. I love these guys but it sounds like they need a break and it's super run down. After seeing Charlie on misfits actually talking and having fun it reminded me of episodes 1-100 and how fun they were specially the really early ones like "naked dumpster diving". They don't really seem like friends anymore, more colleagues. I felt really bad when a few episodes back they were talking about how they should have movie nights to get closer again. I think the show needs a break and a bit more structure. This really is my favourite podcast and I would hate to see it slowly get more rundown.</TEXT>
