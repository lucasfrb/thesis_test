    <TEXT>The sister of my new kitten has not been bought yet despite all of her littermates having been bought (they #8217;re 9 weeks now), she #8217;s 90% black with a few white spots and white socks, so I #8217;m wondering if black purebreds are less wanted? Do they get less points at shows etc? Edit: I live in Norway EditEdit: So does the cats #128517;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, her two sisters (one bought by me) and brother are all tiger, one ns 09 23, the other two n 09 23. She #8217;s the only back cat despite their father being black. She #8217;s probably not good for shows because she #8217;s black, and people that  #8220;just want a cat #8221; are unlikely to spend 845 #8364; ish on a black pedigree kitten when she looks  #8220;normal #8221;, is my guess. The breeder will give the black kitten to us for a slightly reduced price if nobody buys her, so I #8217;m kind of hoping nobody buys her so I can keep her :3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New to fostering and Fostering possible semi-feral - what is the best way to use a feeding schedule?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-23 17:55:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>After my cat died I decided to foster while waiting for my new kitten to reach 12 weeks (she #8217;s with her mother still). I #8217;ve just taken in a 2,5 year old male cat (has been neutered and given vaccines already by the shelter, weighs approximately 5,5-6kg) from his previous foster home, she told me he #8217;s still scared and does not want to be touched - but that he just growls a bit or swats, no aggression. She #8217;s getting a puppy and therefore he had to be moved (to me). Before she got him, another family had him and told the shelter to come pick him up again because he was a trouble maker etc etc (though when the shelter picked him up again he was calm, so who knows what they did to him). The previous foster home (a woman in her 30 #8217;s) had him for a month, and he was probably picked up from the cat colony around 1,5-2 months ago, and then he had been fed by a man watching the colony for ~1 year. He doesn #8217;t run away inside, and sits in a large dog cage in the living room (covered 2 sides with blankets, door open at day) at my place for now, when he is more confident to roam freely inside he can do so if he wishes. Right now, ~6h after his arrival he is stilled curled up in his smaller carrier cage inside the big cage (he sees the small carrier as his safe space), and has not drunken any water or eaten when I have provided salmon paste (on a looong spoon so he has his distance), he just sniffed it a bit and then backed up a little after a few minutes. I am going to remove today #8217;s  #8220;dinner kibble #8221; soon (after it #8217;s been there for a few hours) How do I best utilise a feeding schedule to socialise him more with me? I have no intentions of even touching him until he is ready, but should I remove the food bowl from the cage when I get up from the floor, and then put it back down at the next feeding time? If so - how long should I let the kibble be left out for him? I #8217;m planning on doing kibble breakfast (around 10.00) and wet food dinner (around 18/19.00), possibly evening kibble at 23.00 (or kibble - kibble - wet food) I hope my text isn #8217;t too messy, and thanks in advance for tips and advice, I #8217;ll answer questions about him in the comments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He has lived in another foster home for 1 month, so he eats dry food just fine, and wet food, today he didn #8217;t want any food up until his evening meal (at 23.00) and then he started eating a bit between 00.00 and 01.00 while I was watching tv. He only ate around 5 gram I believe, which is not a lot, so tomorrow I #8217;m giving him 25g for his breakfast and we will see how that goes. Right now he isn #8217;t particularly happy of me moving things around in his large dog cage. I put in a small scratching post as I noticed he was looking for something to scratch on (and ended up playing with his litter instead as there was nothing). He has a selection of his toys in the cage. He is getting a bit fat, so the shelter wanted me to put him on diet food if I wasn #8217;t watching how much he was eating, but changing dry food 3 times in a week is a bit too much even for the toughest stomachs. Now he eats Royal Canin Calm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It feels so good when your semi-feral foster starts playing a bit with the toy without seeming very afraid, he focused on the toy a lot of the time instead of me. Today we moved further and he accepted being stroked over the head and neck with the feathers, and when I scratched under the chin he leaned into it a little :D He has come a long way despite having moved to my place on Thursday (having been in 2 other foster homes before me, sadly they couldn #8217;t keep him for different reasons so we offered to take him in since we can keep him for however long he needs). Thursday he hid in his smaller carrier constantly, but we managed to move him over to a larger one we have, which he seems to appreciate now. We took off the lid of the larger carrier Friday evening, since there were blankets covering 50% of the large cage. He did not like it when I leaned into the cage to fix his litter box, water and food, though yesterday he understood I am not going to touch him when I do those things. Yesterday we got to the point where we played a little, for maybe half an hour he swatted after and caught the feather toy (in a playful manner), having all his attention on that, ears forward and body relaxed. Today I received no growling when I took the litter box and changed the water, only a glare with ears somewhat forward but still anxious. We attempted to play a bit, but he wasn #8217;t in the mood, though he swatted a few times after the toy before laying back down. He allowed me to stroke the top of his head and his neck without growling or staring, instead he closed his eyes and relaxed. When we got to chin scratches he leaned his head out a bit (like cats do when you scratch their chin), and seemed to somewhat enjoy it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My two pedigree girls, now 13,5 weeks old, weigh 1.8kg and 1.9/2kg, they weighed 1.35 and 1.45 when they got to me at 11,5 week (after agreement with the breeder). They have gained 500g in the span of 2 weeks, and I #8217;ve read everywhere that they should just gain 100-150g a week... Should I be worried? Am I feeding them too much? They eat wet food 3 times a day but they don #8217;t really like the kitten wet food so they get a little raw meat instead (VOM Kattemat) about once a day (they love it, it #8217;s specially made for cats and is a complete food meaning they can eat only that and not have any issues with vitamins or taurin etc). They eat obvious smaller amounts of kibble when they are given VOM. They eat RC kitten dry food and are fed RC paediatric growth wet food.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-27 16:42:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m kind of new to.. a community like this, I #8217;ve kept it to myself for a couple of years, and It seems like it #8217;s more common to go for places like thighs, stomach, etc. than arms? I #8217;m curious as for the reason why, personally I #8217;ve never touched my legs in that way (other than skin picking because gotta get those ingrown hairs after waxing. Pick on my upper arms too :/) Is it because it #8217;s easier to hide (both yeets and scars)? Or for other reasons? I always try to keep it so shallow that I won #8217;t get a lasting scar, I have an odd mind in many ways and several other problems, which I #8217;m in therapy to figure out right now actually, but please share your opinions on the matter, it #8217;s interesting to know what others think of it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Huh... interesting. I guess I just, never really considered my  #8220;options #8221; as I was very young the first time and went for the first I could find and stuck with it, and I don #8217;t have to go as deep to see the red streaks (I think, I have not tried thighs but I also have cats that love jumping on my lap so...). It gives an escape when there #8217;s too much, though I #8217;m noticing I #8217;m sometimes doing it just to do it now, like it #8217;s becoming an addiction for me. My yeets are almost always fully healed in 2 weeks and not very noticeable anymore after one week, and forms scabs overnight. But now recently, before I #8217;ve managed to stay clean for a few days after a week of doing it every day, I had 34 yeets nicely lined up from wrist to about 1/2 up my forearm. I guess it #8217;s the not-diagnosed-ocd that makes me want to keep it perfectly lined I feel like I #8217;m lesser worth though as others do it more often and deeper, but I also know it #8217;s not a competition of any sorts. It messes with my head tbh</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m starting to get back into photography, my phone has always been my go to but I see that my DSLR Canon EOS 1000D w/ 18-55mm starting kit lens gets better results (than iPhone 7...). I #8217;m mostly photographing my cats/kittens, but I #8217;m looking to upgrade to a newer camera for better shutter speed, iso, etc etc, I #8217;ll also buy one or two new lenses (along with the one I get with the new camera). My price range is max 700-800 usd for the camera itself as I #8217;m going to save up for lenses as well (thinking of getting a 50mm f/1.8 Lens first). It has to be a canon camera that supports EF/EF-S lenses as I have mostly canon stuff otherwise and compatibility is nice :D Key words: cat, motion, indoor and outdoor, low light and good outdoor light... I #8217;ll also use it for other things, ex: horses in motion, dogs in motion, still portraits, but the cats are the main focus as I take pictures for their Instagram. I #8217;ve been looking at the Canon SL3 (250D) but I #8217;m wondering if there are any better options within my price range, i don #8217;t know a lot about cameras but I #8217;m frantically researching to learn more. Any tips and/or advice is highly appreciated!</TEXT>

When I have it on shutter speed 1/1000 (usually used for birds) and iso to 800, and f/ lowest possible, I still can #8217;t manage to get a clean whisker shot unless they are sitting completely still. I was looking around online and the 250D was suggested as a starting camera for pet photography with a 24-70mm or 50mm portrait lens, another suggested was the 5DS R, but that is way too expensive for me. Another pro of the 250D is that I #8217;ll be able to shoot videos as well, which I can #8217;t on my 13 year old 1000D I don #8217;t know how much the megapixel difference has to say but I imagine going from 10 to 24/25 would make a difference?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, thank you The problem with the shutter speed is that I get completely black pictures if I go above 200/400 even with iso set to 1600 :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ll have to start bringing a flashlight with me hehe I see how some other cat owners have really dark photos, but then manage to edit hem to be nice and bright without more grain, though I get a lot of grain if I try to brighten a dark photo. Will not a newer camera have better  #8220;less grain with higher iso setting #8221;? I read about a lot of cameras and some say they have iso up to 52k and with minimal grain, isn #8217;t that technically better than a lot of grain at 1600? I need a new camera anyways because mine is getting old and doing odd stuff at times, so I #8217;m just trying to find the best camera within my budget while knowing a good les changes everything as well. The video recording isn #8217;t a must, but considering most of the newer cameras has it, I might as well get one with good specs. The LS3 (250D) is being sold for 588 usd in a store nearby. I have to save up a bit anyways</TEXT>
