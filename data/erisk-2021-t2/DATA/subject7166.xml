You start the game with a very simple one: VGA and a low number of colors. You have to get the SVGA one to get better quality and the Videocard with 8 MB of memory to get the best one.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tutorial how use ProgressDOS in Progressbar95</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-04 12:26:16</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; https://reddit.com/link/e5yhnl/video/91ylok9r0m241/player Here is a small video to demonstrate how to use ProgressDOS. The idea is simple: use DIR to display a list of files, use CD to enter a directory. For example you want to open DOCUMENTS, just type: CD DOCUMENTS. Then enter DIR to display files inside that folder. To execute EXE and TXT files, type their full name, for example README.TXT. To leave directory type CD .. In the video you can see that in the directory DOCUMENTS/FILES was BONUS.EXE with a bonus of 7000 points inside. Each time you start the game locations of bonuses and cheats are changed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Let's talk about the craziest bonus in the game. First of all you need a fresh version of the app: 0.502 (Android) or 0.512 (iOS). Then try to create a pattern: _ _ _ _ . (9) . . . . . (5) where blue-blue pair is a dash, but yellow-blue is a dot. The idea of this bonus was born in the community!</TITLE>

    <TEXT>You can use them again in a ten days or so. You have ten slots per each code category, for example 10 slots for godmode codes. Once you've used ten codes, you have to wait a day for a new slot to appear, the game removes a very first code from your list, so you may use it again after that.</TEXT>
