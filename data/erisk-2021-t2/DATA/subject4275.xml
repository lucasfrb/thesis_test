My mother sewed lots of our clothes, made home made bread, canned, raised a big garden and could hunt and fish better than most men. She saved my life when I fell in a canal and was headed for a cement flue and she nursed me back to health more than a few times and slipped me a few dollars to do something fun when Dad wasn't looking.

    <TEXT>I grew up on a working farm and we raised animals and crops for our own use but also to sell/trade to pay for farm implements and property taxes and hopefully make a little profit to reinvest. I am semi-retired now and I don't want to be tied to taking care of a herd of animals and I downsized from a 15 acre ranch to my 1 acre ranchette to cut down on the work. I lease out the pastures to help pay property taxes and keep it from getting overgrown. I still enjoy raising animals and I have free range chickens because I can leave them for a few weeks to travel and they will take care of themselves. I grow a smaller garden now since my kids are all grown and have families of their own. I still make money from my homestead by writing about off-grid living, simple cabin building and the off grid lifestyle so essentially my homestead is paying for itself and gives me the freedom to go adventuring and try new things on the homestead. So, I am curious why people are getting in to homesteading and is it to be self-sufficient or make a profit or a hobby or retirement plan?</TEXT>

One day I asked my Papa about the cabin and he got very sad and told me the story of why it was abandoned. It was in the late 1800's when this land was open to homesteading and many people moved west to get land and start a life but they were encroaching on land that had always been hunting grounds of the Native Americans and this cabin sits right on hunting grounds used by several bands of Ute and Navajo Indians. The Indians generally got along with homesteaders and would trade meat and horses for sugar and flour but if times were hard they were not above taking a sheep or cow to keep from starving. The Homesteaders just accepted this and didn't try to stop them because they understood they needed to get along or there would be trouble. The cabin was built by a young homesteader and his wife and toddler and he was raising sheep and in a bad winter a hunting party of Indians came in and stole a couple of his sheep. The young homesteader flew angry and he got some of his buddies and they tracked the sheep back to the hunting parties camp and a fight broke out and the homesteaders shot and killed a couple of the Indians. They buried the bodies in shallow graves which is taboo for the Indians that have certain ways they handle their dead and it would mean their spirits would not go to the after life. They thought that would scare them off and it did but a few days after the homesteader and his family didn't show up to church so some of the men that had heard about about the fight went to the cabin and nothing was touched in the cabin and the sheep were still grazing in the field but they found the homesteader and his family all killed and laid in the root cellar. Those were different times and homesteading had a lot of risks and hardships we hopefully never have to experience.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-14 01:11:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK, if you don't know who Lloyd Kahn is you have been missing out but he is the photographer publisher that has published books about cabins and unique homes since the 60's and a pioneer of the green building and green architecture movement. I read all of his books starting as a teen and my own cabin was inspired by a black and white sketch in one of his books. A few years ago out of the blue he contacted me and asked if he could include my cabin in his book "Shelter" and of course I said yes and was honored to have the author I looked up to as a teen want my cabin for one of his books. Today Lloyd emailed me to get my address to send his latest (and hopefully not last) book as he is 85 now and he is sending that to me personally. I don't know the subject matter but I am sure it will be great like all his books and I will do a write up and video when it comes. His books were/are a great inspiration to me and off gridders and cabin builders around the world so look him up online or get a copy of his books at your library.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Raising Homestead Dogs Around Your Animals</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-16 12:58:48</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; [Tazaroo loves a good mud hole](https://preview.redd.it/bolmv1xug4z41.jpg?width=640 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=82390a7ad09ef0dc601df1da79b61c89cf0c287d) I have always had homestead dogs and raised probably 15 of them in my life time to be around animals and work as herd, property protection and companions. I only get very young pups when I get a dog because they have to be trained from a very young age to respect the other animals on the homestead and invariably they will be curious and chase a chicken or get running after an animal and have to be reprimanded and if done early they learn and won't bother them again. In general just a harsh tongue lashing showing how displeased you are is enough as you are the pack leader and they want your acceptance. I free range my chickens and we have calves and other animals all around this area so dogs have to be trained to stay on their own property and most people here do not kennel their dogs. If a dog gets on to someone's property here and they have farm animals the dog is likely to get shot. My brother recently got an older pup that was not raised around other animals and has taken to wandering down to my place and yesterday was chasing the chickens and I had to grab the rake and put a stop to that and took him back home. Needless to say we had a discussion about his dog. So consider carefully when getting a homesteader dog if you have the time and strength to be a pack leader and can train and correct a dog so it is an asset to your homestead and not a liability to you and your neighbors. There is no such thing as a bad dog and they have natural instincts to hunt and chase down prey and it is up to you to train them to ignore that instinct and take on a role as a protector of the homestead and your other animals.</TEXT>

The addition could be used for a master bedroom, office, gamer room or to expand the kitchen and bathroom areas and could be made 8x12 and run the length of the cabin to double the floor space. I will put an open deck in front of that addition for outside entertaining and the sliding doors are optional and just for ideas. New Cabin Design: Walden 8x12 Sneak Peak This is the Walden cabin and is 8x12 and designed to be easy to build and under $2,000 for off grid, recreation, accessory dwelling unit or emergency homeless housing. It has a 1 or 2 bunk beds and a loft full size bed and a kitchen, bathroom, and living area. At under 100sqft this can be built most places without a permit. I am putting the plans together now and should have them available by end of May 2020. I am still doing the finish work on this design and if you have ideas put them in a comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't let your fears or other people hold you back from your dreams. After a near drowning accident as a boy I was afraid of deep water and didn't learn to swim properly. In college I forced myself to take swim lessons to overcome that fear and then became a lifeguard and swimming instructor and taught thousands of kids like me how to swim and be safe around water. I was told by friends and family that I couldn't start a business and make it in our small town but I started a pest control business and handed out flyers all over town and within a year I had over 250 regular customers and that business was well respected and was very successful and allowed me to semi-retire at 49. I was told I couldn't build an off grid cabin and the county would stop me and solar wouldn't work . That was almost 20 years ago and I have been thriving off grid in my cabin just fine. That cabin allows me to live without house payments and utility bills and more than pays for itself and led me to writing and sharing my off grid life with others. All my life I have had fears and other people that told me I couldn't do this or that and I faced them all down and proved them wrong so don't let your own fears or other people ever hold you back from your dreams.

    <TITLE>Lessons building cabins learned the hard way</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 10:13:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Having built my own off grid cabin and helped construct several cabins over the years I would like to offer suggestions so you can avoid some of my mistakes and lessons learned the hard way. 1- Start with a solid foundation. Whether it is a permanent or above ground the soil needs to be compacted and firm and not spongy or prone to flooding. Different areas require different foundations and some counties do not allow a permanent foundation for a dry cabin unless you are building a code house. All foundations settle a little but you don't want your cabin to be all skiwampus. 2- Spend extra money on insulation. The best long term construction expense is insulation and will save you lots of money down the road. I prefer formaldehyde free batt insulation and at least R19 in roof and floor and R13 in walls and more if you are in cold country. Wear gloves, eye protection and long sleeves. 3- Get more hands. I built my cabin completely by myself and holding things in place while attaching them and moving large sheets of material by one person is hard and can be dangerous. For any heavy material or unit get some extra hands. 4- Ladders are the enemy. Ask any contractor and they will tell you the most dangerous tool you will use is a ladder. I had a 20 foot extension ladder decide to unlock and collapse while putting on roofing and a step ladder go wobbly and drop me 6 feet on to my already bad knee. Take the time to set a ladder for safety and stay off that damn top rung/step. Scaffolding must be stable. 5- Always use a vapor and wind barrier under your wall sheathing. Tyvec is good but expensive and before that was invented we used roofing felt stapled to the studs and works great. This allows the walls to breath and dry out from condensation but prevents cold and moisture penetration. 6- Don't rush. Most accidents happen when you rush so slow down and think ahead about safety as you tackle each part of the cabin. You won't be saving money if you cut off your fingers or fall from a ladder and end up in the hospital... or worse!</TEXT>

When I first went off grid full time in 2003 there was no information on solar and youtube wasn't around and the internet was only available at colleges and libraries in my town. The only solar panels available were made in China and imported by Harbor Freight and it cost me almost $400 for three 15 watt panels but it came with a controller and a couple of DC lights. I couldn't find deep cycle batts so I used old car batts and would also recharge them from my vehicle when I made a run to town for materials. My first off grid home was a 1965 fifteen foot camper and I lived in that and worked on clearing my old horse pasture land of all the sage brush, Russian olive trees and junk that had been left by family while I worked a part time job and saved money for something better. The camper was fine until winter and then I damn near froze to death. I learned a lot from that though and I incorporated a lot of the camper systems for water pumps, propane and lighting in to my cabin designs to make it self contained and suitable for off grid use. Today people are installing solar on their grid tied homes and I see vids on youtube of offgridders with 5K and 10K systems and big hard to heat and cool houses and I wonder if we are going the right direction. Now I have internet and lights and water in a well insulated cabin that is paid for and my system is just 400 watts with 3 AGM batts I can afford to replace when they expire. Times have certainly changed and I just hope it is for the better! #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Half-Acre Homestead by Lloyd Kahn  amp;Leslie Creed: book review</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-26 22:21:20</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; [by Llloyd Kahn and Lesley Creed](https://preview.redd.it/87nut4ycp6151.jpg?width=260 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=46a9cef79dedc2d42d86921d1db4136e5e0dfabe) I first came to know Lloyd Kahn's work as a teenager and he was one of the hippie Mother Earth News underground and laid back photographer/writers that inspired many a young person like me to think about sustainable living, off grid living and caring about the planet. So you can imagine how honored I was when he asked to include my cabin and homestead in his book tiny houses simple shelter. It is like your hero asking you to play for his team. Anyway, Lloyd is now 85 and he has put out his new (and hopefully not last) book called The Half Acre Homestead and sent me a copy to review and like all his books the photography is absolutely stunning. This book is chock full of pics and short explanations of his own homestead with Lesley Creed starting from 1974 with everything from his homestead cabin, workshop, tools, garden and hundreds of projects that any DIY homesteader can learn from. " **This is the story of Lloyd and Lesley building a home and establishing a garden on a small piece of land on the Northern California Coast over a 46-year period.** Lloyd, the former shelter editor of the *Whole Earth Catalog*, has published seven books on owner building, showcasing hundreds of builders, and this is his first book on his own work. Starting with a vacant half-acre piece of land, they built their own home, created a garden with vegetables and fruit, and describe raising chickens, bees, and goats. The book also covers cooking, foraging, fishing, crafts, birds, butterflies, and tools. Their main theme is that this was all done by hand. They have never paid rent nor have they ever had a mortgage. There are over 500 photos illustrating all the above facets of their lives and clear explanations of building skylights, maintaining a septic system, building greenhouses and raised vegetable beds. There is a section on unique kitchen tools, as well as advice on useful tools used in construction." This is a great book for homesteaders, off gridders or anyone that enjoys photography of nature and things made by hand and would be a great addition for your personal library. You can get it on Amazon or www.shelterpub.com</TEXT>

So you can imagine how honored I was when he asked to include my cabin and homestead in his book tiny houses simple shelter. It is like your hero asking you to play for his team. Anyway, Lloyd is now 85 and he has put out his new (and hopefully not last) book called The Half Acre Homestead and sent me a copy to review and like all his books the photography is absolutely stunning. This book is chock full of pics and short explanations of his own homestead with Lesley Creed starting from 1974 with everything from his homestead cabin, workshop, tools, garden and hundreds of projects that any DIY homesteader can learn from. " **This is the story of Lloyd and Lesley building a home and establishing a garden on a small piece of land on the Northern California Coast over a 46-year period.** Lloyd, the former shelter editor of the *Whole Earth Catalog*, has published seven books on owner building, showcasing hundreds of builders, and this is his first book on his own work. Starting with a vacant half-acre piece of land, they built their own home, created a garden with vegetables and fruit, and describe raising chickens, bees, and goats. The book also covers cooking, foraging, fishing, crafts, birds, butterflies, and tools. Their main theme is that this was all done by hand. They have never paid rent nor have they ever had a mortgage. There are over 500 photos illustrating all the above facets of their lives and clear explanations of building skylights, maintaining a septic system, building greenhouses and raised vegetable beds. There is a section on unique kitchen tools, as well as advice on useful tools used in construction." This is a great book for homesteaders, off gridders or anyone that enjoys photography of nature and things made by hand and would be a great addition for your personal library.

    <TEXT>[Mortgage Lifter 'mater in my old tub](https://preview.redd.it/ifl3lp38m7151.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=0789a0a8661ef55a13ea9b4d26feaf9063a32364) I always plant 'maters and like to try new varieties but being just me these days I get only a a few plants and this year I am trying this Mortgage Lifter which is an heirloom variety so you can save the seeds and is supposed to be great for sandwiches. Normally I get smaller plants or start from seeds but because our growing season is shorter than most I have started paying a little more for better developed plants that are in bloom as they are a few weeks ahead and can grow some varieties that would struggle to produce here. I did buy some Beefeater starts for my raised beds as they always do well here. That old tub is older than me belonged to my mother and she was a real homesteader and gardener. The chicken wire is because I free range and the hens think they can take a dust bath in the planters and will peck the fruit. I am also planting sweet corn, squash and watermelon along the old ditch bank by the road in front of my place and see how people driving by react.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you wash clothes off grid?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-27 16:01:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>How do you wash clothes off grid? Since there are several off grid homesteaders on this Reddit I thought this might be useful. I get asked that a lot and I have tried a few ways of washing including the wonderwasher and an old fashioned scrub board, plunger washer and tub and even made my own 55 gallon barrel washer. They all work but leave the clothes very wet and you need a clothes line and not very pleasant to do in winter. Clothes will freeze instead of dry in my area. You can get a hand wringer to squeeze out the water so they dry faster and I remember my mom had a wringer on the washer and was called a mangler for a reason. DO NOT let your kids use one! I inherited a washer and dryer from my mom that I have in that shed next to the cabin and can run off the genny but being a little lazy I usually take my clothes to my girlfriends or drop them at the laundromat while I run errands and because I don't need a lot of clothes I can wash a whole months load and have it dried fast for about $5. Yes, it is not off grid but I am an old single guy and I can live with that. By the way, Thoreau also took his clothes to his mom's and often had dinner at the pubs!

    <TEXT>I just had someone tell me you can't build a "shack" like mine and live off grid in the US because it would be illegal, so let's get the facts straight. Where can you live off grid n the US: 10 best states [https://homesteadsurvivalsite.com/top-10-states-living-off-grid/](https://homesteadsurvivalsite.com/top-10-states-living-off-grid/) Summary: Maine, Texas, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Arizona, Vermont, Missouri, Oregon. and North Carolina have few restriction and building codes in rural areas. Those are not the only states and in fact almost all states have fewer codes the farther you get away from the cities. Because of ground water contamination you may need a septic tank system or approved composting toilet and the Envirolet are approved and used by many off gridders. You may be able to catch rain water or use a stream (get it tested) but it needs to be filtered for potable use other wise you can have water hauled in or hand drill or have a well drilled if the water table is high enough. You should always try to build a safe cabin and there are many plans out there and instruction videos showing proper foundation, framing, sheathing, insulation and roofing and how to install your solar and wind power systems. Most off gridders I know are happy to explain their systems and share that info and encourage people to that lifestyle so be aware of the naysayers trying to tell you it can't be done and will cost more and is illegal as they are likely not even off grid and have no clue what they are talking about.

    <TEXT>Why didn't Thoreau get married and why are many offgridders lone wolves? Some interesting background on Thoreau and he was actually in love with the same gal as his brother and he proposed to her but was turned down. His brother John died of lockjaw (Tetanus) in his arms which is probably some of the reason behind his decision to move to Walden and was dealing with depression, rejection and having a long hard look at his own life and reasons for living.  #160; Thoreau also developed tuberculosis in college and at that time life expectancy from TB was not long so he was aware he may not be around to have a family and chose to not put himself in the situation of dying and leaving a wife and kids without support. I have found over the years that many offgridders are lone wolves (men and women) that choose the lifestyle for that freedom and not everyone wants a permanent relationship. I like my life the way it is right now. I have been married twice and raised my family and have grandkids. Also had live in girlfriends for the last 10 years and it was fun but also a lot of stress I didn't want. Now I have a gal friend that has her own place in town and we get together for adventures but maintain our own places and have our own families. Neither of us want to be married again and need our freedom. "I got rice cookin in the microwave..."

    <TEXT>" lumpytrout said "Why is it that I keep seeing a lack of building codes as being a major attraction for homesteaders? I want tight health restrictions so that my neighbors are not polluting groundwater. If I'm looking at a property I want to know that the barn was built up to code and that the electrical panel passed a basic inspection. I want an area with plentiful and well cared for natural areas, mellow climate, good neighbors and a fantastic growning season. Cheap real estate is cheap for a reason and frequently this means places with terrible quality of land. " You are on [r/OffGrid](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffGrid/) so you should assume most people here are not building conventional code homes. Building codes were developed by insurance companies, the wealthy and land developers to keep people from building an affordable home for themselves. Many people are perfectly capable of building their own home/cabin that is safe and follows good building principles and using systems that have been around for a long time. Including drilling a well, catching rainwater or using a fresh water source (tested and filtered), installing solar and wind power, installing a septic tank or composting toilet and using a heat source like wood stoves or propane. Do you live off grid? I have lived off grid for almost 20 years and built my own cabin. It is very well built and super insulated and built for cash so no house payments and no utility bills and freedom!

    <TITLE>How much does it cost to live off grid comfortably?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-29 15:13:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>How much does it cost to live off grid comfortably? While I was planning to build my off grid cabin and homestead I was also working out on paper how I could support myself and thrive without working for someone else the rest of my life. This led to a long experiment in how much money I actually needed to not just survive but live comfortably which I will share with you here for ideas. I designed and built [my cabin](https://youtu.be/qghZ2ao7GKM) for under $2,000 with a small solar power system and water from an [artesian well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesian_aquifer) and paid for it all with cash so I have no house payment/rent and no monthly utility bills. I do however have property taxes in my state which started out at $28 a year when the land was unused and crept up every year until now I pay about $330 a year. Over 80% of that goes to funding schools even though my kids are all grown and don't live with me. The taxes would be much higher if I owned more land and a bigger cabin and outbuildings. I choose to have a phone and internet though I rarely use the phone. The internet is actually my primary source of income now as I am semi-retired and I use it for researching my projects for off grid living and cabin plans and making youtube videos. That income varies a lot by month but on my worst month I make enough to pay for my phone and internet use which is about $100 and pay for supplies I need. On average I spend about $5 a day for food and I eat well. I cook at home most of the time but I do like a change and will hit a fast food joint or have breakfast at the cafe a few times a month. So I figure $200 a month for food. I grow a garden and raise chickens. I drive about 10 miles to town a few times a week and a tank of gas will last me a month so about $25 a month. Insurance on the truck is $300 a year and registration is $70 because it is old. I use propane for cooking, heating and the OD water heater and in summer one 20 pound tank lasts a month and costs $14. In winter that goes to 1 tank a week for about 4 months so about $340 for the year. I don't spend much on clothes or buy expensive clothes but I need a few new things each year so I figure about $200 for that a year. So my expenses for a year are: $4,840 and I allow for extra expenses and figure $6,000 a year or $500 a month. That is just for me and my basic needs and does not include health insurance as I generally pay for care only as needed. I owned a pest control business and put away money for retirement and to help my kids and so far I haven't had to touch that. I hope that helps people thinking about living off grid to plan for your expenses.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What does "off grid" mean to you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-30 16:20:03</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; [Early pic of my cabin](https://preview.redd.it/k5dqrrlpfx151.jpg?width=455 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=ed1418eb0b9b7afa209866db5b52633ad37c0277) Having been off grid for almost 20 years and starting with nothing and being homeless I have experienced more than a few levels of off grid living from basic survivalist mode in which I had no electrical power to a very small 45 watt system and eventually to my present 400 watt system that meets all my needs for some basic comfort. I actually enjoyed the survivalist mode because I was young and wanted to test myself so figuring out how to survive without electricity and doing work by hand and sweat of my brow was exactly what I needed at that time as I was dealing with depression PTSD and it kept my mind and energy focused. I was developing a very rough and over grown horse pasture to a homestead and I slept in my truck seat and showered outside with plastic bottle water heater warmed by the sun and cooked over a fire pit. Usually fish or cottontail from the local area and ots of potatoes. I would listen to the truck radio while I cut, dug and exerted myself clearing the land and it was great ... while the weather was warm. Then came a small camp trailer and a 45 watt HF system that cost me $400 and an old car battery to power my water pump and a few lights so I could read and design my cabin plans at night. Still very workable and now the neighbors didn't slow down to watch me shower and I didn't run my truck battery down. Because the camper was small I was able to stay warm with some extra blankets and 2 big dogs sleeping on the bed and it was quite comfortable for 1 person. Upgrade three was to a 30 foot RV and a built on shed cabin and a few more panels so I could watch a 12 volt tv I thought I needed and a wood stove for heat. That was a mistake as the RV was very poorly insulated and wood is not easily available or cheap in my area. The shed cabin was used more than the RV and I realized I didn't need that much space and insulation is very important in my area. Then came the 400 sqft cabin I now live in but I learned from my previous experience that I didn't need a large power system so 400 watts of solar and three 125AH AGM batts would be enough for a water pump, LED lights, fans, 12 volt fridge/freezer, laptop computer, and recharging gadgets. A 1500 watt genny for power tools and to run a microwave and washing machine occasionally. Propane OD water heater, stove and small 1500 BTU furnace instead of wood stove. Water is from an artesian free flowing well, septic is my own design solar composting toilet and I have shower, sinks, stove and fridge and my system is set up like a self contained RV with a water tank filled as needed so I can maintain my dry cabin status to satisfy the county codes. This is the balance I found between survivalist system and having a few basic comforts that I could afford on my limited income source and has worked very well for me for many years and I have no plans to make my system larger or more expensive or add more appliances. No house payments and no utility bills and freedom! So what does "off grid" mean to you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Early pic of my cabin](https://preview.redd.it/31ekxtbzix151.jpg?width=455 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=40db37a2fad0227534cffcdc95f09770bbbf9c7a)  #8203; Having been off grid for almost 20 years and starting with nothing and being homeless I have experienced more than a few levels of off grid living from basic survivalist mode in which I had no electrical power to a very small 45 watt system and eventually to my present 400 watt system that meets all my needs for some basic comfort. I actually enjoyed the survivalist mode because I was young and wanted to test myself so figuring out how to survive without electricity and doing work by hand and sweat of my brow was exactly what I needed at that time as I was dealing with depression PTSD and it kept my mind and energy focused. I was developing a very rough and over grown horse pasture to a homestead and I slept in my truck seat and showered outside with plastic bottle water heater warmed by the sun and cooked over a fire pit. Usually fish or cottontail from the local area and ots of potatoes. I would listen to the truck radio while I cut, dug and exerted myself clearing the land and it was great ... while the weather was warm. Then came a small camp trailer and a 45 watt HF system that cost me $400 and an old car battery to power my water pump and a few lights so I could read and design my cabin plans at night. Still very workable and now the neighbors didn't slow down to watch me shower and I didn't run my truck battery down. Because the camper was small I was able to stay warm with some extra blankets and 2 big dogs sleeping on the bed and it was quite comfortable for 1 person. Upgrade three was to a 30 foot RV and a built on shed cabin and a few more panels so I could watch a 12 volt tv I thought I needed and a wood stove for heat. That was a mistake as the RV was very poorly insulated and wood is not easily available or cheap in my area. The shed cabin was used more than the RV and I realized I didn't need that much space and insulation is very important in my area. Then came the 400 sqft cabin I now live in but I learned from my previous experience that I didn't need a large power system so 400 watts of solar and three 125AH AGM batts would be enough for a water pump, LED lights, fans, 12 volt fridge/freezer, laptop computer, and recharging gadgets.

Water is from an artesian free flowing well, septic is my own design solar composting toilet and I have shower, sinks, stove and fridge and my system is set up like a self contained RV with a water tank filled as needed so I can maintain my dry cabin status to satisfy the county codes. I still fish a lot and raise a garden and free range chickens. This is the balance I found between survivalist system and having a few basic comforts that I could afford on my limited income source and has worked very well for me for many years and I have no plans to make my system larger or more expensive or add more appliances. No house payment and no utility bills and freedom! So what does "off grid" mean to you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203; Man I am angry right now! For a week now these 2 ATV keep racing past the cabin with 2 small kids on back of each ATV and a teenager driving and no helmets going like bats out of hell. It finally scared me enough to call the sheriff and tell them about it expecting they would do something. The sheriff did show up and says he talked to them but acted like it was no big deal and I should mind my own business. Each year we have half a dozen kids killed on ATVS and this idiot sheriff wouldn't do anything to stop it and an hour later they went racing past again only this time they at least had helmets on. If anything happens and they get hurt I will report the sheriff for negligence of duty as that is just not right and where the hell are the parents that let their kids do that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Update on the ATV incident Because I had a few people thinking I was being a buttinski neighbor stopping kids having fun let me explain. I was a volunteer EMT for several years and have been on way too many accidents where kids were killed and it is the most heart wrenching and sad thing to see lives lost and especially young lives. Each year we have kids killed on ATVs in my area and everyone says why didn't someone do something. Normally I mind my own business and if this had been a couple of teens with helmets I would probably have not said anything but this was 2 ATVs driven by teens and both carrying very young kids on the back at high speed with no helmets on a black top road that gets all kinds of farm equipment and truck traffic and it has been happening a few times a day for a week. They were also driving without headlights after sunset so they had no visibility. I finally got scared enough for the kids to call the sheriff thinking they would be the best people to talk to the kids and parents and that would be the end of the problem but the deputy had a very negligent and uncaring attitude and did not seem to take it seriously at all. Later that same day the same kids raced past my place twice again at high speeds with no helmets and after sunset so obviously they did not take the officer seriously or he never actually spoke to them. So, I videotaped them this time and I have contacted the local paper, county commissioners office, and sheriff dept. detective to have them follow up with that deputy and to try and bring public attention to this serious and dangerous issue that is not just happening here but happens all over rural America. If people want to think I am over reacting that is fine but at least I won't have to look in the mirror later and say I should have done something after an accident that could have been prevented and young lives lost. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wood Stove Vs. Propane.... or both?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-01 14:27:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Having lived off grid for almost 20 years now I have used both wood stoves and propane so here are my pros and cons of both to help you decide which is best for your situation. First you need to know some terminology: Natural Gas and propane are not the same thing. NG is cleaned gas from methane and is only provided by cities that have natural gas connections to homes. Propane is compressed liquid gas stored in tanks and either delivered to your tank or using refillable tanks the same as used for RV campers. We are talking about propane in this discussion. Propane furnace info here: [https://blog.smarttouchenergy.com/a-guide-to-propane-furnaces](https://blog.smarttouchenergy.com/a-guide-to-propane-furnaces) Not all wood or wood stoves are created equal and how much heat BTU's you get from a type of wood and from the stove varies greatly. That is discussed here: [https://www.wood-heating-solutions.com/wood-species-btu-values/](https://www.wood-heating-solutions.com/wood-species-btu-values/) [https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/choosing-right-wood-burning-stove](https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/choosing-right-wood-burning-stove) Affordability: Wood stoves can be expensive and anywhere from $1,000 for a generic box stove to $10K for a high efficiency model. They may not be allowed in Some states or they can only be installed by a professional and installing a flue and proper safety equipment can be a major modification to a house. Wood stoves require wood and unless you have lots of dead wood on acres of property on your own land you will need a permit to go cut your own wood or have wood delivered and a cord of wood may be $100 in summer and over $200 in winter. You need to consider the cost of a chainsaw, safety equipment and truck if you are cutting your own and gas for both. Propane furnaces are generally available in all states and cost from $200 to $1K depending on BTU heat and features like an optional blower and ventless can be installed by anyone generally, they usually have thermostat control. and built in igniter with a pilot light. You will need to arrange for a tank which may be free from a local propane supplier or use RV style refillable tanks. You may need to pay an installer to run propane lines in to your cabin. In my area wood stoves are not regulated but insurance companies will charge you more for having one. Your local propane dealer can also help install any lines to the house appliances and sell the parts. Propane prices varies by area and fluctuates with the season. Convenience: Wood stoves have to be fed and smaller stoves may have to be filled several times a day in winter. So you need a good steady wood supply and you may be up in the night to refill the stove and there is cutting, splitting and hauling wood that has to be considered especially as you get older. You should never leave a wood stove unattended so leaving your place for any length of time may mean a cold house and frozen pipes. Hauling out ashes and safely disposing of them must be considered and a wood stove should have regular maintenance and cleaning at least once a year. Propane furnaces are fairly hands off and they have a pilot and with a thermostat they only turn on when the temp reaches your setting and turn off as needed. They can be left unattended to maintain heat in a cabin and prevent frozen pipes for short periods and they have a low oxygen shut off in the event the pilot goes out. Getting propane delivery is usually not a problem but refilling RV tanks may be especially on weekend and holidays. Safety: In general the newer wood stoves are safe if installed according to regs but they must have the proper clearance around the stove and floor guard and wall materials and operated correctly. Even with that you will have an occasional flue fire and there is a danger of sparks as you refill a wood stove or escaping from the chimney. You must follow the safety regs and know how to operate a wood stove and it can be a sensitive piece of equipment subject to the whims of the wood and outside temperature. Propane furnaces are considered very safe and have a low oxygen shut off and pilot shut off however propane lines can break and leak and propane is heavier than air and can settle under a house and then explode. It is rare but it does happen. Tanks need the proper valves and furnaces need occasional cleaning and line inspection. Using propane above 5k feet elevation is not recommended. Propane appliances may increase humidity and evaporation causing windows and walls to get wet in some climates. Environment: Older wood stoves are very inefficient and produce a lot of air pollution but the EPA certified wood stoves are much more efficient at burning the wood. That efficiency comes at a cost though and they also tend to not produce fast heat and may require a blower or auger if using pellets. The best EPA wood stoves claim an efficiency of about 75%. People with asthma or allergies may have serous issues with wood stove smoke and particulates in the air. Removing dead wood from your own property or designated cutting area reduces fire hazards and may reduce insect invasions and dangers to trails and homes. Propane furnaces are very efficient and most are rated at 98% efficient and burn so clean they do not require a vent. Propane is a bi-product of oil and gas production and if it is not used for furnaces it wold have to be flared off which is not good for the environment. It is still supporting big oil and is delivered in trucks so there is a cost to the environment from that use. Combination system: Some off gridders choose to use both and a wood stove for heat in winter burning dead wood from your own land in combination with a propane furnace for convenience is a good option to consider. The propane furnace will kick on if the wood stove goes out in the middle of the night and can be used if you need to leave your cabin unattended and you can use propane for a cooking stove instead of a wood stove in summer that heats up your cabin. Summary: I used wood stoves in my first cabin and I enjoyed the heat from a wood stove which is more intense and watching the fire but it was not convenient getting up to refill in the night and wood is not cheap or easily available in my area. Hauling and splitting is a lot of work especially as I got older with bad back and knees. I now use a 1500BTU propane furnace that keeps my 400sqft cabin nice and warm and I can get propane cheap in my area and like that I can leave the cabin and not worry that my pipes will freeze and I come back to a nice warm house. I also have asthma and the wood stove smoke was making that condition a lot worse. I have a small portable wood cook stove with a water tank I keep on hand in case propane becomes unavailable or too expensive that I could install quickly in my cabin and also works well for camping. Video of my woodstove: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bK9vcjoyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bK9vcjoyI) I am sure other people may have different opinions and I welcome your feedback in the comments on your heating systems.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-01 23:21:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Staying cool in your cabin or camper! It finally got hot enough at the cabin to need more than a fan and the doors open so I broke out my Arctic Air personal swamp cooler and filled it up with some ice cold water and now I am very comfortable. This might work for you and it will run off AC or DC USB plug and it is basically a mini swamp cooler and consists of a DC fan and a filter that absorbs water and the fan pushes the air through the soaked filter cooling it down and add a little humidity to my dry high desert climate. It is low power 1amp and less juice than a 12 volt car fan but plenty enough if you put the unit 2-3 feet away and it also comes with some funky flashing lights if you want a light show and also helps to see the level in the water tank. The tank holds about 2 cups of water or a water bottle and if you want it really cold use water stored in your fridge and you can add ice cube or chipped ice. This has 3 speeds and settings for the light show you want to use. This is my second summer using this little hummer and I added a few drops of chlorine to the tank to kill any bacteria and musty smell from sitting all winter and it runs beautifully and now I don't need to run a big window AC unit and my generator. I also use this in my small camper and could even be used in a tent. I think this is a great product and would work well for your cabins, tiny houses or campers or just for a personal space cooler in your office or a bedroom. Now I am cool! I do not sell equipment and you can get one on Amazon or Walmart. #65279;</TEXT>

I show it with a full size bed, kitchen unit and wood stove or you can go with a single bed and desk. No toilet in this design. This is designed to be put up and taken down and moved if needed and can be insulated or uninsulated. Cost estimate is under $300 uninsulated. This would work as a sleeping cabin for people that just need a place to sleep and get out of bad weather and is being designed for a guy that is homeless and wants to move the cabin in in his truck and set up in different locations. Would also work as an off grid cabin, accessory dwelling unit, guest room, spa, office, emergency housing or craft shop. Still some work to do on this one and then I will do the plans and a video walk through.</TEXT>

This is an 8x8 SIPS designed stealth cabin that can be put up and taken down and hauled flat pack in the back of a truck. Specifically designed for emergency/disaster relief shelter or homeless housing but would also work for off grid living or other uses. Can be insulated or uninsulated. This is the single or bunk bed floor plan and I have it shown with a small porch. There is a wet bath, two wardrobes, kitchenette or if you don't want the bathroom you could do a desk or wood stove. Storage space at end be will have drawers and would be a great place to hide your RV water tank and pump.Still lots to do but this will give you some idea of how the space can be used in many different ways and be very livable. This can also have a full bed and bunk bed options to sleep 3. Still a work in progress. I welcome suggestions and happy to answer questions in the comments.</TEXT>

I have been designing and redesigning this cabin for over a week now trying to get the cost under $300 and make it portable for emergency shelter, homeless housing or off grid living.That is about the cost of a decent tent. That is for the cabin framing, sheathing, door, bed platform, skids, and screws. Does not include trimming, shingles or porch. Interior furnishing are just for ideas. This cabin can be insulated. This is 8x8 with 8 feet to the peak and has about 6 feet of head room side to side.It is designed to be built by one person in a day and can then be taken apart easily and transported in a truck as needed. This is designed specifically for orgs and churches that can build these cheap and use them for emergency housing and can be stored and transported flat packed.</TEXT>

These cabins can be used for off grid living, guest house, work shop, sauna, office, shop, and many other uses and can be modified to suit your needs. I include complete step by step plans, ideas for trim and interior, recommended equipment, material list and even a small solar set up information.

    <TEXT>Well, the Stealth cabin and Shepherd wagon plans were downloaded over 1200 times today so I call that a success. Hopefully they will reach the people that need affordable shelter and the people that can build those shelters. Had several people contact me to thank me personally for the plans. Now I am going to focus on some of my own homestead projects and maybe something or someone will inspire a new project. Thanks to all for the feedback and putting up with the delays.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Time to finish my hot tub mud room!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-28 07:43:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started this project last year but got sidetracked and now that I have a little extra money I can get the OD water heater and materials I need to finish it. This is a 4x8 addition off the back door of my cabin and I am using a Rubbermaid cattle trough for the tub because it is deeper and shorter than a standard tub. It will be heated with an OD propane water heater and I like the Eccotemp L5 that I have used for over 10 years in my cabin bathroom but they are sold out so I ordered this one which looks very similar: [https://amzn.to/3dD83MT ](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3dD83MT amp;event=backstage_event amp;redir_token=ThUWK7Hjl7O9xYN7sEMO0cKZAa98MTU5MzQxNjQ2N0AxNTkzMzMwMDY3) For $85 that is a good deal so I hope it is as good as the L5. I have my siding ready to go up and just need a few studs and an OSB panel to finish the roof and some scrounged materials for the inside to fancy it up. I am also looking at a small washer and spin dryer like this one: [https://amzn.to/3dGh8F1 ](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3dGh8F1 amp;event=backstage_event amp;redir_token=ThUWK7Hjl7O9xYN7sEMO0cKZAa98MTU5MzQxNjQ2N0AxNTkzMzMwMDY3)  #8203; I usually take my clothes to the laundromat once a month but since I am running water to that mud room and have the space I could put that in there and run it off the genny for a half hour to do clothes at home if needed. I also ordered some rechargeable puck lights, a solar light, for that room and some other off grid stuff so when it gets here I will make a video of that hot tub and wash room. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New to this Reddit but a long time off grid homesteader</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-28 14:13:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thanks for letting me join! I am new to this Reddit but a long time off grid homesteader on land that belonged to my grandparents under the Homestead Act. I have been off grid for almost 20 years in a solar cabin I built myself and I garden, raise chickens and dogs and build and share off grid project ideas. Semi-retired now and kids all grown with grand-kids so I write books and make vids about off grid homesteading and design off grid and survival cabins for other people. I am an architectural draftsman and in my younger days I designed and built many sheds and cabins for people. Currently I just finished designing stealth cabin and Shepherd wagon plans for orgs that build housing for homeless Vets and disaster relief. I am working on finishing my hot tub and mud room off the back of my cabin and getting materials for that and doing some landscaping on my homestead to make it a Japanese/cottage garden. Always happy to help with solar power, off grid living and cabin design questions and I will share my projects and adventures in homesteading.</TEXT>

Raised the wall on the single to 9 feet so porch had more head room. Anything else needed on the outside or ideas for the houses?</TEXT>

They are more efficient at holding in the the heat or maintaining the cool air because they are better insulated, have higher thermal mass and are tightly sealed to prevent wind, draft and moisture penetration.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2x6 walls vs. 2x4 walls and Extreme Weather Construction</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-04 23:03:37</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203;  #8203; [Traditional 2x4 wall on 16 inch centers](https://preview.redd.it/pafzb8w15x851.png?width=691 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=3b44eee7d1b25d9a7f0a689672c97230bb861027)  #8203; [2x6 wall on 2' centers](https://preview.redd.it/cvj0hvcc5x851.png?width=740 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=90a91a81139ee4f5f6318539e3e867ad44215ab6) I posted a new design for an extreme weather 12x16 cabin using 2x6 structural framing and there was some confusion/questions about why 2x6 construction is superior so I thought this visual might help new builders. The top pic shows a traditional 8x16 wall with 2x4 wall framing on 16 inch centers. This is the type of wall in many existing homes and is still a common construction method The cost for the additional framing on 16 in centers and for additional R13 insulation for that wall will cost $243.99 at Lowes USA. The second pic is an 8x16 wall with 2x6 wall framing on 2' centers. It uses less framing but has superior strength and more space for insulation and higher R value. It can be used for R19 or R24 insulation and that wall will cost $193.85 with R19 insulation at Lowes USA. For zones 3-1 R24 is recommended. There are other cost savings as it takes less nails/screws and less time to build the 2x6 wall and it has less thermal bridging for even better insulation value. Thermal bridging is when cold penetrates through the framing and the more framing the more thermal bridging. Note: You will also notice the corner framing in the 2x6 uses a California or L corner which allows insulation to be placed all the way in to the corner and creates a lip for attaching interior wall coverings which reduces cold corners from bridging and makes attaching dry wall much easier.  #8203; Summary: So you can see that using 2x6 framing provides superior strength, superior insulation value, is faster to build and cheaper than a traditional 2x4 wall and is recommended for all extreme climate construction. 2x4 walls on 2' centers are common interior walls with sound barrier or no insulation. The savings from using 2x6 insulated and R19 is about 10% of average heating/cooling costs and 15% for R24 insulation depending on region.

Now you may think that is silly for an old guy to float around in a pool that size but when you reach a certain IDGAF stage in life you don't care and my neighbors all know I am eccentric. The pool is just 8x3 but enough to float around in and do some water exercising and I rarely use that filter pump. Just a smimmer net and a little chlorine to kill any bacteria. I empty about half the water and refill every few weeks so it stays fresh. I will put my lounge chairs and bench around it and maybe some potted palms for that beach effect and I have a pirate's flag. Anyway, that is my off grid project for the day and it should be full in a few hours and ready for dipping.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's does prepping mean to you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-06 00:00:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>About 20 years ago I had my survival skills really put to the test and after a sudden illness and divorce I found myself broke and homeless. I was lucky enough to have an old truck and a small piece of rough land I inherited from my Grandad's place. I parked that old truck on my land and slept and lived in that until I found a part time job and then I worked hard every day clearing all the sage brush and crap left from other people. I had a few tools and borrowed what I didn't have and scrounged dumpsters and bartered work for materials and rabbits and fish were my regular diet for a long time. I saved enough to buy a small camper and lived in that for a year while I designed my off grid cabin I live in today. People every day become homeless for many reasons and find themselves without shelter, food, money and no one to care or help. Many of them are Vets that served the country and have all the training most of you wish you had but still they struggle to make it from one day to the next. I have been a self sufficient person my whole life and grew up on a homestead where raising animals, gardening, hunting, fishing and camping were just regular activities and still are and I can do all that in my neck of the woods anytime being surrounded by thousands of acres of BLM land. Prepping to me is about having the skills to start over again and survive in bad times and thrive in good times regardless of what life throws at you. It is about knowing your capabilities and having the ingenuity and creativity to find solutions where other people would struggle and fail. Today I am in a good position in life and I am semi-retired with enough money to last out my life and can even help my kids and grandkids but I have not forgot what those homeless days were like and the anxiety you feel. So I try to help homeless Vets and other people to build their own sustainable homesteads and cabins and live a simple sustainable life by sharing my experiences and what I learned. I am not prepping for any apocalypse because I already lived through mine. So what does prepping mean to you and what are you prepping for?</TEXT>

I have an old 5x8 trailer with side walls and I have extra solar panels, water tank and that OD water heater coming today. I have a small wood stove for cooking and a cot mattress for a bed so all I need is to build the structure. Then I can tow that to some local fishing spots and share those off grid adventures. I really like the Shepherd Wagon design and would not cost more than $300 to build and could build it in a couple of weeks I think. Would that be something people would be interested in watching? #65279; Update: I got materials to build! I get excited when I have something to build so I went and got 7 sheets of plywood and enough 2x4s to get started on the Shepherd Wagon build. This is an authentic Shepherder Wagon built in the 50's and used for many years. Mine will be similar but on a lighter duty trailer that was used to haul snowmobiles. I wanted to get inside pics of that wagon but the homeowners were not home and this big Rotty was not pleased I was on the property so maybe in the future. #65279;</TEXT>

Now you have to have a half dressed pretty woman in your off grid videos to get views I guess. They are snazzy vids for sure but some are misleading and not very credible. It makes me worry that people will go trying to live off grid expecting it all to be sunshine and roses and run head first in to reality. Oh well, I will just make my Shepherd wagon vids and tell you about simple off grid living and hope there are still people interested in that lifestyle. I need to run to town and get a water diverter for that OD water heater and screws for the wagon build and tomorrow I start building the wagon. #65279; Anyway, I got that Gasland OD water heater mounted to the hot tub mud room wall and noticed it is a different model than what I ordered. This one has 3 adjustment knobs and an LED thermostat. It has a winter or summer use setting so it can use less burners and save propane in summer. I haven't tried it out yet because last thing I want is a hot bath right now but it looks to be well made and I will give it a trial run soon. I have a bathroom vent fan that will go above it to exhaust any CM same as in the cabin. #65279; These should be mounted outside according to their warnings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Shower works](https://preview.redd.it/n3xbvflepaa51.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=ee01519c91dae2901f957c0b9e9e24f25da321fa) Man that felt good! I hooked up the water to the OD water heater in the hot tub mudroom but I forgot I needed D cell batts for the ignitor so I just ran cold water through it to rinse out the gunk and the water felt so nice and just the right temp for a cold shower. so I got in and just let that shower cool me off. I have a shower in the cabin but because it is connected to my 35 gallon RV tank I try to limit showers to 10 minutes so I don't have to refill that tank and use the water pump. This mudroom shower is connected directly to my well water line and can run 24/7 continually so hot or cold showers any time for as long as I want now and a hot tub soak when it is cold outside. Well has plenty of pressure for the shower so no pump needed. I just have to get D cells and a floor drain for that tub because the side drain doesn't drain all the water and I need a couple of bolts for that trailer and then I am set. I am happy again! #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Over a hundred for a week now and I just can not work outside when it is that hot as it kicks in my CFS and I end up sick. So I get a couple of hours in early morn and evening. That cold shower in the mudroom is sure coming in handy and water temp from the well is perfect for cooling off without getting too cold. I have the floor drain for the tub but I need a 1.5 inch hole saw. I found a kit of different sizes on Amazon so have to wait for that to put in the drain and I need the drain before I can work on the bathtub surround. So it goes... #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203; [Shepherd Wagon floor framed](https://preview.redd.it/gmixyvgikua51.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=ca2a2d906dfb88fa4ca75ebec1befeaf9ac4321a) I got the floor framed and stubs in. If you are wondering why I placed those cross stubs at those places it is because that is where most of the weight in the wagon will be from me going in and out and a wood stove and cabinets. There won't be much weight under the bed portion or any traffic. I am using 3 inch screws instead of nails because the lumber we get here is pretty warped and hard as a rock and screws will pull the warp out of a board and won't split as much in a rock hard 2x4. This reminded me of my son when he was about 5 and I was building a porch off a house and he wanted to help so I started a couple of nails for him and let him bang on them with the hammer. I got busy cutting some lumber and came back to find he had those nails pounded in and had put in several more on his own. Not in the right places but he did it! That is all I will get done until this evening and time for a cold shower, lunch and a nap. #65279;</TEXT>

Comes with about 7 feet of good pipe. Not that crappy aluminum stuff. Has a damper, door latch and door seal. Just right for a tiny house or my Shepherd wagon or emergency back up heat. Firebox is 11"w. x 17"d. x 8"h so it will hold a couple of 3-4 inch logs and last about 5 hours I think. Has a nice flat cook top surface and comes with the clean out accessories. Only thing you will need is a 3/16 hex wrench to put it together and it went together fast. I will do the initial burn off and include this in my next Shepherd Wagon video. All that lumber lifting and bending over I managed to throw my back out and leaning over to put the wood stove together it locked up on me so I may be down for a few days. That is OK and I have some other stuff I can work on. Here is that wood stove if you are looking for one: https://amzn.to/3fzaD8A</TEXT>

These work great on a wood stove or gas range for cooking pizza, baking flat bread/scones or just warming up anything and this kit comes with two 8 inch stones and stainless steel dome covers so one is for the wood stove to take camping and the other will be used in the cabin on the gas range. Good deal for $20.

I will be parking the Wagon next to the cabin so I can always cook a meal out there on the wood stove so I don't heat up the cabin and I save on propane. I have a huge pile of Russian olive branches I need to get rid of so that will now become firewood and those are small limbs perfect to fit that stove. #65279; I am set to cook! ## Of all the grub that #8217;s put out for men to eat,And all that includes apple pie to rare red meat,The cook who wins the prize is the one who #8217;s in the know,And at breakfast, dinner, and supper, feeds them sourdough. ## He #8217;s hunted the hills since daylight for gold,It #8217;s bent his back and made him old,But he comes in at night, his face all aglow,A-knowin #8217; he #8217;s gonna get beans and sourdough. ## From  #8220;The Complete Sourdough Cookbook #8221;by Don Holm</TEXT>

These are from the mortgage Lifter heritage plants and the vines look almost dead from the heat so I picked them early and will ripen them in a paper bag. I am just happy to get anything off the garden this year</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I got the first part of the Japanese soaking tub installation vid made before I had to lay down again as my back started to sing. I think you will like this vid and it is really dirty and may even be illegal! I need to cut some holes and do some installing after lunch and try to get this video up by tomorrow. #65279; UPDATE: Japanese soaking tub floor drain is in and OD water heated vented and the tub is filling now! Everything went pretty smooth and I have the video done and just need to do a little editing. I think you will like it and I put some humor in this one. Now I get to enjoy the fruits of my labor and take a long hot soak for my back and I sure need it. Hope you are all having a great weekend! #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use both in my off grid cabin and to take Overlanding and they are great for showering, washing dishes and even hot enough for a cup of coffee. They are portable and 3 gallon propane tank will probably last you through summer. This is my install at the cabin of the Gasland for my Japanese soaking tub and it is a little more expensive but also has a built in LED temp reading and is very well made. The Eccotemp L5 are less expensive but handle the job and both are low flow systems. Get them on Amazon.

This has 2x8 flooring and 2x6 or 2x8 roof and walls for R24 insulation and a steep slope to keep snow and rain off. Shown with stairs to a loft bedroom, large bathroom with garden tub, vanity and standard throne, Behind the stairs is a small room for storage , pantry, office or a nursery. Large kitchen with good storage. Pull out couch bed and the bathroom could be a bedroom. Loft bedroom is aprox. 8x8. I will include a porch and rear addition in the plans. This cabin can be modified many ways to suit your needs. I have not done a material list yet but estimate around $4K dried in and depends on foundation and materials used. It is designed specifically for off grid living but could be connected to utilities. I include info for off grid systems I recommend and extreme weather construction specifics in the plans. I will announce when the plans are ready for anyone interested. Click on the pics to zoom in and see the detail work.</TEXT>

I needed something high enough I could work on the wagon from a chair since my back is acting up and that old bench and chairs will work great. Now I can get the floor sheathed and that will give me a platform for cutting the walls and framing for the rest of the project. I will do everything except the roofing and then paint it all with a power painter and slide it in the trailer to do the roofing. Update: I got the floor sheathed but my back is so wobbly and weak that just getting a little off balance and down I go. So this will take some time to be safe. Starting to get hot so I will do some more this evening. #65279;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-20 22:20:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I went to get the mail and noticed I had overflow water in my front ditch so I let Taz play in the water and wandered along the ditch to watch. When I planted my raised beds earlier this year I had some extra sweet corn starts so I stuck them in the ditch and figured they probably wouldn't make it but they are growing and I noticed that some lily bulbs I planted 5 years ago finally sprouted and are starting new clumps in the ditch. Once the lilies get established they spread pretty fast so in a few more years I should have a nice flowery ditch bank. I need to keep adding plants and bulbs and just let them multiply naturally. Maybe put in some gourd plants for color? #65279; That ditchbank has been an ongoing project since I moved here. No pics to show as it is just green on green but if the corn produces ears I will get some pics.</TEXT>

After doing some research I found grapes are hardy in my area and surprised no one is really growing them. So got some Himrod grape plants and started them in big tubs to see how they would do and they are thriving here. My next step is to do one row along the front of my property with wire trellis like the vineyards use and and then add more rows each year. I plan to plant strawberries between the grape vines and maybe other plants like mater and put in drip irrigation from my 1100 gallon tank. I went looking for info on trellises and pruning and found this video from a professional vineyard if anyone is interested in a grapery for your own homesteads.

Sweep and then mop to wash away their pheromone trail. Clean the stove hood and counters. Wash up all dishes and look for any drippy containers. That usually gets rid of them without pesticides but I got some permethrin to give the cabin a treatment and also works well to deter spiders.

It appears he built this on a Harbor Freight 4x8 trailer with no sides which I would be afraid is a bit wobbly and I am using a much heavier duty trailer with side panels.

This has 2x8 flooring and 2x6 or 2x8 roof and walls for R24 insulation and a steep slope to keep snow and rain off. Shown with stairs to a loft bedroom, large bathroom with garden tub, vanity and standard throne, Behind the stairs is a small room for storage , pantry, office or a nursery. Large kitchen with good storage. Pull out couch bed and the bathroom could be a bedroom. Loft bedroom is aprox. 8x8. I will include a porch and rear addition in the plans. This cabin can be modified many ways to suit your needs. I have not done a material list yet but estimate around $4K dried in and depends on foundation and materials used. It is designed specifically for off grid living but could be connected to utilities. I include info for off grid systems I recommend and extreme weather construction specifics in the plans. I will announce when the plans are ready for anyone interested. This A Frame is designed to meet approved standards for extreme weather insulation here: Recommended reading: Next Generation high performance Walls [https://www.homeinnovation.com/\~/media/Files/Reports/Construction-Guide-to-Next-Generation-High-Performance-Walls-in-Climate-Zones-3-5-Part-1-2x6-Walls.pdf](https://www.homeinnovation.com/~/media/Files/Reports/Construction-Guide-to-Next-Generation-High-Performance-Walls-in-Climate-Zones-3-5-Part-1-2x6-Walls.pdf) High-R Wall-02: 2x6 Advanced Frame Wall Construction Building Science Corporation [https://www.buildingscience.com/documents/enclosures-that-work/high-r-value-wall-assemblies/copy\_of\_advanced-frame-wall-construction](https://www.buildingscience.com/documents/enclosures-that-work/high-r-value-wall-assemblies/copy_of_advanced-frame-wall-construction) These Extreme Weather Cabins are designed with superior insulation and less frame bridging so more insulation in walls and thermal mass is increased through use of other materials in the design. They are more efficient at holding in the the heat or maintaining the cool air because they are better insulated, have higher thermal mass and are tightly sealed to prevent wind, draft and moisture penetration.

They even have matching paint jobs and I have saddle bags and a smaller fold-able trailer for the mini so I can haul gear and the dog. Go pro camera mount for both to capture the adventure. I am also building a Shepherd Wagon Vardo on a 5x8 trailer to tow behind it that will be outfitted with a Guide Gear wood stove, solar shower and panels to power my laptop and recharge gadgets. The minibike will fit inside the Wagon.

These come with two 8 inch stones and 2 dome lids with handles so I will use one in the cabin and one in the wagon. They have ridges on the bottom so they won't scorch the food and covers go completely over the stone and act like a mini-oven.

I didn't have any liquid nails so I have to get that before I attach them to the floor framing so that will be in the next video with the side walls and some framing. Everything went smooth and I rested a lot between work. My back is feeling a little better each day and that Aleve helped.

    <TEXT>It is also about the time I should be finished with the Shepherd Wagon, Hot Tub mudroom and the Extreme weather cabin and off grid living book I am working on and the design contest will end. So I think I will do an anniversary video special and recap my off grid adventures and mishaps over those years and my retirement projects and then ride off in to the sunset and turn over the off grid video portion to the younger folk. Many of them were my followers before off gridding was cool. I will still do vids but I think I will focus on more exploring and outdoor adventure vids from the comfort of the wagon as I enjoy what time I have left to still be able to do those things. Hopefully take a trip up the West coast to visit my son and his wife and grandson and see some of the country I haven't visited. Yep, I think that is the plan! #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need lights for your off grid projects?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 12:15:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I needed some rechargeable lights for my new mudroom and Shepherd Wagon and I didn't want to run wiring so I got a couple of different lights to try out. At first I wasn't very impressed with the light output of the puck lights but I have found them very useful. They have a motion sensor or full time on switch and that motion sensor is nice. I have one in my bathroom and mudroom so now when I walk in the light comes on so no fumbling for a switch and it is like a warm welcome to come in and sit a spell. The bulb light has a nice diffuser and puts out good light for small spaces and about the same light as a 15 watt bulb. Well made with a good switch and hanger and can even be used as a flashlight. The solar panel is not the best but should be fine for camping and it can be recharged from USB. Light stays good for about 5 hours straight. They come with a USB recharge cord that also fits this globe LED light that throws off better light and will be used in the mudroom and wagon and the cord is interchangeable so I use it to recharge both or from the small solar panel that comes with the globe light. Nice features and good inexpensive lights for your off grid projects. This is the puck light and comes with 2: [https://amzn.to/3htJ6WP ](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3htJ6WP amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTFUNThPS1pfWHdSTTkyRjJBOUZiRFRQalZyUXxBQ3Jtc0trT1NzMkV5YW1ocUZkcGNiVzdFWUZvbjJNSnRxbGUtWi1WRFd0OFR4bmpHdDJUX25yTHQxdHNZTkJCb3VGX3ZONE1LRkxzaW9vaklzblNkRXdUa1k1b1d4eFl5TmJOdEJmVjlhZjlHLTFTRzdUMEV2TQ%3D%3D amp;event=backstage_event) This is the globe light and comes with a solar panel: [https://amzn.to/3jyaMvA #65279;](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3jyaMvA amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1RqSzJGckM4a210M2lmZkRHcVpEV0FMSjlsd3xBQ3Jtc0tsYkNBc0dzRF9tMEVDZXdqSjVrUTFWdHB2YkZzalNRYWwyTzRxRmFtZ2t4ZUpqZVRyZWZnSl8wSzl5Smt4VXVKZmFORnY3bVUzdUNjd24xUEtzMGExWWl5LWo4dlRvc2RZRW9PUHFndXcwNGM2U2U3VQ%3D%3D amp;event=backstage_event)</TEXT>

Well I haven't weeded it because I saw some unusual sprouts starting and thought maybe those would be wild flowers and this week some of them started to bloom and I have white blooming wild flowers in the bed and more varieties look to be coming in. So I will leave the bed alone and if they thrive I will transplant some out to that front ditchbank I have been trying to spruce up. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks to be a bleary drizzly day here. I am hoping to get the end and side walls all done on the Wagon this weekend so I can show that next week and then paint it and do the roofing in another video. I need to find some bathboard and get a couple of rolls of insulation for the mudroom and do the shed roof. So looks like I will make a run to the local builder supply and see what they have today. I have tar paper and shingles that match the cabin. I want to get that sealed up before the heavy rains hit in the fall. OK, that is my weekend plans if the weather cooperates and hope you are all finding ways to stay busy and happy on your homesteads! #65279; If you missed any of the Shepherd Wagon build series: PART 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uwKfiGY1mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uwKfiGY1mo) PART 2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujhrskLcDdE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujhrskLcDdE) Part 3: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjF0ETVcIEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjF0ETVcIEs) Hot Tub Mudroom build series: Part 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0FeqfuCY7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0FeqfuCY7w) Part 2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htXN7yoaXqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htXN7yoaXqM) Part 3: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYticG09Kp8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYticG09Kp8) Free plans: [https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/microcabinplans.htm](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments amp;stzid=UgxA5gt4uWx5PZlbaZN4AaABAg amp;html_redirect=1 amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0oxTnlEZTVzRmw1Vll4djdhMGpZNlpLOHN1QXxBQ3Jtc0tuRkhkUGc0SElKUVZ4OVNwbUZCVzRkNjJXT0ttVjhlaU1QMHFDTC1FZmxLYTJGeV91TlR0eTBGNXMxVHZHUnVYUzdCTDVtQkcxdk1JNUpoaDBuZ0t3TGlndHNEaXFWSi1TcFRQOVBKdnhNT1dXaWxqQQ%3D%3D amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplesolarhomesteading.com%2Fmicrocabinplans.htm) Please like, subscribe and share and unblock the ads and help an old offgridder out!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-23 22:33:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was in a Reddit forum today and noticed a new member posting that they were starting a youtube offgrid channel and asking people to subscribe. Not unusual at all but I started reading the comments and the guy was telling someone that asked how he got so many subs so fast that he had 6 YT accounts and was using them to subscribe to his own channel. This has become common on YT and people also pay for subs and likes and pay google to promote their vids. The days when a creator had to earn their subs and likes honestly with substance and credibility are over and now it has been taken over by greed and quick snazzy creators trying to make a fast buck. That is one of the reasons I am probably retiring from doing off grid project vids as I feel Google has catered to this activity and has created a bad environment. I will finish up these projects to share and then move to doing adventure and exploration vids as I just don't want to compete with dishonest people. #65279;</TEXT>

Addition is optional and there is plenty of room for 2 people in the A Frame without the addition. Click on the pics to zoom in and see the detail work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got confirmation that a 100 watt panel w/controller and 12 volt fridge/freezer are sent and will be available for grand prizes for the contest. I will do a vid review of both in return and then repackage like new. Because I have to send these myself and shipping is expensive these will be for US prizes only. Most submissions are from US so shouldn't be a problem. Other prizes like books and ebooks can be sent anywhere. So get working on your designs folks and you can submit them next month. Lloyd Kahn from [www.shelterpub.com](http://www.shelterpub.com), Alex Pino from www.tinyhousetalk.com and I will be judging and I hope we see a lot of variety in designs and some real creativity. You can see the contest rules and download a free copy of Sketchup 8 here: [https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/housesthatmovecontest.htm](https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/housesthatmovecontest.htm)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Adventure Rigs: Jeep, Mini-bike and Shepherd Wagon Vardo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 11:55:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>[My Adventure Rigs: Jeep and Mini-bike](https://preview.redd.it/bvbt1zbjnsc51.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=0a34eed46cf0d4b7078e6264d9d9a91830ce886a) I do a lot of back country exploring so the Jeep gets me in to places a bigger rig can't go and then the off road minibike can get even deeper in to the boonies to find that special fishing hole. They even have matching paint jobs and I have saddle bags and a smaller fold-able trailer for the mini so I can haul gear and the dog. Go pro camera mount for both to capture the adventure. I am also building a Shepherd Wagon Vardo on a 5x8 trailer to tow behind it that will be outfitted with a Guide Gear wood stove, solar shower and panels to power my laptop and recharge gadgets. The minibike will fit inside the Wagon so it is also my toy hauler. You can get the free plans for the Shepherd Wagon and follow my progress here: PART 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uwKfiGY1mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uwKfiGY1mo) PART 2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujhrskLcDdE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujhrskLcDdE) Part 3: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjF0ETVcIEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjF0ETVcIEs)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Switching my files over to Google Drive. I have used Dropbox for a few years but they keep changing the system trying to force users to upgrade to have direct downloads. So I am switching all my files over to Google Drive this weekend. If you recently ordered an ebook and link does not seem to work contact me and I will send you a new link. I have lots of files to transfer so it will take some time to get them all transferred over. Thanks! #65279;</TEXT>

The racks are for keeping food warm or drying socks and glove etc. That is the little Japanese tea pot and Caldera (cauldron) mini Dutch oven. Just right for one and small stove cooking. I will try ti do the first burn off this weekend and show the stove in use. #65279;</TEXT>

The floor is braced and glued and also metal L brackets on corners so it is super strong for traveling on bouncy old roads. I should have both side walls done today and will post more pics.</TEXT>

I planned on a taller door but this will work and just adds to the uniqueness of the Wagon. I don't mind ducking a little to get inside.I am still debating whether to make it a Dutch door but I can decide that later. That free door saved me a lot of time trying to build a door, buy glass and get the hardware. It has the hinges so I will just need an old fashioned door handle and plug the old door knob hole. It is going to look good!</TEXT>

I remember helping my dad install a door and he taught me to always leave a space so the door can swing smoothly by using a nickle as a spacer on all sides. Most doors these days come pre-hung in a frame but I will be hanging this door the old fashioned way. Door plugged and sanded. The arch is attached with long screws and construction adhesive and I sanded the top smooth. The old door hole is plugged and I used my trusty door hole saw and cut a plug from the scrap cut off the door to fit the hole and filled in the gaps with construction adhesive. You can barely see it on the upper right and that excess will be cut off when the adhesive dries and sanded smooth. Sprinkling a little here but I don't mind if it stays cooler. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIL: Vinegar gets paint off glass!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-27 22:02:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I learned something new and valuable today! I am in the process of building a Shepherd Wagon vardo and the old door I am using had a lot of old spray paint stuck to the glass. In the past I would grab a rag and a little gas but that is stinky and dangerous. So I went online and they recommended white vinegar. I thought it was maybe an old wives tale. I didn't have any white vinegar but I had an old bottle of apple cider vinegar so I gave it a try. That paint came right off with a little scrubbing from a scotch bright pad so I tried it on the scuff marks on the door frame and it took all the old black marks off. Door paint is still good and just needed a good cleaning. I remember Mom used vinegar a lot for cleaning. #65279; Note: Reposted because I have a troll stalking all my posts</TEXT>

They don't keep it with the fancy brand name paint. He told me this stuff would cover in one coat and no drip or splatter and he was right. Much better paint consistency and cover and was $10 cheaper than the cheapest brand name paint. I sent him a copy of the plans to his email and now I know what to get for other projects. Still have almost 3/4ths of the can and will use some for my dry sink and the bed rails and a few things and then save it for touchups. #65279;</TEXT>

I got it on Amazon for a few bucks and will go perfect with the tiny Wood Guide woodstove: [https://amzn.to/3hTIOss #65279;](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkN2M2R2cnh1cjctZ0ljaXVrZHhwMVZTSUhLQXxBQ3Jtc0trekVkcXlsU3NIVmtMcTdCSzQ5RmNsbkFwRm5qcUpQbWNYNGNNUzBaTDU2RXZETUd0ODQydFcxRHpDN2g2SjV5cFFFOVFDOWJFVzIwa1dFVEpYYXlaY09rMTdkMmF6UkhHajFUeWNLU01KaE9oVHNiWQ%3D%3D amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3hTIOss amp;event=backstage_event)</TEXT>

You could use a twin platform or even a full size bed in the wagon if you are not using the wood stove. I placed my platform right on the side overhangs which is perfect to allow me to sit on the edge of the bed to drink my coffee in the morning and contemplate my days adventures and can be used as a couch if I have visitors. You can raise it up higher if you want a traditional vardo bed with more storage and a table underneath. I am an old guy and don't want my feet dangling off the side of the bed. The platform framing is 2x3s and is glued and screwed to the side wall and end wall framing and ties the entire structure together making it extremely stable. Tomorrow I finish a little painting and put in the rafters and then get my bro to help slide it in the trailer for the roofing to be done.</TEXT>

The first one appears to be the same as my 14x14 design and they show it with a full glass front. Which would be really stupid as it would overheat the place and be a security nightmare. Anyway, that showed up in my email this morning and thought I would share it with you and funny how people start promoting the same cabins and plans I have been posting to show people how they are constructed. Not the first time and there was another company that tried selling plans of my 14x14 solarcabin when it got very popular. By the way you can get the 14x14 A Frame plans for $5 on my website and that cabin has been built by several people with real pics of their A Frame cabins and 16x16 plans will be available around October or sooner. http://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/aframecabinplans.htm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I need a trailer jack with a wheel to load and unload the wagon so I have that coming and I found a window for the back wall of the wagon. It is not wood but is white and has a sliding sash and muntins so it will match the door. Those are the last 2 things I needed to finish this project and will be here next week. I am also officially changing the name of my Wagon design from Shepherd Wagon to Campin' Wagon because I don't herd sheep and that name seems to put people off, lol!</TEXT>

My $2000 off grid hand built cabin is valued at $49K according to the county. My how it increased in value when they need more tax revenue. What I find really ironic is the county wouldn't let me connect to the grid power in my camper even though there was a pole on the property which started me on my off grid adventures but now they value my cabin at 25X more than I built it for.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-03 10:01:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK, every year I get a mouse trying to live in the cabin and the stinker chews through my bread and cereal sacks and spoils the food. My cabin is well sealed but I leave the doors open in summer so they probably just walk right in, so it is my own fault. Anyway, I had one in the cabin the last few days and found my bread sack chewed through so I moved the bread and used a good old fashioned snap trap baited with that bread and the mouse met his maker this morning. I don't like killing little creatures but I don't want spoiled food and mouse filth and I won't use mouse baits like decon around my place because of Tazzy dog so the snap traps are a humane option. Cats are not an option because of allergies. I remember my mom had a metal breadbox to keep bread in so maybe I need to find one of those since that is the only food that is in a package the mice can easily chew through. If they don't find a food source they would probably leave on their own. #65279;</TEXT>

I had another one but the sound was crappy and batt life was only a few hours. This new one will play the radio over 8 hours and I keep it hooked to my USB plug so it is always charged and running off my own power system and uses micro-amps so no real drain at all and ready for camping when needed. The old one wouldn't play the radio when it was charging. Everyone should have an emergency radio with weather band and to get local news reports IMO.

Mine is a pirate flag and came with the pole. The trailer is an Aosom trailer and I got that and the flag on Amazon. Tazzy dog in the trailer and it can haul 88 pounds and works great for the dog and my fishing/camping gear. Tazzy is in the trailer laying down after a long hard ride and run in the dunes and she absolutely loves to go riding. I wouldn't go without my adventure dog!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Completely Off Grid/Survival Systems and ideas for sustainable homesteading</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 10:56:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>After 20 years living off grid starting in survival mode with just a truck and a few tools to now living in a small hand built cabin with solar power I have learned by trial and error what systems a person needs for survival and comfort and maybe this will help some people considering this lifestyle. Water: You must have water to survive and to take care of a garden and animals. That water source must be clean and fresh. It can be a river, stream, well, rain collection or delivered and you need a way to store enough for your homestead and personal use. Small barrels, tanks or a large tank and use a sterilizer like chlorine and a filter like the Berkey filters to remove contaminants and kill bacteria. Many old homesteaders died and lost family due to unclean water. Shelter: A permanent cabin, mobile shelter or tent Your shelter needs to protect your from the weather and depends on where you are homesteading. In general it needs to be sealed from water, wind, cold and heat penetration. New materials are expensive but old timers used tar paper (roofing felt) which is cheap and will keep out moisture, wind and allows the structure to breath and that would enclose the structure used over what ever materials the structure is made. A house is only as good as the roof it is under and roofs must be sealed from moisture, pitched for rain/snow run off and solidly attached. Windows and doors are expensive but with a little creative scrounging you can find them free/cheap that are salvage. Rough sawn planks, logs and timbers are usually available from a local mill or mill your own. Green wood should not be used until it has seasoned/dried for a year or use kiln dried lumber. Keep your base cabins small and under 200 sqft is a good starter size cabin that can be built on with additions later and that is the size many counties in the US allow without a permit (check codes). Foundation can be permanent on footings or piers or free standing on local rock or cement block. It should be at least 8 inches off the ground to prevent termites and skirted and sealed to stop drafts under the floor. Basic framing info is available online or at the library. Insulation is not required in very moderate climates but is recommended and will greatly reduce the amount of heat and cooling you will need. Batt or foam board insulation works well or some of the green insulation, straw bale and rammed earth will work but requires more experience to install. If you insulate and seal the structure you will be more comfortable and reduce energy loss regardless of what other materials you are using. Insulation more than pays for itself. If you are setting up a temp structure like a tent it should be designed for all seasons in your location and most "camping" tents are not designed for anything but recreational use. A good canvas outfitter tent will work and has enough room for living space. Commercial yurts are expensive and not suitable for most climates and difficult to construct. Campers/RVs can work in some climates but are generally not well insulated and prone to leaks, heating and cooling issues. Heating and cooling: In very moderate climates you can rely on the sun for heat but most places you will need a heat source and small wood stoves designed for cabins can be used for that and for cooking and heating water. If you sealed and insulated your structure well you won't need a large heat source. The steel plate stoves heat faster and throw off more heat than cast iron and some are portable for tents or houses on wheels. If you use wood you need a local supply on your own land or delivery. A good old ax, bow saw and limb saw is all you need to harvest wood and no gas needed. A wood sleigh is a helpful tool for bringing wood to your cabins. Cooling can be done using passive air flow, shade and natural breezes. Use natural tree shade, porches and cross ventilation to cool and circulate the air. A roof turbine and open windows on the cool side will push warm air up and out. Shades on windows and a large covered porch on the hot side will greatly reduce heat penetration and a white or reflective roof in hot and harsh climates is usually all you need and no AC required. Sanitation: You need to keep yourself clean and disease free so a shower/bath of some type which can be in a natural water source or from a homemade heated or unheated system. Water heated on a wood stove and a sponge bath or put in a bathing tub works and can also be used for washing clothes. Clothes line outside for drying. A scrub board or plunger washer and 5 gallon bucket gets clothes clean. Use a sawdust or composting toilet and outhouses may not be allowed some places. Composting is easy and the humanure is safe for use around some garden plants to build the soil or grow fruit trees, grazing areas or just put back in to the ground. Food supply and storage: You will want a garden and probably animals. Chickens are probably the easiest to raise and produce eggs and meat and can be free ranged and fed scraps to avoid purchasing food. Hens are social and you need at least 3-4 and a simple coop. No rooster needed for eggs unless you want to have breeding stock. Rabbits produce fast but require secure pens and are more susceptible to diseases. Pigs can be fed scraps and free ranged in some conditions but you need sturdy pens and pigs eat a lot for pound of meat produced. Larger stock needs grazing land and probably hay/grain in winter and require more experience and care to raise but many people raise goats and sheep on their homesteads. Gardens need water, good soil and sunshine. Know your growing zone and what grows best. Some foods like potatoes, squash and tubers can be stored for a long time in a root cellar. Learn to can/process so your excess will feed you all year. Root cellars, ice houses and spring houses (running water) were used by old times to keep food fresh. Research these and they require some experience to build and use but work well to store garden produce and smoking and meat curing can be used for storing meats. Hunting/trapping if allowed in your area requires practice and time and be a responsible care taker of the wildlife so as not to deplete it. Fishing will produce lots of food and takes less skill. You can raise fish in a pond or even in a kids wading pool. Research Tilapia and cat fish raising. Transportation: Unless you intend to stay continually at your shelter you will want some form of transportation. Hiking is good exercise and so is biking and requires no gas. Horses or a mule are an option but remember they eat a lot and need hay/grain in winter. Dog sledding may be an option. Summary: That is a fully off grid survival system with no electrical power needed. It will require more muscle power but if you are strong and healthy it is possible to live completely off grid and sustainably like the old timers with no or little help from the outside world. [My Cabin](https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/cabin%20vivid.jpg) Built for under $2000 with a lot of salvaged materials, windows and doors. I am not completely grid free but use those systems to reduce my grid use to only needing a 400 watt system, small genny for power tools and a small truck for transportation. I heat with propane and wood backup system. Water is free flowing well and I use a solar composting toilet of my own design. I choose to have a phone and internet to run a business and for security and socializing online. No house payments, no utility bills and freedom!</TEXT>

Water heated on a wood stove and a sponge bath or put in a bathing tub works and can also be used for washing clothes. Clothes line outside for drying. A scrub board or plunger washer and 5 gallon bucket gets clothes clean. Use a sawdust or composting toilet and outhouses may not be allowed some places. Composting is easy and the humanure is safe for use around some garden plants to build the soil or grow fruit trees, grazing areas or just put back in to the ground. Food supply and storage: You will want a garden and probably animals. Chickens are probably the easiest to raise and produce eggs and meat and can be free ranged and fed scraps to avoid purchasing food. Hens are social and you need at least 3-4 and a simple coop. No rooster needed for eggs unless you want to have breeding stock. Rabbits produce fast but require secure pens and are more susceptible to diseases. Pigs can be fed scraps and free ranged in some conditions but you need sturdy pens and pigs eat a lot for pound of meat produced. Larger stock needs grazing land and probably hay/grain in winter and require more experience and care to raise but many people raise goats and sheep on their homesteads. Gardens need water, good soil and sunshine. Know your growing zone and what grows best. Some foods like potatoes, squash and tubers can be stored for a long time in a root cellar. Learn to can/process so your excess will feed you all year. Root cellars, ice houses and spring houses (running water) were used by old times to keep food fresh. Research these and they require some experience to build and use but work well to store garden produce and smoking and meat curing can be used for storing meats. Hunting/trapping if allowed in your area requires practice and time and be a responsible care taker of the wildlife so as not to deplete it. Fishing will produce lots of food and takes less skill. You can raise fish in a pond or even in a kids wading pool. Research Tilapia and cat fish raising. Transportation: Unless you intend to stay continually at your shelter you will want some form of transportation. Hiking is good exercise and so is biking and requires no gas. Horses or a mule are an option but remember they eat a lot and need hay/grain in winter. Dog sledding may be an option. Summary: That is a fully off grid survival system with no electrical power needed. It will require more muscle power but if you are strong and healthy it is possible to live completely off grid and sustainably like the old timers with no or little help from the outside world. [My Cabin](https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/cabin%20vivid.jpg) Built for under $2000 with a lot of salvaged materials, windows and doors. I am not completely grid free but use those systems to reduce my grid use to only needing a 400 watt system, small genny for power tools and a small truck for transportation. I heat with propane and wood backup system. Water is free flowing well and I use a solar composting toilet of my own design. I choose to have a phone and internet to run a business and for security and socializing online. No house payments, no utility bills and freedom!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-11 16:04:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>The trailer is a little higher than the Wagon so I will let some air out of the tires and maybe dig a small trench to lower it enough to get he front end 1/3rd on the trailer and then slowly slide it in. Then I can do the finish work and roofing and put in that window without adding more weight. Eventually, I will make jack stands so I can unload the Wagon or leave it in the trailer for a guest bedroom. Wish me luck! #65279;</TEXT>

This guy contacted me because he has a brother that is paralyzed and in a wheel chair and he wants his independence and he asked if I could design a small house ADU they could build on their property for him to live in. This is a 12x16 with private bedroom and bathroom. Kitchen and living area with enough room for a wheel chair to navigate. 2x6 construction single level and would work well for a single person or couple. Couch can be a couch bed and would sleep 4. ADA kitchen. Base cabinet height is 32 inches and upper cabinets lowered to 6 foot. Accessible food prep area can double as table for eating. Exterior door is 3' and interior doors 32" required by ADA. #65279; ADA bathroom with 2 accordion doors. This opens up the bathroom for wheelchair access.Instead of a single door you have 2 accordion doors so the entire bathroom can be opened up for wheelchair access or just one door when needed. Easy to get in and out of shower and use toilet. #65279;  #8203; These are preliminary floor plans so I can place doors and windows as needed in the final plans. More pics coming and I will make the plans available.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Found some rolled aluminum roofing at Lowe's I think will work better than shingles and maintain the old Shepherd wagon look. Amerimax 20-in x 50-ft Aluminum Roll. I will go over to look at it tomorrow. Overlap the seams and it should be leak proof. Also cheaper than a couple tabs of shingles and faster to put on and reflects some of the suns heat off the Wagon. https://www.lowes.com/pd/Amerimax-20-in-x-50-ft-Aluminum-Roll-Flashing/3010400</TEXT>

Just got back from a ride and run with her in the dunes and she went in the backyard to get a drink from the stock tank and must have ran in to a skunk. She got sprayed in the face and knew she was in trouble because I have chewed her out for tangling with skunks before. One winter she got sprayed 4 times. This one must have surprised her as she has been good to stay away from them. Anyway, I keep a bottle of Febreeze around just for that and wiped her down to get the smell off but I also went looking for that skunk to put an end to him stealing eggs and hanging around. I had to dig my air rifle out and he was gone by the time I got out there so I decided I needed faster access to that rifle. I bought some metal wall hangers at the dollar store for the mudroom but they fit the gun stock so now that rifle is right over my day bed and loaded and ready for Mr. skunk. That is a Beeman pump 177 and has a range of 750 feet accurate. I prefer that for varmint control as if I miss it won't travel a mile in to the neighbors fields where we have animals and is still powerful enough to take down a skunk, coon, grey squirrel or any small varmints.

That design can be built several ways with a half loft, full loft with dormer window, no loft and shed roof, and designed as a sport/recreation cabin, guest house, granny flat, rental, ADU or ADA compliant for disabled people. I have 6 different floor plans just for that design. So, I will work on that this week and try to get plans done as soon as possible. I also need to get the roof on my Wagon and hot tub mudroom! #65279;</TEXT>

Once I figured out it was much easier to bend short pieces and cut slots I was able to get a nice clean edge. It wraps clear over the OSB edge and will have trim under the overhang so even better rain protection than shingles and a lot faster to install. #65279; ADDED: Tip of the day: Do not stare directly into sheet metal when roofing in the hot sun. I quickly put my sunglasses on. Got a second sheet on the opposite side. That is probably it for today and may work on the door trim this evening. #65279; UPDATE Got both sides done. Reminds me of an airstream trailer roof now. The sheet metal will work great and fairly easy to install. A 20" x 50ft roll covered the entire roof. Use wide lip sheet metal screws to attach. Can be bent with your hands in small sections.</TEXT>

There will be a moulding strip that goes under the overhang. It has that old Shepherd Wagon look I wanted now. ADDED: Front view of the door trim. I used 3 inch cedar fence boards for the trim because it is lightweight and withstands the weather. The trim will be sanded and stained to match the side trim and there will be 3 inch trim under that front overhang. I intentionally chose the boards with the most knots, lol! #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Roof tinned ](https://preview.redd.it/gqy7yv8u2tj51.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=21f83e39665f6fc0fefd30ae73f82d95ac88ca2b)  #8203; [Door trimmed](https://preview.redd.it/v169sb4y2tj51.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=98faab794d88280c80f9ddf53d2950703449a914) I decided to go with a galvanized roofing instead of shingles. Easier to install and wrapped over all edges to completely cover the OSB and be weather tight. I used wide lip sheet metal screws to attach the roofng. A roll of 20" x 50ft will do the entire roof and about the same cost as shingles and roofing felt but easier to install and can be formed by hand. There will be a moulding strip that goes under the overhang. It has that old Shepherd Wagon look I wanted now. Front view of the door trim. I used 3 inch cedar fence boards for the trim because it is lightweight and withstands the weather. The trim will be sanded and stained to match the side trim and there will be 3 inch trim under that front overhang. I intentionally chose the boards with the most knots, lol! #65279; I have free plans for the Wagon if anyone wants to build one.</TEXT>

I have been tackling the projects I have let go for awhile around my place and my cabin and yard needed some work and TLC. All houses need ongoing maintenance even off grid cabins and if you wait it piles up and can become a an eye sore or even dangerous. Still a few months of good weather here so I hope to have the yard all cleaned up and things stored properly and some needed repairs to the cabin done. Get the hot tub mudroom and wagon finished up. Take some time to look around your homesteads and see what needs repairing before winter and what is a possible danger to people and animals. Get it done and it won't cost as much later and will save you some grief. You can get a lot accomplished just setting aside an hour a day to work on your homesteads. #65279;</TEXT>

I found these 1 quart milk boxes at the dollar store by Gossner and they can be stored until ready to open and then refrigerated. Just the right size and great for your food storage needs. A little more expensive than a gallon of fresh milk but cheaper than buying fresh milk by the quart and if you need to store it for an emergency I would look at that, no water needed. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How much solar power does an average house need and how much does it cost: Answered in comments</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-08 09:07:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see some one posted a way oversized and tremendously expensive grid tied system on here that is misleading and discourages people from going to solar power so I wanted to clear up that misinformation. FOR PEOPLE CONSIDERING SOLAR U.S Energy Information Administration, [in 2016 the average American household used 897 kWh per month.](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97 amp;t=3) "The average system size in the U.S. is 5kW (5000 watts)" As of July 2020, the average cost of solar in the U.S. is **$2.91** per watt ($14,550 for a 5 kilowatt system). That means that the total 5kW solar system cost would be $10,767 after the 26% Federal ITC discount (not factoring in any additional state rebates or incentives). That is a realistic system and not the $100k system that person is claiming he needs. If you are using propane or wood heat you can probably use an even smaller system and 3.5KW is average. There are Fed rebates and states may also have a rebate so check on that. If you are grid tied that system will pay for itself in 10-15 years on average. Off grid houses use low power appliances and systems so they can use even less solar power and my own system is just 400 watts. I hope that helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good morning all! I slept in for a change. My CFS kicked up for a few days and nerve itches was keeping me awake and irritated. It looks like we will get a sunny day today after a week of smoky skies and a little snow. I guess CA and Oregon are really having fire troubles. My son and his family are in Oregon and sent me pics of the nasty orange sky. They are not near the fires luckily. Anyway, I need to work on some projects of my own like getting the roof on the hot tub mudroom but I did get a special request for an 8x16 on a trailer design so maybe work on that and share some pics. I will do a video of the Studio and Cottage cabins this weekend. Go check out the new Studio and Cottage cabin designs. I am very happy with these designs and the cost for the Studio and Desperado came to $2,275.50 and the Cottage Cabin came to $2,886.64 not including door or windows and that is a price most people can afford. I included recommendations for solar and off grid systems and a porch and studio addition. Plans are here: [https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/studiocottageaduplans.htm](https://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/studiocottageaduplans.htm) Have a great weekend everybody and stay safe out there! #65279;</TEXT>

This has 7 foot side walls and 8 feet to the peak and is designed to be low profile and low weight to be towed by a standard truck or SUV. This unit has a master bedroom and no loft and bed can be full or twin size. Wardrobe and shelves for storage in the bedroom and an entertainment center with TV. There is a side door in to the bedroom and I show this with either a sliding glass door or standard door and windows on the end by the living area. That is your main entrance. The Loveseat couch bed pulls out to sleep 2 guests. Comfy gas fireplace and big screen TV. This has a a nice kitchen with good storage below the sink and wall cabinets. Built in fridge with microwave above and pull out micro-washer below. Two burner cooktop. Small kitchen bar and prep area. Bathroom is a wet bath style for more room. Framing is all 2x4 with R13 insulation and I show this with faux brick and siding and would look very nice in any park model court or on your own property or for digital nomads working on the road. This was designed for a guy that just got out of the service and wants to travel and live without paying rent and he rides dirt bikes. The trailer comes with ramps so he can store his bike in the living area when on the move. The 60EC trailer runs about $2500 new and you could build the house for probably around $2500- $3000. I would look around for a used trailer or Big Tex will finance one for about $50 a month. [https://www.bigtextrailers.com/60ec-economy-tandem-axle-car-hauler](https://www.bigtextrailers.com/60ec-economy-tandem-axle-car-hauler) This would be a good size house for 1 or 2 people that intend to move to new places and adventures!  #8203; ADDED: For Catman the Uber Driver from the big shitty that has never built anything in his life but wants to tell other people how to build cabins and THOWs.

This has 7 foot side walls and 8 feet to the peak and is designed to be low profile and low weight to be towed by a standard truck or SUV. This unit has a master bedroom and no loft and bed can be full or twin size. Wardrobe and shelves for storage in the bedroom and an entertainment center with TV. There is a side door in to the bedroom and I show this with either a sliding glass door or standard door and windows on the end by the living area. That is your main entrance. The Loveseat couch bed pulls out to sleep 2 guests. Comfy gas fireplace and big screen TV. This has a a nice kitchen with good storage below the sink and wall cabinets. Built in fridge with microwave above and pull out micro-washer below. Two burner cooktop. Small kitchen bar and prep area. Bathroom is a wet bath style for more room. Framing is all 2x4 with R13 insulation and I show this with faux brick and siding and would look very nice in any park model court or on your own property or for digital nomads working on the road. This was designed for a guy that just got out of the service and wants to travel and live without paying rent and he rides dirt bikes. The trailer comes with ramps so he can store his bike in the living area when on the move. The 60EC trailer runs about $2500 new and you could build the house for probably around $2500- $3000. I would look around for a used trailer or Big Tex will finance one for about $50 a month. [https://www.bigtextrailers.com/60ec-economy-tandem-axle-car-hauler](https://www.bigtextrailers.com/60ec-economy-tandem-axle-car-hauler) This would be a good size house for 1 or 2 people that intend to move to new places and adventures!</TEXT>

So I am installing a Procom blue flame 10K heater that has a thermostat. I have had one of these before and they work well for small cabins. I prefer the Radiant because you can feel the heat instantly when you sit in front of it but the blue flame work fine for small space heating. I will keep the Radiant heater for backup and maybe install that in the Wagon for when I don't want to use the wood stove. Anyway, here is the Procom 10K heater if anyone is interested: [Procom 10K heater](https://amzn.to/3hyfQOk)</TEXT>

I decided I need to do an update video about off grid heating/cooking and include info on types of propane heaters and wood stoves and some installation and safety tips. Also a little about generators since that has been a real safety issue this year. Now that we are heading in to colder weather and people are looking for heating appliances this would be a good time for that and I am replacing my heater anyway so I have the different equipment to show you. Anyway, hope you all have a great Monday</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cabin cleaning project: New blinds, cabinets and freshened up the place</TITLE>

    <TEXT> #8203; [New blinds for the cabin](https://preview.redd.it/014ytg82edn51.jpg?width=6000 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=67e31290ec32236e8fe9e5860029117c6ffe563a) OK, the blinds are up and one cabinet cleaned. You may think "so what" but this is a hard task for me as leaning over and working on anything higher than my head is what throws my back into spasms, but the lady friend is coming up this weekend so I wanted it to look nice for her and it really needed to be cleaned and freshened up. I like the mini-blinds and for $8 they are actually well made and easy to install. Think I will get 4 more for the loft windows and mud room windows. One thing about living in a small cabin to know is you need a good kitchen exhaust fan. I didn't have one for a long time and anything you cook puts off small amounts of oil/grease that settles on everything. It is even worse in a small cabin and we get oil field trucks that kick up dust so you get ugly yellow greasy dust stuck to stuff. My white cabinets were orange and so are the inside of my doors from it. I have a vent hood over the stove now so not as bad but a couple times a year I have to scrub stuff down to get that gunk off. #65279;</TEXT>

I mean old and it is out of a camper that was as old as I am but it works very well and was a fancy model for it's day. I salvaged the stove out of the camper I was living in before I built the cabin. The top comes off and the cast iron burners lift off so they can be scrubbed. I was afraid of what I might find under the top but it was actually pretty clean and just some dried stuff to clean out. I don't use the oven on it anymore and I light the burners as needed instead of using the pilot just in case. I have a toaster oven if I need it but I use the microwave more than that. Anyway, the stove is all cleaned up now and the burners and knobs are soaking. Time for lunch and a Siesta. #65279;</TEXT>

In college I pursued an associate degree in drafting but was stopped by the college pulling the course before I could finish.

I am a long time off grid homesteader and built my own off grid cabin 20 years ago next month. Since then I have written several books and made videos to help other people to simplify their lives, go off grid and become more self reliant. I raise chickens, garden, orchard, dogs and a little hell when I can. If you are interested in that lifestyle I have many off grid cabin and project designs on my profile and always happy to help with questions about homesteading, off grid living and simple living. If the Mods don't object I will share some of those projects here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When people think about off gridders they usually have an image of Dick Proenneke hiking off in to the backwoods of Alaska to build a log cabin and live a lifestyle cut off from technology or maybe they read Walden and envision Thoreau and his tiny cabin and simple living ideology.

Being self sufficient and self reliant is a lofty goal and people often think of the 'good old days' when people hunted and grew their own food and made their own clothing and you certainly can do that at least to some extent but the reality is the old homesteaders like my parents were happy when technology came around that let them have electric lights, TV and phones, indoor plumbing, a stove you didn't have to cut wood for and the safety of having a hospital and medical care nearby if needed. Most off gridders and homesteaders today (myself included) try to find a balance between doing things for ourselves and being able to take care of our families needs with the focus on reducing our burden on society and being independent and capable of surviving hard times and thriving in good times. For most that means, gardening, raising animals, building your own houses and having your own energy sources and having the skills and knowledge to do things if society was to collapse. Technology like computers, internet, solar and wind power are tools we use towards that end but with the understanding that you should never rely on those technologies so much that you couldn't survive with out them. So don't get down on yourselves or think you are not self sufficient or self reliant because you use technology and just keep in mind that these are tools and you need skills and knowledge that comes with hands on living to use tools and not become overly dependent on technology. #65279;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-18 14:06:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>This was an article of mine published in Backwoodsman magazine several years ago that might be of interest to people here. Build Your Own Off-Grid Cabin  #8203; [My cabin](https://preview.redd.it/4vhk83mvwwn51.jpg?width=455 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=f0edba58b286651905b0dba32258f2df6e904056)  #8203; [Cabin Framing](https://preview.redd.it/vdiv7vi8xwn51.png?width=636 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=f2e2bcb3dea9349c7eeb3041d36ccb609207dc26)  #8203; [Half or full loft framing](https://preview.redd.it/mlq4at0bxwn51.png?width=413 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=62883648019c7a50eba9efae44e55a33c71c271c) This cabin design is for a 14x14 off-grid cabin which is the exact same cabin that I have lived in for over 15 years. Many rural counties still allow people to build a dry cabin on their own property under 200 square feet for recreational or temporary living. There are usually some county rules that apply. The cabin has to be under 200 sqare feet (check with your county) and must not be on a permanent foundation so it could be moved, and it may not be hooked to any permanent power source, water source or septic utility. Always check with your county before doing any building. COST: I built my cabin for under $2000 and used recycled doors and windows and some rough sawn lumber but most of the materials were new and available at any lumber yard. FOUNDATION: All cabins need a good foundation and old homestead cabins usually used whatever rocks they could find for a solid foundation and you could still do that but now we have Deck Blocks that are designed just for that purpose and these are available at any home supply store. POWER AND LIGHTS: I use a small solar electric and wind turbine system but kerosene lamps would be fine or if you are just using it for recreation a small generator would work or go no power and rough it. SEPTIC SYTEM: I use a composting toilet and my porta-potty is emptied once a week into an outside solar composter. You can get commercial composting toilets or build your own. Plans are on the web. You can add interior walls wherever you want them and I put in a 5x7 bathroom and a full loft or you could go with a half loft as pictured. If you place the loft height a 7 feet you will have approximately 7 feet of head room to the peak in the loft. Plenty of room in the loft for a bedroom and I also have my office up there. I use a small solar electric and wind turbine for power and that cabin is setup like a self-contained RV with a 25 gallon water tank and DC water pump and I use a composting toilet. I have a propane stove and a wood stove for cooking and heating water. You can make these cabins as rustic and backwoods as you want or have a few niceties if you want. Materials can be recycled and I used recycled doors and windows and rough sawn lumber and recycled cedar fence for interior work. The front porch is optional but what is a cabin without a nice front porch and a rocking chair. I used logs and rough sawn wood for the porch. So that is my 14x14 off-grid cabin design and I have been living in mine for over 15 years. I have no house payments and no utility bills and I hunt and fish and raise a garden and animals for most of my food so my living expenses are very low. That lets me spend more time in the backwoods doing what I enjoy and adventuring. [My Cabin Construction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qghZ2ao7GKM)</TEXT>

This has a good sized bedroom with full size bed and lots of storage and an entertainment center. Bedroom has it's own exterior door access. Good kitchen space with an RV style built in fridge, slide in micro-washer, microwave, 2 burner cooktop and kitchen bar. You can replace the kitchen bar and put in a full RV cook top and oven. Large wet bath style bathroom. Full size bed couch and entertainment center in the living area or you can do a gas fireplace and big screen TV. This sleeps 4 people and would be a good size for people that like to entertain and have guests or for a small family. These trailers are designed as car haulers and can handle the weight and the house is designed with 7 foot side walls and 8 foot to the peak with no loft to reduce weight and low profile for towing with a standard truck. Trailer is around $3K but you may find a used one and Big Tex will finance one for under $100 a month.

    <TITLE>Sustainable life project: How to be an off grid millionaire!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-19 12:46:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK, I am not a millionaire but I have been off grid for 20 years and have learned a lot from that experience in how to make money and reduce your living expenses so that if you want to be wealthy the sky is the limit. First and foremost is to get rid of that house payment and utility bills. Getting rid of those expenses and building or buying a smaller well built and well insulated house or cabin that is powered by solar system will greatly reduce your living expenses and put a huge chunk of money back in your pocket. Calculate how much you are spending on a house payment or rent and utility bills each month. What would you do without those payments? If your home is almost paid for consider paying it off early and getting out from under those interest payments and utility bills with a grid tied solar system. On average people pay $1500 a month (or much more in the big city) for a house and utility bills every month. That is $18K a year so in 20 years you have spent over a third of a million dollars you could save if you didn't have those payments. Next is to reduce unnecessary expenses. These are the things like eating out, shopping for clothes you don't really need, having the latest phone and gadgets, having the latest truck or car and other unnecessary spending that the media advertisers have convinced people they need to be cool. A new I-phone costs almost $1500 and a new truck costs $30-50K. That is a whole lot of money you are spending to be fashionable and cool. The average person spends about $200 a month on entertainment and $200 a month for eating out at restaurants and fast food joints and buying drinks and snacks. That is another $100K over 20 years you could be saving. The average family of four spends around $1800 per year on clothes, with $388 of this on shoes. Now I am not saying live like a pauper and wear ragged clothes and drive a dangerous old beater but consider how you can reduce those expenses by eating at home more, getting your entertainment for free and not always buying the latest gadgets and cool stuff to impress people. Finally, consider investing some of that savings in a way it produces more income. This can be a small business, selling crafts or something you grow or produce or getting a skill that you can profit from or exchange in barter for the stuff you need. People today want experiences and adventures and healthy living and food. Find a way to fill a niche in your community and provide those products and services people are looking for. The internet has made starting a business much easier and the world is your customer. I know lots of off gridders and homesteaders that have a small local business selling their farmstead animals, produce and crafts and many that are skilled at construction, art, welding, mechanic work landscaping, handyman or even computer programming and writing. Some work as guides and others have rental cabins and some work for other people just when they want or they work for themselves and set their own schedules and make enough to cover their own expenses, and can make very good money for saving for an early retirement, or helping your kids and grandkids go to college, buy a home or start their own businesses, like I did. So, that is how you get to be an off grid millionaire and I calculate I have saved over a million in expenses in my 20 years off grid and have built a sustainable life with no house payments and no utility bills and a healthy retirement account to survive the hard times and thrive in the good times and you can too. That is true freedom! How much would having that financial security be worth to you and your family? #65279;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If you have a pond and build a houseboat on it would you have to have permits or pay property taxes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-19 15:28:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just thinking out loud. I have a nice reservoir near my cabin and have been thinking about building a small pontoon house boat. I know there are places where you can dock your house boats and live pretty much for free. So if you have land and a pond could you build a house boat without permits and property taxes on the house? Just something to think on for the weekend!  #8203; ADDED: Just for fun here is an 8x12 Houseboat design: [https://www.reddit.com/r/livingofftheland/comments/ivypt7/just\_for\_fun\_8x12\_houseboat\_design/](https://www.reddit.com/r/livingofftheland/comments/ivypt7/just_for_fun_8x12_houseboat_design/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My 400 watt off grid power system.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-23 23:27:36</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; [My 400 watt off grid system](https://preview.redd.it/x689f15xezo51.jpg?width=595 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=36bb616a6903ddc616a1eae6f93fc11eeab9989b) It has been over 4 years now since I switched over from a 580 watt system made up of mismatched old panels and mismatched flooded cell batts to a 400 watt system of all the same panels and batts and since then I have done zero maintenance to my system. I went to Renogy 100 watt panels and three 125AH AGM sealed batts from Vmaxtank and a small 175 watt inverter without a fan made by Go Power. I use a Bluesky 30 amp MPPT controller and my batts are always full by 10AM if the sun is shining and I can go 3 days with low sunshine from the batts, no problem. I run a shurflo water pump for showering and sinks and I use an RV style 25 gallon water tank that sits under my sink and is filled from my free flowing well as needed. That pump has never stopped working and was originally out of an old camper so I am not even sure how old it is. I use an Alpicool C20 12 volt fridge that runs 24.7 off DC and has plenty of room for a weeks worth of food. It can keep frozen food froze at the bottom and cold foods on top. Also good for camping and trips. I use LED lights and I have some that have their own 5 watt solar panel and LION battery and others that I can recharge from USB. I have several USB ports and cigg lighter style ports in my cabin. I use the inverter for running my laptop computer which is always on because I run a small business online and also used for a fan, small swamp cooler and recharging gadgets. I have a microwave and power tools and a vacuum and washing machine I run off a 1200 watt Champion genny only occasionally and my heat is a small 10K BTU propane furnace with wood stove back up and I use an Eccotemp L5 propane OD water heater that has never once let me down. I use an RV propane oven range also salvaged out of my old camper. That is my small off grid system and I have lots of gadgets like most people do but that is all the power I need to live comfortably off grid, going on 20 years off grid next month. #65279;</TEXT>

I went to Renogy 100 watt panels and three 125AH AGM sealed batts from Vmaxtank and a small 175 watt inverter without a fan made by Go Power. I use a Bluesky 30 amp MPPT controller and my batts are always full by 10AM if the sun is shining and I can go 3 days with low sunshine from the batts, no problem. I run a shurflo water pump for showering and sinks and I use an RV style 25 gallon water tank that sits under my sink and is filled from my free flowing well as needed. That pump has never stopped working and was originally out of an old camper so I am not even sure how old it is. I use an Alpicool C20 12 volt fridge that runs 24.7 off DC and has plenty of room for a weeks worth of food. It can keep frozen food froze at the bottom and cold foods on top. Also good for camping and trips. I use LED lights and I have some that have their own 5 watt solar panel and LION battery and others that I can recharge from USB. I have several USB ports and cigg lighter style ports in my cabin. I use the inverter for running my laptop computer which is always on because I run a small business online and also used for a fan, small swamp cooler and recharging gadgets. I have a microwave and power tools and a vacuum and washing machine I run off a 1200 watt Champion genny only occasionally and my heat is a small 10K BTU propane furnace with wood stove back up and I use an Eccotemp L5 propane OD water heater that has never once let me down. I use an RV propane oven range also salvaged out of my old camper. That is my small off grid system and I have lots of gadgets like most people do but that is all the power I need to live comfortably off grid, going on 20 years off grid next month. #65279;</TEXT>

That is my 12x12 Whippoorwill Design and happy to see it being built for people that really need that housing. #65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As they ramp up production the prices for batts will come down and several new EVs coming out in the $25K range next year. Even though the warranty is for 100K the expectation is an EV batt will get 200K under average conditions so about the same as a gas car and most new car buyers buy a new vehicle after 7-10 years anyway. That will put a lot of used EVs on the market with still a 100K left in the batt and you can get a new batt pack for it if needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The main factor is whether you drive highway miles and take long trips or just a daily commuter. That will effect how long the batt pack will last but that life expectancy is 200K miles and warranted for 100K miles. Then it can be replaced for another 200k range.

    <TEXT>Funny you should mention computers- I am also an AI and game programmer. I know, doesn't fit that profile, lol! Like computer chips the tech for EVs will all come down in price and they will last longer without needing the next model. The problem you are describing is more of a corporate scheme by some big companies to keep you tied to their products and was also used by big oil to keep EVs off the market but it didn't work because that technology is in public domain and if US manufacturers won't deliver it then China and Japan will be happy to take over that market. I promote the use of well built sustainable technology that reduces our impact on society and the environment and is affordable for the average person. I have kids and grand kids now so you younger people will have to fight that battle and all I can do is try and set an example. Best on your adventures in life!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A 2018 study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found that electric vehicles cost less than half as much to operate as gas-powered cars. The average cost to operate an EV in the United States is $485 per year, while the average for a gasoline-powered vehicle is $1,117 https://www.energysage.com/electric-vehicles/costs-and-benefits-evs/evs-vs-fossil-fuel-vehicles/#:~:text=A%202018%20study%20from%20the,gasoline%2Dpowered%20vehicle%20is%20%241%2C117.

    <TEXT>Using new lightweight compounds and better aerodynamics they can get the weight down significantly and using green hydrogen they get a cheap clean fuel. I was telling people 5 years ago hydrogen would replace fossil fuels for many vehicles and especially fleet vehicles and it is now happening. Commercial passenger jets are still a ways off but is already in use for trains, cargo ships, buses and big rigs and China and Japan are gong big in to hydrogen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Without getting in to the religious issues: The pandemic should be a wake up call that our national and world security is very fragile and one little virus can wipe out major economies and cause severe hardships even if it doesn't cause a lot of deaths. Covid shut down travel and caused countries to blame and point fingers and retract deals and and we did not respond well at all to the needs of the most vulnerable in our own countries or other countries that needed more help. I think a lot of that falls on the shoulders of the US government that has always been looked to as a leader in times of disaster and instead became the epitome of negligence and apathy and poor reaction to the virus. The US has become so consumer centric that people can't/won't tolerate even a little discomfort or interruption in their spending and buying habits or even wear a simple mask to stop the spread of the virus. The corruption also came out full force and some companies seen opportunities to cash in on people's needs and fears. I don't know the answer but this was just a drill for what we should be prepared for and we have and are failing miserably!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People just aren't that in to you- big oil! Some of that is because people are taking climate change more seriously and putting pressure on their accountants to get out of fossil fuels but I am betting more has to do with the rapid increase in solar and wind and now hydrogen that is a great investment. We have reached the tipping point where clean renewable energy is cheaper than any fossil fuel and it can be installed fast for a fast return without the massive upfront costs of nuclear or other energy sources. Return on investment is faster. There are also major state lawsuits hanging over the heads of big oil and coal that could do serious damage to their future projects and EV cars are starting to ramp up with charging being installed. BP and Shell moving in to renewables and GE will never build another coal power plant. So, the future looks very good for investing in renewables for at least 5-10 years while fossil fuels future is uncertain and probably in decline. If you are looking for the next big thing to invest in I would look at green hydrogen!</TEXT>

Kia, Honda, Toyota, Chevy and other companies are bringing out lower priced EVs with a range getting close to that 300+ mile mark that makes them competitive with any gas car and hydrogen is the likely fuel for big rigs instead of batteries.

I agree it is not likely and the article states it is not likely but considering we knew the dangers of the wet markets to possible pathogen transmission and now we have over a million dead from Covid maybe we should start taking these risks a bit more seriously and warming climate will increase that risk from pathogens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Any pathogen that effected any mammal could also effect humans. In August 2016, in a remote corner of Siberian tundra called the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic Circle, a 12-year-old boy died and at least twenty people were hospitalised after being infected by anthrax. The theory is that, over 75 years ago, a reindeer infected with anthrax died and its frozen carcass became trapped under a layer of frozen soil, known as permafrost. There it stayed until a heatwave in the summer of 2016, when the permafrost thawed. This exposed the reindeer corpse and released infectious anthrax into nearby water and soil, and then into the food supply. More than 2,000 reindeer grazing nearby became infected, which then led to the small number of human cases. "Permafrost is a very good preserver of microbes and viruses, because it is cold, there is no oxygen, and it is dark," says evolutionary biologist Jean-Michel Claverie at Aix-Marseille University in France.

    <TEXT>An AGI for practical purposes will be more like an idiot savant capable of super fast information retrieval and processing but lacking emotional feedback, personal experiences and independent motivations that most humans possess that leads to creativity. That type of AGI works well when decision making follows a more linear path and basically replicates the logic process of humans but a lot faster and without distractions. I design personal assistant and personal trainer AI which does mimic human qualities and used for motivation and companionship. That is a different level of intelligence and follows Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Both have their place and used together you could potentially achieve a true AGI but, just as in humans, when you mix emotional response with logic you can get some outcomes that might not be good for you or humanity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That might be true if the humans involved were not likely to travel and interact with other people. As the arctic melts it is also opening up lands that will attract more people either as tourists or to use that land which increases the likelihood of transmission. It is also causing migration of animals to change which may spread that pathogen to a wider population. I am not a doomsayer that this will happen but just as our lack of preparation for Covid should teach us we need to consider these risks and monitor and prepare for new outbreaks of potentially deadly pathogens.</TEXT>

RMI finds that since 2018, the queue for clean energy projects has more than doubled while the queue for gas projects has been cut in half. In all, more than $30 billion worth of gas projects have been canceled or abandoned. Currently, the capacity of wind, solar, and storage projects slated for construction in ERCOT and PJM is ten times greater than for new gas projects."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a good idea to connect different watt and amp panels together or batts with different AH ratings. It will likely confuse your controller and reduce efficiency and batts won't get fully charged and could damage the batts. It can be done but I would recommend separate charge controllers. Your 100 watt panel matched with a 50-100AH battery would probably provide more power than the system you described and handle your inverter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some reading for you: Did MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems Mislead Fusion Investors? " MIT has not disclosed to the public, and perhaps not to its investors, two other crucial values. The first value is the electrical power required to create the 30 MW of thermal heating power. New Energy Times asked Martin Greenwald, a founding member of the SPARC team and the deputy director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center, for that value. New Energy Times also asked Brandon Sorbom, chief scientific officer of Commonwealth Fusion Systems. Neither of them responded to e-mails or phone messages. " " Two years ago, New Energy Times spoke with Laban Coblentz, the spokesman for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The ITER reactor is designed to use 50 MW of injected thermal power to heat the fuel. Coblentz told New Energy Times that 150 MW of electricity would be required to power the radio frequency and neutral beam injection systems that produce the 50 MW of heating power injected into ITER. If the conversion efficiency is the same with SPARC, it will require 90 MW of electricity to heat the fuel. The second crucial value that MIT omitted is the total input electrical power required to operate the SPARC reactor. SPARC is not designed to produce electricity; the output will be measured only in the thermal power produced by the fusion plasma.

    <TEXT>From the article: " The American public is facing a potential bill of $280 billion for the cleanup of 2.6 million unplugged oil and gas wells, according to [Billion Dollar Orphans,](https://carbontracker.org/reports/billion-dollar-orphans/) a new report from London-based think tank Carbon #160;Tracker. While this number is alarming, it does not even include an estimated 1.2 million undocumented orphan #160;oil and gas #160;wells. 'Orphan wells' is an industry term for non-producing oil and gas wells that  #8220;have no financially viable operator capable of plugging them. #8221; With the current state of the oil and gas industry, the number of financially viable operators is rapidly decreasing while bankruptcies rise, which is exacerbating this whole #160;issue. #160; One troubling aspect of this problem is that it should not exist. Regulators at both the federal and state levels have the tools in place to hold companies accountable for the costs of well plugging and abandonment. Yet those regulators have not used those tools, and now, as the industry is struggling financially, in many cases it simply may be too #160;late. #160; Ideally when an oil and gas company applies for a permit to drill a new well it would be required by regulators to purchase a [surety bond](https://suretygroup.com/surety-bond/oil-and-gas-well-drilling-bond/) from a third party that would cover the cost of plugging and abandoning the well when it had finished producing oil or gas. This should even protect against the possibility of the oil and gas operator going #160;bankrupt. #160; But regulators have set the limits for those surety bonds far below the actual costs to plug and abandon wells. Carbon Tracker estimates that these bonds currently would only cover approximately 1% of the estimated $280 billion clean up tab  #8212; leaving the rest of the bill to be paid by the #160;public." They should also not be allowed to start another energy business until they clean up their old mess and produce a surety bond. Time to start suing the hell out of oil companies that do this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the article: " If countries want to lower emissions as substantially, rapidly and cost-effectively as possible, they should prioritize support for renewables, rather than nuclear power. That's the finding of new analysis of 123 countries over 25 years by the University of Sussex Business School and the ISM International School of Management which reveals that nuclear energy programmes around the world tend not to deliver sufficient carbon emission reductions and so should not be considered an effective low carbon energy source. Researchers found that unlike renewables, countries around the world with larger scale national nuclear attachments do not tend to show significantly lower carbon emissions -- and in poorer countries nuclear programmes actually tend to associate with relatively higher emissions. Published today in *Nature Energy*, the study reveals that nuclear and renewable energy programmes do not tend to co-exist well together in national low-carbon energy systems but instead crowd each other out and limit effectiveness."

Where our uranium-comes-from: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/ End of discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your sources: N #233;stor A. Sep #250;lveda is a Ph.D. student at the department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. Nothing in your links studies the cost effectiveness of nuclear. Your opinion of Lazard's that is the US standard in energy cost analysis is nonsense. "Wind are perfectly sited in the sunniest and windiest locations. They also assume there is 0 solar and wind on the grid. If there is too much solar or wind on grid the prices will actually turn negative(meaning you have to pay people to take your electricity) which will increase the real costs." That is the most ridiculous thing you have posted and complete nonsense. You are saying solar and wind are too good and produce excess so we shouldn't use them and instead use expensive nuclear, lol!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How safe are hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in a crash? In fact, many feel that H2 can be considered to be considerably safer than cars powered by gasoline. Primarily, if there is a gasoline leak, there is a mess and a significant fire risk. In the event of a hydrogen leak, the gas simply dissipates harmlessly. Moreover, the tanks that contain H2 are thick walled and carefully designed to prevent leaking, even after a substantial crash. The tanks in the Mirai, for example, are carbon fiber wrapped and can withstand a .50 caliber bullet without suffering a leak. The Nexo are made differently but can withstand the pressure of the gas up to 10,000 psi. The tanks in hydrogen fuel vehicles also feature relief devices that cause the gas to be vented in certain circumstances in order to avoid heat-induced explosions. For example, should the tanks ever be punctured, the device allows for a managed venting of the gas. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles safety - car crashSensors throughout the vehicle also work to detect unexpected gas presence to shut everything down and bring the vehicle to a stop before anything can be permitted to ignite. https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/how-safe-are-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-in-a-crash/8539783/</TEXT>

By contrast, hydrogen has an energy density of approximately 120 MJ/kg, almost three times more than diesel or gasoline. "Price is another attractive attribute of hydrogen. Diesel prices are currently hovering close to $3.00 per gallon, and with the recent curtailment of Saudi Arabian oil production, it #8217;s reasonable to expect further price increases for diesel. But on the hydrogen front, recent analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggests the per-kilo production price for hydrogen could be as low as $1.40 per kilogram in about a decade."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, you need a better controller and preferably MPPT. Here is a PWM 40 amp controller that will work but I have not used this brand: https://amzn.to/30CEXK2 Here is the Renogy MPPT and I use their panels but not the controller: https://amzn.to/30DDUcI I would avoid the Chinese controllers claiming to be MPPT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Batteries are great for cars that can be recharged overnight at home but we are talking about semi rigs and the batts weight for that application would outweigh the benefits and would take hours to recharge compared to 15 minutes for hydrogen. That hydrogen will be produced on site from clean cheap solar and wind and will be as cheap or even cheaper than diesel as it becomes wide spread. That is why these companies like Toyota and Kenworth are producing those trucks now because that is the future for fleet vehicles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The industry apparently disagrees and is moving to hydrogen for fleet vehicles. Keep in mind the cost of replacing a battery bank is very expensive for a semi and time is money. Hydrogen is already ramping up to meet that demand and these are just a few of those projects now in use: Brookfield Renewable to Supply Plug Power's First Green Hydrogen Plant With Renewable Energy "The power supply deal with Brookfield Renewable will enable Plug Power to produce 10 tons of liquid hydrogen per day from emissions-free renewable energy." https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iyz0fl/brookfield_renewable_to_supply_plug_powers_first/ World's largest green-hydrogen plant begins operation in Austria https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant-begins-operation-in-austria/2-1-708381 https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ih0jym/cummins_using_hydrogen_technology_to_enable/ https://www.powermag.com/group-says-it-will-launch-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-project/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/irgt2v/worlds_largest_hydro_dam_could_send_cheap_green/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ii6msi/global_green_hydrogen_project_pipeline_reaches_50/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not that hard to understand that in order to get that range you need more batts and that increases weight reducing efficiency. There is a point of diminished return with adding batts. You also have to consider charge time for batts would be hours compared to minutes for hydrogen and replacing a batt bank for a semi would be a huge expense. Musk is just promoting his brand and Toyota, Daimler and Kenworth have been producing semi trucks a lot longer than he has and is going with hydrogen. https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1129652_daimler-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-semi-production-late-2020s</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Musk is hyping his brand. If he can get that range with a loaded semi he still needs to prove it. Not that it can't be done but that the weight and size of the batt pack to do it would be tremendous. Maybe we will get better batts in the future but as it stands now hydrogen is the better fuel for fleet vehicles with a longer drive range and looks like the industry agrees.</TEXT>

Nuclear costs 10x as much as solar per KW, takes billions in upfront costs, takes many years to build and has expensive security and waste issues and uses a finite material many countries do not have. Where our uranium-comes-from: [https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php) "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." [https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/](https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/)  #8203; Solar is already replacing nuclear and the new solar farm in China produces more energy than any nuclear plant at a tenth the cost per KW with none of the waste and security costs and issues.

    <TEXT>From the article: On Monday, the B20 leadership made 25 policy recommendations for the G-20 group. Each recommendation fell into three key areas: empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers. ### 1. Empowering people Under the area of empowering people, the B20 made 10 recommendations aimed at accelerating efforts to empower women and youth and to build workforces resilient to technological, health and economic risks. It also called for a scaling up of financing for sustainable development and economic diversification, including in job-creating sectors such as sustainable tourism. The group also urged substantial progress on trade cooperation. Specifically, the B20 called on the G-20 to strengthen the multilateral trade and investment system by rolling back protectionism, supporting open markets and  #8220;enforcing and enhancing the rulebook to ensure a global level playing field #8221; through institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). #160;  #8220;The business community strongly supports a robust multilateral trading systm anchored in the WTO, #8221; the group said.  #8220;But the system faces a crisis that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, #8221; it added. The recommendation comes as trade and technology tensions continue to drive a wedge between the United States and China, and concern over the Trump administration #8217;s efforts to use sanctions as a tool of foreign policy leverage to address issues of reciprocity in its key trading relationships. #160; ### 2. Safeguarding the planet The B20 made three recommendations to  #8220;foster growth within the limits of the planet. #8221; Specifically, it recommended G-20 leaders commit to carbon neutrality in the second half of the century, preferably by 2050, and accelerate the implementation of policies toward that goal. #160;  #8220;Our planet is under greater pressure than at any point in human history, #8221; the group said. #160; ### 3. Shaping new frontiers Under the area of shaping new frontiers, the B20 made another 12 recommendations, focusing on enhancing the environment for fintech and leveraging technologies to manage risks related to corruption and fraud. #160; It recommends investment in digital infrastructure like the next generation of wireless technology systems known as 5G, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things  #8212;  #160;which refers to devices connected to the internet like home appliances and cars that can be controlled via apps. Specifically, it recommends a  #8220;comprehensive, balanced and high standard WTO agreement #8221; to foster the growth of e-commerce.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-07 00:10:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Some of you may not have even been alive 20 years ago so here are a few major changes that happened in the last 20 years: You're now on the internet more than you aren't on the internet, instead of just using it for school or work. Today, you can talk on the phone and use the internet at the same time. You no longer have to worry about breathing in secondhand smoke when going out to eat. You now get more excited about television than you do about movies. You no longer have to sit around hoping your Napster song download goes through. You rent movies off Amazon Prime instead of heading to Blockbuster. Eating at a restaurant has become a social experience. You can no longer go on vacation and truly take a break from everything. Many people see terrorist attacks a more of a looming threat today. You probably also have a much bigger fear of mass shootings today than you did 20 years ago. You now get updates from the president of the United States on Twitter. You no longer have to memorize anyone's phone numbers. You text instead of leaving voicemails. Everyone has a smartphone, and most people don't even know what a Nokia is. You have to take your shoes off when you fly now. Online dating is the norm today. You have the option to watch television without commercials. You now take photos on your cell phone instead of a film camera. You use Google Chrome instead of Internet Explorer. You make playlists instead of burning CDs. The global population has exploded. And more and more people are living in cities. Buildings are reaching previously unimaginable heights. The internet has changed the way we do  #8230; everything. Social media has taken over. People no longer believe in banks. Climate change is becoming a grim reality. List courtesy of: [https://www.insider.com/how-life-has-changed-in-the-last-20-years-2018-12#you-make-playlists-instead-of-burning-cds-20](https://www.insider.com/how-life-has-changed-in-the-last-20-years-2018-12#you-make-playlists-instead-of-burning-cds-20) So what big changes have you seen in the development of humanity, technology, and civilization. in the last 20 years and what do you think/hope you see in the next 20?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not a lie and they are planning for expanding nuclear but building much cheaper solar so maybe they won't need that nuclear. They are hedging their bet and they are still a major source of goods other countries like the US don't/won't produce so their energy needs will be greater than other countries for awhile. As countries transition from producers to consumers they also reduce energy needs and that is playing out n the US: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14291</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Using a Solarium porch to reduce heating costs and keep your Generator and Batts warm</TITLE>

    <TEXT> #8203; [Solarium porch by Solarcabin](https://preview.redd.it/hgrsb5t9kkr51.jpg?width=373 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=092fc9b75dbed43e429d7035320d9125b478810c) Picked up my plastic to enclose my porch since it is already getting cold here. I have done that every year since the first year I built the cabin because I needed a place to keep my genny and batts warm (when the batts were outside) and it really helped and also provides a wind break and keeps the drafts from coming in when I open the front door. Also protects my propane system and tools from snow and helps warm the cabin up in the day time and a nice place to hang out without being in the cold wind. I made some wood framing from old cedar fence boards to keep the plastic in place and use an old screen door covered in plastic for the door. Not air tight but brings that temp way up in the day time if the sun is shining at all. The solarium porch is probably the best $15 investment I make each year that reduces my expenses and makes winter here a lot more tolerable! Video of my solarium porch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh02b9nZRz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh02b9nZRz8)  #8203; NOTE: Don't run your genny in the solarium. I open the solarium door and roll it out so it exhausts outside.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THIS is NUScale: When NuScale releases it's energy consumption to heat produced ratio you let us know. They are just collecting funding from investors and have no plans to build until 2029. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuScale_Power "For now, NuScale's reactors exist mostly as computer models. But in an industrial area north of town here, the company has built a full-size mock-up of the upper portion of a reactor. Festooned with pipes, the 8-meter-tall gray cylinder isn't exactly small. It resembles the conning tower of a submarine, one that has somehow surfaced through the dusty ground. NuScale built it to see if workers could squeeze inside for inspections, says Ben Heald, a NuScale reactor designer. "It's a great marketing tool." Not everyone thinks NuScale will make the transition from mock-up to reality, however. Dozens of advanced reactor designs have come and gone. And even if NuScale and other startups succeed, the nuclear industry won't build enough plants quickly enough to matter in the fight against climate change, says Allison Macfarlane, a professor of public policy and geologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who chaired NRC from 2012 through 2014. "Nuclear does not do anything quickly," she says." https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/smaller-safer-cheaper-one-company-aims-reinvent-nuclear-reactor-and-save-warming-planet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At least the third time this nonsense has been posted in 2 days. SPARC is a scam: THIS is NUScale: When NuScale releases it's energy consumption to heat produced ratio you let us know. They are just collecting funding from investors and have no plans to build until 2029. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuScale\_Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuScale_Power) "For now, NuScale's reactors exist mostly as computer models. But in an industrial area north of town here, the company has built a full-size mock-up of the upper portion of a reactor. Festooned with pipes, the 8-meter-tall gray cylinder isn't exactly small. It resembles the conning tower of a submarine, one that has somehow surfaced through the dusty ground. NuScale built it to see if workers could squeeze inside for inspections, says Ben Heald, a NuScale reactor designer. "It's a great marketing tool." Not everyone thinks NuScale will make the transition from mock-up to reality, however. Dozens of advanced reactor designs have come and gone. And even if NuScale and other startups succeed, the nuclear industry won't build enough plants quickly enough to matter in the fight against climate change, says Allison Macfarlane, a professor of public policy and geologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who chaired NRC from 2012 through 2014. "Nuclear does not do anything quickly," she says."

    <TEXT>From the article: " For those of you new to the topic, all this should give nightmares to natural gas stakeholders because, right now, natural gas (aka fossil gas) is the primary source of hydrogen for fuel. Hydrogen also plays a huge role in the global agriculture and food processing sectors among other applications. Growth in the global hydrogen market would be a lifeline for natural gas stakeholders now that the power generation market is beginning to slip from their grasp, except not if the sustainable hydrogen trend catches hold. Nailing down a more sustainable source for hydrogen would be a big plus for renewable energy investors while creating many new green jobs, just in time for [**the green COVID-19 recovery**](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/06/02/game-over-for-coal-renewable-energy-best-bet-for-covid-19-recovery/) to gather momentum. Renewable hydrogen can be produced from landfill gas and other bio-based sources, but much of the R amp;D has focused on punching hydrogen out of plain old water, by applying an electrical current. The technical word for that is electrolysis. From a sustainability perspective, electrolysis makes no sense if your electricity is coming from the local coal or gas power plant. With the advent of low-cost renewable energy, the pieces fall into place."</TEXT>

At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/ End of discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Currently, worldwide, nuclear power generation produces 10,000m3 of high-level waste per year. Since we have established you can't do basic math that is 10,000 cubic meters per year. A cubic meter is a measure of volume. Cost for that waste in the US is now estimated at $38 billion dollars. That is 38 with 9 zeros after it. Give it up and go play your Minecraft.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SPARC is a scam: THIS is NUScale: When NuScale releases it's energy consumption to heat produced ratio you let us know. They are just collecting funding from investors and have no plans to build until 2029. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuScale_Power "For now, NuScale's reactors exist mostly as computer models. But in an industrial area north of town here, the company has built a full-size mock-up of the upper portion of a reactor. Festooned with pipes, the 8-meter-tall gray cylinder isn't exactly small. It resembles the conning tower of a submarine, one that has somehow surfaced through the dusty ground. NuScale built it to see if workers could squeeze inside for inspections, says Ben Heald, a NuScale reactor designer. "It's a great marketing tool." Not everyone thinks NuScale will make the transition from mock-up to reality, however. Dozens of advanced reactor designs have come and gone. And even if NuScale and other startups succeed, the nuclear industry won't build enough plants quickly enough to matter in the fight against climate change, says Allison Macfarlane, a professor of public policy and geologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who chaired NRC from 2012 through 2014. "Nuclear does not do anything quickly," she says." https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/smaller-safer-cheaper-one-company-aims-reinvent-nuclear-reactor-and-save-warming-planet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As of 2017, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 6.14 million tons (compared to 5.72 million tons in 2015). At the rate of consumption in 2017, these reserves are sufficient for slightly over 130 years of supply. There are 6,923 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven gas reserves in the world as of 2017. The world has proven reserves equivalent to 52.3 times its annual consumption. This means it has about 52 years of gas left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves). When will the sun die: Approximately 5 billion years When will the wind stop blowing? Do you see how ridiculous you are being now?</TEXT>

You can probably still remember your old addresses and phone numbers from many years ago but not what you had for breakfast yesterday. Music also has a mathematical basis so we tend to remember tunes much longer. Other memories we hold on to are usually related to some strong emotional reaction which triggered high levels of chemical reactions. Especially those that were traumatic in nature. The event can be so traumatic it may shut down that memory but still cause panic attacks and PTSD symptoms when a trigger sets off that reaction even without the person understanding why they react that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not going to debate your opinions: As of 2017, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 6.14 million tons (compared to 5.72 million tons in 2015). At the rate of consumption in 2017, these reserves are sufficient for slightly over 130 years of supply. There are 6,923 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven gas reserves in the world as of 2017. The world has proven reserves equivalent to 52.3 times its annual consumption. This means it has about 52 years of gas left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves). When will the sun die: Approximately 5 billion years When will the wind stop blowing?</TEXT>

It can replace NG and fossil fuels for many purposes and can be converted back in to electricity if needed. Countries are planning to over build their solar and wind and use that excess for green hydrogen and the rush is on to get that infrastructure in place. The US just made a huge deal with Denmark for green hydrogen technology that will replace NG.

Solar panels are better constructed and should hold up outside. They come as a 2 pack and each has it's own solar panel and a remote that lets you set the light mode and set the lights timer. Pretty cool and about as much light as a 40 watt lightbulb. Good for off gridders, camping, chicken coop light or an emergency light.

In addition to the efficient engines, this is due to the low weight: the car weighs only 360 kg without batteries. This is over half as light as comparable cars. In addition, the car only needs sixty kilos of batteries as opposed to hundreds of kilos for other electric cars. PLASTIC FROM THE OCEAN Luca #8217;s chassis consists of a unique sandwich panel developed by the students in collaboration with several companies. The exterior is made of flax fibers combined with plastic which was fished from the ocean. Although this was often in the ocean for several years and consists of different types of plastic, it is able to give the chassis sufficient strength when combined with the natural fibers. The core of the material is made of recycled PET bottles. PET can be recycled no more than ten times, so its lifespan can be greatly extended by using it in a car. After all, ten cars last longer than ten plastic bottles. THE RESIDUES ARE ALSO INCLUDED However, the implementation of waste doesn #8217;t stop there. The car #8217;s body, for example, is made of recycled ABS, a hard plastic used in many consumer products such as toys, televisions and kitchen products. The car gets its yellow color from a wrap  #8211; a colored film  #8211; instead of paint. This film can also be removed without leaving any residue. This leaves pure plastic and makes the final recycling process a lot easier. The side and rear windows are also made of recycled material. The recycling process immediately gives the windows a luxurious black tint, so sustainability can be anything but boring. A lot of waste has also been used in the interior. For example, Luca has two very comfortable custom-made chairs, the cushions of which consist of a combination of coconut hair and horsehair. The fabric around them is made of recycled PET but feels and looks like suede. The center console consists, among other things, of a plastic additive from household waste. In addition, there are even residual materials from Luca #8217;s own production process: small pieces of flax with the plastic from the ocean are compressed into stylish, useful plates."  #8203; What a fantastic design and this is what we should be doing with all car manufacturing and that think looks sharp as hell!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most homeless people that live on the streets are survivors and very resilient if they just have a place they can set up camp and not be hassled by cops for their lifestyle choices. We need KOA like camps that have a shower, access to clothes washing, trash disposal, community gardening, internet and access to public transportation and let them set up camps using tents or tiny houses and they will have a permanent address and most will hold jobs and get the help for addictions and other problems they may have. I have been promoting this sort of set up and designing off grid tiny houses for this purpose for many years and many Vets and homeless people now have their own off grid houses. Not all homeless people want to be tied to a house and all the hassle and payments that go with a house and they want that freedom to move when they feel the need.</TEXT>

The fact is many homeless have jobs and and support themselves and are willing to work and contribute to society when given the chance. Society stigmatizes these people and prevents them from establishing a safe way to live and then degrades and blame them when they do. The fact is there are a lot of addicts and criminals living in very nice homes wearing nice clothes and driving nice cars and many work in politics and law enforcement!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nuclear costs 10x as much as solar per KW, takes billions in upfront costs, takes many years to build and has expensive security and waste issues and uses a finite material many countries do not have. Where our uranium-comes-from: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"According to a 2015 assessment by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 564,708 people were homeless on a given night in the United States. At a minimum, 140,000 or 25 percent of these people were seriously mentally ill, and 250,000 or 45 percent had any mental illness." https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202015%20assessment,percent%20had%20any%20mental%20illness. "The National Coalition for the Homeless has found that 38% of homeless people are alcohol dependent, and 26% are dependent on other harmful chemicals." "In the United States, almost half of adults (46.4 percent) will experience a mental illness during their lifetime. 5 percent of adults (18 or older) experience a mental illness in any one year, equivalent to 43.8 million people."  #8220;Drug use is on the rise in this country and 23.5 million Americans are addicted to alcohol and drugs. That's approximately one in every 10 Americans over the age of 12  #8211; roughly equal to the entire population of Texas. " As you can see mental illness and addictions is also high among people that are not homeless. I have no problem wit a UBI to help people but it is unfair to claim the homeless are mostly mentally ill and addicts when that just is not true. They like all people with mental illness and addictions need help and should receive that help. All it takes to become homeless is to lose a job, go to jail for any crime, get thrown out by your parents or not be able to pay your bills for any reason or lose your home to a natural or man made disaster. Homelessness happens to many good people every single day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had to look it up and not my area of expertize so maybe someone can explain it better: On Earth, the speed of sound at sea level  #8212; assuming an air temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius)  #8212; is 761.2 mph (1,225 km/h). Because gas molecules move more slowly at colder temperatures, that slows the speed of sound; sound moves faster through warmer air. Sound waves travel at the speed of sound cs. For ordinary sound waves in air, this amounts to around 300 metres per second. In contrast, for the plasma sound waves in the early universe, the speed of sound amounts to roughly 60% of the speed of light. "It's impossible to measure the speed of sound in every single material in existence, but scientists have now managed to pin down an upper limit based on fundamental constants, the universal parameters by which we understand the physics of the Universe. That speed limit, according to the new calculations, is 36 kilometres per second (22 miles per second). That's about twice the speed of sound travelling through diamond." Sound waves travel faster the more dense a material is: the more rigid the medium - the more difficult it is to compress - the faster sound travels." So when we say speed of sound it should be ... through a specific material or matter.</TEXT>

Otherwise it has no effect on reducing CO2 and pollution and is just hurting the most vulnerable while protecting the polluters.

However, all batts even new with nothing connected lose power over time and there is loss from the wiring, controller, inverter and just aging of the battery.

    <TEXT>Shutting down a reactor for any reason is VERY expensive and increases risk of a nuclear hazard. It isn't like you flip a switch and turn off a nuclear reaction. This is another reason that nuclear is not a good choice for sustainable energy and the fact it is 10X more expensive than solar and wind and uses a finite material that is running out and most countries don't have. As of 2017, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 6.14 million tons (compared to 5.72 million tons in 2015). At the rate of consumption in 2017, these reserves are sufficient for slightly over 130 years of supply. There are 6,923 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven gas reserves in the world as of 2017. The world has proven reserves equivalent to 52.3 times its annual consumption. This means it has about 52 years of gas left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves). "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis."

    <TEXT>True, but I have found even the most staunch denier will change when it becomes personal and their own livelihood, home and family is in danger. I live in a very red state in the oil patch and resistance has been very high here to accepting climate science and choosing renewables. Until the oil price collapsed and they lost their jobs and fires burned a lot of their homes to the ground and droughts dried up their farms. Not nearly as much resistance now to installing renewable energy that creates jobs and powers their homes for free and EV cars they can charge at home. It is too bad it takes a disaster to change their minds but that is what it takes with stubborn people and while they may still not admit it is climate change and capitalism causing their probs they do like saving money and having their own power systems and safer homes.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Truck battery solar charger for winter project</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-12 15:40:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>We get cold winters hare and -20 is not unusual and because I only drive my truck to town a couple days a week to resupply that cold will zap the battery right down and I have had to start and run the truck every day and sometimes twice a day to keep the battery charged up. That uses gas and not good to start a cold engine with a low battery. So, I have some small solar panels in storage and an old PM controller. I am going to rig up a roof mount panel on my truck camper shell with an angle bracket to keep my truck battery recharged in winter so maybe I won't have to start it every day. I have a 20 watt I bought for my big truck that has kept that battery charged and they make them but I already have the equipment so I should be able to rig up my own and save some money. I have one like this for the big truck: [https://amzn.to/2IcXMwX #65279;](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F2IcXMwX amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa2xSVnZWcWxYRzNpZ0xNRThqeXo1QmU4ejJqUXxBQ3Jtc0trTGhNcnpjUkl6NnpwMXZmMVhRbVA0Tl9HWEo5Vld4ajBLczMtVzVuZ05QLU5XbHJocXhldlRGT2VIc0FLdHdRcThHV1I1N1VvRFdONDllMjl2WlNZbXRzaUhVUDBuWEJNNFVxeGJlMi1laTVLRXRZUQ%3D%3D amp;event=backstage_event)</TEXT>

With about 470 million followers, scholars consider Buddhism one of the major world religions. Sounds like you are not very familiar with Buddhist beliefs that also form their economic system. The most fundamental feature of Buddhist Economics is seeing "people interdependent with one another and with Nature..." That system has been used and still in use by many Buddhist communities.

Capitalism by design is based on making a profit which leads to a few corporations owning most of what people need to survive and creates a greed motive that is harmful to the most vulnerable.

    <TEXT>From the article: " Solar output is expected to lead a surge in renewable power supply in the next 10 years, the International Energy Agency said, with renewables seen accounting for 80 percent of growth in global electricity generation under current conditions. In its annual World Energy Outlook published on Tuesday, the IEA said in its central scenario  #8211; which reflects policy intentions and targets already announced  #8211; renewables are expected to overtake coal as the primary means of producing electricity by 2025. The combined share of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind in global generation will rise to almost 30 percent in 2030 from 8 percent in 2019, it said, with solar PV capacity growing by an average 12 percent a year.  #8220;I see solar becoming the new king of the world #8217;s electricity markets, #8221; IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.  #8220;Based on today #8217;s policy settings, it is on track to set new records for deployment every year after 2022. #8221; Maturing technology and government support mechanisms have cut financing costs for major solar PV projects, the IEA said, helping to bring down output costs overall. Solar PV is now cheaper than new coal- or gas-fired power plants in most countries, it said. Power generation from renewables is the only significant source of energy that continued to grow in 2020, the Paris-based agency added."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Capitalism does not encourage equality and it encourages profiting at the expense of others. Definition "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state." " does that really matter if everyone has enough means to live? " There is is the main problem of capitalism as it encourages over use of resources so that those with the least money to afford it are the ones most hurt by capitalism. Those with the most can horde resources the majority needs. We have seen that inequality play out throughout history. This applies mostly to resources like energy, water, housing, and services like health care that all people need to survive but also applies to the environment, climate change and pollution that is always much more devastating to the poor. Regulated capitalism can work if the government is not corrupted by corporate interests but that is rarely the case and that system is inherently designed to create corruption and greed at the expense of the most vulnerable.</TEXT>

With about 470 million followers, scholars consider Buddhism one of the major world religions. Sounds like you are not very familiar with Buddhist beliefs that also form their economic system.

    <TEXT>PUBLISHED AUGUST 25, 2020 https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/08/why-renewables-arent-reason-california-blackouts/ Energy Storage Projects to Replace Three Natural Gas Power Plants in California https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/energy-storage-projects-to-replace-three-natural-gas-power-plants-in-california Continuing on a successful year of ramping up storage procurement to increase the reliability of the state #8217;s electricity system, Clean Power Alliance (CPA) advanced a new solar + storage project and added new storage to an already contracted solar project. The CPA Board of Directors approved the Daggett Solar  amp; Storage project and an amended Arlington Solar project Thursday. The two projects will add 123 MW of renewable energy capacity and a combined 193.5 MW of battery storage to CPA #8217;s long-term portfolio, generating enough electricity to power 50,000 Southern California homes, with 100% carbon-free energy. https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2020/10/clean-power-alliance-advances-solar-storage-projects-southern-california/ Your opinions do not match reality.</TEXT>

It was big oil and coal that suppressed their own scientists findings on climate warming caused by their industry and suppress allowing solar and wind energy to be used through political pressure. Sure, there are some honorably companies working towards making the environment better including taking responsibility but they are still the small minority of business owners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT># Discussion on the Future of r/Futurology and new Climate Change Mega Thread . It appears a small group has complained enough about Climate Change articles on Futurology that the Mods have moved to make them all go to a Mega Thread, which as all of you know means they won't get read and discussed which pleases the science deniers greatly. Considering many of the top posts that get the most upvotes and discussion are on climate change it seems that is a popular Futurology topic that Futurology followers are interested in. I am sure there are a few people that don't want that topic discussed at all because it makes that subject real and much harder for them to deny. They will love that you are pushing all the climate change articles in to a corner where they won't be read or responded to. I think this is a bad decision and should be reconsidered and no one is forced to read any article here and if you don't like a certain person's posting then that is what the block feature is for. I would look at who is doing the complaining about those articles carefully to see if they have an agenda and if they ever post anything on Futurology worth reading. So, here is a chance to make your feelings on the subject of the future of [r/futorology](https://www.reddit.com/r/futorology/) known and how you feel topics should be handled and hopefully the mods will listen.

    <TEXT>It isn't talked about because it isn't even remotely true. Nuclear costs 10x as much as solar per KW, takes billions in upfront costs, takes many years to build and has expensive security and waste issues and uses a finite material many countries do not have. As of 2017, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 6.14 million tons (compared to 5.72 million tons in 2015). At the rate of consumption in 2017, these reserves are sufficient for slightly over 130 years of supply. There are 6,923 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven gas reserves in the world as of 2017. The world has proven reserves equivalent to 52.3 times its annual consumption. This means it has about 52 years of gas left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves). When will the sun die: Approximately 5 billion years When will the wind stop blowing? Where our uranium-comes-from: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/</TEXT>

They are at the top because they are popular and an issue people want to learn about and discuss that effects all of our future including yours and your families. No one forces you to read anything on Reddit and you can block posters if you don't like a topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Short answer is money. Any project that would make a significant difference costs a lot and would also push out the dirty fossil fuel industry that employs a lot of people and has political and economic power. That is changing as solar and wind is cheaper than all other sources of energy and is ramping up rapidly and hydrogen looks to be getting ready to boom and will replace NG for many uses. It is all in how fast we can do it and if we can get the fossil fuel shills out of government or regulated so they can't interfere in what needs to be done.</TEXT>

And it #8217;s happening faster than anyone could have imagined just a few decades ago. Northern Siberia and the Canadian Arctic are now warming three times faster than the rest of the world. In the past decade, Arctic temperatures have increased by nearly 1C. If greenhouse gas emissions stay on the same trajectory, we can expect the north to have warmed by 4C year-round by the middle of the century.</TEXT>

    <TEXT># New poll on climate change: Denial is out, alarm is in. [https://grist.org/climate/new-polling-on-climate-change-denial-is-out-alarm-is-in/](https://grist.org/climate/new-polling-on-climate-change-denial-is-out-alarm-is-in/) Only 18 percent of Americans are now dismissive or doubtful about the science of climate change and the need for action. More than half (54 percent) think the opposite, falling into the  #8220;alarmed #8221; or  #8220;concerned #8221; categories. This sea change in American attitudes represents a triumph for climate scientists and communicators who have been trying to convey the truth about climate change. But the growth of climate alarm presents another challenge for researchers and policymakers: communicating what action to address climate change could look like. The climate alarmed don #8217;t need more information about what climate change is; they #8217;ve already reached the fundamental conclusions:  #8220;It #8217;s real, it #8217;s us, and it #8217;s bad, #8221; as Leiserowitz put it.  #8220;Now, they need to know what we can do. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you are being manipulated by a small group of climate science deniers abusing the report button because they don't want anyone to read, discuss and learn about man made climate change. It is probably the most important issue that will effect our and our kids and grandkids future in many ways and is fitting with the topic and spirit of futurology. It is obviously a very popular topic here just from the number of upvotes and discussions that happen on those topics and I think you will regret kowtowing to the science deniers and will lose many Futurology followers by treating it this way. Look at the history of the few people complaining and you will see they have an agenda and most never post anything to Futurology and have a history of attacking any post about climate change and renewable energy.

And most will never prove themselves and are just in it for that Fed seed and investor money. 3- " NuScale is building its modular SMR on the DOE #8217;s Idaho Falls site and has a contract to sell the electricity to a consortium of rural electric cooperatives, two of which recently dropped out because of spiraling cost projections. " They actually are NOT building and have only a model and and no plans to build anything until 2029 and tat wil only be a low power test that will consume more energy that it produces.

Elevating and floodproofing buildings alone could cost the four counties $4.4 billion by 2070. Other coastal protections, like adding sand to beaches and building berms, could cost $18.2 billion by 2070. But the price of not doing anything is much steeper. Raising and floodproofing buildings could avoid $18 billion in losses. Armoring the coast could avoid $38 billion in losses. Either batch of solutions could also create tens of thousands of jobs throughout the region.</TEXT>

I don't buy your story for a minute and your non answer about posting anything of interest to Futurology pretty much says it all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely taxes are a form of regulating the economy as any economist would tell you and that is our means of production that pays for those General Welfare programs you and our family all benefit from every day. There is no "free market" in the US and we have REGULATED COMMERCE as mandated by the commerce clause: The clause states that the United States Congress shall have power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." "Power to Regulate" and you will not find "free market", "capitalism" or "corporations" anywhere in our constitution because that is not mandated.</TEXT>

Today you can get panels for less than a dollar a watt. EVs are not as expensive as people think and you can find them for around $25K now and comparable to a new gas car. Several new models coming out in that range next year and EVs will boom when they do.</TEXT>

Such measures would also soak up more than 465 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to a new report released today. Protecting 30% of the priority areas identified in the study, together with protecting ecosystems still in their natural form, would reduce carbon emissions equivalent to 49% of all the carbon that has built up in our atmosphere over the last two centuries. Some 27 researchers from 12 countries contributed to the report, which assesses forests, grasslands, shrublands, wetlands and arid ecosystems.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you have a link to any examples or studies of that happening? I spend a lot of time on social networks that have a lot of RW deniers on them and I have not really seen them use that tactic. More are likely to use very old articles claiming scientists said there would be an ice age or pointing at NASA data they don't understand to claim it supports their opinions. ADDED: Since you haven't responded I would suggest the exact opposite is more likely and it would be a tactic of the RW deniers to go around claiming any "doomism" article about climate is actually coming from RW deniers as they want to create doubt and stop people from trusting news sources and scientists. That doesn't work with anyone that actually looks at the sources of information and knows what sources are reliable. The reality is deniers are losing and have lost that battle and very few people deny the science of man made climate change. They may make excuses or just say they don't care or pretend it isn't happening but it is obvious now that it is and will get much worse. I am not a fan of the doomsday headlines and I would prefer articles about positive actions we can take and technology that addresses the problem but we still need to make people aware of how bad this will be if we don't act now and not wait for theoretical energy or some miracle to save us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the article " The plant includes a system that concentrates sunlight in order to heat air to a high-enough temperature that is then used to drive the microturbine to produce electricity. The heated airflow can also be directed to a thermal storage system and then transferred back into the microturbines up to 20 hours at night when solar irradiance is not available. As a result, the uniquely designed 247Solar plant can supply power over extended periods of time and reduce fuel consumption by up to 90%."  #8203; So, sounds like they are creating a super heated thermal chimney effect to drive an air turbine to produce energy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a big difference in the doomsayers like the r/collapse nuts that promote the idea nothing we do will matter so why try and articles from scientists that explain the actual harm and damage to the environment from man made climate change we are already seeing. To call those doomsayer articles is ridiculous and this is reality: https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14082020/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-climate-change https://www.axios.com/great-barrier-reef-lost-half-corals-australia-b0071feb-b774-4264-927e-ad5328b47196.html So, I recommend you read those articles and look for the sources before assuming any article that has a terrifying headline is from RW doommsayers trying to undermine the science. My posts and profile speak for themselves and that is why people trust the articles I link to and I also post articles on renewable energy and new technology and individual responsibility here every day. I think moving the climate change articles to this mega post just accomplished what the climate science deniers wanted to end those being seen in feeds and discussed so people can learn about that science and what we can do and is being done. I hope the Mods on Futurology will reconsider but I won't let it stop me from helping people get that info in whatever way I can.</TEXT>

It is produced from excess solar and wind and can also be used for heating homes, making steel and converted back in to electricity as needed. Batteries work fine for average motor vehicles that don't have weight issues and can be recharged at home.

So as the heat affects them further and further, while at the other end, rich people sit in air-conditioned offices, then it will definitely be a reason for increased inequality. #8221; At both the population and the individual levels, heat and poverty are something of an ouroboros, a cycle that wealthy people and countries perpetuate via emissions, but themselves are able to escape by way of air-conditioning, indoor work, and social and geographic mobility.

    <TEXT>As the post states: Hydrogen is better for big rigs, fleet vehicles, cargo vessels and eventually commercial jets and can also be used to make steel and for other industries using Diesel or NG. It will likely not replace batts for general use vehicles so you can stop worrying about that. Musk announced a batt big rig 4 years ago and so far nothing. "The goal of M2FCT is to enable widespread commercialization of fuel cells for heavy-duty transportation, with a 2030 goal of systems that have a 25,000-hour lifetime, or 1 million miles for long-haul trucks, by working with industry, academia, and national labs. With input from industry, DOE has also set cost and efficiency requirements. Fuel cells could be especially conducive to heavy-duty and fleet operations in part because of the refueling infrastructure, Weber said. Fueling stations could be concentrated at fewer locations than would be needed for passenger vehicles, such as at the bus depot or along frequently traveled long-haul truck corridors. Besides the environmental benefits, trucks powered by fuel cells would provide several benefits for the operator, such as more power, the ability to carry more cargo since hydrogen is a lighter fuel system than diesel, and the ability to bypass rules against idling, since the trucks would have zero emissions." https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2020/10/08/coming-down-the-pike-long-haul-trucks-powered-by-hydrogen-fuel-cells/</TEXT>

It can be trucked, piped or produced on site from solar and wind power. It is not likely to compete with batts for general purpose use cars so you can stop worrying about that.

There are also lots of small businesses and independent businesses that wll be able to get that from commercial hydrogen producers.

    <TITLE>Power for the Campin' Wagon and backup power for the Cabin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 15:50:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thinking about a power system for the Campin' Wagon that will also back up my cabin system. I have 400 watts of solar and three 125AH Vmax tank batts which usually provides all the power I need for the cabin unless I get 3 days of really low sunlight. Unfortunately that happens quite frequently here in winter. I really don't want to add more batts or panels to that system as it is maxing out the controller and I don't like adding new batts to old batt banks. So, I think I will get another 100 watt Renogy pane and a 100AH Renogy batt and set that up for the Wagon with a PWM controller and small inverter I have. That will only be used for running a 12 volt fridge/freezer for storing extra meat and when I go camping in summer but in winter I can run a 110 volt cord from that in to the cabin for back up power on bleary days. Renogy has this RV system with panel and batt for $310 which is cheaper than what I would pay just for another Vmax 125AH battery and would give me at least an extra day of back up power: https://amzn.to/3496pBs [Renogy 100AH batt and 100 watt panel](https://preview.redd.it/vkyakj16fot51.png?width=563 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=2b1cdb7255e96dc49b6ace00504c83db2feabf4a) That should be plenty for running that fridge and camping and if I need a back up for the cabin. Could also be used for recharging tools, jump starting vehicles and a few other purposes I have in mind. Basically it is an emergency remote power system on a trailer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Solar is 10X cheaper than nuclear just based on KW. "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/</TEXT>

Trees respond to the difference in temperature, precipitation and light by slowing photosynthesis. As the chlorophyll  #8212; the energy-producing compound that makes leaves green  #8212; breaks down, new chemical compounds emerge. Carotenoids, the same pigments in carrots and buttercups, make leaves appear orange, yellow and amber. Some tree species also produce anthocyanins, compounds [found in blueberries and grapes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613902/), giving leaves red, purple and burgundy tones. But wildly [multicolored](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057373) forests are under threat. Foreign pests and pathogens, arriving unnoticed in imported lumber or even packing materials, can alter whole landscapes in a short time, said [Howard Neufeld](https://biology.appstate.edu/directory/dr-howard-s-neufeld), a plant ecophysiologist at Appalachian State University.  #8220;They can take out trees, and if other trees come in that are different colors, that can have a dramatic effect, #8221; he said.

    <TEXT>I think AI and supercomputers has advanced all technology and scientific discoveries so that is the biggest advancement . What is really propelling us though is the threats we now face from man made climate change, air and water pollution, droughts, floods, wildfires and new viruses and diseases. That is increasing stress everywhere and driving mass migration and causing panic and intensifying the risk of wars and violence over resources. We have all the technology for renewable energy we need right now to stop and possibly reverse that damage but governments tied to corporate interests are standing in the way so we will have to do it for ourselves if you want real positive change in society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You will get lots of different opinions but I am an old fart and if it isn't pull start, 6Hp or less and designed for off and on road use it isn't a mini-bike IMO. That is also the designation for most mini-bike racing events. That doesn't mean I don't like other bike styles and I have seen some really cool custom small street bikes and choppers and pit bikes are a lot of fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is why you see a lot of 49CC mopeds and scooters. They get under the registration requirement. That is a different definition of a bike though and mopeds and scooters are not generally considered mini-bikes. I remember when they changed laws so to make mopeds have a peddle assist to fit that legal category. Most states no longer require that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"scientific community overwhelming recommends nuclear in addition to solar and wind." No, actually they don't. Nuclear costs 10x as much as solar per KW, takes billions in upfront costs, takes many years to build and has expensive security and waste issues and uses a finite material many countries do not have. Where our uranium-comes-from: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php "Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis by Lazard, a leading financial advisory and asset management firm. Their findings suggest that the cost per kilowatt (KW) for utility-scale solar is less than $1,000, while the comparable cost per KW for nuclear power is between $6,500 and $12,250. At present estimates, the Vogtle nuclear plant will cost about $10,300 per KW, near the top of Lazard #8217;s range. This means nuclear power is nearly 10 times more expensive to build than utility-scale solar on a cost per KW basis." https://earth911.com/business-policy/solar-vs-nuclear-best-carbon-free-power/ "Peak periods tend to be in the morning during winter months (when lots of heating is occurring) and in the afternoon during summer months (lots of cooling)."

    <TEXT>Got the plastic on the solarium porch finished just in time before the wind kicked up. I was curious so I did some temperature readings to see how much heat that adds to the cabin and it is about 60 degrees outside and a toasty 82 degrees in the solarium and with my front cabin door open it is a nice 71 degrees with no other heat source. I could probably even increase that with that 20 watt solar fan to pull more heat inside. The solarium porch also protects my genny, tools and propane system and keeps the genny warm in winter so it always starts right up. I figure it saves me $200-$300 in winter heating cost and a lot of aggravation. Best $15 and 1 hour project I do every winter!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>" The reactors are being built by Portland, Oregon,-based NuScale Power. " THIS is NUScale: When NuScale releases it's energy consumption to heat produced ratio you let us know. They are just collecting funding from investors and have no plans to build until 2029. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuScale\_Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuScale_Power) "For now, NuScale's reactors exist mostly as computer models. But in an industrial area north of town here, the company has built a full-size mock-up of the upper portion of a reactor. Festooned with pipes, the 8-meter-tall gray cylinder isn't exactly small. It resembles the conning tower of a submarine, one that has somehow surfaced through the dusty ground. NuScale built it to see if workers could squeeze inside for inspections, says Ben Heald, a NuScale reactor designer. "It's a great marketing tool." Not everyone thinks NuScale will make the transition from mock-up to reality, however. Dozens of advanced reactor designs have come and gone. And even if NuScale and other startups succeed, the nuclear industry won't build enough plants quickly enough to matter in the fight against climate change, says Allison Macfarlane, a professor of public policy and geologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who chaired NRC from 2012 through 2014. "Nuclear does not do anything quickly," she says."

If you don't have kids then do it because it is a great investment: " The [study](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/research-centres/centre-climate-finance-investment/research/energy-investing-exploring-risk-and-return-the-capital-markets/) found renewables investments in Germany and France yielded returns of 178.2% over a five year period, compared with -20.7% for fossil fuel investments. In the U.K., also over five years, [investments in green energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2019/12/12/as-britain-votes-investors-look-to-renewables-as-the-best-bet/#2ecae69ca142) generated returns of 75.4% compared to just 8.8% for fossil fuels. In the U.S., renewables yielded 200.3% returns versus 97.2% for fossil fuels.
