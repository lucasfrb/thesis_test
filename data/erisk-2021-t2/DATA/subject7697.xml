    <TEXT>I used it as a bit of a go-anywhere device, media streaming (Plex, BBC, other sources) and light work with the Office applications, so being able to use them is a must. I also liked to use the mini-HDMI output when I was at hotels or for presentations. So something with an optional keyboard is ideal, and decent battery life. I also love using OneNote so if there is something with good stylus support then that would be great (thus my tendency to lean towards the Surface 3). I haven't heard anything about the Surface 4 so I'm not even sure if it will be released or if MS are sticking with Pro's. It definitely needs to be portable/light, I don't want to be lugging around a second laptop (Work supplies one also). I dont have to work with Photoshop/matlab though so I dont think it needs to be anything superpowered. Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I mean the surface 3 came out over a year ago (just), I would have hoped for soome news at BUILD or something... I do wonder if given its age I would be better off going for a Surface Pro 3 (if I could find a reasonable price) as I would want the pen/keyboard anyway so its questionable as to if the Surface 3 will last as well, My RT was a champ I'd had it for almost 4 years!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! I'm inclined to agree to an extent, it is quite complicated but I do have a decent organisation in place to keep track of it all, this is more just me second guessing myself I think? These are all my accounts and all in my name yes, and the idea is absolutely just to maximise the interest, I want to make the money work for me rather than just have it sitting in a 0 interest account. I'm a higher rate tax payer with some but by no means all all of these accounts filled, and looking to save for a house with my girlfriend. If you can suggest a more account-efficient structure I'm happy to hear it though so please do tell! I'm happy to move things around or explore other suggestions :) Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I mean in terms of time its actually not to bad, I rarely need to log in to the other accounts because all the standing orders come from my Santander one and I have text alerts set up on them all. That said the initial set up was a pain, I think I ended up drawing a flow chart to get it all straight! The other investment options you mentioned I'm significantly less clear on, I don't really understand having money in somewhere other than a bank.. do you have examples? I have a pension provided by my company and make a personal contribution to it also (though I forget the percentage)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is interesting, I was under the impression that you could open second accounts in a few of these banks... can I not then? The ISA I had left because I was really unsure what to do with it, I don't think I can contribute to a Stocks and Shares ISA this tax year with the Help to Buy can I? As I mentioned to /u/barejokez I'm really not clear with anything outside of savings in a traditional bank account (ISA and H2B ISA were just about easy enough to understand!) I'm definitely not looking to fill these rapidly, this is more of a 5 year plan. Basically when I am paid and afterI look to see if all of my savings accounts are filled, and if they are I open another one on the list.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks I'll add that to my list of options! Yes that's exactly what I'm doing, TSB just got filled and Santander is too the Halifax one has no interest so no need to do so, and the Tesco one is on its way to being, but was more opened in order to have the direct debits for Halifax sorted. I just have to work out now which ones I can actually have multiples of (seems I haven't got the correct information in some cases) and work out my next step as a result. I'm not using the cashback on Santander to any great degree, but the reason for that is that my girlfriend and I have a joint account for household bills, for which we are using the NatWest Rewards account instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The minimum monthly deposits are added and removed either say day or within 24 hours and this is enough to fulfil the requirements. Even the interest only calculates based on the amount at close of business at the end of the calendar month as I understand it, but to be clear the accounts I have have the maximum amount I can have in them all the time in order to take advantage of the interest rate. Hope that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly have no clue about investing really. I'm only 26 and have managed to accrue somewhere in the region of 40K of savings, its not what I would call a huge amount but I'd acknowledge I've done quite well for my age. I just don't think investing is the right way to go currently, especially as I am renting and looking to buy which means I'd need a little more liquid assets in my head. That said with the 'Brexit' things are a little more up in the air right now so I'm not going to do anything until I know whats happening in that area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm very late to the party, sorry about that. But i do have something for this. I went on holiday with a few friends snowboarding in France, first time doing it out of an indoor centre. The night before we'd had a disgustingly early flight in and I hadn't slept a wink the whole journey there. Needless to say on the first morning out I was still pretty tired. We did a few greens and blues, no reds as i didnt want to over cook it. Now the thing some people don't realise about snowboarding is how painful it can be leaning on an 'edge' for an extended period of time. If you have a long straight you end up putting a lot of continued pressure on your toe edge or heel edge. It can be quite tiring but the alternative is losing speed and having to walk, which is tiring. So after a fair few small falls and a lot of walking it was starting to get dark, so we decided to head back to the hotel... Honestly that's all I remember. The next thing I knew was washing up in a hospital bed, asking where I was and what happened. All my friends told me was to look at my phone. This is what it said: * you had an accident * you have had an MRI, without contrast * yes you have set the bed up like this * you have spoken to your parents, they are on their way * yes you are a 'plonker' Apparently I had been asking the same 5 questions every five minutes and then forgetting the answers. Eventually they got fed up and wrote it down for me. One of my friends eventually stated recording our conversation. I have no memory of it and it is one of the most terrifying things to listen to because of it. If turns out what happened was on the last run in I fell over and smacked my head. Got back up and meet up with my friends, who then realised I was not quite alright and couldn't remember certain things. My friends being my friends however didn't tell me this straight away. Instead they decided to have some fun... So they told me: * I jumped off of a gondola when it stopped * I fell off of a gondonla to save some school children * I fell off of a gondola saving some nuns I don't remember any of this either but apparently I always believed them up to the point where they told me I saved someone... Which says something I guess. I'm fine now still don't remember that day really, and do wonder sometimes if my short term memory is what it used to be. TL;DR: fell over snowboarding, lost a day of my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The pharmaceutical products Ventolin and Flixotide (traditionally your blue and brown/red inhalers). Traditionally when a drugs 20 year patent runs out you get a sudden drop in market costs as generic manufacturers make the same drug at a lower cost (see paracetamol, ibuprofen). However Ventolin and Flixotide have been so successful that they have all but wiped out the generic forms of the drug and are still one of the manufacturers largest earners.</TEXT>

Yes the blue/brown (or red) configuration was always taught to me as a kid with asthma as "Brown keeps the asthma down, and blue helps the air through" lol. Other small interesting fact, Ventolin inhaler has a specific colour called, surprise, surprise, Ventolin blue. :)</TEXT>

I'd say its very early stage to be trying to get on a trial. But, assuming you are US based you could try and get in contact with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute which will supposedly be taking part and see if they would consider your mother. I am not a doctor or working on this compound so wouldn't be able to provide any sort of assurances I'm afraid. Best of luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And now that I have my collection feels all the more complete! I'd been looking at a Junker for a long time but had been struggling to find the right one, then whilst shopping yesterday this watch was pointed out to me, and I had to have it! This is going to be my dress/occasional work day watch. My everyday is a Citizen which I have posted about previously (AT9070-51L) and I have a more casual Citizen CA0080-03E which I put a NATO strap on and tend to use on the weekends. [Link to my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/48m7h0/citizen_updated_my_every_day_watch/). This Certina is a DS Podium Automatic, my first automatic, and also has the exhibition caseback, which looks awesome! I'll post some more pictures of the new watch and the rest of my collection if people are interested at some point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 6 watches which I use for all walks of life, a lot of them have been given as presents over the years, and others I bought myself! First up is the classic Casio F-91W, a present from my granparents when I was about 10, and something I still use for trips to the gym, its been through a lot! So much so that the strap finally gave out on me a couple of years back. I replaced it with this fabric NATO which I think matches well. For a long time my everyday watch was my Citizen red arrows CA0080-03E, it was a present for my 21st and originally came on a black leather strap with red trim (which I still have just in case) I moved it to this RAF officers NATO strap, its now my regular weekend watch. The Timberland watch was a present given to me at 13 and I'd hardly worn it to this day. Recently I was thinking about a Timex Weekender but remembered this, added a Brown strap, which my collection didn't have at the time, and it's growing on me. Its a simple watch for travelling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Cont.) My Casio World Time Data bank (in case you can't tell) Is a beater/sports watch and one I bought for this specifically. Its been with me for years and I haven't changed the battery yet! The Citizen AT9070-51L, a present from my girlfriend, is my everyday work watch, its beefy and looks great, and the radio control feature makes it perfect for business travel. I do miss a chronograph but its so damned reliable I forgive it of that small omission. Lastly, and most recent to my collection, is the Certina DS Podium Automatic. My first and only Automatic, its smart, sleek and (whilst some might disagree) looks great as a smart/suit watch. It was an impulse buy to myself and I love its simplicity compared to my usual watches. So that's it! Let me know what you guys think/any suggestions for my next watch!</TEXT>

I tried pressing stop to kill any hanging code but no joy.

I did try and use the 'compile VBA project' button but nothing seemed to happen. I'll keep it in mind if the error happens again though. Thanks for your help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel your pain friend. I've settled down with SquareHome launcher to simulate the Live tile experience and it works moderately well, looks nice too. As for some of the other functions I liked and missed, I turned to Tasker for a Cortana-style read my texts when connected to bluetooth, and added apps like Popup Widget and Expand Snap which gave me some nice quick shortcuts to various funcitons. Combining these three apps does let you keep a nice WP-themed homescreen with lots of nice extra functionalities. Tip: combine SquareHome's long-click action with Popup widget and any shortcuts you can to trigger some slick events. My phone is probably now more functional than my old 1020 used to be (though I admittedly still miss that camera), and outside of the odd crash or bug that means I need to restart the phone, I'm quite happy. Keeping an eye on the WP ecosystem in case I can ever hop back over but not holding my breath.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks I'll look into the Scout. From what I've seen so far (and i'm pretty new to it too) Z-wave in NA uses a different frequency to that in the EU (I presume due to licensing), and also just plain availability. There is a lot more choice of systems in the US compared to the UK, combine that with the frequency difference and it's a little confusing if you start mixing and matching things!</TEXT>

If I can get it working consistently on my existing devices then I'll buy a couple switches and a z-wave dongle and keep going. So far its been ok but it's definitely more of a time sink...

I don't think it's worth much monetarily but it's very sentimental to me as I always remember him wearing it when I saw him. You can see from the picture that it's been well loved, it's a little scratched and dirty but I intend to get it cleaned or at least go over it with some lemon juice and a cotton bud. If anyone can tell me anything about this model I'd be really grateful. There is a choice on the back M7606.722 but searching that online hadn't yielded much unfortunately.

    <TEXT>I've got a fair few Tradfri bulbs and definitely rate them. Tradfri uses their own network (ZigBee, same as Phillips Hue) and won't be affected by your Wifi going down like LIFX would. It's also worth noting that, depending on what you want to do you don't NEED a hub for the Tradfri's. If you're happy with just lightbulbs connected to switches then just buy those. If you want timers to automate items, then you will need the hub. As a slight aside, I have Tradfri, and a home server on which I am running Home Assistant. It's a little complex to set up but with this system I can actually have IFTTT functionality with my Tradfri devices using the Webhooks channel. Hope that helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been in your shoes so let me save you some trouble. If you want to find Z wave compatible items check out vesternet.com, you'll notice the prices on Z wave bulbs aren't great unfortunately. That said if you are looking for cost effective I would go with ikea tradfri as others have suggested. It's a good balance between cost and functionality. I've seen others suggest you use home assisstant, this is actually my setup, a server with a Z wave stick, Ikea tradfri lights and homeassistant on my server to tie the two together. It's a fair amount of work to set up but it would give you the best of both worlds. Hope that helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to be clear, as it might not have been. Tradfri is NOT Z-wave Compatible, they use ZigBee. My suggestion of Tradfri was separate because relative to Z-Wave they are so much cheaper, and if one was to add a Home Automation server (running [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)) then the options for compatibility are very broad. Since you are asking if the bulbs will "work with anything" though. What are you actually wanting to do? If you give me some ideas of what you want me to do maybe I can suggest a better route.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, a bit of background first. You can't just buy a Z-Wave bulb, z-wave stick, plug it into a computer and expect it to be plug and play. Smart home systems which do not call out to an external server (see, Wifi bulbs, plugs etc) need a Hub located on the local network. For some this is Samsung SmartThings, Phillips Hue, Fibaro etc, what these do is read and control devices according to preset criteria or user input. In the absence of a Hub like this, some people opt to have a computer do the processing. This is what Home Assistant (among others) does. You can take your Z-Stick, plug it into a computer or Rasberry Pi, install Home Assistant, and it will detect and allow you to control your lightbulb, and whatever else you buy. I only have experience with Home Assistant, so can't talk to the others, but if you were to go with Home Assistant: If you have a Windows PC, with a Z-Stick connected, install Home Assistant, set it up and it will find your Z-Wave bulb and let you control it. I can't promise it is simple, Home Assistant is actually quite complex, but the effort required is worth it because of how expandible it is. People will also suggest not using Windows with Home Assistant, I have a Windows PC running a Virtual Machine (Ubuntu) and Home Assistant installed within that. Checkout: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X27eVvuqwnY * /r/homeassistant * https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/windows/ There are plenty of step by step guides that will talk you through how to do it and the community is active in helping to troubleshoot. If this is all a bit more effort than you wanted to invest, but you don't want to spend too much money. I'd suggest returning the Z-Stick and buying a Tradfri set (cheaper), or SmartThings set (more expensive but has Z-Wave Compatibility, so would work with your Z-Wave bulb). Hope that helps but let me know if you have any other questions.</TEXT>

If you have the time I'd reccomend going for a Rassbery Pi or Ubuntu VM on your Windows machine, and folllowing the instructions for a Linux install. but otherwise I get the frustration. Hopefully it'll get easier sooner rather than later, with companies like Amazon and Google slowy getting into Home Automation more and more there should be an increased demand for a simple system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not OP but I too make a damn good potato soup if I say so myself. here's what you need. * 3-4 decent size baking potatoes * 2 Leeks * Vegetable Bouillon * Soy Sauce * Worcestershire Sauce Peel and cut your potatoes into smalll chunks, so specific size needed but the smaller they are the quicker they are cooked. Cut the leeks into thin slices. Throw both items into a large pot, put about 2 tablespoons of bouillon powder in, and fill it around 3/4 full with boiling water. stir well to make sure the bouillon mixes properly. Put the lid on and, once boiling, simmer for around 1 hour. After the hour, check the potato is soft by trying to pick it up with a fork or knife. The pieces should slide off the utensil unassisted or break apart with minimal effort. Take pan off the heat, and apply a hand blender to the whole thing until the potato and leeks are pulsed into a thick soup. If it is too thick for you its fine to add a bit more boiling water to thin the mixture a bit. Add Soy and Worcestershire Sauces to taste, serve and enjoy. Should make about four hearty bowls worth, and it freezes really well to keep for later. For different flavour use a stock from a previous meal e.g.: Chicken or beef juices from a roast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, can I clarify this point? You can use Ikea Dimmers to control the Hue bulbs with the Ikea gateway. Does this mean I can buy and pair Hue bulbs to the Ikea gateway and they will function in the app/Home Assistant as if they were native Ikea bulbs? I've been trying to find out if this works for AGES but only find eveidence that the reverse works - Ikea Bulbs on Hue Bridge. If I can buy some Hue lightbulbs for my bedroom and hook them up to my existing Ikea Tradfri setup that would be a gamechanger! Thanks</TEXT>

But sometimes the CC isn't being used to watch stuff, just the TV or Xbox, so I was hoping it could be used as a trigger still. I'm using Nmap tracker for phones to track IP addresses, if I just add the IP of the CC to the list to track would that do it do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so a couple of points to address here: Firstly, I've had the same issue with service data I'm typing being randomly cleared. This happens less frequently in Chrome, but as you say typing it elsewhere and pasting is a perfectly fine workaround. To your question "Where is the data showing what lights it is turning on?", that is normally displayed within the same automation, i've pasted one of mine below as an example, which turns certain lights off at midnight. - action: - alias: light data: entity_id: light.dining_room_lamp_1 service: light.turn_off - alias: light data: entity_id: light.lounge_lamp_1 service: light.turn_off alias: Downstairs Lights Off (Midnight) id: '1502129399237' trigger: - at: 00:00:01 platform: time condition: [] Have you checked that this automation actually does what you think it does? Finally, adding a new entity is easiest managed with a second action. Again, here is the same automation I showed you above, in the automation editor: https://i.imgur.com/RnLk6hO.png Alternatively you could put them in a group and then set the entity_id to turn on as group.MY_GROUP_NAME Hope that helps.</TEXT>

The only thing I think may speed things up would be putting the lights you want to trigger into a group, check out the bruh automation youtube videos for this as they are really great ways to learn. What I was trying to ascertain though was how do you actually turn on the theatre lights? Are these hue bulbs or similar? Are you triggering from a switch that you can connect to home assistant instead?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will place a recommendation for Tradfri. They're cheaper than Hue and have been pretty seamless in my house, 0 downtime related to them in the 5 months or so I've had them. I even bought 2 Hue bulbs, which you can connect to the tradfri gateway, simply to experiment, and because they go slightly dimmer than the tradfri ones (better for bedroom lights in the morning). My only gripe right now is that they don't work natively with Google Home, and you cannot use the app unless you are on the same network as them. However it's a minor issue because Home Assistant does allow both of these things!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;not sure if they are already on the latest software or now, how can I check this? Simply by trying to connect them.  gt; do I also need the tradfri controller? Yes, you do, but a controller includes the motion sensors, so you already have 2.  gt; how do I then go about getting the motion sensors to work with the lights? You first pair the bulbs to the hue hub, then pair the sensors to the hub (reset them then use the pairing button while searching for new devices on the Hue hub), and then pair the sensors to the bulbs (the normal way). There are plently of YouTube guides on this if you search around. Best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Learn to search the subreddit, all of these questions are asked practically daily, or people are talking about their setups which show that these things do work. Tradfri and Apple HomeKit work together, including the motion sensors yes, but Homekit requires all devices to be the same brand. So if you are going this way you cannot mix and match hue/tradfri bulbs, you must either use all Hue bulbs and hub or all Ikea bulbs and hub. Tradfri bulbs come in both white and colour depending on what they sell in your region.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are Long Term Safety Extensions or Compassionate Use programs which some studies run to provide supplies to the patients outside of the requirements of a study. However this is down to the Investigator/Sponsor rather than the Patient, who can only withdraw consent. As another mentioned if it is a post-marketing study there may be the ability to buy the product outside of the study, but if it is not approved yet then the only way to get it is through the study at the sponsors/investigators approval.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got an HTC 10 right now and its running pretty well, but I'm getting phantom-taps from what I presume is a few drops on the screen, no visible breaks thankfully but it can get a bit annoying when typing. I've been looking at the recent offerings but I can't seem to find a phone that covers all of these: * Top range camera, OIS, good low light performance, pro mode etc * Headphone Jack and SD Card slot * Front Mounted Fingerprint sensor * Glove Mode - I cannot see any confirmation of this on ANY new phone and it makes me sad Right now I'm leaning towards the following: * Nokia 8 or 7+ * Samsung S9 (begrudgingly as I don't like the rear fingerprint sensor or lack of glove mode, or what I presume will be poor update support, but I cannot deny that camera) * LG V30S * Honor View 10 (though I'm unsure about EMUI) My Hope is that the next HTC, or Nokia 9/8 Pro will fill all the requirements I have, but does anyone know of something else available/coming soon which I should look for. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm yeah I'm sort of leaning that way, if the N9 loses the jack I'll be sad. At least with the S9 I have Iris scanner which means I could still almost ignore the rear FS if I chose to. Do you know any phones with confirmed glove mode? the only ones I've been able to find have been Sony's</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not aware of putting Alexa in rooms and them being able to work out contextually which light you want to turn off. I use google home instead of Alexa, but have rooms set up with GH speakers and lights in various rooms, but still need to use the qualifier of 'bedroom' to turn off my bedroom lights even if I'm talking to the GH in the bedroom. As I understand you can name lights, and group them into rooms which allows you to say turn on/off the X lights, which will turn on/off all lights in that group, that is all that groups are used for though. Sadly I don't believe you can have some contextual responses to which light just by saying 'light', at least not without some clever work on the backend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in a similar situation looking for a keypad, right now I'm playing with 2 options: https://thanksmister.com/android-mqtt-alarm-panel/ This allows you to use an android device (in my case a spare Fire Tablet) to create a keypad, which connects to Home Assistant via MQTT. My second thought is a little complicated but I am thinking of buying a Z wave switch with multiple buttons, and creating some sort of input code with a mix of boolean switches and automations in Home Assistant. I.e.: if you have a 4 button switch for example: 1. Turns on switch 2 and off switch 3 2. Turns on switch 1 and 2 3. Turns on switch 4 and off switch 3 4. Turns on switch 3 This would essentially finction as a keycode as you would design a puzzle which would have 1 (or as few as possible) codes to prevent someone guessing. Hope that helps a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have ST so i'm not in a position to help much there. But I was under the impression that you can set up MQTT on ST and Homeassistant and talk to any devices using the ST box as a middle man? This would mean you have to keep the ST box setup which may not be what you are looking for though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>from this: https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/02/09/Smarter-Smart-Things-with-MQTT-and-Home-Assistant/  gt; How it works  gt;  gt; HTTP Endpoint: There are really only 2 ways to communicate with the SmartThings hub that we could find. The easiest approach is to create a RESTful SmartApp authenticated with OAuth that provides state changes via HTTP directly. This approach is pretty straightforward to implement, but it requires communication with the SmartThings cloud service, and can #8217;t be done entirely on your LAN. We hoped to keep all communication internal, and came up with a second approach.  gt;  gt; Custom Device Type: SmartThings custom device types allow developers to define handlers for HTTP events received directly over the local network by the SmartThings hub. so basically, yes it can all be handled locally rather than using the ST cloud as long as you set it up as a custom device type.</TEXT>

But you get a reasonable number of security guards or other staff recording footage from CCTV on phones and uploading to youtube and/or liveleak. So it's not a completely niaive assumption</TEXT>

Step 1: set up home assistant * https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/ Step 2: Add tradfri lights to home assistant * https://home-assistant.io/components/tradfri/ Step 3: Make home assistant available online using DuckDNS and Letsencrypt * https://home-assistant.io/components/duckdns/ * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIvQ8x_iTNE Step 4: Set up Google Assistant to work with home assistant * https://home-assistant.io/components/google_assistant/ This guy has the best set of guides in my opinion but there are plenty of others if you search https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLecVrux63S6aYiErxdiy4w</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100% of the time when something is up for renewal, be it insurance, or a utility/bill of some sort, I go straight to a comparison site, and check out the cheapest quotes (or the cheapest quote from a company I recognise depending on what I'm looking for). pretty much every year I've been able to get a reduction in what I'm paying monthly. Be it Internet, Insurance, Gas and Electricity, or Phone bills. I definitely cannot reccomend a 5-15 minute google for comparitive quotes for anything and everything - what do you have to lose :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep I've been burned before by some no name insurance providers too. Now I'll happily pay  #163;20 more in order to have the peace of mind of an easier company to work with. Good to know too that some small insurance companies are underwritten by/subsidiaries of other larger providers, I feel generally fine to go with these too.</TEXT>
