    <TEXT>I talked to my doctor, and he just gave me a new medication. I'm really disappointed in the quality of care. No advice on how to take it or where I need to be weaned off my old one. Is this really good enough? The issue is I don't know what else there is anyone can do to help me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a writer and I want to write a character who happens to be mute. What are some storylines that pisses you off, or tropes that feel ableist? I'm assuming the "oh my god they CAN talk!" is one of them, things like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know whether its just because I have autism, but factual inaccuracies to me comes across as not caring about your work. To me, passion is perfection, and every time I've ever written about something I wasn't knowledgeable about, I read until I *was* knowledgeable about it - or at least knowledgeable to write correct information. I'm personally not sure whether other authors feel this way, but if I'm including it in my narrative, I've put thought into it. A lack of research is a lack of effort, and that revolts me too much to continue reading. I can't stand lazy authors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But thats a massive difference. If I can see the effort made to the point where you'd literally have to have a degree to understand the subject matter, then I don't mind. Most authors "miss" things, which is fine. That's a huge difference from being lazy and just putting out misinformation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get that my perfection is an issue, haha. Perhaps its just my autism that means even one error can break my immersion and soil a story for me. Usually I can tell if its artistic license, and while contrived, I will grit my teeth and read on nevertheless, and usually enjoy it. My bar for suspending disbelief is probably substantially higher than the standard reader, which means while I'm more critical, I also enjoy far less. So that reflects on me more than the author. I agree that making choices isn't lazy, but going for the easy route by putting in what you *think* you know and not even checking with a Google - now that's lazy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's interesting! I've never been able to pick my battles though. I'd love if authors put this sort of information at the end of the book - as soon as I snipe misinformation, I *do* go to check if there's a logical reason for it. With the example of historical fiction, I guess it depends if you're writing for the common man, or history buffs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sometimes it might be slick to mention like "UGH I ran out of estrogen and my prescriptions running late" or "Did you finally get your bottom surgey booked?" or something like that. bringing up trans-only experiences in conversation, like the pain of shaving amab hair. sisters joke about things, so don't be afraid of lighthearted teasing. if transphobia isnt the relevant topic, then yes please avoid transphobia sometimes we really just want to hear about trans women existing in peace, so thanks for being considerate about that. ill be excited to see your story develop!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you still have a functioning penis, dont be afraid of handjobs, oral and PIV sex. most cis girls are still designed to enjoy PIV, so even if they're lesbians, they should know you're trans and be comfortable with that when things get hot and heavy in a relationship. of course, you can do other things too, like getting pegged by your parter if you arent comfortable (in a dysphoric sense) using your penis. stimulating her is always a great option too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i think that could be bisexual! and its okay if you arent much interested in cis girls. just be careful that you dont come off as a fetishiser or a chaser - someone who only dates trans women because the idea of transsexuality is erotic to them. but on the other hand im sure a lot of trans women would be pleased that youd find them sexually appealing haha. its about getting the balance right. dont worry too much about it, only you and your partner should care about your sexuality tbh</TEXT>

    <TEXT>definitely not repulsed by women but petrified at the idea of sex with women. i guess thinking about it, because im so scared of women, it doesnt really leave me an opportunity to fantasise about anything else. so its not like i enjoy thinking about it, i just feel quite neutral when thinking about men. that gives me a lot to think about, so thank you</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What would happen to semen on the brain?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-12 18:47:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Imagine you've just performed a craniotomy on someome and their brain is right there, all the protective layers peeled back (so no dura, arachnoid or pia mater) and you ejaculated semen on top of the brain. Or delicately placed semen on top with care so the force of ejaculation wasn't like a gunshot. Then you put the skull flap back. What would happen? Would it rot? Get reabsorbed? Cause disease (the semen has no STD though) ? Cause a pulmonary embolism??? Would the person wake up and behave differently? These are questions that need answering!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While the brain has no touch receptors, you can still stimulate it with electricity to cause varying effects. Usually tiny, replicating movemen (twitchy limbs), sensing feeling around the body and limiting speech. So I guess that's the closest ting to a brain feeling things. Unfortunately(?) semen can't stimulate the brain at all. I wonder if it has a conductive effect if you used an electrical probe on the grain with the semen still there...?</TEXT>
