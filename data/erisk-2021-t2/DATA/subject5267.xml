    <TITLE>[Help] Question about dog behavior</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-11 00:51:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>My family has two dogs. Medium sized dogs who are just great. But when "Dad" is eating the dogs lay near him and if my children (5yo and 2yo) go near "Dad" they try to nip/bit them, usually in the face area. It's the only time they are like that and I'm wondering what this means. Is this a sign of something more or, like "Dad" says, just they way they are. Oh the dogs are around 4yo and 2yo. Both are mixed herding dogs. Any advice, knowledge would be helpful. If this doesn't belong here please direct me to another subreddit (I'm a couple days new to reddit thank you),</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How my turned me, a metal-loving music fan into a kpop lover</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-16 15:31:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I grew up listening to anything metal/rock. I spent 20 years listening to the same 50 songs over and over and as time went on I would stop turning on the radio. I was getting tired of the same songs on rotation for years upon years. When she started to listen to kpop I rolled my eyes wouldn't even give it a chance. As time went on I would find that kpop songs were stuck in my head and I found it annoying. You're not going to hit me with that Du-dudu-du-du. I'm too much of a man for that. That's when she started explaining things like "bias's" to me and she forced me to pick one. I chose Wendy from Red Velvet cause, cute. About two weeks later I was singing Ice Cream Cake in my head. Then it was TT by Twice. Then I heard Black Pink and I was like wow. The beats are amazing. The way the songs were arranged was amazing. But what I noticed is, I had a new love of music. I have never heard anything like that before and was finding myself reading about the bands online and looking up songs. I must have listened to CLC - I like it 500 times in two weeks. I was hooked. But I was too ashamed to play it in the car with the windows down for fear of looking like less of a man. That soon changed. Look, I'm not good at saying what I feel the correct way. I know this post is in terrible format but the point is that now I love kpop. I love the fans. I love the fact that I can enjoy music again and have this huge catalog of new songs (new to me anyway) that I can enjoy. I no longer get annoyed by whats on the radio because it's now usually a kpop song I haven't heard. I roll down the windows and blast Very, very, very. I crank up CLC - No. I love me some Twice. And I've started to like boy bands in kpop because they don't mess around. They just shred those lyrics. So, thank you kpop for giving me my love of music back. Thank you for welcoming a metal loving guy into the fold. And thank you, Wendy for being awesome. I'm now just a music lover not a metal/rock lover. I found out that no matter how old I am I still can learn something new. And I'm excited for US tours of bands because WENDY SIGN MY SHIRT!! And mostly, thank you to my wonderful wife for opening my eyes and sharing something she loves with her husband. It's helped our relationship grow because we have more to share with each other. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Welcome to Tennessee</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-16 15:52:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>ADVICE FOR ANYONE MOVING TO TENNESSEE: 1. Save all bacon grease. You will be instructed later how to use it. 2. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four wheel drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is what they live for. 3. Remember: "Y'all" is singular. "All y'all" is plural. "All y'all's" is plural possessive. 4. Get used to the phrase "It's not the heat, it's the humidity". And the collateral phrase "You call this hot? Wait'll August." 5. Don't tell us how you did it up there. Nobody cares. 6. If you think it's too hot, don't worry. It'll cool down-in December. 7. A Mercedes-Benz is not a status symbol, a Chevy, Dodge, or Ford is. 8. If someone says they're "fixin" to do something, that doesn't mean anything's broken. 9. The value of a parking space is not determined by the distance to the door, but the availability of shade. 10. If you see a slower moving vehicle on a two lane road pull onto the shoulder that is called "courtesy". 11. BBQ is a food group. It does NOT mean grilling burgers and hot dogs outdoors. 12. Yes, weddings, funerals, and divorces must take into account for UT Football games. 13. Everything is better with Ranch dressing. 14. DO NOT honk your horn at us to be obnoxious, we will sit there until we die. 15. We pull over and stop for emergency vehicles to pass. 16. We pull over for funeral processions, turn our music off and men remove hats or caps. Some people put their hand over their heart. 17. "Bless your Heart" is a nice way of saying you're an idiot. 18. No mater what kind : sprite, coke, pepsi, mtn dew, it isn't called soda or pop. Its all called coke. 19. If you don't like the weather in Tennessee, wait 15 minutes, it will change.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why I love rain</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-18 00:31:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love the rain. One of the things I love the most, and there is no equal not even close is the sound of rain on fallen leaves. When it's October/November and you're out walking around in a hoodie and it's raining and cold enough to see your breath, it's silent everywhere and all you can hear are your footsteps and the sound of the rain hitting all the leaves on the ground. I stop, close my eyes turn my face to the sky and let the rain hit my face. The sound. The way you feel each drop as it strips the warmth from your face cooling you off. Then I smile and start walking again. Kick a pile of leaves and laugh. In those moments I feel so alive. So happy. I wish those moments could last forever but the fact they don't is what makes them so special. That is why I love the rain.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Warming up a car before driving it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-20 14:17:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I go start my car in the morning or anytime really I notice a difference in the way it sounds compared to leaving it sit warming up for about 4 minutes. It sounds like it idle's faster and sometimes the belt starts squealing (only if it's been raining, foggy or just really cold). But after a few minutes it clams the idle down and the belt is silent. Should I avoid driving until all that happens? Info: 2012 Dodge Journey SXT 3.6L 140,000 miles and as of yesterday the only thing with the car is I need new front brakes. There are zero leaks, drips, anything. My goal is to get the most life out of my car. Thank you for reading this.</TEXT>

Can anyone tell me what it's called and if you have a link to it please share. It's driving me crazy and using google to try and find it is lol not working at all. I've been trying for day.

    <DATE>2019-03-24 14:40:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have owned cats my whole life. I have never let my cats outside. I always get them fixed and never ever declaw as I find it inhumane. I spoil my cats and have never had a cat ever try to get outside. Actually, every cat I've ever owned has been afraid to go near the door when it opens. The two cats I have now were rescues. I went to the animal shelter and they had the cage marked and when I found out it meant they were getting near the date to be "put down" I took them both cause nope. You're not killing kittens bro. I found out that they were both found in the engine of a truck in a supermarket parking lot. When I got them they were "just old enough to be given away" from what I was told by the shelter. Well here it is, one year later, roughly, and the one cat is always trying to make a break for the door. If you open the sliding glass door you better have a leg in the way. I was always raised to use a squirt bottle to get cats to stop doing things, like one shot in the behind area. It doesn't seem to work and I'm afraid of making my cat basically hate me for it. My wife thinks it's mean to not let her go outside if she wants to. Any advice would be great. Thank you for your time</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-12 02:21:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm around 30 days new to reddit and I love posting things. Over and over. Some people give me crap about it so my question is: Is it acceptable in the reddit universe to be a mass poster? Like three posts to the same sub in under 20 mins or is that frowned on? Also if I'm doing something that is frowned upon please let me know how to better be in line with what other users find acceptable so I can learn. Thank you for your time</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-27 19:34:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just took over a defunct subreddit and am working on getting it going and I don't know what to do with the rules. I said I didn't want many rules and my wife was like "what about racist posts" and I never thought about that. I guess what I'm saying is what are some rules that are almost a must to not have a toxic mess on my hands. It's a subreddit for anything funny without the rules of some of the other subs for memes and stuff. But I guess since I don't think toxic I don't foresee it coming. If you don't mind helping with this info thank you. Either way thank you for your time. Any advice is welcome even if off this topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What performance in any film showed 100% dedication to the role they were playing which left no doubt that they were the person they were playing? Art can be subjective but as long as you believed it and felt it then it belongs here. I will take time to try and look up what is listed. Please be kind to each other in the comments as we all look for something different and performances can effect us in different ways.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best Chinese restaurant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-26 17:57:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I already asked about buffet places in another post and in this one I am looking for Chinese food. What is the hands down best Chinese food you can get in Fort Wayne? Please comment on the egg rolls if you have had them at the place you recommend. Also is there any really good Chinese buffet places? I haven't found a good Chinese buffet place basically ever. Thank you guys. I might be posting other questions about other types of food later. I'm writing them down so we can try them. We pretty much have sworn off McDonald's, Burger King and Taco Bell completely. If we eat "fast food" it's Culver's or Panera. We just moved to Indiana at the end of February and into Fort Wayne city limits in the middle of March so we have a lot of learning to do. We do have two children that would be going with us to these places, 5yo and 3yo so please keep that in mind with your recommendations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They can remove money out of my account when I debit within seconds. But if you are due a refund on your card, even when the place sends it to the bank within minutes, it can still take up to 5 days to get the money on your card. So if it's all automated why in the heck does it take so long to get money back?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Using more than one Ethernet switch with Gig service</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-06 23:30:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have Xfinity Gig service which means my router has only two Ethernet ports and I can only use one because the other one is used by the service. I got a gig Ethernet switch (8 port) and I don't lose any speed with it. I average around 960 mbps when wired and about (450 mbps wireless). So I want to run a 25' cat 6 into my room and hook it into a second 8 port gig Ethernet switch and wire an Xbox One X and a couple other things in there. Will I lose speed using a second switch? Or can I just stack these puppies up. Like put a two port splitter and run one into my sons room then run the other one into my room, ect? Anything I can learn off of this is a win so thanks for your help. Getting an answer is good but learning why you got that answer is better.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Instant Pot owner here and I'm overwhelmed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-30 23:34:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got an Instant Pot Duo60 V3 today as a gift for Christmas (is this a good model?). I started reading and looking at things on the internet and holy crap I'm overwhelmed. I guess I just wanted to ask for tips. I don't care what the tip is either. Just, if you own one and have for a while and it's something you think a new person needs to know, hook me up with it. I'll read every comment. Also if you have any ideas on what I should cook first (I'm really really wanting chili or chili mac) let me know. Just to let you know I got my first ever slow cooker back in Feb so I'm really new to slow cooking and this. I'm sorry this is vague but honestly, I'm just that overwhelmed. Thank you for your time and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm around a year new into kpop (new as in started seeking out songs on my own not just what my wife played). It took a while honestly to admit I even liked it. I'm not trying to be offensive or sexist but as a guy I wouldn't admit I liked it. Well it's amazing being an adult and finding a whole new type of music to listen to. I have been listening to the same songs for years over and over. You can only handle so much Jefferson Airplane before music starts to just suck. Kpop literally caused me to continue to even care about music. Then I discovered Mina in Twice. Then I heard Wendy from Red Velvet sing. Hooked. Instantly. It's really simple at this point. I love metal. I love Slipknot, like a lot. But I swear to everything that is holy, don't you dare speak ill of Wendy. She is Ultimate Bias and Mina is the Bias wrecker. Talent is talent and it comes in many forms. I'm excited for this sub to learn new music. Bring it on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not asking if you agree with the choice. I'm asking do you think that Indiana will join our neighbors and legalize Marijuana, and I assume tax the living heck out of it? EDIT: You should stop in and read the comment section. It's worth it just for that. It's like one of those political shows where they just yell random stuff at each other. There are people down there doing algebra (idk why) but it's fun to read.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just learned how much the people of Indiana are passionate about where they live and I love it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-09 22:39:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I moved to Northern Indiana in Feb of last year. There are a couple things I've noticed that shocked me. I asked a questions on the Indy subreddit about marijuana legalization chances in Indiana in 2020 and the comment section turned into a very amazing list of people who want to only see their state "mature" I guess. Because they love their state. Here what I've noticed myself: 1. People in public are actually very polite and or they mind their own business 2. The "bad" or "below average" schools are staffed with people who work their butts off to make due with what they have because they are there for the children and funding in Indiana for schools is embarrassing 3. There is a LOT of work here. Again THERE IS A VERY LARGE VOLUME OF JOBS IN THIS STATE THAT PAY GREAT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK. And the majority of workers I've been in contact with here are (mostly) amazing. 4. The people of Indiana care about what is happening in it crime wise. They want a safe state for families, a vacation destination, industry and education. That's not a lot to ask for There is more but those are the 4 that stick out to me the most. I grew up in Alaska and moved here Tennessee. What is weird is the south is probably the rudest place I've ever lived. It sucks down there. But here it is the polar opposite. I really love it here. My wife and I are completely shocked with that to be honest. I love the people (expect you drivers, fyi there are other people on the road than you. Also red light means stop) of Indiana and I'm glad I'm raising my family here. I'm sorry we're close to Ohio but that's another story.</TEXT>

But if I need to use the bathroom I hide. Even in my own home. I #8217;ll skip using it for a couple hours if everyone is watching tv. If it #8217;s too quiet. I get tossed into a mild panic because I have to poop. Why and how in the hell do I get over this? I #8217;m a grown man this is annoying af. Oh and like maybe one person has ever heard me fart.

    <TITLE>Finally have birds at the bird feeder after almost three weeks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-19 20:41:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I found out that the major issue was, they couldn't see the food. Something I did not even think of. So i got a second bird feeder that was clear, hung it on the same pole and then threw some seed on the ground. It took about 48 hours with one bird here one bird there. Then I noticed the bush. They will hide in a bush near it for a day or so to check the area out. Open the garage they go away for a while. Now I open the garage they leave, but come back the moment I leave. Anyway, just thought I would post this here because my kids have been wanting to feed the birds and my cats are enjoying the view from the living room window. I love seeing the kids get excited to feed the animals. Maybe when it gets near spring I'll take the kids somewhere around town and have them help us pick up trash in a location. Just thinking that it might show them what littering does to the community. This town is great but does have a litter problem. A large one too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm looking for a story about a time when Americans were outnumbered by a lot and somehow either won or just survived. I'm not sure how else to explain it. Like a one or two guys held off an attack by X number of enemies or a group of X amount were faced against a Y amount and either won or was able to hold off the attack. Anything after WWII that either has a video about it or show or story. I just like reading about how our soldiers band together against the odds in battle. I'm watching a show in Snipers on AHC right now and a comment they made about how a guy with the sniper has the ability to repel an attack to protect his sniper and stuff like that blows my mind.  #8203; p.s. I'm not sure if this sub has mostly military persons in it but if it does: Thank you for what you do so I have the ability to live the way I do with my family.</TEXT>

Welp we know we will end up getting the new Xbox this year after it releases so my questions is, can we have two Xbox's with the same account logged in, and have them both run at that same time or do I need to just start my own account and deal with doing the games over again? I guess the end result would be her and I could maybe play together idk. Tips please</TEXT>

The guests on the show were outstanding. The acting was great. Casting Peter was one of great casting choices ever. But I can think back to so many times where my mother and I watched this together and it makes me see that this show was a huge part of my life. And each episode I see is a trip back in time to a simpler time when I was younger. I wouldn't trade that for anything</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to Walmart yesterday when I was high af and started to look for munchies. I ended up buying a Birdfeeder pole with four hooks on it and got for 4 birdfeeders and a little green cage that holds this gross block for woodpeckers. It's 8:43am and I'm sitting on the couch smoking a bowl watching the birds eat. So are my two cats that are sitting in the huge cat tree that is in front of the living room window. It's a beautiful morning. It's going to be 50 today. This is a great time to be alive as states start to legalize marijuana. Let's not forget our friends outside who struggle to eat in the winter. I also learned yesterday that I should put a large bowl of water on the ground for them. Smokers are generally a friendly group and friendships can be forged by the simple passing of a bowl or joint. So let's pass that on to our feathered friends outside. Or really any animal that needs help. Happy Sunday everyone. This hit's for you  #8203; EDIT: Whoa guys, that is a lot of awards. And honestly I don't deserve them. You all do. I made this post at around 8:30am EST and it is currently 6:50 EST and this post has kept me happy all day. I loved reading every single comment. I was having a great morning and you all made me have a great day. How can I have a bad day when I'm baked and reading some of the nicest things I've ever read. This comment thread shows how many wonderful, kind, and funny people are on this subreddit. I'm really happy to be part of it. Thank you all for making this an amazing day. This hit's for you. You too mods. You all are freaking awesome</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The other day I made a post on here about bird feeders and I read some of the nicest stuff I have seen in a while. Hundred or so people telling me stuff that literally made it one of the best days I've had in a while. Every now and then my phone would go off and it was a comment on that post saying something nice to me. Now I'm not really good at saying what I'm trying to say but either way, I hope every one of you have an amazing day today. I hope work is easy or school or anything you're doing. I hope the people you come into contact with today smile and if they don't, smile for them and try to pass on a positive vibe.

    <TEXT>It seems like every day is the same and life can be so boring and stressful. You hit up a bowl or J and you relax. But sometimes it helps to just tell someone that your day sucked. I usually have a crappy outlook on things but that's been changing recently. I hope the rest of your day goes great. And I hope tomorrow is twice as great to make up for today. No matter what remember that your opinion matters. Your mood matters. When no one else has your back people on here will listen. You got this. Now get ripped and eat something bad for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say honestly, South Anchorage. There are plenty of safe areas and you are closer to everything. If you commute from Eagle River you have to think of where you are going in Anchorage. Going from one end to the other can be a nasty commute. For the kids Anchorage would be fine too. Eagle River is nice but you find yourself needing to go to Wasilla or Anchorage for things which you would choose Anchorage over Wasilla so take out the middle part and just live in Anchorage. Also, welcome and we're so happy to have you and your family</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mass transit shouldn't add to traffic woes they are supposed to alleviate it. Indy has an issue of no give in many areas downtown that make it literally impossible to widen roads. This might sound stupid but with how Indy is set up it is a perfect place for elevated trains. Indy has so much potential in the outlining areas that I think if they put a plan in place to set it up in a 15 year period it could lead to growth in ares where it's stale and slow. The way Chicago does it is nice and the Detroit People Mover is really lame but a good idea if applied correctly. The people of Indy have put up with a lot over the years. The rising crime for one. Complete insanity on the roads is second.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. What it does is really next to nothing but make you cough. Even if it doesn't it can lead to more mucus production that drains. If do get a buzz from smoking, and I mean where you can feel in your head you're high but not completely, then that tells you, kinda, what kind of cold you have though. Not a head cold. Take a spoonful of Honey, drink tea or coffee and walk up and down a hallway. It will soften your cough and walking will either make your lungs feel better or you'll get the crap out faster making you feel better faster in the long run</TEXT>

I keep busy but outside. Hell I love nature when I'm high and love it when I'm sober. Other than that I literally keep in the forefront of my mind on why I am on the break.

And it's hard to make a post about it without seeming you are using it for karma. I didn't know a post about fucking toast was going to blow up but I'm glad it did. I have a LEAST 70 people telling me "Happy Cake Day" and no shit, it made my day. Who knew Reddit would make you feel more welcome than anyone in your real life. No joke, not even a little, joining reddit was amazing. Some people on here are the coolest people you'll ever have a conversation with. Thank you all for a badass year on Reddit.

    <TEXT>Growing up in Alaska, and just generally us living or From Alaska get asked this a lot. Here is my opinion. Go the the Matanuska Valley. Start in Palmer and head up to Anchorage and out towards Seward. Don't ever take a cruise. You can see the same things driving around Turnagain Pass. Alaska has the one thing other places don't, complete beauty, unmatched clean air and it all can be seen without going poor. Fiarbanks is beautiful but the trip TO Fairbanks is better. The trip going anywhere in Alaska is almost always better than the actual destination</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a lot of misinformation and public freaking the fuck out over Corona. I'm not here to discuss that, I'm here to say no matter what maybe take a little extra care. There are 1.5m ents that are part of this community and there are around 2k on right now. Imagine this world with 2k less stoners. I don't want to. Now imagine losing 1.5 million stoners. And stoners feel about other stoners how? As family. We meet outside, behind buildings, in cars, in the shower, in closets, in basements, in large gatherings and in intimate settings when it's cold outside or for a fellow stoners bday or just because you found out that King Size Snickers is $0.75 for 3 days only at Kroger so you load up the buddies. People are losing loved ones out there and that sucks. Let's make it so we don't lose anyone in this community. Let's blaze one for those that are at risk and remember those that pass even if we don't know them. You guys are awesome (you too mods, don't lick your keyboard). Stay safe. Don't be paranoid but don't be reckless. You're important and irreplaceable. It's 5:46am and I'm baked af. Have a safe day friends</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in a city of around 255k people. There is Costco and Sams Club, several Walmart's, Several Target's, I think 5 Kroger's, 4 Meijer's, ect. And there isn't a run on anything. At all. Nothing. No one is doing anything different and we have confirmed cases of a guy going to a home and garden show on Feb 27th and still no one cares. It's great</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is. You get super in flow while you're doing it. For me when I'm high that comes in waves. A good solid hour of building and then I need to stop for 10 minutes. When you do it at a kitchen table and don't have enough light from all directions it makes it suck when you stand up and since you've been looking 2' away for an hour you stand up and feel like you're 10' tall. Stopping every hour or so also helps you identify pieces easier. When you're looking in a color pile for a piece you can look at it and not see it if you've been doing a shit ton of small pieces. But bro, no kidding, what's good about it is that I have two young boys and I get more time with them when they pick out their own Lego sets. That bonding time is freaking amazing. I hope my kids remember those times when they grow up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doing it non stop it should take about 3 hours. But that isn't opening the bags, sorting the pieces out by color. Finding each piece. Double, triple checking. This set is one of the 3 hardest sets they make. That's why I got it. After you do that then you have the bags named #2. 5 of them. You cut them open, put the figures together, sort them, ect. Then on to batch #3, 4, 5, ect. So add that in you're at about 5 hours. Every now and then you need to step up and move around. Let your eyes adjust to something bigger than a Lego. That's 6 hours. Add smoking and carrot sticks dipped in ranch you have 9 hours  #8203; Edit: Forgot to include the 22 minutes I spent looking for a small piece in a box of extra Lego's, couldn't find one. So I made a hot ham and cheese. Then when I got back to building I noticed I already put that piece on. Instead of getting annoyed I told the piece it was dumb and I didn't need it anyway if I would have never found it. I knew I was lying to myself so I packed another bowl and told the piece I was sorry for snapping at it. Lego's bring out the devil in some people</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-13 17:18:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>We're mere weeks away from the fall of civilization. Don't worry though because Marijuana doesn't need civilization to grow. It only needs what is left of us. This took me about three bowls before I decided to type this so don't yell at me. Yell at society. So I propose this: We choose the best most honest mod on here to be our leader. After the coming apocalypse we'll need to make a new Government so we'll need someone who sounds really mellow when saying "Okay everyone, just chill out". We will need to set up a procedure to locate all surviving members of this sub so we can reconnect and help rebuild this world anew with peace and the love of the stoner. I went to the store today and people were buying more than they could ever need for a month of isolation which means people who just needed a normal amount of supplies like they buy each week, are left with none? Why not ensure everyone has something and maybe help those that can't get it. You know, humanity? You don't need 500 rolls of TP Martha. So that is why we should elect a new leader to help us reach the zen we all long for. A world built not in bricks or walls made of steel. No! We build this new world with leaves of green and lighters of all shapes and sizes. Holy shit I'm high. And my wife just woke up and is all like where the bowl at. I bought 11 bags of Combos. 6 bags of salad. Two bottles of Hidden Valley. And about 20 cups of fudge pudding. You're all welcome to some Combos after the apocalypse. Got bagel bites too. Is there a mod who is brave enough to lead us?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>YSK there is a fix for missing thumbnails on the iTunes store</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-14 09:51:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>This has been a known issue ever since Microsoft started putting iTunes on the Windows Store. The issue is that you cannot see album artwork on the iTunes store using the version of iTunes that Apple now directs you to download if your screen is set to 125% (as is recommended and is set to default) it will not show artwork. Dropping it to 100% sizing makes most things too small. The fix is to go to apple dot come forward slash iTunes, Scroll past the couple pictures and you will see a "Get it from Microsft" option. Ignore that and scroll slightly and you will see "See System Requirements". Under that you will see "LOOKING FOR OTHER VERSIONS". Click on "Windows" and you we have, once again, the iTunes version that works. No more syncing issues. If your phone has been messing up you might need to delete your iPhone backup (if it is stored in iTunes) and start from scratch. The Microsoft Store version it seems is somehow screwing up iPhones. I've been dealing with this issue for over 8 months and after all that this is all that can currently be done. The DPI scaling option doesn't always work. This is the only known fix right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isn't the largest bug in iTunes but it is a nasty little one. It starts when Apple tells users to delete their current version of iTunes and to download the version from the Microsoft store. That causes scaling issues. It causes iTunes store thumbnails to be grayed out. It has also been reported that if you are backing up your iPhone to your computer it can take up to 15 mins if you have over 25g worth of data on it. Basically the Microsoft version is trash. A lot of users are being notified that their backup is ruined. Mass battery draining with a healthy batter is how you know. If you get your battery tested and it "fails" but the batter is fine then it's your backup. Thanks Microsoft!</TEXT>

It's been making people happy as they drive around and look at the lights. Okay. I'm on board. Maybe I'll be called an idiot or whatever but I know my two young boys will be excited. And if one person drives by and sees them and they forget about all the drama in the world for just one minute, then I did my job. So I'll finish this bowl, then polish off another then get to work. We're all in this together and if something I did could make you happy for even a moment, then isn't that my job as a human? Isn't it all of our job? Keep safe out there trees family</TEXT>

During this time of social distancing maybe them driving around seeing the lights will cheer them up. Maybe not. I'm putting my lights up either way. I don't care if I look stupid or get laughed at.

    <TEXT>What? Okay this is fear mongering. There is nothing taxing on our grid. Nothing. There is less usage now in the spring compared to winter or summer. Again, assuming there is already a strain on the power grid is irresponsible and pointless. Not only is that information incorrect and can lead to further panic, it darn near is spreading false news which should be stamped out hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Misinformation like this is dangerous and should be deleted. This is just starting and it's not a joke. People are dying and we haven't seen anything in America yet compared to what we are going to see. This is the flu. This will be back again. This is something that most of the planet is concerned about. It's the selfish that hurt the ones trying to help. This post about the storms is great. It gets the word out which can save lives, (see Nashville and Cookville, TN tornados two weeks ago). Panic is a problem but informative posts like this are needed and welcomed. Oh and a reality check, which almost all adults know, there is no cure for any cold or flu. A flu shot is for a type of the flu not all flu. Then you have to make it which MINIMUM is 8 months with the entire planet chipping in. So no sir, there is nothing around the corner. There are 8 billion people on this planet. Not just you and your circle. I hope you and your family are safe even though I think your mindset is dangerous. I might disagree with you and I hope you see there are people dying. Stay safe out there and if you're feeling ill please contact a doctor. Watch the weather tonight</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are news stories about how people with depression are suffering in self isolation right now and they are taking to driving around and it seems like the lights are helping people right now. I have two young boys (6 and 3) and they don't really know what's going on but they know something is going wrong. My sons don't understand why we can't go places, why can't he go to school and be with his friends, why can't he go to Meijer, ect. Though my life I have had so much help from so many people. We all have. Well what good was it if we can't do the same? We are a community of stoners, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, ect and it's our job to do this. It's not about me or you it's all of us. And you know what, we got this. Because while we're locked down we have each other to talk to, share stories with, find help for older people or people at risk who can't get their own groceries or whatever. People are getting sick of talking about Corona but I live in the Midwest in a large city and it's falling apart out here. It isn't getting better, it's just starting. Maybe if my children see me trying to be a good person I'll raise two good people. Idk but It's worth a shot. I hope every single one of you have all you need and if not say so. Something like this reminds us all that we are a community of people not just people. I literally care for all of you because you're people. It doesn't take much to show someone who needs it that you care for them too. Stay safe and Remember What The Doorman Said, Feed Your Head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue is we have strong opinions and you can't anyone anything because we all know everything about what we need. That isn't exactly true, we've seen our team make some of the same dumb choices over and over. But they should have worked. There are a million reasons why teams that have great players end up sucking. Sometimes it's not that we're bad, it is that they are better. There is no shame in being beat. There is in always being beat. I'm 40. I have stood behind this team through 0-16, failed first round games, blown second half of the seasons, blow first half of the seasons, injury, players going to jail, owners who seemed like they just wanted profit be damned if we could win or not cause either way they get paid. Some fans are so sick of it they troll the ones left, like me, that no matter what, I'm there on Sunday or Monday, rooting them on. I live in Indiana now and I wear my Lions gear with pride. Why? Because we win? No because I am a Lion win or lose. But I'm getting sick of this shit. I want to win. Stafford deserves it. Literally for him. He is so dedicated to his team and the city. None of us know what really goes on in the locker room. Period. We can read about a source that says such and such and I believe it as much as I believe my sisters gossip. It's time to start winning. But even if we don't I'll still be a Lions fan. I'll still say aye to make fun of Canadians. I'll still think Ohio is complete and utter trash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Didn't Trump just say yesterday he wants to undo the restrictions put in place to stop infection? I'm still looking for how the WHO responds to that but I can't find anything. If they do that then none of this shit makes sense and how is anyone supposed to take anything seriously if they don't. I have two young children and older parents so wtf should me and my family do to protect everyone if no one will stay constant on wtf is needed. Why are there even opinions about this, why aren't we basing our decisions on facts? I'm lost honestly Edit: Stop DMing me telling me I'm an idiot. It's simple. I have children and a wife. None of us can get a straight answer to what we should do from day to day without some idiot on TV saying something like oh yeah 600 people a day die in Italy but who cares let's lift the restrictions. Well I don't want to be the reason that a 72 year old lady dies because I went to Kroger to buy milk. I don't want to find that oh shoot your child has it because your child had an issue that makes this deadly. How about no? How about we do what is best for the entire Human Race and not just some fucking rich people sitting in a 15 room home. Fuck you people out there can't buy food because there isn't any because YOU'RE SCARING THE ENTIRE POPULATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY SHIT RIGHT. Or people are confused which can be worse. Confused is what you saw at the grocery stores. In the end I'm a grow man who has no idea what he's supposed to LOGICALLY do to protect his family and those around him. And I don't think it's a bad thing to think about someone besides myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rules say no minors so I told him I cannot post a pic of him holding it with it's wings open. He doesn't understand what Reddit is of course (and I'm not in a hurry to show it to him) but he knows that "Daddy and Mommy share pictures and stories with people" on here so he wanted to share it with someone because he can't play with any of his friends right now so you're the only people he had to share it with (because I don't trust any other subreddit to open in front of him). One of the hardest things about all of this is trying to find new ways to keep my 3yo and 6yo with things to do when we can't go anywhere. If anyone has any tips please drop them on this comment. So now it's off to hide in the garage and smoke now that the kids are always home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so as someone who lives in the US and hears all this crap on the news, none of this is understandable to me. Oh and this has nothing to do with the people of Iran only it's leaders. I'm pretty sure the people of Iran just want to go to work, buy groceries and speak freely. I'm also not saying they currently can't because I have 0% accurate information. Mainly because someone who lives in Iran hasn't said "I want this in life" to me so I don't assume. My question is, why in the hell do you care what the US or China or Russia has to say? Don't you have a Government? Aren't they supposed to do what is right for THEIR people? As an American idgaf what Iran is up to. I do however care about the humans that live there because I want to visit some day. Those areas have some of the oldest and amazing history on Earth. And seeing Cafe's and eateries in Iran, it's pretty cool looking how it's set up mostly to be open air. So what do you want? Do you need help from other countries? I don't care about Government shit or religious, those are your beliefs and more power to you. But what do the damn normal people of Iran really need? And if Iran does need things how would, let's say us as Americans, help? I couldn't trust any charity or origination here because I would have zero way of knowing if anything actually made it to Iran.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Firstly, thank you very much for the amazing detail. 99.9% of that I had no idea about. I thought I knew most of WWII but never heard of that. That's the kind of stuff they like to keep quiet. I'm a Republican but am currently ashamed of who our President is. I would prefer him to talk a lot freaking less. What a lot of Americans are scared of is a war if the Government of Iran feels backed in a corner. Then normal people of Iran get caught up in it. I don't trust Democrats because they tried to put Hillary in office when she is a damn criminal. Period. But do you want America involved? Can America help you get free real elections? Do the people of Iran have the ability to stand up and make that happen or will it lead to more death? If you are in Iran we live in two different worlds, brother. I do call out Pelosi and Kerry because they are insane. CNN is trash. And I support the people of Iran not because they are people of Iran, but because they are people. We were not put on this Earth to be controlled and horded and exploited. We're all people, not possessions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Fort Wayne and there hasn't been a single person in weeks that I've talked to that actually cares about this. There are kids in large groups all over our street, people throwing parties a couple houses away, ect. As time goes on people are starting to care less. It hasn't even been that long but every day seems to drag on and every day there is a new 2 hours of Trump or someone on TV saying oh the worst is to come, oh we think we might open the economy again, oh y'all goona die. Wtf. There is money coming to everyone on April 9th. Oh wait, nvm Mid April. April 9th isn't mid April. Oh we'll put a website for people to put in their direct deposit before the money goes out. It's 4/7 and it's supposed to go out in 2 days? Look, nothing anyone said they were going to do has happened yet. Oh well no one can be evicted because you lost work because of COVID-19 but they can evict you after for failure to pay during. Oh well there will be more money for unemployment. Okay, where is it? I feel like if locking down everyone will save lives then okay. Let's save lives. But remember that this isn't our fault and we want to work but we aren't allowed to but oh every company will help. Welp that isn't the emails and letters that are being sent to customers. Some are the opposite. I just needed to get that out of my head. I'm married with two young children and I don't know how to do this. I cannot make the right decision or choices for my children if I cannot get my thoughts straight. Yet I seem to read and hear complete different stories. Hell, I was legit bullied and banned from the Fort Wayne subreddit when no one believed me that Landlords were sending out notices saying "lol oh well pay or you're out when this is over". "oh that didn't happen, you're fear mongering" welp, hundreds of people have posted the same things. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I just love reading your comments. It's the most human interaction I've had in a while. It felt good to type all that out. As an adult people forget that yeah, we are husbands, wifes, mothers and fathers but we are human and we get scared. Do I think this is the end of the world? Hell no. Do I think things will change forever? Yeah, a little. Humans aren't the smartest as time passes. My children might come first and that's okay, but as their father if I don't have a way to get things out of my head, how can I manage to put on a smile in front of them? If you have kids you know they can feel moods even when you think you aren't showing any emotion. I'm staying home because I might not be at risk (as we know of and honestly, it's too early to know anything for sure) but what if I go to Kroger and I walk past a guy who I give it to and he passes it and blah blah blah an 82yo grandmother dies. Because of me. Yeah I can't live with shit like that. So yeah, we're laid off. We're bored. We're worried. But we're here, we're alive and because of the comments down there, I no longer feel like I was shouting into the wind. I needed that. Thank you for for being on today. Just because I know the right answers and know what I should do, there is that little bit that sometimes needs to hear it from someone else to reaffirm what we already know. I'm not an idiot, I'm human. And honestly, being human is hard af sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is true. No one ever said don't go outside. I believe the CDC and the state of Indiana have both said "get out and get sun, go for a walk, just stay 6' away from people not living in your home". There nothing wrong with going out. There is something wrong with parents letting huge groups of children play together and hop from law to law interacting with everyone. But that doesn't mean you cannot step out of your home, as much as this worries me and I fear for people who are passing, but a lot can be done if everyone is on the same page and that page is thinking about others and yourself. Not just one or the other. The majority of Fort Wayne is amazing. But this driving down Ardmore at 9pm watching people driving 50 through red lights like they aren't there is getting kinda freaky. Watching the guy doing donuts under the light at Thomas Rd at 5am was kinda weird too. I would like to echo what the Fort Wayne Police said today: The majority of citizens of this city are doing great. But the ones that aren't are doing the absolute most</TEXT>

She made it perfectly clear she wasn't staying inside for something that was put here by god to force us to realize that pornography is a plague on our souls. I just said nothing and left.

I am seeing farmers having to throw squash in a pile because people decided to panic shop and now fresh healthy food is going to waste. Farmers are why we eat. Farmers get damn near no freaking appreciation for waking up before everyone else and making sure we all don't starve to death. Farmers do not get enough credit.

    <TEXT>Yeah. I remember seeing on the news how they were going to add $600 to your unemployment and we were all going to get $1200 checks on April 9th. Welp, not a lot has been said and Indiana doesn't have the money yet. In fact I believe they said people in Indiana wouldn't get the extra until May 1st. It is retroactive but hey, I mean who needs food now right? Or pay our bills? I mean all the people make the decisions are uber rich. Nothing like saying "you are not allowed to go to work" and then wonder why bills aren't paid. I sure see a lot of Landlords reminding tenets that they can be evicted when it's over.

    <TEXT>That isn't true. There are law enforcement on several subs. They usually stay on the subs that could lead to info like drug running and sex offenses. There are examples in Minnesota of the ATF using reddit to find a stolen truck full of Tide. This was done after a tip about a photo of the truck on reddit. It was the 3rd truck stolen. I don't remember the year but I was living in Waconia, MN at the time and it was in the Eden Prairie, MN newspaper. In New Mexico a 11 year old girl was saved from info posted on reddit. I am linking nothing with this gay mod up there. Edit: I misspoke. The mods of this sub are the glue that holds us together. I beg for forgiveness. I want to thank you for putting your dick down and helping us keep this sub clean. We love you and thank you for what you do. You'e a Steely Eyed Missile Man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>right. There is no human behind anything. No some of us didn't wake up this morning to realize that we aren't getting paid for a long time and I now have -$134.07 in my account and I can't pay rent, no stimulus money showed up like it was supposed to NO ONE BEHIND THESE POSTS ARE GOING THROUGH ANYTHING AND I HAVE TO SIT HERE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO I CAN BUY MILK OR ANYTHING FOR MY KIDS WITH NO INCOME FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE I can't even pawn my stuff to feed my family because they are closed. I might lose my home at the end of all this. I was awake this morning scared af because my wife and I don't know how to not have money, this is new to us and I saw that and I laughed and I was tired and I thought it would be funny but it would have been easier to just downvote it and move on. So yeah, I'm fragile. And I don't want pity but right now, some of us, reddit is all we have. YOU ARE THE ONLY OTHER HUMAN I HAVE SPOKEN TO TODAY AND PROBABLY ALL DAY THAT ISN'T MY WIFE AND KIDS so maybe, don't type shit negative. Downvote and move on. please just leave me alone. I won't post there again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a grown ass man. I deserve to be banned from this subreddit because of that I did. This isn't a pity party and I'm not joking in the slightest. I am scared. Because of my inability to shut the fuck up I have potentially lead someone to lose what little they might have during what might be the hardest times of their lives. What I did was not okay and I am beyond sorry. But honestly, sorry isn't enough. Let this be a lesson, don't trust what a company tells you. People need to be damn sure before making a post as irresponsible as mine was. I was directed to do that by Chase themselves. Well, it now looks like they might be trying to profit off this virus. And I helped them. That is unforgivable. And I deserve to be downvoted into hell and back and then banned from this sub. I am truly sorry if my post hurt anyone. I am sorry I was not mature enough to wait and see for myself. I was trying to help. I thought I was giving at least one person hope and instead I could have lead them down a path that ruined them for the next month or so. I made a mistake and I'm going to wear it. Please, do not take things on here 100% without proof. Use your gut feeling and your best judgement because I didn't. Now I hurt my family because we have less than nothing. And it is all my fault. Look at me...don't be an idiot like me. I am sorry for misleading anyone. I hope you can understand it was not my intent. The Road To Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions.</TEXT>

I swear to you, I typed only what I was told to type by Chase Bank. He was just wrong. He just left things out. They lied. Again, I typed word for word what they said. I'm sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same. The one thing to know is that it's easier to use your debit card (they charged me $1.13 and then gave it back) and that address on your debit card needs to match the address you live at. Makes it so much easier. Also, certain items will show scanned and not show up that day, but almost always show up the next day. It's really great for a lot of things.</TEXT>

Please update banking or address information" I updated my information with my current bank and all my related info. Then it said that the site is updated once daily only. After that I went to put in my wife's info and it said that it would be deposited in (insert numbers to our account here). Know I now it would be common sense to assume if I changed it for me that it would change it for my wife since we filed jointly but I don't assume the IRS does anything correctly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a negative. If assume that I'm walking 25 mins to get somewhere then one would assume it's no loner than about 1/2 mile or so depending on how many streets you have to cross. I lived in a valley so there were brown bears in the mountains to the North and black bears on the mountains to the East. Also I grew up watching some of the coolest nature is wild shit you can imagine, but if I wanted to see a bear I needed to go look for one. Bears tend to avoid people and if you are looking at a bear then you're probably not where you should be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TL;DR (since this should be at the start and not the ending) I'll believe it when I see it. Until then, I don't count on getting shit.  #8203; When the Where's my Refund app updates is, I believe, 3am EST. I don't see why that would change. I assume they would get large batches done at once. So at 3am they say, "okay we have 4 million people getting it on Wednesday" so they update it. I'm not saying I'm right, hell I can't even prove it but the app for checking your refund did say that and I thought it still did. Guys, I'm worried. We haven't worked in three weeks, we haven't gotten unemployment yet and no word on stimulus. I put in our updated info on the 15th and it has said the same thing since. Just being honest and not paranoid or conspiracy or anything but until that money hits my account it isn't coming. The IRS and the Government have screwed the pooch on so many different levels on this whole thing I wouldn't be surprised if they came out and said "lol we have no money left, good luck". But hey, at least American Airlines will be okay. And Potbelly. And all the great businesses that sell things that WE CANNOT BUY AND IT IS LEGIT NOT OUR FAULT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually it's at 3am EST. It is the same as the "where's my refund" updates on the app. They take large batches and change them all at once. Work all day, by 3am it's all in and updated (supposed to anyway). It's always 3am. Their computers are from like 1989 or some shit, it's been the same for like 15 years. I can see why they never change anything because the moment they do something is the same moment they start fucking shit up. Like you know, giving Potbelly 10mil but yeah some of us matter too. No matter what the IRS should be freaking ashamed of themselves but they aren't. And that is the issue. They just don't give a damn anymore.  #8203; Edit: Using the word "anymore" would imply that they ever cared. So just put a period after "damn". At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Trump came out tomorrow and said "lol welp, we ran out of money, sucks to suck". At this point it would be like "oh that crazy ole trump" because he's fucking insane</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No where. Cnet, Forbes, the IRS, Detroit News, Washington Post, NY Times all say the same thing: PAPER CHECKS GO BY AGI NOT DIRECT DEPOSITS. I put in our DD info on the 15th. Still Nothing. I don't even expect it till next week . Yeah I'm freaking out but I don't...lie.. No one links a new story or report about how DD is by AGI and every time someone on here says that I go online and ohp the info is the same. Until someone links a story that says exactly "People who are getting DD are being processed by AGI then I'm not believing it. People are getting mad and going "if this or this does or doesn't happen it means this" with no proof. Just cause it sounds good. Hey, we are all freaking out here and rightly so. But it does not good to pass on incorrect info. The best thing we all can do is ask for "proof" of something. Oh and if you're posting be ready to link your source. And it better not be from The Onion or Fox News.</TEXT>

I don't see it as a repost unless it's been reposted on here. I don't post to get karma or awards. I post because someone might laugh. Idk. I'm high, I though it was funny, I posted it.

    <TEXT>I know there are a ton of posts today of all the people who got their info updated on the site. Same here. 4/15 I entered DD info online. We have no special tax stuff. We file every year. We have two children. We're expecting $3400 (which is so badly needed). Our deposit date is 4/30/2020. Also to any of you out there going through money trouble: We get it. You are not yelling into the wind. You are an adult (I assume) and you have worries and you're scared. That's okay. You're human. When we got laid off we thought this is going to be easy. Wrong. We filed for unemployment and somehow accidentally after all that, hit a button that said we don't want the unemployment. My wife cried and called yesterday to check her next call in date and the system was basically "You said last week you didn't want your money are you sure cause if you screwed up you can fix it now and still get your check on time". YOOOO!!! It looks like it is going to be okay. And if you are not one of those that are okay then tell someone. Reach out. It isn't your fault you're not allowed to work. But they make it your fault you can't pay bills. Some people are feeling alone, depressed and scared. You might not agree with it but it's happening. And people need to know their voice is heard. Well there are 19.6k people on this sub who hear you and only hope the best for each and every one of you. Keep your head up, we'll be okay even if it doesn't feel like it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's amazing how fast anything can get done, until it involves the people who run this country. Oh and in case people forget, we run the country. Trump is supposed to speak for us. I am not trying to get into a debate, I am not saying Trump bad, that doesn't need to dilute this thread and the people who are suffering. All I'm saying is each and every one of you come before American Airline, or Panera Bread or whoever. Without all of you going to work and shopping and living your life there would be no economy. So the IRS needs to remember each one of us. And if they can't do it cause of whatever computers or workers, then it's about time to sort that shit out. It's 2020 and America acting like it's never had its shit together</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay I know one piece of info and no one will believe it and I will not tell you where I got the info. I work in IT for a normal company. There are a couple things being done behind the scenes they aren #8217;t saying. They are making it so if landlords and others access your Stimulus info they will know it and it will save it in a database until this is over and they can start arresting people for Identity theft. There is zero doubt they will smack people really fucking hard for the BS they are pulling now. Another is the amount of hourly traffic coming from repeated inquiries from the IRS site and it #8217;s like breaking it. Now again that #8217;s what I said and I #8217;m saying no more on it. But what I will say is that hopefully the IRS learns from this. Hopefully they take steps to safeguard us in the future and cut some of that tape stopping us from getting paid. None of us deserve to suffer because of poor damn planning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tonight is supposed to be the 4/30 deposits for millions. A lot of people who updated their info on 4/15 should be getting their checks after midnight tonight. I just wanted to wish you all luck. A lot of you, myself included, have been without. Some got their last checks and started paying bills until there was nothing. You did this in fear of losing things or your home or your electric. Things you shouldn't have to worry about. And it legit breaks my heart. Well, hopefully tonight is your night. Hopefully. Also, I want to remind everyone, including myself, to remember what it was like waiting for this and having nothing. That we might use this money correctly to better our situations. Keep food on the table, pay our rent or other bills. Don't forget about your mental health though. Money doesn't fix fear. But it does help give you less to be fearful about. So if you are still in trouble, if you just want to get something off your chest then drop it down here. We don't have shit to do but chill out and talk to each other. This sub has shown what happens when large groups of people are in need, we talk, we work together and we weed out the BS from the Facts and pass it on hoping someone might find relief in knowing what we know. This post isn't for karma. Idc if you upvote, downvote, dance a dance or nose breath. This is because there is at least one person in this sub crying today. Someone who is scared for themselves or their family. This post is for them. We're here and we got you. We are in this together and when you have your money, don't you dare forget about those that don't. They were you just the day before. With all my heart, I wish you all luck tonight. I hope you're happy. I hope you're safe. And if you're not, tell someone. Tell us. You will not be alone</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm having an iPhone issue even Apple can't fully explain</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-29 12:56:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I cannot get help with Apple support. I want to make this perfectly clear, this involves over 11 phone calls over 4 months to Apple. There is ZERO information on what I need to do. It seems only users with "high knowledge" can maybe find a work around. Now I know this isn't a support thread. But I legit am out of places to find an answer. I thought I was having battery issues. I took it in and turns out it's not. It's a software issue. But no one knows what issue. It's draining batter while I look at it. Drops about 1% a second and a half. My phone will go from 100% to 53% in about 20 mins of just reading news. I was told to just wipe my phone and start over. The issue is I have an Apple Watch. I love collecting my badges in the activity app. I have almost every one from late 2017 because I lost my one from the years before when I upgraded my watch and forgot to unpair it before I switched. So how do I do this and not lose my badges? If I wipe my phone and reinstall the backup will it just give me back the software issue? I'm sorry, I legit have no idea. And again, Apple has no idea if it works either. They are "unsure". If I would send an email to "everythingapplepro" I would . He's just smart. He dives in deep. He tries things. He just might know. But there is no way to ask him. Anyone have an idea at all on a course of action?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to keep Apple Watch Activity Badges when doing a reset on your phone</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-29 13:01:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR: Dealing with apple 4 months and they are 100% unsure what will happen and if I can keep the badges in a certain way. No matter what you read or link, Apple themselves are unsure. That is why I'm here. I am out of places to ask. I went to take my iPhone 6S in to get the battery replaced. I was losing about 1% every second and a half when I was reading the news in an app. The testing said it was not the batter but a software issue. They said the only thing to do was to wipe the phone and start over. They are unsure if I take back it up and reinstall it all if it would transfer the issue back on. If it would fail because it's corrupt. They are UNSURE if iCloud backs up ACTIVITY BADGES. I am only worried about how to keep my badges. I worked hard for them. Does anyone have any ideas? I would like to buy myself and my wife each a new iPhone tomorrow but cannot find a 100% correct answer. Yes I have posted on iPhone support threads. I have been doing this for a long time. I have found no answers yet. And neither has several reps at Apple Support. Thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look, it's 3:44 am. I wake up at 4:30 am for work. The neighbors were blaring their music again until 1:30 am and it woke up my 3yo. This has been several times this past couple weeks. I'm so tired. This day is going to be shit for me and I know this isn't what is wanted on here but hey, since my day is going to be horrid I just hope you guys have a better one. Most of us know what it's like to pull 12 hours on little sleep. Have a great day and try and be happy. And try not to trash me too much over this post. I'm so tired I can barely type.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>STORY TIME!!!! My Grandma was in her late 60's and drove every day. One day she got in her car and backed out of the garage. She forgot to open the door. She didn't slow down she just floored it in until there was too much damage and she had to be pulled from the car. The following day she went to the DMV and turned her license in. She refused to drive because she noticed she was making a lot of really simple mistakes and then this happened. She refused to put other people around her in danger so she could keep driving. God I love that woman</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really should have stated that it would be the USA going to war for whatever reason. I was having a hard time trying to word it correctly. If anyone has an idea how I could have worded this better, that advice is welcome. Never too old to learn something new I guess Edit: what brought this question on is the whole China, Hong Kong, Taiwan issue. Let #8217;s say China rolls (or sails) into Taiwan what happens? Do we protect those that can #8217;t protect themselves or do we mind our own damn business. As a father I don #8217;t know sometimes if the crap on the news is dick measuring and nothing more or a real threat to everyone on Earth. War is fucking terrible but so is the enslavement of humans.</TEXT>

Because isn't absolute zero the complete lack of atomic movement? So we learn to cool a proton down to 0 Kelvin then won't we solve that issue?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>After smoking for over 20 years and taking breaks now and then: Let me tell you why Marijuana helps me and how it is MEDICINE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-26 16:50:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am a father and a husband. I have been smoking Marijuana for over 20 years on and off. And speaking for myself only, it is medicine. It helps my brain slow down in a way other meds could not do. It helps me think before I act. It helps me realize that maybe I'm mad af right now but I can see how me acting could lead to something bad. It helps me reason. I have rules with smoking: My children never see it, smell it or have any clue it exists. I do that because they are children and they don't need smoke in their lungs. They don't need a distraction when they have to spend years in school in a world that is completely unforgiving to you if you do not finish school. It's because my main goal is to raise my two boys to not be pieces of shit in a world where being a piece of shit can be a badge of honor (god that sounds dumb but seems to be true). So to the people out there who think smoking Marijuana is just to get high: I would not be the person I am today without it. There are days where life scares me so bad and I am scared I am failing as a father and as a person and it takes me sitting down and smoking a bowl and then I am back on track, and ready to be the Dad I know I can be. And the person I know I can be. I am having a very scary mental day. We are back to work so they took our unemployment away but we don't get paid for another week. I know some have it worse but my bad is my bad. Yours is yours. But I can tell you one thing, that without my medicine I wouldn't be able to tackle life. Marijuana made me who I am. I am not ashamed to say that. Just as you shouldn't be ashamed for taking meds for depression or high blood pressure. Thank you for listening. I hope you are all healthy and happy. And if you are sad and you feel like you are at your wits end, tell someone. I do. I tell you guys. Because sometimes, you guys are all some of us have. You are not alone and this time is hard on millions. Well there are millions of us willing to grab you by the arm and hold you up. I am a 40 year old man fighting back tears today. I need it. And damnit, I shouldn't be ashamed to say it. And neither should you. From the bottom of my heart: You are not alone. This community is here for you. We understand. And we legit love you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I try to assume it's because they don't understand how you can be a prisoner of your own mind and emotions. When you are doing everything you can to get out of your dark place or screaming to the sky just for a second of mental clarity so you can just think. When you just beg to know why you hurt or you feel that way. And then you smoke. And you slow down. The relief. It washes over you like you stepped out of an oven and onto a snow covered field and you can feel that cold breeze hit you and you close your eyes and a smile forms on your face. A smile that you always want but seems to be so out of reach. And once again you feel like you are in control. And you hold on to that feeling with all your might.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I asked this because I got a letter from Frontier Communications last week with a letter stating that not only are they not waving late fees as they stated to the FCC that they would. I understand that bills have to be paid but you cannot treat a late fee as revenue. It's supposed to be punishment for being late. And if you tell your customers one thing and you refuse to do it while being sued by the majority of the states you do business in, while going threw bankruptcy, well then maybe you don't deserve to come out of bankruptcy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mother voted for Trump. So did everyone in my family with the exception of myself. I ask her all the time "how's that vote working out for you"? Our President is trying to hinder free speech. He's a racist. He's a criminal. He's a total joke to the entire planet. I never thought I would see the day where we were this close to the President sending in troops to kill people, you know, like China. Or to try to stop free speech, you know, like China. And they are burning a city to the ground, um not exactly like China but close enough. I never thought I would see the day where the thought a another civil war was something that is said online not as a joke. I have kids. I have a wife. I will be damned if I stand by and let that fucking racist piece of trash take away what we have. No looting and burning shit down doesn't solve anything but NOTHING HAS SEEMED TO WORK seeing how they just arrested CNN for reporting the news. Cops: You need to chill the fuck out. Shit is getting real. You have murdered enough people. Though I despise violence all I can say is, how many fucking times can you punch someone in the nose before they punch you back? The fact that Trump isn't dragged out of the White House by an angry mob..and I believe if I finish that sentence I will get banned... We are in charge, not him. It's about time they start to remember that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is a combination of the Police keeping a cool head and the protesters stopping things from getting bad. A guy walked up to a coups face and the cop sprayed him and then put the can down and stood still letting others pull the guy away from the cops. They poured milk in this eyes. Again, the cops stood there. People started riding bikes about 1' away from the cops and they stood there. One person threw a bottle at the cops, the cop moved a little out of the way and then stood there. The crowd started screaming "NO THROWING THINGS, KEEP IT PEACEFUL" and they did. The cops said again tomorrow at 2 pm local time that everyone can come back and protest again. The cops are mostly not holding guns at all, just cans of spray. The important thing to take away from this is that you can protest and get your point across without burning something down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Indiana and the started to protest downtown and I called my mother who lives North of the city center (I live 1.2 miles from the protest site) and let her know that if it pops off I'm bringing the kids to her house. I wasn't high enough for that conversation. My wife is black. I'm white. We have two young boys. And I found out last night that my own mother is a die hard racist. She went on about how "if black people hate the cops so much then they should pull out all the cops out of the black areas and say F you". Also "You don't see white people rioting and burning stuff down when we're murdered by the cops" and "how ashamed you wife must be to be black when her race is acting like this". I'm putting this here because this sub is my safe place. I also assume most won't see it cause of the amount of comments. But it's been in my head and I needed to type it out. It helps. It helps because the woman that raised me stands for everything I despise. I don't feel a certain way because of who or what my wife is. I feel this way because I'm a human and not a douche. Last night I watched the Riot Police in my town stand there and do nothing wrong. ONE PERSON thew a bottle at a cop, the cop moved his foot to the side and the bottle didn't hit him. What did they do? Nothing. What did the protesters do? Lost their shit and started screaming "DON'T THROW THINGS THIS IS PEACEFUL". One girl started to kick out a window of a store. What did the cops do? Nothing. What did the protesters do? They went over and protected the business. The very few issues were caused by young men with no shirts who wanted to set things off. It didn't work. Cooler heads won. And yeah, the cops in our city proved what they stand for. The only time the cops did something is when two young men jumped on a cop car and tried to break the window as one hit the side window with a skateboard. Then they fired teargas. And then stopped. They didn't advance. They didn't attack anyone. But people like my mother...god that hurts to type. My mom. She is part of the problem. You blindly follow your "leader" no matter what. You cannot admit that someone might be wrong. I love my mother but she stands for everything that's wrong with this world. It breaks my heart. And all I want is a world where the cops do what they were made for, protection. Good cops will protect you even from yourself. To try and let you know if you take this further that you will only ruin your life more. Cops are not bad. Bad cops are bad. Those are humans behind the badge. They think, they feel and some of them I guess hate. But I will be damned if I will allow a member of my family to poison my children with those views. I respect her feelings because she has the right to think what she wants. I just choose to side with humanity on this one. Thanks for letting me bleed this out of my head today. Sometimes this sub is the closest thing to therapy that I have. Thank you all for being the best part of Reddit  #8203; Edit: The amazing, sweet, heartfelt comments I'm reading proved me right about how this is my safe place. And how you are the best part of reddit. Thank you for understanding. Thank you for showing how big your hearts are. As a father, I'm proud to raise my children in a world where you people are. This hit is for all of you. Wherever you are on this planet, you aren't far from one of us. We got you. Now It's time for some tacos</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. It's reassuring to know someone understands how hard something like this is. I mean, she's my mother. She is the Grandmother of my two beautiful young boys. And I cannot allow them to be at her house alone. Ever. Because of her hate. One of the hardest things people can come to grips with is that you beautiful, sweet, amazing, always been there to help you Grandmother can be a terrible person. She's human. Just don't let blind dedication to someone, anyone, change who you are or forget that humanity is a truly beautiful thing. I don't believe smoking marijuana made me a better person. I am a good person. No one takes that from me. Period. But what Marijuana has done is put me in touch with MILLIONS who share the same values. And yeah there are bad stoners too. That is when places like this sub band together and lift each other up. I see it all the time. We cannot afford to lose that humanity in us. And I cannot go through much more of this day without tacos. I'm fungry</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It might have something to do with when I took her to Kroger and we were shopping with my 6yo and 3yo and started yelling about an overweight person using a motorized cart. Or how she tells me that if she could have gotten away she would have killed my father back in the 80's. Or that she just wants to outlive her mother so she can pour her ashes down the toilet. I don't have mommy issues. I have terrible human issues. I am a damn good father, a completely 100% WITHOUT QUESTION devoted husband. So I spend most of my days realizing how great my life is and how it could have gone. And I never forget that. I have two boys to raise in a fucked up world and I cannot afford to fail at that. I have exactly 1 chance to not screw up my children because one day society will smash them in the face with a meth laced brick. And it's my job to get them ready for that. And I take all of this extremely seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a grown male with two kids and a wife. I wasn't handling getting older very well and it really effected me. I suffered with bulimia for over 7 years. I was unable to find much help because I was a guy. People would literally say "why don't you just stop then". I mean why didn't I think of that. To this day, and it's been 4 years now, I struggle with it. This morning when I had breakfast I had the urge but I didn't. It's a part of me that will always be there. I'll remember the feeling and how I viewed myself after I did it. I was able to stop because I met my wife. She found out I was doing it and it broke her heart. She keeps an eye on me. I don't want to be like this. I don't know why I'm scared to get older. I don't know why I see myself in a mirror a certain way but I can tell you that I don't want to. Now imagine being a guy who is scared of his own mind because he's slowly killing himself and he can't reason it. Things like that are what men are ashamed of. And I don't care how many people say "don't be ashamed blah blah blah" well it's nice a handful of people support men but there are millions that still think "stop being a crybaby and man up". It took my wife to save me because she was the singular person to give a rats ass about this guy and his eating disorder.</TEXT>

No matter who you are if a cop is trying to kill you, I would stand up for you or anyone. There is no other way this will work. Until people on the spot say no. Until Cops tell other cops no. It won't be pretty and I hope no one gets hurt but being peaceful didn't work. And then you get exactly what you said..a spark. Welp the world if filled with gas.

You changed those words later and then said I was basically "supposed to know what I mean" how the fuck can I do that I don't know you but you think I am supposed to know what you mean? SHOW ME WHERE ALL THESE AMERICANS ARE CHANTING DEATH TO IRAN..And a YouTube comment isn't WHITES ARE AGAINST IRAN. If you are going to say a bad people = Everyone then that is pure racism. No one any group feels the same. Not all Nazis hated jews. Not all Russians hate Americans. No all Americans hate Mexican. Bad people do bad things and all of you assholes blaming WHITE PEOPLE FOR HATING IRAN well you're full of shit. I don't hate Iran. I hate fucking racists who blame a whole race for bad people.

    <TEXT>Report away. I am saying noting hateful or racist. Actually you guys are. So you can report me all you want. But before we go let me make the point in a language you can understand: White people bad. They want to kill the people of Iran. That is what you guys were saying. So when I see THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE in the streets in Iran burning American flags and chanting "DEATH TO AMERICA" We don't sit back and say "everyone in Iran hates all Americans". Now I have had SEVERAL conversations with people on this sub. When Trump ordered the strike that killed your General we took his power away so he can't do it again. If Trump wants to move against Iran he cannot without the entire countries approval. Which he doesn't get. You don't attack a country that didn't attack you. When Trump wanted to put more sanctions on your country we said NOPE get fucked. We don't what him to do it. So as hard as it might be for you to fucking understand is that we don't Hate Iran. People who hate just hate. Just like everyone in Iran doesn't hate Americans. Maybe you take things you read online to heart. That's your fault not mine. But never once has I or anyone I ever met talked shit about your country our your people. I am a white man. My wife is black. My children are mixed. DON'T FUCKING MISUNDERSTAND THAT I KNOW WHAT RACISM IS. We're setting fire to our own country to stop racism. Just because you are in Iran doesn't mean we hate you. You assume it does. You don't see what I'm typing is saying that "just because 100,000 white people might hate Iran doesn't mean the other 400,000,000 do. Because they don't. Now sit back and not realize I was RESPONDING TO ONLY WHAT WAS SAID instead of what you think I'm saying. Now I don't care if you report me. Wtf is going to happen? They ban me from this sub? So what. You are literally losing your shit on me and this is the first time I've seen that on this sub. So it's not me Dear, it's you. Again, of all the people I've talked to on here you are the first to accuse all white people of racism. That ma'am, is wrong. No go find your report button and think someone gives a shit because you are unable to read what is typed. Be an adult. Don't assume. Read what is typed. I mean I really don't like you. But I don't dislike you because you are in Iran. Shit I hope to fucking god you and everyone there get what you want from your Government and if not, I hope one day our president won't be a piece of shit. Because Trump is a piece of shit. So is any racist whit fuck. And our leader is a racist white fuck. My mother MY OWN MOTHER IS A RACIST WHITE FUCK. And I don't like her either. But I will not raise my children to be racist. And you are not going to tell me white Americans hate Iran. We don't. Hateful people hate. Now, you have a report button to find. I mean I would use a block button instead of crying like a child and saying 'IMMA TELL ON YOU" cause I broke no rules on reddit. This sub maybe but at this point, after what I read, I'm the only one NOT spouting hate. That ma'am is coming from your side. But just like everyon else, god damn someone say "I misunderstood" cause then you have to admit that maybe I'm not a racist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, you don't understand real white supremacists. They hate everyone. You're just wrong. I cannot stress enough that just because you read a fucking YouTube comment doesn't mean those are real white supremacists. That's not how they work. First, if I was blind then I wouldn't be reading. And, try to follow along now, that you also change "THIS IS WHAT I MEANT" I have stated that several times. You attacked me for stating something. I said but you said this. You said I meant to say this I changed it. Than I got blasted for what I said because your context changed. You are telling me what happens in my country. You don't know. We do. I don't know what happens in your country. You do. Don't make a point, try to back it up on something that you could not know. YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS HERE UNLESS YOU ARE HERE. Accept that. Accept that you think all WHITE SUPREMACISTS hate you. Well to be completely honest there are almost no White Supremacists left in America. We stomp that shit out. There are more in Germany than in America. Some fucking 11yo typing in a YouTube comment section isn't a racist. He's a fucking idiot. Now, really you need to figure out why you cannot admit when you're mistaken. If not then you are dangrous. I used to despise Iran. Fucking hate your country. With the passion. Because I thought all the radicals hated Americans. Just to find out we were lied to and just because you hated America doesn't mean you hated AMERICANS. And I'm still typing because someone needs to smack you in the head and say "you assumed wrong". And you should be an adult and admit it. Have a nice rest of your day</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just because you hate does not make you a white supremacists. Being a racist does not put you in a group. People put you in that group to say that "this group is the problem" instead of "people who hate are a problem". Look, you said studies right? So you are in school. In all of history, IN ALL OF RECORDED HISTORY people have hated people because they are different. Saying it's only "white supremacists" is scary. There are people in the middle east who want to destroy the Jewish people. Does that make them all just a bunch of "jew haters"? It makes them racist assholes. Does a white cop killing a black man make him a "white supremacists"? No it makes him an asshole. You are so busy trying to prove the point you want to drive home you failed to see our views are the same. I cannot stress this enough: In America we don't tolerate Racism. But wait, what is wrong with that statement? It's not true. As much as I say it and believe it, it's not true. So let me try this again: We as humans do not tolerate racism. From anyone against anyone. Sometimes we feel outnumbered. Sometimes it seems like a losing battle. But as long as you say "it's white supremacists" instead of "people" you fail to see it's a human problem on a global scale. And you and me both have the same job. To fucking end it. Now. Please, try and reread what I wrote. I don't care if you have studies this is studying. You are learning that your people aren't has hated as you thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are dangerous. All you see is hate and racism. People like you scare me. Sitting her telling you about how you aren't hated and you can't see it. You argue until you convince yourself that we're overrun with nothing but racists. You are as bad as the people you are accusing. You young lady, are breeding hate. You are part of the problem. You are the one wanting to punch people. You are the one accusing an entire race of thinking the same. Until you changed it "to what I really mean that is". No. You need to be kicked off this sub. There is no place for hate and racism when the world is fighting against it. So keep hating everyone while saying you don't like what is happening in your own country. You are one step away from being a radical. Or maybe you already are. Either way I despise racists. And that is you. No matter if you like it or not. SO go to school, spout your hate and tell everyone how the white man is a racist. And how American is full of white supremacists. Go burn our flag and chant death to america. Stop blaming everyone for the fact you saw a fucking YouTube comment section. I reported you to reddit and to the mods. I included the link because I know what I said. And I have no issue with others seeing it. Only one of us was accusing. Only one sees hate in color. And that person is you. I'm sorry I'm white. I'm sorry you don't like me because I'm white. That breaks my heart. I don't hate you. I dislike you. Not because of what you are or where you live, but because you hate. Now I'm using the block button. I hope one day you look inside yourself and see you are part of the issue. Until then, I hope your studies go well. Go be what you want to be in life, as long as it isn't a hateful radical who stands around burning flags. And how dare you say that when you are a woman in a country where you have very little rights because you are a female.. That is wrong. But keep saying how bad we are. I pray for you and everyone on Earth. I don't see a difference. You do. Have a good rest of your life.</TEXT>

You are not focusing on what's important. I have a microwave that makes shit snacks. This isn't about if you smoke weed. I do. Have you bitten into a Bagel Bite that is half frozen and half cooked?

    <TITLE>Day #3 of quitting smoking cigarettes and it's the hardest thing I've ever done</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-20 23:35:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been smoking cigarettes for over 20 years, which is over half my life. And this is insanely hard. Without Marijuana I would not have made it this far. Yes it's only 3 days but it gets really bad on day 3. That's when your body is starting to learn to function without Nicotine and weird things start to happen. I was fighting with my own brain starting yesterday. I was trying to find an excuse to smoke and I refused to do it. I know that sounds like I'm crazy but it's real. My body has been depending on Nicotine for son long that it doesn't function right without it. I know how mad I feel inside and how much I want to lose my shit but I have a wife and two small boys and I cannot forget why I am quitting. I want to watch my boys grow up. I don't want to die early and leave my wife alone. It's more than for myself. But truly, I no longer want to smoke so at least that helps. When I get the urge so bad that I cannot shake the thought I just smoke a bowl and chill. Take my mind off it. It doesn't work all the time but it works often enough to help. I can breath so much better. I can taste things better. But I feel lost doing normal things like driving or just sitting outside. I haven't done those things without cigarettes in as long as I can remember. Do not take this lightly. Cigarettes kill and they make you rely on them. What a horrible thing. I don't believe I'm weak or less of a man or person because this is hard. I don't feel less because of an addiction. It took a long time to realize that I was not in control and I decided to take that power back. And I will not fail but I know I have a very long road ahead of me. My father quit smoking a long time ago and if you ask him if he ever thinks about it he says "Every day of my life. I wake up think of smoking and it's been that way for the last 22 years". He quit 22 years ago and it's a struggle. The smell. The sight of it. The feeling of drinking a cup of coffee, which he had to give up because he couldn't do one without the other. So if you read this and you don't smoke cigarettes DON'T EVER START. If you are new to it STOP NOW BEFORE IT GETS BAD because it will. If you are a life long smoker and are thinking of quitting let me tell you this: Make sure you have someone you can rely on to help you through it. Try your hardest to reason with yourself and remember that you are going through withdrawal and it can cause mental issues sometimes and not to take it out on people around you. I haven't lost my temper because I make sure to always think about how I'm feeling and what is causing it. And let me tell you, it's exhausting and I am not kidding. It's also a wake-up call to yourself. Anyway, I needed to type and I needed to think and I needed something to do because I want to go out into the garage and smoke and I cannot do that. I have a long way to go and I'm ready for it. And being able to come here and type and get these thoughts out help so much. Take care everyone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Serious question so please treat it as such: Is it safe to get my cat high?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 16:48:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have never blown smoke at my cat because I am unsure if it is safe. I have looked online and found so much conflicting data that I have no idea what to think. I'll explain why I'm asking this: When I smoke my cat comes near me and closes her eyes and tilts her head towards me. When I move away slightly she will come on my chest and sniff my mouth and if I blow it to the side she literally moves to put her face in it. She does that a couple times and then goes to her water dish, drinks, eats and then lays in the middle of the living room floor upside down. Every time she can. I cannot stress enough that I am an adult with my own young children and a wife. I take smoking seriously and understand that I should and would never smoke around my children. They have enough to worry about in life without their dad filling their lungs with smoke. Also I have a firm belief that if someone doesn't choose to smoke, stfu and leave them alone. That includes blowing smoke at someone who didn't choose to do it. Including animals. So that being said, I love my kitties. But there is no second guessing that she is aiming to get near the smoke. She goes out of her way to put her face in it. I blew smoke to my left and down towards the ground and she jumped down off me and stuck her face right in the cloud and I shit you not she smiled. Can cats smile? I am serious about this question as I am an animal lover and I saved these two cats from being put down when they were babies. They are indoor only and they are spoiled af. And I don't want to do anything to hurt them. So anyway, I know this is long but my kids are away at their Grandmothers for the weekend cause it's the first she's seen them since COVID started (she's 62 and we didn't want to take any chances) so I've been playing League and being stoned as shit. Stay safe guys and you are all the shit. I should invite all 1.6m of you over for a bonfire. You guys can get group rates on Uber's or Taxi's. Are Taxi's still a thing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand the laughing honestly. But it #8217;s hard to ask a question people think is silly and not provoke that response even though it #8217;s important to me. I #8217;m 40 now and I see all the strides this country is taking in the legalization of Marijuana and remind people that if you don #8217;t treat it as a privilege they will take that shit away again. As well as make it harder to legalize on a federal level. And that I take very seriously. There are people doing life in prison for MARIJUANA. That needs to be remedied. So if we don #8217;t all act responsibly we #8217;re going to get nowhere. And children have enough to worry about besides marijuana. One day my boys will grow up and the world is going to smash them in the face with a meth laced brick followed closely by student debt. Children need to focus on life because navigating the changing world is hard enough</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well first we need to find how many moles are in the water. To find that: 2(1.008) = the weight of two Hydrogen atoms, then add 16 for the single oxygen 2(100.8) + 16 =18.016g/ 1 mol Then you do a fuck ton of math and end up at 6.02x10 to the 23 which is 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 18g or 18ml Then you find the size of the water molecule. The approximate diameter is 2.75 angstroms. There is 100 picometers to 1 angstrom so this is 275 picometers or 0.275 nanometers. If you break a centimeter into 10 million parts each part is one nanometer. A water molecule is about a quarter of that.</TEXT>

Couldn #8217;t really inform her of this because the person she was talking to on her phone was more important than me or the other 20+ people behind her. Cream cheese is a separate charge. Long story short I gave her cream cheese for free after she told me what a loser I was for working there and she spit right in my face on my glasses. Then she drove away in her $100,000 car after telling me about the injustice of the cost of cream cheese and how I need to prioritize customer service. I made $9.25 an hour.

    <TEXT>No. I cleaned off my glasses, took my first 10 min break then I went back to work and finished my day. The customers I was dealing with on a daily basis were mostly sweet, kind and some of them were the best part of my day. It wasn't the last time I saw her and she was never nice. But I was at my job and my goal was to move up in the company and continue to pay my rent and support myself. Also, no offense but I don't feel I deserved to sue because someone did something I didn't like. The thought never once entered my mind. Every day I had one person who wanted to be "compensated" for something. "Oh I ate all my food but I didn't like it so I want my money back or free food". I honestly believe one of the ways this county is going to shit is everyone thinks they deserve something. So if one day a worker at McDonald's tells you to "fuck off" that isn't McDonald's fault and you don't deserve to sue. It is that persons fault for saying that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My thoughts on TFT...I WISH SOME OF YOU WOULD TALK, IT GETS BORING..and other complaints</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-30 14:53:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love TFT. It's so much fun. But no one talks. Out of 10 games maybe, MAYBE 1 will have anyone talking and joking around. The game gets so dull sometimes it's nice to just talk to people. The other thing is there needs to be a different mode to it. I have always wanted to have 4 space pirates just hopping around and seeing what drops but if I do that, in the current meta, I will be the first one out or second one out. I have wanted to try so many different builds but mostly the game doesn't support that because I vs no less than 3 star guardian builds and 2 battlecast which will destroy any "just for fun build" I want to try. And I'm talking normal's not just ranked. I know that most won't agree with that because of the "why play if you're not trying to win". For fun. To do fun things. I'm not a great League player anyway. I mostly play aram because I want to enjoy playing and not try and climb when I know I don't belong in ranked. Anyway, the social aspect of this game is almost completely gone. In aram people used to talk and joke around and have a blast. Now if you talk someone says some stuff I won't post here cause I don't want to be banned. But TFT is the same way. Everyone is in normal's trying their asses off when there is zero reason to win. You get nothing extra for winning. But damn if people aren't treating it like it's master tier playing. I just want to have fun. Maybe I am the minority in this. If so then that's the way the majority wants it and it should be that way. Just, what ever happened to just having a fun playing a video game. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong but some of the most fun I've ever had in video games was on League. Also I'm not saying not to take the game seriously ever, I'm not a douche. So try and not rip into me too bad. And if I am seeing this wrong kindly explain it to me so I can learn something. Have a good one</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And there is nothing wrong with supporting who you want. No matter what we are not on this Earth to be told we cannot be free to express ourselves because one person in power feels a certain way. A Government should be run BY THE PEOPLE. The person in power is SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT YOU ASK THEM (the majority) AND LOOK OUT FOR YOU not you bow to them. I am not saying Putin is trash. Hell I have no idea what really happens because I don't trust what I'm being told most of the time. And that is a problem. People cannot be who they want and that's a problem. I'm sorry but I don't see what "country" has anything to do with anything at all anymore. It's people. Not a flag, not an ideal, but humans. All of them. We all live on this planet together and until everyone finds a way to accept each other and not dislike someone for who they are or what they want to be not much will get better. Unless that group of people want to make other groups of people disappear. As a world we should be angered that Men, Women and Children live in places like North Korea where speaking out against something lands you in prison or death. Why? You are going to deny me the right to live because I don't agree with you? I hate my fucking President and I do not support him. Trump is a piece of shit. He's a racist bigot and he acts like a child who dropped his Ice Cream Cone. I don't like Putin and I don't support him but what the hell do I know? I don't live there. But he's a spy and that, IN MY OPINION makes you not trust anyone. Maybe that is they way it needs to be. Idk. I hope everyone, no matter where you are never has to live in fear of what happens if they disagree with their Governments. And there will always be people who hate and it's the job of the people who don't to help protect the people in danger. I have a 6yo and a 3yo and they protect each other. They protect their friends if one gets hurt or runs out into the road, when we grow up we lose our humanity because there is so much fucking bad in the world that we just start to think "well only 15 people died, at least it wasn't 500" like there is a difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People asking to be treated fairly and equally isn't terrorism. It's basic human rights. Gay men and Women have been around for thousands of years. And women are not treated the same. Period. Blacks are not treated the same. Gays are not treated the same. Jews are not treated the same. I find it scary that in 2020 people still need to be told that. It reminds me of a group of people in the 30"s and 40's who tried to kill anyone who they didn't find "acceptable". And even your county stood up against that. IN FACT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE SOVIETS WE WOULD ALL BE SPEAKING GERMAN. I'm an American and even I know that we are not the reason we won the war. The Soviets were. Remember when the world stepped up against the very things you just said were "terrorist organizations".</TEXT>

Stop being a lazy chud and don't litter  #8203; I have two young boys, 6 and 3. The city we live in is dirty. You will see full trash bags split open on the side of the road. Our city is just trashed. I decided to take one day a month and we go out and pick up trash in a location. We make a game out of it and they love it. They get surprises for who picks up the most (spoiler: they both win) garbage. I've gotten a lot of flack for it but honestly, if I can get my two boys to find it repulsive to litter then I did something to help the Earth. This isn't about me "being a good dad" or "doing the right thing" it's doing what I am supposed to do. I grew up in Alaska smelling some of the cleanest air, drinking the purest natural water and looking at the most amazing things. We used to hike up a mountain called "Lazy Mountain" and sit up at the war memorial up there and smoke a joint. We would leave geocaching stuff in the tins or whatever was up there and we never left any garbage. No one did. It was clean. It doesn't matter if you live in Alaska, or Michigan or Utah or Ohio, well okay maybe not Ohio but every place is beautiful in it's own way. People just need to care about where they live. Take pride in it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-14 12:34:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think I #8217;m better than I am. I used to be super toxic 4 years ago. Blaming everyone and never me in ranked. Never out of Silver Then I switched to ARAM only and the game was fun again. I learned almost every champ and I love tanking. So below is my question: What are some normal tips to garbage players like me that just never end up doing good? I can legit play Soraka in ranked at a very high level but that is all and it #8217;s nothing to brag about. So just in general terms, what are some things players like me usually do wrong that keep us trash?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I main support. My vision score is usually over 100. I love to ward. I main Soraka supp. I also am M7 with Veigar, Ziggs, Malph and Anivia support. I am a good Leona. I see a ton of bad ADC #8217;s. Like I #8217;m not saying I #8217;m good but most are trash. I can only ADC Varus and MF. But I usually almost ALWAYS get a supp that won #8217;t play that role. No warding. See I spent years watching videos and I know what I #8217;m supposed to do. But you can #8217;t follow high tier support rules when the adc yells you left to do anything. Also I #8217;m not smart enough to do it right. My timing sucks, when I go ward deep I get caught out I am a  #8220;I will die to save you support #8221;. I legit am 100% team focused. I love teamwork. Even when you lose, great teamwork makes the game fun</TEXT>

Instead they made plans with me to do non drinking things at places that didn't serve drinks. I hated them for it. I'm older and I have two beautiful boys and a wonderful wife and them helping me stop drinking too much and realizing I had a problem just might have saved me. I stopped drinking for 4 years.

I wanted to share it. I'm sorry. I won't make that mistake again. I don't belong here. You've shown me that. I'm not funny. I am not good at making memes. I'm dull. I just, want to share.

    <TEXT>My family finally had enough and stopped helping me. It turned out it was the best thing for me. I stopped doing pills and drinking. I got a job as a baker and worked my way up. Went to college. Got married and had children. I have been on a straight path since. I lay awake some nights and I cry thinking of how I used to be and what I wasted. I can #8217;t help it. Now some say that #8217;s bad but not to me. It #8217;s a mental reminder of what I need to watch for in my two boys and not ignore warning signs. But it #8217;s also important I don #8217;t manufacture warning signs in my head as in looking for what isn #8217;t there. Honestly I believe it made me a better father and husband. No amount of anything can make me forgive myself for being a piece of shit for 22 years but I don #8217;t need forgiveness. I need to remember every single day that I had to do it on my own and it was because one day I was ready to change. I #8217;m scared that piece of shit is in me still somewhere. So I focus on what I have. You move different though life when you actually have something to lose. Fuck pride. I #8217;m a father and husband. You can have your  #8220;cool #8221; and your  #8220;tough guy #8221; shit. I have my boys. That #8217;s my new cool. And I embrace it every day of my life. Edit: typing errors</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so I have issues with this. First, they already offer free shipping on anything over $35. In some areas, mine included, that includes grocery items. At the Murphy's gas station attached to the Walmart's here you get $0.07 off just by being a member. I have never seen a Walmart branded gas station myself. Also I have memberships to Costco and Sams Club. I know most don't have both but for me that $0.05 is not a savings for me. Or anyone else that has one of those cards. I love shop and scan at Sams Club and if it works the same that's great. But I'm not sure I would pay a membership fee for that. Now if I could order something from Walmart, let's say before 11am or something and get it the same day, I might. But Idk. Walmart stock varies so widely from hour to hour. Their app isn't great at knowing what's in stock so I see a lot of "this item was canceled as it was out of stock". It happens a lot when I order now (part of the reason I avoid ordering from Walmart anymore). Step up the customer service aspect and maybe. I just...this deal sucks ass. Period</TEXT>

No shit, I spent weeks looking into "The Best Air Fryer" and I can't get a straight answer. So I looked at the reviews and now I've officially overthought it. So I'll make a post on an air fryer sub and ask people who own them what they think of the one they own. It took me like 4 months to finally pick the perfect Detroit Lions hat so this is par for the course</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Um, if this is a repost link it and I will remove my post. Also, just because I have karma doesn't mean I'm farming it. Maybe I like to post. If you could explain the end result I'm trying to achieve with karma that would be interesting. Because as far as I have come to understand, high karma gets me comments like this. Who in the hell looks at someone's karma, and actually give a shit unless it's to say something negative.</TEXT>
