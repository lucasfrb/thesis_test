    <TEXT>First, for me it's not a chasing the dragon sort of addition. I think of it more like sky diving (even though I have never sky dived). Every time it happens there is the knowledge that it will be exactly like the time before. The difference in location is what is different, the experience is the same. After it is finished a craving to experience it again and agin. For me yeeting is like a break from reality and that feeling can last for 5 minutes to 24 hours. Second, I have two veiws of myself. One side of me is what people around me see, a relatively average chubby looking person who has a bit of a self confidence issue but is interesting to talk to and is intensely shy. And my other view of myself, I hate the world and cant stand being apart of it and cant stand most everyone around. I hate myself and the fact that I'm a depressed anxious fuck that yeets and hates the fact that yeeting is the only reason that I haven't committed the die. I am neither veiws of myself and I am both at the same time. I can't see myself not yeeting, I have tried to imagine it but I have yeeted for so long in so many different forms for roughly 6 years that I don't know how to live with not. I am a contradiction I don't trust the people around me enough to truly show both sides of me. I don't want nor do I plan on recovering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm saying that its both. Sometimes I'll use logic to justify the fact that I feel illogical in my desire to yeet. I feel very self conscious about any illogical behavior I have, so I have the habit of making a logical fallacy to back up my reasoning. After I had explained this to my therapist she just simplified it pointing out how it was more of a physical addiction than a logic problem. I got annoyed because I knew she was right I just didn't want to believe that what she was saying was true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is not intended to glorify anything, I just want to show the process of addiction.  #8203; The more I see you, The more I am in pain Even tho I love you I can not explain.  #8203; When I touch you I remember you were nice. Even tho I was the one to slice.  #8203; You left a mark that will never go away. I want to sit here with you so you'll forever stay.  #8203; I dread the day, the day that I depart. I will steal my love from you, But then again you have no heart.  #8203; For when we are together, I can not refrain.  #8203; We got along so well, Until I had to pay the price.  #8203; When I first meet you all you did was lead me astray.  #8203; When I'm with you all I do is smart.  #8203;  #8203; This is not intended to glorify anything, I just want to show the process of addiction.</TEXT>
