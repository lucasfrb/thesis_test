    <TITLE>Elevation profile from the "Te Araroa" - Download</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-14 16:18:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Elevation profile according to the latest (1. October 2019) route data from [https://www.teararoa.org.nz/](https://www.teararoa.org.nz/).I didn't find a reliable source with the latest data, so I created it myself. Maybe it will help someone else. The splitted files are available as download here: [Elevation profiles as png](https://subject9223.ch/teararoa/elevation-profile-te-araroa-2019-2020/) Edit: Added elevation gain/loss to all sections [Full elevation profile Te Araroa](https://preview.redd.it/a55vfnn4kps31.png?width=3808 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=f7d8e219d6e3cddddf29d57040ac0ba49fb65db4)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I constructed the "pattern" myself. Many things were only created ad-hoc. But I'm pretty happy with the result, although I would have used .8 cubes instead of 1.43. I was worried because it has to stay bombproof for my next thru-hike in NZ with very different weather. Once i have a little more time i will create a useable pattern and share it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tooo heavy :(. It's 364 grams (13oz) with all the guylines etc.. Well it doubles as a Poncho so it's ok. Just a little bit disappointed because it's the same weight as my silnylon one (2nd Prototype before this). But of course was pretty obvious with this heavy-weight cuben version. I assume with .8 it would have been arround 260g (with guylines etc.).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true. The weight wasn't actually the primary reason to create a cuben version. It was more like the unbelievable water soaking from silnylon. When you have to use it as a poncho after a rainy night it's not really a pleasure to get into the soaked poncho-tarp in the morning. TBH i would rather have made it out of silpoly but i didn't find a sturdy enough version arround the same weight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Leonardo made drawings of two different types of hygrometers, one with a quadrant structure, the other with a balance. The model represents the first of these devices for measuring the relative humidity of the air. On the quadrant hinges a bar, at the extremities of which a sponge and a block of wax are attached: one is impermeable (the wax), while the other is hygroscopic (absorbent: the sponge or cotton) and weighs more in accordance as the air is more humid, causing the balance pans to incline and the bar to move along the graduated quadrant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. It's like 2 hiking days after Porsmork direction Landmannalaugar. There is a dirt road going to Landmannalaugar which is most of the time suited for normal cars. A lot of people use 4x4 tour buses to do the hike. But as they stopped operating because of autum/winter I managed to get a lift with another traveller. It might also be pretty expensive with the 4x4 buses.</TEXT>
