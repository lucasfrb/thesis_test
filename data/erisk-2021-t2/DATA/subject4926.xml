    <TITLE>Dracule Mihawk origins and Pernament Haki theorie</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-30 10:14:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone , i recently started making OP theories on YouTube for fun. Theories i made so far are about Elemental powers of Vinsmokes , Assassination of Big Mom and the connection between Sanji , Germa 66 , Baroque works and Don Krieg Pirates. If you are interested in them my name is TubeBeky on youtube Last few days i have been doing a big theory on Dracule Mihawk origins and his Pernament Haki. Now , i wanted to hear opinion of you guys before i make the video , cause the theory is pretty big and has a lot of info and i don't want to make it unless i am 100% shure in it. I will copy the theory and please do share any suggestion , critic on it. Dracule Mihawk is one of the strongest characters in OP universe and he holds the title of the Greatest swordsman. But how did he achieve those feats is not known to us readers. I did some detective work and i found some cool stuff that might connect the dots. There will be a lot of information in the start. When i am talking about Dracule not Dracula , i will call him Mihawk to avoid confusion, Let's start from his name and looks. His first name Dracule is based on the name Dracula and as we know Dracula is the strongest vampire. Name Dracula is translated into The son of Devil or Dragon. Mihawk and Dracula have two things in common beside the name , they are both very pale and they live in a big misty castle. His last name is also simbolic for Mihawk due to eye sight and religion. As we all know , Mihawk has Christian thematic going on around him ( because of the crosses ). If you are wondering what does Hawk have to do with Christianity... In early Christian symbolism, hooded hawk symbolized the Christian hoping in the Light of Christ even though surrounded by the darkness of this earth. And as we know , Mihawk allways wears a big hat , that makes him a hodded hawk! Before we move to his powers , i suggest you read this part of the theorie once more so that you don't get lost. His past has a lot of common with his name. I believe Mihawk sold his soul to the devil in order to become the greatest swordsman in the world ( same way Dracula sold his soul to the devil for power ). If Dracula means Son of the Devil , that would make Mihawk is the son of the devil cause he sold his soul to him. Same power came in the form of his sword but that will be explained in the pernament haki part of the video. That would explain his pale skin , he has no soul so his body feels very much empty , dead you can say. Remember the misty castle he lives in? Dracula also lives in the misty castle and one of the powers Dracula has is to turn into MIST. Ibet you Mihawk sold the soul to the Devil same as Dracula ,but , 12 years before we are at now in OP , Shanks lost his arm and Mihawk stopped fighting him , this made Mihawk regret the deal he made with the devil because he has no one to fight now. So now , Mihawk is looking for a way out , and that way out can be explained by his last name and him teaching Zoro ! In OP , main drink is Sake , but can you remember what was Mihawk drinking when Zoro came to him? He was drinking red wine. Red Wine is what connects his first name and the last name. Red wine for Mihawk can be looked at as blood for Dracula. And regarding his last name, red wine has a big simbolic meaning in Christian religion , same as Hawk. Because Mihawk is regreting his deal with the devil , he decide to do something good with the power he has so he joined WG to hunt down evil pirates. Combine that with the meaning of the Hawk in the Christian religion and you truly get that Mihawk is the hooded hawk ! He is surrounded by the darkness ( pirates , deal with the devil ) but he has hope to find a way out of that and they way out of that is hunting down pirates and making Zoro the man that will kill him and end his curse ! Regarding pernament Haki , like i said , i believe the power Mihawk got from the devil is given to him in the form of his sword , Yoru. His sword is one of the legendaries , it is quite big and it has a black blade. But despite that Mihawk said an interesting line to Zoro once , and the line goes : Without subtlety , sword is but an iron bar. What Mihawk said was , if you can't understand your sword , it's nothing but a piece of iron. I believe he was refering to the curse or the spirit of his sword. Because Mihawk can understand his sword he can unleash his full strenght. But you are asking what does that have to do with pernament haki? Mihawk or rather his sword is feeding himself with the haki of others. Each time Mihawk kills someone or cuts him, his sword or rather devil inside the sword takes the spirit ( Haki ) of the person and fuses it into the sword. Mihawk fought a lot of people in his past to achieve his goal and the people he fought were strong people who wanted the same title , each time he defeated someone his power grew and grew in power. That is how he achieved his goal</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe she is a daughter of Big Mom , but she hated her mother because how she treated her children and husbands : using them as diplomatic tools ( Pudding ) , killing them without thinking ( that Elvis looking dude ) , leaving them like they are nothing ( Lola's father ). Bonney left Big Mom to make her own name , she discarded her old last name and gave herself a new one. Soon she met Whitebeard or someone from his crew/fleet and he told he stories how WB treats his nakama like they are his sons. Because Bonney never had a real parrent , she saw one in WB. When WB was killed by BB , she wanted to kill BB cause in her eyes, BB killed the father she never had. Also when you look at it , Bonney has a slightly less haxed DF of Big Mom , where Big Mom can control the age from the inside , Bonney can do it from the outside</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will explain here in short , if you wanna watch the video , my YT name is TubeBeky , theory is there. They powers come from Haki , and each member has its own element. Reiju is life cause she can suck out poison , as we know poison is there to take a life away , but Reiju can save a life or kill someone , depending how she uses her powers. Ichiji is water probably cause when Sanji punched him when they were kids , Sanji did no damage to him , Water  gt; Fire. again , i don't wanna bother you with more details , if you are interested , watch the video ^^</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My theory is that Big Mom will stop the wedding when Nami shows her Vivre card , Pudding says she doesnt want to marry Sanji that way and many other shit. Vinsmoke will be pissed and they will kill or really hurt Big Mom , after that they will instal Capone as a Yonko cause he is easy to control and has a blood tie to Big Moms family. Fast foward few days , Luffy and rest of SH , combined with remaints of Big Mom army and some people that i believe might show up ( Crocodile and Gin ) will launch an attack against Vinsmokes and Capone. They will defeat them , Big Mom will be unable to be a yonko due to her injuries so Bonney will take that role , Lola will marry a Vinsmoke so that she finally gets what she wants ( marriage ) and the end</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still believe Vinsmokes use Elements , each Vinsmoke has its element , my first theory was kinda of since i didnt know shit about Ichiji and Niji , but now it gome some ground work. I thought Ichiji is water , Niji - win , Sanji is fire , Yonji is nature , Reiju is Life element and Papa Vinsmoke is Lighting. But now it seams that Ichiji is Wind , Niji is eletricity , Sanji is fire , Yonji is nature and Papa Vinsmoke could be nothing Ichiji is Wind , not Niji and Niji is Electric . Codename of Ichiji is Sparking Red , look at his belt buckle ,it has an image of a tornado and a flame simbol on it. His hair is like fire , those spikes resemble flames BUT , Sparking in his name , i think it is a verb not a noun. I believe that is simbolic how he treated Sanji in the past , Ichiji was the wind that would spark the flames of Sanji , hence them the name Sparking Red ! His simbol on the belt buckle can also mean that Ichiji was the wind that would suck out the flames of Sanji Niji is Eletrcic Blue , his hair resembles Wind or Water Waves which doesnt go in the favour of his element. Niji is Electric , look at his Belt Buckle , it is a thunder bolt over a skull. He also has antenas like a radio , he is Kaminari of One Piece , he can use Eletricity to charge himself up or his radio Yonji also has a special Belt Buckle but i can't think of anything that would connect it to his nature element If we know check their names like this : Poison Pink ( noun + colour ) ,, Sparking Red ( verb + colour ) , Electric Blue ( noun + colour ) , Sanji would be verb + colour too and his codename would have to something with Yonji like Burning Green , something in that fashion. We can see the theme: one with a noun and a colour , then a verb and a colour and again noun and so on. It ends with Yonji who is a Wrinch Green ( Noun + colour )</TEXT>

Honeslty , for me his DF is one of the most OP ones in the world of One Piece. When i think what other users of shadow abilities can do from other mangas and animes ( Shikamaru best character in Naruto period , Juha Bach and Shunsui Kyoraku ) , Morriah just seems meeeeh.

We saw in this chapter that Judge never considered Sanji to be strong , he was suprised that Sanji knows haki when considered how weak he was. That wind attack was most likely due to a big force of impact. We've see this with CP9 and many more characters. And like i said , Judge probably harnesed the power of his cildren and gave it to himself</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am here to defend X Drake and get hate for it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-11 17:45:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen a lot of people he is a fodder because of his actions at S.A. and later on when we saw him fight that robot guy. Let's talk about his actions on SA. Main problem people have there is that he lost way to fast to Pacifista when he transformed and later on to Kizaru... First thing that needs to be said , X Drake managed to stop GOD UROUGE and Killer in mid fight without any problem. He is strong enough to kick Pacifista away with just ONE kick , Sanji nearly broke his leg trying to do that and strenght of Sanji is not something to be joked around. His bounty before timeskip is 220 Mil , that is 100 mil more than Zoro and that is saying much about X Drakes power level BEFORE timeskip. As a former rear admiral he has information about Pacifistas and Vegapunk making him a even bigger threat. Now like i said , people have problems when it comes to his fight against a pacifista and Kizaru. It took Sanji , Zoro and Luffy to take one Pacifista down and Law  amp; Kid to take down another , it makes no sense that Drake could take one down alone when it took them to take one. And as for Kizaru fight, do i need to defend him for that , it is Kizaru we are talking about... People asumed he lost to that robot guy and thus became a fodder soldier for Kaido. But i believe he beat that guy so hard that Kaido saw potential in him and made him a something in ranks of Sheepshead. But for me it is questionable that he is a calamity , if he is he would probably be a calamity of destruction due to nature of his DF Like i said , a lot of people hate him , i am ready for the hate</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Massive theory/spoiler for a possible war to come in next few chapters.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-20 19:39:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't have time to make a video for this theory so why not post it here for a civil discussion Vinsmokes and Big Mom don't have a stable relationship currently. Tension and hate is there and it only takes a single spark to start a war between them. Judge said that the only reason he brought back Sanji was to marry him off to Big Mom because he hates the thought of Ichiji , Niji , Yonji or Reiju to be in the spot that Sanji is right now. Luffy doesn't have an army to fight of Big Mom and Vinsmokes , but there is a way for him to fight them off. I bet that we will see a lot of familiar faces at the Tea Party , some of them who were once or are currently allied to Luffy. For start , Jimbei is there with his crew ready to jump in and help Luffy out. We might even see Crocodile. Those people will be the army Luffy needs to fight in this arc, but even with the help of Jimbei and people who are there , will it be enough? NO. Numbers are still not in favour of Luffy, but... We know that Big Mom has a box from Fishman island which has a bomb in it , and with the gift exchange moment coming soon, it makes room for a crazy outcome. If Big Mom gives that box to Vinsmokes and the bomb goes off in the hand of a Germa member , Judge will see that as an act of war and he will order his troops to attack the island. Germa has a big enough fleet and an army to fight against Big Mom and this war will make a chance for Luffy and his allies to save Sanji , kick some ass and escape. How will they save Sanji? Bonney will save Sanji. Bonney will turn Sanji into a child and thus make his hand a lot smaller , small enough to get rid of those bombs on his hands. Now why would Bonney save Sanji if she is a daughter of Big Mom? Easy , she hates Big Mom. Why? Because Big Mom treats her children as disposable trash ( We saw her kill her own son without any regret and she will marry Pudding to get more allies ). Reason why Bonney cried when WB dies is because she saw a real parent in him , the one that loves and cares for his children , not using them for power. Also , she saved Zoro , would be cool if she saves Sanji too just to piss of Zoro. Now with Germa fighting Big Mom and her army , Luffy has a shot to do his thing. It would be a battle between 3 "nations". Luffy and his crew with Sanji and Pedro + Jimbei and his crew , allies which will be at the tea party , Bonney , Pekoms and much more. Last battle would be Luffy ( maybe Sanji too ) vs Big Mom vs Judge. If Sanj is not in that 3 way fight , he will go and fight his brothers together with Reiju and probably Pedro</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-16 21:44:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the recent interview with Oda there was an interesting picture of his workplace http://apforums.net/showthread.php?t=42229 amp;page=22 amp;p=3663999 amp;viewfull=1#post3663999 Here is the link to the interview , picture you need is the third one which reveals that there is a paper which says, "Kaidou, King, Queen, Jack". Now i was doing some brainstorming on the OP reddit and by myself and i came up with an amazing theory which i think you will join. Now , we know that 3 calamities are Kaidos strongest warriors and by looking at the recent info we got it is safe to say that the names of the 3 calamities are King , Queen and Jack which is not a big suprise since there are a lot of theories that Kaido and his army are based on cards. *Next card is Ace , and when i think of Ace i think of a flying Ace so i think Ace in Kaidos army will have a Bird Zoan.* *You also have X Drake who is allied with Kaido and he is the number 10 card.* So much for that part of the theory so i will move on to 3 calamities powers. Ok , so we have 3 calamities and Kaido. **I believe they were made to represent 4 horsemen of the apocalypse in OP world.** **Horseman/ Calamity of War** is represented by Kaido since he wants to start the biggest war that the world has ever seen. I am in the camp that Kaido has a **Dragon Smile.** **Horseman/ Calamity of Famine** is represented by **Jack.** His name **The Drought** is the best evidence for this and as we know he has **Mammoth Devil Fruit.** **Horseman/ Calamity of Pestilence** is represented by the **Queen.** Her name could be **Queen the Sickness** and options for her DF power are various. If you wanna go for the Ancient Zoans theme you have **Pulmonoscorpius.** Pulmonoscorpius was a GIANT Scorpion who was quite dangerous in his time and he had a very strong venom. If you don't wanna go that road, she can have a **Mosquito or Plague Rat devil fruit.** **Horseman/ Calamity of Death** is represented by the **King.** His name could be **King The Reaper** and i believe his DF will be that of **Xenosmilus ( Sabertooth ).** He was quite dangerous and a brutal hunter in his time. **And that would be all , sorry if i had any spelling errors , English ain't my main language. Be shure to share this and discuss !**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which other manga do you consider to be equal or better than One Piece?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-28 22:49:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can only consider 3 mangas to be equal or better and i will explain why. **Hunter X Hunter** --  gt; Everything One Piece has , HxH has is better. If you think One Piece is good at giving certain side characters time to shine , HxH is better at it. Unique powers go in favour of HxH , i mean HxH made rubber power look cooler that One Piece and that is a statement in itself. HxH is not afraid to kill of characters on regular basis who are quite important. List goes on , if you haven't seen HxH i highly suggest checking it out , even if you watch anime instead of reading the manga you won't miss anything since anime does a very good job of following Manga. And the studio who did HxH is Madhouse ( One Punch man ) **My Hero Academia** --  gt; Equal to OP. "Fresh" manga and so far it has a lot of hype behind it. Characters are still young but full of potential. AWESOME powers and fights. If you think about trying it , don't compare it to Naruto like most people did. **Vinland Saga** --  gt; Not your usual manga. It has a very serious tone to it. It is about war and politics in Viking age , exploring America and much more. If you are into more "adult" type manga , give it a try. Let me know your opinions and thoughts on which manga do you consider to better or equal than OP</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-12-02 19:58:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>For those who don't know what Bakuman is , it is a story from an author who made Death Note ( i think it is the same dude ) about 2 friends trying to get their manga published in WSJ. One of them does the art while the other one does the story. Story shows how much it is hard to be a mangaka and how much sacrifice you have to make in order to make it big, something i never managed to grasp even tho i heard a lot of stories about certain authors and their troubles. I always respected manga authors but this story made me appreciate manga even more. I am having though times in my life now due to accumulated depression and reading manga just makes my head empty. I highly recommed that you give Bakuman a try , even if you already have huge amounts of respect towards mangakas this story is just awesome</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off , give me your best Mad Monk memes. Second , for those who don't know what it means to pull off Feitan. Feitan in HxH has the ability to convert damage he has taken into a huge Sun ( only form we know off , maybe he can transform his pain into other forms ) and burn everything in mather of seconds. The more damage he takes , more he can send back to his enemy. Do you guys think Mad Monk will have something like Feitan? **And yes i named him Man Monk cause he is the definition of a MAN**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An unpopular opinion regarding who could beat Doffy at the end on Dressrosa.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-14 23:22:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>If Luffy wasn't able to recover in time, i believe these combos would be able to take down Doffy in the climax of the fight 1) Zoro and Law , 2) Cabbage and Barto , 3) Sabo and Jesus B. Law was seriously injured so him doing it solo is no good. Zoro was pretty rested but him going solo is a no go because of speed gap. But Zoro and Law together could have a shot against Doffy. Law did have enough energy to perform a shambles on Luffy at the end of a fight , so he would be able to do a combo with Zoro there. Cabbage alone even in Hakuba form would be pretty hard. But with Barto giving him protection with his walls they would probably be able to do something. Ofc under the condition Cabbage could control Hakuba for some time. Sabo and Jesus B. Ok this might seem like a crazy duo but it is not honestly. Both of them have other shit to do, dying in Dressrosa is not one of them. I could see a short team up to take down Doffy and the return to fighting for Mera Mera no mi</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which combos would you like to see if One Piece had Dragon Ball style fusions?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-02 16:24:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>After catching up to DBS and seeing Vegito in SSB form i asked myself what would be like if One Piece characters could do that kind of fusions. Which combos would be insane or just funny to see. I'd like to hear your ideas on this one and this is just for fun. And keep in mind that Vegito fusion has its limits. I can last only an hour. It will take the body shape and personality of the dominant fighter ( Vegito has a body shape of Goku meaning Goku is stronger but his personality is that of Vegeta meaning Vegeta has a more dominant personality ) I think best combo would be Zoro and Sanji , their fusion would pretty much be the perfect fighter. Strenght and Endurance from Zoro. Speed and Intelligence from Sanji. I can't really see anything that would top them. **And name ofc would be Zosan** **Edit : And don't go straight away for the most OP combos like Akainu and Kizaru. Try to be inovative and also try to name the fusion**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do like both themes and i wish we get more comedic moments. But ever since we got into the New World i really do like One Piece more the darker it gets. It brings a lot of suspense , tension , feels etc. To name some moments that really suprised me : Doffy going on a rampage with his awaken form , Jack doing his stuff on Zou , Pudding mind games and backstory we got from Sanji. So my question is which OP theme do you prefer more. Darker or lighter? **Here is the poll link, you can do multiple answers** : http://www.strawpoll.me/12013386</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-08 17:02:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't mind his comedic gags , i missed them a lot. Only thing that was worth of praise regarding Sanji in Film Gold is how his Spectre attack looked like. **Now why am i mad at his role in the movie?** 1st he had a scrub job when doing the heist. It would be much better if he tagged along with Luffy due to his skillset , speed , and tactic intelect. Instead we got Franky which i also don't mind but Sanji would be far better option. Brook even says that on which Sanji gives a BS reason that he can't use SkyWalk so much. WTF SRSLY? You could have given him an amazing role in the movie but you cucked him once again for whatever reason you have. 2nd thing. **His fight against the Phase Phase guy. You mean to tell me that Sanji with his speed and good Obs. Haki couldn't take that guy solo so he needed Robin to help him?** **I call BULLSHIT.** **And his fight lasted less than a minute** LESS THAN A MINUTE. You mean to tell me that you can give Zoro a very good fight which i enjoyed very much. But you can't give Sanji a decent fight in the movie? I am pissed off at how he was treated in this movie. If this movie didn't have Sanji everything would be the same. I am tired of Oda giving him a shit treatment. If Oda does this shit again in WCI and gives Sanji another L i will honestly consider moving One Piece to the bench for some time.</TEXT>

Army - Dragon , Sabo , Ivankov and Kuma ( Kinda cheating here but you get the point why ) Admirals - Akainu , Kizaru , Fujitora and Aokiji ( We know nothing about Green Bull so Aokiji takes his place ) Yonkos - Whitebeard, Shanks , Big Mom and Kaido All Supernovas with Black Beard included Shichibukai - Original version but without Kuma.

    <TEXT>One Piece is a mature series sometimes and there were times when OP was about heavy subjects such as racism , slavery and poverty. But that is not the maturity i am talking about. I love One Piece in his current state but i always wondered how would One Piece be like if it was done like Berserk , Vinland Saga and more mature series? Can you guys imagine that? Which scenes/fights or whatever would have a higher impact if they were "Berserk Mature" instead of One Piece mature.</TEXT>

In Dressrosa he was so weak after eating that "candy" that it was needed to carry him around the entire arc. I don't even recall him pushing the Birdcage of how weak was he. In Zou , oh god... He cried because he was scared more than Minks cried and Minks got their limbs cut off. If he i still like this in Wano , and he gets bs power up. I won't even look at Ussop pannels. Even Nami and Chopper are giving their best in WCI. Nami fought an entire army with Luffy and Chopper managed to take down 4 of Big Moms crew members.

There are a lot of fun and useful cards in the Wild that would perform amazing in the Standard even when new adventure comes out. **Each month community votes in which 5 cards from Wild will be rotated into Standard with the rule that you can't vote in the same card twice in a row** Example , first month we vote in Loatheb , Shielded Minibot , Zombie Chow , Sludge Belcher and Dr. Boom , they get rotated into the Standard. Next month we vote in 5 new cards but we can't vote any of the cards we vote in the last month. Just an idea , give me your thoughs</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Off meta decks which are viable but MSG Meta won't allow them</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-27 10:43:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>It ain't no brainer that the current Meta is not very open to new decks , which a dam shame considering that there are a lot of cool decks you could do. I tried creating some decks which are kinda off meta and they did perform well until i met meta decks ( mostly thinking about Pirate decks here ) , so i thought i share the idea with you all if someone wants to try them and have fun Old Gods Kazakus Priest - Sounds stupid but it works , and it works well. Your goal here is to play a minion heavy game and control the board with your removals. Your finisher is the C'thun , you can add a Doomcaller to get an another shot at C'thun lethal in the end game if you are forced to use C'thun "early". Kazakus here has 2 options , either you go for a removal/revive or revive/health bonus. Why revive? Because most of the cards you will play are good minions so you are destined to revive something good. Cyromancer Mage - My fav. This will break you opponent mentally. Everything here is freeze and you should focus cards which can give you more freeze mechanics juice. Water E. is there to shit on weapons , frostbolts to screw with early aggression , Nova + Doom for extra removal , Shatter is godlike , go for freeze minions and ofc some secrets for extra defense with that cards which costs 2 less for each secret you played . If you have room add Pyroblast for a quick finish. It is a dam shame meta is like this now since there so many cool decks to be tried and played. I highly suggest you try Cyromancer , you will have so much fun freezing the aggro</TEXT>

But 10 mana 10/10 seems so boring when you consider how much you have to go through to summon it. 10 mana Pyros should have a nice effect when played that makes a difference. My first instinct is that since he looks like a Phoenix , maybe he can heal other minions or the hero. Or even have a Deathrattle that revives him as a 2/2 again.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-11 15:06:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am sure that the majority of players won't ask for free packs , free gold or free arena tickets but rather that you give the game some more content so that they feel ok to give the game money later down the road. We give you money even if we don't need to but in most cases we get nothing. **How about a campaign mode?** Lore of Warcraft is so rich on its own and when you add the card game platform you can have something really awesome. Make a story and when a player clears a level reward him based on how fast he did it and how well he did it. **This way you can give new player a far more better way to earn cards and gold rather than them wasting gold left and right and hope for the best** **What about Daily Log- In rewards?** How about giving rewards to the players who play your game everyday and give it fuel to be alive ? **They don't have to be crazy , do it something like 100 dust first day , 40 gold second day , 200 dust third day , 75 gold fourth day , 400 dust fifth day , 100 gold sixth day and a free pack of any choice on the seventh day. Seems balanced right?** **But why stop there? How about better achievement system? Dust re balance so that one legendary doesn't equal one rare card? All of these things are basic stuff for online video games. And when i see a F2P game that makes millions without this stuff , it makes me sick how much some people can be greedy in this world and how stupid we are to give more money just because we love the game and lore that we grew up with**</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-04-06 10:02:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i am playing as a Pacifist/Materialist empire. Expanded pretty well , currently have 5 planets with over 20 population on each ( except Earth ) and the 6 is Terraforming. I have a stable income of Energy and minerals with around 120 points in each science tree per month. My fleet is around the 3rd strongest currently if we don't count Fallen Empires. But my problem is a big one. I am placed at the very edge of the galaxy and my first neighbor colonized everything around me and trapped me. My border are holding well since i placed my planets right and outposts. But he just keeps expanding around me snatching 1 system at the time. He has at least 15 planets and a fleet same size as mine ( but i have better tech ). We rivaled each other but he won't attack so that i can push him back and since i am pacifist i can't attack on my own properly and even if i did he would rally his allies on me. Help me please EDIT : I managed to snatch 2 systems from him with my new Colony. He hates me even more but he is still inferior to me in terms of tech. He is expanding heavily to the west and he will have border conflict with 2 new empires so i will try to use that to my advantage</TEXT>

But since Un'Goro hit i see maybe 1-2 Priest players per day and sometimes not even that much which is a dam shame. Priest is super fun and viable now. I.came up with this deck and so far i love it.

    <TEXT>Token Druid doesn't do well against this deck because you have a lot of Agro Tools early on. You can trade pretty efficiently and come on top. That is why V. Elemental and Tar Creepers. Taunt warrior is a coin flip. That deck is made of removals and good cards overall so you are bound to get something good with each steal. Exodia Mage goes in favour of the Mage unless you get Ice Block. And that is not hard to get if you consider that Exodia games go into fatigue and you are bound to play majority of your "copy" minions. But then again Exodia Mage can just destroy any deck but Priest at least has a way of preventing that. Shaman just gets steamrolled , i didn't lose a single game to a Shaman. But this deck is weak to Rouge and it is also weak to Paladin. But no one plays Paladin so there is that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A 2 drop that will always trade for 2 minions is quite strong agaubst agro. Tar Creeper is just insane against agro , it is pretty much 3 mana give a middle finger. You can hide behind taunts that you get T. Shieldraiser and I. Tauren. Misters of Mixtures is there to heal you enough until you get your quest and when you do get your quest it is just GG against any agro deck.</TEXT>

If you wanna steer away from her good luck with housing since you can't find anything near here. I tried different map types and it is always the game Then i thought maybe it is because of my civ , like a cultural start. So i picked Nethersland since their civ gets a bonus from the start on rivers and nope again. I got put on the lake all the time.

Today i played like 9-10 games and in each one i got 3-4 endorsements mostly being good teammate. I am not a toxic person ( i rarely talk in game to begin with ) so i can't quite understand why i fell from lvl 3 to lvl 2 because i left maybe 5 games out of 100 total?

    <TITLE>So i just finished Andromeda...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-26 21:49:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I played Andromeda when it came out first and i stopped playing it because it was just... pain in the ass to play... and i didn't touch it until this week where i finished it from top to bottom. So there are few things that struck me in Andromeda that i wanna hear your take on. 1. I am pretty sure the Benefactor is Illusive man and that he killed Jien Garson so that she doesn't spill the beans on Reapers. I think this plot point will become relevant in the second part and that Cerberus will play a big role in it. I wouldn't even be suprised if Illusive man cloned himself like he did to Sheppard and traveled to Andromeda. So yea i expect Cerberus to play a role in next Andromeda. 2. Kett , oh boy. I personally feel that Ryder can't stand against them at this point. So i can't really see them being the major enemy in the second part. Someone has to fill that spot instead 3. I believe that outside of Heleus cluster there is a faction that can rival Kett. I just hope Andromeda isn't only Kett as a superpower. 4. Creator of Remnants - Now this is the best part of Andromeda for me. We know there were 2 superpowers before the events of Andromeda. You had the creator of Remnants and Angara and then you had their enemies that forced them to hide the Meridium and leave Heleus cluster. I believe the enemy in the second part will be the enemies of Jardaan and you will have Jardaan as your allies if they are not dead at this point. The plot line of the Scourge has to be resolved 5. Milky Way and Andromeda - I think it is a must that Andromeda makes contact with the Milky Way. And someone from Shepards old crew would be present then. If i am not mistaken Liara should be alive and Grunt too. 6. Quarians and Batarians - I expect them to make a return in Andromeda - yea Batarians too 7. Tann needs to die 8. Mother of Ryder - I think she will have a strong plot point in second part or third. Makes no sense to keep her alive if not</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Think about it, even if somebody spiled the beans on the Reapers it wouldn't affect anybody in Andromeda much, i dont think that is why Gerson was killed.  gt;  gt; For me it makes sense because Illusive man didn't want people to know that their families might be dead. He didn't want the people in Andromeda feel despair more than they already did when they hit the scourge.  gt; I think the "Jardaan" are people from the Milky Way, notice how the Angaran and the Remnants only started cropping up 400 years ago? That was 200 years after the Initiative left Milky Way and 200 years after the Reapers war. Within 200 years especially if we go with the Synthesis or Control ending it is totally possible for the Milky Way species to advance their technology to reach Andromeda faster and prepare for the Initiative's arrival.  gt;  gt; I did think about this and the only reason why is would say no is that the Jardaan made Angara because that species is the one that can survive in Heleus. If it were humans or any Milky way galaxy they would just create Humans or Turians or Krogan or Salarian. But Jardaan made Angara , so i believe Jardaan are like what Kett are to Angara but not in a bad way.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ashe brings me hope for the future of Overwatch</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-08 17:04:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>The last 2 seasons and the current one i was struggling to play Overwatch. As a main tank i gave my all to get out of mid Platinum and i managed to reach 3400 SR last season. I climbed around 800 SR in total with Orissa, D.va and Winston and i ended up with above 60% winrate at the end of the season with them That being said i also raged like a mother***** at every chain CC that hit me. Each day i spent an hour in quickmatch just trying to learn new tricks and improve overall skill. Which in the end wouldn't mather because someone picked Brig or Doomfist. At the start of this season i started doing placements and i am 5 wins and 4 defeats... and i can't muster anymore energy to continue. I simply lost flavour for the game. But after seeing Ashe i somewhat have hope that Overwatch will improve vastly in the future and that the game will move away from CC chain and one shots to something better. i srsly do hope the games takes a turn for better because i simply love the concept of OW and the lore and i wanna be the part of it without bashing my head after each game</TEXT>

    <TITLE>State of Soldier 76</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-04 15:01:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ever since Overwatch came out i was a huge Soldier 76 fan. His lore, his character, personality and everything regarding him is awesome to me. That being said i never actually started to play Soldier until last 2 seasons reason being i was more comfortable playing tanks and supports. During season 12 i decided to give my all and climb as much as i can which resulted in me doing a climb from 2500 to 3450-3500 when i stopped. I stopped because i was drained and i couldn't press the button to play ranked. I was burned out. So because i wasn't able to play ranked i started playing Quick Play and Arcade to mess around with my friends and while i was playing QP and Arcade i started to play more and more of Soldier and Hanzo. The more i played those two the more i noticed just how much those 2 are different in hero kit yet so alike in their roles. It got to the point where i would ask myself: Why should i play Soldier 76 when Hanzo can do everything he can much better? So i wanna dedicate this thread to adress the state of Soldier 76 and i will break down his character from top to bottom. 1. Soldier is a veteran, modified to be perfect soldier in all of aspects yet his character in game is the definition of a rookie soldier. Soldier can only hip fire with full auto. No Semi-Auto mode or aim down sight mode. Nothing which makes a soldier better than a rookie one. Because of it i think Soldier 76 should have the option to have 2 fire modes. Semi Auto and Full Auto which he can change with a press of a button. And just like Ashe he should have the option to aim down sights if needed. Anyone who played FPS will know just how much semi auto and full auto make a difference in certain situations. Same with being able to hip fire or aim down sights. Each of these 4 modes has his ups and down that change depending on the situation you are in and as such enabling this to Soldier 76 would open so much more possibilities to him. 2. Soldier 76 is 50% being able to aim and 50% being able to position properly. As such Blizzard gave him the ability tosprint to position better. But that ability lacks so so much on certain maps where Soldier has to sprint ridicolus amounts of distance to reach his desired spot from which he can fire on enemies. By doing so he makes himself open for enemy fire and he is also loosing valuable time. Now compare this to Hanzo, Widowmaker and Ashe who all have tools to position better that are much better than Soldiers. That being said i really believe Soldier 76 should have the ability to climb low to medium size walls and obstacles without him needing to use Rocket Jump which is insane to me. Why should Soldier use an ability that has 8 seconds cooldown and which isn't even created to make him position better? Can you imagine if you used Storm Arrows to position better as Hanzo? And when you rockets to position you also take damage and now you have 8 seconds cooldown on an ability that might be of use to you. 3. When it comes to Helix Rockets it is a high risk high reward ability. It is often used on tanks to remove armor and then attack them to avoid reduced damage buff armor provides. It is rarely used on squishy targets because it is often hard to hit them and because of it most Soldier players target the ground. I personally think that when it comes to Helix Rockets they should be reworked to be more like Junkrat Bombs. Soldier 76 can stack 3 rockets which refill after acertain amount of time and can be used at any time he wishes to use them. That being said they would do reduced damage in order to prevent Soldier 76 to be pre nerf Storm Arrow Hanzo. 4. Biotic Field for me doesn't suit Soldier 76 at all. It is designed to be a group heal ability but when you think about it most Soldier 76 players are on the high ground and in very few istances will they be grouped with their team. It is often used to self heal when dived. Problem is that if you are dived as Soldier you can fight of 1 enemy , 2 or more not so much and you will be forced to retreat. Now what's the point of BF there? There is non. You will throw the ground but you will be forced to retreat. I think Soldier 76 should instead be given an ability called Adrenaline Shot where he for few seconds gets a regen and damage reduction ( 10 to 15 % is enough ). It is much better for Soldier 76 when it comes to his playstyle. 5. Visor for me should be totally reworked. It is such a low skill level ability which is often countered by Rein simply keeping his shield up or any Support just pressing Q. The only time Visor is good is to clean up enemies and even then it is risky since you make yourself a moving target just screaming: Yea i am using my ult. As such i would make Visor to be more skilled based by making it so that Visor is no longer a LIDL aimbot. I would make it so that Visor instead scans targets in the area revealing their weak points which Soldier can then shoot for extra damage. Make it more about skill.  #8203; For anyone who read all of this thanks a lot. Sorry for bad English. For those who don't wanna read the entire thing i got you, here is TL: DR 1. Soldier should have Semi Auto mode and Aim Down sights mode 2. He should be able to climb low to medium high walls 3. Helix Rockets should be like Junk Bombs but would deal less damage. 4. BF should be made into Adrenaline Shot where Soldier gets self regen and damage reduction 5. Visor should be made into a mode where he can see enemy weak spots that when hit deal extra damage.</TEXT>

I never once got a start in rainforrest , all of my starts were in artic parts of the map.  #8203; I don't have any mods that impact the starting position.

    <TITLE>Quirk of Destro - Power of Words</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-10 08:08:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this is something i've been thinking off for a long time now when it comes to Destro and his quirk.  #8203; In the recent chapter we learned that the Liberation Army has a little over 100 000 members and we also learned that the number of copies the book sold is also above 100 000 copies. I find that number way too convenient.  #8203; My idea is that Destro had some kind of a quirk that can influence people and he used that quirk on his book hence why the number of Liberation army members is close to the number of copies sold.  #8203; I am not sure which would the conditions be considering CEO-Nose-Kun killed his assistant who also read the book but didn't find it interesting.  #8203; This leads me to believe some of the conditions for the Destro's quirk to take action is to either read the book from top to finish or at least agree with it somewhat.  #8203; Now you might ask yourself is this possible since he is dead , wouldn't his quirk stop working? I think it wouldn't stop working since he already placed his quirk - same as if Todoroki was to die his ice wouldn't just disappear  #8203; TLDR : Considering the number of Liberation army members and the copies sold of Destro's book i think Destro had a quirk that helped him influence people in some way.</TEXT>

I got pushed to my capitol and had to rebuild most stuff i conquered. Like each faction was sending 3 armies at me, hence why Gelt is such a high level when it is only turn 35-40 I managed to peace out Ostland and Sylvania, conquered Wisseland and finally Confederated Averland like 5 turns ago. Border Princes immediately declared war on me and here i am lol So now i am in a war against Border Princes, Clan Angrund and i feel like Orcs will go on me anytime now</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Teclis needs a rework</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-03 08:39:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love Teclis. He is by far the most interesting Legendary lord for me in the game. Starting in a place where you can fight Lizardmen, Vampire Coast, Skaven, Dark Elves, Humans, Dwarfes and Orcs i so unique its incredible. I played so far 3 big campaigns with him i noticed one glaring flaw he has - he just has too much stuff to level up and his faction buffs are weak For me what makes a great legendary lord is his focus tree that is rich but simple. Perfect example would be Malekith. Malekith has rich skill tree that is simple yet strong. Teclis on other hand has a big clumsy skill tree you will rarely see fully filled. Lets do some math. First you lvl up campaign skills and you need to sink 11 points in it. Then 4 points in army buffs to upgrade your archers bcs archers are you spine of the army - 15 points so far. You are 16 levels in and you just now are starting to get into Tecli's magic for which he is known for Teclis Magic - You need flames of phoenix bcs it is such a broken spell it would be waste not to get it. Every run i had i always used that spell and Teclis would easily have 500 kills per fight. 7 more points, 22 so far You wanna get a mount bcs spellcasters need to be mobile - 23 points Sublime focus - 5 more points - 28 in total And now you can maybe finally finish army buff skill tree - 6 more points, 34 in total You might wanna grab reduced upkeep - 37 points in total. And finally you have 3 points left if my math is correct Teclis needs A LOT of points. And unless you are farming rebellions or sacking for exp like a mad man you will rarely get that many points. And even if you do opt to farm exp you will spend like 20-30 turns doing so while most factions declare war on you. His faction buffs are weak. While +5 rank for mages is nice the 10 diplo relations with men and elves is pointless. 30 winds of magic is amazing but fireball is meh since teclis can't fly at all so fireball has a very likely chance to miss or not be in LoS. So basically you only have +5 rank for mages and 30 extra WoM. Compare that to other legendary heroes and it is obv how much Teclis is lacking. He doesn't even have increased capacity for mages or the ability to recruit them early on. In my opinion Teclis should have following buffs - not every from the list but some Ability to recruit mages early on and increased capacity for them Increased experience gain for mages - or reduced upkeep. Reduced upkeep for all Loremaster units. Double skill point gain per level If you wanna make Teclis this ultimate mage ( which he his ) then he should have buffs than enable him so</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have over 1.1k hours on TWH2 and most of it is on Empire so i know my shit when it comes to Empire. GS in this situation were massively buffed by karl franz and tech plus experience. Them going up against weak beastmen infantry is piece of cake when covered by mages and handgunners. Handgunners were on a high ground above GS heavily protected and they had free shots entire fight. Reiksguard that took most damage were MVP since their job was to hunt Cygors and Minotraurs due to their Anti Large buff Karl Franz gives. I never allowed them to reach my front line otherwise my front line that held a horde after horde would def collapse Karl Franz and Warrior priest were on containment duty. Go in there and draw big chunks of enemies towards you to relieve pressure on GS. Franz had more luck since he was massive and had regen trait from Isabella while WP took some heavy hitting. Shadow mage used Pit of Shades every time beastmen regrouped on GS line. I never really allowed beastmen to fully engage my line bcs i know while i have quality they have quantity and i always need to make sure my front line isn't overwhelmed. Now, if you don't wanna believe it fine. I can always send you a save game file</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No joke his advice is lowkey good. Handgunners often can't shoot above your infantry and you need to utilize high ground ( which you won't awalys have ) or flanking ( And risk your handgunners being rushed or not be able to shoot what you want due to range and obscure vision) . Crossbows, archers and huntsman are fine and all but when dealing with large mob groups they lack damage. Outriders with GL tho. They will shred any infantry to pieces and disrupt mobs. They can't have obscure vision like HG since they shoot above your infantry. Their speed allows them to reposition fast if necessary or escape dangerous situations. Fuck it, time for another Empire campaign</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But if you play Empire chances are you will fight Vampires - Skaven - Orcs - Norsca - Beastmen more than you will fight Chaos or any other high armor enemies. And even if you fight Empire they don't have that much armored units - GS and cav are only ones i think? All the rest will get shred by Outriders And while other races you fight have armored units they mostly use low armor ones from my experience ( I have yet to see Skaven go high armor same as Vampires or Norsca. Orcs are most likely to go armor )</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm really hopping Wood Elves get Stalking movement mechanic</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 18:01:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>After buying Wood Elves DLC bcs of the incoming update and trying to play Wood Elves i see a glaring problem with them. Wood Elves not having Stalk mechanic makes no sense considering their playstyle. Wood Elves don't have a big economy meaning they have to be careful with how many units their recruit. Considering the buffs Wood Elves get for Missile units and their economy means you will wanna maximize the potential of your army. That means you will depend on Glade Guard quite a bit until you get your economy rolling since they are best units cost wise and buffs wise. With that in mind having no stalk option is bonkers to me when someone like Alith Anar has it who has almost identical playstyle as Wood Elves - Weak Economy and reliance on Archers. In fact Alith Anar is ever stronger than Wood Elves considering his archers are on the level of Waywatchers and you get 50% upkeep on em plus your economy is way better bcs High Elves So in my opinion Wood Elves should get stalking mechanic bcs their playstyle would be just so much better with them.</TEXT>
