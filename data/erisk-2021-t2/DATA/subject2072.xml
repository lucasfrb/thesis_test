    <TEXT>1635 8148 418 I play everyday and I am pretty active. I try to help others as much as I can during events and for the Shovelstrike Quarry. I could use some help for the current event as I need to complete the last two tasks, which are a bit difficult for me to complete. I would really appreciate it and I can also help if it is needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was actually going to make a post about the relationship between Jun and the rest of Seventeen, but I feared that I might get flamed for it as I am a relatively new carat(only about 3 weeks), so my experience might be very different from old carats. A lot of carats like to think that there isn't anything between Jun and the rest of SVT because they laugh at his ''jokes'', but I can't help but feel like some of the members are laughing AT him and not WITH him. I think some of the members think he is a weird person and that might be why we see that Jun's relationship with some of the other members might be awkward. I don't know if other carats feel this way, but I especially think that Jun and Seungkwan have an awkward relationship, which might be because they have such different relationships. Also with Dino. Personally, I have seen this on multiple occasion(from the videos I have seen as a new carat), but it might just be me overanalyzing things from personal real-life experiences. As a new carat, for a while I couldn't watch any SVT content for a while because it was a bit triggering and painful to watch the members attitute towards Jun. But non of us now the members IRL and we don't know what happens behind the scenes, so my or your opinion might be completely invalid. I just really wanted to let this out because I am sure some other carats feel the same way although I couldn't find any posts about this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is the S6 Lite S Pen too small?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-02 15:32:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I am considering buying the S6 Lite for taking notes in university. I got to play around with it a bit from a friend of mine and I really like it so far. However, I am concerned that the S Pen might be too small/thin. I will be writing using the pen for a while as I study a lot, so comfort is very important to me. Could you please tell me about your experience with the pen for taking notes? Alternatives to the S Pen(if there are any good ones) would also be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-02 20:12:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've decided to buy the Tab S6 Lite for note-taking. I really like everything about this tablet, but I'm worried about the support for it and how long it will hold up, as I have heard that Samsung tablets aren't as supported as other tablets. How many years are Samsung tablets usually supported? And will it still be in good shape after a couple of years if I am mostly using it for note taking and PDFs?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have ben using Apple Pencil 1 on the iPad 10.2 2019 with Bluetooth turned OFF(I would only turn it on to connect it to the iPad). I thought Bluetooth always had to be on, but the pencil has worked without. Is there a difference in using the pencil with Bluetooth turned ON?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like they have more creative freedom opposed to Chinese members in other groups. Seventeen in general have more creative freedom than other groups because of the units: Hip Hop, Performance, Vocal. That gives every member more room to participate.</TEXT>
