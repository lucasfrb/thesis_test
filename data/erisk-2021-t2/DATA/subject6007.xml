    <TITLE>Creating a Digital Music "hub"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-11 11:30:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone ! I don't have a specific installation currently, but I'm interested in creating some sort of a "hub" where i could access and deal with my music. The idea is to a have a very straight forward installation where everything is centralized. I thought of using maybe a Raspbery Pi (Can it deliver good sound tho ?) that would be connected to an amp. The thing is, I really don't know what would do the trick, so I'm asking for help for creating if possible such a thing. Maybe it's much more simpler than what i imagine, but hey i'm just asking !  #8203; Let me explain what i would ideally want : Having my digital music on some sort of a local server (about 250Go of music on my PC at the moment) that it could access freely. Having a High quality sound output, not necessarily THE best there is, but as good as it can get. Have access to it via bluetooth if i want to use my phone or my portable music player. Can read any type of music files, Not have to start up my computer to access it,  #8203; To be clear, i'm not looking for like the speakers, the amp or anything, just a good architecture idea you guys might have ;)  #8203; Thanks in advance, have a nice day !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that one person should have the right to end his or her life in a controlled environment if they suffer from a condition they're in. I would be inclined to include very old age in it, the only problem is with people who don't have all their cerebral capacity intact. In that case, it should be prohibited. The other major"exeption" is when a person suffer from depression and needs medical assistance. Depression can, I think, be detected by medical professionals and in that case the person should be helped medically and mentally to recover from that illness. It's rather complicated because there can be many loopholes where people could take advantage of others but I think it would be a nice thing to have somewhere in the legislation. I personally would like to be able to end my life if after being very old or too sick to ever recover, I could end it "properly", in a comfortable situation.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Overused RAM and the ressource monitor doesn't show me everything</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-10 17:02:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So My PC does this sometimes. It'll get very slow, I see that my RAM is full or almost. I then close everything but it stays about the same. There's no way that that's normal, I have 16GB ! The program that use the most RAM on the screenshot I took is BitDefender so I didn't closed it but aside from that, I don't run any other program the moment I took the screenshot (link in the comments). If I reboot my computer everything goes by to normal but I wanted to know what can cause this kind of issues and if it is possible that windows doesn't show all process because I did a rough estimation relying on what's shown but it doesn't even get close to 16GB. Let me know if you need more info !</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My family is nice but I just don't care about them</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 20:02:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had a very nice childhood as far as I can remember, I was quite close to my siblings and I've had great time with them. The family got kinda riped apart when I was around 15, first with the separation of my parents and with the death of my mom. I moved to a large city not that far away to study. I was forced to be independant. My dad didn't cover my expenses so I took the first job that came along. I got quite good and now I'm financially stable and don't need anyone in that regard. I made some really good friends here that I see often. I had a real nice girlfriend quite quick, stayed together for five years and then broke up, now I live alone but that suits me right now. I like to think that everything I got now is only thanks to me and that even tho I'm not gonna be a millionnaire I can be happy and manage my life by myself.  #8203; I don't go see my grandparents more than once or twice a year. Same goes for my sisters and brothers. When I see them I have a nice time but they really bore me and I always wish I could leave early. Nowadays I avoid talking to them on the phone, I think they miss me but I kinda don't. Sometimes I wish I didn't have to see them at all and I feel guilty about it, mostly for my grandparents who are alone in the countryside and who don't have very much time left. My dad tells me to go see them when I have the time but when he tells me that it really annoys me and makes me want to stay at my place more. Thanks for reading</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not aware of everything that's happening but I feel that that's not really what's happening outside twiiter and reddit tho... I mean you said it yourself, if someone asks you you'd be calling then by how they wanna be called, that's what just trans people want ! From what I've seen the penalisation occurs when it's done in the form of harrassment, and I think it's fair to ask people not to do that in the workplace. And just as a footnote, the ones crying are mostly the conservative who get all worked up for a quite clear cut case of discrimination tbh</TEXT>
