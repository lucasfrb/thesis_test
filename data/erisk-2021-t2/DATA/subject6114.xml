    <DATE>2014-06-05 21:22:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>MY phone upgrade is due, and I can't link my current boom account with my game centre as I trialled the game using a Canadian app store account (cheeky I confess), yet I fear if I upgrade my phone I will lose my Boom progress and it will be lost in the abyss of SuperCell's servers. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On Halloween I just got back from work. I was tired and not in the mood for kids asking for sweets so I decided to order myself a burger and eat alone. Away from the festivities. After playing playsyayion for 40 minutes, the doorbell rings. I assume it's more sugar addicts trying to fill their pumpkin bowls further so ignore the bell. After another 5 minutes it rings again. I'm getting annoyed now. Another 5 minutes and a loud knock sounds. I finally jump up and stomp angrily to the front door, to find an even more angry delivery man. Yeah I forgot I ordered food. He wasn't happy at all, threw me the bag of food and walked off into the night. Tl;Dr I forgot I ordered food.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Make Dark Bow and Whip useful again</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-13 22:39:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel that items such as whip and Dark Bow (also staff of light) should be made useful again. They have high level requirements to obtain, yet are not worth very much. I feel these weapons are classic to the game and shouldn't be left to die out, as the older community outgrows them, and new players have access to far better weapons soon after. Let me know if you agree/disagree.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-01-17 20:32:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I hear that QBD is very profitable and I want to setup my account for this boss. I have nearly maxed cb. 99 defence, strength, magic, 93 range, 98 attack. 95 prayer. The issue comes from my herb and summoning; 75 and 76 respectively. I know I should train these up but they're so expensive. What levels should I be looking at? and what gear? I have royal cbow and full armadyl for range. Bandos and chaotic for melee and ganodermic for mage. Thanks for reading, I know there are guides but I don't know the minimum I can get away with. Thanks :)</TEXT>

Also herb would cost my bank but summoning would just take a while to collect more charms. Edit: looks like I'm gonna need 22k crimson? That seem too much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Reading the recent tweaks and fixes thread, I was aware that about 40% of the things that were changed this week appeared as threads here on this subreddit. Is this because some mods spend time sifting through it all or are these issues commonly complained about over many social media threads? My example being fix to teleporting whilst metamorphosis ed? I saw a thread a few days ago and that has now been fixed. I must say I'm impressed and curious. Also it must mean jagex are aware of all the constant complaints against mtx and other such content.

    <TITLE>Maxing can't be efficient.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-01 20:18:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>No skill in this game produces enough money. Going for only 99 in every skill you can't make the ~500m needed, without wasting exp. 100 hours of QBD might make you the cash for herb summoning prayer construction farming and Smith, yet slayer might only make you the cash for 95 prayer. Even so QBD requires 85 herb to be done a little quicker and maybe 20m worth of gear. I find this mildly annoying as the skills aren't balanced. Many people seem to be ok with it, but when you can't login for 10+ hours a day, efficient training is key. I have nearly got 99 in all non buyables. But now I have to decide whether to upgrade my gear and start pvming or to invest it in her Blore and summoning. Farming also worries me as I should just train it over a long period of time, but spending 1m a day on it doesn't make me feel comfortable for the small amount of exp I receive. Tl;dr the skills aren't balanced and I don't see how people can make money whilst gaining exp, as high level pvming requires buyables to begin with. Let me know if you agree or disagree.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My idea for Adamant and Runite Dragons</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-11 23:02:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Post taken from my post on page 5 of RS forums. - These will be a solo instance. - They will spawn one at a time. - To form and instance you need to forge a key out of their respective bars. - The dragons will now have new mechanics. They have wings so they can fly when taking lots of damage. Also they will charge on foot very quickly, striking you with talons and stunning you for 5 seconds. - They will be assigned as slayer tasks, and their exp will be worth the time spent. - They won't drop rune or addy bars. They will drop scales. Between 3-15 per kill. A chisel must be used to descale them. - 200 scales can be forged into a rune or adamant chest key. The key will unlock a chest that gives on average 1 - 200k loot from herbs and gems and rune or addy items. BUT a rare chance will enable you to receive a new dragonbane upgrade kit. It will attack to melee and magic items (only after completion of rotm) -(ALTERNATIVE) The main reward is dragon armour that increases your damage vs all dragons a % per piece. it is Highbrid but doesn't offer good defence. You need strong damage output to make this armour useful. It will be recharged using visages. - if you don't wish to make a key, you can Smith 3 scales into a rune or addy bar, making it a good money maker. Remember, many bars are made are day to access the instance. - also had an idea that these keys could unlock a skilling area for 12  amp; 24 hours containing many high end skilling resources and a deposit box. Thanks for reading feedback appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jagex should give bonus exp week a 48 hours of online time accessible whenever you like from when you activate it. This would allow people to play who worked weekends, people who are away or have personal reasons why they may not play. It would also have no impact on the economy as anyone could be using it at any time. Also with current server issues people may not be able to enjoy the full extent of the weekend.

    <TEXT>It seems that BF1, from what I can see so far, may turn out like Battlefront? It seems like it's not going to be customisable enough and the HUD looks sort of familiar. I hope they keep the BF4 feel with menus and spawns etc. But I'm scared it could flop. How many maps are they planning on releasing? Only seen 3 I think. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to do an assignment, 1,000 words, on what happened at this crime scene. A lot of crucial information is missing, and I am finding it very difficult to visualise what is happening. Any input at all is very helpful! Here is my crime scene map: http://imgur.com/C13p1EE Here is the information provided: http://imgur.com/LSuKbqw http://imgur.com/g9jYcAK http://imgur.com/ReZvJke So far I believe there is one person breaking an entering with a shotgun. The two ammo types lead me to believe there are two guns, one which started from within the house. I can't understand why there is a shotgun blast in the kitchen, nor the presence of cocaine in a hidden draw. And why that is relevant.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-30 14:55:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>BIO Spicy chicken in warm pittas, with a fresh tomato salsa and the perfect cooling tzatziki. It couldn #8217;t be easier to make this Greek classic. And it #8217;s all for under a tenner. NOTES Make sure you give your grated a cucumber a good squeeze before adding to the yoghurt. This way, you won #8217;t have a watery tzatziki. COOKING TIME (INCLUDES PREPARATION TIME): 45 MINUTES INGREDIENTS Red Chillies -  #163;0.60 Iceberg Lettuce -  #163;0.40 Dried Oregano -  #163;0.70 Tomatoes -  #163;1.00 Mint -  #163;0.70 2 Lemons -  #163;0.70 1 Cucumber -  #163;0.45 Yeo Valley Yoghurt -  #163;1.50 Pittas -  #163;0.50 Garlic -  #163;0.30 8 Chicken Thighs -  #163;3.00 Total Cost:  #163;9.85 - This covers absolutely everything. All we assume you have in your kitchen beforehand is SALT, PEPPER AND OLIVE OIL. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find out which shops you can buy all of the ingredients from for under  #163;10. METHOD 1. Dice chicken into small chunks. Add to bowl. Grate 3 cloves of garlic and 1 red chilli into the bowl. Add the zest of one lemon. Add 3 tablespoons of yoghurt. Add salt and pepper. Rub together and cover with cling film. Leave in fridge for 15 minutes. 2. Tzatziki time. Pour rest of yoghurt into another bowl. Add a small bunch of finely chopped mint, the juice of one lemon, and one grated cucumber. Season well and mix it all together. 3. Tomato salsa. Finely chop 5 tomatoes. Add to bowl with 2 or 3 teaspoons of oregano, salt, pepper and olive oil. 4. Finely chop your lettuce. 5. Put a griddle pan on a medium to high heat. Once it is hot, add your chicken. It needs 3 minutes on each side. 6. Warm some pittas. 7. Assemble to gyros and tuck in. More recipes available at mobkitchen.co.uk</TEXT>

Surely seeing these games the owners would have tried to hurry along any potential signings? Bringing someone in at the last hour of the window will not help anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Title is explanatory I think. 1. Would you go all in one coin? ( #163;50 isn't the end of the world if it is) 1. Or would you spread it? Character limit is kinda annoying. Hope you're having a nice day. I am asking for a friend, as I currently hold XRB, XLM, ELIX, VEN but ignore what I hold. Feel free to critique my portfolio if you wish. - I think ELIX could, despite the small and unproven dev team, be worth a few bob a coin. - XRB I think will reach $100 before Q2 - XLM is obviously on its way up. - VEN there is a lot of hype about, however got a weird feeling about it. Great partnership but nobody can really explain how the tokens will be used, and how the equivalent of GAS (THOR) will be spent. *Something I'm liking the look of is the DADI ICO. I think it's an exciting well thought out project.*</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-13 14:40:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I posted a thread a couple days ago telling people to be very wary of the Stone scam over on Bitcoin talk. See  gt;[Thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2581762.0) lt;
     **DO NOT DONATE ANYTHING TO HIM** Here is his 2 rai wallets and you can see how he has moved the cash: [Wallet 1 where he receives funds from 'donations' ](https://raiblocks.net/account/index.php?acc=xrb_3my3e88nzaorkhcbho91seniswjz7ksiu1ddkuuu5ue3q8exiian9ikhja4g) [And this is the one he sells on KuCoin through: ](https://raiblocks.net/account/index.php?acc=xrb_3irj5mihmjptchpk8rmdyriw1owm71pc4reds6udoopmb9jncam18zoxat55) If it wasn't a scam, why would he be cashing in his 'developer fund' so early on. If people fall for this then it is their fault but I am posting this to spread awareness and I hope it may one day result in the deletion of his thread on BitcoinTalk. See this: https://streamable.com/crjw1 not necessarily proof of anything, but may provide evidence as to where he got his technical lingo. Stay safe out there, everyone wants your money. ----------------- EDIT: Would it be possible for the Rai team to deny any ties with this guy?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, me and my girlfriend are planning a trip to America this summer after we graduate. We are aiming to spend around a month out in America and see as much as possible. We are mainly looking to focus on the West/South West and I think we will rent a car (is that the best option?) I was just wondering if you guys had some suggestions of must-see places. We want to see a bit of everything; cities, national parks, monuments, state specific culture etc. Just want to really try and get a feel for America in around 3-4 weeks. Any tips hugely appreciated! Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is NANO everything it says it is?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-15 13:56:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So after recent news, my NANO holding has seen red. And is continuing to do so. NANO/XRB claims it can process 7000 Transactions per second, and it appears that it could do so, however with relatively low volume. Do you think that NANO will be able to achieve what it claims it can on the big stage? Any coin that has low volume is cheap and fast to move around, however when scaling, it becomes more costly and slower. I don't understand too much about the technicalities of it all, however here is an article where some tests were conducted: https://hackernoon.com/stress-testing-the-raiblocks-network-568be62fdf6d Thanks</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-04-12 14:17:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I have no prior experience with CSS, but am trying to get my subreddit up and running. The banner looks stretched and blurry, and until I copied someones code, when I clicked the banner it took me back to reddit homepage, not my subreddits homepage. The link is: https://www.reddit.com/r/MobKitchen/ This is what is in my CSS box currently. I do not even know what it means, except that something is blocking the button that redirects me to the reddit homepage, a temporary fix. /* Change 'readers' box value */ div.titlebox span.word { display:none; } div.titlebox span.number:after { content: " Mobscribers"; } /* Change 'users here now' box value */ .users-online .word { display:none; } .users-online .word, .users-online .number:after { content: " Online" !important; } #header { background: url(%%mobreddit%%) no-repeat; height: 275px; width: 1450px; background-size: 100% 250px; } #header-bottom-left { position: absolute; bottom: 0; } .side .md [href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobKitchen/"] { position: absolute; top: 30px; left: 200px; z-index: 99; height: 30px; width: 30px; background: url(%%mobreddit%%); text-indent: -9999em; } Essentially I want to: 1. Sort out the banner so that it looks nice and clean and fits well. Here is a link to the hosted image: https://imgur.com/snAsa1C 1. Make it so that I can click on the banner when on a post, and it take me back to: reddit.com//r/MobKitchen Thanks in advance guys and hope this isn't a massive hassle</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NOTE: This video is sponsored by Tofoo. Such a delicious dish. And a great way to use up any leftover pepper! Notes: Try the tofu at the end. If it is too sugary, add a bit more pepper. If it is too peppery, add a bit more sugar. Get that balance right. --- Cooking Time (includes preparation time): 50 Minutes Ingredients: * 2 x 280g Naked Tofoo -  #163;4.00 * 2 Tablespoons Black Peppercorns (crushed) - Included in MOB Kitchen. * 2 Tablespoons White Sugar -  #163;0.80 * Large Knob Chopped Ginger -  #163;0.18 * 2 Garlic Cloves -  #163;0.30 * 4 Spring Onions -  #163;0.50 * 1 White Onion -  #163;0.16 * 5 Tablespoons of Butter -  #163;1.00 * 1 Red Chilli -  #163;0.50 * 400g Basmati Rice -  #163;0.60 * Cornflour -  #163;0.50 * 5 Tablespoons Dark Soy Sauce -  #163;0.60 * 5 Tablespoons Light Soy Sauce -  #163;0.60 Total Cost -  #163;9.75. This covers absolutely everything. All we assume you have in your kitchen beforehand is SALT, PEPPER AND OLIVE OIL. Method: 1. Chop tofu into cubes. Coat in cornflour. 1. Add some vegetable oil to a wok. Fry the tofu until browned. Remove from wok. 1. Get your rice on (follow pack instructions). 1. Clean wok. Place on the heat. Add a splash of oil. Add 4 tablespoons of butter, along with your onion, garlic and ginger. Fry until soft. At this point, add your peppercorns and sugar. Stir them in. Once the sugar has dissolved, add your soy sauce. 1. Stir it all together, and then add 1 chopped red chilli and 3 chopped spring onions. Stir, and then re-add your tofu. Stir it in, add 1 more tablespoon of butter, allowing it to melt, and then remove from the heat. 1. Serve the tofu on top of a mound of steaming rice, garnish with chopped spring onion and enjoy! --- Recipe: http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/bs-test/2018/6/27/black-pepper-tofu Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/ Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ</TEXT>

Add a tablespoon of mirin, and then mix everything together. 1. Get your rice on (follow pack instructions). 1. Add 400ml water to your pork. Turn it down to a simmer and cook for 40 minutes.

    <TEXT>The quickest, cheapest, most delicious pasta recipe there is. ### Notes: More parsley the better. The pasta water is the key ingredient here. \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 12 Minutes **Ingredients:** * 150g Parsley -  #163;1.35 * 500g Spaghetti -  #163;0.50 * Chilli Flakes -  #163;0.85 * 3 Cloves of Garlic -  #163;0.30 * Total Cost -  #163;3.00 **Method:** 1. Boil a pan of water, salt it generously and then add your spaghetti. 2. Finely slice 3 cloves of garlic and your parsley (separating stalks and leaves). 3. Add garlic, 2 teaspoons of chilli flakes and the parsley stalks to a frying pan with 4 tablespoons of olive oil. 4. Once the pasta is al dente, reserve 7-8 tablespoons of the starchy pasta water, drain the pasta, and then add it to the frying pan with the garlic and parsley. Start tossing it all together, gradually adding splashes of pasta water and the chopped parsley leaves. 5. Once everything is mixed in and the pasta is thick and almost creamy (from the pasta water), remove from heat. Serve it up with extra chopped parsley leaves on top as a garnish.

    <TEXT>Some great info in here, thanks. So working from the top of your post: 3) I want to visit Nappa Valley, and assumed it's easiest to get to from San Fran so will spend a night there before heading to, 4) Yosemite, where I have 2 nights camping booked. After that we head to North Tahoe, near Truckee for 3 nights, so will be driving directly up from there. We wanted to get from Tahoe over to Arches National park, and the route just took us through SLC, so assumed we would just stop there for a night. If you know a way to cut out that large dog-leg, then that would be great. We wanted to see Arches, Moab, Antelope Canyon before reaching Grand Canyon and eventually Vegas. Following Vegas we wanted to see Joshua Tree National Park, and then head down to San Diego and then ascending the West Coast back to San Fran.</TEXT>

Add a tablespoon and a half of butter, a handful of chopped parsley and tarragon, salt, pepper and a small drizzle of olive oil. Mash everything together. Once mashed, add your bacon and fold it through. Set mash aside. 4. Chicken time. Take a chicken breast. Cut a slit in the thick side. Work the knife and your index finger in to the slit, and make a hole to hold the butter. Ideally you want to keep the slid quite small so the butter doesn #8217;t flow out. 5. Take your butter out the fridge. Cut some small discs. Squeeze them in to the chicken hole. Repeat with the other three breasts. 6. Lay out 3 bowls. Fill one with flour, the other with 3 eggs (whisk and season with salt and pepper) and the last with breadcrumbs. 7. Dip your chicken in the flour, then the eggs, then the breadcrumbs. 8. Heat a large frying pan with a good drizzle of oil. Add your breasts to the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes each side, until the breadcrumbs and golden. 9. Remove the breasts from the frying pan and add to a roasting tray. Plan in oven for 12-15 minutes until cooked through. 10. Serve the chicken on a large spoonful of the bacony mash. Cut it open and enjoy! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-chicken-kiev**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-chicken-kiev) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A question about Lightning Network</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-10 09:24:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there,  #8203; I am doing some reading about the Lightning Network (a bit late to the party I know). If we use the analogy of a bar tab:  #8203; I was just wondering what happens if a customer walks away from their 'tab' (open payment channel)?  #8203; The way that I understand it, in this analogy, is that every time a customer orders a drink, they sign an updated version of the bar tab, verifying that they are authenticating the balance change. If they walk away and never come back to the bar, can the bar close the payment channel without the customer ever coming back? What happens to the initial deposit of funds (i.e. they put in $100 worth but only accumulated a $40 bill, what happens to the $60 that they funded the payment channel with if they never returned?)  #8203; Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Awesome, thank you very much for that. Clears it up a bit for me. How does the Layer 1 Root Chain read the chronology of the transactions between the two parties? I assume you can't just take an old balance sheet that has been verified, and try to settle it? Are old balance sheets made invalid? Or is this the part where funds are able to be stolen if foul-play is occurring?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>### Notes: Make sure you keep those halloumi sticks frying until they are nice and golden. ### Cooking Time (Including Preparation Time): 30 minutes ### Ingredients: 1 small red onion 2 mixed chillies (red and green) 3 blocks halloumi 5 tbsp plain flour 1 tbsp turmeric #160; 1 tbsp cumin seeds #160; 1 tbsp coriander seeds #160; 150g pot natural yogurt #160; 1/2 small pack mint 1 small pack coriander 1 garlic clove Squeeze lemon #160; 2 dollops mango chutney  #8203; **Method:** 1. Finely chop the red onion and slice the red chilli, put to one side. Pat the halloumi blocks dry then cut the halloumi into fries. #160; 2. Mix together the flour, turmeric, cumin and coriander seeds on a plate. Roll the fries in the mixture so that they are evenly coated. #160; 3. Blitz the yogurt with the mint, half the coriander, green chilli, garlic clove, squeeze lemon and some seasoning until vivid green. #160; 4. Fill a wide frying pan 2cm full with oil. Heat until visibly bubbling hot. Carefully lower in one of the halloumi fries as a tester, you want them to go golden but if the oil is too hot they will colour too much and burn. Cook the halloumi fries in batches until they float, draining on kitchen paper once fried. #160; 5. Pile the Indian halloumi fries on a platter, dollop on the yogurt, mango chutney. Whack on the chopped onion, chilli and the remaining coriander. #160; **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/indian-halloumi-fries**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/indian-halloumi-fries) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://ibb.co/eONrhf hijacking comment. I need to sort out my defence but budget tight. Will drop mitro after Huddersfield. Maybe for Arnie? Richarlison looking a bit flat for the minute. Really wanting to knee jerk some Bournemouth players in after watching them smash us, Wilson is some player. Think I'll sell aguero and auba which forward would you look to? Thanks.

    <TEXT>The king of the pies. The tarragon makes it. A mandatory dollop of mustard. You have to give this one a go. ### Notes: Beat up egg yolks and brush them over the pastry to make it golden. Cooking Time (includes preparation time): 1 Hour # Ingredients: * 750g Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs -  #163;1.49 * 2 Leeks -  #163;0.98 * 1 Brown Onion -  #163;0.16 * Smoked Bacon -  #163;1.25 * 1 Pint Whole Milk -  #163;0.45 * Bunch of Tarragon -  #163;0.70 * Block Puff Pastry -  #163;0.70 * Plain Flour -  #163;0.45 * 1 Egg -  #163;0.89 * Pot of Dijon Mustard -  #163;0.55 * Total Cost -  #163;8.02 - This covers absolutely everything. All we assume you have in your kitchen beforehand is SALT, PEPPER AND OLIVE OIL. # Method: 1. Preheat oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. 2. Dice up your chicken thighs into chunks. Brown them off in a large pan with some olive oil. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. 3. Finely slice your leeks, bacon and onions. 4. Add bacon to the chicken pan, and fry until crispy. Deglaze the pan with a splash of water, and then add the leeks and onion. 5. Fry until soft, adding a splash of water if the vegetables start catching on the pan. 6. Once soft, re-add the chicken. Stir it in, and then add a large handful of chopped tarragon. Stir, and then add 2 heaped tablespoons of flour. 7. Mix it in, making sure the flour is absorbed by the mixture, and then pour in a pint of milk, splash by splash. Keep stirring until you have a thick pie filling. Season generously with pepper, and then remove the pan from the heat. 8. Take a pie dish. Fill it with the filling. Then lay your puff pastry on top. Trim the sides, and brush the pastry with egg yolk wash. Add a sprinkle of salt, and then place in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed up and golden. 9. Slice your pie up, and serve with a big dollop of Dijon mustard.

    <TEXT>Great. It's essentially red onions, chilli, bay leaves, sugar, balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar. It gives it a sweet and savoury blend which goes so well with pork. Let us know how it goes!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha thank you. Yes exactly, we don't use sponsorships because we want to, but because it is how we generate revenue. We have to pay the camera man, buy the ingredients, maintain the website and hundreds of other things. Having a brand of cheese suggested to you, in my opinion, is a small price to pay in order to have free access to recipes and content, but I can completely understand peoples dislike of product placement/sponsorships. We always make it clear in the recipe that it is sponsored when it is. Thanks, and keep on cooking!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The cooking time is 30 minutes, which should be sufficient for sausages. If you are worried then you can brown it, possible cook it with some herbs or spices if you want to add extra flavour, just be careful not to burn it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi there, Yes you certainly can. We actually have a recipe we did about a year ago that combines both Aubergine and Courgette (EggPlant and Zucchini?) which I am sure you can just change the ratios according to taste.

    <TEXT>The ultimate parmigiana with a caponata twist ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 15 Minutes ## Ingredients: * 3 Sliced Aubergines * 2 Tablespoons of Capers * 2 Tablespoons Pitted Kalamata Olives * 1 Red Onion * 1 Bunch Parsley * 3 Balls of Mozzarella * 70 Grams Parmesan * Plain Flour * 4 Tablespoons Red Wine Vinegar * 3 Tins of Plum Tomatoes ## Method: 1. Slice up your Aubergines. Salt the slices and leave for 15 minutes. This will draw out the moisture. Dab with tissue. Coat the aubergine slices in flour. 2. Pour some oil into a frying pan and add the sliced aubergines to the pan and fry until slightly browned on each side. Remove and set aside. 3. Add some more oil to a pan and add the diced onions. Add parsley stalks, capers, red wine vinegar, Kalamata olives. Stir everything together, and once the vinegar has dissolved, add 3 tins of tomatoes. Break them up, and bubble on a high heat until you have a very thick sauce. Add a handful of chopped parsley, season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. 4. Get a baking dish. Spoon in a layer of your sauce. Top with a layer of aubergines. Top with a layer of sliced mozzarella, add a layer of grated parmesan, and then top with another layer of your tomato sauce. Top this with a final layer of aubergine. Add mozzarella and parmesan on top. Drizzle over some olive oil, season with pepper, and then place the dish into the oven for 35 until golden and bubbling. 5. Remove from the oven, and leave to sit for 30 minutes. This will allow it to set. Then slice it up and tuck in! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-caponata-parmigiana**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-caponata-parmigiana) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stupidly forgot to post the recipe, so as helpfully requested by u/[ZEbbEDY](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZEbbEDY) Sack off the local van  #8211; this babby recipe is the business. ## Notes Place the doner under the grill for a couple of minutes at the end to make it nice and brown. ## Cooking time (Includes preparation time): 50 Minutes ## Ingredients: * Ground Cumin -  #163;0.85 * Fennel Seeds -  #163;0.70 * Cayenne Pepper -  #163;0.85 * Dried Oregano -  #163;0.50 * Garlic -  #163;0.30 * 500g Lamb Mince -  #163;3.36 * Parsley -  #163;0.70 * 1 Lemon -  #163;0.35 * Pot of Yogurt -  #163;0.85 * 1 Cucumber -  #163;0.45 * 1 Red Onion -  #163;0.21 * 4 Pitta Breads -  #163;0.40 * Total Cost -  #163;9.75 - This covers absolutely everything. All we assume you have in your kitchen beforehand is SALT, PEPPER AND OLIVE OIL. ## Method: 1. Preheat oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F 2. Throw mince into a bowl. Add a teaspoon of cumin, a teaspoon of fennel seeds, 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne and a teaspoon of dried oregano. Add 1 grated clove of garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Mush everything together. 3. Form the mince into a fat sausage, similar to something like an aubergine, and then wrap it tightly in tin foil. Place in oven for 30 minutes. 4. Tzatziki time. Into a bowl add your yoghurt, 1 grated cucumber (squeeze gratings to remove excess water), the juice of a lemon, salt and pepper. Mix together. Cover, and chill. 5. Pickled onions. Finely slice your red onion. Place slices into a bowl. Squeeze over the top the juice of a lemon. Add a pinch of salt. Scrunch the salt and juice into the onions. Leave out until you serve. The acidity of the lemon will take the sharpness out the onion. 6. After 30 minutes, remove the lamb from the oven. Take off foil. Place it back in the oven, under the grill, for 1-2 minutes on each side, so it gets brown and crispy. Watch that it doesn't burn. 7. Remove doner from the oven. Slice it thinly with a sharp knife. 8. Take your onion and add a big handful of fresh parsley to it. 9. Assembly time. Take a warm pitta. Dollop in some tzatziki, then add some doner strips. Spoon in some pickled onion, dollop on a bit more tzatziki, and tuck in!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most comforting dish you #8217;ll ever eat. ## NOTES: Make sure the bacon is nice and crispy before you add your tinned tomatoes. ## COOKING TIME (INCLUDES PREPARATION TIME): 50 MINUTES ## INGREDIENTS: * Parmesan * Mozzarella * 900g Cherry Tomatoes * 200g Spinach * Basil * Garlic * 400g Smoked Bacon Lardons * 500g Gnocchi ## METHOD: 1. Add smoked bacon lardons to a frying pan and cook until crispy. Then add your cherry tomatoes. 2. Cook until they start to burst, and then add 2 chopped cloves of garlic. Stir them in, and then add your spinach and basil leaves. Once they have wilted, mix everything together. Season with salt and pepper. Bubble down the sauce until it is thick and rich. 3.

    <TEXT>The freshest Christmas finger food. ### Notes: Serve with extra cranberry sauce! ### Cooking Time (Including Preparation Time): 1 Hour ### Ingredients: * 60g Grated Cheddar * 400g Pack Sausages * 1 Bay Leaf * 7 Sage Leaves * 1 Apple * 150g Cranberry Sauce * 2 Onions (finely chopped) * 375g Pack Ready Rolled Puff Pastry * 1 Egg #160; * Sesame Seeds ### Method: 1. Preheat oven to 200C/180C fan. 2. Finely chop your sage leaves. Add to a pan with some oil and your bay leaf. Fry until the sage starts to crisp, and then add your onion. 3. Cook until soft, and then remove to the heat. 4. Add your onion to a bowl. Squeeze the meat out of your sausages and add to bowl. Grate an apple, squeeze the gratings to remove excess moisture, and add to bowl. Add your cheddar and season generously with salt and pepper. 5. Mix everything together. 6. Warm the cranberry sauce in a pan with a splash of water. This will loosen it so it spreads more easily. #160; 7. Unravel the sheet of puff pastry. Cut in half lengthways then spread each rectangle with the cranberry sauce. #160; 8. Divide the stuffing mixture in two and spread along the length of each pastry strip in a cylindrical shape leaving a 1cm border. Brush the top of the sausage meat and borders with beaten egg then tightly roll the pastry over the sausage to encase it. Cut into 12 sausage rolls then chill for 15 minutes. 9. Brush the remaining egg over the sausage rolls and sprinkle over the sesame seeds and some sea salt. Bake for 30 minutes until cooked through and deep golden brown. 10. Remove from oven, stack them up and enjoy! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/christmas-stuffing-sausage-rolls**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/christmas-stuffing-sausage-rolls) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Ingredients:** * Turkey * 6 Sausages * 12 Chipolatas * 24 Smoked Streaky bacon rashers * Brussel Sprouts * Potatoes * Carrots 2 per person * Parsnips 2 per person * 3 Onions * 110 g Breadcrumbs * Apple Butter * Goose fat * Garlic * Plain flour * Cranberry sauce * Honey * Red wine * Rosemary * Sage * Tarragon * Parsley * Bay Leaves * Peppercorns * 1 Pint Whole Milk  #8203; **Instructions:** 1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. 2. **Stuffing**, take your large sausages and squeeze the sausage meat out of the skin. Next chop your sage, grate an apple and some soaked breadcrumbs to a mixing bowl and thoroughly mix together. 3. **Turkey!** Place your turkey into a large baking tray and cover with olive oil making sure that you cover the entirety of the bird. Next add a generous amount of salt and pepper and rub into the turkey. Add the ball of stuffing to the cavity of the turkey and place the turkey in the oven for 3 #189; hours (see cooking instructions). The most important part of cooking the turkey is basting. Make sure you set yourself a timer every 30 minutes so you don't forget. 4. **Veg**. Next we can prep our vegetables. First we need to boil the potatoes. 5. Place your halved potatoes into a saucepan and fill with water to bring to the boil. 6. Once the potatoes are soft, take them off the boil and drain them. Place the back into the saucepan with the lid on the top and shake them well for a few seconds. 7. Add a generous amount of goose fat to a baking tray and pour the potatoes into it. 8. Season with salt pepper and a handful of rosemary. 9. Mix together thoroughly so the goose fat covers all of the potatoes. 10. Place in the oven for 1 hour, remembering to shake them every 20 minutes to maintain crispiness. 11. REMINDER: Make sure you baste that turkey!!! 12. Next we #8217;ve got the pigs in blankets. Take the chipolatas and wrap the streaky bacon around the sausages, repeating until this is finished. Spread cranberry sauce over each sausage and place in the oven for 40 minutes. 13. Half an hour before the turkey is ready take the foil off and baste for the last time. 14. Once the turkey is cooked take out of the oven and leave to rest for 30 minutes covering it in foil to retain the heat 15. For the brussel sprouts, quarter and place into a wok. Then add small strips of bacon and fry until the brussels are cooked through. 16. For the parsnips and carrots, cut them into strips and halve them. Add 2 tablespoons of honey and wholegrain mustard and mix together. Spread them across 2 baking trays to make sure they all get cooked properly. Place into the oven for 45 minutes. 17. Time to make the gravy. Take the turkey out of the pan and place onto a low heat. Crumble a chicken stock into the pan. Add red wine, flour and whisk 18. For the bread sauce, peel the onion and stick cloves into the onion. 19. Pour one pint of milk into a saucepan, add the onions, a bay leaf and some peppercorns. 20. Bring to the boil and cover with some tinfoil taking it off the heat to rest. 21. 5 Minutes before serving, remove the bay leaves and sieve the milk catching the peppercorns. 22. Add the milk back to the pan on a low heat. Add a knob of butter and 110g of breadcrumbs. Mix to a nice smooth consistency and serve. 23. Once everything is ready, carve your turkey making sure to remove the stuffing from the cavities and serve. 24. Enjoy! **Website:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenu...**](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fmobkitchenuk%2F%3Fhl%3Den amp;v=MgiQHTRjMqo amp;redir_token=OmhVCMtZDpoiSpcthoXuUxLe_hR8MTU0NDY5ODMzN0AxNTQ0NjExOTM3 amp;event=video_description) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmobkitchen%2F amp;v=MgiQHTRjMqo amp;redir_token=OmhVCMtZDpoiSpcthoXuUxLe_hR8MTU0NDY5ODMzN0AxNTQ0NjExOTM3 amp;event=video_description)</TEXT>

    <TEXT># This recipe was made in collaboration with Calm, Campaign Against Living Miserably. # Ingredients * 70g Porcini Mushrooms * 250g Chestnut Mushrooms * Butter * 1 Onion * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 500g Risotto Rice * 400g Parmesan * Turkey Leftovers * Handful of Parsley * Salt and Pepper # Method 1. Place your Porcini mushrooms into a bowl and add 500ml of boiling water. Leave them to rehydrate. This will also allow you to create your stock. 2. Into a pan add a knob of butter, olive oil and diced onion. Fry onion until soft, and then add crushed garlic. Mix it in, and then pour in your risotto rice. Start adding stock and give it a good stir on a medium heat. Add another 2 spoonfuls and stir thoroughly. Repeat this process gradually as the rice continues to soak up the stock until you have run out of stock. If the rice isn #8217;t cooked through, just start adding water or vegetable stock until it is. 3. Add your grated parmesan and leftover turkey. Mix it in. 4. In a separate pan fry your sliced chestnut mushrooms until brown. 5. Once cooked add them to your risotto, along with your porcini mushrooms, a large handful of chopped parsley, a knob of butter, salt and pepper and tuck in with your MOB. #makethemostofyourleftovers **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mob-x-calm-leftover-turkey-risotto**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mob-x-calm-leftover-turkey-risotto) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The key is in the method, so follow it to the letter. ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 30 Minutes ### Ingredients: * 1kg Maris Piper Potatoes * 4 Tablespoons Goose Fat * A whole Head of Garlic * Bunch of Thyme * Bunch of Rosemary ### Method: 1. Preheat oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. 2. Peel your potatoes and cut into quarters. Add them to a pan of boiling water with a large pinch of salt. Parboil for 10 minutes. 3. While the potatoes are cooking, add 4 tablespoons of goose fat to a roasting tray. Place tray in the oven for 10 minutes, just so the fat can melt and heat through. 4. Drain your potatoes, and then re-add to the pan. Place a lid on top, and then give them a good shake. Remove the lid. The outside of the potatoes should be nice and fluffy. This is KEY to the crispiness. 5. Pour your fluffy potatoes into the roast tray. Add 10-12 whole cloves of garlic (skin on), a large handful of rosemary, a large handful of thyme, a big pinch of salt and some pepper. Toss everything together, and then place the potatoes in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. 6. Next key part - the mid-cook tossing. Every 25 minutes, you need to remove the roasting tray from the oven, and gently turn the potatoes in the goose fat. This will ensure a nice even golden outside. 7. Once the potatoes are gold all over, remove from the oven. Serve with some salt sprinkled on top and enjoy! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/ultimate-roast-potatoes**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/ultimate-roast-potatoes) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**This recipe was sponsored by Elmea. Sponsorships help us keep producing content.**  #8203; Such a good way to use up the leftovers. So, so cheap. Get on it MOB and impress the family. ### Notes: You can really chuck anything in this pie filling - leftover ham, leftover sprouts, leftover stuffing! Get it all in there and enjoy. ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ### Ingredients: * 2 Sheets Puff Pastry * 400g Leftover Turkey Meat * 4 Leeks * Bunch of Tarragon * 100ml Elmlea Double * 300g Smoked Bacon * 4 Tablespoons Plain Flour * 1 Pint Whole Milk * 2 Eggs (for the yolks) ### Method: 1. Finely slice bacon. Add to a large frying pan. Fry until beginning to get crispy. Then add 4 finely sliced leeks to the pan with a tablespoon of olive oil. 2. Fry leeks on a medium heat until soft. Once soft, add you leftover turkey meat. Stir it in, and then add a large handful of chopped tarragon. 3. Mix everything together, and add 4 tablespoons of plain flour. Stir it in to the mixture, so it is all absorbed. Now start adding your milk, bit by bit, mixing it in. After pouring in the full pint of milk you should have a delicious thick pie filling. 4. Elmlea time. Pour in 100ml Elmlea Double to make it extra creamy. Season very generously with lots of pepper and a good pinch of salt. Mix everything together. Your filling should be very thick - if it is too loose, just keep it on the heat until enough moisture has evaporated and the fillings holds it place. 5. Pie time. Roll out your first sheet of puff pastry. Place it on a sheet of baking paper, on a baking tray. Now spoon in your filling, keeping a 2cm border free around the edge. Smooth the filling out with your spoon. Brush egg yolk around the border, and then place your second puff pastry sheet on top (roll it out to make sure it fits with enough overlap. 6. Press the 2 sheets of pastry together around the edge. Cut off any loose bits, and then go around the edges with a fork, pressing it down to create the seal. 7. With a knife, run diagonal lines across the top of the pie to create a lattice effect. Brush it all over with egg yolk. Sprinkle on some sea salt. 8. Place the pie in the oven for 35 minutes or until the pastry is golden. 9. Remove from the oven, slice it up and serve with a big dollop of mustard. Enjoy. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/leftover-turkey-pillow-pie**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/leftover-turkey-pillow-pie) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the dish my Dad would always cook for us when we were growing up. It is without a doubt my death row meal. ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 20 Minutes ### Ingredients: * Capers (2 Tablespoons) * Bunch of Parsley * 7 Anchovies * Large Handful Kalamata Olives * 2 Tins Plum Tomatoes * Chilli Flakes (2 Teaspoons) * 2 Cloves of Garlic (Crushed) * 500g Spaghetti ### Method: 1. Add 7 chopped anchovies and 2 teaspoons of crushed chillies and 6 chopped anchovies into a frying pan with a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of oil from the anchovy tin. Fry for one minute, and then add 2 crushed cloves of garlic and a large handful of chopped parsley stalks. Mix everything together, add your capes, your olives, and pour in 2 tins of plum tomatoes. 2. Break the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon, and then refill both the tins halfway with water and add to the sauce. 3. At this point, put 500g of spaghetti into a pan of boiling water with a large pinch of salt. This should take 10 minutes to cook. 4. Allow sauce to reduce, and just when you are removing the pasta from the heat, season the sauce with salt and pepper and add a large handful of chopped parsley. 5. Drain the pasta, and then pour it back into the saucepan with the puttanesca sauce. Mix everything together and remove from the heat. Serve with some parsley leaves scattered on top, and a good glug of olive oil. Enjoy! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/dads-puttanesca**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/dads-puttanesca) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best route to VC for a 22yo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-05 16:52:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>As title says I'm a 22 year old with a degree from a too 10 UK univeristy, nothing to do with finance or CS. Current plan is to work in startup and maybe an accelerator and eventually do an MBA. Following that either go into a C level role and then begin trying to use my expertise in securing a job at an early stage VC. Does this seem plausible? Or is there a chance of trying to get lucky and land an internship at a VC in the next year or so? Thanks all</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The quickest, creamiest vegan tikka masala about. ### Notes: Make sure your griddle pan is on a very high heat to get some nice char marks on the aubergine. ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ### Ingredients: * 150g Coconut Cream * 3 Aubergines * Garam Masala * Turmeric * Ground Coriander * Chilli Powder * Garlic -  #163;0.30 * 2 Brown Onions * Knob of Ginger * 400g Basmati Rice * 800ml Passata * Tomato Pur #233;e ### Full Recipe: 1. Preheat oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. 2. Cut aubergines into strips. Salt them, leave for 10 minutes and then pat dry (this removes excess moisture). Place aubergine strips into a bowl. Add a teaspoon of turmeric, 2 teaspoons of chilli powder, 2 teaspoons of ground coriander and a teaspoon of garam masala. Season with salt and pepper and mix everything together. 3. Heat a griddle pan. Once very hot, add your aubergines in batches. Cook on a high heat for 3-4 minutes each side until charred. Place the chargrilled aubergine in the oven for 10 #8212;12 minutes just so they can cook through. 4. Time to get on with the curry sauce. Slice up 2 brown onions. Add to a large pan with a good drizzle of olive oil. Cook on a medium heat until the onions are lovely and caramelised. 5. At this point, add a finely chopped clove of garlic and a chopped knob of ginger. Mix them in, and then add half a teaspoon of turmeric, and a teaspoon each of chilli powder, ground coriander and garam masala. Mix everything together, and then add a heaped tablespoon of tomato pur #233;e. 6. Stir the base together, and then pour in 800ml passata. Mix everything together. 7. Add your coconut cream into the curry. Stir it through, and then bring the sauce to the boil. Once it is bubbling, turn it down, and let it simmer and thicken for 2 minutes. Now add your aubergine. Stir them through. Add 300ml water, bring to a simmer and then cover for 15 minutes and cook on a medium heat. 8. Get your rice on (follow pack instructions). 9. Serve the aubergine tikka masala over a bed of steaming rice. Garnish with some chopped coriander.

    <TEXT>I have a face3-to-face interview with a VC for and Intern role.  #8203; They have said that not too much of a comprehensive understanding of the approach is needed, but here is the interview structure:  #8203; "There will be 2 face-to-face interviews with members of the investment team. This will include: * An informal interview to understand more about your experience and potential fit for the role. (30 minutes) * A formal case interview (45mins).

    <TEXT>Hey,  #8203; I have played year-on-year but am fairly average at the game.  #8203; I do Squad Battles every week and get around 11k plus Rival and take around 30k earning me 40k a week.  #8203; At this rate I will need to save for months in order to afford someone like Van Dijk or Kante, so I am just wondering if any of you had any tips that can add up to bringing in more cash?  #8203; Not too fussed about packs, wasted loads on them over the years.  #8203; BONUS QUESTION:  #8203; Who are your favourite PL Players currently and why?

    <TEXT>### Cooking time (including preparation time): 30 minutes ### Ingredients: * 2 Fennel Bulbs #160; * 4 Garlic Cloves * 400g Rigatoni #160; * 100g  #8216;Nduja * Glass White Wine * 4 tbsp Creme Fraiche * 2 Tbsp Capers * 50g Parmesan #160; ### Method: 1. Fill the kettle and boil. Whilst the kettle is boiling slice the fennel bulbs lengthways and slice the garlic. Keep the green fronds for later. #160; 2. Drizzle a good glug of olive oil into a frying pan, add the fennel and cook over a high heat until beginning to caramelise. #160; 3. Once the fennel is caramelised tip the water from the kettle into a large saucepan, salt, tip in the rigatoni and cook according to packet instructions. #160; 4. Meanwhile, break the  #8216;nduja into smaller pieces, straight into the frying pan with the fennel and stir. Once melted add the sliced garlic. Cook for a minute then turn down the heat and pour in the white wine. Leave the sauce to bubble away, until the wine has reduced by half then stir through the capers and creme fraiche. Add a couple of tablespoons of pasta water and mix it together. 5. Drain the pasta straight into the sauce, give everything a good mix together then grate in the parmesan. Ladle into bowls, crack over some black pepper, grate over a little more parmesan and if you are feeling fancy sprinkle over the fennel fronds. Boom. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/nduja-and-fennel-pasta**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/nduja-and-fennel-pasta) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have been working on a beef pie recipe for a while and we think we have cracked a winner. Please give it a go. ### Cooking time (including preparation time): 4 Hours ### Ingredients: * 1 Onion * 2 Carrots #160; * 2 Celery Sticks * 800g Stewing/Braising Steak #160; * 2 Heaped tbsp Plain Flour #160; * 500ml Bottle dark ale (we used a porter) * 500ml Beef Stock #160; * Few Sprigs Thyme * 2 tbsp Brown Sauce #160; * 2 packs ready rolled Shortcrust Pastry #160; * 1 1/2 tbsp English Mustard * 1 Beaten Egg **Method:** 1. Chop the onion, carrot and celery into the same sized pieces. Season the steak generously with salt and pepper and toss in the plain flour so that each piece is evenly coated. 2. Pour a splash of oil into a large saucepan/casserole dish. Over a high heat, fry the steak in batches until evenly browned. Remove onto a plate. 3. Turn down the heat, don #8217;t worry about the pan bottom being brown this is all flavour! Tip in the onion, carrot and celery into the pan. Cook, stirring for 5 minutes until softened then pour in the ale and stock. Stir in the thyme and brown sauce. Scrape the meat back into the pan, Simmer gently on a low heat, uncovered for 2 1/2 hours until you have a very thick pie filling. If the gravy is too thin, remove the meat then bubble the sauce down. Leave to cool - you can do this day before if you want. #160; 4. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan. #160; 5. Pie time. Unravel your first sheet of shortcrust pastry with its paper onto a baking tray. Spread with the mustard then spoon in your filling keeping a 2cm border free around the edge. Smooth the filling over then brush the border with the beaten egg. Place your second shortcrust pastry sheet on top (roll it out first to make sure it fits with enough overlap. #160; 6. Press the two sheets of pastry together around the edge, cut off any messy bits then press down along all the edges with a fork to create a seal. 7. Score the top with a cutlery knife. Don #8217;t press the knife in too far as you don #8217;t want to cut the pastry open. Bake in the oven for 30 mins until deep golden brown. #160; 8. Slice and serve with a dollop of brown sauce, or mustard, or both if you are a maverick. #160; **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes//beef-and-ale-slice-pie**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes//beef-and-ale-slice-pie) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ultimate fried chicken. So quick. So easy. Delicious, crunchy outside. Tender, perfectly cooked chicken on the inside. ### Notes: Use a mixture of chicken thighs and drumsticks on the bone if you don #8217;t want to use legs. Keeping the chicken, skin on and on the bone is the secret to extra juicy fried chicken, it adds flavour and cooks more evenly whilst keeping the batter crisp. ### Cooking time (including preparation time): 1 hour ### Ingredients: * 4 skin on chicken legs (or 8 drumsticks and thighs) * 1 1/2 tbsp fine sea salt #160; * 4 tsp smoked paprika * 4 tsp garlic powder/granules * 4 tsp dried oregano * 4 tsp onion powder/granules * 200g plain flour * 2 tbsp cornflour * 280ml pot buttermilk * 1 egg #160; * Vegetable Oil for frying #160; ### Method: 1. Use a sharp knife to cut the chicken legs in half where the drumstick and thigh meet - you will be able to feel the two knuckle joints with your hands. Measure 1 tbsp salt, 2 tsp smoked paprika,2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp onion powder into a bowl with the chicken pieces. Mix well so that they are all evenly coated then leave at room temp for 30 -45 minutes, depending on how much you time.  #160; 2. Get your dredging station ready. Mix the remaining spices and salt with the plain flour and cornflour in a bowl. In a separate bowl, crack in the egg, whisk then stir in the buttermilk. Have a baking tray ready for your coated chicken. #160; 3. One by one, dip the chicken pieces first in the buttermilk mixture, then in the flour mixture, making sure each piece is completely covered. Transfer to the tray. 4. Fill the biggest deep heavy bottomed saucepan you have half full with oil. Put over a medium heat to maintain a steady temperature and then heat until shimmering. To test that the oil is ready, mix a tsp of the leftover buttermilk with the flour to make a craggy dough. Drop it into the oil and you are looking for it to brown, puff up and rise to the surface in a minute - any quicker and the oil is too hot. 5. Starting with a tester, fry the chicken in batches for 10-14 minutes, turning once half way through until super crispy. Check the first one to make sure the chicken is cooked through. If the chicken browns too quickly but isn #8217;t cooked all the way through you will need to turn the temperature down on the oil. If you have a thermometer you want it to be 160C. The temperature will drop once the cold chicken goes in so keep adjusting the heat. Don #8217;t cook more than 3 pieces at once. #160; 6. Transfer the fried chicken to wire rack over a tray lined with kitchen roll.

    <TEXT>The ultimate fried chicken. So quick. So easy. Delicious, crunchy outside. Tender, perfectly cooked chicken on the inside. ### Notes: Use a mixture of chicken thighs and drumsticks on the bone if you don #8217;t want to use legs. Keeping the chicken, skin on and on the bone is the secret to extra juicy fried chicken, it adds flavour and cooks more evenly whilst keeping the batter crisp. ### Cooking time (including preparation time): 1 hour ### Ingredients: * 4 skin on chicken legs (or 8 drumsticks and thighs) * 1 1/2 tbsp fine sea salt #160; * 4 tsp smoked paprika * 4 tsp garlic powder/granules * 4 tsp dried oregano * 4 tsp onion powder/granules * 200g plain flour * 2 tbsp cornflour * 280ml pot buttermilk * 1 egg #160; * Vegetable Oil for frying #160; ### Method: 1. Use a sharp knife to cut the chicken legs in half where the drumstick and thigh meet - you will be able to feel the two knuckle joints with your hands. Measure 1 tbsp salt, 2 tsp smoked paprika,2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp onion powder into a bowl with the chicken pieces. Mix well so that they are all evenly coated then leave at room temp for 30 -45 minutes, depending on how much you time.  #160; 2. Get your dredging station ready. Mix the remaining spices and salt with the plain flour and cornflour in a bowl. In a separate bowl, crack in the egg, whisk then stir in the buttermilk. Have a baking tray ready for your coated chicken. #160; 3. One by one, dip the chicken pieces first in the buttermilk mixture, then in the flour mixture, making sure each piece is completely covered. Transfer to the tray. 4. Fill the biggest deep heavy bottomed saucepan you have half full with oil. Put over a medium heat to maintain a steady temperature and then heat until shimmering. To test that the oil is ready, mix a tsp of the leftover buttermilk with the flour to make a craggy dough. Drop it into the oil and you are looking for it to brown, puff up and rise to the surface in a minute - any quicker and the oil is too hot. 5. Starting with a tester, fry the chicken in batches for 10-14 minutes, turning once half way through until super crispy. Check the first one to make sure the chicken is cooked through. If the chicken browns too quickly but isn #8217;t cooked all the way through you will need to turn the temperature down on the oil. If you have a thermometer you want it to be 160C. The temperature will drop once the cold chicken goes in so keep adjusting the heat. Don #8217;t cook more than 3 pieces at once. #160; 6.

    <TEXT>### Cooking time (including preparation time): 5.5 Hours ### Ingredients: * 1kg #160;pork #160;shoulder #160; * 4 tbsp soft light brown sugar * 1 tbsp smoked paprika #160; * 500ml apple cider * 200ml ketchup * 75ml apple cider vinegar plus 2 tbsp #160; * 3 tbsp soy sauce #160; * tabasco * 1 red onion #160; * 1 small white cabbage * 2 carrots #160; * 6 tbsp mayonnaise * Gherkins #160; * 4 brioche burger buns #160; ### Method: 1. Preheat the oven to 160C/140C fan. Rub the #160;pork #160;shoulder all over with the paprika, 1 tbsp sugar and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Put into a roasting dish or a casserole dish with a lid, pour in the apple cider then cover with tinfoil/lid and cook for 5 hours until shreddable with two forks. #160; 2. Meanwhile make the BBQ sauce. Measure the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, remaining 3 tbsp sugar and a good few dashes of tabasco with 200ml water into a pan. Bring to the boil and then add 150 of the pork juices from the roasting tray. Add a heaped teaspoon of smoked paprika, then simmer, stirring regularly for 10 minutes until thickened. Leave to cool completely - you want the BBQ sauce to be tangy to cut through the #160;pork #160;later. #160; 3. Next make the slaw. Finely slice the red onion, shred the cabbage and carrots. Mix with the mayonnaise, 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 2 tbsp pickling liquor from the gherkin jar. Season to taste. #160; 4. Once your #160;pork #160;is cooked, tip out the liquid into a jug, pour off any fat. #160;Pull #160;then #160;pork #160;with two forks then add 3/4 of the BBQ sauce and mix well to combine with a splash of cooking liquor to taste. Cut the buns in half, toasting if you like. Spoon in a dollop of the remaining BBQ sauce followed by the #160;pulled #160;pork, a big handful of slaw and some sliced gherkins. Serve with the remaining slaw on the side. #160;Pulled #160;pork #160;done. #160; **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/pulled-pork-burger**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/pulled-pork-burger) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Yes, we used the WET HAND DRY HAND METHOD. We hope this makes you happy.**  #8203; The easiest homemade marmite chicken. ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 25 Minutes ### Ingredients: * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 8 Skinless, Boneless Chicken Thighs * Cornflour * 3 Eggs * Vegetable Oil (For Frying) * Marmite (2.5 Tbsps) * Rice Wine Vinegar (6 Tbsps) * Soy Sauce (5 Tbsps) * Honey (3.5 Tbsps) * Basmati Rice * Spring Onions (Chopped, for garnish ### Method: 1. Cut your chicken in to mouth size chunks 2. Get 2 bowls out. Crack your eggs in to one of them. Whisk them up with some salt and pepper. Add your cornflour to the other bowl. 3. Dip you chicken in the flour, then the egg, then the flour, so it is evenly coated. 4. Get a wok on the heat, with a large splash of vegetable oil. Fry your chicken in batches, for 4-5 minutes per batch. You want the chicken to begin to start browning and puff up. At this point, remove it from the wok and set aside. 5. Get your rice on (follow pack instructions) 6. Drain your wok and wash it completely. Dry, and place back on the heat. 7. Add a small splash of vegetable oil. Grate in 2 garlic cloves. Fry for 20 seconds, and just as it starts to brown, add your soy sauce, vinegar, honey and marmite. Then add 6 tablespoons of water. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes until it starts to thicken. 8. Remove any scuzz with a spoon. Then, add 1.5 tsps of cornflour to a glass. Pour in 50ml water, and mix it together. Pour your cornflour flurry in to the sauce. Mix it in. Once it starts to thicken, place your chicken back in the wok. 9. Stir it through the sauce, and cook on a medium heat, while gently stirring, for 3 minutes. 10. Serve your chicken on your steaming rice. Garnish with chopped spring onions.

    <TEXT>I am looking at some of the core functions of Venture Capital funds, and I was just wondering aside from capital, what key resources VC's might typically offer early-stage companies?  #8203; I am thinking Seed-Series A. How many resources (and what would they typically be) will be expected to come from the GP's, and how much is expected to fall within the budget raised during the most recent round?  #8203; Thank you for your time and I look forward to your responses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A family special. Made PERFECT by Old Man Lebus himself. Cheap, Quick and Easy! Serves 4 People Cooking Time: 20 Minutes INGREDIENTS * Pinch of Salt * Olive Oil * Black Pepper * 1 Pack of Smoked Streaky Bacon * 1 Large Brown Onion * 1 25ml Glass of White Wine (Optional) * 2 Tins of Plum Tomatoes (400g each) * 500g of Bucatini Pasta * 2 Teaspoons of Chilli Flakes  #8203; RECIPE 1. First, heat your non-stick pan on a medium heat. Then grab your Bacon and start slicing it into bite-sized chunks. Once you #8217;ve done this, take your Bacon and add it to the pan, frying until nice and crispy. Followed by chopping your Onion and mixing it in with the Bacon. 2. Once they #8217;re mixed in, fry them off a little bit before adding Two Teaspoons of Chilli flakes. 3. Next up is the 25ml of White Wine, although optional, it brings a nice depth and richness to the sauce. 4. Once the wine has evaporated and the onions are translucent, it #8217;s time to add two tins of Plum Tomatoes. 5. Immediately followed by filling up both tins with cold water and pouring that into the pan. Begin breaking those Tomatoes up and stirring them in with the bacon and onion. 6. While the sauce is bubbling away, begin with your pasta. Take 500g of Bucatini Pasta (Linguine is an alternative) and boil it in finely seasoned Salted Water for 8-9 minutes. 7. Once your sauce is nice and thick, take your Black Pepper and generously grind it into the sauce. 8. Turn off the heat and take your pasta and add it to the pan, mixing thoroughly with the sauce. 9. Finally, give the mix a small drizzle of Olive Oil to separate the starchy pasta and the fat. Serve and Enjoy!  #8203; **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenu...**](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=eAkBnW6abvDK_AG1xFHkEd04q9R8MTU1MjY1NDk1OUAxNTUyNTY4NTU5 amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fmobkitchenuk%2F%3Fhl%3Den amp;v=vk7anN8PmGE amp;event=video_description) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=eAkBnW6abvDK_AG1xFHkEd04q9R8MTU1MjY1NDk1OUAxNTUyNTY4NTU5 amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmobkitchen%2F amp;v=vk7anN8PmGE amp;event=video_description)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This dish is out of this world. ## Cooking time (Includes preparation time): 4 hours ## Notes: This beef barbacoa is exceptionally good for burritos. Add some cooked rice to your tortillas to soak up all the tasty sauce. ## Ingredients: * 2 Red Onions * 6 Cloves Garlic * 2 Tomatoes * 2 Tsp Cumin Seeds * 1 Tsp Smoked Paprika * 1 Tsp Oregano * 2 Tbsp Chipotle Paste * 50ml Veg Oil * 2 Limes * 1kg Beef Brisket * 500ml chicken stock * Pinch of Sugar * Tortillas, to serve (plus guac, rice, salsa, sour cream - whatever you fancy) ## Method: 1. Preheat the oven to 160 #176;C/140 #176;C fan. 2. Cut 1 red onion into wedges, peel the garlic cloves. Put both in a dry frying pan along with the tomatoes. Fry over a very high heat until blackened - don #8217;t be scared about them charring - this is what makes the unreal smoky flavour later. 3. Tip the red onion, garlic and tomatoes into a food processor. Add the cumin seeds, paprika, oregano, chipotle paste, veg oil and juice of 1 lime then blitz together to make the barbacoa sauce. 4. Cut the brisket into chunky pieces then season generously with sea salt and pepper. Pour a drizzle of oil into a casserole dish then fry the beef in batches until evenly browned on all sides. Return all the beef to the pan, pour in the chicken stock then scrape in the barbacoa sauce. Give everything a good mix, bring to the boil then put a lid on and transfer to the oven. Roast for 2 hours then take the lid off and continue to cook the meat for 1- 1/2 hours until the meat is completely falling apart. 5. Thinly slice the remaining red onion, pour over the juice of the remaining lime. Add a good pinch of sugar and salt then scrunch the onions with your hands - this will encourage them to soften. Leave for 10 minutes to quick pickle. 6. Shred the beef into its sauce - season to taste. Serve with the quick pickled onions, tortillas and whatever else you like. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/beefbarbacoa**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/beefbarbacoa) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The burger game has changed. ## Cooking time (Includes preparation time): 35 minutes ## Notes: If you like spice add some extra sriracha to the mayo. ## Ingredients: * 480g Skinless Boneless Salmon * 2 Tbsp White Miso * 1 Lime, Zest and Juice * 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce * 50g Panko Breadcrumbs * 1 Cucumber * 1 Tsp Salt * 2 Garlic Cloves * 2 Tbsp Sriracha * 1 Tsp Caster Sugar * 3 Tbsp Mayonnaise * 4 Brioche Buns * Knob of Ginger Method: 1. For the salmon burgers roughly chop the salmon fillets. Put half into a food processor and blitz to a paste then add the miso, ginger, lime zest, rest of the salmon and 1 tbsp soy sauce. Pulse very briefly until roughly combined. You want some nice chunky bits of salmon in with the paste rather than it all turned into mush. Tip the mix into a bowl then stir through the panko breadcrumbs. Shape into four burgers and chill whilst you make the smacked cucumbers. 2. Now the fun part. Get a rolling pin or something heavy and hit the cucumber until it has collapsed and starts to break. Cut into random diagonal pieces then put into a bowl and mix in the salt. Leave to sit for 10 minutes to draw out some of the water from the cucumber. 3. In a separate bowl make the dressing. Crush in the garlic cloves then mix with 1 tbsp hot sauce, remaining 1 tbsp soy sauce, sugar and lime juice. Mix the remaining hot sauce into the mayonnaise. 4. Pour a drizzle of oil into a non stick frying pan. Fry the salmon burgers for 3 minutes on each side. 5. Assembly time. Drain the water off the cucumbers and mix with the dressing. Cut the buns in half, toast in the frying pan if you like, then spread the bottom of each bun with the sriracha mayo. Top each with a salmon burger and then pile on the smacked cucumber slaw, drizzling over the dressing. Bam. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/misosalmonburgers**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/misosalmonburgers) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

Maybe these "stupid" people are happy to accept free content, with the knowledge that promotions (which I cant see within this recipe) enable it to remain free to them. Have a good week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ultimate sweetcorn fritters, the ginger and the lemon grass make for a perfect combo. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 minutes ## Notes: Add some fresh chillies to your guac if you like a spicy hit. ## Ingredients: * 1 Fat Lemongrass Stick * Small Bunch of Coriander * 2 Avocados * 2 Limes * Big Knob of Ginger * 1 x 325g Can Sweetcorn, Drained * 50g Self-Raising Flour * 2 Tbsp Milk * 1/2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper (plus extra to serve) * 10 Eggs * 225g Pack Halloumi, Sliced Method: 1. Remove the tough outer layer and end off of the lemongrass stick, chop as finely as you can. Finely slice the coriander stalks and roughly chop the leaves. 2. Using a fork smash the avocados in a bowl, add 3/4 coriander leaves. Season with salt, pepper and lime juice to taste. 3. Scrape the coriander stalks and lemongrass into a bowl. Grate in your ginger then add the drained sweetcorn, flour, milk, cayenne, 2 beaten eggs and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Beat well to form your sweetcorn batter. 4. Put the oven on low and get a deep pan of water on to boil. Pour a drizzle of oil into a non stick frying pan. Dollop four fritters into the pan, using up half the batter. Fry on a medium heat or 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a baking tray and repeat with the remaining batter. Keep all the fritters warm in a low oven. 5. Egg time. Carefully crack two of your eggs into two glasses. With a fork or a whisk, create a little whirlpool in the water. Pour the eggs into the water, not into the centre of the whirlpool, but on the edge. With the water, fold the white over the yolk and the egg should form a nice little ball. 6. Cook for 2 1/2 minutes on a medium heat, you want it to be a rolling boil rather than spluttering. To check if it #8217;s done, just gently lift the egg with a slotted spoon. If the white is still a bit wobbly, leave it for 10 more seconds. If it #8217;s firm, remove from the heat. Repeat with the remaining eggs. 7. Fry the halloumi in the pan you used for your fritters until golden and crisp then its time to assemble. Place two sweetcorn fritters on each plate. Top with the smashed avo, halloumi, poached egg. Sprinkle over a little cayenne, the coriander and serve with the lime wedges. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/sweetcorn-fritters**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/sweetcorn-fritters) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the freshest tuna bean pasta, perfect for any occasion. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 25 Minutes ## Notes: This pasta uses the bean water from the tinned cannellini beans to give the sauce full flavour and extra creaminess. ## Ingredients: * 2 Tins of Tuna * 2 Tins of Cannellini Beans * 1 Jar of Pitted Green Olives * Handful of Capers * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 2 Tbsp Chilli Flakes * 2 Bunches of Parsley * 400g of Spaghetti * 1 Lemon * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. First, drizzle the olive oil into a pan on a medium heat and finely chop the parsley to add with the chilli flakes. Slice the garlic into thin discs and add them in. Once the garlic has started to cook, add and mix in the olives and capers. Pour the cannellini beans, INCLUDING the bean water into the pan and mix. 2. In a separate saucepan, cook the spaghetti (see pack instructions). Add about a cup of the pasta water to the olive-bean mix to thicken up the sauce. 3. Break the tuna into chunks and add to the sauce with another bunch of finely chopped parsley. Add the zest of a whole lemon to the sauce to make it taste extra fresh and to bring out the chilli #8217;s flavour. Add salt and pepper to taste. Finally, add your cooked spaghetti and fold in to sauce, top with more chilli flakes and more chopped parsley and tuck in. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/tuna-bean-pasta**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/tuna-bean-pasta) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A tasty twist on the traditional carbonara. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 25 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you add lots of black pepper to this recipe. ## Ingredients: * 200g of Asparagus * 5 Eggs * 100g of Parmesan * 1 Lemon * 300g of Bacon * 1 Bunch of Thyme * 3 Bulbs of Garlic * 400g of Linguine * Salt * Pepper * Olive oil ## Method: 1. Firstly, slice your asparagus in half, down the long side of the stalk. Grill your asparagus until charred both sides. Meanwhile, start cooking your linguine (see pack instructions). 2. Separate the yolks from the eggs and put them in a separate bowl. Add salt, pepper, Parmesan and the zest of a whole lemon to your egg yolks and mix until combined. 3. Dice your bacon and fry in olive oil until cooked. Chop the thyme finely and slice the garlic into thin discs. Add the grilled asparagus with the thyme and garlic followed by a cup of pasta water. Next, drain the linguine (but save the pasta water) and add to the pan, followed by the egg mix. Toss the contents of your pan with tongs to make sure everything is mixed evenly and the creamy sauce is smooth. Stir in another cup of pasta water for extra creaminess. Dish up and get stuck in! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/asparagus-carbonara**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/asparagus-carbonara) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Petit pois are not a variety of pea but peas that are picked before fully maturing, thus remaining smaller than regular peas and tasting sweeter. Not a question of being French or Douchey, just a distinct difference in ingredients. You'd want us to distinguish between onions and shallots, no difference here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The perfect salad for the upcoming Bank Holiday Weekend. ## Cooking Time (Including Preparation Time): 40 Minutes ## Notes: You can use any blue cheese you want, but Saint Agur is our cheese of choice. ## Ingredients: * 6 Cobs of Corn * 1 Chorizo Sausage * 1 Bunch of Spring Onions * 3 Sweet Peppers * 1 Gem Lettuce * 1 Handful of Whole Almonds * Red Wine Vinegar * Parsley * Saint Agur Blue Cheese * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Pre-heat your oven to 180 #176;C. First, place your cobs of corn in a baking dish, cover in olive oil, salt and pepper and bake for 40 minutes. Meanwhile, break apart the chorizo sausage into a non-stick pan and stir until cooked, then remove the chorizo into a bowl and leave aside. Chop your spring onions into even sized piece and cook in the leftover chorizo fat. Add the chorizo back into the pan and stir in with the onions. 2. Slice your sweet peppers into rings, and slice the lettuce. Roughly chop the almonds. Remove the corn from the oven and use a knife to slice the corn off the cob. Now, add all of your ingredients into a large bowl. Break your Saint Agur into chunks, finely chop your parsley and cover the bowl in both. 3. Dressing time. In a jar, mix olive oil with red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. Shake well with the lid on to ensure the dressing is fully mixed. Drizzle this all over your salad bowl. With tongs, toss the salad, making sure all the ingredients are combined. Dish up with extra Saint Agur and get stuck in. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/charred-corn-salad**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/charred-corn-salad) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ultimate pitta has landed, you are going to love this one MOB. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Notes: Add an extra chilli if you like the heat. ## Ingredients: * 600g of Diced Chicken Thighs * 4 Cloves of Garlic * 4 Tbsp of Soy Sauce * 400ml of Coconut Milk * 5 Tbsp of Peanut Butter * Olive Oil * 1 Red Chilli * 1 Red Cabbage * 1 Carrot * Bunch of Coriander * Bunch of Mint * 1 Mango * Salt * 2 Tbsp of Vinegar * Handful of Peanuts ## Method: 1. Start by slicing up your chicken and placing it into a mixing bowl. Finely chop 2 cloves of garlic and add this to the bowl followed by 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 100ml of coconut milk, 1 tbsp of peanut butter and a glug of olive oil. Mix everything together and leave to marinate for 20 minutes (or longer if you have time). 2. Into a small bowl, add the remaining peanut butter, soy sauce and coconut milk. Finely chop the rest of garlic and your chilli and add this to the bowl and mix together until you have a creamy satay sauce. 3. Slaw time. Grate your cabbage and carrot and place them into a large bowl. Finely chop your coriander and mint and add this to the bowl. Slice up your mango and whack it in. Next, sprinkle a pinch of salt, followed by your vinegar and mix everything together thoroughly. 4. Start toasting your pittas. 5. Once your chicken is marinated, add to a lightly oiled frying pan and stir until cooked through. 6. Assembly time! Take your pitta and cut it open. Start with the chicken, then dollop some satay sauce over the top. Stuff the pitta with some of that crunchy slaw. Add some more satay sauce and top with a sprinkling of peanuts. Repeat 4 times and tuck into this delightful little pitta. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/chicken-satay-pittas**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/chicken-satay-pittas) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

Finely chop 2 cloves of garlic and add this to the bowl followed by 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 100ml of coconut milk, 1 tbsp of peanut butter and a glug of olive oil. Mix everything together and leave to marinate for 20 minutes (or longer if you have time). 2. Into a small bowl, add the remaining peanut butter, soy sauce and coconut milk. Finely chop the rest of garlic and your chilli and add this to the bowl and mix together until you have a creamy satay sauce. 3. Slaw time. Grate your cabbage and carrot and place them into a large bowl. Finely chop your coriander and mint and add this to the bowl. Slice up your mango and whack it in. Next, sprinkle a pinch of salt, followed by your vinegar and mix everything together thoroughly. 4. Start toasting your pittas. 5. Once your chicken is marinated, add to a lightly oiled frying pan and stir until cooked through. 6. Assembly time! Take your pitta and cut it open. Start with the chicken, then dollop some satay sauce over the top. Stuff the pitta with some of that crunchy slaw. Add some more satay sauce and top with a sprinkling of peanuts. Repeat 4 times and tuck into this delightful little pitta.

    <TEXT>From Founder Ben Lebus: Hey redditors, I am the chef in the MOB videos. For anyone using this video, there was a mistake in the edit. 2 tablespoons of fish sauce were added to the chicken marinade, and 1 tablespoon of fish sauce was added to the peanut dripping sauce. And the grated vegetable that goes in to the dripping sauce is ginger, not garlic. Please forgive the error, very sloppy. And hope you enjoy the recipe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most fragrant and creamy curry in the land. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: Making the paste from scratch really makes this dish. If you can #8217;t find galangal, just add a little extra ginger. ## Ingredients: * 4 Skinless, Boneless Chicken Thighs * 4 Large Potatoes * 400ml of Coconut Milk * 1 Brown Onion * Handful of Dry Roasted Peanuts * 1 Tsp of Onion Powder * 2 Tsp of Sugar * 4 Tbsp of Soy Sauce * 3 Shallots * 1 Clove of Garlic * 2 Tsp of Chilli Powder * 100g of Galangal * Knob of Ginger * 2 Stalks of Lemongrass * 2 Tsp of Coriander Seeds * 2 Tsp of Ground Cumin * 1 Star Anise * Small Piece of Cinnamon * 1 Tsp of Cloves * 1 Tsp of Cardamom (Ground) * 3 Kaffir Lime Leaves * Black Pepper * 1 Tsp Turmeric (Ground or Whole) * 400g of Rice ## Method: 1. Peel and cut your potatoes into quarters and boil for around 25 minutes. 2. Start by making your paste. Slice up your shallots and lemongrass. Add this to a blender along with your garlic, chilli powder, galangal, ginger, coriander seeds, cumin, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, kaffir lime leaf, pepper and turmeric. Add a good glug of olive oil. Blend until smooth. 3. Get your rice on (see pack instructions). 4. Once blended into a paste, pour a drizzle of olive oil into a hot wok. Spoon in your Massaman paste and stir. Once you can start to smell the aromas from the paste, pour in your coconut milk. Refill the can with water and pour it into the wok. Bring the pan to the boil and add your chicken, your cooked potatoes, sugar, onion powder, onion and soy sauce. Allow the curry to reduce on a medium-low heat until you have a nice thick sauce. 5. When the curry has reduced, add your peanuts and you are ready to serve on a bed of rice. Top with a sprinkle of peanuts and tuck into this delicious Thai classic.  #8203; **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/massaman-curry**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/massaman-curry) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The creamiest and easiest gnocchi about. One-pan, so no mess! ## Cooking Time (Including Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: The red wine vinegar really adds depth to this dish, so do not forget it! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients * 1 Ring of Chorizo * 1 Red Pepper * 1 Orange Pepper * 250g Cherry Tomatoes * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 1 Red Chilli * 400g of Gnocchi * 1.5 tbsp of Red Wine Vinegar * 1 Heaped Tbsp of Mascarpone * 1 Bunch of Basil * Salt * Pepper * Parmesan (optional) ## Method: 1. Break your chorizo ring into small chunks and begin to fry in a large pan. Chop your peppers into cubes and add them to the pan, stirring them and allowing them to fry in the chorizo fat. Once the chorizo and peppers begin to cook, add your cherry tomatoes whole. Stir these and continue to cook on a high heat. Next, slice your red chilli and your garlic and add them to the pan. Continue to cook. 2. In a separate bowl, cover your gnocchi with boiling water and allow it to soak for 10 minutes. 3. While the gnocchi is soaking, pour the red wine vinegar into the frying pan and stir it in with the mascarpone. You should now have a creamy chorizo, pepper and tomato sauce. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Roughly chop your basil and throw that in there too. 4. Drain your gnocchi and mix it in to your sauce well. Serve up with a sprinkling of parmesan and some more fresh basil.

    <TEXT>The perfect way to use up the rest of that sweet baba. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: The beauty of this dish is that it can be served hot or cold, so it #8217;s the perfect addition to your summer BBQ! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Bulb of Garlic * 4 Aubergines * 400g Rigatoni * 1 Tbsp of Tahini * 1 Lemon * 1 Bunch of Basil * 20g Pine Nuts * 210g Kalamata Olives * 80g Pomegranate Seeds * 1 Bunch of Mint * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Place the garlic bulb onto a tray and place in the oven for 30 minutes. 3. As the garlic is cooking, char the aubergines on a gas stove. As the aubergines begin to cook, the skin will start to blacken. Once the skin is completely charred and black, remove the aubergines and place them in a bowl of ice cold water. 4. As the aubergines cool, the skin will become loose, allowing you to peel away the charred skin easily from the aubergine, leaving only the middle. 5. Get the pasta on (see pack instructions). 6. Chop the ends off the peeled aubergines and place them in a bowl. Remove the garlic bulb from the oven. Take one clove of garlic at a time and squeeze the inside of each clove from its skin (this should be easy because they are cooked). Once you have squeezed each clove, combine the aubergine and the garlic with a fork, mashing it up. Add tahini, the juice of a lemon, a large glug of olive oil and a sprinkling of pepper before mixing again. Roughly chop up the basil and sprinkle on top. Give your Baba Ganoush a final mix before setting aside. 7. Once your pasta is cooked, drain, setting a little pasta water aside. Combine the pasta with the Baba Ganoush mixture, stirring well. In a separate pan, lightly toast the pine nuts and add this to the mixture along with the kalamata olives and two thirds of the pomegranate seeds. 8. Roughly chop up the mint, adding two thirds to the pasta mixture along with the remaining pasta water and a sprinkling of salt and pepper in order to loosen the sauce slightly, giving it a silky consistency. 9. Serve by sprinkling the remaining mint and pomegranate seeds over the top of each bowl.  #8203; **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/2019/6/21/baba-ganoush-pasta-salad**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/2019/6/21/baba-ganoush-pasta-salad) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most delicious MOB recipe yet #8230; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 20 Minutes ## Notes: It might be more expensive, but heading to your local fishmongers to source the crab is totally worth it for this dish. Treat yourself MOB. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 200g Fennel * Bunch of Parsley * 2 Red Chillies * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 5 Anchovies * 200ml White Wine * 400g Linguine * 1 Lemon * 200g Brown Crab Meat * 300g White Crab Meat * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Begin with the fennel. Chop off the fronds so that you are left with just the bulb. Then, slice the bulb into wafer thin slices, almost like shavings. Fill a large bowl with ice and water, then place your sliced fennel into the bowl for 20 minutes. 2. Finely chop the parsley, including the stalks. Slice the garlic cloves into thin discs and chop the chillies as finely as possible (with the seeds). Remove the anchovies from the jar, saving the oil for later. Finely slice, then set these ingredients aside. 3. Into a large frying pan place the chopped garlic, parsley stalks, the oil from the anchovies and a large glug of olive oil. Just before the garlic starts to go brown, add in the white wine, mix well. 4. Meanwhile, get the linguine on (see pack instructions). Remember to save a cup of the pasta water for later. 5. Back to the sauce. After the mixture has been bubbling for five minutes, stir in the brown crab meat. Combine thoroughly, so that the crab disintegrates into a brown liquid. Add the pasta water and stir. 6. Once the linguine is cooked, pour into the pan, tossing so that the pasta is completely coated. Then add the white crab meat, the chopped red chilli and the remaining parsley, stirring well. 7. Over the top of the pasta mixture squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, before sprinkling in a large pinch of salt and pepper. One last stir and the pasta is ready to plate up. 8. Strain the fennel, setting aside. Spoon the pasta mixture into a serving bowl. Top with a handful of iced fennel, another sprinkle of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Then - tuck in! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/crab-linguine**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/crab-linguine) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ultimate risotto for the leek loving MOB. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 Minutes ## Notes: Never put oil in when cooking pancetta as it releases its own fats! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 400g Arborio Rice * 4 Leeks * 300g of Cubed Pancetta * 175ml White Wine * 100g Butter * 2 Brown Onions * 1L of Chicken Stock * 250g Parmesan * Bunch of Parsley * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Place the pancetta into a pan and begin to fry on a medium heat until it becomes crispy. Remove the meat from the pan, leaving the fats. 2. Chop up your leeks into small discs, then add to the pan with the pancetta fat. Fry on a medium heat, allowing the leeks to soften. Once soft, add the glass of wine and stir well. Now set the them aside. 3. Into the same pan add half of the butter. Finely chop the onion, then place into the pan and begin to fry gently. Once the onion is translucent, add the arborio rice, making sure you stir and combine thoroughly. 4. Next step: the stirring. Into the mixture add one third of your stock, stirring as you pour. Keep stirring the risotto until the rice has absorbed all the liquid and the mixture is sticky. At this point, add another cup of stock, repeating the stirring process. This cycle is to be repeated until all the stock has been absorbed. The consistency of the risotto should now be thick and creamy. Feel free to try to risotto, to ensure the rice is al dente (if you run out of stock and its not ready, simply add some boiling hot water). 5. Now that the rice is cooked, add the leeks and pancetta back into the pan, combining well. Grate the parmesan and finely chop the parsley. Then add two thirds of both to the pan, along with the rest of the butter and large sprinkling of pepper. Stir well. 6. Time to plate up. Spoon the risotto into a serving bowl. Top with the a sprinkle of the remaining parmesan and parsley, some salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.

    <TEXT>And how many of those deadline day signings did we actually use? Seri, Schurrle, Le Marchand, Bryan, Mitrovic, Anguissa (players we used) came before the deadline. I don't understand why everyone thinks our squad squeezed in at the last second. Villa have done, in my opinion, exactly what we did last season. No Prem experience and a bunch of "sensible" signings on paper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The chip game has changed. This is the perfect snack for any occasion, very simple and super tasty. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Notes: You can try out any of your other favourite dips with this recipe ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Bulb of Garlic * 100g of Mayonnaise * 100g of Plain Yoghurt * Bunch of Mint * 3 Tsp of Chipotle Paste * 5 Tbsp of Plain Flour * 100ml of Chilled Soda Water * 2 Courgettes * Salt * Pepper * Vegetable Oil (Enough to fill the frying pan) ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. To make your garlic aioli dip, start by wrapping your garlic up in foil and placing it into the oven for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, add your mayo to a small bowl. Once the garlic is roasted, squeeze out the garlic using the back of a teaspoon so you are left with the roasted garlic cloves. Run a knife over the top to get rid of any lumps and add this to your mayo. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and mix well. 3. For your chipotle dip, pour your yoghurt into a bowl, add a sprinkle of salt and a grinding of pepper over the top. Thinly, chop up your mint adding three quarters of it to the yoghurt. Mix together. Add your chipotle paste to the top and skim your teaspoon over the top to get a swirly effect. 4. Chip time. Take a frying pan and heat your vegetable oil, until it is bubbling. While it #8217;s heating up, into a bowl, add your flour and soda water and mix together throughly until it is a liquid. Take your courgettes and chop them up into small rectangles. Take each piece and coat it in the flour and soda water mixture. Once the oil is ready, add your coated courgettes to the pan and fry until golden brown. 5. Once the courgette chips are brown, take them out of the pan and serve with the remaining chopped mint and a sprinkling of salt. Dip into those tasty dips and enjoy.

    <TEXT>If you nail this recipe, you #8217;ll never have stodgy rice again! ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 minutes ## Notes: The cooking time seems long but flies by whilst you cook the rest of your dish. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 240g Tilda Basmati Rice ## Method: 1. Weigh 60g of rice per portion. 2. Rinse the grains thoroughly, until the water runs clear. This helps to remove the starch from the grains. 3. Soak the rice for 30 minutes for best results. Soaking helps the grains cook for longer. #160;This is worth doing if you have the time even if you soak until the grains become fully white and opaque. Soaking will also help to remove any starch still on the grains. 4. Drain the rice thoroughly and measure twice as much water to rice. The key is that you follow the measurement of 1 part rice to 2 parts water. 5. Use a saucepan with a lid. Add the rice and water but keep the lid off for now. #160; 6. Bring the rice and water to a boil and then turn down to a light simmer. 7. Put the lid on and gently simmer the rice for 12 minutes. Do not be tempted to stir the grains and keep the lid on. 8. Remove from the heat and let the grains steam, standing for 3 minutes. 9. Fork through the grains gently and serve with your favourite MOB dish and get stuck in! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-perfect-rice**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-perfect-rice) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you nail this recipe, you #8217;ll never have stodgy rice again! ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 minutes ## Notes: The cooking time seems long but flies by whilst you cook the rest of your dish. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 240g Tilda Basmati Rice ## Method: 1. Weigh 60g of rice per portion. 2. Rinse the grains thoroughly, until the water runs clear. This helps to remove the starch from the grains. 3. Soak the rice for 30 minutes for best results. Soaking helps the grains cook for longer. #160;This is worth doing if you have the time even if you soak until the grains become fully white and opaque. Soaking will also help to remove any starch still on the grains. 4. Drain the rice thoroughly and measure twice as much water to rice. The key is that you follow the measurement of 1 part rice to 2 parts water. 5. Use a saucepan with a lid. Add the rice and water but keep the lid off for now. #160; 6. Bring the rice and water to a boil and then turn down to a light simmer. 7. Put the lid on and gently simmer the rice for 12 minutes. Do not be tempted to stir the grains and keep the lid on. 8. Remove from the heat and let the grains steam, standing for 3 minutes. 9. Fork through the grains gently and serve with your favourite MOB dish and get stuck in! **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-perfect-rice**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-perfect-rice) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Such a delicious, filling dish. ### Notes: The longer you can leave the ragu, the better. ### Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 15 Minutes ### Ingredients: * 800g Gnocchi * 1 Brown Onion * 2 Celery Sticks * 2 Carrots * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 3 Skinned Pork Sausages * 400g Beef Mince * 200g Chorizo * 200ml Red Wine * 2 Tins Chopped Tomatoes * 2 Bay Leaves * 1 Spring Thyme * 100g Parmesan Cheese ### Method: #160; Slice up all your veg in to nice small pieces. Cube up your chorizo. Gently the soften the garlic, onion, celery, chorizo and carrot in a heavy bottomed pan. Once softened, add the beef and the skinned sausage meat and continue frying until well browned. At this point, pour in the red wine and let evaporate. Add the tinned tomatoes, the bay leaves and thyme. Add the rind of the Parmesan, give it a stir, cover with a lid and leave to simmer on a low heat for 50 minutes.

Garnish with a sprinkling of parmesan and the remaining basil and tuck into this delicious frittata. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-courgette-frittata**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-courgette-frittata) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best sausage rolls you will ever eat. ## Preparation Time (Includes Preparation Time): 55 Minutes ## Notes: Try and use 2 baking trays so the sausage rolls have enough room between each of them. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Rolls of Puff Pastry * 1 Onion * 2 Tsp of Fennel Seeds * 1 Tsp of Rosemary * 2 Tsp  #8216;Nduja Paste * 6 Sausages * 3 Egg Yolks * 1 Orange * 150g of Manchego * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Add a drizzle of olive oil to a frying pan. Dice your onions and add 1 tsp of fennel seeds and chop up your rosemary and add the pan. Cook until the onions are translucent. 3. Place your cooked onions into a bowl and add your  #8216;nduja paste and squeeze out the meat from your sausage in. Next, grate the zest of your orange, 100g of Manchego, a sprinkle of salt and pepper and mix together thoroughly with your hands. 4. Next, take your pastry out and cut it in half (longways). Create a long sausage in the middle of your pastry, leaving about 2cm around the edge. Sprinkle half of your remaining manchego over the top of the sausage. Whisk your yolks in a separate cup, take a brush and cover the edge of the pastry in the whisked yolks. Fold your pastry over the sausage and seal the edges using a fork. Brush the top of the pastry with your egg yolk wash, sprinkle some salt and some fennel seeds on the top. Repeat with the other half of your pastry. Cut the sausage rolls into 16 evenly sized smaller sausage rolls. Bake for 45 minutes. 5. Once cooked, take them out of the oven and share with your MOB. **Full Recipe:** [**http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/nduja-sausage-rolls**](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/nduja-sausage-rolls) **Facebook:** [**https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/**](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [**https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/**](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Add some class to your mac and cheese. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Notes: If the sauce is not blending well, try adding more olive oil or a splash more water. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 4 Red Peppers * 60g of Sliced Almonds * 200g of Grated Mozzarella * 200g of Grated Cheddar * 400g of Macaroni * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 2 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar * 2 Tsp Smoked Paprika * Bunch of Parsley * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. Then, chop your peppers up into small pieces and place them in a baking tray. Coat the peppers with a glug of olive oil, salt and pepper, then bake in the oven for 35 minutes. 2. Whilst your peppers are baking, toast 50g of your almonds in a frying pan until slightly browned. 3. Get your macaroni on, see the packet for instructions. 4. Romesco time! Take your peppers out of the oven and put them in a blender along with your toasted almonds, peeled cloves of garlic, a glug of olive oil and the red wine vinegar. Then, sprinkle in your smoked paprika, salt, pepper, parsley and a splash of water. Blend it all together until you have a smooth, sauce-like consistency. 5. Add the romesco sauce to a hot frying pan and add half of your grated mozzarella and cheddar. Cook on a medium heat until these have melted, stirring continuously. Once your macaroni is cooked, add it to your sauce, stirring it through so that it is covered. Sprinkle your remaining cheddar, mozzarella and almonds on top. 6. Place the pan under a hot grill for 8 minutes, or until the cheese is golden-brown on top. 7. Get that baby plated up and dig in!

    <TEXT>Spice up your life with this creamy Harissa dish. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Removing the soggy seedy centre of your cucumber will stop your couscous getting soggy! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs * 500g Natural Yoghurt (One Pot) * 95g Harissa Paste (One Pot) * 400g Couscous * Bunch of Mint * Bunch of Coriander * Half a Cucumber * Half a Lime * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Roughly cut your chicken thighs into chunky strips and whack them in a bowl with four generous dollops of four tbsp yoghurt and three tsp of Harissa paste. Season this with salt and pepper and then massage the mixture into the chicken. 2. To cook your couscous, pour it into a large bowl and cover it in boiling water and leave this to absorb fully. Once absorbed, run a fork through the grains, separating them and fluffing it up. Cover this with a chopping board or a tea towel for five minutes. 3. Heat a healthy glug of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and then pop the chicken in, stirring occasionally and leaving to cook for around 20 minutes. 4. Chop your mint and coriander, and finely slice your cucumber. Add the herbs and cucumber to the couscous bowl, and squeeze a generous amount of lime juice over the top. Toss this thoroughly, season with salt and pepper, and then toss further. 5. Plate up a portion of couscous, top with your finished chicken, and dollop on some yoghurt and Harissa. To garnish, sprinkle a few more of your chopped herbs over it, and you #8217;re done! This dish is an instant crowdpleaser, so gather your mates together and enjoy!

    <TEXT>The most deliciously creamy salad you #8217;ll ever get your hands on ## Notes: To avoid the dreaded Avocado Hand, use the very tip of your knife and little pressure to slice into the avocado while still in it #8217;s peel. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 4 Skinless Chicken Breasts * 1 Garlic Head * 1 Lemon * 150g Grated Parmesan * 2 Tbsp Greek Yoghurt * 2 Baby Gem Lettuces * 200g Radishes (1 Pack) * 1 Avocado * 1 Bunch of Basil * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #186;C. Whack your chicken fillets into a baking tray, drizzle oil over them, and season them with salt and pepper. Massage them slightly and flip them over so they #8217;re evenly seasoned. Pop your full head of garlic in the centre of the baking tray, between the fillets and then roast this for 30 minutes. 2. Meanwhile in a medium bowl, combine your Greek yoghurt, 4 tablespoons of olive oil, the juice of a lemon, your parmesan, and salt and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of water and mix everything together. This will make a thick creamy dressing. 3. Once cooked through, remove your chicken from the oven and remove the garlic from the baking tray. Take this garlic and crush the whole head with the flat of a large knife. This will naturally allow the skin to peel off, but make sure it #8217;s all removed from the fleshy interior before chopping this up finely until it forms a chunky paste. Stir this into your cheesy dressing. 4. Using two forks, shred your chicken in it #8217;s tray and allow it to sit whilst you prep your veg. Separate the leaves from your baby gem lettuces and slice your radishes, then carefully dice your avocado. These can all go into a large salad bowl, along with your shredded chicken and basil leaves. Top this off with your cheesy dressing and mix it all together. Tuck in MOB, this one #8217;s a winner!

    <TEXT>Yes that's fine, but the automod didn't come through very quickly, and when I post a recipe I get a lot of comment notifications, so obviously missed yours. Sorry for the mix up, but we do consistently follow the subreddit rules and are regular contributors. I will be more vigilant going forward, but could you possibly re-instate the post? Thanks, Olly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ULTIMATE Bangers and Mash. Discussion over. ## Notes: Heat the sausages low and slow when you fry them so that they can cook evenly. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 600g of Potatoes * 12 Sausages * 2 Tbsp of Salted Butter * 300ml of Whole Milk * 800g of Petit Pois * 1 Lemon * 1 Pot of English Mustard * 2 Red Onions * 1 Beef Stock Cube * 1.5 Tbsp of Plain Flour * 1 Tbsp of Red Wine Vinegar * 1 Bunch of Parsely ## Method: 1. Firstly, chop up your potatoes (leaving the skins on) and add them to a pan of boiling water. Sprinkle in some salt and leave the potatoes to boil until soft. 2. Whilst the potatoes boil, it #8217;s sausage time. Pour a large glug of olive oil into a frying pan, then add in your sausages. Fry these on a low heat until they have browned all over. 3. Gravy time. Slice your red onions and add them to a frying pan along with a glug of olive oil. Once the onions are soft, crush in the stock cube and  #8230;g of flour and mix them into the onions. Then, pour in  #8230; of vinegar along with  #8230;ml of boiling water. Add in a sprinkling of parsley and heat it on a high heat, stirring continuously until it has a smooth sauce-like consistency. 4. Time to boil your peas. Cover your peas in boiling water and bring to the boil for around 3 minutes. Once boiled, drain them and add to the pan the juice of 1 lemon,  #8230; of olive oil and a sprinkling of pepper. Then, mash the peas roughly, leaving a bit of crunch. 5. Once your potatoes have boiled and are soft, drain the water from the pan and put them back into it. Add in your butter, milk and a teaspoon of mustard, along with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Mash this all together until it is nice and smooth. 6. Get the mash, peas and sausages onto a plate, with a big dollop of gravy on top and get stuck in!

    <TEXT>Hey sure, thanks for the question. So in the UK I would reccomend a British sausage such as a Cumberland, but having been to the US, I know you have very different sausage types. The spicy Italian ones you get out there are delicious, and could be really tasty in this dish, but wont necessarily match with the English mustard and red onions very well If you can get some Bratwurst, I think that is probably closest to a British sausage (Cumberland or Linkonshire pork) as you could get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The zingiest dish with the crispiest shallots in the land. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you slice your shallots nice and thin! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Cloves of Garlic * Large Knob of Ginger * 5 Spring Onions * 2 Courgettes * 1 Carrot * 2 Peppers (Red and Yellow) * 1 Red Chilli * 400g of Rice * 3 Tbsp of Reduced Salt Soy Sauce * 2 Tbsp of White Wine Vinegar * 300g of Shallots * 4 Eggs * Salt * Vegetable Oil * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Get your rice on (see pack instructions). 2. Start by dicing all of your vegetables. Heat a frying pan with a glug of olive oil and add your chopped carrots, peppers and courgettes and stir. As they begin to cook, add your spring onions, chilli, garlic and ginger and stir. Once your rice is cooked, add this in and mix. Next, add your soy sauce and vinegar and fold everything together. 3. Time to get on with those shallots. Pour around 200ml of vegetable oil into a small frying pan (so that it fills the pan). Slice up your shallots and add to the pan when the vegetable oil is nice and hot. Once the shallots are nice and crispy, set aside. 4. Egg Time. Crack your eggs into a bowl along with a pinch of salt and whisk. Next, make a well in your frying pan and pour the whisked egg into the middle. Start mixing the egg with your spoon. As it cooks, fold it into the rice. And that #8217;s it! Serve it up with a sprinkling of those crispy shallots and tuck into this bad boy.

    <TEXT>The zingiest dish with the crispiest shallots in the land. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you slice your shallots nice and thin! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Cloves of Garlic * Large Knob of Ginger * 5 Spring Onions * 2 Courgettes * 1 Carrot * 2 Peppers (Red and Yellow) * 1 Red Chilli * 400g of Rice * 3 Tbsp of Reduced Salt Soy Sauce * 2 Tbsp of White Wine Vinegar * 300g of Shallots * 4 Eggs * Salt * Vegetable Oil * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Get your rice on (see pack instructions). 2. Start by dicing all of your vegetables. Heat a frying pan with a glug of olive oil and add your chopped carrots, peppers and courgettes and stir. As they begin to cook, add your spring onions, chilli, garlic and ginger and stir. Once your rice is cooked, add this in and mix. Next, add your soy sauce and vinegar and fold everything together. 3. Time to get on with those shallots. Pour around 200ml of vegetable oil into a small frying pan (so that it fills the pan). Slice up your shallots and add to the pan when the vegetable oil is nice and hot. Once the shallots are nice and crispy, set aside. 4. Egg Time. Crack your eggs into a bowl along with a pinch of salt and whisk. Next, make a well in your frying pan and pour the whisked egg into the middle. Start mixing the egg with your spoon. As it cooks, fold it into the rice. And that #8217;s it! Serve it up with a sprinkling of those crispy shallots and tuck into this bad boy.

    <TEXT>One of the most delicious dishes ever. You will love this one MOB. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you don #8217;t throw your parmesan rind, it really makes the dish. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 150g Tomato Puree * 500g Rigatoni * 150g Parmesan (with rind) * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 1 Onion * 50ml Vodka * 2 Fresh Red Chillies * 200ml Double Cream * Bunch of Basil * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Finely slice your onion and red chillies. Grate your garlic. Chop off the ring from your block of parmesan. 2. Add a splash of olive oil to a pan. Add your onions. Cook until translucent, and then add your garlic and chilli. Fry for a minute, and then add your puree. Mix it in, and then cook for 4 minutes on a medium heat, allowing the tomato mix to catch on the pan. 3. At this point, add your vodka, deglazing the sticky bits off the bottom of the pan with your wooden spoon. Once the alcohol has burned off (20 seconds) add your cream. Add the rind of your parmesan. Mix it in and turn down the heat. 4. Get your pasta on, salting the pasta water generously. After 2 minutes, remove 200ml of pasta water from the pan. 5. Add 100ml to your vodka sauce. Stir it in. Then add 120g grated parmesan, salt and pepper. Mix it together and bubble on a low-medium heat until the cheese has melted. 6. When the pasta is al-dente, remove from the heat and drain. Add pasta to the vodka sauce. Start tossing it through, add splashes of pasta water to keep the sauce loose. 7. Serve the pasta into bowls. Top with torn basil and some more parmesan. Enjoy.

    <TEXT>A Wagamama favourite. Crispy squid brought to life with a zinger of a sauce. ## Cooking Time (Including Preparation Time): 20 Minutes ## Notes: The hotter the oil, the crispier the squid! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: **Spicy Vinegar** * 32g of Sugar * 2 Tbsp of Water * 5 Tbsp of Malt Vinegar * 5 Tbsp of Light Soy Sauce *  #189; a Red Chilli, Deseeded and Finely Chopped * 3 Coriander Sprigs, Stalks Removed and Leaves Finely Chopped **Crispy Squid** * 2 Squid, Body Only, About 400g * 100g Cornstarch * 280ml of Vegetable Oil * 2 Tsp of Shichimi * A Generous Pinch of Salt, Plus Extra to Taste * 2 Tbsp Spicy Vinegar ## Method **Spicy Vinegar** 1. Pour the sugar and water in a small saucepan over a medium-low heat and stir until dissolved. 2. Remove from the heat and add the soy sauce and vinegar. 3. Stir in the chilli and coriander just before use. **Chilli Squid** 1. First, prepare the squid. Rinse them under cold water and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Ensure the squid are thoroughly dry before frying for good, crispy results. 2. Transfer the squid to a chopping board and slice them open down the middle so you are left with a rectangular shape. Remove any thin or excess skin to ensure the surface is smooth and soft. 3. Using a sharp knife, lightly score the inside of the squid in a small grid or diamond pattern, then slice into 1 inch-wide pieces. 4. Place the cornstarch in a shallow bowl and dip the squid pieces in the cornstarch, making sure they are all thoroughly coated. 5. Heat the oil in a deep skillet or wok. Once the oil is hot, add the squid pieces, and fry for approximately 2 minutes until pale golden. Do not fry for too long as they will become tough and chewy, work in batches if necessary. 6. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil. 7. Add the fried squid into a bowl and sprinkle the shichimi and salt over the top. Give the squid a good toss to coat. 8. Serve immediately with the spicy vinegar on the side for dipping.

    <TEXT> #160;A flavour combination like no other. #160; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 25 Minutes ## Notes: Keep an eye on the Teriyaki sauce while it simmers as any burning will ruin the sticky sweet taste. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 70ml of Reduced Salt Soy Sauce * 70ml of Brown Sugar Packed * 1/8 Tsp of Fresh Minced Ginger * 1 Clove of Garlic Minced * 2 Tbsp of Honey * 140ml of Water * 4 Salmon Fillets * 8 Tbsp of Mayonnaise * 2 Tbsp of Sriracha * 2 Tbsp of Cornstarch * 3 Tbsp of Water * Sesame Seeds * Chopped Spring Onion ## Method: 1. Make the Sriracha Mayo by combining the mayo and sriracha in a small bowl. Stir until combined. Set aside. 2. Set the Crock-Pot Express Multi-Cooker to the Saut #233; function with the High heat setting. Add the soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, honey and water to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the Saut #233; heat setting to Low and allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the Crock-Pot Express Multi-Cooker. #160; 3. Set the Crock-Pot Express Multi Cooker to the Rice function and add 400g rice and twice as much water. Cook until all water is absorbed, and rice is fluffy, which should take 10-12 minutes. Run a fork through the rice to separate the grains and place to the side in a bowl. This can be reheated when the salmon is ready. 4. Place salmon fillets into the Crock-Pot Express Multi-Cooker with the sauce, skin/flat side up. Place the lid on and set the vent to sealing. Select the Pressure Cook function and set the time to 1 minute. Allow to pressure cook, then allow for a 5-minute pressure release. Release the remaining pressure from the Crock Pot Express Multi Cooker and remove the lid. Check the salmon. It should be cooked through at this point, but if not, allow to cook in the warm sauce for a minute or so to complete cooking. 5. Set the Crock-Pot Express Multi-Cooker to Saut #233;. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water and stir until completely smooth. Add to the sauce a bit at a time and cook, stirring, until mixture thickens to desired level. Place salmon in your bowl of rice, then pour the sauce over salmon and garnish with sesame seeds, chopped green onion and a drizzle of the Sriracha Mayo. #160; #160; **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/teryiaki-salmon](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/teryiaki-salmon)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Creamy, crispy, smokey. MOB #8217;s mac is back. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: #160; Look out for any lumps and bumps of flour while whisking. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 275g Smoked Streaky Bacon * 3 Spring Onions * Bunch of Thyme * 4 Tbsps of Flour * 600ml of Whole Milk * 200g Grated Cheddar * 200g Grated Parmesan * 1 Ball of Mozzarella * 400g of Macaroni * 50g of Breadcrumbs * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Chop your bacon up into small pieces and place them in a frying pan. Cook until crispy and golden. Chop up your spring onions and tear off a handful of fresh thyme, saving some for later, and add this to the pan. Stir through for a few minutes and then transfer to a bowl to use later. 3. Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to the frying pan with your flour. Whisk until the olive oil and flour have combined and then add a splash of milk. Whisk, and then keep adding milk and whisking until you have a creamy consistency. 4. Get your macaroni on, see the packet for instructions. 5. While the pasta cooks, it #8217;s time for cheese! Go back to your frying pan of creamy goodness and sprinkle in cheddar and parmesan and tear in the mozzarella. Give the sauce a good mix until all the cheese has melted. 6. Add the macaroni to the cheesy sauce, give it a stir and then whack in the bacon mixture. Season with a good pinch of salt, black pepper and stir. 7. Sprinkle the mac with your breadcrumbs, grate some more parmesan over the top, tear in the saved thyme and crack pepper over to finish. 8. Place the pan under a hot grill for 8 minutes, or until the breadcrumbs are crispy and golden-brown on top. 9.

    <TEXT>Your fave Katsu, with a spicy twist. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Notes: Go heavier on the hot sauce if you like the spice. ## Ingredients: * 3 Eggs * 8 Skinless, Boneless Chicken Thighs * 2 Tbsp of Sweet Chilli Sauce * 2 Tbsp of Soy Sauce * 8 Tbsp of Flour #160; * 600ml of Chicken Stock * 400g of Basmati Rice #160; * 4 Tsp Curry Powder * 2 Tsp of Chilli Powder * Knob of Ginger * 4 Cloves of Garlic * 2 Onions #160; * 3 Carrots * 200g of Panko Breadcrumbs * Vegetable Oil ## Method: 1. Rinse your rice and boil it in 2 times the amount of water. 2. Katsu sauce time. Chop up your onions, carrots, garlic and your knob of ginger. You want to cut the onions and carrots into nice little cubes. #160; 3. Add a good glug vegetable oil to a large pan. Fry the onions and carrots until soft and caramelised. At this point, add the garlic and the ginger. Fry for a further 3 minutes. Add the curry powder and chilli powder. Mix and then add 2 tbsp of the flour (gradually, so you don #8217;t get any lumps). Mix that in and pour in your chicken stock. 4. Next, add the soy sauce. Mix and allow to bubble down and thicken. You want to bubble the sauce for 5-10 minutes so the flavour from the onions and carrots infuses. If it gets too thick, just add a splash more water. Once the sauce is the perfect pouring consistency, remove it from the heat and pass it through a sieve. Set the sieved veg aside. #160; 5. Place the remaining thick katsu sauce on the heat. Add your sweet chilli sauce, and mix everything together. Cover the sauce and set aside. 6. Chicken time. Take your chicken thighs. Dip them in the rest of your flour, coat them in your whisked egg and then roll them in the breadcrumbs. Heat a generous amount of oil in a frying pan and add the chicken thighs. You want to have the oil on a low to medium heat. Add your thighs. The trick here is to cook for 4-5 minutes each side. Remove from the heat once the chicken is cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden brown. 7. Slice up the chicken and serve on a bed of rice with the katsu sauce poured over the top. Add a spoonful of your katsu veg on the side and tuck in! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe**: [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/spicy-chicken-katsu](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/spicy-chicken-katsu)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crispy r #246;sti #8217;s and bacon. What more could you want? ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Squeeze as much liquid out of the grated potatoes as possible. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Pack of Co-op #8217;s Dry Cured Unsmoked Back Bacon Rashers * 4 Spring Onions * 3 Large Maris Piper Potatoes * 4 Tbsp of Greek Yoghurt * 4 Tsp of Harissa Paste * Bunch of Parsley * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Slice your bacon into small pieces. Drizzle olive oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add your bacon and saut #233; until golden brown and crispy. Slice 3 of your spring onions, leaving one for later, and add them to the pan. Stir until they have softened and add the contents of the pan to a separate bowl, keeping the oil in the pan for later. 2. Next, grate your potatoes. Once grated, squeeze out excess juices so they are nice and dry for frying. Then, add them to your bacon along with a grinding of pepper and mix together. Next, take a handful of the grated potato and form a potato patty. Repeat this until you have run out of the potato mixture. 3. Next, re-heat the oil you saved earlier. Once hot, add your r #246;sti #8217;s to the pan and fry until golden brown on either side. 4. Time to plate up! Add 2 r #246;sti #8217;s to your plate along with a dollop of sour cream and a tsp of harissa paste. Chop up your remaining spring onion and parsley and sprinkle over the top. Repeat for your MOB and tuck in. **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/bacon-rosti](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/bacon-rosti)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crispy r #246;sti #8217;s and bacon. What more could you want? ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Squeeze as much liquid out of the grated potatoes as possible. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Pack of Co-op #8217;s Dry Cured Unsmoked Back Bacon Rashers * 4 Spring Onions * 3 Large Maris Piper Potatoes * 4 Tbsp of Greek Yoghurt * 4 Tsp of Harissa Paste * Bunch of Parsley * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Slice your bacon into small pieces. Drizzle olive oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add your bacon and saut #233; until golden brown and crispy. Slice 3 of your spring onions, leaving one for later, and add them to the pan. Stir until they have softened and add the contents of the pan to a separate bowl, keeping the oil in the pan for later. 2. Next, grate your potatoes.

    <TEXT>A proper winter warmer. #160; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 35 Minutes ## Notes: Slightly charred edges on your butternut squash will add more flavour to the soup. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Butternut Squash * 2 Carrots * 1 Onion * 3 Tsp of Very Lazy Chopped Ginger * 600ml of Vegetable Stock * 2 Tsp of Very Lazy Chopped Garlic * Bunch of Parsley * 2 Small Loaves of Ciabatta * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Halve and peel your butternut squash, scoop out the seeds and cut it into cubes. Place the cubes on a baking tray and season with a few cracks of black pepper, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Toss the butternut squash to season on all sides and whack the tray in the oven for 50 minutes. 3. Finely dice your carrots and onion. Pour a large drizzle of olive oil into a frying pan on medium-high heat. Add your carrots and onion and saut #233; for 10 minutes, until the carrots have softened and the onions are translucent. Add the Very Lazy Chopped Ginger and give it all a stir. 4. Squash time! Add the roasted butternut squash to your pan and stir to combine (leave the oven on for your garlic bread). Pour in the vegetable stock and season with a few cracks of pepper. Leave to simmer for 15 minutes. Blitz the soup in the pan with a stick blender until silky smooth, or your desired consistency. 5. Now for the garlic bread. Slice your ciabatta in half down the middle and place on a baking tray. Finely chop a large handful of parsley, leaving a third for later. In a bowl, mix together 3 tbsp of olive oil, the Very Lazy Chopped Garlic, two thirds of the parsley, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Give it a mix and spread over the ciabatta. Pop in the oven for 20 minutes. 6. Serve the soup with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of parsley, a crack of black pepper and your garlic bread.

    <TEXT>A beautiful autumnal risotto. So creamy. So delicious. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: Make sure you add the stock bit by bit and not all at once. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Medium Pumpkin * 25g of Butter * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 6 Shallots * 350g of Risotto Rice * 1l of Vegetable Stock * 175g of Parmesan * Bunch of Parsley * Bunch of Rosemary * 4 Tsp of Balsamic Glaze * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Cut your pumpkin into medium-sized chunks and scoop out the seeds, removing any strands that may be attached. Scatter the seeds onto a baking tray and season with a pinch of salt and a few sprigs of rosemary. Give the tray a good shake to coat the seeds in seasoning and whack in the oven for 15 minutes or until golden and crispy. Set aside for later. #160; 3. Grate the soft inside of the pumpkin until you reach the outside skin. Finely dice your shallots and garlic. Melt the butter and a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan on medium heat. Add your garlic and fry until lightly coloured. Add the shallots and saut #233; for a minute before adding the grated pumpkin. Cook for 10 minutes or until the pumpkin has softened, stirring often. 4. Add the rice and stir to coat it in the pumpkin mixture. Add 250ml of hot stock one at a time, stirring continuously, until it is all used up and the rice is creamy. This should take about 20 minutes, but add more stock and cook for longer if necessary. 5. Season the risotto with a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Grate your parmesan, leaving a handful for later and sprinkle it over the rice. Chop your bunch of parsley, saving a large pinch for garnish, and add it to the pan. Give the risotto a big stir and leave it to rest for a minute. 6. Garnish the pumpkin risotto with one tsp of balsamic glaze per portion, the remaining parmesan, and parsley. Sprinkle the toasted pumpkin seeds on top and add a final pinch of salt and pepper.

    <TEXT>The most delicious traybake you will ever munch. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: Make sure you really rub the garlic and parsley into the ciabatta for extra flavour. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 150g of Mozzarella #160; * 400g of Cherry Vine Tomatoes *  #189; Tsp of Chilli Flakes *  #189; Tbsp of Fennel Seeds * 1 Tbsp of Oregano * 1 Aubergine #160; * 1 Courgette * 1 Red Onion * 3 Peppers (Red, Orange, Yellow) * 1 Loaf of Ciabatta #160; * Bunch of Parsley * 30g of Pine Nuts * 4 Cloves of Garlic * 70g of Parmesan * Bunch of Basil * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Pesto time. Add a large handful of fresh basil to a food processor with 8 tbsp of olive oil. Finely grate your parmesan and add it to the food processor with 2 cloves of peeled garlic, 15g of pine nuts and a pinch of salt. Blend until you achieve a creamy pesto consistency, season to taste and set aside for later. #160; 3. Slice your peppers, onion and courgette. Slice your aubergine and cut each slice into quarters. Add the veg to a large bowl and sprinkle with oregano, fennel seeds, chilli flakes and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Mix through until the vegetables are coated in seasoning. 4. Spread your veg out onto two baking trays. Keep the cherry tomatoes on the vine and add to both trays. Whack in the oven for 25 minutes. 5. Crouton time. Chop your ciabatta into bite-sized chunks and add to a large bowl. Add a good drizzle of olive oil over the bread. Crush your garlic and chop a handful of parsley and add it to the bowl. Give it a good mix so that the garlic and parsley fully coat each piece of ciabatta. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper. 6. Remove your trays from the oven and spread your garlic croutons onto each tray. Tear and add your mozzarella in the same way. Spoon your pesto evenly over each tray and bake for 10 minutes until the mozzarella is melted. Sprinkle the remaining pine nuts over both trays and bake for 5 minutes. 7. Add a final drizzle of olive oil to each traybake and dig in! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/pesto-veggie-traybake](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/pesto-veggie-traybake)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The freshest and most delicious pasta around. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 15 Minutes ## Notes: #160; Make sure to salt your aubergine really well to draw out as much moisture as possible to reduce bitterness. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Aubergines * 6 Cloves of Garlic * 2 Tins of Peeled Plum Tomatoes in Juice * Bunch of Basil * 400g of Fusilli * 250g of Ricotta * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat the oven to 220 #176;C. 2. Dice your aubergine into cubes, roughly 2cm wide. Add the aubergine to a large bowl and sprinkle 3-4 big pinches of salt over the top. Mix the salt through the aubergine and leave for 20 minutes. 3. Once 20 minutes is up, add the aubergine to a colander and rinse to remove the salt. Drain the aubergine and add it back into the bowl, patting dry with kitchen roll to remove any excess water. Scatter the aubergine onto two trays, ensuring the pieces are well spread out. Drizzle a generous amount of olive oil on top and mix it into the aubergine. Whack in the oven for 20 minutes, turning occasionally. Roast until soft and caramelised. 4. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Add a big glug of olive oil to a pan on medium heat. Finely slice your garlic, add it to the pan and saut #233; for 2-3 minutes. Drain and roughly chop your tomatoes before adding to the pan. Mix to combine the tomatoes and garlic and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. 5. Finely chop a handful of basil, saving a handful for later. Add one handful to the pan and stir through the sauce. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes. 6. Get your pasta on. Salt the water and cook according to pack instructions. 7. Add the aubergine to the sauce with a glug of olive oil and stir through. Add the pasta to the sauce and give it a big mix. Season to taste. 8. Serve the pasta with 2-3 tsp of ricotta, a drizzle of olive oil, a good grind of pepper and a sprinkle of basil.

    <TEXT>Would it really be Christmas without camembert? ## Cooking time (Including Preparation Time): 35 minutes ## Notes: You may want to encase your camembert in tin foil if it starts to melt out of its box. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 500g of Red Grapes * 1  #189; Tsp of Chilli Flakes * 1 Camembert (250g) - Make sure to buy it in its wooden box * 1 Large Ciabatta * 100g of Butter * 4 Garlic Cloves * 2 Tbsp of Balsamic Vinegar * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Line a roasting tray with baking paper. Cut the grapes into small bunches. Put the grapes onto the tray and drizzle with olive oil. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper. Sprinkle 1 tsp of chilli flakes over the grapes and whack the tray in the oven for 10 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, take the camembert out of the plastic wrapping and its cloth then place it back in the empty box with the lid off. Prick the top of the cheese all over with a sharp knife. Season with a grind of pepper and  #189; a tsp of chilli flakes. Once the grapes have cooked for their allotted time, nestle the cheese in the centre of the tray and roast for another 10 minutes. 4. Ciabatta time. Cut the ciabatta in half lengthways and then in half across the middle. Slice the bread into soldiers around an inch thick and set aside. 5. Melt the butter in a saucepan or microwave and add to a bowl. Crush the garlic, add to the butter and stir. Set aside. 6. Lay your ciabatta soldiers in a single layer on a large baking tray.

    <TEXT>The ultimate buffalo wings have arrived. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you by the hot sauce in the ingredients - perfect for wings. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 kg Chicken Wings * 1 Tbsp of Baking Powder * 300g of Extra Mature Cheddar Cheese * Bunch of Chives * 75g of Butter * 1/2 Tsp of Cayenne Pepper * 148ml Bottle Frank #8217;s Original Pepper Hot Sauce * 2 Tsp of Worcestershire Sauce * 300ml of Sour Cream * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Put the chicken wings in a bowl, add the baking powder and season well with salt and pepper. Toss the wings so that each is coated in the baking powder. Baking powder is the secret to getting super crisp wings without deep frying them. #160; 3. Lay the chicken wings out in a single layer on top of a wire rack lined roasting tray - a grill tray would be perfect for this. More circulation = more crispiness. Roast in the oven for 40-45 minutes until cooked through, golden and crisp, turning halfway. 4. Whilst the chicken wings are roasting make the sauces. Finely grate the cheddar into a bowl. Chop up your chives and add them to the bowl saving a handful for later. Add your sour cream and mix together. Sprinkle the remaining chives over the top. 5. For the buffalo sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Once melted, take it off the heat and add to a bowl. Add the bottle of hot sauce along with the cayenne pepper and the Worcestershire sauce. Whisk until it comes together and set aside. #160; 6. Get the wings out of the oven, tip them into a bowl, pour over the buffalo sauce. Toss so that each wing is completely coated. Serve the wings with the cheese and chive sauce. #160; **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/buffalo-wings](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/buffalo-wings)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A saucy little number #8230; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 hour 15 mins ## Notes: If you want it to be crispy, whack it under the grill for a few minutes at the end. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1kg Potatoes * 2 Onions * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 160g Diced Pancetta * 187ml Bottle of White Wine * 400g of Brie or 2 Blocks (If you can access/find Reblochon, then use instead of Brie, but it works as a good substitute) * 300ml Double Cream * Green Salad * 100g Cornichons * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Place your potatoes into a large saucepan of cold salted water over a high heat. Bring to the boil. Once boiling cook the potatoes for 12-15 minutes until just tender - when a cutlery knife slides nearly into the centre, they are ready. Drain into a colander and leave to cool slightly. #160; 3. Meanwhile, slice the onions and finely chop the garlic cloves. Get a frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in a drizzle of olive oil, add the onion and pancetta. Fry, stirring regularly until the onions are collapsed and golden and the pancetta is crisp. Stir in the garlic, cook for 1 minute more then pour in the white wine. Once the wine has bubbled away by half take the pan off the heat. #160; 4. Back to the potatoes. Chop into smallish chunks and season well with salt and black pepper. Set aside. Leaving the rind on both, cut one brie into cubes and slice the other. 5. Layer the potatoes along with the pancetta onions and cubed brie into a baking dish. Pour over the double cream then top with the brie slices. #160; 6. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbling. Leave the potatoes to cool for 5 minutes before tucking in. Serve with a green salad and the cornichons. **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-tartiflette](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-tartiflette)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A real showstopper of a dish. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 55 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you don #8217;t cut all the way through the squash. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Large Butternut Squash * 1 Red Chilli * 70g Flaked Almonds * 50g Feta * Bunch of Parsley * Bunch of Mint * 1 Tsp Dried Oregano * 3 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar * 2 Tbsp Capers * 1 Red Onion * Olive Oil * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 215 #176;C. 2. Start by peeling your squashes. Cut them in half and de-seed. Place them on a baking tray, flat side down. Add a generous drizzle of olive oil over the top and season with a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Place into the oven for 15 minutes. 3. Once 15 minutes is up, take them out of the oven. It #8217;s hasselback time. Take one butternut half and cut across the squash with about 0.5cm intervals, making sure that you stop before you hit the bottom of the squash. Repeat this for the remaining squashes (yep, it is spelt squashes). Place back in the oven for 20 minutes. Once 20 minutes is up take them out and baste the squashes with the juices in the tray. Whack back in the oven for a further 20 minutes. 4. Onto the chimichurri. Start by chopping your mint, parsley, chilli, red onion. Add everything into a small bowl as well is your red wine vinegar, 3 tbsp of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Mix together. 5. Toast your almonds until golden. 6. Once your squashes are done, take them out of the oven and serve with a quarter of the chimichurri sauce, a small handful of almonds and crumble a quarter of feta over the top. Repeat for your MOB and tuck in. **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/hasselback-butternut-squash](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/hasselback-butternut-squash)</TEXT>

Whack back in the oven for a further 20 minutes. 4. Onto the chimichurri. Start by chopping your mint, parsley, chilli, red onion. Add everything into a small bowl as well is your red wine vinegar, 3 tbsp of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Mix together. 5. Toast your almonds until golden. 6. Once your squashes are done, take them out of the oven and serve with a quarter of the chimichurri sauce, a small handful of almonds and crumble a quarter of feta over the top.

    <TEXT>The naughtiest vegan Shakshuka there is. #8288; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: Make sure you have enough tahini dollops distributed on top of your shakshuka. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Onion * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 1 Tsp Ground Coriander * 6 Tsp Harissa Paste * 1 Jar Roasted Red Peppers (400g) * 2 Cans Tinned Tomatoes * 3 Tbsp Tahini * 1 Lemon * 1 Large Bunch of Parsley * 1 Loaf of Ciabatta * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Start by finely chopping your onions and 1 clove of garlic. Add a drizzle of oil to a frying pan followed by your onions and stir. Once they begin to become translucent, add 1 clove of garlic. Next, add ground coriander and three tsp of harissa paste to your pan. Mix together. Chop up and add your roasted peppers and tinned tomatoes. Fill up your empty tins with water and add to the mix. Break down the tomatoes with your spoon and leave to simmer on a low heat for 15 minutes. 3. Tahini time. Add 3 tsp of tahini to a bowl along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Squeeze in the juice of a whole lemon and then grate the zest in too. Add a glug of olive oil and a splash of water to the bowl. Mix together until it begins to thicken. Set aside. 4. Chop up your half of parsley and grate your remaining garlic cloves. Add to a new bowl and pour in around 5 tbsp of olive oil along with a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Mix together until fully combined. Cut your ciabatta in half and dress it evenly with the garlic mixture. Whack your ciabatta in the oven for 15 minutes. 5. Whilst your ciabatta is toasting, chop up your remaining parsley (saving a handful for garnish) and add it into your simmering shakshuka sauce, followed by a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Take your ciabatta out of the oven once the edges are slightly charred. 6. Spoon out holes in your shakshuka and dollop in your tahini sauce.

    <TEXT>The naughtiest vegan Shakshuka there is. #8288; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: Make sure you have enough tahini dollops distributed on top of your shakshuka. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Onion * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 1 Tsp Ground Coriander * 6 Tsp Harissa Paste * 1 Jar Roasted Red Peppers (400g) * 2 Cans Tinned Tomatoes * 3 Tbsp Tahini * 1 Lemon * 1 Large Bunch of Parsley * 1 Loaf of Ciabatta * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Start by finely chopping your onions and 1 clove of garlic. Add a drizzle of oil to a frying pan followed by your onions and stir. Once they begin to become translucent, add 1 clove of garlic. Next, add ground coriander and three tsp of harissa paste to your pan. Mix together. Chop up and add your roasted peppers and tinned tomatoes. Fill up your empty tins with water and add to the mix. Break down the tomatoes with your spoon and leave to simmer on a low heat for 15 minutes. 3. Tahini time. Add 3 tsp of tahini to a bowl along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Squeeze in the juice of a whole lemon and then grate the zest in too. Add a glug of olive oil and a splash of water to the bowl. Mix together until it begins to thicken. Set aside. 4. Chop up your half of parsley and grate your remaining garlic cloves. Add to a new bowl and pour in around 5 tbsp of olive oil along with a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Mix together until fully combined. Cut your ciabatta in half and dress it evenly with the garlic mixture. Whack your ciabatta in the oven for 15 minutes. 5. Whilst your ciabatta is toasting, chop up your remaining parsley (saving a handful for garnish) and add it into your simmering shakshuka sauce, followed by a pinch of salt and a grinding of pepper. Take your ciabatta out of the oven once the edges are slightly charred. 6. Spoon out holes in your shakshuka and dollop in your tahini sauce.

    <TEXT>A warming but fresh, cheeky dhal. #160; ## Cooking time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 Minutes #160; ## Notes: Make sure your chutney is nicely blitzed to a drizzling consistency. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 750g Carrots #160; * 1 Tbsp Cumin Seeds * 1 Tbsp Curry Powder #160; * 1 Onion #160; * 3 Cloves of Garlic #160; * Thumb Sized Piece of Ginger #160; * 1 Tbsp Turmeric #160; * 300g Split Red Lentils #160; * 1 Green Chilli #160; * 1 Bunch Coriander #160; * 3 Tbsp Desiccated Coconut #160; * 6 Tbsp Coconut Yoghurt * 1 Lime #160; * Salt * Pepper * Vegetable Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Peel the carrots and cut them into finger-length pieces. Transfer to a large roasting tray. Spoon over the cumin seeds and curry powder, season well with sea salt and black pepper. Drizzle over some oil. Use your hands to coat the carrots in the spices then spread out into a single layer. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes until completely tender and a little charred. 3. Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger. Get a saucepan over a medium heat. Pour a glug of oil. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes then add in the garlic and ginger. Cook for a minute more. #160; 4. Add the turmeric and stir then add your lentils and give everything a good mix. Next, pour 1.2 litres of hot water into the pan. Simmer the dahl away over a medium heat for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally until the lentils have absorbed the majority of the liquid, have completely broken down and are creamy. #160; 5. Whilst the dahl and carrots cook add your chilli and coriander to a blender (save a small amount of coriander for garnish). Blitz until finely chopped then, add the desiccated coconut, 4 tbsp of coconut yoghurt. Season with salt and black pepper. Blitz again to form a vivid green chutney to a drizzling consistency. #160; 6. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the dahl, then add 2 tbsp of coconut yoghurt, season with salt and pepper. Stir everything together, then divide between bowls. Top with the curried carrots, along with any roasting oils then spoon over the coriander coconut chutney. Scatter over the remaining coriander leaves. Next, tuck in and enjoy! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [**h**ttp://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/curried-carrot-dahl](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/curried-carrot-dahl)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A naughty little alternative to your traditional Pad Thai. #160; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you let your brussels char a bit to intensify the flavour. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 500g Brussel Sprouts * 225g Block of Smoked Tofoo * 1 Lime * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 2 Tbsp Tamarind Paste * 3 Tbsp Soy Sauce #160; * 2 Tbsp Soft Brown Sugar #160; * 400g Wide Flat Rice Noodles * 2 Tbsp Chilli Oil With Sediment (we used Lee Kum Kee) * 200g Beansprouts #160; * Handful Salted Roasted Peanuts #160; * Bunch of Coriander #160; * Vegetable Oil ## Method: 1. Trim the bases off the brussel sprouts and cut them in half. Cut the tofu into roughly 1cm squares. Cut the lime into four wedges. Finely chop the garlic cloves. #160; 2. For the sauce, mix together the tamarind, soy and soft brown sugar. Set aside. #160; 3. Soak the rice noodles in a large bowl full of hot water for 10 minutes. #160; 4. While the noodles are soaking, get a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Pour in some vegetable oil. Add the sprouts. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes until beginning to soften and lightly colour then scrape in the garlic. Cook for 1 minute more. #160; 5. Scrape the brussels and garlic to one side of the pan.

Cook for a further 2 minutes until the noodles are soft enough to eat then add the beansprouts, chilli oil, and most of the peanuts to the pan. #160; 7.

For the sauce, mix together the tamarind, soy and soft brown sugar. Set aside. #160; 3. Soak the rice noodles in a large bowl full of hot water for 10 minutes. #160; 4. While the noodles are soaking, get a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Pour in some vegetable oil. Add the sprouts. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes until beginning to soften and lightly colour then scrape in the garlic. Cook for 1 minute more. #160; 5. Scrape the brussels and garlic to one side of the pan. Pour in a splash more oil and add the tofu. Fry for 2-3 minutes until beginning to crisp then turn the heat to the lowest whilst you drain the noodles. 6. Get the pan back on the heat, tip in the drained noodles along with a splash of water. Give everything a good mix, fry for 2 minutes then pour in the sauce. Cook for a further 2 minutes until the noodles are soft enough to eat then add the beansprouts, chilli oil, and most of the peanuts to the pan. #160; 7. Give everything one last toss then dish the Pad Thai into bowls. Top with the remaining peanuts and some torn coriander. You #8217;re ready to plate up and tuck in! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/vegan-pad-thai](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/vegan-pad-thai)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ooziest Mac  amp; Cheese you #8217;ll ever munch. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 30 Minutes #160; ## Notes: Take your time making the white sauce, it will pay off! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 100g Butter * 3 Large Onions * 187ml Bottle White Wine * A Few Sprigs of Thyme * 450g Macaroni #160; * 4 Tbsp Plain Flour #160; * 800ml Whole Milk #160; * 200g Gruy #232;re * 200g Extra Mature Cheddar #160; * 1 Heaped Tsp Dijon Mustard #160; * 100g Breadcrumbs * Salt * Pepper **Method:** 1. Finely slice the onions. Get a frying pan over a medium heat. Melt a third of the butter in the pan. Add the onions with a good pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until completely collapsed, soft and caramelised. This will take around 30 minutes. #160; 2. Once the onions are cooked, pour in the white wine and add the thyme, stripping the leaves from the stalks straight into the pan. Leave to bubble away by half then take the pan off the heat. The onions can be done in advance and kept in the fridge. 3. Cook the macaroni in a large pan of boiling salted water for 2 minutes less than packet instructions. Drain once ready. #160; 4. Meanwhile make the cheese sauce. Melt the remaining butter in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Once melted add the flour, whisk to combine - this is your roux. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the cold milk into the flour mixture, adding a little at a time, in order to get a smooth sauce. Once all the milk has been added, bubble the sauce away for 5 minutes until thickened. #160; 5. Grate in all the cheddar and half the gruyere cheese. Once the cheese has melted take the sauce off the heat, add the dijon mustard and season with salt and pepper. 6. Add the cooked macaroni and caramelised onions into the cheese sauce, reserving a tablespoon of the onions. Mix well to combine, and then top with the remaining onions, a grating of gruy #232;re and your breadcrumbs. Add a handful more thyme leaves. 7. Place under the grill until bubbling and golden brown. Remove from the oven and tuck in. **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-french-onion-mac-and-cheese](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mobs-french-onion-mac-and-cheese)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The tastiest pasta you will ever make. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 2 Hours ## Notes: You may need to cover your chicken with a lid or tinfoil to ensure the roasting juices don #8217;t evaporate. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 1 Whole Chicken * Knob of Ginger * 1 Lemon * 50ml White Wine * 2 Cloves of Garlic * 500g Tomatoes * Small Bunch of Basil * 500g Orecchiette Pasta * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C. 2. Grate the ginger and juice the lemon (keep one half of the lemon). 3. Place the chicken onto a baking tray and put the grated ginger and one half of the lemon inside the chicken then season with salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Coat the outside of the chicken in olive oil and season well then place in the oven for 45 minutes. 4. Sauce time. To start, you need to peel the tomatoes but don #8217;t worry it #8217;s easy to do. Put some water on to boil, score the tomatoes and then place them in the boiling water for about 30 seconds. Take them out and put them into a bowl of ice-cold water and the skins will begin to peel off immediately.  #160;Once you have peeled the skins off the tomatoes, cut them into quarters and deseed them. 5. After 45 minutes, remove the chicken from the oven. The next step for the sauce is to add the lemon juice and wine into the baking tray into the roasting juices. Put the chicken back in the oven for a further 45 minutes. You will know the chicken is cooked when the juices run clear and the fibres in the meat are set. 6. Slice up the garlic and add to a frying pan with some olive oil  #8211; once the garlic and olive oil start to sizzle and become fragrant add the tomatoes in, a large pinch of salt and fry for about 5 minutes constantly shaking the pan. Tear up the basil, but save some for garnishing, and add to the cooking tomatoes then give it a good stir. 7. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the baking tray and place it on a chopping board. Pour the roasting juices from the tray in with the tomatoes and give it a good mix and allow it to cook together for a further 10 minutes. 8. Meanwhile, boil the pasta as instructed on the packet. Once it is cooked pour it in with the sauce and season well. 9. Serve up the pasta in a large bowl, place your carved chicken on top and garnish with some basil leaves, then tuck into the best chicken pasta ever. **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) Full Recipe: [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/issys-chicken-pasta](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/issys-chicken-pasta)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The creamiest and tastiest garlic pasta around Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour Notes: Make sure to put your all into beating the pasta to avoid any lumps! Feeds: 4 People Ingredients: 130g Parmesan 40g Pecorino 3 Bulbs of Garlic 450g Linguine 1 Lemon #160; 1.5 Tbsp Pepper Salt Method: Preheat oven to 180 #176;C. Place your garlic bulbs on a piece of baking paper and wrap them up. Place the garlic parcel in a roasting tin and whack in the oven for 40 minutes. Very finely grate your Parmesan and your pecorino and add to a mixing bowl. Grate in the zest of a lemon. Place a frying pan on the heat. Add 1.5 tbsp of pepper into the pan. Toast the pepper, mixing it around the pan, and remove from the heat as it starts properly smoking. Add to the cheese bowl. Once the garlic is done (it will be squidgy if you press it), remove from the oven. Peel back the skin and with a knife, squish out the roast garlic within. Once all the garlic is squeezed out, discard of the skins. Chop the garlic up until you have a nice smooth paste. Add to the cheese bowl. Get a fork and mix the cheese and garlic together. Once it is all combined, you should have a nice thick paste. Now you need to get everything ready, as speed and timing are key. Get a jug out, and boil your kettle. Put your pan on the heat, and add your water  #8211; don #8217;t fill it, you only need enough water to cover the pasta (you need the water to be very very starchy). Add a nice big pinch of salt to the water and bring to the boil. Then add your linguine. After 4 minutes, with your jug/mug remove 300ml starchy water from pan. Add it bit by bit to your cheese paste, making sure it is all nicely combined. You #8217;ll end up with a nice creamy consistency. Back to the pasta  #8211; after 8 minutes in total, drain the pasta and pour about 200ml pasta water into another cup. You #8217;ll need this. Add the pasta back to the pan and put the pan back on a very very very low heat. Quickly,  #160;pour over your sauce. Start beating the sauce through the pasta. As it begins to thicken, keep adding splashes of your pasta water. Keep beating and adding splashes. If it gets stringy or lumps of cheese appear, don #8217;t worry. Just keep beating hard and adding water. This will take about 3 minutes  #8211; what you are going for is a thick creamy emulsion. Turn off the heat and keep beating for 1 final minute. Once the consistency of your pasta resembles the photo, you #8217;re ready to go. Serve the pasta on to 4 plates. Top with an extra grinding of pepper, a sprinkle cheese and a nice squeeze of lemon juice (it really cuts through the rich cheese and garlic). Enjoy MOB x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The perfect dish for your MOB. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 3 Hours 30 Minutes ## Notes: #160; Stay patient with the milk, its worth it! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Onions * 2 Large Carrots * 2 Sticks of Celery * 750g Beef Mince * 1 Tsp Nutmeg * 2 Bay Leaves * 1.5L Milk * 500ml White Wine * 800g Tinned Tomatoes * 100g Flour * 100g Butter * 500g Lasagne Sheets * 250g Parmesan * 2 Balls of Mozzarella #160; * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. To start making the ultimate rag #250;, finely dice your onions and celery and grate the carrots. Glug some olive oil into a large heavy-based pan and then pour in the veg and give it a good stir so that they are coated in olive oil. Add a good pinch of salt and allow the veg to cook slowly until they are super soft and transparent. #160; 2. Once the onions, celery, and carrots have been sweated, whack the mince in and break it up into small pieces of meat. 3. Once the meat starts to brown, add in the nutmeg and bay leaves and allow it to cook for about 5 minutes. 4. Once the meat is brown all over pour in 500ml of milk into the pan and stir. Milk is the secret ingredient to making your rag #250; creamy and removing any acidity. Allow the milk to simmer away in the pan, this might take up to 30 minutes but be patient, it #8217;s worth it! 5. Once the milk has nearly evaporated away you can add in the white wine. Make sure all the meat is covered by liquid, you can always top it up with water if need be. Turn up the heat slightly and simmer. 6. Once the wine has evaporated just passed halfway, add in the two tins of tomato, stir and season well then allow it to simmer for at least an hour. The longer you leave it the better the flavour will get. But be careful to keep an eye on it as you don #8217;t want all the liquid to evaporate! 7. As the rag #250; simmers away its time to start on the white sauce. We need to make a roux which is the base to our sauce and is made up of the flour and butter. Add the butter into a large saucepan and allow it to melt down. Before it starts to pick up colour add in the flour and mix to form a paste. #160; 8. Allow the roux to cook for 1 minute and then slowly add in the remaining milk bit by bit while constantly stirring to ensure it doesn #8217;t go lumpy. Once all the milk has been mixed in, add 150g of grated parmesan into the sauce and then season it well. 9. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C. 10. Time to assemble the ultimate lasagne. Make sure you have a deep dish then the first layer of will be a light layer of white sauce, then the lasagne sheets so that the pasta doesn #8217;t stick to the dish. Add a layer of rag #250; on top of the pasta, then a layer of the white sauce and then close the layer with more lasagne sheets. Repeat until the last layer. 11. For the last layer, pour on the remaining white sauce and then put on the sliced mozzarella and parmesan to create the ultimate crispy cheesy coating. #160; 12. Once the lasagne is assembled place into the oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Take it out the oven and allow it to sit for 15 minutes before cutting into it! 13. Plate up this ultimate lasagne and tuck in! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/the-ultimate-lasagne](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/the-ultimate-lasagne)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The gooiest and zingyest brownies around. ## Cooking Time (Including Preparation Time): 45 Minutes and Chill Overnight ## Notes: #160; The butter and sugar mixture must be hot enough to melt the chocolate, don #8217;t take off the heat too early but make sure this does not burn. #160; ## Feeds: 12 People ## Ingredients: * 5 Eggs #160; * 350g Dark Chocolate (we use 70%) * 300g Unsalted Butter #160; * 400g Caster Sugar * 215g Self Rising Flour #160; * 90g Cocoa Powder #160; * 3 1/2 Tbsp Dried Chilli Flakes (if you #8217;re feeling brave go for that extra spoonful) * 100g Roasted Peanuts #160;(salted or roast) * Salt #160; #160; **To Serve:** #160; * 1 Lime * 1 Tsp Chilli Flakes #160; * 1 Tsp Salt ## Method: #160; 1. Preheat the oven to 185 #176;C/365 #176;F. 2. Whisk all the eggs in your biggest mixing bowl and break in the dark chocolate, put to the side. 3. On a medium heat, melt all the butter in a large saucepan (watch closely to make sure the butter doesn #8217;t start to brown). Once the butter is melted add the caster sugar, stirring frequently so the sugar doesn #8217;t stick to the pan. Remove from the heat when you have a nice, thick, golden consistency. 4. Then, pour the butter into the egg and chocolate mix. Stir consistently until the chocolate has melted and you have a deliciously rich batter. #160; 5. Next, sieve in your flour and cocoa powder, and mix until you get a smooth texture. 6. Then add your chilli flakes and peanuts and give it a final stir. 7. Now, time to line your baking tin (our tin dimensions were 28 x 18 x 18cm). Take your greaseproof paper and scrunch it up then flatten it out across your tin. 8. Pour your mixture in and bang on the kitchen surface to bring any air bubbles to the top. Then, using the back of a spoon even out the brownie surface and sprinkle with salt. 9. Bake for 25 mins until the brownies develop a very thin crust (the mixture will still have a slight wobble to it). 10. Transfer the brownies onto a cooling rack and leave to reduce to room temperature and begin to solidify. Chill in the fridge overnight or whack in the freezer for a couple of hours. 11. Once your brownies have chilled you #8217;re ready to serve. We recommend serving with a generous handful of lime zest, salt and chilli flakes for the ultimate flavour kick. #160;Then, tuck in! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/chilli-peanut-brownies](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/chilli-peanut-brownies)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This recipe has both a crunch and a cool zing, perfect for all seasons and occasions. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 mins ## Notes: #160; Throughout the dunking and coating, your semolina might get a bit messy. By weighing out two bowls you have a coating mixture to sub in if you need, for an even coating throughout. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: #160; * 675g Halloumi #160;(3 Packs) * 2 Eggs * 160g Semolina * A good amount of Sunflower or Vegetable Oil for frying **Dusting and Glazing:** * 2 Tbsp Sumac * 2 Tbsp Za #8217;atar * 2 Tbsp Sesame Seeds * 2 Tbsp Honey **Yoghurt:** * 140g Yoghurt * 3 Tbsp Pomegranate #160; * 1 Lemon * Bunch of Mint ## Method: #160; 1. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper then cut your halloumi into thick sticks (approximately finger width and length), and place on the tray. 2. Get 3 bowls, crack your eggs into one and whisk. In the other 2 bowls weigh out 80g of semolina in each. 3. Dunk the cheese sticks into your egg mixture then roll in your semolina. Make sure the halloumi has an even coating. 4. Repeat for all cheese sticks then lay on your baking tray and leave in the fridge for 30 mins to chill. #160; 5. Mix together your dusting dry ingredients - sumac, za #8217;atar, and sesame seeds then set aside. 6. Next, mix together your yoghurt ingredients. Pomegranate seeds, the juice of your lemon and a scattering of mint. #160; 7. In a wide and deep pan, get your oil frying. Pour in enough oil to cover your fries then test it #8217;s ready by dropping in some eggy semolina mixture. If it goes golden and crispy, you #8217;re ready. 8. Fry your coated halloumi in batches until golden and crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. #160; 9. Finally, glaze your halloumi with a generous squeeze of honey and sprinkle your dusting mix over the top. 10. Dunk your fries into the yoghurt and it #8217;s time to tuck in! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/herby-halloumi-fries](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/herby-halloumi-fries)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Taking your Dough Balls to the next level. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour ## Notes: Brushing your Dough Balls over with the garlic butter will create a nice golden glaze on your bake. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 2 Aubergines * 2 Onions * 2 1/2 Tsp Chilli Flakes * 1200g Tinned Tomatoes (3 Tins) * 2 Packets Dough Balls (we use PizzaExpress) * 2 Balls Mozzarella * 40g Parmesan * 1 Tsp Sugar * Bunch of Parsley * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. 2. Chop your aubergines into small chunks and add them to an oil-free, non-stick pan. Fry until charred then set aside. 3. Next for the tomato sauce. Heat a glug of oil in a pan and fry your onions until soft. Add a pinch of salt, 2 tsp chilli flakes, your fried aubergine and mix together. 4. Then add the tinned tomatoes and bubble on a high heat until you have a thick sauce. Add your sugar and a pinch of salt. 5. Once this is ready, chop up your parsley, add to the dish and season well. 6. Now, take your Dough Balls and place them on top of the aubergine sauce, setting the garlic dip aside. 7. Rip up 2 balls of mozzarella and place on top of the bake. 8. Then take the garlic butter and brush it over the tops of each Dough Ball to create a nice golden glaze. 9. Grate your parmesan all over the dish, season with pepper, drizzle with oil and sprinkle over 1/2 tsp chilli flakes. 10. Then, bake for 20 minutes until golden brown and the delicious tomatoey sauce has been soaked up. Remove from oven and dig in! **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/dough-balls-parmigiana](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/dough-balls-parmigiana) **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking for that spicy, zesty, healthy crunch this is the recipe for you. #160; #160; ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Notes: This recipe can be roasted or fried - just watch out not to burn the coating. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: #160; * 4 Chicken Breasts * 100g Panko Breadcrumbs #160; * 100g Flax Seeds * 25g Plain Flour #160; * 1 Tbsp White Sesame Seeds * 3 Tbsp Chilli Flakes #160; * 1 Tbsp Garlic Granules * 2 Lemons * 1 Egg * 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce * Salt #160; * Pepper * Olive Oil **Side Salad:** * 1/2 Cucumber * 5 Radishes * Bunch of Coriander #160; * Bunch of Mint * 50g Cashews * 1 Tbsp Fish Sauce * 2 Tsp Rice Vinegar * 2 Tsp Sugar * A handful of Desiccated Coconut #160; * Squeeze of Lime * Salt **Citrus Glaze:** * 2 Tsp Lemongrass Paste * 4 Tbsp Mayo ## Method: 1. Preheat oven at 180 #176;C/356 #176;F and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. #160; 2. Prepare chicken breasts. Place a sheet of greaseproof on your work surface and fold in half to sandwich each piece of chicken between the two layers. Using a rolling pin, bash the chicken 2-3 mm thick. Do this in batches. 3. Get three bowls. In bowl one, mix all the dry ingredients together (panko breadcrumbs, flax seeds, garlic granules, sesame seeds, chili flakes, zest of the lemons, salt, pepper). In bowl two, whisk the egg and the soy together. Last but not least, in a shallow bowl pour out your flour. #160; 4. Dip each chicken breast into the egg then into the flour. Dust off any excess flour and then roll your chicken in the breadcrumbs. Fill in any gaps with egg and crumb. #160; 5. Place your chicken breasts on your baking tray and drizzle with olive oil. Then bake depending on your fillet size, however, we recommend 30 minutes making sure to turn your chicken pieces halfway through your cooking time. You want your chicken golden with a crisp texture. 6. While your chicken is in the oven make your side salad. To start with, deseed and slice your cucumber. Thinly slice your radishes and chop your herbs (mint and coriander), mix in a generous amount of salt. #160; 7. Mix your fish sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar, coconut (saving some for garnish) and lime juice together. Then mix with your salad veg. 8. For your citrus mayo, mix up all your glaze ingredients - mayo, lemongrass and a dash of water. #160; 9. Chop your cashews then time to serve up. Thinly slice your chicken, spoon up some salad, a sprinkle of cashews and coconut, and drizzle of the citrus glaze. #160; **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/lemongrass-chicken-schnitzel](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/lemongrass-chicken-schnitzel)</TEXT>

Watch out for that oil splatter. #160; ## Feeds: 4 People #160; ## Ingredients: * 400g Okra * 50g Plain Flour #160; * 200g Gram Flour * 3 Tbsp Chilli Powder * 2 Tbsp Coriander #160; * 2 Tbsp Turmeric * 2 Tbsp Black Sesame Seeds * Pinch of Salt * Vegetable Oil (good amount for frying) **Dusting:** * 3 Tbsp Garam Masala #160; * 3 Tbsp Chilli Powder * 3 Tbsp Salt **Cool Dip:** * 50g Coconut Cream * Bunch of Coriander * Pinch of Sugar #160; * 1 Lime * 1 Kaffir Lime Leaf * 1 Tsp Ginger Paste * 1/2 Tsp Garlic Paste * 1 Green Chilli * Pinch of Salt #160; * Pepper ## Method: 1. Slice your okra in half lengthways and set aside. #160; 2. Whizz up all the ingredients for the cool dip (coconut, coriander, sugar, zest and juice of a whole lime, kaffir leaf, ginger paste, garlic paste, green chilli, pinch of salt and pepper) in a hand blender with 5 tbsp of water. Blend until smooth then set aside. 3. Mix all your dry ingredients together in a large bowl (plain flour, gram flour, chilli powder, coriander, turmeric, sesame seeds, pinch of salt) and then gradually whisk in 500ml of water to make sure your batter is not lumpy. 4. Get a deep frying pan or saucepan and fill with your oil on a medium heat. You need just enough oil to cover your fries. 5. Place your okra halves into your batter and coat evenly. 6. In batches, drop your okra into the oil and fry. Depending on how hot your oil is, it should take a couple of minutes for your fries to get golden and crispy (be careful with the spitting of oil when dunking your fries in). #160; 7. Remove and set the crispy fries on kitchen towel. #160; 8. Now it #8217;s time to mix the dusting ingredients together (garam masala, salt, and chilli powder) and roll your okra through. Be generous with the coating. 9. Place your fries in a bowl and get dunking with your cool dip! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/okra-fries](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/okra-fries)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lovely little brunch dish - the crispiest r #246;stis with smoked salmon, and a runny egg on top. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: #160; For the perfect poached egg, only cook one egg at a time and drop into a whirlpool of water. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 120g Alaska Smoked Salmon * 4 Eggs * 2 Medium Potatoes * 5 Shallots * 1 Heaped Tsp Horseradish * 1 Tbsp Cider Vinegar * Handful of Chives * Salt #160; * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1.  #65279;G #65279; #65279;rate the potatoes and squeeze out as much liquid as possible to make them nice and dry for frying. We used a tea towel to squeeze out the juice, but you can use anything you like. 2.  #65279;P #65279; #65279;lace the dry potato gratings into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. 3. Dice your shallots and add them to the bowl along with your horseradish and a drizzle of olive oil. 4. Toss this all together, then take a handful of the grated potato and form a thin potato patty. Repeat until you have run out of the mixture. 5.

    <TEXT>A lovely little brunch dish - the crispiest r #246;stis with smoked salmon, and a runny egg on top. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: #160; For the perfect poached egg, only cook one egg at a time and drop into a whirlpool of water. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 120g Alaska Smoked Salmon * 4 Eggs * 2 Medium Potatoes * 5 Shallots * 1 Heaped Tsp Horseradish * 1 Tbsp Cider Vinegar * Handful of Chives * Salt #160; * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1.  #65279;G #65279; #65279;rate the potatoes and squeeze out as much liquid as possible to make them nice and dry for frying. We used a tea towel to squeeze out the juice, but you can use anything you like. 2.  #65279;P #65279; #65279;lace the dry potato gratings into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. 3. Dice your shallots and add them to the bowl along with your horseradish and a drizzle of olive oil. 4. Toss this all together, then take a handful of the grated potato and form a thin potato patty. Repeat until you have run out of the mixture. 5.

    <TEXT># Recipe: A new take on carbonara using British Lion eggs, a zesty lemon, parmesan and mixed with a base of anchovies, capers, chilli  #64258;akes and a scatter of parsley. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 25 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure you reserve plenty of pasta water to get the perfect creamy carbonara consistency. ## Feeds: 4 people ## Ingredients: * 6 British Lion Egg Yolks #160; * 100g Parmesan * 1 Lemon, Zest * 9 Anchovies, Chopped (save the oil in the tin) * 1 Tsp Chilli Flakes * Large Handful of Capers * 2 Cloves of Garlic * Bunch of Parsley * 400g Linguine #160; * Salt #160; * Pepper * Olive oil ## Method: 1. Take two bowls and separate your British Lion egg yolks from the egg whites. (Set egg whites aside and use for meringues or cocktails. Visit #160;[eggrecipes.co.uk](http://eggrecipes.co.uk/) #160;for inspiration!) 2. Season your yolks with salt, a generous amount of pepper (around 4 pinches), lemon zest and grated parmesan (saving some for the garnish). Whisk together and set aside. 3. Chop your anchovies finely and add them, along with the anchovy oil saved from the tin and chilli flakes, to a pan over a medium heat. Cook until the anchovies dissolve and you get a thick brown paste which holds the  #64258;avour. 4. Once you get this paste, slice the garlic and add into the pan with the capers and a glug of olive oil. 5. Bring some water to the boil in a saucepan, add a pinch of salt and your linguine. 6. Once the pasta has been cooking for 5 minutes, remove around 200ml of pasta water and add 5 tbsp of it into the anchovy pan, letting it bubble down. 7. Keep an eye on your linguine and once it is al dente, drain and add to the anchovy pan along with your eggy mix and a further 3 tbsp of pasta water. Mix this all together. #160; 8. When the linguine is nice and silky, remove from the heat - if the sauce looks too thick add a bit more water. #160; 9. Finely chop up the parsley and toss this though the linguine (saving some for garnish). Serve up with a scatter of parsley, a grating of parmesan and a twist of black pepper.

    <TEXT>The naughtiest little pickle dressed up in a crispy mustardy shell with melted cheese and dipped in a special mustard sauce. Get on it MOB. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 40 Minutes ## Notes: Looking for an alternative to Edam slices, look for a flexible cheese that won #8217;t break when the gherkin is being wrapped. ## Feeds: 4 people ## Ingredients: * 1 Tbsp Mustard (we use French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard) * 100g Panko Breadcrumbs * 100g Flour * 6 Medium Sized Gherkins * 6 Edam Slices (any flexible cheese slices) * 2 Eggs * 1/2 Mozzarella Ball (alternatively grated cheddar cheese) * Salt * Pepper * Vegetable Oil **Mustard Dip** * 2 Tbsp Mustard (we use French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard) * 1 Tsp Pickle Brine * 1 Tbsp Mayo * 1 Tbsp Fresh Dill ## Method: 1. Fill a wok with enough oil to fully submerge your mustard pickles and get that on a medium heat. #160; 2. Crack the eggs in a bowl, add a dollop of mustard and whisk to combine. Put the panko breadcrumbs and flour in another two separate bowls and season them all with salt and pepper. 3. Neatly trim each end of the pickle to create a rectangle. Then, carefully hollow out the pickles. To do this use a teaspoon to start and then use a skewer and twist through the middle. There needs to be a consistent tunnel through each pickle. 4. Stuff each pickle with mozzarella, making sure there is an even layer of cheese throughout the pickle. Then, cut the pickles into three and stuff in anymore mozzarella if needed. 5. Roll and wrap the stuffed pickle in the Edam slice, cutting away any excess cheese at either side. #160; 6. Dip the wrapped pickle carefully in the flour, pat for an even flour covering. Then, dip the pickle into the mustard egg and finally carefully roll it in the panko breadcrumbs. 7. Using a metal slotted spatula (or slotted spoon) carefully place a few mustard pickles in the oil. You do not want to over crowd the pan, so only do a couple at a time. Keep turning the mustard pickle for an even fry. Once golden brown take the mustard pickles out and put onto a side plate. #160; 8. Once all your mustard pickles are cooked, mix all the mustard dip ingredients together. 9. To finish, season with salt and pepper. Dip and enjoy! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mustard-fried-pickles](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/mustard-fried-pickles)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The naughtiest little pickle dressed up in a crispy mustardy shell with melted cheese and dipped in a special mustard sauce. Get on it MOB. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 40 Minutes ## Notes: Looking for an alternative to Edam slices, look for a flexible cheese that won #8217;t break when the gherkin is being wrapped. ## Feeds: 4 people ## Ingredients: * 1 Tbsp Mustard (we use French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard) * 100g Panko Breadcrumbs * 100g Flour * 6 Medium Sized Gherkins * 6 Edam Slices (any flexible cheese slices) * 2 Eggs * 1/2 Mozzarella Ball (alternatively grated cheddar cheese) * Salt * Pepper * Vegetable Oil **Mustard Dip** * 2 Tbsp Mustard (we use French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard) * 1 Tsp Pickle Brine * 1 Tbsp Mayo * 1 Tbsp Fresh Dill ## Method: 1. Fill a wok with enough oil to fully submerge your mustard pickles and get that on a medium heat. #160; 2. Crack the eggs in a bowl, add a dollop of mustard and whisk to combine. Put the panko breadcrumbs and flour in another two separate bowls and season them all with salt and pepper. 3. Neatly trim each end of the pickle to create a rectangle. Then, carefully hollow out the pickles. To do this use a teaspoon to start and then use a skewer and twist through the middle. There needs to be a consistent tunnel through each pickle. 4. Stuff each pickle with mozzarella, making sure there is an even layer of cheese throughout the pickle. Then, cut the pickles into three and stuff in anymore mozzarella if needed. 5. Roll and wrap the stuffed pickle in the Edam slice, cutting away any excess cheese at either side. #160; 6. Dip the wrapped pickle carefully in the flour, pat for an even flour covering. Then, dip the pickle into the mustard egg and finally carefully roll it in the panko breadcrumbs. 7. Using a metal slotted spatula (or slotted spoon) carefully place a few mustard pickles in the oil. You do not want to over crowd the pan, so only do a couple at a time. Keep turning the mustard pickle for an even fry.

    <TEXT>This dish is all about the combination. Soft, roasted sweet potatoes. Garlicky kale. Crispy, salty capers. The creamiest tahini dressing. It's a belter. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 1 Hour 10 Minutes ## Notes: Fry your capers until they are crunchy to give this dish the edge. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 4 Sweet Potatoes * 180g Kale * 125g Capers * 6 Tbsp Tahini * 1 Lemon * 3 Tbsp Soy Sauce * 1.5 Tsp Sesame Oil * 6 Tsp Chilli Flakes * 3 Cloves of Garlic * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat your oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. 2. While your oven heats up, coat your sweet potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and 2 tsp of chilli flakes. Rub everything in and put them in the oven for 60 minutes. 3. Time for your dressing. Add your tahini into a bowl, with a 3 tsp of olive oil, your sesame oil and your soy sauce. Add 1.5 tsp of chilli flakes, the juice of a lemon and a pinch of pepper before adding 1.5 tbsp of water and mixing it all together until it becomes a smooth dressing. Once mixed, grate in the zest of the lemon and another sprinkling of pepper. 4. Heat a glug of olive oil in a frying pan and add your capers. Fry these on a high heat until they are crispy and remove them from your pan. In the same pan, add your kale, with another drizzle of olive oil. 5. Peel and slice your garlic cloves, then add them to the pan with 2 tsp of chilli flakes as well as a sprinkling salt and pepper. 6. Once cooked, remove your potatoes from the oven and slice them length-ways. Add on a good spoonful of your tahini dressing. Then stuff the potatoes with the fried kale and generously sprinkle the capers on top. Drizzle more tahini dressing over the top, with a sprinkling of your remaining chilli flakes and you #8217;re ready to tuck in!

    <TEXT>The burger game has changed. ## Cooking time (Includes preparation time): 35 minutes ## Notes: If you like spice, add some extra sriracha to the mayo. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 480g of Skinless, Boneless Salmon * 50g Panko Breadcrumbs * 4 Brioche Buns * 3 Tbsp Mayonnaise * 2 Tbsp White Miso * 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce * 2 Garlic Cloves * 2 Tbsp Sriracha * 1 Lime (zest and juice) * 1 Cucumber * 1 Tsp Caster Sugar * Knob of Ginger * 1 Tsp Salt * Olive Oil Method: 1. Roughly chop the salmon fillets. Put half into a food processor and blitz to a paste. Add the miso, ginger, lime zest, the rest of the salmon and 1 tbsp of soy sauce. Pulse very briefly until roughly combined. You want some nice chunky bits of salmon in with the paste rather than it all turned into mush. 2. Tip the mix into a bowl and stir through the panko breadcrumbs. Shape into four burgers and chill whilst you make the smacked cucumbers. 3. Now the fun part. Get a rolling pin or something heavy and hit the cucumber until it has collapsed and starts to break. Cut into random diagonal pieces. Place in a bowl and stir in the salt. Leave to sit for 10 minutes to draw out some of the water from the cucumber. 4. Dressing time. Grab a bowl. Crush in the garlic cloves and mix with 1 tbsp of Sriracha sauce, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, sugar and lime juice. 5. Mix the remaining Sriracha sauce with the mayonnaise. 6. Pour a drizzle of oil into a non-stick frying pan. Fry the salmon burgers for 3 minutes on each side. 7. Assemble time. Drain the water off the cucumbers and mix with the dressing. Cut the buns in half, (toast in the frying pan if you like), spread the bottom of each bun with the sriracha mayo. Top each with a salmon burger and pile on the smacked cucumber slaw. Drizzle over the dressing. Bam. **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/misosalmonburgers](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/misosalmonburgers)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard infused muffins with crispy bacon, juicy tomatoes and crunchy lettuce. Step up your brunch game. ## Cooking #160;Time (Includes #160;Preparation #160;Time): 15 Minutes ## Notes: You want your French #8217;s mustard muffin halves to get really caramelised and crispy, don #8217;t worry if it burns a little, crispy is good! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 3 Tbsp Mustard (we use French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard) * 4 English Muffins * 4 Eggs * 8 Rashers of Smoked Streaky Bacon * 4 Cheddar Cheese Slices * 2 Beef Tomatoes * 1 1/2 Tbsp Butter * 1/4 Iceberg Lettuce * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat the grill on medium (200 #176;C/400 #176;F). 2. Line a baking tray with foil and grill the streaky bacon until crisp. This should take about 5 minutes depending on the temperature of the oven. 3. Heat some oil in a frying pan and butter your English muffin halves. Then spread on an even drizzle of French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard on each slice (about 1 1/2 tsp per muffin) and fry each half - spread side down until nicely toasted, golden and deliciously mustardy. #160; 4. On the four toasted mustard bottom halves, lay down a cheese slice, put on a lined tray and grill until melted. 5. Prepare the rest of your sandwich components. Thinly slice your tomatoes and lettuce and on a high heat fry up each egg until nice and crispy. 6. Now it is time to layer up the French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard muffins with 2 slices of tomatoes, lettuce leaves, 2 bacon rashers, and the egg on top. Season with salt and pepper and last but not least the French #8217;s Classic Yellow mustard drizzle, all over the top of your open sandwich.

    <TEXT>## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Removing the soggy seedy centre of your cucumber will stop your couscous getting soggy! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs * 6 Tbsp Natural Yoghurt * 5 Tsp Harissa Paste * 400g Couscous * Bunch of Mint * Bunch of Coriander * 1/2 Cucumber * 1/2 Lime * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Roughly cut your chicken thighs into chunky strips and whack them in a bowl with 4 tbsp yoghurt and 3 tsp of harissa paste. Season this with salt and pepper, then massage the mixture into the chicken. 2. To cook your couscous, pour it into a large bowl and cover it in boiling water and leave this to absorb fully. Once absorbed, run a fork through the grains, separating them and fluffing it up. Cover this with a chopping board or a tea towel for five minutes. 3. Heat a healthy glug of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and then pop the chicken in, stirring occasionally and leaving to cook for around 20 minutes. 4. Chop your mint and coriander, and finely slice your cucumber. Add the herbs (saving some for garnish) and cucumber to the couscous bowl, and squeeze a generous amount of lime juice over the top. Toss this thoroughly, season with salt and pepper, and then toss further. 5. Plate up a portion of couscous, top with your finished chicken, and dollop on some yoghurt and harissa. To garnish, sprinkle a few more of your chopped herbs over it, and you #8217;re done! This dish is an instant crowdpleaser, so gather your mates together and enjoy! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/harissa-chicken](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/harissa-chicken)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes ## Notes: Removing the soggy seedy centre of your cucumber will stop your couscous getting soggy! ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs * 6 Tbsp Natural Yoghurt * 5 Tsp Harissa Paste * 400g Couscous * Bunch of Mint * Bunch of Coriander * 1/2 Cucumber * 1/2 Lime * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Roughly cut your chicken thighs into chunky strips and whack them in a bowl with 4 tbsp yoghurt and 3 tsp of harissa paste. Season this with salt and pepper, then massage the mixture into the chicken. 2. To cook your couscous, pour it into a large bowl and cover it in boiling water and leave this to absorb fully. Once absorbed, run a fork through the grains, separating them and fluffing it up. Cover this with a chopping board or a tea towel for five minutes. 3. Heat a healthy glug of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and then pop the chicken in, stirring occasionally and leaving to cook for around 20 minutes. 4. Chop your mint and coriander, and finely slice your cucumber. Add the herbs (saving some for garnish) and cucumber to the couscous bowl, and squeeze a generous amount of lime juice over the top. Toss this thoroughly, season with salt and pepper, and then toss further. 5. Plate up a portion of couscous, top with your finished chicken, and dollop on some yoghurt and harissa. To garnish, sprinkle a few more of your chopped herbs over it, and you #8217;re done!

    <TEXT>Crispy smokey bacon and delicious, golden, tender rosemary-ey chicken thighs. The freshest Dijon + L amp;Ps + mayo + Parmesan + cornichon sauce. A straight 10/10. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 Minutes #160; ## Notes: The juices from the meat will make frying the rolls extra tasty. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 8 Chicken Thighs (Skin On) * 5 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce * 2 1/2 Tbsp Dijon Mustard * 4 Garlic Cloves * 12 Rashers of Smoked Streaky Bacon * 1 Tsp Rosemary * 6 Tbsp Mayonnaise * 30g Parmesan * 2 Tbsp Cornichons * 1/2 Lemon * 4 Ciabatta Rolls * 2 Large Tomatoes * 1/2 Iceberg Lettuce * Salt * Pepper ## Method: 1. Debone the chicken, tear away any excess fat (but keep the skin on), and place the thighs into a bowl. Grate the garlic and add in along with 4 tbsp Worcester sauce, 1 level tbsp mustard, salt, pepper, and rub altogether. #160; Cover and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. 2. Sauce time. Thinly chop your cornichons and finely grate the parmesan. Add into a bowl with the mayo, 1 1/2 tbsp Worcester sauce, 1 1/2 tbsp mustard, salt, and pepper. Mix, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon and keep in the fridge until serving time. 3. Get a non-stick pan on a medium heat. Add in your bacon and fry. Cooking on a medium heat will allow the fat to render out. 4. Once crispy, move the bacon to the edge of the pan and place the marinated chicken thighs into the middle, skin side down. Fry for 4-5 minutes until the skin is nice and golden and then turn. Fry for another 3 minutes and set aside. 5. Finely chop the rosemary and add it into the pan. Fry for a couple of minutes then remove the chicken and bacon from the heat and cover until serving. Leave the juices in the pan. 6. Slice the ciabatta rolls in half and place face down in the pan with the leftover meat juices on a high heat. Fry for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. 7. Whilst the ciabatta is toasting, slice the remaining veg - lettuce and tomato. 8. Time to layer up. Spread the caesar sauce on the bottom bun, add a few lettuce leaves, a slice of tomato, 3 rashers of bacon, and 2 chicken thighs. Spread another layer of caesar sauce on the top bun and place the lid on.

    <TEXT>Charred chilli and za #8217;atar chops with a zesty, minty yoghurt sauce. A flavour combo from heaven. The tastiest chop you #8217;ll ever chomp on. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 40 Minutes ## Notes: You might want to turn the chops on their sides using a tong to crisp up the fatty edges. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 8 Lamb Chops * 9 Tbsp Plain Yoghurt * 1 1/2 Tbsp Za #8217;atar * 1 1/2 Tsp Chilli Powder * 1 Orange * 4 Cloves of Garlic * Handful of Mint * 1 Lemon * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Place your lamb chops, 4 tbsp yoghurt, za #8217;atar, chilli powder, and the zest of half an orange into a bowl. Grate in your garlic, salt, pepper and add a drizzle of olive oil then mix together until evenly coated. Cover and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. 2. Time for the sauce. Chop your mint (saving some for garnish) and add into another bowl along with the rest of your yoghurt, the zest of half an orange and a squeeze of orange and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Stir together and leave in the fridge until ready to use. 3.

    <TEXT>Taking Aglio e olio to the next level with deliciously wilted cavolo nero, topped with salty capers and parmesan. It #8217;s so simple and an absolute belter. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 20 Minutes ## Notes: It is important to not let your garlic begin to brown, stop this process by adding the pasta water. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 500g Cavolo Nero * 7 Cloves of Garlic * 1 Tbsp Chilli Flakes * 3 Tbsp Capers * 500g Spaghetti #160; * 50g Parmesan #160; * Salt * Pepper * 7 Tbsp Olive Oil #160; ## Method: 1.

    <TEXT>A flavour combo from heaven. The tomatoes bring a delicious sweetness. Such a fresh little dish. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 50 Minutes ## Notes: It is important that the cherry tomatoes do not disintegrate but keep their shape. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 400g Arborio Risotto * 2 Chicken Stock Cubes * 1 Large Onion #160; * 4 Garlic Cloves * 2 Tbsp Tomato Pur #233;e * 500g Cherry Tomatoes * 1 Tbsp Rosemary * 3 Tbsp Unsalted Butter * 100g Parmesan * Handful of Basil Leaves #160; * 1 Tsp Chilli Flakes * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil #160; ## Method: 1. Heat a tbsp of olive oil in a pan on a high heat and add in the cherry tomatoes. You want the tomatoes to char and become squidgy but not so much that they disintegrate. It is important to remove the tomatoes from the pan before they completely disintegrate. Set aside. 2. Finely chop the onion. Heat a glug of oil and a tbsp of butter and fry the onion until soft and translucent. 3. Thinly chop your rosemary and garlic. Add into the pan along with your tomato pur #233;e and chilli flakes and stir together. #160; 4. Toss through your rice until nicely coated and toast for about 2 minutes. 5. Dissolve the chicken stock in 1L of boiling water and pour a glug into the risotto. Once the rice has soaked this up, add more bit by bit. This is a process of beating and adding until all the stock is absorbed. By the end, your rice should be thick and creamy. 6. When this is done, re-add the majority of your cooked tomatoes (saving some for garnish). Grate 80g of parmesan, chop your basil and add in with 2 tbsp of butter, salt and pepper. Stir it all through. 7. Once combined and perfectly cooked. Turn off the heat, put the lid on and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Then, serve up and garnish with tomatoes, the leftover parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.

When this is done, re-add the majority of your cooked tomatoes (saving some for garnish). Grate 80g of parmesan, chop your basil and add in with 2 tbsp of butter, salt and pepper. Stir it all through. 7. Once combined and perfectly cooked. Turn off the heat, put the lid on and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Then, serve up and garnish with tomatoes, the leftover parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.

    <TEXT>A herby, spicy, sweet vegetable bowl, with a crunchy, zesty side salad topped with a garlicky red wine dressing and crispy capers. A flavour combo from heaven. ## Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 45 Minutes ## Notes: Make sure to save the tomato juices in the pan to reduce waste and make the dressing extra tasty. ## Feeds: 4 People ## Ingredients: * 5 Peppers (Yellow, Red, Orange) * 700g Cherry Tomatoes (Red, Orange) * Bulb of Garlic * 2 Tbsp Coriander Seeds * 2 Tsp Chilli Flakes * 2 Tbsp Fennel Seeds * Handful of Capers * 1 Fennel Bulb * 300g Quinoa * Handful of Parsley * 1 Lemon * 1 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil ## Method: 1. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. 2. Get 2 roasting trays, quarter the peppers and place them in one, then add in your tomatoes and the garlic bulb into another. Drizzle a good amount of oil over both trays and split the coriander, fennel seeds and chilli flakes between them. Season with salt and pepper and rub all the herbs and spices into the vegetables until you get an even coating. Roast for 45 minutes. 3. In another pan, heat enough oil to cover the base and pour in your capers. Fry for a few minutes until crispy, remove with a spoon and set aside. 4. Time for the salad. Prepare your quinoa according to packet instructions. Chop your parsley and thinly slice the fennel. 5. Once the quinoa is ready, add into the bowl along with the sliced fennel, chopped parsley and the juice of a lemon. Drizzle with olive oil, a good pinch of salt and pepper and toss together. Set aside. 6. Once 45 minutes is up, remove the peppers and tomatoes from the oven and move the tomatoes into the pepper tray, saving the leftover tomato juices. 7. Remove the garlic, peel back the skin and with a knife, squish out the roast garlic within. Once all the garlic is squeezed out, discard of the skins. Chop the garlic up until you have a nice smooth paste. Then, add into a bowl with the leftover tomato juices, red wine vinegar and a tbsp of olive oil. Give it a good stir. This is your dressing. 8. Time to serve up. Place your salad and roasted peppers and tomatoes into a bowl. Drizzle over with the garlicky dressing and crispy capers, then get involved! **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.facebook.com/mobkitchen/) **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchen/](https://www.instagram.com/mobkitchenuk/) **Youtube:** [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh\_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh_x46-uGGM7PN4Nrq1-bQ) **Full Recipe:** [http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/roast-tomato-pepper-bowl](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/roast-tomato-pepper-bowl)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>### Full Recipe: [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/pressed-picnic-sandwich](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/pressed-picnic-sandwich) ### Notes When building up the sandwich, make sure to layer on each ingredient individually. It will begin to get bulky but stick with it. We also used biodegradable eco clingfilm when pressing the layers together. Ingredients * **Serves** **4** * **5 Peppers (Red, Orange, Yellow)** * **2 Aubergines** * **1 Loaf of Ciabatta** * **Handful of Kalamata Olives** * **3 Balls of Mozzarella** * **4 Tbsp Pesto** * **10 Slices of Parma Ham** * **10 Large Slices of Salami** * **Salt** * **Pepper** * **Olive Oil** ### Step 1. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. ### Step 2. Roughly quarter the peppers and place in a baking tray. Drizzle over some olive oil and a big pinch of salt. Massage together and roast for 40 minutes. ### Step 3. Thinly slice your aubergine lengthways and whack it in a colander. Place the colander over a bowl and generously salt the slices. Leave for 20 minutes. This will draw out the moisture. ### Step 4. Meanwhile, prep the rest of your filling. Half the ciabatta. Pit the olives. Thinly slice the mozzarella balls. ### Step 5. Once the pepper is roasted, remove from the oven. Allow to cool, and then peel away the skins. ### Step 6. Once the aubergine is ready, pat dry to remove excess moisture. Heat a non-stick frying pan, and then add your aubergine. Do not add oil at this point. You want the aubergine to toast, not fry. Once soft and charred, remove from the heat. Add to a bowl, drizzle over a glug of olive oil and a pinch of pepper. Toss together and set aside. ### Step 7. Take your halved ciabatta loaf and spread a layer of pesto over the bottom half (about 2 tbsps). ### Step 8. Layer the fried aubergine slices on top of the pesto, then the sliced mozzarella. Tear the parma ham and layer on top, followed by the salami slices then the roasted pepper and finally the olives. Spread a layer of pesto on the top lid (about 2 tbsps) of the ciabatta and place it on the sandwich. ### Step 9. Tightly wrap the sandwich up in clingfilm and press it down using a heavy object. Leave pressed in the fridge overnight. ### Step 10. When ready, remove from the fridge, chop in half and tuck in!</TEXT>

Ingredients * **Serves** **4** * **5 Peppers (Red, Orange, Yellow)** * **2 Aubergines** * **1 Loaf of Ciabatta** * **Handful of Kalamata Olives** * **3 Balls of Mozzarella** * **4 Tbsp Pesto** * **10 Slices of Parma Ham** * **10 Large Slices of Salami** * **Salt** * **Pepper** * **Olive Oil** ### Step 1. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. ### Step 2. Roughly quarter the peppers and place in a baking tray. Drizzle over some olive oil and a big pinch of salt. Massage together and roast for 40 minutes. ### Step 3. Thinly slice your aubergine lengthways and whack it in a colander. Place the colander over a bowl and generously salt the slices. Leave for 20 minutes. This will draw out the moisture. ### Step 4. Meanwhile, prep the rest of your filling. Half the ciabatta. Pit the olives. Thinly slice the mozzarella balls. ### Step 5. Once the pepper is roasted, remove from the oven. Allow to cool, and then peel away the skins. ### Step 6. Once the aubergine is ready, pat dry to remove excess moisture. Heat a non-stick frying pan, and then add your aubergine. Do not add oil at this point. You want the aubergine to toast, not fry. Once soft and charred, remove from the heat. Add to a bowl, drizzle over a glug of olive oil and a pinch of pepper. Toss together and set aside. ### Step 7. Take your halved ciabatta loaf and spread a layer of pesto over the bottom half (about 2 tbsps). ### Step 8. Layer the fried aubergine slices on top of the pesto, then the sliced mozzarella. Tear the parma ham and layer on top, followed by the salami slices then the roasted pepper and finally the olives. Spread a layer of pesto on the top lid (about 2 tbsps) of the ciabatta and place it on the sandwich. ### Step 9. Tightly wrap the sandwich up in clingfilm and press it down using a heavy object. Leave pressed in the fridge overnight. ### Step 10. When ready, remove from the fridge, chop in half and tuck in!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fresh, minty tabbouleh topped with salty golden halloumi, creamy tahini and the sweetest pomegranate seeds. It #8217;s an absolute freshy. ### Notes Drain most of the tomato juice before adding to the bowl but keep a small stash - it's key for the consistency. ### Ingredients **Serves** **4** * **90g Bulgur Wheat** * **7 Medium Ripe Tomatoes** * **8 Spring Onions** * **1 Tsp Cinnamon** * **1 Tsp Ground Coriander** * **2 Lemons** * **60g Mint** * **250g Flat Leaf Parsley** * **2 Tbsp Tahini** * **1 Clove of Garlic** * **500g of Halloumi** * **A handful of Pomegranate Seeds** * **Salt** * **Pepper** * **Olive Oil** ### Step 1. Rinse the bulgur wheat until the water runs clear. Cook in a pan of boiling salted water (3 parts liquid) and simmer until absorbed. ### Step 2. Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes in half, remove any stems and spoon out the seeds so you are left with just the flesh. Finely dice the flesh then scoop up the tomatoes and drain away any excess moisture. Place into a large mixing bowl. ### Step 3. Finely chop the spring onion and add into the bowl. Squeeze in the juice and zest of a lemon and season with salt and pepper. Mix everything together. ### Step 4. Once the water has been absorbed by the bulgur wheat, cover and leave to steam for 2 minutes. Then fluff the grains with a fork then add into the large mixing bowl. Set the bowl aside. ### Step 5. Time for the tahini dressing. In a cup mix together the tahini, 2 tbsps of water, grate in the garlic, a tbsp of olive oil, salt, pepper, and the juice of a lemon. Keep adding water splash by splash until you have a nice creamy tahini dressing. ### Step 6. Slice the halloumi into thin chunks and add into a bowl. Season with olive oil, salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat and whack in the halloumi. Fry each piece of halloumi on both sides until golden brown and set aside. ### Step 7. While the halloumi is frying, finely chop your herbs (mint and parsley). It is important not to bruise them so try to chop them as finely as possible on the first chop through so that you don #8217;t have to go back and forth lots of times. Season and toss together. ### Step 8. Add the herbs and the spices (cinnamon and ground coriander) into the bulgur and tomato bowl. Season with salt, pepper, a tbsp olive oil and toss together. ### Step 9. Immediately serve up the herby tabbouleh (you don't want to leave it sitting around for too long). Top with your gollden halloumi, and drizzle on the tahini dressing. Scatter each plate with a few pomegranate seeds, season and enjoy!  #8203; Full Recipe: [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/halloumi-tabbouleh](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/halloumi-tabbouleh)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>### Notes The starch from the pasta emulsifies to the fats in the oil to create a creamy, rich coating for the pasta. ### Ingredients - Serves 4 * **Bunch of Parsley (100g)** * **500g Spaghetti** * **1 Tbsp Chilli Flakes** * **8 Cloves of Garlic** * **1 Lemon** * **Salt** * **Pepper** * **6 Tbsp Good Quality Olive Oil** ### Step 1. Boil a pan of water, salt it generously and then add your spaghetti. ### Step 2. Get a frying pan and heat 6 tbsps of olive oil. Finely slice your garlic and add to the pan with your chilli flakes. It is important to not let your garlic burn so keep stirring it on a low heat. ### Step 3. Once the pasta is al dente, reserve 7-8 tbsps of the starchy pasta water and add it into the garlic pan along with a pinch of salt. Stir together and lightly simmer. This is when the sauce will start coming together. ### Step 4. Chop your parsley (saving some for garnish) and drain the pasta. Add them both into the frying pan along with the juice from a lemon. Salt the dish and start tossing it all together to create an emulsion between the pasta water and olive oil. ### Step 5. Once everything is mixed in and the pasta is thick and almost creamy (from the pasta water), remove from the heat. Season and serve it up with extra chopped parsley on top as a garnish. Drizzle over some more olive oil. Enjoy! Full Recipe: [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/aglio-e-olio](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/aglio-e-olio)</TEXT>

The longer the yoghurt is left the thicker the consistency. ### Step 2. Once the Labneh is ready, it #8217;s time to prepare the broccoli. Cut the broccoli into small, bite size florets. ### Step 3. Get a non-stick frying pan with a tbsp of oil on a high heat and fry the broccoli until nicely charred. ### Step 4. While the broccoli is cooking, untie the cheesecloth and spoon the Labneh into a bowl. Add a squeeze of lemon, a tbsp of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. Mix together and set aside. ### Step 5. Roughly chop the toasted hazelnuts. ### Step 6. Serve the charred broccoli on a large platter and dollop over the spiced Labneh. Chop your dill and finish off each dish with a scattering of the dill, 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper and the chopped hazelnuts. Enjoy!

    <TEXT>### Notes Make sure to prepare the Labneh 1 day in advance. ### Ingredients Serves 4 ### LABNEH * **200g Greek Yoghurt** ### BROCCOLI * **400g Broccoli Florets** * **1 Lemon1** * **1/2 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper** * **200g Toasted Hazelnuts** * **Handful of Dill** * **Salt** * **Pepper** * **Olive Oil** ### Step 1. Start by making the Labneh. Line a measuring jug with a cheesecloth and spoon the greek yoghurt into the cloth. Pick up the edges of the cloth and tie at the top. Then leave the cloth in the measuring jug and place in the fridge for a day to allow the yoghurt to thicken. The Labneh can be left in the cheesecloth to drain for 24 to 48 hours. The longer the yoghurt is left the thicker the consistency. ### Step 2. Once the Labneh is ready, it #8217;s time to prepare the broccoli. Cut the broccoli into small, bite size florets. ### Step 3. Get a non-stick frying pan with a tbsp of oil on a high heat and fry the broccoli until nicely charred. ### Step 4. While the broccoli is cooking, untie the cheesecloth and spoon the Labneh into a bowl. Add a squeeze of lemon, a tbsp of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. Mix together and set aside. ### Step 5. Roughly chop the toasted hazelnuts. ### Step 6. Serve the charred broccoli on a large platter and dollop over the spiced Labneh. Chop your dill and finish off each dish with a scattering of the dill, 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper and the chopped hazelnuts. Enjoy!

    <TEXT>### Notes The more ingredients you have in the broth the more flavoursome it will be. ### Ingredients Serves 4 * **2 Large Butternut Squash** * **2 Tbsp Curry Powder** * **2 Level Tbsp** * **White Miso** * **1 Tbsp Sesame Oil** * **2 Tsp Chilli Oil** * **1 Vegetable Stock Pot** * **1 Large Knob of Ginger** * **4 Cloves of Garlic** * **3 Pak Choi** * **2 Corn On The Cobs** * **4 Eggs** * **400g Instant Packet Noodles** * **Salt** * **Vegetable Oil** ### Step 1. Begin by preheating the oven to 180 #176;C. ### Step 2. Peel both of your butternut squashes. Deseed and chop into chunks. ### Step 3. Add the squash into a roasting tray with a glug of vegetable oil, a big pinch of salt and a tbsp of curry powder. Mix together and whack it into the oven for 40 minutes until the squash is soft and tender. Stir halfway through. ### Step 4. At this point, remove 2/3 #8217;s of the butternut squash from the oven and pop the remaining 1/3 back in for another 15 minutes until it becomes browned and caramelised. ### Step 5. Add the 2/3 #8217;s of the squash into a blender along with the white miso, 1 tbsp of curry powder, sesame oil, chilli oil and the vegetable stock pot. Add in a small splash of water and blitz until you have a fine butternut squash paste. ### Step 6. Finely chop the knob of ginger and grate the garlic cloves. Add the ginger and garlic into a deep saucepan with a splash of vegetable oil. Fry on low to medium heat. Just before it begins to colour add the butternut paste and cook for around a minute. ### Step 7. Just before the butternut paste starts to catch add in 1.8L of boiling water. Stir it together and bubble down on a medium heat until you have a thick broth consistency (looser than a soup). ### Step 8. Meanwhile, quarter your pak choi. Get a griddle pan on the heat and when hot add in the quartered pak choi and corn on cobs (if you do not have a griddle pan use a non-stick frying pan without oil). Griddle for 3-4 minutes on both sides until charred. Once cooked set aside. ### Step 9. Time to boil the eggs. Boil for 5 minutes, remove and add into a bowl of icy water to stop the eggs from cooking. Remove after a few minutes and peel away the shell. ### Step 10. Get your instant packet noodles and chuck them into the broth. Cook for 3-4 minutes. ### Step 11. Serving time. Into a bowl, add a handful of noodles and fill with ramen broth. Cut the corn off the cob (making sure it stays together) and add into the bowl along with the pak choi. Chop your runny egg in half and add on top. Drizzle over with more chilli oil and enjoy!  #8203; Full Recipe: [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/roast-butternut-miso-ramen](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/roast-butternut-miso-ramen)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crispy goujons paired with lemony, herby and salty tartare sauce. Sublime. Recipe by MOB Contributor Thomas Straker. ### Notes Fry your fish in batches to avoid over cramming. ### Ingredients - Serves 4 * **2 Lemons** * **Salt** * **Pepper** **FISH GOUJONS** * **600g Cod Fillet** * **200g Panko Breadcrumbs** * **2 Eggs** * **100g Flour** * **2L Vegetable Oil** **MAYONNAISE** * **2 Egg Yolks** * **30g Dijon Mustard** * **40ml White Wine Vinegar** * **150ml Olive Oil** * **150ml Vegetable Oil** * **30ml Water** **TARTARE SAUCE** * **3 Tbsp Cornichons** * **3 Tbsp Shallots** * **3 Tbsp Capers** * **1 Lemon** * **3 Tbsp Parsley**  #8203; Method: ### Step 1. Starting with the cod, cut it into even sized goujons. ### Step 2. Get 3 bowls. Put your flour into the first, whisked eggs into the second and breadcrumbs in the last. Season the bowls with salt and pepper. ### Step 3. Dip the fish into the flour then egg then breadcrumbs. Make sure it is evenly coated and repeat for all the fillets. Place the battered fish onto a tray and set aside in the fridge until you are ready to use. ### Step 4. Mayo time. Place the egg yolks, mustard and white wine vinegar into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Beat together with a whisk and keep beating whilst you add all of the oil bit by bit (olive and vegetable). If it gets too thick before you #8217;ve finished adding the oil, loosen with a small splash of water, then add the rest of the oil. ### Step 5. Now for the tartare. Prepare all the ingredients - dice your shallots and cornichons, juice the lemon, grate the zest and roughly chop your capers and parsley. Mix together with the mayo (made in step 5) then place in the fridge until you are ready to use it. ### Step 6. For the burnt lemons, cut 2 lemons in half, get a frying pan on a high heat and place them in the pan cut side down. When they begin to burn on the bottom, remove. ### Step 7. Pour 2L of vegetable oil into a large pan on a medium-high heat. You want it nice and hot (around 180 #176;C but not smokey), then drop in the goujons and fry until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. ### Step 8. Arrange on a plate and serve with dollop fresh tartare sauce, a wedge of lemon and a sprinkle of salt. Enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>### Notes The key to this burger is to buy the best quality meat you can. Freshly ground from a butcher is always best, especially as you can often pick the fattiest cut - the higher the fat content, the juicier the burgers. ### Ingredients - Serves 4 * **4 Brioche Buns** * **8 Slices of Red Leicester Cheese or Cheddar** * **1 Large Jar of Pickles** * **Vegetable Oil** * **CARAMELISED ONIONS** * **2 Medium Onions** * **Salt** * **Olive Oil** **CRISPY SHALLOTS** * **2 Shallots** * **1 Tbsp Cornflour** * **500 ml Vegetable Oil (For Frying)** **BURGER SAUCE** * **1 Shallot** * **3 Tbsp Sweet Pickle Relish or Pickles** * **4 Tbsp Mayonnaise** * **2 Tbsp Ketchup** * **2 Tbsp French #8217;s Mustard** * **1 Pinch of Cayenne Pepper** * **Salt** **BEEF PATTY** * **800g Beef Mince** * **Salt** * **Pepper** **Method** ### Step 1. Start with the caramelised onions. Peel and finely slice the onions. Place a saucepan over a medium heat, add in a glug of olive oil and the onions. Cook slowly for 5 minutes until soft, add a good pinch of salt and then cook until caramelised for a further 5-10 minutes. Remove from the pan then set aside until required. ### Step 2. Finely slice your shallots. Add your cornflour into a bowl and toss the shallots through. Heat your vegetable oil to around 150 #176;C in a pan and fry the shallots until golden brown. Drain on kitchen towel and season with salt. Set aside. ### Step 3. Time for the burger sauce. Dice the shallots and mix with all the other ingredients in a bowl. Set aside in the fridge until you are ready to use. ### Step 4. For the beef patty, season the meat with salt and pepper and shape into four equal sized patties. ### Step 5. Heat a heavy based frying pan. Cut the buns in half and toast in the hot dry pan on each side until dark golden. When toasted remove and set aside. ### Step 6. In the same hot pan, add in a glug of vegetable oil. Season the burger patties with salt and put in a hot pan for around 2 minutes. While cooking, press the patty down firmly to get good crispy edges (if you are using a small pan do not overcrowd, as you want to get good caramelisation on the patty.) ### Step 7. Flip the patty, add 2 slices of cheese to the top of the patty and put a lid on the pan to let the cheese melt. ### Step 8. Time to layer up. Slice your pickles and spread burger sauce on the bottom of the bun. Add the sliced pickles, then caramelised onions, the burger patty, followed by more burger sauce and finally the crispy shallots. Add your brioche lid on top and tuck in!  #8203; Full Recipe: [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/the-ultimate-cheese-burger](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/the-ultimate-cheese-burger)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>### Notes The key to this burger is to buy the best quality meat you can. Freshly ground from a butcher is always best, especially as you can often pick the fattiest cut - the higher the fat content, the juicier the burgers. ### Ingredients - Serves 4 * **4 Brioche Buns** * **8 Slices of Red Leicester Cheese or Cheddar** * **1 Large Jar of Pickles** * **Vegetable Oil** * **CARAMELISED ONIONS** * **2 Medium Onions** * **Salt** * **Olive Oil** **CRISPY SHALLOTS** * **2 Shallots** * **1 Tbsp Cornflour** * **500 ml Vegetable Oil (For Frying)** **BURGER SAUCE** * **1 Shallot** * **3 Tbsp Sweet Pickle Relish or Pickles** * **4 Tbsp Mayonnaise** * **2 Tbsp Ketchup** * **2 Tbsp French #8217;s Mustard** * **1 Pinch of Cayenne Pepper** * **Salt** **BEEF PATTY** * **800g Beef Mince** * **Salt** * **Pepper** **Method** ### Step 1. Start with the caramelised onions. Peel and finely slice the onions. Place a saucepan over a medium heat, add in a glug of olive oil and the onions. Cook slowly for 5 minutes until soft, add a good pinch of salt and then cook until caramelised for a further 5-10 minutes. Remove from the pan then set aside until required. ### Step 2. Finely slice your shallots. Add your cornflour into a bowl and toss the shallots through. Heat your vegetable oil to around 150 #176;C in a pan and fry the shallots until golden brown. Drain on kitchen towel and season with salt. Set aside. ### Step 3. Time for the burger sauce. Dice the shallots and mix with all the other ingredients in a bowl. Set aside in the fridge until you are ready to use. ### Step 4. For the beef patty, season the meat with salt and pepper and shape into four equal sized patties. ### Step 5. Heat a heavy based frying pan. Cut the buns in half and toast in the hot dry pan on each side until dark golden. When toasted remove and set aside. ### Step 6. In the same hot pan, add in a glug of vegetable oil. Season the burger patties with salt and put in a hot pan for around 2 minutes. While cooking, press the patty down firmly to get good crispy edges (if you are using a small pan do not overcrowd, as you want to get good caramelisation on the patty.) ### Step 7. Flip the patty, add 2 slices of cheese to the top of the patty and put a lid on the pan to let the cheese melt. ### Step 8. Time to layer up.

    <TEXT>### Notes Be patient whilst charring the cabbage. The more the cabbage is moved the less defined the charred lines will be and we want those lines nice and charred. Place a small frying pan or saucepan on top of the cabbages. ### Ingredients - Serves 4 * **2 Hispi Cabbages** * **1 Tbsp Sesame Oil** * **2 Tbsp Miso Paste** * **3 Tbsp Tahini** * **2 Tbsp Soy Sauce** * **2 cm Ginger** * **2 Tbsp Mirin** * **Handful of Sesame Seeds** * **Handful of Coriander** ### Step 1. Preheat the oven to 180 #176;C. ### Step 2. Get your griddle pan on and prepare the cabbages. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage and slice into half then into quarters. Brush the quarters with sesame oil and when the griddle pan is hot, add in the cabbage quarters, two at a time, until nicely charred. Turn the cabbages half way through and brush each side with extra oil. ### Step 3. Once griddled, put all the cabbage halves into a baking tray and lightly roast in the oven for 8 minutes. ### Step 4. For the dressing, mix together the miso, tahini, soy, grated ginger, mirin and a splash of water. ### Step 5. Separate the coriander leaves and stalks. Plate up the cabbage and drizzle over your miso dressing. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and coriander leaves on top then tuck in!

    <TEXT>***Notes*** If you don't have enough apples, this would also be delicious with some rhubarb, pears or berries chucked in to stew with the apples.  #8203; ***Ingredients - Serves 4*** * 1.2kg Bramley Apples * 80g Soft Brown Sugar * 1 Lemon * 75ml Water * 200g Plain Flour *  #189; Tsp Cinnamon * Pinch of Nutmeg * 170g Cold Butter * 50g Soft Brown Sugar * 80g Demerara Sugar * 75g Rolled Oats * Vanilla Ice Cream, To Serve ***Method*** 1. **Step 1**. Heat your oven to 200 #176;C/400 #176;F. 2. **Step 2.** Make your filling. Peel and core your apples, then dice into 2cm chunks. Place 3/4 of your apples into a medium sized saucepan along with your sugar, the juice from your lemon and your water. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat, then cook for 15 mins until breaking down and turning nice and saucy. Add your remaining apples and stir to combine - these will hold their shape when the crumble bakes to give you juicy apple chunks. Set aside. 3. **Step 3.** Dice your butter into 1/2cm chunks. Pour your flour, cinnamon and nutmeg into a large bowl, then add your butter and rub through with your fingertips until your butter has all broken down and coated your flour - this mixture should resemble fine yellow breadcrumbs. Add your oats, soft brown sugar and demerara sugar (reserving 2 tbsp for later), then continue to rub in until your mixture resembles small pebbles. Pop your bowl in the fridge to rest for 15 mins - this will ensure it stays biscuity and crisp when baked. 4. **Step 4.** Transfer your apple mixture to a pie dish, then top with your crumble mixture. Sprinkle with your remaining demerara sugar.Step 5. Bake for 25-30 mins until you have a golden and crisp top. Serve with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and dig in.

    <TEXT>***Notes*** If you don't have enough apples, this would also be delicious with some rhubarb, pears or berries chucked in to stew with the apples.  #8203; ***Ingredients - Serves 4*** * 1.2kg Bramley Apples * 80g Soft Brown Sugar * 1 Lemon * 75ml Water * 200g Plain Flour *  #189; Tsp Cinnamon * Pinch of Nutmeg * 170g Cold Butter * 50g Soft Brown Sugar * 80g Demerara Sugar * 75g Rolled Oats * Vanilla Ice Cream, To Serve ***Method*** 1. **Step 1**. Heat your oven to 200 #176;C/400 #176;F. 2. **Step 2.** Make your filling. Peel and core your apples, then dice into 2cm chunks. Place 3/4 of your apples into a medium sized saucepan along with your sugar, the juice from your lemon and your water. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat, then cook for 15 mins until breaking down and turning nice and saucy. Add your remaining apples and stir to combine - these will hold their shape when the crumble bakes to give you juicy apple chunks. Set aside. 3. **Step 3.** Dice your butter into 1/2cm chunks. Pour your flour, cinnamon and nutmeg into a large bowl, then add your butter and rub through with your fingertips until your butter has all broken down and coated your flour - this mixture should resemble fine yellow breadcrumbs. Add your oats, soft brown sugar and demerara sugar (reserving 2 tbsp for later), then continue to rub in until your mixture resembles small pebbles. Pop your bowl in the fridge to rest for 15 mins - this will ensure it stays biscuity and crisp when baked. 4. **Step 4.** Transfer your apple mixture to a pie dish, then top with your crumble mixture. Sprinkle with your remaining demerara sugar.Step 5. Bake for 25-30 mins until you have a golden and crisp top. Serve with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and dig in.

    <TEXT>Notes - We've used ingredients here that you should be able to find at your local shop, but for extra authenticity, sub your ginger out for galangal and add a teaspoon of shrimp paste to your curry paste. **Ingredients - Serves 4** FOR THE CURRY PASTE * 3 Shallots * 3 Stalks of Lemongrass * 4 Green Finger Chillis * 3 Cloves of Garlic * 2cm Piece of Ginger * Zest of  #189; Lime * Handful of Coriander Leaves and Stems * 1 Tsp Fish Sauce  #8203; FOR THE SAUCE * 600g Chicken Thigh Fillets * 1 Aubergine * 400ml Coconut Milk * 200ml Chicken Stock * 125g Green Beans * 1 Tsp Brown Sugar * Juice of 1/2 Lime * 1 Tsp Fish Sauce * Handful of Coriander Leaves * Salt * Vegetable Oil **Method** Step 1. Roughly chop your shallots, lemongrass, lime zest, chillies, garlic, ginger and coriander. Step 2. Place all of these ingredients into your food processor with half of your fish sauce and a splash of vegetable oil, then blitz to a rough puree. You can also do this in a pestle and mortar. Set aside. Step 3. Chop your chicken into strips and slice your aubergine into 1cm wide half moons. Step 4. Heat a splash of vegetable oil in a large pan over a medium-high heat, then add your chicken. Brown off for 3-5 mins, then remove from the pan. Add your aubergine chunks, along with another splash of vegetable oil, then fry over a medium heat for 4 mins until your aubergine is totally soft. Step 5. Add all of your curry paste to the aubergine pan and cook out for a few minutes until it is fragrant. You might see some oil separate out from the curry paste, but don't be alarmed - this is normal. Add your coconut milk and chicken stock and stir to combine, then bring up to a boil. Add your chicken and green beans to the pan, then simmer over a medium heat for 15 mins until your sauce has thickened and your chicken and vegetables are tender. Your kitchen will smell amazing at this point. Add your sugar, lime juice and remaining fish sauce, then season to taste with salt. Step 6. Serve your curry over rice and sprinkle with coriander leaves.

    <TEXT>Notes - *Don #8217;t be scared of the amount of garlic - it the flavour softens in the oven to become sweet and caramelised. 4 whole bulbs really is the perfect amount - just make sure you roast it for long enough to get that mellow flavour.* # Ingredients - Serves 4 * 4 Bulbs of Garlic * 700g Puff Pastry * 200g Pancetta * 1kg Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs * 20g Butter * 1 Onion * Sprig of Rosemary * Sprig of Thyme * 40g Flour * 500ml Chicken Stock * 200ml Whole Milk * 1 Egg * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil # Method Step 1. Heat your oven to 180 #176;C/356 #176;F. Wrap your bulbs of garlic in baking parchment, then place on a baking tray and roast for 45 mins. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Squeeze your garlic out of it #8217;s skin by pressing a knife down on it. Discard the skins, saving the caramelised flesh until later. Step 2. Take two thirds of your pastry and roll it out to 2mm thickness. Line your pie dish with your pastry, folding it into the edges on the base and pressing into the sides so that it sits snug against the sides of the dish. Line with a square of parchment and fill with baking beans, uncooked rice or uncooked pulses. Step 3. Pop your pie dish in the oven for 10 mins until your sides have puffed up and crisped slightly. Carefully remove your baking beans and parchment, then whack in the oven for 5 minutes longer until you have a crisp base. Turn up the oven to 190 #176;C/374 #176;F. Step 4. Chop your chicken into 2 inch pieces. Slice your onion. Step 5. Heat a large saute pan over a medium heat. Add a little olive oil, then tip in half of your chicken thigh chunks. Season with salt and pepper and fry over a high heat for 5 mins until it has gone nice and golden. Remove from the pan, then repeat with your remaining chicken. Step 6. In your empty pan, add your butter and let it melt. Tip your onions into the same pan along with your rosemary and thyme sprigs. Cook over a medium heat for about 6 mins until totally soft. Add your pancetta and turn up the heat, frying until your pancetta is crispy and the onions are caramelised. Step 7. Add your flour and cook out for 2 mins until it starts to smell biscuity, then gradually pour in your stock in small increments, whisking all the while to ensure you have a smooth sauce. Once your stock has finished, do the same with your milk. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 2 mins until your sauce has thickened. Step 8. Add your chicken and roasted garlic to the pan along with some salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Simmer for 2 mins. Step 9. Pour your filling into a pie dish and top with your pastry. Beat your egg and brush this over the top of your pastry. Place on a baking sheet in the oven and bake for 25-30 mins. Serve up by itself, or alongside some mash and greens.  #8203; Full Recipe: [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/roasted-garlic-chicken-pie](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/roasted-garlic-chicken-pie)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Notes - The mascarpone adds a lovely richness, but feel free to replace it with whatever creamy goodness you have kicking about in the fridge.* Ingredients - Serves 4 * 1 Butternut Squash * 1 Onion * 1 Clove of Garlic * Handful of Rosemary * 1 Tsp Chilli Flakes * 25g Panko Breadcrumbs * 6 Pork Sausages *  #189; Tsp Fennel Seeds * 300ml Chicken Stock * 500g Fresh Gnocchi * 150g Mascarpone * 30g Parmesan * Salt * Pepper * Olive Oil **Method:** Step 1. Peel your butternut squash and chop it into 1-inch cubes. Place into a roasting tin with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper and toss with your hands to coat. Roast for 30 minutes until tender and caramelised, turning every so often to ensure they cook evenly. Step 2. Whilst your squash cooks, finely chop your onion, garlic and rosemary. Step 3. Heat a small glug of olive oil in a small frying pan. Add half of your chilli flakes and rosemary along with your panko breadcrumbs and fry for a few minutes until golden, crispy and smelling glorious. Set aside. Step 4. Heat a little olive oil in a large frying pan and add the meat from your sausages. Fry over medium-high heat for 5 mins until cooked and golden, breaking up with the back of your spoon so you get lots of individual chunks. Step 5. Add your onion to the pan and turn down the heat to medium. Fry for 10 minutes until softened, then add your garlic, the rest of your rosemary, your remaining chilli flakes and fennel seeds. Cook for another 2 minutes. Add your chicken stock and bring to a simmer, then tip in your gnocchi and simmer for 5 minutes. Give your mixture a good stir, then add your butternut squash, mascarpone and parmesan to the pan. Stir to combine, then season to taste. Step 6. Serve with a sprinkling of your breadcrumbs and a little more parmesan.  #8203; **Full Recipe:** [https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/creamy-sausage-and-squash-gnocchi](https://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/recipes/creamy-sausage-and-squash-gnocchi)</TEXT>
