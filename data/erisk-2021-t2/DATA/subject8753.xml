    <TEXT>As most people who are gonna tell you your husband was *trying* to cheat I'm gonna agree. But atleast sit down with him, ask him what's the problem, let him rant and vent and say everything he wants, like just let him spit it all out what's making him insecure ya know? Then take the lead and tell him how you felt. Tell him everything. Tell him how much he means to you now, how much the family makes you contended, how much of an awesome husband he's been upto this point and how you're looking forward for a bright future together. He hasn't cheated on you yet and I'm sure he probably wasn't going to. He was insecure so he sent some shady texts, a man generally can't say these things unless someone helps them to get it out. He's insecure of your stuff you did in past and exes right? So why not just talk to him. What do you got to lose from this? Nothing. I am sure you and your husband will be fine just sit down and fix this step by step speaking in turns. Goodluck :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I (18M) am struggling with relationships.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 07:53:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just a bit of a background, I'm a very nice person if you're close to me but towards the initial face to face contact with me first time as a person around my age I tend to be awkward, like very awkward. I don't have good looks, not very tall either and all my life I had friends but last few years have been very different. I'm running out of friends to hang out with and even talk to because of my own attitude to the relationships I form. My question is, is it important to have friends to be happy and lead a stable life? And if it's important then how important it is? And lastly how do I make friends? Are there simple ways I can initiate conversation and get close to people? Just FYI I don't have very good relationship with my family members too both close and "not so close" ones because of my personality, I prefer to be alone but I'm definitely feeling this thing that I might need atleast 2 or 3 people I can call friends. What's your opinion? TL:DR: Can't form strong relationships because I'm an introvert, don't need any either but I feel like I'll be lonely and sad soon if I don't have a few friends.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why did my(M18) my girlfriend (F18) of 1.5 years stop calling me "daddy" and justify it by saying that this kind of kinky only for casual relationships?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 08:10:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So about 5 months back my girlfriend stopped using the word "daddy" on me and as you saw from the title she says it's only for "casual relationships" and we're supposed to be a "serious relationship". Is that a justifying reason or is she just not attracted to me as a man anymore? I've opened up to her about stuff much more around that time and some of my friends suggest she thinks she as the upper hand on me now because she knows my weaknesses and insecurities. Is it possible for a woman to stop seeing a man as a "real man" once the latter opens up about stuff he did not agree to open about before? I've been insecure a lot about this and I can't help but feel pushed aside even though it's an unimportant issue. Am I not being man enough for her because I opened up? TL;DR: Girlfriend stopped using kinky names with excuses like "serious relationships don't do that" and I'm insecure it's because of me not being man enough.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I really wanna die</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 06:25:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just don't feel any interest towards anything anymore. Ever since my girlfriend cheated I feel like I'm disposable goods. I have been feeling like this for about 9 months since she did this and I still have not recovered. I can not sleep, can not eat, stare at the wall blankly for minutes then snap back into reality. It's becoming difficult to make myself feel excited about something again. I really wouldn't care if this virus or some accident kills me tomorrow, I really don't care. I don't wanna suicide because its gonna make my parents nervous and people around me will think im weak and I gave up, but if there's a different way I'm gonna die soon, I wouldn't try to avoid it at all.</TEXT>
