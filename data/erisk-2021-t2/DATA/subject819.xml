    <TEXT>the power and volume switch you could probably get pinned to the pi but you have to write script to get those to work. Im working to get my power switch wired to a switching power brick, so itll turn everything back on after shutdown. You can actually reuse all your old buttons, however youll run into problems with the joystick because its a 2 piece cable essentially. Youll either need a different 5 pin ribbon cable or switch the joystick so itll work with the encoders. I used a pi image already made. It has 2 games i wanted. mvc2 and area 51/max force. Im building an a51 cab, so ill be looking for a lightgun image</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont know if the pi4 pinout is the same as the pi3, i went a different route. I wired my switch to a power brick with a relay so when i power down the pi switch it off and everything goes with it. I tried wiring up a pi3 to make everything work, to me adding the script was more of a pain than it was worth.To each their own but I wanted to keep it simple. Some people have even wired a standalone switch to a regular power strip and had good success with that.</TEXT>

If you reuse your original sticks you will need to find a 5 pin cable to be able to pin it to an encoder if you go the pi route. The only other thing I did was went with a pi4, so Just ordered buttons, joysticks, encoders, wiring, and video converter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Overclocking is easy on the pi4, that was my initial concern. In the menu, you can actually select overclock and choose your parameters. My case has a fan so im comfortable running 1750hz. dependingnon the image you can go as high as 2000, but run a good fan. I chose the icetower fan, its like 20 bucks and you wont have to worry about overheat. I set mine at 1750 and its been played nonstop for 7 months, no problems</TEXT>

Trust me when i say this go with the 4, itll run a lot more demanding games. as far as the control deck, you have 2 options. either drill out the holes with what i believe is a 30mm hole saw, or some people will mod it for you. 80 or 90 bucks to have someone drill it and install the buttons. since both are 2 player, they both had the 6 button layout so no worries. all i did was buy a slide in j panel that has cuts for coin buttons and 4 inch speakers</TEXT>
