    <TEXT>In the song that Yellow Diamond sings, there's this one part about Lapis' are for teraforming? Terraforming, by definition, apparently to literally, "Earth-shaping". Terraforming of a planet, moon, or other body is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying its atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the environment of Earth to make it habitable by Earth-like life. I think the Diamonds would've definitely tried to create a planet like Earth in order to retrieve the abundance of resources and create more gems. I feel like this also justifies our Lapis' power over water which makes up about 70% of the Earth.</TEXT>

But I feel like almost everyone is automatically assuming the worst, and that their relationship is going to be toxic or horrible. We've barely gotten to see what their interactions as a couple are, and people are so sure that it's gonna go south. I mean, sure, starco is endgame BUT STILL. Give Tomstar a chance. Give the WRITERS a chance. Seriously. People are already blaming this situation on bad writing. I get it, the salt is strong for starco and jarco, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the writers are at fault. They definitely have a much better idea of what the show needs for future plot and character development. Personally I feel that season 3 has been solid so far, with star's growth and jarco's breakup being executed beautifully. Let's believe in the writers that they will handle Tomstar just as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m honestly surprised at the lack of popularity Kimetsu no Yaiba has. Or more so that most people have no clue that this series exists. Considering it #8217;s sky rocketing sales and it being an established WSJ title, I find it really strange how little popularity it has compared to some other titles that are far from the volume sales that KnY has produced. I understand everyone has different tastes, but I still find it odd that most people don #8217;t even know about the series??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We #8217;re at nearly 2.5k subscribers (omg?) and we #8217;re growing every day. I remember when this was a baby sub #8230; Anyway, it #8217;s time for some changes! We want to hear your feedback on the sub. The good, bad, the ugly, and hopefully the pretty #8230;? Basically, we want to know what you like, what you don #8217;t, and what you want. We know you all have been waiting for a real change of pace in this subreddit. So what kinds of things have you guys been wondering about? Things you want to change? Comment them down below! We #8217;ll take any ideas you have! If you really don #8217;t want to post publicly, use modmail and shoot us a message. Here #8217;s a few ideas to start us off: Rewatch Threads- Thinking of starting some rewatch discussions to keep the sub more active. Anime has ended, but there #8217;s still plenty to talk about! Weekly Discussions- Similar to rewatch threads we could have weekly topics to talk about (such as favorite characters, episodes, etc.). Low effort posts  #8211; Recently there #8217;s been a huge influx of memes. With that there #8217;s also been a pretty big divide on what people think about this. There #8217;s been lots of upvotes, but also reoccurring reports that consider this spam and low effort. So how do we define comedy? How do we not be known as  #8220;that place with bad memes #8221;  #8211; which some places already call us :/ Tell us your thoughts. Don #8217;t hold back or do if your thoughts are really mean!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone think that Yotsuba deserved the recent development that Miku got? (Chapter 85 spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-13 14:17:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Personally, I don #8217;t hate Miku, but as many non-church members are feeling, I think that Miku #8217;s confession/development with Fuutarou should #8217;ve been something she accomplished on her own. Not to say that she didn #8217;t do anything (bread/actual confessing), but I feel like Negi was leading us to believe that she was gonna grow greater confidence and independence in herself with her saying she wanted to become a person Fuutarou would love. I understand Ichika helping her, but all of sisters completely supporting her throughout the whole date just really feels like Negi is leading her up to be main girl. I #8217;m not saying this arc was bad, but would #8217;ve been a lot more satisfying if Miku really, REALLY pushed herself to do this all on her own. I feel like if Yotsuba got this sort of development with all true support miku got, it would make a lot more sense. Her sisters supporting her when she #8217;s always supported them would be such a great progression to Yotsuba #8217;s character and her unselfish nature and self guilt that she failed her sisters. Just a thought after feeling a little disappointed and confused with negi #8217;s recent choices in plot, with a ton, and ton of hanging plot threads that need to get resolved soon. Also, we seriously need a Yotsuba arc. She deserves it, as the only quint by who hasn #8217;t been manipulative or thirsty for Fuutarou, but clearly ignoring her unresolved feelings for him because of her sisters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a very brief moment, but it was incredible. Usually when I dream, they aren #8217;t very clear visually, they #8217;re like extended thought mixed in with imagination. HOWEVER, when I realized when I was dreaming today, it felt like I gained an immense control over my body and the scenery around me, which was a snowy landscape, became super clear and detailed, and I could actually see what was in my dream. I woke up right after this, but it felt amazing to actually see in my dream. It felt like I was in another world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally don #8217;t like the trope where one or more of the characters fall in love at first sight. I find there #8217;s not many manga that show natural progression into romance, and most leads end up feeling immediate attraction to one or the other. Any manga that has the leads fall in love much later?</TEXT>
