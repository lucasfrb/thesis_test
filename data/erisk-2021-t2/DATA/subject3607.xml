    <TITLE>Praecantatio Source Issues</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-31 01:38:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>For my alchemy, I'm trying to create a Praecantatio Vis Crystal and I heard that Salis Mundus was a good source for praecantatio. Though, when I input the Salis Mundus into the crucible and click it with a quartz silver, I get a Potentia Vis Crystal instead, since it also has five potentia. Is there a way to get the praecantatio instead of the potentia or is there another source I could use instead? P.S. I have this problem with a lot of crystals too, actually. I use an item that has two or more different aspects and I end up getting a primary aspect instead of the compound aspect I want. It's annoying.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Problems with converting UTAU files and importing into Audacity...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-20 06:49:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not sure if anyone else has ever experienced this, but I just finished the vocals for my newest UTAU cover and I usually convert it to a .wav, .mp4, or .ogg file to import it into Audacity so I can do further edits with the vocals and the instrumental. I usually have no problem converting them and all was well until I imported the new .wav file into Audacity. I played it, and it seemed to convert Teto's voice into a piano. I thought that was weird, so I converted it into a .ogg file to test. The same result came out... I tried a couple more converters and the second one gave me a long series of high frequency beeps sort of in the tune of the melody. I just want to know if anyone else had this problem and if they ever had a solution to it... I doubt it, though. This has never happened on any of my other songs, they converted just fine. :/</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-05 04:06:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is my very first original song I have created from scratch using my favorite Vocaloid ever, Gumi! Her English is very good and her voice is pretty (not to mention she is very pretty). I hope I can improve and create better songs. :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT2-J0kq2Ug Download vocals (vpr (vocaloid 5 format)): http://www.mediafire.com/file/v1het8nym9jo98m/Gumi_English_-_One_Drop_of_Water_%255BVocaloid_Original%255D.vpr/file Download instrumental (mp3): http://www.mediafire.com/file/sfi7kv4735zecfa/A_Raindrop%2527s_Journey.mp3/file Artwork (not mine, but belongs to monkeyyan on DeviantArt!): https://www.deviantart.com/monkeyyan/art/GUMI-363287138</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! I see that you saw my post on r/Vocaloid, and I'd appreciate if you credited me on my first ever original song, One Drop of Rain. I did work really hard on the instrumentals and vocals and I'd appreciate a tiny bit of credit at least. :) I had no idea this was posted and you didn't seem to give any credit to me!  #128517;</TEXT>

What's up with it, is the melody not interesting enough, are the instruments bland, are the lyrics cliche? Thanks! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! I like the percussion in the background! I think it would be a lot more interesting if you added a counter melody and switched things up a bit now and then, the first 30 seconds were nice, but music needs variety! It's a nice tune and would sound a lot better with some other melodies with it. Good luck! Edit: Also, in a way, I think the simple repeating melody does reflect the title of "Heavy," and it does fit well, this is just for future reference, lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, this is actually really, really good in my opinion. I really like the mystery/dread that is in the song. And WOW, that dubstep like beat about a quarter way through was really awesome! Anyway, I think the only real criticism I have is that the intro might have been just a little long, but it was still great! Nice job :0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think they sounded alright and fit in with the song, but they didn't seem to be on the same beats at different parts in the song. They sounded cool, but they didn't seem to have a set tempo and it sort of made them seem all over the place. You have potential, keep it up! Can't wait to hear more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well... while V4 is more stable, I think you should try to get V5. The voices and singing styles are beautiful and it's very, very easy to use. The attack and release options are useful and The emotion tool works wonders. Overall, I think V5 has better quality voices. The only voice I've really experimented with was Gumi English, so I'm not really sure about any other voicebanks. About the bugs, I've only had one major bug and it was that V5 would crash when I touched the pencil tool, and I found that uninstalling and reinstalling fixed everything, so honestly if you have problems like that, just uninstall and reinstall. TL;DR: I would say V5 because of the higher quality voices.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Comments on my videos are being disabled for minors appearing, even though there are literally no minors in any of my videos.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-13 08:07:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Several videos on my YouTube channel have had the comments disabled. I was told this is because YouTube has decided to take a stand against pedophiles and not allowing them to comment. I think that's great! It's just... my videos have been targeted. :( The only things I upload are Vocaloid and UTAU covers of Japanese songs I happen to like and nowhere in any of my covers are minors present. This is disappointing, because I had some great comments on some of them and it's sad to see them gone. Why were my videos targeted if they don't even fit the criteria for comments being disabled?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RGOeLMDak Here's a quick tutorial, you just have to copy the Super Mario 64 rom onto the patch.cmd file in the folder named the version of it you're using (like v1.91u) and it'll make a project 64 file for you! I'm personally having trouble, because when I start the rom, it's just a black screen... :(</TEXT>
