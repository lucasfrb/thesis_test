    <TEXT>During the end of my final semester at university, i found a job at an advertising firm. I was told by my boss that i would be in a trial period till i finish my degree and i would be paid according to the jobs i take on. He gave me a brand and asked me to create a marketing strategy for them and find out where they were lacking and what should they improve. I completed the tasks and provided my insight on the matter. The very same brand asked for a photo shoot for the season. And boss asks me how many could i do and complete in a weeks time. I said that i could easily shoot 20 dresses and deliver 3 images per dress in a weeks time. He gave me 200 dresses and asked me to deliver them in 2weeks. I worked my ass off and almost failed a course because of it. It took me three and a half weeks but i delivered work in portions every week so that they could be uploaded. He blamed it on me for being late for the clients website. I quit the very next day and found out later that my boss and his web team failed to upload images to the website on time due to lack of web development. He simply didn't want to pay me. I still see the brand using my strategic guidelines</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone feels pain from different things, and the intensity of this pain varies from person to person. Having said that, from my personal experience, which was a pretty bad down hill ride. I kept hitting a new low point every time I thought "it couldn't get any lower than this". I became more anti social, kept to myself and let go of the things that mattered to me. I had help and that was my mother who said something that sparked something in me. I looked into my skill set which the education system never helped me identify and found my calling. Will doing this make me happy? I asked myself andYes! was the answer. So I worked my ass off, ignoring pain and loneliness with all that I had, still happiness seemed far off. I failed at it for two whole years but I didn't give up. It was something honest and failure didn't matter. At last after a few yearsI had a sense of achievement, and the most important thing was that it was all for my sake and not for someone whom I onced loved or the peers who's opinion used to matter for everyone. It was for my my little vict #305;ry that  #305; cou #351;d cheriah in my loneliness. I worked and eventually things got bettet. I guess breakings is a lot quicker anf the repair yaked time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Windows 10 malfunctioning after update.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-16 19:29:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this happened a couple of days ago, when windows found a corrupt file in the Nvidia driver folder. I scanned the computer for errors and it showed that there was an error in the graphics driver folder. Uninstalled the driver and reinstalled a fresh one from the website. Then the pc crashed and I got the "your pc ran into a problem" . It rebooted and started up quite slowly. Installed hd tunes checked disk for errors (it took 5 hours), report said that the hard diak had no bad sectors, and was perfectly healthy. Ran the cmd scannow which stopped at 56% saying that there was an error in the files and could not continue. Disk defrag is on auto settings but i still ran it. Nothing changed. Uninstalled a lot of things, split the partition. Ran repairs for registry. But still nothing. Window showed another attention box that a corrupt file in adobe folder was fixed. Today my pc crashed again during work just as I was about to send a very important email. I had done windows repair but nothing had changed apparently. So I now decided to reset my windows. After the restting was at 1%, another blue screen appears saying that windows could not be reset. Now its simply a loop of "none of these options work" and I am looking at a total format. Good job windows update, obi wan shouts :"YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I checked hard disk for errors and bad sectors but it showed that nothing was wrong. Rather it reported that the hard disk was prefectly healthy. Files on the volume were corrupted. But even after a few uninstalls and reinstalls, other files showed errors or corruption. Sounded like a virus but it wasnt. But anyway I am doing a clean install now. Almost finishing a bootable drive setup currently. Thank you for replying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My last semester of bachelor's degree and I landed a job at a small advertising agency. I was hired as a graphics designer, social media specialist and photographer. The catch was that my first month would be a trial. Now I know that having three positions is a handful but I had done the very same job a couple of years ago in my home country. The owner came to me and asked me how many dresses I could shoot and deliver within a weeks time. I told him that if it is product photography for web, simply 3 pictures per dress and edited for color corrections would easily make 50 dresses per week. So he says fine but then asks, can you do 200 dresses in a week. I said we would need to plan this and I would require assistance and three models, so I could stream line the shoot and get it done in two weeks. He said alright. Now the company already had a photographer but the owner didn't like him so he wanted to get rid of him. I have shot 500 products per day before and I had done such loads on a regular basis. The reason was that I was going to do the editing as well, so I asked for 2 weeks. The owner found a studio and the three models for the size fit. I asked him about the equipment and he said "we will pick it up before the shoot begins." I told him that I need to check the camera and the accessories at least a couple of days before the shoot to see if there is any problem. He said its fine its a new camera, I paid a lot of money for it. I still insisted but he said that he had to go and the photographer was busy elsewhere. Now aside from all of this, my university finals were near, final year project was in its crucial stages and to top it off, differential equations was one of the courses. I am not good at maths and Diff is still a nightmare. The day of the shoot arrives and for some reason the camera does not tether with the laptop. Now I know some people dont tether their camera but it is a good practice to see details , check for dust and light. But unfortunately it wasn't working and I was on the clock. To add to that, one of the model came 4 hours late. But I planned everything with a flow, so the shoot goes smoothly and the two models were really pacing themselves while changing outfits. The studio was big, had a clean back drop, lots of powerful lights. Things went smoothly and we ended the shoot. 200 dresses and 800+shots. Everyone was tired and the studio was rented, so we packed up and left around 6pm. I was pretty tired but I had to check the pictures on a big screen. And bam! two big smuged dots on the sides of almost every picture. This ment that I could not automate and would have to manually remove them from the final 600 selected shots. I quickly called my boss and informed him about this and told him that there would be a bit of a delay. But he simply refused to accept it or talk to the client and tell them that half of the shoot could be delivered in two weeks time. I insisted that we need to give quality work output therefore, there would be a delay. He said that I had lied to him. With that I began my editing marathon. I had almost three hours of sleep per day for the coming three weeks. The delivery was delayed by a week still, cause I am a human and unfortunately not a miracle worker. When I sent the last picture, I also sent an email of resignation. A month and a half after quitting, I learnt a few things by a friend I had made in the office. 1. The contract with the cleint had ended since the deadline was exceeded by a month. Becuase the person was an assistant in the company was also a (lets say wannabe) web designer and was supposed to upload the pictures but could not connect the database to the website. Lol 2. The brand new camera was sabotaged because there were no other lenses for it and that the shoot that happened using the camera the day before did not have any problems. 3. I was let go since I wasn't going to get paid my due and was eventually expected to quit. Therefore, "get work done out of him for free in the trial month" was the point of it all. I had learnt a couple of important lessons from that experience and luckily graduated even after scoring a D in differentials.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem here is that people love to mix a misguided sense of culture with religion. Here, what Islam says about prayer is completely opposite to what these self proclaimed pious believers did to the train staff who are just doing thier job. Prayer can be performed at a clean place without distractions, thats it. No shrine has been deemed to bring a person any closer to God anymore than praying at one's local mosque.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two of the wonders of the world. A handful of nobel laureates again for chemistry and o and poetry persian and urdu poetry is still s prime example of literature and music as well. But honestly speaking, I am not a fan of the current state of religions all over the world. And specifically Islamic countries that use it(religion) as a tool to forward their own ambitions and agendas to remain in power. Your argument would be better made like this "religion is an ideology, it cannot be considered scientific due various factors( one being rigidity) and in todays modern world, science is the way towards prosperity, therefore in a social setting such as this, there is bound to be cases of mob mentality". Remember if you try to single out one member of a set, chances are that the other members are also sharing the same attributes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I have this Chinese made manual focus at 400-800mm fixed at f8. It has a Canon mounting ring. Holding that lens and shooting while adjusting the focus was a nightmare at first but I adjusted my shooting method and now it's all good. The lens has chromatic abberation but such a range at such a cheap price was a catch. I think a photographer is only as good as his skills by the end of the day and a handicap is always a teacher. I feel that I am much better at shooting birds now because of such a lens.</TEXT>
