    <TEXT>Right now I #8217;m going hybrid with him until I can get a scarlet ring and the scarlet sword I think it #8217;s called with ore right? Well anyways just regular physical damage dealer build but with his special stuff combined with some extra defense to give him even more strength. He is about to be level 80  amp; I already got him at 57 SC, I just started playing this year so I don #8217;t know any optimal builds so you #8217;ll have to ask an old head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason I want the scarlet ring is so when my BB Shin uses his special it will crit for 9999+2000 dps with my Rebel Dragoon #8217;s ark  #128578;  amp; the sword of course to enhance his physical dps overall, I know very little about the game but I think a critical strike on a special is the most satisfying thing even if it #8217;s not the strongest someone should tell me what #8217;s better for my unit.</TEXT>
