    <TITLE>AITA for not wanting to get a dog with my sister?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-08 20:23:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been conflicted about this for a while so I figured I'd go ahead and ask and get it given to me straight. I had mentioned wanting a dog before, so my mom told me she'd decided it was a good time to get one and it could be my birthday present (coming up early August). My sister heard about this and told my mom she also wanted a dog, so mom decided to have us pick one out together. My issue comes with my sister's past behavior with dogs. Maybe 6 months ago? My sister got a dog, but she was barely able to care for it and often shoved responsibilities off on the rest of the family. My parents gave her the ultimatum of stepping her game up and getting a handle on things, or giving the dog to a family friend- she chose to give him up. Quite frankly I don't want to share a dog with her, have to agree on a name, a breed, etc if she won't even be taking care of the dog. And while I know she could have changed, she's also working full-time right now. (To be fair I'm also working full-time, but I do so from home as a contracted freelancer. We both still live with mom because economy and all that lol). Also, I don't know if it makes sense, but I'd rather not argue over her needing to take her fair share of cleaning up after the pup when she's home and inevitably end up doing it myself, I'd like to just have it all on my plate and not have to try and collaborate on it. I feel very conflicted about it though- my mom insists I'm being petty, although she has admitted that the only reason she's insisting that I pick one out with my sister is because she doesn't want her to hold a grudge against her. My sister of course also insists I'm petty, although my brother is on my side. Am I being unreasonable/an asshole about this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>WIBTA if I told my dad I want nothing to do with him?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-11 06:19:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>(sorry if the format is wack, I'm on mobile) I'll just give a quick, condensed timeline of my dad's fathering, if you will. Ages 1-8 he was pretty much absent or partying, 8-15 he was a hard alcoholic, 16- present (I'm now 19) he's working on a drug addiction. Not to say there weren't some good times sprinkled in, but they were few and far between and we've rarely been on good terms. Around when I was 17 he was diagnosed with MS, so he basically can't walk anymore as well. We were all understanding of that of course, we dismissed instances where he'd blow up on us as misdirected stress, we assumed him not taking initiative to get better would pass in time, but it hasn't. He continuously has what we call episodes, where basically some unlucky individual will be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It could be me not saying good morning when I see him, and he'd scream at me and cus me out. Long story short, I'm done and so is the family. He's temporarily staying in california with his sisters. At the moment, basically everyone is sick of his behavior (the freak outs, lying about drugs, refusing to go to rehab- both physical and for addiction- and saying he doesn't have a problem, etc) and they want to have a group intervention where everyone says what they feel. My mom talked to me before hand about my feelings, which are that I don't want anything to do with him and at this point I'd prefer if he stayed out of my life for good, and she wants me to tell him this. However, I feel like it's incredibly harsh. To be frank, he's a disabled man who's struggling with addiction, and who's entire family is fed up with him and his wife of 18 years is in the process of divorcing him. I feel like throwing a "and you kids don't want you as their father anymore" in there is... A lot. However, my mom insists that I do it and in the end it's for the greater good. Would I be an asshole if I did? I can't help but feel like a white lie is better, but I also don't want to enable any of this any further. Edit: I should clarify I'm ready to say it, if that's what needs to be said to push him to get better, then that's that. But if it's a dick move then I don't want to do it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Starting seeds indoors?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 14:18:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live in Texas and right now it's just too hot to direct sow, anything I've tried just seems to grow a few inches and then stop/starts to dry up. I think I could maybe get away with it if I watered twice a day, but even I can't handle that much heat lol. I've started trying to grow seedlings indoors, but literally everything I've tried gets leggy and then falls over and dies (I placed them in front of the window that gets the most sunlight), or even after a slow introduction to outside, burns and dies once it gets a full day of the sun. Do yall have any tips for starting seeds indoors and getting better results?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[help] Is doggy daycare necessary?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-19 09:57:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been working from home for a long time (since well before covid related things) so I've been handling things with my dog by myself. However, in a bit of a surprise notice, I might have to return to an office setting. I'm not sure I can afford doggy daycare or a walker (at least not the whole week, half could maybe be possible) and it worries me. My girl is already left alone for 4-5 hours a day to simulate me "leaving" to avoid attachment issues, but I'm not sure if I could just double it. She's a belgian malinois/anatolian shepherd mix, so naturally very active, however she's also a hell of a lot lazier than any mal or anatolian I've ever met, and prefers to sit around by me most of the day even when I try to engage her to play/train/etc. (Almost makes me think there's more mixed into her than the shelter said?) So long story short, my question is basically is it always necessary to have something like doggy daycare for your pooch? If not, how do you decide if it's needed?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pain in side and headaches?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-19 16:40:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 19F, 5'7", 330lbs, and mixed african american/korean. Recently (I'd say for the last 3 weeks) I've had a constant, never ending headache. I can usually ignore it for part of the day but not for long, and it makes it nearly impossible for me to do work. I've struggled with migraines for the past year, and both rizatriptan and diclofenac sodium were ineffective or only worked a fourth of the time. Over the counter meds like advil, tylenol, and aleve tone it down a bit but don't make it go away. I've also had this pain in my left side, maybe 4-5 inches up from my navel, that comes and goes, but happens at least two times a day. With it all combined I've just felt absolutely horrible and have no motivation to do anything. I understand a lot of it could be related to my weight, but a lot of my weight loss efforts make my head hurt even worse, even if it's just something basic like cutting soda out. Not exactly looking to shell out for a doc appt only to be told I need to lose weight (I'm well aware that I need to and I'm trying, I've already lost some, but doctors usually just tell me this and provide no other help). Should I go to an appointment and insist for other things, or do I just need to keep powering through weight loss?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-19 23:51:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I admittedly have a bit of a guilt complex, and it makes me feel pretty bad about my dog. I know she doesn't need to be engaged constantly like a human child, but I feel bad anyways when she's in her kennel, or just sitting around with me while I do work/watch shows. I play with her frequently, train her, and take her for two walks a day but I still feel like she's bored and sad when she shows no signs of it. I can't imagine I'm alone in this though- those of you who have experienced this/something similar, how do you get over it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to in person therapy once a while ago, and for a couple weeks after the fact I actually felt content and fairly happy. I haven't been since though, the anxiety leading up to appointments was too much for me. With current events and such my mental health has managed to get even worse, and I could probably stand for some help right about now. I don't think I could handle in person again though (not that it's even an option right now with covid) and I was wondering for those of you that have tried it, does online text/phone therapy work as well for you as in person?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I bring my dog back to the shelter?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-20 01:26:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>A couple days ago I took home a dog from the shelter, she's a sweet 1.5 year old shepherd mix. I had been planning this for months before hand, grabbing the right supplies, figuring out what size dog to get, figuring out vet costs, vaccines and such. When I was ready I finally went to look for a dog and found her, then took her home. She's been great, she gets me outside, provides me company, and is a general all around loved presence in the house. I know it's only been a few days, but I love her to death as well. The bad side is that she is absolutely horrible for my anxiety. I really didn't expect it, but she's cranked my brain up to 10. At night all I can think about is how she'd be so much happier somewhere else, how sad I'll be when she passes, or what if she gets seriously injured and I can't afford a huge vet bill, what if something happens in my life where I can't afford her basic needs anymore. That anxiety has in turn made my depression worse, and brought a lot of my issues to the surface. I just feel like I can't handle it anymore, it's this horrible weight that follows me through the day and makes me sick to my stomach. I've started wondering if it would be better for the both of us if I took her back to be adopted by someone else. Should I try to power through this? Should I actually bring her back? I'm just unsure what to do right now, all I know is that I don't want to spend another night sleep deprived and crying because I'm too worried about my dog.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-22 22:59:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I got my dog from the shelter they did a cat test and she gave the cat a sniff before ignoring them completely, and has pretty much shown the same behavior at home. However, if the cats approach her while she's eating she growls and sometimes snaps at them. She isn't food aggressive with me at all though, and we've made good progress with her holding a stay/working before eating despite being extremely food driven. She also every now and then will lock eyes with the cats and lunge at them, every time I catch her I break her focus but the behavior seems to be persisting. Lastly, she seems to dislike one of my cats in particular and will every now and then follow him around and growl at him. I reprimand her every time I catch her doing these things, but it happens so rarely that I feel like what I'm doing isn't sticking. Should I just keep doing what I'm doing and be patient, or is there something else I could be doing?</TEXT>

We thought she was cat friendly but things went south once she settled in, lots of aggression towards them so we unfortunately had to take her back. I think part of the reason that I feel so guilty is because she was stressing me out a bit beforehand with worry about her and responsibilities, I persevered of course was 100% going to keep her, but once she showed cat aggression I can't help but feel like I was all too ready to get rid of her. I'm sure she'll be adopted soon by a nice, loving and cat free family, but still, my brain won't quit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for demanding my dad's dog be taken back?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-26 09:01:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bit of a long one, sorry. My mom and dad legally separated and while things cool down he decided to stay with family out of state. He took the family dog with him who I'll call Chip, because he doubles as his service dog (has on and off physical disability). While out there, my aunt frequently complained about him mistreating Chip, things like locking him in a room and forgetting to let him out, forgetting to feed him, not walking him (VERY active breed). Chip naturally started to act up, and my dad began saying things along the lines of "I'm gonna get that dog" or "he won't do that again when I'm done with him." He got fed up with his family for various reasons and decided to stay with a friend in a different state- said friend (I'll call them John) is the breeder who gave us Chip, and runs a dog training place. On the property he has small houses for week long training seminars, one of which my dad is staying in. He loses Chip on the first day, and he is found by a neighbor. Loses Chip again on the second day, for whatever reason he lies and says he called John when he didn't. Mom calls John because she's worried about Chip of course, John gets upset that he was never called and goes to look for him. Turns out Chip was hiding in the backyard, and had been doing so for over 10 hours. The odd thing about this is that Chip HATES the outdoors. He's an inside dog and a Velcro one at that, always wants to be petted up and cuddled up to his family. The fact that he was hiding outside for this long in the summer heat with no food/water, not responding to my dad calling for him, makes me think he's scared of my dad. (Side note, dad has bad vision so he couldn't see him). This was the last straw for me and I said what was on my mind, I told my mom he needs to be shipped back immediately, even offered to cover the costs. The issue my mom has with this is that she would have to do this through John, and explain why. John is one of my dad's only friends and frequently gives him dog training classes for free (dad is a dog trainer when he's feeling up to it), and if he knew my dad was possibly abusing Chip he wouldn't tolerate it. And while Chip doesn't do much for him physically, my dad uses him for emotional support. I have continued to insist he be brought home regardless, there are just too many signs that something's wrong- Chip's odd behavior, my dads threatening comments, and his personality in general. My dad has always had a temper and been quick to anger, there's a lot I wouldn't put past him. Mom is upset with me for my "lack of compassion". She loves Chip as well but wants me to wait until dad is back with family and Chip can be brought back without bringing John into this, but that could take weeks. She also suspects my dad could be physically abusing Chip but because there's no concrete evidence she doesn't want to bring it up. AITA for pushing that he be brought back?</TEXT>

It's kind of like green and black thumbs in gardening, you can have all the steps laid out: sow seeds an inch deep, water daily for two months, prune like so, and you'll have some herbs or carrots or whatever, but there are a lot of different things that go into it, little intricacies and such. Some just need a whole lot more practice than others to understand the steps correctly and get the right feel of things, although a lot of people tend to give up before then as well.</TEXT>

Get tags, attach them, and write his phone number on all of them. Throw them in various places, some obvious, some that'll take a while to find.

Then below it, you write how you could fix things in the nightmare. Let's say you get attacked by a shark and can't swim back to shore- you'd write down something like "this time I have a harpoon and a life vest, so I kill/injure the shark, scare it away, and then safely float back to shore." Many people say this helps them, and the suggestions they write down end up turning their dreams for the better after a bit of time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me preface this by saying I don't think *all* guns should be taken away, but most of them/stricter buying and manufacturing regulations need to be put in place as well. 1. Let's talk about the big one, school shootings. The US ranks number 1 in a lot of things, including this. From 2009-2018 we had 288 of them. Runner up was Canada, with a whopping two school shootings. Why do other countries have less school shootings? Very strict gun control/a ban on guns entirely. As for the "what about illegal guns?" Argument, around 80% of school shootings in the last 40 years were done with legally purchased firearms, whether that be by the shooter themselves or family members who failed to lock their guns up. 2. "It's an infringement on rights", okay, maybe it would be now, but the whole point of amendments is that they can be amended/new ones can be created, as they should be with different generations. i.e slavery, voting rights, taxes, presidential terms, etc. 3. Accidental gun deaths. A lot of these are done by children messing around because their parents failed to show gun safety in their own house. Now you could bring up things like car accidents, house fires, etc, but those are two separate issues. I'm only talking about this one that can be easily prevented. It's a strawman argument at best. 4. "Criminals are gonna criminal". Unfortunately there hasn't been much reliable research conducted in recent years, mostly because private organizations can't afford to and government agencies have been banned from doing so with government funds/send out unreliable data, but the last time serious research was conducted it was in prisons. Roughly 50-60% of offenders said they got their guns legally/from family members legally, so if there was stricter gun control it would cut down significantly on gun violence. Can we stop it all? No, but what people have to understand is that things aren't going to be instant. It takes time to move guns out of the general population, you can't just say "well what about illegal guns?", Yes they're going to be out there at first, but where do you think they come from? They move from legal sources to illegal ones, so if you cut off the source and continue taking illegal ones off the streets... I think you can do the math on that. 5. "What about protection?" If the protests these last months have shown anything, it's that there are plenty of non-lethal weapons to go around that the police have access to. Rubber bullets, long distance tasers, pepper spray, etc. And while these do have a lot of danger to go with, just like guns, the lethality is far, far less. 6. Suicides. Roughly 66% of gun deaths are from suicide alone. Will people find other ways to kill themselves without access to guns? Sure, but at least this gives them a higher chance of being stopped, spotted, or prevented. 7. Last one for now, "guns don't kill people, people do." Well they use guns to do it, so... Not much to say for this one. The US currently has a mental health and classism epidemic, both of which contribute to gun violence. Those two things are much harder to work on/stop, so until they can be addressed in a significant way, why not take away the guns? Unless you're a through and through proponent of better mental health care, better outreach/access to things in poorer areas who's actually pushing for it, then its extremely hypocrital to be against gun control in this manner.</TEXT>

It's not a bad sensation when you're prepared right, some find it to be worse, some find it to be great, depends on the person. It's kind of like nipples lol, some people have a great time when they're stimulated, others feel like you're just touching skin as you would any other part of the body. Can be fun to experiment in the bedroom though, so I always say give things a shot and if you don't like it, then you don't have to do it anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've been on the search for a new dog and I'm trying to help some of my mom's fears. I found a good dog for us, a 4 month old pitbull who has been raised around cats (we have 3), and they're from a small rescue (she also thinks the adoption fee of $200 is expensive, I'm paying, but I thought that was fairly normal for small rescues, what's y'all's experience?). Mom thinks that because we don't know the dogs parents, it could be in their lineage that, while good with cats now, they'd become aggressive as adults. I just don't think that's possible since they'd be raised together and our cats love to hang around dogs, but hey, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, just wanted to ask. She seems to think this is a breed specific issue for pitbulls.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-28 19:00:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? * No, we've owned only big dogs, a beauceron, boerboel, pitbulls, and cane corsos. We've trained all of our previous dogs ourselves, and are friends with a lot of good trainers. 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? * No preference, although we aren't really looking to drop $1000+ on a dog. 3) Describe your ideal dog. * A dog who's good with cats, has few health issues, would be good with playtime and two or three walks a day, possibly good with jogging as well. Happy to be around people but not ALWAYS looking for our attention, and not super high energy but not super lazy as well. Preferably medium-big (around nothing less than 20lbs). 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? * Don't have any particular preference. 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? * It would be fun to do interesting tricks, but if they can at least do the basic sit, down, stay, and heel then we're happy. 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? * No, they'd just be a family dog. If they'd make a good watch dog then that's a bonus. **Care Commitments** 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? * Can personally interact with them outside of work hours, so basically anything outside 9-5 with maybe and hour or two for commute, but there will be people who can play with them occasionally while I'm out. 8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? * Two walks a day, maybe a mile or two long each, and can be run/jogged with maybe two times a week if necessary. Dog park once a week on weekends. 9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? * Would be fine with general brushing/cleaning ears, would pay for hair/nail trims and such. **Personal Preferences** 10) What size dog are you looking for? * Any size above 20lbs preferably. 11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? * Can handle shedding, a bit of slobber, but would not be fond of barking (At least outside the house- neighbors wouldn't be happy, but if they're just a bit vocal inside the house that's okay) 12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? * Not too important, but would like a dog that's responsive when I call for them of course **Dog Personality and Behavior** 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? * Somewhere in the middle maybe, don't want a super cuddly dog but anything else would be okay 14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that #8217;s more eager-to-please? * Either is fine 15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? * Barking to let us know someone's there is okay, but don't need a dog that's going to attack/bite strangers or visitors 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? * No, we'd like the possibility of getting another dog in the future/going to the dog park. 17) Are there any other behaviors you can #8217;t deal with or want to avoid? * Don't want aggression towards cats, we have 3, all of which like to hang around/approach dogs when we have them. **Lifestyle** 18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? * Roughly 8 hours a day. 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? * Same preferences as me, would be happy to cuddle/play with the dog. 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? * 3 cats, and fish and lizards but I'm not sure they count. Somewhat interested in getting another dog in the future. 21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? * Not really, all children in the house are 16+ but there are a lot of young children in the neighborhood. 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? * No. 23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? * Houston, Texas. Don't believe there are any restrictions, at least that I'm aware of. 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? * Summers are consistently 100f+ (mornings and evenings when walks would take place are 80-90f though), winter's are somewhat mild with maybe 3-5 days that actually go below 32f. **Additional Information and Questions** 25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. * Besides some of the things we can't change (cats, hours gone during the day, etc) we have a little wiggle room so its not all firm. If it's a change we can feasibly make, we'll do it. 26) Feel free to ask any questions below. The reason I've stipulated nothing under 20lbs is because we're worried about the bathroom situation. I've heard smaller dogs need to go to the bathroom frequently, more than we might be able to accommodate. Is this true? If it isn't then we'd be interested in smaller dogs as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had chronic stomach issues since before I remember, and I've come to the possible conclusion that I might just have IBS. However, one stomach issue seems to stand out a bit. I had this pain in my left side (Dull, but still concentrated? a little bit sharp? idk how to describe it) about 2-4 inches below my nip, kind of in the center (not closer to the back or front). I had this up until a week ago, but now I feel the exact same sensation maybe 6 inches to the left of my navel, and also 4 inches to the right of it as well, and the one near my nip is gone. Any ideas as to what this could mean? I intend to go to the doctor, but I currently have an incompetent family doctor and finding one during a pandemic has proven to be a bit hard. Really just want to know if I should be speeding things up/especially concerned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are barriers to voting in America, while employees legally have to let you leave to vote, a lot will heavily imply they won't let you without consequences, and some need the money so bad they cant afford to. Some places have extremely poor transportation, so people can't even get to the polling stations which are miles upon miles away. And in a lot of poorer, overcrowded places they'll have ridiculously few polling stations which means lines are so long people end up leaving or are illegally forced to do so. However, you also have to take into account that a lot of people don't believe their vote counts, and it's in a lot of cases 100% true. If you don't live in a swing state then your vote literally doesn't mean jack shit, besides maybe at the end of the day showing someone had the 'popular vote'. I personally believe you should vote out of civic duty, and because there are many other things on polls that do rely on a non-delegate vote, but not many see it that way/are educated enough in school to realize this.</TEXT>

Its mostly good stuff, I'm talking boxed up ikea type furniture, outdated but working electronics, lots of baby stuff for some reason, and just various odds and ends you'd find in a mixed lot of amazon stuff. Is there any type of service you can find around the US (specifically texas if you happen to know any) that'll take this stuff and distribute it to people who need it?

I have never had nor been fed any illusions of being able to go to higher education like college as I can't afford to, therefore as long as I passed with the bare minimum I was okay. Although I will say my parents were mildly disappointed when I got less than a B, not much was said about it. If you could afford to go, there's definitely a more apparent effort by kids and parents alike as far as studying and keeping A's, but even that isn't necessary here unless unless the college you want to go to has a big name. Community colleges will take you as long as you have a highschool diploma, and after that a degree is a degree, so unless you went to an ivy league school most don't care about the name.</TEXT>

I've done tile before, but food/poop would slip between the cracks and I didn't want to grout/caulk it because her enclosure is currently easily collapsible and I'd prefer to keep it that way. Are there any other solid substrate options that are going to look better than napkins?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got this thing stuck in my head and I can't remember if it's from a movie, tv show, or even possibly video game. I remember a group coming to this neighborhood where (possibly in the middle of a barbecue) everyone disappeared years ago, and as they walked through the neighborhood they found a single woman and her child left (I think the child was actually a ghost?). They were both weird but the child was evil-ish I believe, part of the group stayed upstairs with the mom and others went into a basement of sorts to 'play' with the kid or something, and the kid tries to kill them by flooding it I think. It ends okay and they end up leaving with info maybe? I have no idea where this is from lol but it's stuck in my head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup. This is kind of an obscure example, but there are quite a few people who basically acted strangely through childhood, so they wondered if they had been through some kind of abuse and repressed it. They would then use self hypnosis to try and bring forth the memories, and would accidentally make themselves believe/create memories that they had been abused despite it not happening. (Not to say all of them were wrong, but many after self reflection figured out they had essentially made it up and because of circumstancial evidence ended up truly believing it).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue is that fat people *are* oppressed. I would never compare it to racism, LGBT issues, etc (nor have I ever seen someone do that) because at the end of they day they are all completely different things, but that doesn't change that fact that fat people are often treated unfairly and bullied for their appearance VERY frequently. A lot of chubby people are perfectly healthy as well. The reason they want representation in media is because it's almost non-existent except for a fat joke here and there. It doesn't push unhealthy ideals, but instead allows people deemed fat that they can be confident in their bodies, and body shaming does not push fat people to be healthier, but instead pushes things like unhealthy diets and poor mental health.</TEXT>

What on earth does it do to you to see fat people as models? Does it put a thought in your brain of "I want to eat high carb foods now"? Does it hurt your feelings? Have you ever seen it upset children? If having it there doesn't affect the rest of the general population but can do positive things for fat people, why complain about it? If you actually care so much about the obesity epidemic then you should be instead trying to push the education system/parents to teach more about good nutrition, and making healthy eating cheaper- not worrying about fat people in billboards.</TEXT>

A lot of them still have pretty bad gender issues, racism, homophobia, classism, etc, so if any of those apply to you check out people's travel experiences, there's plenty out there. Take heed of the different laws, living prices, and how your experience might differ from the big city life you might see showcased online and dig a bit deeper. Then you'll probably want to visit yourself before moving- make sure it's a good fit. Once that's all said and done, you can move on to immigration.

My mom occasionally has the "you should talk to your dad" convo with me but otherwise we can hang out outside of their house just fine, and calls/emails can't really be butted into of course. Hang out with my sis all the time as we mutually think pops is an asshole, can't really speak to relatives though as I was never close with them- although we do occasionally comment on each other's Facebook posts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, lots of backwoods people breeding white tigers, but also a surprisingly large amount of prominent zoos. The big issue with them is that they almost entirely come from inbreeding. They're naturally occurring but only very rarely, but you can basically short cut it and get better chances through incest. Hence the loads of them with cross eyes, underbites, feet deformities, etc. I'm not sure a white tiger has been produced naturally in captivity in a long time.</TEXT>

Not sure if it helps, but all of the art seems to be little boys playing with various animals. Think it's slightly visible in the pic, but the middle piece also has a little rectangle coming off the top back with two small holes, and the same piece behind the head of the spout. Biggest bottom piece has 5 very small holes in the top, and smallest top piece has no holes at all.</TEXT>

And part of the no-bite training you can actually do yourself. Your dog isn't actually 'agressive', they're just scared- you have to build their confidence, both in themselves and in you (kenneling really does help with this if you haven't done it already, it creates a safe space for them should they get upset while training, that way if you notice signs of fear you can just lead them back and begin training later.)

    <TITLE>Tooth cracking/peeling on bottom, possibly shifting?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-13 23:15:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm having an issue with one of my bottom molars. It feels like a crown that doesn't fit quite right, where there's a gap between it and the gum line (this tooth has never had a crown on it to be clear). I also think part of the filling cracked off. This last one I'm not sure on, but it seems to be shifting outwards as well. Don't feel any pain with this. What might this mean/what could I be looking at when I can finally save up enough to go to the dentist? Should I be more hasty to get an appointment? If it's relevant, I had a dentist tell me I'd have issues with my wisdom teeth and I'd need to get them removed, but they also kind of fucked me over so I took everything they said with a grain of salt, since the next dentist after that never brought it up. I've linked some pics if they help. http://imgur.com/a/dYnc0ui</TEXT>

And if you do end up with some extras way down the line, you can always sell em for a pretty penny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know there's more than this, but two I know of are papaya and PTC. Because of certain enzymes, some people think papaya smells like vomit/funk/dirty socks (like me lol) and others just think it smells nice and fruity. Lots of brassica plants (brussel sprouts, broccoli, kale), coffee, some teas, grapefruit, and plenty other things contain something called PTC. People have varying reactions to it, like not being able to taste it at all to flinching at how bitter it is (an extreme reaction means you're a supertaster, also like me! I'm a dirty, no good picky eater lmao).</TEXT>

If it needs to go down because of some kind of damage, like fire or just really old age, they usually bring in a high reach mechanical excavator. My favorite method is one that was created in Japan. They basically put the building on computer controlled hydraulic jacks, then proceed to knock out the first floor entirely, and lower it to the ground. Knock out the next floor, lower it again, etc etc. However, the largest building to ever be demolished so far was only 47 stories.

    <TEXT>Mine are nonviolent, so theres no worries there at least. When my mom was having trouble with my dad as she was pregnant with my older sister, she decided to stay with my dad's mom as they were close. Went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, looked down the hall and saw a smiling man. He was wearing a distinctive sweater, and told her everything was going to be alright. She told this to my grandmother, who went and grabbed a picture of my grandfather, wearing the exact sweater my mom saw- almost no way she could've seen it beforehand. I had a very similar encounter, was just stressing over things. Woke up in the middle of the night and saw a woman in, once again, a distinctive clothing item lol, told me she loved me and some other kind words. Told my mom about it and she said the blouse was one her mom's favorites. Creeped me the hell out but I appreciate the ghostly sentiments. Last one wasn't so much a sighting, but just creepy. In our house we have a hallway that overlooks the living room- almost every last dog we've ever had will bark up at the hallway, and the cats will stare up there. We're so used to it now that we just ignore it, but damn if it didn't spook us when we first moved in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure some could do it on purpose, but I also know a LOT of parents are just neglectful enough to let this happen. They either forget the kid is in the car because they're being silent, or kids decide to play drive and get themselves locked in when left unwatched. My own dad (who was admittedly a pretty bad parent lol) meant to take me to school, but he was so out of it he stuck me in the car in my PJs and then left me in the car while he was at work. Ran out an hour later when he remembered, but it really is just an all too common occurrence that can easily have a fatal outcome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There'd definitely be a significant effect. The adult bugs are very important to the food chain, but I'd say their larvae even more so for many aquatic species. However, while their numbers might initially decline, everything would most likely bounce back, and the different species mosquitoes used to outcompete would fill in the gaps. For species that rely on mosquitoes and are already on the verge of extinction, it would most likely be the final blow to their populations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you first start to lose weight, a small part of it is water weight which disappears very quickly. After that you start burning actual fat, which takes longer. And then as you lose weight, your metabolism goes down, which means you lose it slower. If you want to speed things up, it's actually best not to lower your calorie count again, but instead exercise more. Slow weight loss is actually a good thing for the body too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. People are usually 13-15 when they start high school. 2. No, many live in separate apartments or stay home, but campus housing can be cheaper. A lot of fancy/ivy league colleges require freshman spend their first year on campus as well. 3. The basic template for high school classes is English, math, science, and history. Any classes after that are special electives based on interests, like dance, orchestra, band, theater, and even things like welding at some schools. 4. There are always some prerequisite courses kind of like highschool, but other than that it depends entirely on major. 5. Detention is for everything k-12, except maybe the youngest of students. Usually for elementary though, detention is rare. Instead you get something like sitting out recess, or solitary lunch. After detention, the next level up is temporary and permanent expulsion. If you have any other questions let me know, I'd be happy to answer!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- depends on the school. For the most part, foreign language only becomes mandatory in high school, and it's usually two credits, i.e two consecutive years of the same language. Many colleges require you have two language credits from high school as well. - it's a bit convoluted for that one. Individual classes are usually kept to 20-30 students, so its basically however many groups/teachers are needed to keep those numbers for that in elementary school (basically changes by school population). Also, for these grade levels, each student usually only has one or two teachers for the entire day. Once you get to middle and high school, it goes up to seven different classes a day for each student, all taught by different teachers. They aren't kept independent, so you could have two entirely different sets of classmates for English and algebra, although you'll usually find peers you share a lot of classes with because of similar grade level standard classes. Classes between junior and senior year are usually a pretty mixed bunch, so you'll find 11th graders mixed with 12th, sometimes 10th graders as well. Schools usually keep freshman/9th graders to their own classes, but the odd one will show up in higher level classes. Hope that makes sense! Know it can be a bit confusing lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our cat had some stress issues when we introduced a new dog, and he took to using laundry baskets as litter boxes lol. Was an absolute nightmare, lifting up the collar of your shirt and realizing it smelled like piss. We took him to the vet and got him kitty anxiety meds, as well as added a couple more litter boxes. This seemed to help him avoid accidents/calmed him a bit until he could adjust accordingly. A puppy is going to be a lot easier than the full grown dog we got though, depending on how chill your cat is they might not care at all. If they don't seem okay, just switch back to a nice and slow introduction. You want the cat to be okay with the dog, but you also don't want to start a pattern of cat agression with said pup either. As far as moving goes, I'm sure they'll be fine, they'll have you with them after all! It'll probably help if you temporarily keep them locked in your room, and once they're used to it let them out into the rest of the house. Best of luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>its been a year of pests and dying trees for me unfortunately. -first up is my dwarf plum. its covered in these red bumps, i dont check on it too often so from a distance I thought leaves were just dying off per the norm, but up close it looks like some sort of teeny bug. The tree looks normal at the top but is bare at the bottom, looks like its losing leavez from the bottom up. Any idea what it is? -lime has asian citrus psyllids, but people told me to leave them be as key limes were resistant. The tree has just been losing leaf after leaf though, and now its almost bare. is this the psyllids or something else? -last pic is my lemon- it seems to be yellowing just like the lime did before it started seriously losing leaves</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for all the info! I'm located in Houston, Texas, soil is mostly clay, and I water roughly every 2-3 days. The trees actually aren't staked (except the peach in the very background lol) I've just forgotten to take the ties off. They were planted last summer, just, yeah, still haven't taken off ties and tags :,) . I was careful about planting to deep, the mulch is only touching the stem at the moment because the lawn guys cut today and the weedwackers blow all the mulch up against the trunk, had yet to push things back. Although I do need to pull some weeds from it as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not something that can be done unfortunately, plus a complete lack of fear is quite dangerous. However, if you are experiencing large amounts of anxiety/fear over things, to the point where it's affecting your ability to live normally, then you should speak to a therapist or psychiatrist. The first can help you deal with things better, and if you still need some help after that, a psychiatrist can prescribe meds that'll help you be more stable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What makes a species an individual one is essentially their ability to breed in nature and produce viable offspring. Humans happily breed together and make babies lol, so that makes us one species. Kind of like domestic dogs- there are a billion different varying breeds, but at the end of the day they don't care who they're making puppies with so long as its a dog. Things like ligers don't count because it would never happen in nature. There are a few rare exceptions for this and some blurry areas, as we did create the concept of species ourselves, but this is what humans go by for the most part.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one can be sure, really. Humans have done a lot to the earth, including decreasing animal diversity, making things go extinct, moving animals around, etc. Without them, scientists predict the world could have the biodiversity of the Serengeti, i.e large mammals on all continents, various birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc. Had they been allowed to spread unheeded, who knows what species would've been created and had a chance to flourish. Humans have set some animals back in an evolutionary sense, but chances are things still wouldn't really be advanced as they are today- but again, who knows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's one of those formentioned blurry areas. Scientists don't really know what to do with things like that when they see it with modern day species. Sometimes the result is considered a hybrid (such as the polar/grizzly bear mix) and other times they consider the result a new species. In our case, since homosapiens and neanderthals largely stayed with their own kind, we don't really take the few 'hybrids' into account, and since the percentages are so small now and days we can lump them in with homosapiens. Had this cross-breeding happened more extensively, it's possible an entirely new species could've been created instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bed frames, even if they're only a couple inches off the ground, allow for better circulation which prevents moisture, bacteria, and mites from finding a home underneath something as thick and absorbent as a mattress. It can be done cleanly of course, take for example japanese style futons. Care for one includes airing out the mattress in the sun about two times a month, beating out dust and dirt, and washing the covers. A normal mattress however is thick and heavy, and usually not able to be moved as easily as a futon- therefore things like this would be a pain, hence the bed frame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tegus don't really make good beginner lizards, as, due to their size, they require some more expensive/advanced care. However, I also don't believe in getting a 'starter' animal with the main goal being to upgrade later- it basically means you have to sit and care for an animal you never really wanted to begin with (Unless you want both! In which case, start with the easier one of course lol). I think if you put in enough research, watch tons of videos, try to see one in real life, then you should be fine to start with one. And for that last one I really recommend it, I know too many people who started with a big lizard, only to realize they were so scared of the size they ended up not handling them.</TEXT>

Once someone becomes that popular it puts them in even more of a position of power over others, which means should they want to do the same things again chances are they could get away with it. The guilt of knowing other people could be easily hurt because you didn't report it in time is a hard motivator. And yes, they could do it again when they weren't famous, but after you're assaulted like that the thought really doesn't come to mind until it's undeniably apparent, like when they become leagues more powerful through fame and money.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Found a white/albino sea turtle in a freshwater creek a couple hours out from the gulf about 10 years ago, but still haven't figured out how or why.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-22 21:48:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>About 8-10 years ago, me and my pops were fishing in a creek next to my grandmother's backyard. The creek runs for maybe 6 miles before ending, and for the most part is all behind residential land- however, near the end, it sits next to a swamp. When flooding occurs it connects to this (I live near houston, so this happens quite often). He caught something far too huge for the creek, we thought it was some sort of monster gar or catfish, but as it hit the surface we realized it was a turtle. This thing was absolutely huge, maybe a bit over a meter long, and my first thought was some kind of deformed softshell turtle from the size. Once it was on land there was no mistaking it, looked exactly like a sea turtle, but white/albino. We were kind of dumbfounded, so without really thinking the first thing we did was get the hook out of its mouth. As we got ready to take pics, the thing jetted off so hard and fast it knocked me on my ass, disappeared right into the water. Right after the incident I hit the web, even ended up contacting some aquariums, but I came up with nothing. I sat on maps forever trying to figure out if there was a sneaky way for the creek to connect to the ocean, but there's no possible way. This did happen right after hurricane ike, so I suppose its possible the creek connected to more than just the swamp, but none of the nearby bodies of water could reach the ocean. And even then, what are the chances of a sea turtle moving so far inland like that? My next theory has to do with local residents. Most of the houses on the creek are the hated mcmansions, so the people in them are either rich or well off. Would it be possible for someone into exotic animals to get their hands on an albino sea turtle? But then how would it break out? Either way though, it remains a mystery to me. I don't know why, but it still haunts me to this day and I remain eternally curious. Was thinking about it yet again, so decided why not post it lol, maybe someone here knows something I don't.</TEXT>

In this particular situation I don't think it's really a big invasion of privacy.

Usually people who have this, or just an excess of male/female hormones all on their own, take other things to correct it so they can keep the traits of their original gender. Most trans/nonbinary people don't have hormone imbalances that cause it.

    <TEXT>Well if you did this, you'd have to apply it to other areas as well. Think about all the people that are anti-war, the government would lose TONS of funding for the military. They'd lose money for border control too, there'd undoubtedly be people who don't want to fund public roads, schools, government jobs... it basically opens a can of worms no one wants to deal with. If they did try to apply it to one area it would probably get struck down immediately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While systematic racism *is* at the forefront right now, all the other things I mentioned are still current issues, just in the background for now. So while you could bring it up as the recent big issue in America, people would then bring these things up as a result. Also, setting up this system in no way deals with the issue at hand. Many officers and/or the people who lead them are racist. Racism would continue to persist among officers, and it would open the doors to things like officers opting out of helping POC folks because they 'assumed' they had opted out of tax funding. And people who did not opt out would still be treated poorly. The issue is not whether people will put their money where their mouth is, but actually implementing change within the police force.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea is that the government creates a new police/security force so it doesn't have to be from private sources. By implementing changes I just mean some things have to go, and if that means the whole darn force then so be it. BUT making it a partial thing, where some get it and some don't, defeats the purpose. Everyone needs protection at the end of the day and the current police aren't providing that, end of story. Taking it away and leaving nothing in its place fixes nothing. Black people have tried taking these things to court already, hundreds of times over, but police protection laws are a brick wall as well as racism within the courts. Quite frankly the whole country needs to change, but partitioning police literally does nothing at all and would only make things worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I say reform I mean change, or more specifically abolish. I do want the current police system gone, it hasn't worked for POC people ever in its entire history, and I sincerely doubt mental health allotments are going to help fix inherently racist officers and systems. Mental health for officers is a completely different subject as well, and not correlated. A racist officer is going to be racist, whether or not they have PTSD. If they were truly thinking irrationally due to mental health issues in situations of stress and that itself was the biggest issue, then we would be seeing equal ratios of death/injury by police.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of slave owners refused to stop until soldiers finally made it their way and forced them too, this took a bit of time. A lot of slaves would then go back with the army to the north, where they'd either join or go to freeman camps. These camps were supposed to help them get back on their feet, but they ended up not helping much. Many freemen ended up dying anyways from things like disease and malnutrition. A lot of people went on long searches for their lost family. Once people were somewhat settled they'd starting looking for work, and many ended up in sharecropping systems, which really ended up being slightly paid slavery. Long story short things didn't get that much better for quite some time, but it was certainly a level up from straight slavery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its already made huuuuge steps into becoming mainstream, I'd say its one step away if not already there. I used to be vaguely into it around 2010, and at the time it was a pretty niche thing in the US. Now and days it feels like everyone and their mom is into kpop or at the very least knows one or two songs. Since its considered a fandom there are bound to be certain traits attached to liking it, so there are going to be people who won't like it, but that doesn't mean it isn't mainstream.</TEXT>

I'm next to the very front seats on the field, and one of the kids leans over the railing and shows me their empty water bottle, asked if I could fill it up with a hose next to me. I say yes of course, because why not? Do the same for her two friends. Cop runs over and snatches the bottles out of the kids hands and starts telling me off for giving them water. Boss comes by to see what's happening and just stands there, staring at me as this asshole berates me and the kids who asked for water (gave no reason why, just said they don't need water over and over lol). When the cop leaves I turn to my boss and say "can you believe that?" He just stares at me in silence before walking away, doesn't talk to me for the rest of the day. Low and behold I get taken off the roster next time shifts are sent out, so I call and say I think I got left off. He then said "oh, I thought you quit". I figured I wasn't wanted for whatever reason and I didn't *need* the job, so I just let it happen. Was so awkward and weird.</TEXT>

I always recommend API meds like e.m erythromycin, or fin  amp; body cure, but any antibiotic with a solid reputation should do the trick. Don't use anything that touts 'gentle herbal remedy' of course, and always follow the instructions to a T, don't try to do a weak or half treatment, always go in full. I believe salt also works for fin rot but I'm not too sure, you'd have to check that your species will do fine with it and the correct measurements.</TEXT>

For UVB, you have to find the right balance where they get what they need, but not so intense it incurs skin damage- this balance can be hard to find. As for basking lights, they need appropriate heat but too much/too bright of a light will slowly turn them blind. I know a few owners time the lights so they're only on for short periods during the day. Eye damage can also come from UVB. I've heard some owners don't even offer UVB but instead supplement D3/only feel whole prey, but thats a bit debated. Lastly, due to breeding, albinos can have issues with energy levels and they might be somewhat inactive, which puts them at higher risk for obesity. If you got them from a reputable breeder, your best bet would be contacting them and asking them for albino care tips. If not, then the tegutalk forum has a lot of experienced owners who might be able to give you more specific information than I can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn't make him a bad kid because he has a different relationship than you did with your siblings, or a different frame of mind. You also have to take into consideration their ages and bonds, to be frank he probably isn't very close with his step sister. Consider the fact that hes an adult now who didn't grow up with her for 99% of his childhood, she might as well be on the same level as a cousin. I probably wouldn't feel any inclination to get her gifts either if I'm being honest, and I do currently give my siblings birthday/christmas gifts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take it with a grain of salt, but I've heard direct sunlight can be questionable. But I should also add there are plenty of people with albinos who, with average tegu care, never get bad vision/show any signs of skin damage, even those who are housed outside. I think a lot of it does depend on lineage, but yeah, take my info with some salt lol. And for gauging any skin damage, I'd just look for aversions to their lighting, tender skin, and/or any of the general signs of sickness. Lastly, owning a tegu is a rewarding experience and despite the lighting challenges I hope you have some good tegu fun, best of luck!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest your chances of being able to get a salpingectomy, at least from a reputable surgeon, are going ton be pretty slim. Since you don't have any complications that make the procedure necessary, it's an invasive procedure, and you already have your tubes tied, you'll be hard pressed to find a doctor that will give the okay. The first step would be seeing a general practitioner/gynecologist and getting a recommendation to a surgeon if you're deadset on getting this done, although you'll probably have to go through several doctors before you'll find one that'll make it happen.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>South american egg and sausage bread?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 12:42:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I myself never ate it, but it was in a video we had to watch in my Spanish class years ago. I can't remember which country it was about specifically. The bread was for a certain holiday, and had whole, hard-boiled eggs in it along with big sausage pieces (possibly chorizo?). It was an actual bread, not just like a casserole type thing. When they cut into it they could get the cross sections of egg and sausage, but there wasn't a lot of it in the bread, like they didn't take up a significant part of it. I also want to say the bread was sweet? The video said tons of people, especially women would all get together to make it since it took a lot of time. This part I'm especially not sure on, but I think the bread might of been like brioche in appearance, shiny brown top and yellow on the inside, but that part I'm very vague on.

    <TEXT>Was born in Cali, near the coast. Most of the nature I grew up with was just beaches lol. Family eventually moved to Texas and I got a kick out of the wildlife, would go on this obscure trail through a little forest/swampy area with just the dog all the time. One day I ended up staying out late into the evening, and I heard the most blood curdling noise from the trees, dog (who was a 160lb monster) took off so fast he ended up dragging me across the ground on my ass. Noise kept happening and I ran home ready to piss my pants. I now know it was just a goddamn boar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Had a friend who I legitimately thought was, for lack of better words, starbucks loving rich white girl. Texted like a 13 year old girl, spoke very frou-frou and high pitched. We lived in the same area, so we ended up meeting up before I got to know them more for a concert. I'm looking for said blonde, when a beefy, tattooed dude taps me on the shoulder. Speaks, and lo and behold, he's the one. I was never under any false impressions, he told me the right age, mentioned he had a few tattoos (I was thinking like... Ankle dolphins or something). But he just didn't match the personality. Very nice dude though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In that case I wouldn't worry about pH, I'm not sure what numbers you're trying to hit but unless you intend on getting some ultra sensitive fish or you're trying to breed a specific species, then it doesn't matter save for the extremes. As for the ammonia, once your tank is cycled it actually won't matter too much with the right conditioner, such as prime. It binds ammonia/chlorine/chloramines so its nontoxic to fish, and then before it can unbind the bacteria will take care of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not always the case of course, but most women have bad experiences as far as men complimenting them. A lot of men will do it to hit on them, and will do so in a very pushy way. So it often comes off as the man complimenting with an ulterior motive, whether that's what they actually meant or not- i.e it makes all compliments seem fake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ehh it would depend on the size of the tanks and how much you're moving over from the old one, I'd say. If you move the old filter as well as either substrate, deco, plants, etc from the old tank you should probably be okay cycle wise (and should also move the old tank water too probs). But if the tank you're upgrading to is more than double the size of the last I'd say its a bit iffy, although it would probably still be okayish. I'm no expert though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Planaria is (for the most part) only harmful to shrimp and snails, but if you see them in excess it usually means theres issues with water quality/tank environment. You'll want to check your parameters and make sure they're A-OK, and after that you can treat the tank. I don't know all the options but I do know some people use panacur (fenbendazole), although I don't know the exact dosages for tanks. If you haven't already, I'd hold up a magnifying glass and make sure its planaria, they look very similar to another, far more common flatworm thats pretty normal to have in the tank, noticeable difference being headshape of course (planaria is triangle, benign one is round), so you don't end up unnecessarily treating the tank. Best of luck!</TEXT>

If the rock bubbles, then that's your culprit. However, 8.2 isn't so bad for a betta, they could easily adapt. Some plants might have iffy growth, but most should be fine as well.</TEXT>

Yes, 911 should be called first, but why did you wait for the hospital to call her instead of calling her at any point in between 911 and going to the hospital? If you just forgot in the panic then n-t-a, but otherwise you should've done so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure tbh! So first ones I see are anubias nana, broad, dark green leaved ones. They have to grow glued/tied down to rocks and driftwood, because if their rhizome is buried they'll rot- so you'll want to pull those little dudes up. One in the back with the lined leaves looks like Asian water fern, did you get it from petco/petsmart? They often sell it as an aquatic plant but it's actually not, they'll sit for a bit underwater but eventually die back, if you still can I'd return it. As for the three small guys in the front, one looks like anubias nana petite which has the same issues as anubias nana. The next one going right looks like microsword which should be okay as is, and I'm not sure about the last but it should be okay as well. Now for the carpet you have going on, was that from seed? Most seeds aren't actually aquatic plants but various types of flood plane plants- they'll germinate underwater but will eventually die off. If you got them from a reputable source they might be okay, but otherwise they probably won't grow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Otos can be a bit difficult to keep, as they're often farmed/wild caught and once the algae is gone they have a hard time switching to wafers/pellets. However if your tank has a good constant supply they're definitely an option. As for plecos, my little guy takes out algae like nobody else, but they have a HUGE bioload and make a lot of poop dust lol. Mysteries are okay, but you have to be vigilant about scraping off their eggs or they'll take over your tank. Nerites make a much better option in my opinion, as they can munch through a lot of algae and can't breed in freshwater.</TEXT>

Do you have any pics of the little guys? Just to see if there's anything visual on them. Otherwise you could probably try treating with something like general cure. On a side note, if your test kit is acting up it's possible it might be faulty, can happen even with a new kit. I'd buy some cheap strips and see if the parameters fall in the same range.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Group cheating. Me and a group of acquaintances, wouldn't even call us friends lol, got together and decided we'd cheat on the final exam. I ended up being the key holder because I was the least likely to be suspected. I would casually hold my fingers over the side of the desk- 1 finger up meant A, 2 is B, 3 is c, and so on. Flashing all of my fingers twice meant I didn't know the answer. I had written all the info down real tiny and cut the paper up into several pieces, which I stashed in my front hoodie pocket. I could pull em out and fit them into the sleeves of said hoodie, and could peak where I wouldn't be seen. Elaborate, but we all got an A+.</TEXT>

A lot of banana flavoring these days is actually based off an old cultivar called gros michel, which was a lot different and sweeter (think the flavor of banana taffy), but since it went extinct we now eat the cavendish variety. Cherry flavored things are going to generally be a bit more sweet/artificial/less sour than the real deal as well.</TEXT>

As someone who's autistic, I tend to struggle with relationships a lot, but the key for me has just been actually putting my mind to it like a project. Some people can keep friends rather effortlessly, but you have to accept that its never going to be you. Mark reminders into your phone that you should talk to whomever at blank intervals so you don't end up ghosting them, make notes in your own head on how to start conversations and keep conversations going, really think about what you're going to say before you speak, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of the biggest things I'd say you have to consider: 1. How do the next 15+ years of your life look? They're going to live a very, very long time and you have to consider if you have the stability in your own life for that. 2. Are you ready for the expenses? These are expensive animals with expensive upkeep. They need good food, a big enclosure, and exotic vets tend to cost $100+ for the appointment alone, and chances are you will have to go to the vet more than once. 3. Are you ready to handle a mean lizard? While a lot of tegus are very sweet and tame, some can have a bit more attitude than others and they all go through puberty. Make sure you can handle and won't freak out if you have a powerful lizard who isn't too happy with you, because there are some situations where it's just not possible to back off. 4. Are you ready for the time commitment? If you want a tame tegu you're going to have to put in the hours, you can't spend a handful of minutes a day with them and expect amazing results- they're going to need almost daily attention for the rest of their lives. At the end of the day no one is going to be 100% ready for their new pet and there's always going to be more questions, but so long as you know you can handle things long term and you've done all the research you possibly can, you should be set.</TEXT>

They were extremely quiet, only occasionally whispering to each other, and just stared at us the entire time. When we first noticed we thought they were, idk, racist or something maybe? But even if they didn't like us why would they just sit there and stare for so long. Even after they had finished eating. I finally got up and spoke to the waitress quietly, and they asked the family to leave if they weren't going to buy anymore food, and thankfully they did. Very unnerving.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-19 04:50:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been struggling with my mental health for a while now and its just tiring. Therapy has been okay for me, but I've been more and more curious about seeing a psychiatrist. I'm, and I'm not sure of the exact word, maybe passively suicidal? The thought floats around my head for most of the day and I catalog ways I could do it, but my guilt keeps me here. I'd feel absolutely horrible if I did that to my family and friends, even though I might want to. One of the big things I keep hearing about meds is that they can make you numb/mellow. I worry that if I started them I'd lose the feelings that keep me here. Is this the case? Should I be considering meds at all while I'm like this? Would I be aware enough to know I need to be prescribed something else? I'm just not sure how it all works/how I'd go about it and could use some advice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently tried mastic/mastiha as a chewing gum and really liked it, but I've found it to be quite expensive. Is there anything else like it that's cheaper? And by like it I mean unsweetened and preferably with a similar taste, idk how to describe it other than tree flavored.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well first off, you're not pathetic at all and you sound like a fine person. Secondly, its not my relationship so take this however you will, but he sounds like a jerk. Even if you guys get along in other areas, the type of behavior you've mentioned is inconsiderate and just plain unacceptable. I know you don't want to hurt him/he's already going through some other mental health issues, but I can't stress this enough- it's not your problem. It sounds a bit harsh, but at the end of the day his mental health cannot rely on you being there, its something that has to support itself regardless. If you think leaving is the best option, don't worry about the other things, just worry about yourself. If this whole thing is making you miserable, there's no point in sticking around- cliche as it is, there's a billion fish in the sea. If you're dedicated to making this work you can try, but he also has to put in the same effort, it can't be one sided. If he isn't reciprocating then it unfortunately is not worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You've probably heard this one but if you do your research, some small time investing isn't too bad of a side hustle, and you can increase it a nice bit if you put in the effort and have the patience. Another thing you could do if you have the time is reselling- theres tons of sites (but make sure they're legit of course) that sell bulk liquidation pallets. Usually things like amazon, walmart, bestbuy, etc returns that are for the most part perfectly fine. You can buy them for $100, then resell everything on sites like ebay/craiglist and get your money back double/several times over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of it might still linger, but your best bet would be wiping down walls, sprinkling baking soda on the carpet and vacuuming up after a couple hours/renting a carpet cleaner. However on another note, when professionally done an ozone treatment should have no effect on you or your animals. Ozone is basically used to fill your room, and through whatever chemical processes removes the smell, and then within a couple hours it just reverts back to non toxic oxygen. The dangers of ozone only apply to spaces that are occupied, if no one's there for the duration of the treatment/a bit afterwards, then everything will be fine.</TEXT>

If she's the same size and she's not running around her cage/only comes out to bask and drink, there's a chance she's just active during brumation.

    <TEXT>Some people consider it a bad mentality, but at some point you just have to start being selfish. At the end of the day you're here for you- don't be a shitty person to other people of course, but don't go out of your way to do things that are going to mess up your life and inconvenience you. Take the time to do things that make you happy, be a bit hedonistic at times. But also, and I recognize it's a bit contradictory, if it's something you enjoy, don't be afraid to help others if you're in a position to do so. You may be a cog, but that doesn't change the fact that you can help out other cogs and make their days or lives a little better. You can't help or be recognized by everyone, but you can do little things that make your own life meaningful to you and others you care about. Basically, make the best out of what you've got and don't worry so much about the big picture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not me directly sort of, but when I was a toddler I was staying at my grandma's house. Middle of the night someone comes banging on the door, grandma gets up, looks out and finds no one there. Sees a ton of smoke though, looks out and part of the house is on fire. We got out in time, but otherwise we probably wouldn't slept through it and died.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're good! Everyone has their own feelings about what their gender means to them, I suppose mine is just more in line with societal norms than others might be. And I guess being a masculine woman just wasn't enough for me? It's hard to describe why I've placed the line where I have, but I want to go all the way really lol. I do wonder sometimes if I'd be okay as a very masculine woman if society was more accepting of it, but it is what it is for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wouldn't let me copy paste another comment where I explained it better but long story short, what I want out of being a man happens to fall within societal norms/expectations, but everyone is different and is welcome to their preferences as to how they portray and feel about gender. And yup, gender itself is a fairly arbitrary concept so I guess at the end of the day it's all moot. Can't really say there are any concrete facts to go on because of that- so I guess what I'm trying to say is labels are shit and do what you want, I just happen to like identifying as a man and he/him pronouns + what society attributes to that, if that makes sense? Idk, it's all very hard to put down in writing lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is just in my experience, but I'd say its sort of like this. Anarchy- I'd say it's less about destroying government as a whole, but more destroying the current one for a more preferable, left leaning and democratic system. Liberals- the conservatives of the left world. They want left leaning ideals, but believe it can still be done within the confines of the current system. Socialism- similar to the anarchists in that they want a new form of government, but are less focused on the dismantling and more focused on changing things with the direct goal of helping people who need it.</TEXT>

Fryers remove moisture by having oil boil it away, but it also leaves behind grease which does impart flavors that you won't get from airfrying.

    <TEXT>Not my personal story, but my dad's. He was around 13-14, on a farm up in arkansas with an uncle. Got up really early one morning, and walked down the hall to the kitchen, saw his uncle out working through a window. As he approached, he saw a huge shadow and heard things being knocked over. The shadow was shaped like a huge man, and he swears it lifted up wings, made a weird screeching noise, and then ran out the door as soon as it heard him. Ran back down the hall, flung open the window, and climbed out to his uncle. When they went back, something had been digging through the pantries. Uncle thought my dad was pranking him and no one really believed him. He's a tough man, but to this day he believes he saw the mothman and is absolutely terrified of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You'd shoot back to 230 without propper exercise. To simplify the whole thing, lets say you eat 2500 calories a day with minimal exercise. This is just enough fuel to keep you at 230, no more and no less. If your goal weight is, say, 170lbs, lets say you'd need to drop your caloric intake to 1500 a day to support that weight. You can cut down on calories by either straight up not eating them, or burning them through exercise. So you can go down to 170, but if you're eating/retaining more calories than you need you'll just bounce right back to where you started. The key to keeping weight off is manageable lifestyle changes- you can do some extreme gym routine or diet to get the weight off, but if its not something you can keep up with for the rest of your life then you're bound to repeat the same mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can't remember the name of a relatively obscure anime I watched years ago, maybe around 2015? Although I doubt that date coincides with it's release. I don't remember much of the main plot, but at the end I think they're on top of a train, fighting, and the antagonist(?) Ends up hanging off somewhere about to fall and die. Protag tries to hold on and save her, but she cuts her own arm off and falls, but later they reveal she's still alive. Think there was another girl in the show as well, more of a side character with green(?) hair, and her voice could kill people so she never talked. Ends up getting tricked, thinks she's talking to bad guy but is actually talking to the one she loves and kills him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its a pretty even match up but I'd say the second. With the first a person's intentions are pretty darn obvious and as a result most people will actively try to stop them. For the second though, they'll keep preaching about how much good they're trying to do and that they're the best, and inevitably there are going to be a lot of people who'll support and believe them because of their conviction.</TEXT>

Had to get up at 5am and head to morning practice for 9th and 10th graders, which was until 12. Then lunch break till 1, and back at it for 11th and 12th grade practice till 6pm. Game days meant I'd sometimes hop off the bus at midnight, and still had to make the drive home. Keep in mind, all of this was outside in the texas heat, and we weren't allowed to sit down because then we 'wouldnt be ready for emergencies'. We didn't get cold water either, was warm hose water in squirt bottles I had to share with hundreds of highschoolers. I quit after two weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. Carnivore meat doesn't necessarily taste disgusting, it just hasn't been something made mainstream. For example, the meat from wild boars will taste objectively worse than the meat of domestic pigs because it will be gamier and have less fat, not so much because of diet. Plenty of cultures still eat carnivores, it just can't be done on a large scale. Feeding carnivores and keeping them together in large numbers as we do with current livestock would be an absolute nightmare and just can't be done at the level the meat industry operates on today. So really the only things holding us back are 1. The diet of carnivores regarding sourcing and price, 2. The difficulty with raising them in large numbers, and 3. Cultural taboos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So just to be clear, you're trying to overlay colors onto the screen itself so that it appears 3D to you? If thats the case, then unfortunately it won't work. The way 3D images work are by projecting a normal image with overlapped red and blue variants. When you put on 3D glasses, they either only show the blue to one eye, or only show the red to one eye, and your brain combines the images to create a 3D one. If you overlay it on the screen itself you simply create another image entirely, as your brain is not creating the 3D image in this instance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, yes but not quite. Lets say there's a 1 in 1000 chance of someone having disorder A, and a 1 in 2000 chance of someone having disorder b. That would mean there are roughly 10 million people in the world with disorder A and/or B. That's sounds like a lot, but 10 million is only about .14% of the world's population. So when looked at in terms of actual numbers it seems like a hell of a lot, when it comes down to percentages it's smaller than you'd think. Not to say a lot of people don't have genetic disorders, but I'm assuming you're talking more in terms of more visually/physically significant ones.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Coccidia in bioactive enclosure/treating tegu?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 03:34:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm pretty sure my little tegu has coccidia (another reptile close to him had it, will be confirmed with a fecal test ofc). I know most of the fight is keeping the enclosure clean, but I'm not really sure how to do so, as it can be hard to spot poop and I don't always manage to grab all of it (hence the clean up crew). Normally I'd probably steam the soil everyday, but that would kill the bugs. Could I put him in a separate q tank on damp napkins? How long would it be before the enclosure is safe to use again? Any help is appreciated, thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should vote. To be frank, the reason a lot of people who can but choose not to vote do so because the outcome doesn't affect them. You have to consider the hundreds upon hundreds of other people who could benefit from you just registering and hitting up a polling station. Plus you don't have to actually go on social media/meet up with family and friends and begin debating your positions just because you voted- just do some unbiased research and place your cards. No one can force you to hold your stance, especially if you've done your civic duty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would be slime mold! Not often seen in aquariums, especially in big enough numbers to where they appear like this. They're composed of single cell organisms that group together to form one big multicellular blob, which is why it moves. While not harmful to your fish, they do enjoy decaying matter so it's most likely a sign of overfeeding. To start getting rid of it, your best bet is to scrub away/vacuum up what you can, and keep the substrate clean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could maybe be the driftwood? (If that's what I'm seeing in your vid that is) If you can, pull it out of the tank and see if it's brittle/snaps easier than it should, or is a little too bendy, that would be the rotting stuff it's eating then. Otherwise I don't have much info unfortunately, it's just so rare that there isn't a lot of good stuff out there. If you do a total redo (although I'm not exactly sure how it works) I'd keep your fish and snails in a quarantine of sorts with lots of water changes, as they can survive outside of those bunches and it would just take a couple of cells to start that colony back up in a new set up.</TEXT>

To give myself more time for this one dance I knew I was bad at, I pretended I sprained something in my back. That only held up for 4 days so I finally went to a doctor and faked my ass off, left with some strong pain meds and a note excusing me until my next doc appt in 20 days. They gave me an x ray then and there was actually something legitimately wrong with my spine so I got another note until I could see a specialist in a month. I would've called it off by then but my teach was still insisting I do the dance when I was better. Teacher goes into labor a few days before I see the specialist and would be gone for the rest of the school year, so in the end I never saw the doc and I procrastinated my way out of it. To this day I have no idea what was up with my spine but I can't say I give a damn</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The electoral college usually votes off of the majority of their area, at least for the most part, so there is still some salt in voting. I'm also of the belief that if you want a say, you vote. I won't listen to shit someone has to say about politics if they haven't even bothered voting (at least if they actually can vote ofc). To the main body of your question though, you can vote third party if you want, but they certainly aren't going to win, it just takes away a vote from blue or red. The reason people are so heated at the moment is because the difference between the two sides is extreme, and the key differences are arguably more than just politics at this point, but far greater issues. To the people on either side, you're wasting a vote because there's honestly no way third is going to win, so you're taking away a vote that could've been used elsewhere. You can still vote third party of course, I have my own personal opinions on the matter but from an unbiased standpoint the point of voting is to show your own views of what you want for your country, and if it's third party then that's what's right for you. At the end of the day, just place a vote you won't regret.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So many signs with me lol. Almost every other day at school (starting in kindergarten) I'd "get a stomach ache" and have to go home sick. I had no friends, I didn't like other people, and a therapist said there was something wrong with me but we ended up moving states so my parents never followed up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you mean the kind that tends to happen when you jump down from somewhere, it's all about the landing. Your feet act a bit like a spring when you jump, your heel in particular. When you do a normal jump, you'll notice you usually land from toe to heel, thus dispersing the energy from said jump. When you jump down, or land down in a weird way, that energy can't quite shoot out and up like it wants and instead jarrs your heel and ankle, causing that sharp pain. It's why people who do frequent big jumps usually tuck and roll instead of landing flat on their feet.</TEXT>

Human hair is colored via melanin which can only do solid black or yellow in different tones, where as, a zebra for example, has their melanin dispersed in streaks.

    <TEXT>Depends on how you're willing to live, really, but I'm assuming you'd want to go modern. Initially you'd need to get plumbing, a water source, electricity, gas, gasoline, possibly diesel out there. Then you'd need to build houses of course, with adequate protection from the environment. Then comes retail, you'd probably want some manufacturing jobs as well, a whole local economy and what not. Then you'd need money to maintain everything, ideally from taxes but in the beginning you wouldn't have much. At the end of the day you're looking at billions in start up, before things can become more self sustaining.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on what you need help in. If you're struggling with actual technical skills then I'd recommend classes geared towards whatever your specific struggle is, but if you just want to up your game in general then I'd say experience/practice is best, just putting pen to paper and getting it done. Don't get me wrong, sometimes a professor can offer a new perspective, but at the same time you could just as easily get a prof that sucks and have a wasted class. I'd say you could get the same input if you immerse yourself in a supportive online community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I initially started tong feeding my tegu, but despite my best efforts and non-food related handling several times a day, he still associated my fingers (and toes on occasion lol) with food and would try to eat them. It was fine when he was 1 month old, but now that he's older it's starting to hurt. About a month ago I switched to putting food in his tank before he woke up so he wouldn't make the connection anymore, but if he's even the slightest bit hungry he'll still go for my fingers. Does anyone have tips for working on this? Should I still be waiting it out?</TEXT>

I took the card out, used an air duster and brushed things off, but it still said it wasn't detected. Tried a different card, nothing happened. Tried the original card in a different phone, was picked up just fine, so I'm assuming it's an issue with the phone itself at this point. Is there anything else I can try at home to fix this?
