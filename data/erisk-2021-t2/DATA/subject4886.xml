    <TEXT>So im growing on YT and its fairly consistent at around 1 subscriber per week, i have a total of 15 subs and ive been on YT for around 2 months. Im looking at my analytics and my growth and views are happening through the links i share on other sites relevent to my niche BUT around 10 percent is coming from YT itself. Im wondering how i can boost the views on YT itself seeing only 10 percent are from YT. Ive done some really good SEO and im just thinking on how to get that 1 extra view on YT - im thinking my channel doesnt get recommended on YT enough maybe?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my latest videos I just released like less than 3 hours ago, My last video done pretty well for my channel so i decided to follow it up with this release. It's just me playing CoD zombies by myself...cause no friends lol \- Something I'm trying to work on is more watch time, I can see in the analytics that the view time is not as good as my past video's and I sort of know why, Ive had people talk about voice over and maybe music so I may have to implement these in my video's. \- [https://youtu.be/DgKDxvRVwf0](https://youtu.be/DgKDxvRVwf0)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crowded?, no way that's what YT is good for, having a diverse audience for different people to watch. Hell some people wont even watch your video's if you have black hair, people are picky so then they go to the next YT person so would I say It's crowded...No The second and third part of your question I'm going to skip as that is up to how motivated you are as a content creator and promoter, Yes promotion comes with it As for the thumbnail It is VERY crucial that you create a eye grabbing thumbnail, It could be the difference between 1 view to 100 views, I have a old video of mine that has had no thumbnail for around 2 months and It has 20 view, whereas my recent video's have thumbnails and have 50 views in the first day</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just watched a couple of your videos and I have a few tips, and by no way am I putting you down I'm also out here grinding okay :) 1. Titles : The titles of your videos are looking a bit generic For example - one of your videos is called "Apex legand". From my point of view that title can be spiced up a little also its misspelled, I don't personally play apex but I would put the title as "APEX SOLO GRIND" or "LET'S KILL SOME TEAMS // APEX LEGENDS" or something along those lines. 2. Script : It is always a good idea to jot down some ideas on a paper to keep things rolling just in case there are some "dead spaces" in the video, some of your videos I'm left sitting there waiting for more commentary but it's silent so maybe jot down some ideas like : "Whats is the new updates for apex - and are you happy about them" and "What guns do you think are awesome" - there are alot of things you can say throughout the video which could keep you yapping on, and you never know you might just spark up a chat in your comment section like that.  #8203; 3. Intro and Outro : This goes in line with scripting, I want to know what is going to happen and what "Game mode" or what ever it is that your going to be doing in the video before it happens. "Why is that" because I want to know if I want to sit and watch the rest of the video, YES you do have a title that says "Apex" but are you playing in teams? Are you just talking about it? Are you rating it out of 10? - I think telling your audience would help alot, the outro is simple with a call to action so they dont forget to sub ect...  #8203; And just so your wondering, there is a lot more you can do which I'm too busy to speak of but there is always ALWAYS room for improving. And as I said I'm not putting you down, I'm just like you with 25 subs and 53 videos with only 3 months of being on YT so we all out here grinding  #8203; \- Hope this helps little Homie</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-02 04:52:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been looking into the legal side of YouTube. I'm a Gaming Content Creator on YouTube and I want to have ownership of gaming footage that I record with others. Essentially I want my collaborations with others to be strictly professional, There are a lot of YouTubers who work together and for what ever reason one side of the party gets jealous and reports it to YouTube. YouTube then removes the content because there is no proof that these 2 parties actually considered working together... I looked this up on Google and I believe a Media Release form can help with this as it states that both parties give the person recording all rights to what ever footage...is this correct?  #8203; \- also sorry I didnt know what flair to use...</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-07 04:51:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I run a small YouTube and I was wondering if having a social media is a big thing to have, I create alot of gaming videos and I'm curious because all the promoting I do is based off just sharing the video around in niche forums similar to what I'm creating. I get that if I was a bigger YouTuber that having a social would be good but right now would it be beneficial? if so, how can it benefit me? Considering my fan base isnt "Big" at the moment</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree to a certain point. Yes YouTube does convert 1440p into a codec called vp09 and yes it does perceive better to one with a untrained eye BUT 1. You cant add quality to a video once its been recorded. This means by upscaling to a higher res your actually hurting "quality" 2. YouTube will look pixelated if your render settings are incorrect. 3. YouTube will look pixelated if you haven't color corrected your image. 2 and 3 can be explained into many sub categories but I don't have time right now. \- My conclusion, stick to native res, get your settings correct and you should be good. Up scaling is not a option</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just checked your channel and there are a few things I can say, First of all, what is your channel about?, what is your niche? what should the viewers expect? I see a card trick then an ideas video....do you know what you want to do? Secondly, making a living on YouTube is hard - the reality is that you should get a real job and have this as a hobby so in 5 years time if youve worked hard enough and have a big fan base you can quit your day job. Yes it can take years even more than 5. Third and final. DONT worry about money or living off YouTube when you havent even reached 1000 subs and 4000 hours watch time, and even when you get there youve still go a long way to go...Worry about having fun and entertaining people instead of the money my friend</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've got a question about reducing noises coming from your keyboard</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-14 06:34:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I've always wondered how big YouTubers cancel out their keyboard noises as I know how loud keyboard noises are. I did however come across a little reddit post from 2 years ago that states the following: "As others have pointed out already, you need to turn down the gain on your microphone as far as possible. The gain is the amplification of your **input** signal. People incorrectly conflate gain with volume and loudness. Increasing your gain will have the side-effect of increasing your **output** signal, or volume. However, that isn't what it is there for. So in this case, having a lower gain means it takes more energy, or amplitude of the soundwave for the microphone to hear it. Thus, low energy or softer sounds are less likely to be recorded, ie your keyboard presses, mouse clicks, noisy neighbors, traffic outside, etc. So the opposite is true: high gain means it takes less energy, or amplitude of the soundwave for the microphone to hear it. If you crank up the gain all the way, your microphone can probably hear things in other rooms in the house that you may not even be able to hear with your naked ears. (this is how recording 'bugs' work for surveillance). So in summary, you want very little gain on your microphone, and you will likely have to speak more loudly to get a clear recording at a suitable loudness. You may also need to adjust the **output** volume from your microphone via your operating system. The physics of how this works is much more complicated, but I think this should be comprehensive enough for you to understand what the problem is and how to fix it. Source: I'm an Audio/Video Technician for a living and majored in film production."  #8203; So as you can see this person is implying on people to turn the gain down, would it be correct to turn the gain down, getting closer to the mic and speaking louder to get better noise rejection?. Also I want to add this to the conversation, Isnt gain staging also a important aspect so if turning the gain down actually works, isnt that improper gain staging? \- I'm no sound professional, just a curious person :)</TEXT>

Or maybe I worded it wrong.

    <TEXT>So, I've been watching alot of older zombie titles earlier than 1990s and alot of them portray zombies as being "Cursed" or have a spell/ritual that awaken the dead. Now looking at modern zombie titles you see that zombies are made by a human being infected by a virus or exposed to something made in a lab.  #8203; Are there any other ways you've seen zombies being either created or awaken ect?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That first mock up seems to be a bit complex, there is alot happening in it and I tend to lose focus on what the banner is actually suppose to display... Are you trying to make sure we all can read your name? OR Are you trying to make sure we know what your channel covers?  #8203; IMO your mock picture doesnt represent your channel covering tech, life or other topics. It does however make me think 'what does this channel cover' as there are a bunch of cameras, microphones and watches....Okay the mic and camera would make me feel like you cover electronics but then we have the watch and I can't match that with anything.  #8203; And then you have your channels name in the middle....  #8203; Conclusion - It can be alot more effective, if I was in your situation I would have in simple bold writing :  #8203; **Crane Reviews** 'Tech  amp; Lifestyle'  #8203; Then I would put maybe 2 - 6 photos in the squares that are on your mock up, make sure these 2 - 6 photos are of different things that you cover and make them fit the whole banner, this will then show that you cover these items specifically and it also shows in writing that you review tech and life style</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm new to the whole keyboard building and I was wondering what you people think about me buying the "Glorious GMMK TKL Mech Keyboard". What are your thoughts on this, or is it cheaper to just build my own keyboard? I think a goal that I want to achieve is I really want to be able to experience all key switches as I'm new to the scene and getting a hot swappable keyboard is probably the way to start?</TEXT>

I was more worried on why there were guards that didn't already deal with the enemy monstors, and another thing is that I was thinking "how could strelok live here with the monstors" like wtf. Another thing in the first tunnel is that the monstor that can pull your vision forward isn't scary it's actually annoying. So this next tunnel should live up to the hype right?</TEXT>

Also "my style may change" if I get the tattoo in a few years time, "yes" my style may change 10 years later, if I get the tattoo at 50 years old my style may change at 60. Isn't this all...what humans are, we change right? Also if I dont respond I will be on tomorrow  #128578; Just 1am and I need to be at work in 4 hours  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't mind the futuristic look that is the "new"  #8203; But I wouldn't mind some WW2 vibes back or some real nasty gore, Old school styles you know?. I also feel as though zombies guns are....meh, I would like to see some variety like maybe 100 guns imported as this will give some replay ability. The reason why I say this is because I only play BO3 zombies only if it's custom, it feels like every time you play it's the same damn guns....there is like what....30 guns max? and we all know about 15 of them aren't that good so you end up hoping you get the other 15....  #8203; This is my opinion anyway</TEXT>

Just everything changed and it felt like I didn't know what the hell I was doing.  #8203; And I wouldn't say that I hate it now I feel as though it will be a learning experience, just maybe not right now...sometime in the future I will revisit it if it is still relevant that is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are talking about specific maps, to make it as "casual" as you say, you will need to be experienced and will have to learn the map. It's not "hard" for noobs they just need time to adapt to the map that they are playing, hell I thought Shi No Numa was hard and now that I have taken the time to learn the map I can get to round 50 no sweat. So in my opinion, it's only as hard as you make it or in your words "casual" Just need time to learn the map</TEXT>

    <TITLE>YouTube Titles and Thumbnails - How do you create effective Titles and Thumbnails</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 08:53:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>What is the structure (creative process) you go through when creating a title, and a thumbnail?, I think the hardest part about the YouTube process for me is coming up with a title, theoretically I can have any title I want but I think you and I know that Isn't the ideal way of thinking. Titles and thumbnails are more elaborate and take time to get right so how do you do it and how do you think of titles and thumbnails and what process do you take to put this plan into action?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think we are the same, I have a gaming channel and I know most people in my genre use "THE MOST" or "THE BEST" in their titles and I think it's a bit overused in my opinion and I find it hard to find that point where its not so exaggerated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to save this here, thanks for the info. I usually use the text/image combo for the thumbnail and I tried other methods but for where I am at in my channel I feel as though this is the best as the reader gets both a visual and a bit of text, Can I ask, what sort of text should be on your thumbnail and what text should be on your title? can they be the same and is this effective or would you change both the title and thumbnail text? what is your opinion on that?</TEXT>
