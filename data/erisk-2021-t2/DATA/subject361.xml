    <TITLE>(425) 657-3108 calling for my "arrest warrant"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-31 21:08:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I just found this subreddit today. I got a call from this number, claiming that the IRS has an arrest warrant against my name and identity. The voice was automated female text, and told me to call the number back to avoid the warrant being presented to my police station. I called back, and got the most generic, thick Indian accent in existence. Just thought I'd slap this number on here for you guys to do what you please with. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I lived with this shitty person for a while and I couldn #8217;t afford a phone plan because my rent was so expensive and I worked at McDonald #8217;s. I wanted to know my credit score and signed up for this website that asked for my billing information, but I was just doing a trial. I went to go cancel my trial as it wasn #8217;t even showing my credit score, but it was through phone. Literally had no way to call them (couldn #8217;t use my  #8220;roommates #8221; phone) , got charged and over drafted within a day instead of the promised 30 days and was homeless for a few months because I couldn #8217;t afford rent. TL;DR - Don #8217;t sign up for things if you don #8217;t have a phone because you #8217;ll become homeless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s many different ways to take 5-HTP, and they all vary based on many factors. An idea for you would be taking the 5-HTP in the morning with a green tea extract supplement, specifically a 1:4 ratio, I.E. 100mg 5-HTP to 400mg of EGCG (the sought after ingredient in GT extract). If stomach discomfort isn #8217;t an issue, make sure it #8217;s on an empty stomach. If you do experience nausea, sourness, etc. then have a light meal with it but nothing too heavy. Along with this, you can take the same stack at night before bed, that way you #8217;re getting a higher dosage while reducing side effects. A few notes about 5-HTP 1. EGCG (GT extract) is essential to avoid heart valve damage and to maximize effects in the brain. 2. A time release version of 5-HTP may work better for you, best taken once a day and only before bed if so. 3. Serotonin is selfish. If you take 5-HTP daily without cycling (taking days/weeks off) or supplementing with L-tyrosine as well properly, your dopamine levels will fall. Both of these supplements compete but also synergies. r/nootropics will be able to help you out more and give you more backed up advice, but I hope that was enough general knowledge to get you on the right track. As for your question about different doses for anxiety and depression, 200-300mg is a good starting point based on how severe either are. You want to take these throughout the day of course, and the dosage will be the same whether or not your taking it for one or the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The other supplement is green tea extract, and as long as the label states it contains 90% polyphenols, then that means it has EGCG in it. This is essential for allowing the 5-HTP to remain unconverted in the gut, and instead sending it to the brain where it can become usable serotonin. I generally do 5-HTP for four days, and then cycle with l-tyrosine the next three in order to balance my levels. If you take a time release version at night, it will make your sleep quality amazing and cause vivid dreams. You should wake up feeling a million bucks  #128181;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They made everything super colorful, my white walls becoming pastel textures and colors of yellow and pink. Certain designs or patterns would grow and become more intricate; staring at a nug would cause it to spiral and twirl in place. I had a massive feeling of empathy for my dog, and petted it for like an hour straight while stretching out my muscles. Unlike LSD, it was an extremely relaxing experience and melted away any tension of stress. In lower doses, it #8217;s like the opioid of psychedelics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took it as science only bases its decisions off evidence that is known at the time of said decision, and little forethought is given to the unknown evidence. In short, we don #8217;t give a fuck about the nonexistent evidence, because it doesn #8217;t exist yet. How about that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people can smoke and completely lose social anxiety. It really depends on your chemistry, environment, and what you make of a situation. When I #8217;m high around my parents or family, I #8217;m not in a mindset where I feel vulnerable or anxious because of my altered state. I just act like I always have, and maybe even do it better because I #8217;m loosened up by the pot. Weed doesn #8217;t change you; it enhances you (to an extent) I used to get anxious no matter what I smoked, where I smoked, or who I smoked with. You just have to get out of your head, believe me. It #8217;s not easy, but it #8217;s possible  #129305; #127995;</TEXT>

Keep in mind the EGCG is needed with both for max absorption. As for a vitamin complex and minerals, vitamin B6 may do a little to maximize 5-HTP conversion, but I #8217;m not sure. Keep taking them for sure, they won #8217;t do any harm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. Every sliver of doubt is gone. Breeders are fucking inherently terrible people and that #8217;s all there is to it.

Rape and childbirth are the two worst things I can think of, and she combines both of them into some fantasy so you and more, one again, non consenting children can suffer. By the way, love your cat unconditionally. It deserves it much more than humans do. This post have proven that to me. Oh, and fuck your sister (no offense towards you).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Water is good. Water is great. It is L I F E HOWEVER! You can always have too much of anything, whether it be oxygen, exercise, or water. In addition to hurting your tummy and making you feel bloated, drinking an excess of water in a short amount of time (I.E one liter/one hour - 27-33 oz/one hour) can lead to a serious and sometimes fatal condition known as **hyponatremia**. Stay hydrated, and keep on sipping that clear, liquid crystal gift from the heavens, but sip in moderation! Over hydration isn #8217;t only unnecessary and painful, but it can be devastatingly harmful as well. Stay thirsty, my friends. But not too thirsty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since you #8217;re exerting yourself and probably sweating, it could be a little worse, actually. I #8217;m guessing you understand that sweat is composed of more than just water. The consumption of just water without any salts can and will reduce your sodium levels dramatically, which will lead to hyponatremia and eventually, coma or death. The way to get around this is to either drink an electrolyte solution. Perhaps make your own instead of grabbing a bottle of Gatorade, but in a pinch it #8217;s not a bad alternatives. Both of those options are going to be a lot more hydrating, and won #8217;t cause you to step over the line of water intoxication.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sure. I was in a relationship with this girl a little after I moved in, and oh my god he hated her. He made it obvious everyday how great it would be if I broke up with her, which I eventually did for reasons unrelated to him. After the break up, that #8217;s when the boundaries really went out the window. I really, REALLY have to try hard and pretend like I #8217;m not totally creeped out by his advances (I #8217;d rather not elaborate). It #8217;s not even the fact that it #8217;s him. I #8217;ve been hit on by dudes before, and as disdainful I am towards the idea, he just acts like this is a totally normal thing to me. As soon as I move out of here, I #8217;m gonna be a total man-whore just to spite him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did before anything even happened, and after. The last time I even made mention of possibly being the slightest bit uncomfortable, he literally spent the whole rest of the day muttering to himself how terrible of a person he is. He #8217;s literally the most self deprecating, self centered, pity seeking guy I know, and I wouldn #8217;t wish him on my worst enemy. He #8217;s a different kind of crazy. You can #8217;t talk to him about anything that he does in a negative way. He just can #8217;t deal with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had guys try to do stuff with me, but I either politely reject them or show obvious disinterest. He #8217;s tried things, believe me. I allow him a degree of affection, because of his delusion and it really just makes a smoother road in the long run. Luckily he #8217;s not a super sexual person, he #8217;s just really touchy and has attachment problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I absolutely agree with you on everything you #8217;ve said. Despite his extreme aversion to criticisms and rejection, I will start being more assertive with him. I #8217;m not totally powerless, which you #8217;ve all helped me realize. His family had told me before that he can make himself believe in completely irrational things, and he really does put his own needs before anyone else #8217;s. I guess that while we were friends, I thought he and I had developed a level of trust and understanding. He really has a power complex nowadays, and it shows in every aspect of his life. Thank you for the kind words and support. It means a ton, and I wish you and your SO the best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that and even considered using an alternate account, but he never uses Reddit because he thinks it #8217;s stupid (TikTok addict) and even then, a huge reality check for him. I feel like if he truly cared about me as a person, he wouldn #8217;t be pulling this shit in the first place. Whether or not he finds my post before or after I move out or even at all, it #8217;s the same outcome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I didn #8217;t want people to think I was gay, I wouldn #8217;t have made this post. I said that without being me, it #8217;s pretty much impossible to understand my point of view in this situation. I didn #8217;t make this post because I #8217;m upset that my pretend boyfriend isn #8217;t good to me, it #8217;s because I #8217;m upset that I trusted this guy for years and the second that he has me alone in his own place, he sees it as an invitation to steal my life and personality away. He #8217;s lost all respect for me and my boundaries, so technically I guess I am  #8220;trying #8221; something, just against my will. And yes, it #8217;s going poorly. I #8217;ve gotten kind of tired of constantly being wrong though, so if you want to read my post again and actually read the words instead of just judging me on the first sentence, go ahead.</TEXT>

Thank you for the kind words man, I #8217;ve started to feel a little bit stupid and even crazy myself over the past few months. I know it #8217;s not my own thinking; I was one of the most overconfident, happiest people before I moved out, and I know fully well what I #8217;m capable of. Just sucks that a great friend of mine has become my least favorite person in the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My approach to life has been confusing and unusual as long as I can remember. I will admit I do things impulsively and get myself into shit without thinking things through, but this is someone I trusted. I only bring up the Tinder thing and stuff, because it #8217;s obvious he #8217;s only using this dating ploy that he probably knows deep down I #8217;m not into as a way to keep me from being the straight guy that I am. If he was okay with us being platonic, he wouldn #8217;t have to force labels and shit on me. If he actually thought of me as a  #8220;boyfriend #8221;, he #8217;d respect my boundaries and respect me as a person. I honestly don #8217;t even know where I stand in this  #8220;relationship #8221;, I #8217;ve honestly just gotten to the point where I agree and nod my head to his stupid allegations, because any sign of me not instantly agreeing is grounds for him completely exploding on me and making the rest of the day extremely uncomfortable. It #8217;s like having a tumor that I can #8217;t remove without dying. I just have to wait for the right time to cut it off and move on with my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He is definitely not joking. His advances and creepy behavior is totally intentional, and he #8217;s crossed many lines that friends just don #8217;t cross. I can #8217;t act uncomfortable or resist though, I #8217;ve already gotten myself far enough into this bullshit that if I try to get out, he #8217;ll see it as me just dropping him  #8220;like everyone else has #8221;. Exactly his words. Each and every friend, boyfriend, and family member he #8217;s pushed away and ruined his relationship with. And now he #8217;s doing it to me, the one person he promised not to do it to. If I really did care about this dude at all anymore, I #8217;d probably stand up for myself and try to fix things, but I just don #8217;t give a shit about him or whatever future we could have. I #8217;d really rather just have him disappear from my life altogether.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do we know that Garfield isn #8217;t an eternal entity, bound to the ancient fabric of space and time from the time it had started spreading to the present? A universal parasite, capable of controlling entire galaxies through a brutal, ruthless symbiotic process. However, he chooses only to possess Jon. Why is this? It may contain sacred, previously unknown knowledge that the host can not grow on its own simply by gaining control over a super massive, galactic body. Maybe the simple, insignificant vessel that Jon inhabits is the perfect host body... an unnoticed, imperfect organism, whose life and death has little to no impact on the outcome of humanity. Perhaps he chooses to be forgotten, or is simply gathering power, posing as a simple house cat. Once his already unspeakable influence on our universe has reached max capacity, we may find out... for now, all we can do is live in fear, or denial. No in between. The inevitable has started, and it #8217;s end is only coming closer with each second. Our judgment day has finally arrived. It is up to us to accept, or surrender. Both will lead to our demise.</TEXT>

Thus, I #8217;m no longer a teenager and have graduated to the status of full on  #8220;adult #8221;, and for whatever else I #8217;d call myself, I don #8217;t know. Thing is, it #8217;s time I #8217;ve taken my leave. Despite being with this sub for only a short time, it was a laid back, comfy place to come chill and made me realize that not all teenagers are the stupid morons that I #8217;ve associated with over the years. Thank you for the laughs and the sincere feeling of involvement. Y #8217;all are a big, imperfectly perfect pack of hooligans and it #8217;s been a blast. My advice for y #8217;all: drugs aren #8217;t worth it, don #8217;t procrastinate, and embrace the teen years. You only have a few, and they go by quickly.

There was this annoying buzz the entire time that was loud and always present, along with a heavy feeling along with the frying. Other side effects were complete loss of feeling in my legs, puking, and pupil dilation. It could just be me. Delsym and Robo gels, on the other hand, brought great euphoria and amazing CEV #8217;s. I very well could be allergic to CPM.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh. I got a lot of fun stuff. The most unstable emotional makeup, ridiculously easily triggered anxiety that often results in brief periods of extreme self deprecation and insecurity. Not for any reason, either. I could be fine one second, but as soon I #8217;m slightly inconvenienced or upset, my emotions decide it #8217;s time to go into overdrive. Makes it really hard to make rational decisions, ever. And I can barely drive because of it, whereas most people think I #8217;m just stupid and can #8217;t control a car. I #8217;m really just trying not to hurt anyone, but until I have my license it #8217;s impossible to not drive without getting berated. Also goes for literally anything I do.  #8220;Just let me do it, you #8217;ll mess it up. #8221; That #8217;s all I fucking hear. I #8217;m slightly less skilled than the regular person, and that #8217;s just not okay. Can you live my life for me too? Obviously I #8217;m messing that up too. Having bad hearing, shitty vision and fucked up coordination is definitely my fault. It #8217;s like living in a shitty, staticky sitcom where the main character is universally hated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s human nature to spread sadness and discomfort in any form. Sure, I spend 90% of my waking life wishing I was asleep, dead, or just focusing on of the many physical/mental ailments that make everyday just so great. That #8217;s why I #8217;ve given up on being selfless or anything. Just use and fuck up what you #8217;ve got; life is too unforgiving and short for you to waste time caring. We won #8217;t get anything out of being a good person, anyway. Either way, we #8217;ll end up forgotten within less than a century.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m so upset that I #8217;m not causing anymore suffering on this desolate planet. My children are missing out on... so much. They #8217;ll never get to experience sadness, anxiety, fear, pain, having to work their whole life, missed opportunities, sickness, constant societal stress, school related stress, financial stress, mental and physical ailments, insecurity, nausea, and just the pain of being alive in general? That sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Slightly higher prices, around $120-$140 for an ounce of their top shelf stuff. I got some Black Diamond OG that was possibly the strongest pot I #8217;ve smoked, really uniform, smooth, super dense nugs with no seeds or stems. It #8217;s way more reliable than my dealer at the same prices, and a lot higher quality and consistency than other dispensaries in my area. Their extracts and concentrates are nothing special, but go for very reasonable prices. Dab and oil carts are decent, but the syringe oil I picked up is pretty potent. For stuff like live resin or THC-A crystals, there #8217;s not as much selection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I puked on almost every drug I've done, from DXM to opiates to cannabis to LSD. However, these feel like a cleansing, detoxifying experience and end up making me feel so much better. Every time I puked drunk, I would get sicker and feel worse as if I went into hangover automatically. The feeling I get from abstaining from my decade long cannabis habit is simply a sobriety. The day after drinking is a withdrawal like hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The function of GABA in the brain is to reduce stress, and generally is associated with feelings or relaxation and drowsiness. An excessive amount would presumably cause the opposite of a deficiency; low alertness and a less severe reaction to stimulus. I can #8217;t find a specific source stating this, but it is only a hypothesis based on my own experience. Phenibut doses of 3g+ caused me to be horrendously socially impaired, stuttering and slurring my words. However, I didn #8217;t notice and felt at full capacity. This is certainly a case of mental detachment/diggin was as I was completely unaware of my impairment, and felt the opposite during the  #8220;hangover #8221; stage of the drug.

    <TITLE>Interesting effect from cocoa/coffee</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-16 18:15:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the past five days, I #8217;ve been experimenting with a mix of instant coffee and unsweetened cocoa powder. It is presumably a mix of organic and Dutched cocoa, not raw cacao. This was a personal mistake I made when purchasing these products but it seems to not be an issue. However, I get an unexpected effect from the combination. A decently strong cup of coffee with two or more tablespoons of cocoa causes a mildly sedating, almost euphoric feeling followed by a somewhat hypomanic state of physical energy and sociability. These experiences last all day especially with a second cup consumed. So far, no tolerance has been perceived. Is this just a rush of endorphins and serotonin due to the cocoa, followed by an excess of dopamine possibly caused by the caffeine and theobromine present? It #8217;s a great combination but I don #8217;t want to overuse it and lose the motivational effects. Thanks for any insight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After a dose of 3 tablespoons added to a regular strength coffee, along with some butter and milk, it was nearly putting me to sleep! Mentally, it was a very relaxed tranquility and I could see it being an issue if a higher dose is used in the morning for waking up. However, it is most definitely mildly euphoric when used for chilling out. The most recreational effect I feel is after the initial sedative state, is throwing in a slightly vigorous workout with a rich meal, and if you indulge, perhaps a smal amount of weed. Even with or without cannabis, the resulting feeling is a pleasurable but natural "zen" state of rewarding. A little bit of work of course but there is no discernible crash and is by far the cleanest boost out there. Play around with ratios and fats/oils and let me know your results!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not at all. Mine is a baking cocoa which works fine, I can't recall the exact brand but I recommend searching up unroasted, raw CACAO (not cocoa). Same stuff, but the unroasted contains more of the energy boosting fats and cognitive enhancing alkaloids. If you are worried about taste, add some sugar or milk. There is no reason to use baking cocoa, that is a mistake of mine. Any organic, fair-trade certified cacao should work just fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Negative side effects are pretty minimal with this combo, but a little too much caffeine plus cocoa can cause a heart pounding sensation. This only happens during the sedating onset, strangely enough. Besides that, sweating and stomach discomfort from an empty stomach are the only other negatives I've experienced. Plenty of water will counteract tension related pains, as well, and as a diuretic combo I can't stress adequate intake importance enough. As for the fats, they are less important but coconut oil and MTC oil are great products for smoothing out and extending the energy provided by the caffeine and theobromine. I believe that the theory is a high amount of calories from fat causes a ketosis like reaction, burning energy slowly and sustaining it rather than going through it all at once. That all being said, cacao/cocoa and coffee is a potentially anxious mix, especially to those sensitive to caffeine. L-theanine and Ashwaghanda have seemed to help in that aspect. All the best :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cacao is the preferred product here, as it contains a ton of flavanols and antioxidants that are known for increasing cognitive function. It's also a healthier stimulation than straight caffeine, and can positively affect blood pressure as well. Not only is cacao extremely nutritious and healthy for the body, but it is a wonderful cerebral booster and provides plenty of beneficial fats and antioxidants. Cocoa and cacao both, but raw cacao will always have more nootropical benefits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To start, I am a 20 year old male with rather severe ADHD and a slight case of autism. All the following noots and substances nearly completely negate my mental noise and distractions. **DAILY** I generally take generic caffeine, 400-600mg a day along with 600-800mg Suntheanine L-Theanine respectively to start my day. The focus and mood boosting effects of caffeine are boosted, while the peripheral side effects (sweating, increased BP and HR, involuntary movements) are all taken away. I also take Nature's Bounty Zinc 50mg twice daily, once for a massive morning boost that never fails along with a nightly dose for better sleep that helps with T production and muscle regeneration. I will soon be adding (undecided brand) 500mg Magnesium into this. It acts as a natural relaxant and totally cuts out depression from the mind. Finally, I take ground root ashwaghanda from Jarrow. So far, it has only slightly decreased my general anxiety and may have caused minor depression, so I will be cutting this supplement and thus don't think displaying dosage is necessary **CYCLES** For cycling supplements, I enjoy Jarrow's Rhodiola 500mg three times a day for it's ability to severely cut down on autism related over thinking and overcomplicating, the increased stress resistance and indirect body relaxation. I never take Rhodiola more than four or five days in a row. For when I need to kick into high gear and really have a productive day, I will take Jarrow's L-Tyrosine 1g three times on that one day. It absolutely puts me into work mode, where I will get irritable if I don't have a task at hand. This is strictly occasional and often only for one or two days max, as it leads to a more pronounced crash after work and causes snappiness, fidgeting and clumsiness in excess. Combine with caffeine one hour after dosing on an empty stomach for most effectiveness. An overall review of my general well-being and differences in my pre-noot self are anything but subtle. After a reasonable period of Mag/Z supplementation, my voice noticeably lowers in pitch, and doesn't crack whatsoever. Body pains reduced, muscle aches taken away. Hypersensitivity from autism is greatly decreased, making rough clothes and bedding material not unbearable. Anxiety is also taken away along with relieving depression. As for acute, day-to-day notable differences are just a general increase in motivation due to caffeine, and stuttering is almost non-existent when paired with L-theanine, an essential secondary. Hypomania may occur if sleep deprivation is present, but can be almost a productive state if not continued for too long. No side effects have cropped up from this combo, and it has been my longest lasting stack, going on nearly *three years* and not having to take insane doses of either. My future supplement plans are, excluding brands: Lion's Mane for memory repair NAC for OCD and anxiety related issues Lithium Orotate for same reason Creatine for boosting gains and energy Cordyceps for more T Taurine for anxiety and heart arrhythmia Good brands seem to be Jarrow, Nature's Bounty, NOW and Doctor's Best. Stay away from Spring Valley and store generic brands when speaking of herbs and unregulated herbal "patents". PM me if you have any specific questions and let me know if this helped at all!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Serious heart valve damage when not taken with EGCG (green tea extract), due to 5-HTP's inability to convert to usable serotonin in the brain without pairing it with this chemical. It will also cause an inevitable, noticeable drop in dopamine levels due to using the same inhibition enzyme (AAAD) causing them to compete. Since Tyrosine is still being inhibited but not supplemented, it will tank. These side effects can be reduced, of course, though you may have to cycle due to the stubborn properties of these transmitters. [Enzyme Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415362/#__sec4title) [Heart Valve Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1850922/) While safer than other SSRI's/SRI's, it is not without risk and the risks are not common knowledge. Besides that, doses of 300mg and higher tend to make me sweat excessively, vomit, and shake uncontrollably. It is by no means benign; just be safe and don't continue if it causes nausea consistently.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anything to add to this stack?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-07 16:14:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, I've recently started involving myself with nootropics, specifically those that help with ADHD/OCD/Autism symptoms (i.e. over thinking everything, ruminating, emotional sensitivity, anxiety) My current daily "stack" is as follows: Caffeine 200-600mg Creatine 5g Magnesium Aspartate 900mg Zinc Aspartate 60mg Explosive exercise 3-5 days a week To start, caffeine and creatine both seem to aid in physical fatigue and are very effective in increasing my reps/weight/intensity in my workouts. No complaints about tiredness or lack of stamina, but wouldn't mind more energy. I will be adding taurine to reduce cardiovascular side effects, as l-theanine did quite the opposite when combined with caffeine. As far as I know, the zinc and magnesium combo has greatly improved my sleep quality and sustains me physically throughout the day. To put it simply, my issues do not lie in my physical abilities, but rather my talkative brain. Other supplements I've tried include: Lion's Mane, made me feel depressed Ashwaghanda, made me depressed and angry L-Tyrosine, good for a one day boost but leads to depressive crash Rhodiola, may try again due to lack of effects caused by a shoddy brand 5-HTP, did nothing except possibly aggravate existing palpitations due to ignorance of inevitable heart valve damage, along with nausea and bloating Some ideas I have are trying ALCAR with ALA, along with perhaps Rhodiola Rosea and Inositol as I've read this stack helps with verbal fluency, general anxiety and prevents/reverses deterioration of the myelin sheath as well. My options are limited to stores as I can't order anything online right now due to personal reasons. I'm willing to try most supplements that aren't related to GABAergics or SSRI's, such as Phenibut or Tryptophan. I'm fine with anything that helps regulate GABA or reduce glutamate, but no direct agonists as I like those too much. What I'm mostly trying to accomplish is a reduction in random, anxious thoughts and constant ruminating or obsessing over pointless, trivial matters. I am very clumsy as well, usually at my worst when trying to fix something I broke because of said clumsiness; ironic but also extremely frustrating. I've had issues with clumsiness and distracting, loud thoughts my whole life and are about the only deficit nowadays. With better mental function, I imagine my physical will improve as well. Thanks for any suggestions, and let me know if I should clear up any points I made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For any herbal supplement, isolated dosing is always the best route to take. Trying to figure out what herb is doing what while you're taking even two or more is a pain in the ass, along with any possible interactions. Ash made me feel depressed, but Rhodiola really clears my mind in a subtle but appreciative way. I drop things less, speak more fluently. Try Rhodiola first, drop it after two weeks and do the same with Ash. If you like how both work, take 'em together. Those two should have no harmful interactions.</TEXT>

It #8217;s all so great that I get up everyday just to experience it only to fall asleep once the day becomes too much for me, and then waking up to go feel it all again.

My muscles and joints seem to be working much more smoothly, running up stairs is effortless and no amount of lifting causes long lasting soreness aside from recovering from a heavy workout.

    <TEXT>A huge toss up between caffeine and NAC for me. If you #8217;d like to see them as a synergistic combo, as I do, you #8217;ll understand. Verbal fluency has been an issue my entire life. I can know exactly what I want to say, rehearse it countless times, only to switch around letters or entire words and just completely muck up the sentence to where it doesn #8217;t sound like English. Amusing to others, embarrassing and frustrating to me. My self-esteem was actually lowered severely because I just couldn #8217;t talk without tripping over my words. Caffeine helped initially, but I still had issues forming words quickly and usually my brain was working ahead of my mouth causing me to seem strung out which wasn #8217;t helpful. This was a major downside as my social anxiety was so low, but after stuttering it started to rise and the caffeine began to become an anxiogenic rather than its usual anxiolytic effect. After reading about NAC, I started trying it at three grams a day, and it took around two weeks but I #8217;m starting to see change. Yesterday I talked so fast and so fluently, it was like magic. My words had separation but we #8217;re all connected, without feeling like I have a massive swollen tongue in the way. My thoughts have this  #8220;chute #8221; effect where they don #8217;t have to go through a filter of some kind or be processed, I just know what I want to say and I say it effortlessly. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, I can only imagine I had some brain inflammation as Advil also helped with this issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Strong sativa micro doses combined with caffeine feel like a less manic amphetamine for me. Low grade, but non distracting euphoria, and a reduction in bodily stress and general anxiety without turning my muscles into concrete. It usually takes around a 10mg sativa edible, or a one second pull off a vape pen. My cannabis tolerance is rather high, so I #8217;d stick to vapes until edibles are a safe option. For some people, 10mg could make them unable to be productive. It just increases my sociability and wellbeing without feeling unnatural or making me too tired/stimulated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is absolutely the biggest struggle I have in life, is my verbal fluency and recall. It #8217;s astonishing how different the vocabulary and structuring of my sentences when going from writing/texting to speaking are. Sometimes I feel downright stupid for having to feel my way through everything I say like an obstacle course, yet have a perfectly clear idea of what I wanted to say that just decided to disappear when my mouth opened. I #8217;ve noticed that caffeine helps in the regard of being able to talk a little more fluently, along with creatine and a semi-keto diet helping a ton. I just avoid carbs in general. NAC started to help after about two weeks, and I could tell it started working recently, because the other day I was able to point something out to someone in such a quick and cohesive way that I surprised myself. Not one word was mispronounced, not one pause, I spoke super quick and fluently without sounding like I was on speed. Because of where I work, I need to be able to communicate well to advance. Black seed oil has helped as well, and I plan to start on other things people post on here. Thanks for the question! !Remindme 1 day</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since highaf94 decided to be condescending and unhelpful, I can try and help. My best motivation nootropics have honestly been workout supps. Caffeine is a big obvious, but if you don #8217;t want to rely on it, then I think other stuff that #8217;s not as habitual could help. Creatine gives me a physical energy boost that doesn #8217;t feel unnatural, I simply feel stronger which helps push through tasks. Citrulline and beta-alanine have a similar effect, and all seem to synergistically work together to wipe away fatigue. Mental motivation is a harder one, but black seed oil and fish oil from natural sources seems to cut out my brain fog and anxiety issues which kill motivation. Boron and zinc should help too, especially if you #8217;re a male, along with magnesium and D3. My intake looks like this: Black seed oil/Hemp seed oil 3 tsp/a day Magnesium Taurate 900mg Zinc Picolinate 50mg Copper, Manganese, Molybdenum complex L-citrulline 3g Beta-alanine 3.2g Creatine 3g Caffeine 325mg Boron 5mg These supplements can increase testosterone as far as I know, so be careful if you start to experience irritation if you try this stack. It #8217;s non traditional, but regular nootropics seem to not work for me. It helps me :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rhodiola acts in certain ways based on dose. Personally, an extract of any percentage of rosavins, when taken at a dose of 350-500mg cause a subtle stimulation for me that feels more physical and can help with the mental scattering effect of caffeine as it seems to smooth that side effect out. Doses from 1000mg+ cause increasing levels of sedation, making my body feel rather heavy and can even counteract other stimulants. If you want to use it for sleep, I recommend higher doses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey fellas, I get a weird effect from weed that I've experienced every time I smoke enough that never fails despite tolerance. Once it really sets in and the high begins to plateau, this psychadelic sort of pattern or filter spans across my vision. It's like a transparent screen that doesn't exist in any specific object or point in my vision, just a slightly shifting full screen filter that always resembles a geometric tapestry or something. Mostly noticeable with white backgrounds, does anyone else get this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No side effects as far as I can tell. It #8217;s a good stack for vascular health, i.e exercise/erections. If you have hypotension it could possibly exacerbate that but it would take many different vasodilators to risk that. Throw methylcobolamin and methylfolate in there for additional BP improvements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I take absolutely no prescription medications, but I have taken the supplements you list and can offer my anecdotal experiences. From what I can tell, you #8217;re taking an antidepressant (MAOI) and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) which, through my personal research, leads me to believe this is causing a drop in your libido and ultimately is the ED culprit. You seemed to already have figured this out, however. I wouldn #8217;t recommend adding in anything that alters serotonin at this point, considering your antidepressant lineup. Instead, look for l-arginine/l-citrulline stacks, since these two have synergy and should bolster the vasodilation effects. A dose of 3g/3g twice a day shows visual effects for me, and undeniable results. However, it is ill-advised to combine too many vasodilators with something like clonidine, as they can dangerously lower blood pressure when taken together. In order to avoid this potential issue, or if this side effect is noted, more expensive supplements such as Tongkat Ali or even a zinc supplement can strengthen libido without risk. Keep the arginine for now, however, and try the citrulline with it to gauge effectiveness. Magnesium glycinate is an effective magnesium supplement in terms of absorption and intended effects. The glycine amino acid is a relaxant in itself, and can raise serotonin levels which further stresses the point of avoiding any 5HT2 modulators. However, both the amino acid and mineral will relax the skeletal muscles, mitigating pain. Glycine is effective at inhibiting over arousal, along with magnesium #8217;s calming action on the CNS. A standard dose for your purposes comes to around 800mg/day. This should not result in GI issues, and should be split into an AM and PM dose (1:3) for max effectiveness. L-Tyrosine and hypertension should not be a concern to you, especially with your use of clonidine and arginine. Standard doses range from 1.5g-3g, taken in the morning, or after the effects of any dopamine-sapping substances wear off. NALT (N-acetyl l-tyrosine) appears to cross the BBB more readily, which would help with your case. However, assess the effectiveness of regular tyrosine, first. Lastly, NAC used in the treatment of OCD has been shown to be effective at 2.4g-3g/day. This can be split into two doses, or an extended release version could be used. Sorry for the long post, but I prefer to be thorough instead of just list numbers. TL;DR Tyrosine/NALT - 1.5g-3g as needed NAC - 2.4g-3g/day Magnesium Glycinate - 800mg/day Citrulline/Arginine - 3g:3g/day.</TEXT>
