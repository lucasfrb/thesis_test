    <TEXT>Holy crud, thank you!! I have the Freedom app installed as of now, and I hope that'll help with my focus. As for returning to school, I don't trust the authorities anymore and the district is crap so that's a no. But I'll try that studying method, I know that it's definitely going to work for me! THANK YOU!! :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do the scars ever fade?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-17 07:18:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;m pretty young (early teens), and I #8217;m about two months clean at the moment, which I #8217;m very proud of. I only have a few cuts to my name, but I guess it counts for something, ey? Since my parents found out, I #8217;ve been applying Vitamin E to not just my self harm scars, but my cat scratches as well. Now the scratches and cuts I #8217;ve disguised as scratches, I could care less about. But it #8217;s the horizontal ones I #8217;m worried about. I mostly have shallow scars, but I have a deeper cut that sits on my left wrist. And not gonna lie, I hate all of them. I just want them to go away. I don #8217;t want them to haunt me all throughout my life. I WANT to be able to wear short sleeves. I WANT to be able to proudly display my wrists in public and NOT have people stare at me with pity or disgust. I just want my normal, scar-free skin back. I can reduce the appearance with creams and oils, but my question is, do the scars ever fully disappear?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My father is a homophobe.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-19 05:52:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have no idea where to post this, so I guess I #8217;ll throw this here. So I #8217;m VERY pansexual, and will proudly say so to whoever asks. I love the fact that I #8217;m not the only person who identifies as something other than heterosexual, and have joined so many communities on my main account pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community. Problem is, I #8217;m terrified of my CHRISTIAN parents finding out. My mother? She #8217;s neutral on the topic. She #8217;s told me flat-out that she #8217;d be okay if I came out as bi or lesbian, or whatever I want to become (though she #8217;s stressed to me that she wants me to stay her  #8220;sweet daughter #8221; and not her son), she just won #8217;t come to my wedding if I do. Sucks, but it makes sense. But my father? Hell no. He actively talks about how going homo is wrong, and how gays should not exist. He tried teaching me at a young age that  #8220;gays are bad #8221;, and even tried to teach me this little chant of  #8220;Gay is not the way! Don #8217;t be gay! #8221; Though obviously, that backfired. :) But still, it hurts that the very thing I love and support, is the thing my father wants to kill off and destroy. I have a rocky relationship with him, but I still love him. I think that if I tell him, I #8217;ll drive that wedge even deeper and I #8217;ll completely lose his respect. And I #8217;m scared. I #8217;m sorry, I just want to get this off my chest.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-01 08:36:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don #8217;t want to keep going. What #8217;s the point if all we #8217;re gonna do in life is work minimum wage jobs, just barely making ends meet with no money to spare? I #8217;m not gonna do anything special in my life, and even if I do, I #8217;ll still be forgotten in time. I feel like everything #8217;s crashing down on me. My friends have stopped talking to me, because I #8217;m attending online school I hardly ever get human interaction (parents don #8217;t count), I #8217;ve been having a tough time with school, I feel like everyone #8217;s learning to hate me... The only people who #8217;ll miss me are my parents and other relatives like my cousin (she #8217;s one of my MAIN reasons, actually). I #8217;ve been trying to give myself reasons not to do it, but lately, those aren #8217;t working. The only reasons I haven #8217;t already done it is because of my family, my cousin, and the thought that if I fail, I #8217;ll lose any chance of going into the federal line of work. But it #8217;s becoming harder and harder to live with my pain, and I just want it to STOP. I just want everything to stop. Fuck living, I give up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Y #8217;know, it #8217;s shit like this that pisses me off. 10 year old Gachatards and other people like this romanticize depression and self-harm and paint it into some fucking trendy thing. So now, people like me who are ACTUALLY suffering from mental illnesses and those who turn to self-harm are considered  #8220;attention seekers #8221; or  #8220;fakers #8221; for reaching out. Yeah, I may be overreacting, but it pisses me off to no end to see people glorify self-harm like this. I #8217;m struggling with self-harm, I #8217;m not even an hour clean. And it just hurts to know that I can #8217;t reach out to others lest I be called an attention seeker. Sorry for wasting 10-20 seconds of your time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hah, something similar happened to me around 3-4 years ago. Was at a playground with the neighbor #8217;s kids (we were there to screw around, not to actually use the equipment), and I was sitting on the bars of one of the structures. Somehow, I slipped and plummeted into the wood chips. I had pierced my bottom lip all the way through, I could literally stick my nail into it. Blood got everywhere, and I had to sprint home to get it taken care of. I still have the scar to date. It #8217;s not noticeable anymore, but it serves as a fun story to tell when trying to break the ice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do it for a multitude of reasons, but my main thing is that self-harm reminds me that I am a real person with a body and feelings, and not just some computer program or advanced AI. ~~Also, I just wanted to clarify, it would be very difficult for someone who self-harms to  #8220;stop immediately #8221;, though I really wish that that #8217;s how it works. I understand that you had good intentions behind it, I #8217;m just saying. Unless someone #8217;s scarring their skin for the trend (which I find very unlikely), I don #8217;t think someone is going to stop just because someone tells them to  #8220;stop cutting #8221; and  #8220;be happy #8221;~~ Sorry for the rant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Self-harm is when someone deliberately does something to hurt themselves. This behavior usually presents itself in the form of cutting, burning, or scratching, but anything can be considered self-harm when they do something with the intent of mentally or physically hurting themselves. With this information, you can try to figure out if this woman was trying to hurt herself or if it was just some sort of ideal look she was going for. How do I know all this? Well, I #8217;m a professional self-harmer! Heh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, I #8217;ll say this now: our interactions had never become even remotely sexual. I #8217;m not interested in the act, nor anything that goes along with it. However, I understand what you mean, and I #8217;ll try. I #8217;ve woven myself too far into this web, and I #8217;m not the strongest person mentally to be able to break myself free of it. I mentioned it in my post, but Q went through some mental problems with a girl and I ended up becoming her replacement. He has an emotional attachment to me, and I know that if I cut ties with him, it #8217;ll properly mess him up. I know I shouldn #8217;t be worried about someone you call a pedophile, but I #8217;d feel way too guilty about doing it. Hell, I still feel guilty about slamming the door to my room back when I was 8! Also, my parents are out of the question. I #8217;d basically lose a friendship with my father if I do. Despite my negative reply, I #8217;ll try taking your advice. Maybe not the whole  #8220;avoid all future contact #8221; thing, but I #8217;ll at least try to end the relationship. This comment helped me a lot, thanks. ^ - ^</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be totally honest, I just slap on a bandaid. If my yeets cover a large surface, I #8217;ll add a gauze pad and then put on a large bandaid. I didn #8217;t know hat there were other ways of caring for cuts until recently. I believe that there was a master post on caring for cuts. If I find it, I #8217;ll reply to my comment with the link. From what I remember, start by wiping away the blood with a cloth or a rag. Toilet paper or tissues are alright in shallower yeets, however, it #8217;s more risky to use them on deeper yeets, as debris can get into the wound and cause an infection. (I believe that the guide also said it was alright to run it under water? I #8217;ll get back to you on that... ^ ^  #8220;) Then, take some triple antibiotic cream (like Neosporin) and apply it to the area. If it #8217;s shallow, then you can apply it straight on. For fat yeets and deeper, add it around the edges of the wound. Place something over it to absorb any blood that continues to seep from the wound. For example, a gauze pad. Finally, apply the dressing. Like I said earlier, I just slap a bandaid over mine once I finish, but you can also use medical tape to secure the gauze pad, or a medical dressing to keep the wound clean and safe. I #8217;ll take this down if I #8217;m wrong. I #8217;ve just recently been doing this, but I haven #8217;t had any issues with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, that'd be considered self-destructive behaviour. Most people who starve themselves are trying to lose weight, they're likely not doing it to relieve their emotional pain or gain some sort of control in their lives. Sure, people can intentionally harm themselves without realizing it (I.E. biting their nails), but unless one is intentionally starving themselves as a way to hurt themselves, then it's NOT self-harm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, wooo!!! I won #8217;t have to deal with local anesthesia! :D Second... I #8217;ll take a look at the remedies you suggested. Maybe they #8217;ll help! Though, I #8217;m not exactly facing a lot of pain. It #8216;s more so just pain from the pressure. And finally... Thanks for letting me know! That was the main thing I was worried about. I feel a little better about this whole thing now. Thanks for the help!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hello, I #8217;m 14F and I want to get into volleyball if/when school opens back up. I have a concern, though... Would regular-length volleyball shorts cover down to this area on my thighs? Check my post history if you want to know the reason.</TITLE>
