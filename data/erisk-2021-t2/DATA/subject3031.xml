    <TEXT>Ok, first of the the sf haters, this hero requires skills beyond ordinary heroes far surpassing heroes like storm prenerf. This hero was perfectly fine for so many patches without any nerfs. Why nerd sf when you can buff other heroes which seen viable. Sf is balanced its just other heroes that were viable that WERE/ARE good against sf are played. Therefore, icefrog don't kill this poor multisoul hero.:)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Item tradeability</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-05 21:56:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as most of know, there are some items/sets and so forth that are not tradeable and not giftable. I feel that, that is unfair. We paid for these pixels on our screens, we deserve to be able to trade/sell them on the market and gift them to friends. I am wondering two things. First thing is do you guys agree that these items should all be tradable? The second thing is, could we potentially convince Valve to make them tradable? The items I'm mainly referring to are the ti5 cache, and some of the Frankfurt major sets, but this applies to all kinds of sets(that are not tradeable). TLDR: Should all items be made tradeable, even the ones that aren't tradeable now?? Edit 1: This post's purpose was just to shed some light on this topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I propose two ideas, in one. Valve should add a new report catergory labeled as "lack of a universal language," this is in itself has pros and cons. A pro would be it would punish players, that put English as their main language, but spam their own language in chat. A con is this can, and most likely would be abused for a mulitude of reasons. However, as I see it now, it could work. As much as I'am against region blocks, maybe a region block would be a sufficent punishment, similar to low priority. Except it would be time based.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I would be all for the idea. However, there is a reason it is was made available during the time period of the battlepass. That being, that it could turn cancerous, people always wanting to be on top, and winning everytime. Then there could be people, talking about how tryhard, those people are. Plus, it would get boring, become lackluster. This way if it is made exculsive people will crave and would be more excited when they finally got to play it after a while.</TEXT>

Scalable UI size as the new UI itself is small, and it's hard for my eyes to focus when its small. It's like a fly, that is flying around your room, it's annoying. But something bigger like a dog, isn't. Bad comparison, but hopefully you guys understand what I mean. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I have not finished the anime , yet I'm on episode 20 and I've been to pace myself since each episode is intense. However, my questions are Will there be a anime related to akame ga kill (prequel like akame ga kill zero, or a sequel or remake) planned to be or is currently being planned to be released in the future? Second question, so I know about the manga and how it continues from chapter 39, but I have never read manga before. Is it easy to get into, as it is in black and white and not animated ofc? Thanks in advance! Edit 1: Forgot one question, is there any anime that is similar to Akame Ga Kill?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only thing that would kid solve this issue partially was if you had to recalibrate your mmr every (given time frame). This would create a more accurate mmr system, as 1). It would incentivize to play to improve, so if someone is not happy with the mmr he/she got he/she can improve and wait for the next recalibration. 2). If you had to recalibrate your mmr every so often, this would surely lower the amount of account buyers. As there mmr is heavily inflated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My thoughts so far (just finished episode 18)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-22 05:38:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Disclaimer I'm just throwing really unlikely ideas out there to see how close/far off I was. Since I have like 9 episodes left. I thought it would be something cool to look back on. I am really enjoying this series can't wait to finish it, and prepare for season 2!! I do have a couple of remarks, I want to see how close I am to predicting what happens (a reference for me). So my thoughts on why commander Erwin brought everyone into the forest and lured the female colossus titan was that he wanted to kill off Eren. Possibly because he knows something about the titans or maybe even works with them.(?) Therefore, he doesn't want a threat to the titans to exist and wants to kill Eren off as quickly as possible. Then the secret of the titans, I think that the colossus titans are some sort of "mad scientists" that allowed them to create and then take form of a titan and wreck havoc. And since the titans seem to be made of nothing and only powered by sunlight, these "mad scientists" also created those that seem to have no goal other than to eat humans. The origins of these "mad scientists" probably would stem from maybe that they were suppose to be rich and lost their wealth to current royal family and now seek everlasting revenge.

Then Erwin said something along the lines of Eren be will a great addition and so on, and help humanity and what not. Then Zacharias pretty much said cut the crap, you have something else planned. Then Erwin said you are always keen mike. And after watching episode 19, my theory has been more disproven than proven. But Erwin still seems sketch imo. Edit: clarity</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Laptop Internet issue ( Ethernet)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-26 20:13:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, Disclaimer: I really don't know much about pcs. So I have a Asus GL552VW laptop it has windows 10 as its operating system. I have been using an Ethernet connection ever since I got my laptop, I would say that is around 6 months. The problem: This all started yesterday, I was noticing that as I was watching a video, it was lagging horrendously. So I proceeded to refresh the page, and it seemed like it sort of helped. Later on I had noticed that it was taking like 10-30 secs for a page to load. It was getting late, so I decided to go to sleep. Next day, when I turn my laptop on. The internet symbol for the Ethernet has a yellow exclamation mark and the internet on my laptop is not working. I immediately pressed the trouble shoot button, and now got a message that said something along the lines of "connection between your access point, modem or router appears to broken." Naturally, I then checked if the wifi was working and it was. So I attempted to google solutions for the next couple of hours. This is what I tried and the results I got. So first I reset my router, didn't do anything. Then I changed the Ethernet cable, still nothing. I changed the port that I put the cable into my router, still nothing. I restarted my laptop, removed the battery still nothing. Then I disabled the all the Ethernet drives, and restarted my computer and the reenabled them, and to my surprise the exclamation mark was gone. But when I tried to open a page, the only one that opened was YouTube, and very very slowly at that. So I then uninstalled the Ethernet driver and restarted my laptop and and it stopped working again. Oh I also checked using the Ethernet cable and a apple laptop using a USB-Ethernet adapter and it worked perfectly fine. Any help would be really appreciated. Thank you for your time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] some questions and thoughts (upto episode 15)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-28 12:41:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Before I ask, damn. Episode 15, was breath taking, I have been greatly enjoying the anime thus far. The start was a little slow/repetitive,but I understand why it had to be done. Firstly, I have googled this but I can seem to find a concrete answer without spoilers listed in the page title. The question is will a second season of Re:Zero come out, if so when could we expect it to come out? Has it been announced or planned to be announced? Second question, is it worth reading the manga in general? Or is it worth reading if the second season would or would not come out? Thirdly, do we ever find out or maybe I missed something about the fact that he can't talk about him coming back to life? Fourthly, is there or will there be anymore backstory on who Natsuki Subaru is? Other than the fact that he was transported to a fantasy world. Lastly, I know that I am trying really hard not to binge watch this anime, but it is hard. After, I am done with the show and sad that it's over. Is there any other anime that's somewhat similar, sort of fantasy still? I understand that this anime is quite unique with its story, but maybe anime that you had watched after Re:Zero that you enjoyed? Keep in mind I have only watched to episode 15, and I could missed something as I was watching. Thank you for your time! Edit 1: clarity Edit 2: Thought of another question.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] Rem Appreciation Thread</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-02 20:53:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently finished watching episodes 15-18. After, finishing those episodes, my heart is shattered. Subaru is really dumb in my opinion, for not choosing the character that truly respects him for who he is and his actions. Rem has proven to be a very lovable character, and see seems to never have anything go her way. Whether that be Ram being stronger than her (when she had her horn) and Ram always being praised. Then Subaru rejected her, but she still managed to be happy and help him. Rem is probably if not my favorite character. I especially enjoy her character development, through out the anime. Anyway, I thought it would be cool to appreciate her character as she seems to be the one always helping others and sacrificing herself. Feel free to share your thoughts, talk about a favorite scene or link a art/picture about/of Rem. Btw I didn't see a post over this when I was searching so I thought it would be neat. EDIT 1: Changed some words for clarity purposes. EDIT 2: So I want to clarify that I meant that when Rem sacrifices and devotes herself for others I meant to refer to her sister and Subaru (those that are very close and important to her) sorry for the the confusion. Thanks to @Enzy- and @Iron_Maw for pointing that out!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A couple questions from a noob...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-11 18:57:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I bought dark souls 3 a while back, but I had trouble with the first boss, and now I picked it up back again. This time I want to try to get as close to beating the game as I can (probably not possibly, but it's worth a shot...right?). Feel free to answer any, none or link me to where I could find answers. I'm new to this sub, so please no hate. I am really uninformed. Now time for the questions.... So I chose the mercenary class, because I wanted to create a quick attacking, somewhat stealthy slasher. Someone who attacks very fast and rapidly. Now I have googled that, but I can't seem to find anything. So is it possible to achieve this goal? Am searching for it wrong? If it is possible to achieve this, what weapon(s) should I strive to get? Also, I just want to attack fast, so whether it's one handed or two handed doesn't bother me. (Pretty dumb I know, but I think it would make it a fun experience). Should I just max dex, endurance and vigor? Or should prioritize one in particular? In also quite uniformed on weapon upgrading and scaling, so if some one could explain that briefly I would be very grateful! Thank you for your time! Edit 1: I wanted to clarify that I am looking for a weapon or weapons (dual wielding) that would allow me to attack very fast (in rapid succession). If that makes sense? Or do all the weapons attack at the same speed?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn, I sort of want to and don't want to. Am I at a high disadvantage for choosing the mercenary class? Also, I'm really bad at the game. It took me like ~3 hours to beat the first boss. The first time I tried I just got the game when it first came out. I tried beating the first boss, spent an hour trying. But I thought, I guess it was never meant to be. But recently I picked it up again, because I wanted to play again. I spent two hours trying to beat the boss, and it felt like I beat 3 other games after I beat the first boss. First of this is probably sad af. Second I probably won't be able to beat the second boss at this rate. And now I don't know if I should start over and choose the knight class. :( Edit 1: clarity</TEXT>

    <TITLE>External GPU for my laptop questions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-20 03:55:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, So I have a couple questions I am seeking answers to, but I am having a hard time finding. I have a Asus ROG GL552VW gaming laptop, and recently its gpu (which is 960m) has not been cutting it for me. So I saw the idea of a external gpu, and I want to do it. However, I don't know if my laptop is compatible. I have seen lots of the mPCIe to PCIe adapters. But I don't know if my laptop has a slot like that. Also would it work on laptop? If I were to buy a gpu like a 980 or 1060 would it be compatible and would my laptop bottleneck it or not? Any answers are appreciated! EDIT 1: forgot a word</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I wasn't planning on doing that. Since the external gpu holder is so expensive. I was planning on getting a ~$60 mPCIe to PCIe slot adapter. It looks much more sketchy, but it's cheap and has better connection? ( I don't know). I also don't know if it's safe enough, or if it would work with my laptop. Although the site that is selling it says it should. But I haven't seen anyone test on the laptop I have. At this point I'm getting desperate, since I can't play high end games... like witcher 3 and neir:automata... Edit 1: grammar</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-21 03:31:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, So I just have a few questions about egpus, however I am overwhelmed with information... so please help me! I have an Asus ROG GL552VW gaming laptop, and I recently wanted to try to play some more graphic intensive games. However, I overestimated my gtx geforce 960m's power. So I saw this cool idea. The problem is I can't find anyone that has tested it on the laptop model I have, so I am not sure if it will work. I also saw a thread saying that it is really hard to get a gtx 1060 to work (which is the gpu I plan on getting), is that true? But could something like or similar to the EXP GDC V7.0 Beast Laptop External Independent Video Card Dock work with my laptop and a gtx 1060? If so how could I a very non tech savvy guy figure how do plug and download the right things? Also some people are telling me that the PCIE slot could bottleneck the GPU is that true? Any sort of help or reference is appreciate! I am just so overwhelmed and confused .. Also if something doesn't make sense, forgive me please, I am not that knowledgeable with pcs. Have a Great Day and thank you for your time! EDIT 1: words and grammar EDIT 2: Some additional questions how can I figure out what sort of PICE slot(1x 2x or 3x) my laptop has? And how do I know where to locate it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Laptop help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-23 00:44:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, So I recently received some bad news regarding my laptop. I even got my laptop quite recently. The bad news is actually two parts, the parts are related. It all started when I wanted to start playing some more graphic intensive games. However, I overestimated the power of a gtx GeForce 960m, and I was unable to play those games. At that point I began to research the possibility of upgrading a laptops gpu. I came across the concept of egpus, and just when I thought I had struck gold. My laptop was not compatible ;(. So now as a last resort, I have decided to sell my laptop, since there is no point. I would like to point out, my intention is not to advertise. But seek advice and seek help from this community that is vastly more knowledgeable on this subject than me. As this gaming laptop, was my first and only legit gaming system. Now onto the questions. So I have a Asus GL552vw-dh71 laptop. I have been using it like 4 months now. It has no scratches and no fingerprint marks. I rarely touched the laptop, due to the fact that I had set it on a cooling pad, and attached an external mouse, keyboard and monitor. I was wondering how much I could reasonable sell this laptop for? Any help or linking me to a resource that could help is highly appreciated! Thank you for your time and have a great day! EDIT 1: changed some words, for clarity.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A couple questions after finishing SAO II</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-07 21:47:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>So first off I'd like to say that I completely didn't expect the episodes with Yuuki, where someone dies. And I couldn't believe how effective they made those couple episodes, like I was sobbing at the end. Anyway onto the actual questions. 1. So after the whole Death Gun incident was over, one of the brothers gave Kirito a message which if my memory didn't fail was something along the lines of "It's not over yet, you can't stop what's coming!" I think? So my question is that something that was forgotten, or will that be included in the next season or arc? 2. Okay so Kayaba transferred his mind/himself to the virtual reality, right? So how come Kirito and the others didn't want to try that? I mean I feel that would be quite useful in terms of saving people who could potentially not be cured. Especially since the last few episodes had to do with the medical applications of virtual reality. Which made expect Yuuki to be "resurrected" in the virtual reality. What do you guys think about that? Thanks for your time!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the fast response! Gotcha, so I assume that the Death Gun hasn't ended then. Interesting, that makes sense. Although, it wouldn't been interesting if Yuuki had an AI made of her though, at least imo.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-11 23:11:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, So I know that you guys get a lot of these posts... Umm so I have played maple on and off, but I quit playing like 3 years ago. Recently I have been thinking of coming back to play causally and not that much. My questions are (I want to create a new character.)All my characters are in Scania, my equips are meh I have some tyrants and some fafnir weapons but my NL range was pretty low like 145000 buffed I think. Plus I was shit at merching, so knowing that do you guys think that reboot would be better suited for me now(btw I still don't fully get what reboot is other than you can get cubes with mesos)? Or should I stick with scania? Reboot questions: Can I get cash shop equips, or permanent nx equips in reboot? What's the range achievable for causal playing on reboot vs trying for the beat range? (Is possible to get 2mill-2mill, clean on reboot)? Thank you for your time! Edit : changed a word</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, So I have been attempting the Wonderiod JQ pretty much daily, I can do B4,B3, and B2 in a breeze. However I cannot do B1 for the life of me, now yesterday they changed the B1 and B4 map slightly. In B1 they made the mist/spray thing more complex in its middle area on the conveyor belt. My question therefore is, is it still possible to backtrack on the conveyor belt, or do are the lasers the only way. If both ways are possible which one is easier. I have watched all the videos I could of people doing it but I couldn't find any with this new change. Thank you for your time! EDIT: Changed a word EDIT 2: I am wrong, I guess I am crazy they didn't update it, I dunno anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I finished the anime just recently, at first I didn't think I would enjoy it at all. I was so wrong. So I obviously googled to find more content, disappointed in the fact that the second season hasn't been announced. But then I saw that there would be a movie. Now, I tried googling it and searching the subbredit, but I still can't find where I can watch the movie. Could anyone link me or tell me where I could watch the movie I would be very grateful. Also, I have heard differing opinions on whether to read up volume 6 first or just watch the movie. I usually don't read light novels. But if it's highly recommended then I'll probably do it. So what do you all think? Thanks in advance and have a great day!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An interesting event idea</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-19 22:59:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, basically I've been thinking of various interesting ideas that would be neat to watch. The one I thought that was most interesting would go like this. So there would be the 1v1 version and the 5v5 version, and the whole idea would be that there would be, lets say three 0-3k players, four 3-5k players and three 5-10k players (this obviously includes proplayers). The next part, would be where everyone would be given a number as a name (from 1-10). This way no one knows who is who. Then the players would be randomly chosen to either be on a team in the case of a 5v5 or for a 1v1. The match would then commence, and there would also be a panel rather than casters who would evaluate most if not all the decisions that the players do real time not after the game. Then at the end they would have to guess what mmr each player had by the decisions they made. Explaining what caused success and failure, this way it would teach new concepts through error and be enjoyable to watch. Now I know this idea isn't perfect, but with some tweaks maybe it could be enjoyable to watch and fun for the participants, aswell. Thanks for reading!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What to watch after...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-30 05:19:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I am at a bit of a standstill. Since, for some reason (this has only seem to been to case for when I watch anime) I get seriously sentimental and into any anime I watch. However, whenever I watch other TV shows (e.g live action,etc) I do not get this feeling. Overall, I am an anime newbie, I've watched maybe around 20-25 animes? Some of them were long (like One Piece and Hunter x Hunter). ANYWAY, sorry for the ramble. What I want to ask is, I am open to any animes that are good and known. I tried to search for many animes to watch, but I just don't know which one to watch next. The last couple of animes I watched were Fate series, Tokyo Ghoul, and Parasyte. Which I all really enjoyed. And I just finished Parasyte...so I wanted to watch more of that type of style, but that always happens when I finish an anime with a certain style. Which is why I need your help. I am open to any suggestions, please help! I am also open to try new genres. Thank you in advance! My full list of animes that I watched: Hunter x Hunter (2011) , One Piece , Akame ga Kill , Sword Art Online series , Attack on Titan series , No Game No Life , Kill La Kill , Twin Star Excorcists , Blue Excorcist , Angel Beats , Boku No Hero Academia , Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon , Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! series , Mob Psycho 100 , Re:Zero , Fate Series , Tokyo Ghoul , Parasyte EDIT 1: added some commas so anime list was not so jumbled. EDIT 2: Thanks to everyone that suggested an anime or animes. I really appreciate it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The main problem, is that toxicity fuels further toxicity. Of course that's not the cause for all. However, from my experience this is what I see. A new player starts playing, he/she gets matched against someone with more experience then them. They unfortunately lose, while getting comments like "ez mid", "ez" , "insert any given flame text here", etc. So they want to start using it. And the cycle continues. I highly doubt that dota 2 will non toxic and nice to new players, it would require to many people to change.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Internet won't work on my laptop (neither through Ethernet or wifi)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-02 03:36:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Neither Ethernet nor wifi work on my laptop. This started when my internet provider cut my service, because their system glitched out. Then suddenly every apple device (MacBooks and iPhones) ,no problem connecting. Yet, my windows laptop doesn't want to connect through wifi or Ethernet. Funny thing is if I plug the Ethernet cable directly into the wall then it works. I tried everything I could find online regarding resetting ipconfig stuff in the CMD console. I tried changing the physical address. Normally this wouldn't be too much of an issue, since I could just plug it into the wall. But then my family wouldn't have internet on their devices. I am stumped and very frustrated. Please help!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for a particular style of clothing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-06 22:28:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have been looking around and searching on web a lot recently. However, I haven't been able to exactly find what I am looking for or at least for a fairly reasonable price that is since I'm in college. So the style of clothing I'm looking is for shirts, that are asymmetrical in color and length. Shirts with random patterns, shirts with one long sleeve and one short sleeve and things of the sort. I found some Japanese brands, but there are a couple of issues. It appears you can't order from their websites directly, but only through a service like (white rabbit express), which on top of the clothing price gets really expensive. Some of the clothing that I am talking about looks like [this](http://syte.yohjiyamamoto.co.jp/item/detail/1_1_UD-T87-823/3). Most of Yohji Yamamoto's clothing is my style, but its accessibility and price are the two factors preventing me from buying the clothing. Are they any other cheaper or more accessible brands or web-stores that sell similar style of clothing. Sort of like Yesstyle. Any help is greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Study Abroad questions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-13 18:12:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, So I have a couple of study abroad questions, I have been trying to find answers to. However, I have not been able to find them online. My first question is this, I have always dreamed of going to study in Tokyo. I saw that the University of Tokyo has an exchange program. However, my university is not partnered with the University of Tokyo for this exchange program. In their "FAQ" they said that universities that are not partnered with them are not eligible. However, is there a way that I could still do that exchange program through one of the universities on the list? Has this ever been done before, is it feasible? If not what are the other options? My second question is, how well can lectures (in Japanese, or any other language) be understood after 2 semesters and 4 semesters of taking a language course, on average and from personal experience. Any help is appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I see what you are saying. Although I am pessimist, I think that there some potential in a less toxic DOTA game experience in the upcoming future. Thing is, is that toxicity also stems from the game itself. Let me explain, someone playing a core role might get frustrated because he is getting zoned, ganked, killed, etc. He/she like any human, as it is in human nature, will shoulder the blame on the lack of vision or support from his/her team. This situation could also have the supports be frustrated by their lack of performance and etc.I know you be targeting a different type of toxic behavior, but this is the one type of behavior I think want to clarify that I meant. I think with the human nature of wanting to win, there will unfortunately always be toxicity. People who are innately toxic by nature, when put into a positive environment, I agree with you, will become less toxic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a lot of games where we lost all lanes, our fucking t3 was being attacked at the 12 min mark. Our AM was chased out of lane. Our supports wanted the game to end, but we managed to convince them to not give up. We were holed up in base and watched them take all our racks slowly; as we tried to stop them but ultimately couldn #8217;t. We still didn #8217;t give up. They then went for our t4s and we wiped them. We pushed the lanes out the best we could and went back to defending once they were respawning. Their gyro went rapier and died, and after a couple of favorable fights that ensued we actually won 63 mins in. I feel you, Never give, never surrender!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Two Cents on "the Adults", theory/speculation (Spoilers mention of content up to episode 5)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-11 21:08:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been thinking, all the adults that we've seen thus far that are not involved in taking care of the parasites (so not Nana, Hachi, Dr. Franxx) have all been in a suit with a mask, or so it seems. The squad from plantation 26, also seemed to be hiding something when Zorome asked his question about if they knew about anyone that has become an adult. And they answered with little explanation, simply saying no. But they also seemed to know something. Knowing all this information got me thinking further, now this may sound far-fetched, but hear me out. So I think that all the adults other than the caretakers, and parasites are robots. If you look at Papa and the council he meets with, they are all irregularly shaped. Their voices sound robotic, as well. Their face/mask don't resemble a typical human face. During the ceremony, none of the aforementioned adults, showed any skin not even their face. This seems a little odd. Why don't the caretakers (i.e. Nana and Hachi) and Dr. Franxx have such a get up. Even Dr. Franxx is cyborg, and his part of the face that is robotic also resembles the look of the other masks/faces the other adults have. What's more interesting, is the massive segregation between the parasites and the adults. The parasites never come into direct contact with the adults other than the caretakers. Does that mean, that when the parasites grow up and if they survive they become caretakers? I don't think this theory was posted, I tried "ctrl F" searching. But if this has been posted already, please tell and I'll take it down. There have been a lot of theories, I've tried to keep up with most but I might of missed it. Apologies in advance! Thanks for reading! Edi1: changed a word and added a word for clarity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I agree that's exactly what I thinking as well. Another wild speculation to add to your idea is that what if only certain digits, can become caretakers. Or even maybe that the digits signify the potential to become a caretaker. Also, it's interesting how 02 is called 02, but Nana and Hachi are just called 7 and 8, not 07 and 08. So maybe the zero is dropped, if/when someone would become a caretaker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I definitely could see the front lines being a battle against the rebellion. Interesting take on them(the adults) being Kyoryuu, if that were to be the case, why would they want to train parasites? Another thing that's interesting, now that you mentioned the adults potentially being Kyoryuu. Is the name of the children, parasites, that doesn't sound very pleasant. With the rise of evidence, supporting the blue oni theory, and everyone basically saying the weak die the strong live on. Maybe, just maybe, if the adults were Kyoryuu, they want to create human hybrids, in other to create a powerful force. The other thing is, we really don't know what caused the klaxosaurs to come into existence and what they are either. I'm getting way ahead of myself, with these theories/speculations, there is so many interesting routes this could go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That would make a lot of sense, but if he would be related to papa why would he be on plantation 13? Why would he be accused of  #8220;tainting #8221; 02 as her stamen. Sure, they call him a special specimen, but that could just be because of a different reason that we don #8217;t know yet. For example, we don #8217;t know what the numbers mean, maybe certain numbers were given certain genes, given certain drugs, etc. I think, that if your idea is true it would be an awesome backstory. Fully support this idea, think it would be awesome to see the reactions of 02 and hiro knowing that were once together. However, another thing bothers me and that is, if they wiped 02 #8217;s and Hiro #8217;s memory and wanted the separate, then proceed to bring over 02 to plantation 13, with seemingly no reason. The potential answers for this could be a. 02 retained part of her memories and purposely through her rebellious behavior made a stop there or b. Complete coincidence and lack of oversight by the adults. But those answers also bring up a lot of questions in themselves, how/why did 02 retain her memories? Why was there a lack of foresight?

    <TEXT>See, this is really interesting in itself, because if that really is an oni horn under that metal, which it seems 100% to be. And considering that most of the adults, wear some sort of masks and suits that cover up their entire body. This would lead me to speculate, that the klaxosuar #8217;s purpose, might not be necessarily to kill humans, but rather infect them. This, raises other questions, what benefit would the klaxosaurs get from doing this? Maybe, that #8217;s how the klaxosuars reproduce? It also raises an interesting question, on why parasites are called parasites?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not the most anime experienced person, only watching anime for about 3-4 years. However, in my experience thus far I have noticed that characters fall in categories, you can label certain characters. I think, at least imho, that Zero Two is not like that for the most part. Some may say, that she can be labeled as a certain character type, I wouldn #8217;t necessarily disagree with that fully. However, her personality seems very realistic to me at least, this is harder for me to explain. But hear me out, if you look at other anime characters they act in a certain why that can be predictable. With Zero Two, it #8217;s hard to do that. There is more to it than that, but again I dunno how to fully explain it. I guess the another way to explain it would be originality. It #8217;s interesting, to see how the character #8217;s actions aren #8217;t predicted. I also like her personality, rebellious nature, almost two faced, scary (but not innately set out to destroy) and her struggle with the discrimination of being part klaxosaur. I think the scene in episode 5, where Ichigo was outside with Zero Two talking about Hiro demonstrated her two sided nature well. Not only , that but when Ichigo slapped her and her band for the horns fell off and showed her demonic side and called her heartless. See the normal assumption (at least from my perspective) would have been a violent response from Zero Two would be some sort of violent response. And the way she responded  #8220;what is  #8220;human #8221; to you people #8221; damn. Again, there is more to it than that but it #8217;s just hard to explain. :( TL:DR: Very interesting, realistic and unpredictable personality. Edit 1: PS sorry this being so long , also if there any typos I wrote this on mobile so bare with me lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I think that some people might have rated the episodes after episode 1 badly, might have been because they were disturbed by the way the pilots pilot the mechas(or some other reason). Then later those people could have been swayed by the good reviews to give the show another shot, and after they did they regretted everything. Also, more people probably got around to watching the show. There a lot of factors at play here though, so it's hard to say exactly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that would be neat, but have a feeling it's going to very similar to these results. With maybe more votes for Ichigo through Goro (Delphinium). My prediction would be Sterlizia, Delphinium, Genista, Argentea and last but not least Chlorophytum. Although, strelizia and delphinium might be more tied? I'm probably wrong tho</TEXT>

I could see that, how we would explain Nana and Hachi? Maybe that once a parasite becomes an adult and/if they survive up until that point they become a caretaker?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is good, I like this theory. You also got me thinking, on why wouldn't they want adults piloting the Franxx mechas? What's even more interesting is, most stamens die after 3 flights with Zero Two, right? This stamen you are referring to in episode 1, most likely suffered the same fate (after the 3rd flight he died as we saw). And as you say, it looks like this guy is an adult who has a had a long life. What has he been doing all this time before his 3 flights with Zero Two? Why is he the only adult piloting a Franxx?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting, yeah I agree with that. Yeah, I don't think the parasite die when they reach adulthood. I think it's more along the lines, that piloting is very demanding and probably has a big strain on the body. So maybe most parasites, aren't able to withstand long enough/survive enough battles if they are able to withstand it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right right, that is interesting, and I think there might even be more to it than just keeping them submissive. I mean Zero Two has access to a lot of things, possibly, because she already knows all the secrets? Maybe, that has to do with the scene we see in episode 1 where she is in her demonic state?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I was thinking, with a large number of theories floating around basically everyweek predicting what will happen in the next episode. I was thinking, maybe we could create this weekly post where right before the actual episode airs, so let's say like Friday. With/without the help of the episode teaser we could vote on(straw poll), which theory we think might be proven to happen? Then we could see after the episode, the statistic of the theories. I think that would be pretty neat, but what do you all think? Has potential? Bad idea?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weekly Theory Prediction or the next episode (6): Is it theory or fact let's find out!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-16 17:53:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Whoops I screwed up the title it's supposed to be "Weekly Theory Prediction **for** the next episode (6): Is it theory or fact let's find out!" Hello everyone, Is everyone pumped for episode 6?!?! This is me [rn](https://imgur.com/gallery/wtoNI) thinking about all these theories. I posted a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7xtr6y/potential_idea/) yesterday asking if you all would enjoy this idea of posting a post with all the prediction theories for the next episode on Thursday or Friday then vote on which theory will be displayed in the upcoming episode. You all seemed to like the idea, which made me happy :) Here is the [**poll**](http://www.strawpoll.me/15085945), what I decided to do is instead of voting for just one theory, I made it so you can vote on how many theories you think will happen instead of just one. I also broke some theories apart, since some people had multiple parts to their theories, I made it so that you can vote on the individual parts you might think will happen and not have to vote for everything (if you don't believe every part of the theory will happen for example) Therefore, I went through and compiled all the theories. I apologize if I missed a theory, I tried to look for theories even in the comments of some of the threads, but if I missed a theory please let me know and I'll add it. I will provide a brief summary of the theory, provide a link and give credit to the author(s). There is a lot of improvement that can be done, so please tell me what you like and dislike! :) [**Blue Oni Theory + more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wopy0/the_road_of_episode_6_and_a_potential_outlook_of/) (/u/OnlyAnEssenceThief) -- This is probably the most popular theory going around. The theory that Hiro will become a Klaxosaur hybrid.  gt;tl;dr: Hiro becomes a half-klaxosaur like 02 in Episode 6 with near-100% certainty. After Episode 6 is hard to tell though I'm leaning on 02/Hiro being relocated as a pair to the front lines. There are other parts to this theory as well, of how Hiro will deal/face the infection, highly recommend reading u/OnlyAnEssenceThief's theory (if you haven't had the chance yet). I will split the parts of this theory into smaller ones, so if you agree with some parts, but not all you can vote for the ones you agree with. **Blue Oni Theory transformation Prediction** (/u/fandom_doodler): This is a fun one I am throwing in, so I there is a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wtfne/hiros_transformation_will_look_like_rin_from_blue/) predicting that Hiro's transformation will be similar to Rin's from "Blue Exorcist." Do you believe it will generic or flashy? **Theory on 02** (/u/ZyoTheBlackhat and /u/4d656761466167676f74): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wol9j/my_thoughts_on_the_symbolism_of_02/) and this [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7xm8hf/my_take_on_zero_two/) basically talks about how 02 isn't trying to be a villain, but instead wants to be accepted by someone. She is treated so because of her Klaxosuar blood and partner killing that happen.  gt;Tl;dr 02 isn't an evil villain. She's the girl who just can't get a relationship to work, became jaded and cynical, developed a bad reputation, and now just messes with people because it's easier than getting hurt again. (From ZyoTheBlackhat)  gt; Zero Two isn #8217;t heartless at all. She actually wants to protect everyone. However, years of people ridiculing, ostracising, and blaming her has caused her to build up a superiority mentality as a way to deal with the grief. In reality, she blames herself for everyone who has died. She just wants to be treated like a normal person. (From 4d656761466167676f74). Maybe we see a new side of 02 after episode 6, where she finally reveals who she really is? (**Hiro's piloting ability**)[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7xr9ae/hiros_potential_ability_to_pilot/] (/u/GTCvEnkai):  gt;Here's my theory: Hiro, either by a selection process or created, was made to be 02's partner specifically. Hiro is noted to be unusual long before his encounter with 02, as mentioned above he was always considered the "special" one of the group and even the other children of his group envisioned him as their leader when the day came for them to become pilots.  gt;Hiro could be tailor made for 02 as a partner. His unusual background, behavior and traits single him out not as a typical pilot support the idea that Hiro's partner can only be 02. **02 is the Devil Theory** (/u/LightDragonman1): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7xtu5n/bit_of_a_crack_theory_i_stumbled_across/) is about  gt;that Zero Two is basically the devil in this show, what with her horns and color motive, and the fact that she #8217;s tempting Hiro and doesn #8217;t bother to pray to Papa when they are eating. **RIP Plantation 26 and Strelizia is incapacitated by Hiro's growing infection theory** (/u/TriPolar3849): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7x4g58/what_i_think_will_happen_next_episode/)  gt;I'm guess the first half of episode 6 will still just be preparations, and then the second half will be actual fighting. Hiro is going to become weak due to the infection/tumor thing in the middle of the fight, making Strelizia useless and causing the redshirt kids to be wiped out along with a lot of worrying from Ichigo and Goro. Then, Zero Two's gonna say something like "stop fighting it". Hiro's does exactly that, and the episode ends with Hiro's eyes glowing blue and horns coming out of his head. **Blue and Red Energy Strelizia theory** (/u/CyclopeWarrior): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7x7vqb/speculation_on_the_upcoming_battle/) goes into detail to explain how the battle will go about. Summarizing the theory it talks about how squad 26 struggles later on during the battle. Squad 13 is eager to help to them, but they become overwhelmed as well.  gt;A light starts to glow inside the mountain of klaxos surrounding the strelizia, blue and red, a flash of light and explosive energy, this now overwhelming power strikes down all remaining klaxos in some fast and powerful strikes. The last thing Ichigo sees before falling from exhaustion is the silhouette of a franxx....with shining eyes....blue and red..... **Ichigo infected theory** (/u/Trabant777): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wpaow/ichigo_might_be_in_danger_spoilers_for_episode_5/) talks about  gt;If Hiro got infected from his first time connecting with 02 and then he piloted with Ichigo afterwards there's a possibility that she could already be infected with whatever Hiro has growing on him. **Color Theory and Telepathic Theory** (/u/JayceDroppedTheBass): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wz32e/color_theory/) predicts that  gt;all of the Klaxosaurs have been blue and exploded the same blue gunk as what has been attached to Hiro's chest. Where 002 is red a which is klaxosaur color scheme we haven scene yet. As well as,  gt;Hiro will be able to connect to the Klaxosaurs telepathically or in some other way where he becomes even more important than 002. **Combination of theories** (mainly using the one about Hiro being code 00, since it could pertain to the next episode) (/u/Stizzalith): This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7xi0bs/rambling_in_the_franxx_overanalyzing_the_details/) talks about a lot of things, but I think what might pertain the most with the next episode is Hiro potentially being code 00 (revealing something interesting).  gt;The whole calling back Zero Two thing might therefore have been a scheme set up by FranXX in order to bait out Hiro. So who is Hiro actually? My call is that he is Code 000. Dannngg, so there were a lot of theories to sort through. If there were theories I missed or you all thought that something I should add that is related to the next episode, please tell. Or if I should change something please let me, this is the first time I am doing something like this, so I probably made a bunch of mistakes. If you all like this idea and if it works out well, I will try to do these weekly! Disclaimer: If I left out a theory, or part of the theories above and you as the author of said theory think I should have incorporated something or the theory please tell me and I will do so. Who's ready for Saturday!!!! Edit 1: added /u/ for all the mentioned people Edit 2: Apologizes, it won't let me edit the poll, or I wasn't able to begin with it's the first time I made a strawpoll. Therefore, I'm not sure if I'm able to edit the poll after posting it. Edit 3: I screwed up the title :( Edit 4: One of the poll topics is Blue Oni Theory, I apologize the Oni got auto-corrected and it slipped my eyes. Edit 5: Rephrased a sentence in the second to last paragraph</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Episode 6 Prediction Aftermath [Spoilers for episode 6]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-18 19:05:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Everyone, I hope everyone got a chance to see episode 6. That episode was absolutely brilliant! However, I am here because of a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7y0in2/weekly_theory_prediction_or_the_next_episode_6_is/) I posted on Friday. Where I basically I compiled all the theories that either predicted what would happen in the next episode or had a component in their theory that could come to be. I made this [poll](http://www.strawpoll.me/150859450) and I want to analyze the results with everyone :) I will make some brief comments, but I want to hear what you all think. Especially the authors of all of these theories! I made a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FHrc52zecn4WvXGV7GyxACLCSV_6euKknbsRYwsaG3k/edit?usp=sharing) with all the stats. However, I want to go into detail, since some of the predictions somewhat cam true, or had the right idea, or had a part that was true. *Quick disclaimer about the votes, the voters could vote more than once.* Alrightly, lets dive in! The most popular theory and prediction **The Blue Oni Theory** it did not come to fruition as some might have expected. While the theory isn't [dead](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7y99su/official_state_of_blue_oni_theory_assessment_of/) it seems to come to existence in a figurative sense. I highly recommend reading this thread, as u/OnlyAnEssenceThief is the author and has done a really good write up on it. However, I will point out that I've seen some other evidence pointing to that Hiro actually has the yellow blood cells to fight off the infection. Credit to u/TehSpikeKun for pointing it out in that thread. The next most popular theory was that **red and blue energy would shine from 02 and Hiro respectively at the end of the episode from Strelizia.** Strelizia would then become insanely powerful. This theory was partially predicted, Strelizia did become insanely powerful at the end and light did shine. However, I don't now how much we could say the red and blue energy shined. However, there was light that shined so that's why I said it sort of came true, the only missing element was blue and red light. **02 revealing a new face theory** basically showing that she isn't a villain. This theory I don't think was neither disproved or proven. She didn't go out of her way to sabotage squad 26, or anything like that. **Revealed that Hiro was created to be 02's partner and only to be compatible with her**, I think that this is super interesting. So Hiro said something about him only wanting to be compatible with 02, and Dr. Franxx said Hiro just might be the boy to make 02's wish come true. Now, this can be interpreted in a lot ways. It could mean, yes he is the one created specifically for her or maybe he is just really compatible with 02 but wasn't created specifically for 02. Only time will tell. **Reveal that Hiro is actually code 00 theory** really briefly, so far it seems like this may be disproved. We only saw code 00 at the very beginning, and the only person in the scene was Ichigo. Then at the end of the episode we saw one of the Nines call Hiro (at least I think Hiro) Nine Iota. So it's hard to say, but for now I think this theory might be disproved. Also special shout out to u/TheIsolator , u/shseyo and u/Neoshenlong for predicting that Delphinium would freeze due to Hiro. I wasn't able to add their predictions to the poll, as I already posted it and I'm bad and didn't realize I couldn't edit it :( Always looking to improve these posts, so anything you all think I should change next time please tell! Thanks for reading! Edit: word changes Edit2: Changed some sentences, for greater clarity and some more words</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Theory Collection Thread for Weekly Episode Prediction</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-19 21:34:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, So last week I started doing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7y0in2/weekly_theory_prediction_or_the_next_episode_6_is/), where I basically compiled all the theories or parts of theories that could potentially happen or predict what happens in the next episode. I gave a quick overview of the theory, and made a poll for people to vote on which theories they believed would happen then did a [aftermath thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7ygf8p/episode_6_prediction_aftermath_spoilers_for/) where I went through and briefly talked about which predictions came true and which ones didn't. I will try to post this thread on Thursdays or Fridays depending on when time permits and when you all want it to be posted. Anyway, the point of this thread is for anyone who has a potential theory that has to do with the next episode to please post it here. This subreddit is growing super fast and there a lot of theories and posts. I try to be as active and save a lot of them, but I miss some. :( I would really appreciate if you all could post a link to your theory, and additional notes that you have for the next episode. I would be very grateful! Thank you all!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all thank you so much! Good stuff! You made me have a little bit of a light bulb moment when you mentioned  gt;Mitsuru falling and falling ever so deeper to the dark side of the force This is really interesting and got me thinking, maybe there is something that happens to parasites when they start going a little bit power hungry/maniacal, this a farfetched idea but maybe Mitsuru does some sketchy stuff to obtain power later down the road to try to one up Hiro. This is even more farfetched, but maybe Mitsuru tries to assassinate Hiro, because he is frustrated and 02 protects him and never tells Hiro what happened to Mitsuru.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Weekly Prediction Poll] Fan Theory Friday!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-23 21:40:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, I am back again for this week's prediction poll, for those that don't know. This a post, that I am aiming to do weekly where I compile all the theories and prediction for the next episode (in this case episode 7), give a brief description and then create a poll where you can vote on which theories you believe will be proven in the episode. Daaaannngggg, this week had a LOT of predictions, this is awesome!!! There was some overlap between theories, but I didn't omit anyone's overlapping ideas.  #160; I'd like to apologize for two things, the first being that this is verrrrrryyyyyy long post, and second for posting this late I wanted to get this out this morning, but the post took a little longer than anticipated.  #160; Disclaimer due to the length of this post and all the symbols (i.e. *, gt;,],)) I used I might have made some mistakes or forget to put something in, bare with with me please!  #160; Here is the [**Weekly Prediction Poll**](http://poll.fm/5x65b)!!!! Same rules as last time, you can vote for as many theories you like, because some might overlap and some people might want to vote on certain parts of theories I will break apart the theories into more specific options!  #160; The theories will be in no particular order. Without further ado let's begin!  #160; **[Thoughts on Episode 7, small shallow speculation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yrbpg/thoughts_on_episode_7_small_shallow_speculation/)** (by u/CyclopeWarrior): The author's predictions are:  gt;* We will be seing a new dinamic between Hiro and 02, which will be added to 02's already cute coupley behaviour, which im guessing will be like a more mature approachto their relationship. Hiro has passed all tests given by 02, 02 is now on uncharted territory as past partners goes, it is time for Hiro to get some kind of reward, maybe a kiss, maybe a horn boop, maybe to caress 02s horns * We will be meeting some of the Nines, I doubt they will be hiding in the plantation, my guess is we will get some character development for them and see their personalities. Im imagining squad 13 going back to their dorms and seeing the Nines in the living room waiting for them or something, I also expect the small blonde Nine( alpha?) to be super charismatic but also showing a heavy killing aura when he gets mad. Probably lots of joking about getting to pilot with 02 someday (in front of Hiro) * GoBro will at some point have a 1 on 1 talk with Ichigo, Gobro is a Bro, but he cant keep having Ichigo with a meltdown everytime Hiro breaks a nail. Its foot down time for Goro. * Hoping to see character development for the rest of squad 13, Mitsuru falling and falling ever so deeper to the dark side of the force, Futoshi eating some vegetables for once seeing as he had a hard time climbing Beta, not much more we can see from this side of characters. * I just reaaaaally hope we get some more Dr. Franxx, 1 on 1 talk with Hiro, or maybe 1 on 2 talk with Hiro and 02. A little expositon maybe? Maybe some questions about what expects the Strelizia pilots in the future, and their role in the army.  #160; **New Oni Theory idea Theory** (by u/Masukure): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yk6df/my_new_stance_on_blue_oni_theory/) talks about a new perspective, a new take on the Blue Oni theory.  gt;[A] part of me thinks there is a chance that the blue oni will actually be Ichigo. There was that theory that Hiro infected her with a kiss.  #160; **Beach Episode Theory** (by u/RealArt3mis): This [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7zmcck/theory_about_the_beach_episode/) it talks about how the location is odd, a beach where we only see plantation?!? Seems suspicious here is the author's take  gt;[T]here is no dome. This means that the beach and the ocean can #8217;t be on a plantation. So I though as we know that the earth is devastated due to the relentless drilling and mining for magma fuel, what if the beach was Virtual?  #160; **Predictions by u/TheIsolator**: The author summarizes the points very nicely  gt;* A beginning of a next arc, everything has calmed down for now in the series so it will less action-packed as the last episode. I'm ready for more characterization and hints for the future story. * Lot of cute and bonding scenes between Hiro and Zero Two. I predict, no I want them going on something like a date, taking a walk through the garden, talking about the recent events and what the two are planning to do from now on. Perhaps her even telling Hiro her wish. * Dr.Franxx screetime! he finally returned in ep 6 now I want some informations from him about Strelizia growing wings and if it was his plan all along to bring Hiro and Zero Two together. * Mitsuru making up to Hiro and accepting him as a pilot is something I really want. * More Club Lamarck (Papa), giving Hiro his official parasite classification and how they plan to use him in the future. * Nine alpha is here and what's his job: Of course to retrieve Strelizia and their partners back to the frontlines. Will it happen in ep 7 already? probably in episode 8 but he will at least inform Zero Two and Hiro what is coming for them. Will it be a friendly meeting? no I'm sure she despises her Nines fellows and wants to keep a distance between Hiro and them for now. * Blue Oni: is the horn already growing? for me it's hinted in a key visual and the opening that there's something unusual on his head and the blue mass could be still hiding in his body and changing him in silence without him noticing.  #160; **Predictions by u/Zelda_2017**: The author summarizes the points very nicely  gt;It will obviously be the opening of act 2 featuring mainly a training montage. You've heard it here first. * First, Hiro gets a full physical checkup. You don't go flat and back to normal like nothing happened. Nana freaked out when she saw his vitals back on. Hiro is getting probed. It's a noble military organization after all. * Cut to mandatory training montage with Squad 13. Our kids need better team work. Ep 6 made that clear and they were genuinely impressed by how squad 26 dealt with grunts. So buckle up, we're doing push-ups, jumping rope and running with a good dose of fan-service, thank you. * It culminates with best friends frolicking in the breaking waves to awesome music like there's no tomorrow. Called it. * The music is abruptly interrupted by... Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's... an extremely cool looking all white Frank who gracefully lands on the training field. * It says in an unfamiliar voice: "I can take you anytime. All of you." Zorome: "Oh yeah?!? Genista, hold my beer." * Bout between Argentea and ... LILIUM (That's a wild guess, but I'm confident...) * In a flash, Argentea obviously gets served and her ass kicked. * Lilium kneels down and... tada! 9' #945; and his pistil dramatically come out of the cockpit. * The other Nines also come out. * He introduces himself in the cockiest way possible, "You OK there, buddy? We were just playing, right? BTW, my name is 9' #945;, just call me Al... Nice to meet you, ladies". * Miku and Kokoro ~~wet their suits~~ blush and lose their shit "he's so cooooooooool" while the boys make funny faces, "what's up with this guy anyway" (you know the faces) * 9' #945; announces why he's really here for: to take 9' #953; (002 imo) and Strelizia back to the front. * Hiro is conflicted and he's about to say something when... Alarm, two huge klax incoming! All units in position!  #160; **Prediction by u/megumax**: This author also summerizes their prediction very well  gt;All of the kids have klaxosaur blood in them, just it #8217;s not as obvious in the later models as in the earlier prototypes (e.g. zero two). That #8217;s what makes the kids separate from the adults. The kids were created in an Evangelion-style experiment to find a way to fight the klaxosaurs.  #160; **How to train your Klaxosaur, a useful handbook covering everything you need to know theory** (by u/Stizzalith): The this [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7ya5tz/how_to_train_your_klaxosaur_a_useful_handbook/) is very in-depth and the author mentioned to me that only  gt;the appearance of a Bullen /Lehmann Class or a Repiti Class Klaxosaur towards the second half of the episode. could be applicable for this next upcoming episode. The classes as the author puts them  gt; **It has to do with depth!** Mohorovicic (or Moho for short), Gutenberg and Conrad all are names of discontinuities. What is a discontinuity? Well, basically Earth is made of different layers, which are made of different materials. The biggest difference lays in their physical and chemical properties, such as temperature or density. Layers are separated by transition zones, which are called "Discontinuities".  #160; **Additional Predictions by u/Stizzalith** :  gt;* The only way for Hiro to get involved with the Nines is becoming a part of them IMO. * And i feel that it's still a bit early for that (if it's ever going to happen to begin with, since for how i see it the Nines might very well turn out to be the antagonists at some point, especially if APE turns out to be bad news. * [A] status check of Hiro's health, and i hope a good explanation of why Hiro isn't a blue pile of dead. * Maybe Zero Two will start showing a new, more fragile side to Hiro, since now he's basically proven that he has what it takes to support her. * I also expect Goro to have a good talk with Hiro at some point * [S]ee some sort of Klaxosaur battle towards the end of the episode, i'd say a Moho Class if i had to pick one, maybe two of them at the same time?  #160; **[Predictions by u/Darling002](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yrbpg/thoughts_on_episode_7_small_shallow_speculation/)** : Thoughts and Predictions: Here are the predictions made by the author  gt;* I think opening scene is going to be APE Council discussing Hiro's "accomplishment" and what they might do with him and 002. Front lines could be a possibility, but its probably to soon in the series. * Hiro is probably going to go through some testing on his body to see the state it is in. Blue Tumor is gone, Goro is going to make a comment on it. * The Nines might speak to Hiro only, they seem only interested in him then the other members. Might get a scene of Nines and Hiro + Zero Two could either go bad or good. Zero Two's reaction is going to be something to watch for sure if they do meet. Dr.FranXX might make another apperance and talk to Zero Two about her dreams. * I think Zero Two emotions might show some more after Hiro surviving the third ride, most likely get a scene of these two alone talking. * Also at least 6 darlings will be said and be added to the collection.  #160; [**Nine Iota's True identity: A resolution? theory**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7z1sx8/nine_iotas_true_identity_a_resolution/) (by u/DitFCodeAlpha): The author talks about how Nine Iota may not be a person, but a Frannxx instead specifically  gt;Nine Iota may refer to the Hiro Two ship actually reaching a new level. Correction: I misunderstood this theory. The author was saying  gt;The only thing I have to say is that I was not referring to Strelizia, but the actual relationship between 016 and 002. Apologies  #160; [**Fan Theory on Who Is "Nine Iota"**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7y9nkm/spoilers_fan_theory_on_who_is_nine_iota/) (by u/KennyLeeT): This theory talks about how Nine Iota could be Hiro, by saying that  gt;if you look at the phrase as 9I (Nine-Iota) and flip it, it comes out as 16. Also, if you use Greek numerals, to count, Iota=10. So, Nine-Iota would be 910, or 016 turned around. Also mentioning, how in the episode opening we see distorted numbers by Hiro  gt;Which at first glance looks like it "716" but, can also be viewed as an inverted 9| #42566; (Nine|Iota), given how the letter is written with its curve. The author also mentions  gt;perhaps Hiro has more of a history than just growing up on the plantation, perhaps he was transferred over for some reason?  #160; [**Theorizing about  #8220;Nine Iota #8221;**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yapb9/theorizing_about_nine_iota/) (by u/Msakwrmslt): This theory predicts that Hiro will (or already has) become a member of the Nines since  gt;they refer to Strelizia as  #8220;code beta #8221;. Beta is the second letter of the greek alphabet, and it #8217;s 02 #8217;s number obviously. It #8217;s reasonable to assume then that the Nines call themselves Nine Alpha, Beta, etc. So, because Hiro survived the third ride, he #8217;ll now become part of the Nines as Nine Iota, the 10th member and partner of 02.  #160; [**Blue Oni theory post episode 6.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7y82tb/blue_oni_theory_post_episode_6/) (by u/nachoolo): I am using this theory, partially because there is a chance we might see something that has to do with the Blue Oni theory in episode 7. The author says that the  gt;Blue Oni was the plan at the beginning, but for some reason it was change later in productions, leaving a lot of foreshadowing in the episodes, becoming a Red Herring by accident. There is also a second part, where the Blue Oni Theory was a red herring for the beginning, but it will eventually come to be later on. However, since it doesn't really pertain to the next episode, I will not add it to the poll.  #160; [**Darling in the Franxx: Episode 6 Summary + Bingo List for Episode 7**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7z7k7r/darling_in_the_franxx_episode_6_summary_bingo/) (by u/CipherWind): The author predicts that Hiro is nine Iota, and that Nines were suppose to be called tens. However, since Zero Two's stamens always died, they started being called the nines. And there are therefore 10 seats  gt;After she has finally found her new (possibly permanent) partner able to pilot Strelizia beyond 3 times, 9 #8217; #945; is impressed  amp; called the new guy (Hiro) as Nine Iota, the  #8220;tenth in seat #8221; after them  amp; Zero Two. Here are the author's General predictions:  gt;* Dr. Franxx will assess the situation of Hiro #8217;s condition, along with the debriefing of the battle from Nana  amp; Hachi. * A likely interesting small chat between 26th  amp; 13th Squad about their last battle before departing. * 090 thanking them for saving their lives, apologizing for their underestimation toward them. * Telling their story 2 years ago, their meeting with the "Nines" to further introduce them to the 13th Squad and Hiro before making a formal appearance,  amp; might be added with little bit detail from Zero Two. * Or something less far, like their meeting with Zero Two instead of the whole Nines to tell more about her background. * Relationship between Zero Two  amp; the Nines. Either good, or bad way. * Good, as in Nines #8217; jealousy toward Zero Two for having  #8220;a prodigy #8221; as her partner. * Bad, as in taunting her for finally having a partner who can last longer due to her kept killing his previous partners. * This will also summarize the personality of the Nines crew * APE will make a move again. * Dr. Franxx explaining why he #8217;s in Plantation 13. * Nines #8217; formal appearance following 26th Squad #8217;s conversation with Hiro  amp; 13th Squad.  #160; [**The Nine Iota theory feels like a stretch**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yi9hs/the_nine_iota_theory_feels_like_a_stretch/) (by u/ebmyungneil): Basically, this theory says that Hiro is most likely not Nine Iota, rather Zero Two is.  gt;Iota is the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet, so Nine Iota is most likely  #8220;Ninth-ranked Nine #8221; if Nine Alpha is  #8220;First-ranked Nine. #8221; Also, it makes more sense from a story/coolness perspective for Iota to refer to 002 rather than Hiro, based on other  #8220;Elite X #8221; groups.  #160; [**Is the regime lying to the children about the status of Naomi? Has episode 6 given us the final evidence that was needed to confirm Naomi's death?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7y95zn/is_the_regime_lying_to_the_children_about_the/) (by u/Chemistry_Doge): This theory talks about how Naomi is dead, for a couple of reasons.  gt;Naomi had no function anymore since she wasn't able to pilot a franxx, she was a broken part that had to be thrown away. You have to remember that these children were nothing but numbers to the regime. The second point is more abstract comparing Naomi, which talks about her being the butterfly in the episodes and when see the butterfly get caught in the spider web and die. It also symbolizes Naomi's death, I explained this very briefly so I recommend reading the post if you haven't. The reason I am adding this theory is that it is hard to say when they will mention Naomi again, it could be the next episode it could, it could be in 10. So I will add it just in case.  #160; [**Hopes for Episode 7**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yafg9/hopes_for_episode_7/) (by u/TriPolar3849): The author predicts an episode  gt;to be filled to the brim with cute Hiro/Zero Two scenes. Seeing as how this episode was packed with action, it's very safe to say that next episode will either be plot focused or a filled with fluff as a break from all the fighting. I know the teaser, basically confirmed this, however, you never know there might be something else that could happen, something bad.  #160; [**Zero Two's mysterious wish**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7ygexy/zero_twos_mysterious_wish/) (by u/Chemistry_Doge): This post talks about what Zero Two's wish could be  gt;Zero Two #8217;s wish is to be accepted by everyone. Even though she may be disillusioned in how she wants to achieve this goal, Hiro will play a big role in making her feel accepted, just like the Doctor already said.  #160; Also, this is just my two cents, so from my experience (it could be the genres I watch as well), but beach scenes never end well. Even though they characters are happy and frolic about, I feel like either something bad is going to happen. Or some character is going to reveal something big, just my two cents. This is just based off my gut feeling after watching the episode 7 teaser  #160; Huge thanks to all that posted their predictions in my [Theory Collection Thread for Weekly Episode Prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7yqdvp/theory_collection_thread_for_weekly_episode/)!!!!!  #160; [Thanks for reading and participating!!!](https://images8.alphacoders.com/902/902109.png)  #160; I am super hyped for this next episode!

    <TEXT>Sorry, it took me so long to respond. I think this episode answered a lot, hinted a lot and gave a lot of new questions. I think the thing that stuck with me the most is a lot of good evidence that Hiro's memory was wiped. When he was talking to Ichigo. Dr. Franxx saying "Don't get to emotional attached to Zero Two is him warning him, because if they get too close again they'll have to wipe their memories. Also I think this episode was what the ichibros were wanting haha. I think there are a lot of new questions to be answered thou, Papa and his council referred to Hiro as failed special specimen, very interesting. We also know that planet was not always like it is now, and that something must have happened. Which then leads to comment on magma cores bringing out Klaxosuars, which leads me to believe that these magma cores are doing more than just powering cities and FranXXs. Another thing is near the end of the episode it seems that Zero Two is hiding something, some information from anyone and it seems to be sad. Maybe, it has something to due with her past and Hiro, maybe it has something to do with whats to come. Really hard to tell. There is just so much good information, I might make a rant thread about. I have so much to say, but if I do I will probably rewatch it like 2 more times to make sure I didn't miss any details.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hiro's memory wiped theory expanded [Spoilers from Episode 7]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-25 10:45:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all!  #160; Disclaimer this is a very sleepy boi, who got back very late and moments ago just finished watching the episode very late at night. I tired to look if anyone else posted a post on this but didn't see one, if there was one already posted I'll remove it.  #160; So I just want to put this idea out there. Okay, so there was a post(s) (pardon my memory) about the mention of how in episode 1 we see young Zero Two and Hiro together, couple weeks ago or so. And how they knew each other but their memories were wiped. I think this episode supports that theory very well. Let me elaborate, so it seems like they(Hiro and Zero Two) knew each other before and their memories were indeed wiped, at least Hiro's (sort of it seems). The reason I say this is because the conversation with Ichigo that Hiro had near the end of the episode, she says something along the lines of "oh so you haven't forgotten the things about the stars." As well as, heavily implying that Hiro has forgotten things about the past, and seems that they both already **knew** that. Seems suspicious. Also the reason I say sort of wiped is because he remembers somethings, but not others. These conversations happened when they were young which means that it fits the time frame, when Hiro could have met Zero Two for the first time. What could also be related is how worried Zero Two looked at the end of the episode, it seemed as though she was remembering the good memories with young Hiro and then the sadness of how they were separated. But who knows.  #160; However, there are many questions that are still unanswered. Did they (no idea who could this could have been but most likely Papa's council if anyone) wipe Hiro's memory, because he was "failed special specimen" and he became to emotionally attached to Zero Two? Is that the reason why Dr. Franxx told Hiro not to get too close (emotionally to Zero Two), is that Dr. Franxx saying if Hiro gets to close he will get his memory wiped again? This would bring up yet another question. Why shouldn't Hiro and Zero Two get close emotionally, is it because they will become to powerful, to weak, or something else completely? And I think that most important questions would be, if their memories were wiped first off of why? And second why would they allow them to be reunited?  #160; This is probably mega far fetched, but I just needed to get my idea written out.  #160; What are your thoughts? Am I crazy and just waayy to sleepy or doesn't it seem possible?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah, in the anime it is hard to tell but in the manga we can that they are young [here](https://imgur.com/a/LFxYG). Yeah I thought it was foreshadowing of what's to come as well. I'd assume Zero Two's memory also got partially wiped as well, but maybe not it's hard to tell. Edit: submitted this comment to fast and forget to add the second sentence and third sentence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I agree, a lot would make sense. First off he is a double digit, which throughout the show is shown to be special. However, I think that they lost interest in Hiro when maybe he wasn't able to do something that APE thought he could and that's why they called him a "failed special specimen" in episode 7. And maybe just maybe, after Hiro and Zero Two were made to be partners, Hiro couldn't ride with her or something or he was experiencing negative side effects. And they decided to wipe his memory because of it. In the meantime, Hiro's body could have potentially build up antibodies, and now when they met up again and rode together his body was prepared and was able to withstand the stress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting take, yeah haha I got another idea after I woke where, maybe he wasn't intially compatible with Zero Two. Maybe he could have experienced the negative side effects, and because of that they called him a "failed speical specimen" and Zero Two and Hiro could have gotten really close, so they had to wipe their memories. Maybe, cause they were trying to escape together, could explain the shackles in episode 1 that we see. However, Hiro's body could have adapted all this time and build up antibodies to be able to ride with Zero Two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I fully agree that it's suspicious that Zero Two knows this much, but I feel like suppressing traumatic memories would be hard. Since really bad memories rarely go away, that's why PTSD is so painful, because they bring the person back to the traumatic memory. The idea that he subconsciously can't acknowledge any other pilot would make a lot of sense though since Zero Two and Hiro could have made a promise that would only be partners. It wouldn't explain Zero Two, but my catch would be that they forced her to, since she was arguably more special than Hiro from APE's standpoint. Edit: changed couldn't to can't</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No worries, your English is good! Yeah, I could definitely see that, although if it was something special that did happen, which caused the Dr.Franxx to wipe their memories. What do you think the special thing was? My take would be that they both became super compatible which allowed to become insanely powerful, more than we #8217;ve seen. This worries APE that they wouldn #8217;t be able to control them anymore. But the flaw in my idea would be, if this happened then why would APE let them be together again.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Weekly Prediction Poll] Fan Theory Friday!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-02 21:34:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Everyone!  #160; I'd like to thank to everyone for all their awesome theories!!!  #160; I want to start this thread with an apology, I couldn't keep my word. I was extremely busy and couldn't post Aftermath Sunday (post where I analyze the results from Fan Theory Friday, as well as, Theory Collection Tuesday. Spring break is coming up for me, so all my classes are piling up [papers and tests](https://i.redd.it/zed9sj6gdug01.gif). Soo yeaa, I will try to prepare ahead of time, so I don't get consumed.  #160; Anyway who cares about that. Let's get straight to the predictions and theories!  #160; Here is the [**Weekly Prediction Poll**](http://poll.fm/5xa5q), same rules as last time. You can vote for as many theories, parts of theories or predictions you think will happen.  #160; Disclaimer: I realized something, so I saw that there a lot of theories that necessairly predict what will happen in the next episode, but predict what could happen in any given episode. So I will incorporate these theories, since they could be proven or disproven in the next episode, or they could not be mentioned at all. However, I want to try to incorporate all the predictions and theories I can :) Also, I have not included ever theory, since not all of them pertained to the next episode or could potentially pertain to the next episode.  #160; Here is a compilation of all the theories in no particular order:  #160; [**Theory: 002 has a name**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80bvqb/theory_002_has_a_name/) (by u/megumax): Basically, this theory talks about how if Hiro and Zero Two met in the past (which the author assumes to be the case), then there is large probability that Zero Two had a name and once  gt;if the  #8220;002 and Hiro met in the past #8221; theory is correct, then Hiro remembering her name will be an important late-game plot point. If they didn #8217;t meet in the past, then Hiro either learning her name or inventing one will be an important plot point. Also,  gt;002 is not the type to just stick to her code number, yet she does. Also, Hiro came up with the names for all the other plantation 13 kids. If he met 002 in the past, it #8217;s likely that he gave her a name as well. Perhaps that pause was her hoping he might remember it. This theory predicts something very crucial to Hiro's and Zero Two's relationship in the anime, therefore, we might not see evidence for it in the next episode. However, this series has surprised me more than once.  #160; [**Hiro's memory wiped theory expanded [Spoilers from Episode 7]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/803sc0/hiros_memory_wiped_theory_expanded_spoilers_from/) (by u/subject3031): So this my (shameless plug) theory, basically I provide more evidence that Hiro had his memory erased. What made me think this? The biggest give away, was the conversation between Ichigo and Hiro at the end of the episode. Ichigo says something along the lines of "so you haven't forgetten everything." However, these are authors that brought this theory to light at the beginning the first one is [The woman at the start of episode one, who she must be, and what we can see from it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wt8d3/the_woman_at_the_start_of_episode_one_who_she/) by u/AggressiveChairs and the second one called [Lets play the guessing game!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/7wyrs9/lets_play_the_guessing_game/) by u/Cyclopewarrior.  #160; [**Zero Two: Her Mysterious Tree, Why It's So Important, and Its Possible Location**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80grwg/zero_two_her_mysterious_tree_why_its_so_important/) (by u/DitFCodeAlpha): This theory talks about the mysterious tree and it's significance, but also where it could be and that part is very much related to the next episode "Grand Crevasse."  gt;Something very sad had happened to our #bestwaifu at the site of the white tree, and I believe this location could perhaps be the "Grand Crevasse" mentioned by Papa, who stated that Hiro's task now is to bring her there, and I am very excited to see what's going to transpire when that happens. I have heard several people stating that the "Grand Crevasse" is the "front lines" mentioned frequently throughout the series, and could very well be the origin point of every klaxosaur. also,  gt;I hope to see Hiro fighting on the front lines, perhaps along side the Nines and the other members of special forces!  #160; [**Where is the mysterious Grand Crevasse located? Find the answer right here!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80xype/where_is_the_mysterious_grand_crevasse_located/) (by u/Chemistry_Doge): Through an analysis on the name "Grand Crevasse" the author concludes  gt;Therefore, I can tell you with utmost confidence that the Grand Crevasse is located in the Gozenzawa Glacier near Mount Tateyama! I highly recommend reading the whole post if you haven't already, to get a grasp of the evidence.  #160; [**[Lehmann-class Fan Theory] Cracking the Orion code.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80bpht/lehmannclass_fan_theory_cracking_the_orion_code/) (by u/Zelda_2017): This theory talks about how since the show has a lot of bird and flower references (for FranXXs) and the author mentions how "Orion" is mentioned there is a lot of information I highly recommend reading it to get a better grasp as I scratched surface.  gt;The FranXX we've met so far are named after flowers and the common name of these flowers relate to birds... that was a nice original gimmick for the design, right? But as it turns out, this mechanism could work extremely well for the Nines as well!! Also, here are the authors predictions  gt;* This leads me to speculate the following... * When it is on Earth, the FranXX of squad 13 and the Nines are simple Flowers but when they take to the sky, they turn into Birds!! All members of Squad 13 will reach that level, because all characters will build strong relationships. Added: now that the correspondence between FranXX and birds has been adjusted and confirmed, I am convinced this will happen. * Zero Two's wish is to turn Strelizia into its Constellation!! That's why she says she must kill more Klaxosaurs. That also promises some even cooler finishing moves! * The design of the FranXX that the Nines pilot is more strongly based on birds... There may be even more powerful FranXX. * Finally, the naming system for the Nines is simply based on the Bayer designation. Each member receives a Greek letter. In this system, iota is in the 9th position...  #160; [**Theory: Dr FranXX is a former pilot**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80i2qa/theory_dr_franxx_is_a_former_pilot/) (by u/KinoAndCrabLegs): This theory predicts  gt;Regarding the Doctor's ominous comments about giving into Zero Two and other clues, I'm beginning to think that not only was he a former pilot, but 02's first partner. as well as,  gt;I think that all the Parasites have some form of klaxosaur DNA in them, and that Dr FranXX and 02 were among the first, hence their more obvious mutations. 02 has both horns, and the Doctor has a metal one on the masked side of his face. In Hiro this manifests itself as the Dino aids.  #160; [**Zero Two, the partner-killer**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/804s42/zero_two_the_partnerkiller/) (by u/Zhangalal): This theory talks about Zero Two's personality and what she expects from her partners, and how she thinks of people other than her [Darling](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/qtsueddr9f9unfak71ya.jpg).  gt;By partnering with Zero Two, the partners undergo near death circumstances and have to survive. If they survive and adapt, then they pass Zero Two's "test", and may be strong enough to be her partner. So apparently only Hiro survived three rides. What that means, is that Zero Two is fully willing to betray the squad. So maybe lots of deaths will arrive, considering the death flags in the last episode (beach episode). What Dr. Franxx means by "Don't let her consume your emotions", is possibly telling Hiro not to unconditionally fulfill Zero Two's wishes, as it could endanger his squad, and Zero Two might do something crazy or escape.  #160; [**[Spoiler]Early episode 8 predictions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80mb56/spoiler_early_episode_8_predictions/) (by u/TheIsolator): This theory predicts what will happen next episode.  gt;So what could happen: * We already know the next destination so will we get a timeskip like between episode 4 and 5? I don't think so but it's still a small possibility. * Zero Two and Ichigo will continue their talk/argument about kissing. Zero Two highly knows that Ichigo and Hiro kissed in episode 2 but she still wants to know who initiated the kiss and if Ichigo has feelings for Hiro. * Will Ichigo give it another try to serious talk with Hiro? * Hiro beginning to realize what the Dr. and Zero Two meant in episode 7, will he slowly taking the initiative to approach Zero Two with his true feelings? * Plantation 13 and Zero Two are now heavy monitored, will it put her under pressure? will she speed up her escape plan with Hiro? * Since she knows a lot about this society, will Zero Two begin to clear up some things with the plantation and sneak with Hiro into the inner city? * Kokoro's book, will she keep it to herself for now or share it with the others already? (the book is guaranteed to play an important role) * Next Kyoryuu attack? not sure about that since Strelizia is now really OP and only another Gutenberg or lots of Moro class Kyoryuu will be a true threat to the squad at the moment. * Mitsuru is still unstable. He seems to despise everyone who doesn't trust in Papa, will he even inform the higher ups if he suspects any disbelief? * Partner switch between Mitsuru/Ikuno and Futoshi/Kokoro happening soon?  #160; [**Ever wondered how long ago humanity has abandoned their old homes? Well, here is a possible theory!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80fu5g/ever_wondered_how_long_ago_humanity_has_abandoned/) (by u/Chemistry_Doge): This theory talks about the potential time frame when people were forced to abandon their homes.  gt;Therefore, humans could not have been living on the plantations for much longer than 20 or 30 years. This means that whatever catastrophic event forced the humans away from their old homes and into the plantations, must still be fresh in their memory.  #160; [**[SPOILER] 02/hiro summary for now**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/810360/spoiler_02hiro_summary_for_now/) (by u/Darliolin1221): This theory talks about the Zero Two relationship and condensing it very briefly it  gt;She(Zero Two) loves him, and now he has to prove it to him(Hiro). The reason I include this, is because the past few episodes, especially episode 7 talk about relationships. Even though there is ample evidence stating that Zero Two loves Hiro, this show has surprised us.  #160; [**[Spoiler] Dr.Franxx plan for a rebellion (updated)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/804430/spoiler_drfranxx_plan_for_a_rebellion_updated/) (by u/TheIsolator): This theory talks about how Dr. FranXX wants to influence the parasites of plantation 13 to create more human relationships and that Dr. Franxx wants Plantation to learn about past by sending the squad to the beach.  gt;So the meaning behind that the squad get know more about the old ones is cleary that they begin to doubt Papa. We see that already in Hiro's, Ikuno's and Kokoro's case who even found a book about babies. So his intent is not only that they should slowly begin to rethink their way of life but to awaken their feelings and emotions like I wrote in my older theory. So what is the reason for him to influence squad 13 to this extent? For me it's that they need to carry the compability rate and fighting power of their Franxx to a next level, something where Hiro and Zero Two already took the first step. A kiss seems to activate a huge power up of a Franxx which the doc of course knows about. His goal could be that all pairs of 13 not only show the resolve to rebel against Papa, they need to develop and show their honest feelings to their partners to release the true power of the Franxx to be able to fight against the regime (mainly the Nines what I think).  #160; [**APE's Plot: The Hidden Truth about the Abandoned City by the Beach**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80t0ii/apes_plot_the_hidden_truth_about_the_abandoned/) (by u/DitFCodeAlpha): This theory talks about Papa basically did something that convinced or forced people into plantations.  gt;I sense the fact that those books are lying there indicate that Papa imposed his will on his people that they were to forget all about basic human knowledge and instead become like the very things their children were to pilot: inanimate, identical robots. Papa, for some reason, decided to brainwash his subjects and separate parents from children. Interestingly enough, there is no sign of any parents seeking for their children, nor are there any adults, with the exception of those involved in the FranXX program or the sentinels/soldiers.  #160; [**How 002 knew about the old civilization? [Spoiler]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80merp/how_002_knew_about_the_old_civilization_spoiler/) (by u/chinchilla_lird): This post is actually a discussion, where the author asks the question. u/GTCvEnkai answered with  gt;Zero-two is shown to have significantly more knowledge about the world than any of the children, and given her interactions and general disposition to Dr. Franxx I believe Dr. Franxx gave her the knowledge and security clearance to explore them. and u/Zelda_2017 says  gt;That's probably because that's where she comes from... Next episode may reveal information on this, which is why I included this.  #160; [**APE's Plot: The Mystery Surrounding Nana's and Hachi's Names**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/819hic/apes_plot_the_mystery_surrounding_nanas_and/) (by u/DitFCodeAlpha): This theory predicts that Hiro could have potentially named his caretakers, since no one other than the parasites and caretakers from plantation 13 seem to have names.  gt;These adults, despite their names, appear to also have been parasites themselves, despite the fact that they are really called not by their presumed codes, but by names given to them by... Hiro?!?! This has really caught my attention, because besides Dr. Franxx himself, NOBODY outside of APE's High Council has names unless Hiro names them. Could it be possible that Hiro is about to have a huge plot twist on not only if he is related to Nine Alpha or if he has met (and named) Zero Two in the past, but also whether or not he actually named his own supervisors?  #160; [**APE #8217;s Plot: The Cursed Fate of the Adults**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80yehq/apes_plot_the_cursed_fate_of_the_adults/) (by u/DitFCodeAlpha): This theory talks about how Papa and APE are planning something devious.  gt;This is perhaps the reason that our #bestwaifu doesn #8217;t fight for Papa. She knows that something fishy is happening, and even though crap hasn #8217;t hit the fan yet, she knows what is going on behind the scenes: APE is definitely enslaving mankind for their own malicious agenda. That #8217;s why Zero Two calls Hiro #8217;s reasons  #8220;lame. #8221; In other words, they shouldn #8217;t be fighting klaxosaurs just because Papa said so. It could be because he created them in the first place.  #160; [**Episode 8 thoughts/theories**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarlingInTheFranxx/comments/80162c/episode_8_thoughtstheories/) (by u/Cheeriosos): I found this dicussion post, which contains some predictions in the comments. u/WackaChuck says  gt;I think some upcoming drama with Zerotwo and Ichigo will ensue through out upcoming episodes, probably not as the main focus, but as a underlying plot. u/Zelda_2017 says  gt;Battle at sea. And yes, I do have a wacky theory to support this. -- gt; Klaxosaurs are earthquakes. We've only seen Klax on land, but earthquakes also happen in the sea and become tsunamis... Flashbacks of 3.11... u/TheIsolator says  gt;Next destination is the grand crevasse so question is will we get 1 or 2 episodes before that with more characterization, world building and perhaps another klaxo battle or will it be a timeskip like they did before the plantation kissing. u/tomoko2015 says  gt;I suspect one of two things will happen, both of which will end up in relationship problems between Hiro and 02: * 02 will do something which Hiro does not approve of (after all, she only really cares about Hiro, not about the others, so there could be some kind of conflict when she refuses to help out the others) * 02 finds out that Hiro kissed Ichigo or sees them together (usual romcom misunderstanding) and she gets super jealous / super pissed at Hiro  #160; Sorry, this took so long to put out. I tried to get it down before class, but with only 1 hour I was only able to a little more than a third down :'( . Therefore, I had to wait until my classes were over.  #160; I'm always looking for a way to improve this post, whether it be less quoted text, less of comments, less theories, more theories, and so on. Please tell!!  #160; Super excited to see this next episode as always.  #160; Thanks for reading and participating!!!!!!  #160; Everyone have a Great Day!!  #160; I might go take a nap now :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Recently got into Romance/Dramas looking for more sad/dark ones</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-20 07:14:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello :) So my friend got me into romance/drama series. My friend first showed me series like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Plastic Memories, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (still watching), Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone (still watching), then I watched the Chunnibyo series. Then he showed me School Days, and then I watched Myself; Yourself. While I enjoyed watching and enjoy watching each of these shows. I recently took a liking to the more darker and sad ones like the last two I mentioned school days and myself; yourself. The current ones that I saw/researched a little that were similar are ef: A Tale of Memories, Golden Time, H2O: Footprints in the Sand, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien and True Tears. What would you all recommend I watch? Any help is greatly appreciate! Thank you for your time!

    <TITLE>Finished the Anime thoughts and questions (with spoiler question about LNs)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-03 12:03:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I just the finished the anime, and damnnn. I haven't watched an anime like that for a long time. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the Chtholly and Willhelm relationship I thought it was really well done. It did get kinda confusing at the end, where Willhelm's past self-said he wasn't doing it for Chtholly but for Lillia. I assume he still chose Chtholly. I got really interested in what happened to both of them (Willhelm and Chtholly) at first I thought that was it. They both are gone, for Chtholly it would be basically impossible to come back since her memories and her wholeself would be disintegrated. Willhelm could have a survived I thought. THEN I saw that there was more material. So I read some of the posts about the synopsis of the books. However, I still have so many questions. Here are my questions: If I get something wrong or my question doesn't make sense, please correct me I only read the synopsis in the other posts and memory is also really bad. 1). Why does it seem like on Chtholly is the only one suffering from memory disintegration? I know that at the end of the anime Nephren also gets the red eyes and stuff, but from what I read in the other posts she is fine. 2). So the reason the visitors (which are like gods, right?) came is that they saw that humanity would wipe itself out. But then didn't the very act of them coming cause humanity to wipe themselves out because of the creation of the beasts in self-defense? 3). In the anime, Souwong doesn't tell Willhelm the truth about the beasts, because he said he would hate him for it and then Willhelm figures out that the beasts are humans. Since Souwong created the fairies, was he the one to create the beasts? 4). Who is Elq exactly? 5). Why did Elq sort of help and sort of not help Chtholly. What I mean by this is Elq let Chtholly come back a couple of times, but didn't she let Chtholly stay forever? Also, is Chtholly's body used as a vessel for Elq? 6). This what I want to know most What happens to Willhelm and Chtholly in the very end. Do they ever meet again? I know in the anime we see a baby (Chtholly reincarnated I presume) and I heard from the LN synopsis that Wilhelm is comatose and turns half beast? And then I heard that in the LN that is her? Is it her? Do they meet up? What happens? 7). Last sort of unrelated question what anime did you guys watch that you would say is similar to this? Thanks for reading! Thanks in Advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I gotcha. Ideally I #8217;d like to read the light novels, but I feel that they would take me a long time to finish since I am quite a slow reader. Which isn #8217;t a good excuse by any means, but because of that I never really got into reading stuff. But I #8217;ll give it a shot. If you are still willing to answer the questions I would be very grateful!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This series is really insane, one of the most tear inducing anime I have watched. I also really hope for a season 2, is there any news or way that a season 2 will happen or is it too late? That is so crazy to me that the humans were originally beasts, which makes me wonder why the other races and Wilhem himself didn't revert. That is actually insane. How long out of curisoity did it take you to read sukasuka and sukamoka? I actually did start reading the light novels, I became the first book yesterday and I am 1/3 in. Only thing that confuses is that the names are different for some of the characters. Not going to lie haven't cried for a series like I did for sukasuka. I actually did watch both plastic memories and Angel beats :( thank you for the recommendations though :) I actually don't understand why this series isn't more popular, it really needs to be. It is abosolutely amazing. Thank you so much for answering everything and more!</TEXT>

So what if she didn #8217;t fight and ended up using that dug weapon. I was just trying to think of an ending where they both would have survived.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello :) So over the past few months I've been testing many genres out, but the ones I've been looking for are ones that have a action/adventure/journey plot to them, with a focus on character relationships with dark endings. The last 3 animes I watched were WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?, Guilty Crown and I am about to finish Zetsuen no Tempest. Thank you for reading!

    <TEXT>Hello, So I played monster hunter way back on psp (Monster Hunter Freedom unite) and I always wanted to defeat these dragons. I was never able to. My question is if I could theoretrically beat these dragons at my stage in the game. I just beat Barroth. And my gear is a full Pukei-Pukei armor set and a kulu blade I. Is it possible for me to beat one or both of these dragons with my gear solo? Or would it just too long or is it just impossible? Any help is greatly appreciated!! Edit 1: Thank you so much for all the help!! You guys are awesome!!!</TEXT>
