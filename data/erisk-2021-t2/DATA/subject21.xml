    <TEXT>In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hinata Von Der Kat is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years, and continues to do so throughout the quarantine. At the moment, she is struggling to keep up with the cost of their care, including food and medical bills. She takes care of over 250 street cats and dogs, and fosters 30 handicapped cats in her own home. Most of which are either blind cats or orphaned kittens. Hinata works hard to make sure as many animals as possible receive food, medical treatment (including spay and neuter), and protection. A little can go a long way, so please give whatever you can. I have started a gofundme to raise money to help her provide for these animals: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/moroccan-cats-and-dogs?utm\_source=customer amp;utm\_medium=copy\_link-tip amp;utm\_campaign=p\_cp%20share-sheet amp;fbclid=IwAR2UK27\_kkCuUfYwo34mQQssCBiy5nuwWiPTJopcKvJ29iR7kFfBSxjDSk8](https://www.gofundme.com/f/moroccan-cats-and-dogs?utm_source=customer amp;utm_medium=copy_link-tip amp;utm_campaign=p_cp%20share-sheet amp;fbclid=IwAR2UK27_kkCuUfYwo34mQQssCBiy5nuwWiPTJopcKvJ29iR7kFfBSxjDSk8) For more information and to keep up with her efforts, you can find her Facebook page here: [https://www.facebook.com/hajar.ben.3975/timeline?lst=715374255%3A747948774%3A1590839514](https://www.facebook.com/hajar.ben.3975/timeline?lst=715374255%3A747948774%3A1590839514)</TEXT>

However, if this post can convince those who have the means to give when they normally would not, that would be nice. At the very least, I would hope seeing this post would remind people to be kind to animals they may see on the street. If you are looking to donate to helping humans of Morocco, here is the link to a reputable charity dedicated to the cause: [https://www.crisisaid.org.uk/morocco/](https://www.crisisaid.org.uk/morocco/) Alternatively, if you have suggestions for other charities in need, please reply to those asking in the comments or create a post of your own.  #8203; I would also like to add that Hinata is a human and she is struggling. This fundraiser is not only about the animals, but about helping someone who does so much to care for others. So, even if you do not agree with our cause, I would ask that you please be kind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I appreciate your concern for human welfare. Yes, humanity needs help. I am not meaning to take away from them. I do not wish for someone to spend money on these animals that they would normally spend helping humans. However, if this post can convince those who have the means to give when they normally would not, that would be nice. At the very least, I would hope seeing this post would remind people to be kind to animals they may see on the street. Blind cats and cats with three legs can live a perfectly normal life indoors. It is quite common. They deserve the same chance at life as those animals who are not handicapped. Wishing you the best and sorry for any offense caused.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Antibiotics for Moroccan Strays</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 12:16:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hajar Benallal (AKA Hinata Von Der Kat) is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years, and continues to do so throughout the quarantine. Hajar works hard every day to make sure as many animals as possible receive food, medical treatment (including spay and neuter), and protection. She takes care of over 350 street cats and dogs, and fosters 30 cats in her own home. Most of which are either handicapped, blind cats, or orphaned kittens. At the moment, an outbreak of cat flu has occurred throughout a number of the foster cats and kittens. The antibiotics necessary to treat this outbreak will cost  #163;90. If you are familiar with Morocco, you may know that often times veterinary medications are not readily available as they are in western countries. While Hajar regularly takes her cats to the vet for treatment, it was not until very recently that the antibiotics were available for purchase from the lab. Consequently, the illness in these cats has steadily progressed to severe stages. As cat flu is extremely contagious, the afflicted cats are currently being separated from the other cats in the household. These sick cats are receiving the best care Hajar can possibly provide for them, with the hopes of giving their immune systems what they need to keep fighting. However, in the long run, this will not be enough to save them. At the stage of illness some of these cats are in, their futures are grim without treatment. If you can give, anything helps. Thank you for listening!

    <TITLE>Antibiotics for shelter cats</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-24 19:46:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hajar Benallal (AKA Hinata Von Der Kat on Facebook) is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years, and continues to do so throughout the quarantine. Hajar works hard every day to make sure as many animals as possible receive food, medical treatment (including spay and neuter), and protection. She takes care of over 350 street cats and dogs, and fosters 30 cats in her own home. Most of which are either handicapped, blind cats, or orphaned kittens. At the moment, an outbreak of cat flu has occurred throughout a number of the foster cats and kittens. The antibiotics necessary to treat this outbreak will cost  #163;90. If you are familiar with Morocco, you may know that often times veterinary medications are not readily available as they are in western countries. While Hajar regularly takes her cats to the vet for treatment, it was not until very recently that the antibiotics were available for purchase from the lab. Consequently, the illness in these cats has steadily progressed to severe stages. As cat flu is extremely contagious, the afflicted cats are currently being separated from the other cats in the household. These sick cats are receiving the best care Hajar can possibly provide for them, with the hopes of giving their immune systems what they need to keep fighting. However, in the long run, this will not be enough to save them. At the stage of illness some of these cats are in, their futures are grim without treatment. If you can give, anything helps. Thank you for listening!

    <TEXT>Hiya, A good friend of mine was diagnosed with crohn's years ago and had major issues, having had to have surgery to remove intestine. Eventually, he switched to a vegan diet and he says it has really helped him overcome the disease. He is very vocal about it and likes to help others so maybe I could put you guys in touch?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys. I know that I have posted in this subreddit quite a bit and I'm so sorry if you find this kind of thing annoying. That being said, I have found some of the best people here and am trying to reach out to others. Also, this post is a bit different from the rest. In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hajar Benallal (AKA Hinata Von Der Kat) is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years, and continues to do so throughout the quarantine. Currently, she has encountered a few emergency cases that we are trying to raise money for. The treatments are going to be expensive, and we do not have the money to afford any of it at the moment. Two of the animals are already at the vet receiving treatment, with a bill coming soon. The other two animals have not received treatment of any kind, and will not be able to until the funds are raised. Any contribution helps, and 100% will go towards the cost of the medical care. For more details on the specific animals and their cases, please visit the [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-medical-care-for-stray-amp-shelter-animals) For more information on Hajar, please visit her [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hajar.ben.3975) Or, there are additional videos of her work and links to articles on the [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-medical-care-for-stray-amp-shelter-animals) page I'll attach some photos of what we're dealing with below.

    <TEXT>I think it really depends on the age of the kitten and if the kitten was raised with other kittens. We got my kittens when they were about 4 months old, and they had been raised together since they were just a few weeks old. Because they played together, they taught each other what kind of play is too rough. They really couldn't be more gentle when they do claw or bite ( I know this because my hand is sometimes the victim). When we introduced them to my adult cat, my adult cat did react with a lot of sass at first. The kittens, being smaller and the newbies, were more submissive and didn't really retaliate. If they did, it was quite gentle. Over a bit of time, they did start to get along better and neither of them even use their claws if they do get in a little fight. It's more of a slap with the paw. I think a kitten is actually the best bet because they are naturally friendlier and more playful. An adult cat is more likely to act with aggression during the introduction that would result in an injury for your declawed girl. Once the kitten and the adult become friends or at least learn to tolerate each other, fighting won't be a concern really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I've heard, animals do not last long in LA shelters (around 3 days). Any shelter should be able to check the microchip database for you and contact the owner. But, I would be hesitant to leave the cat with the shelter in the meantime. Maybe it could stay with a friend until you figure it out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys. I promise this will be the last time I post about this cause (I've posted it here once before). I also sincerely apologize if you find this kind of thing annoying. We're just really looking for a bit more help. I've tried everywhere to spread the word about our cause, but vegan reddit seems to be the only place that really listens. So, thank you for that! In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hajar Benallal (AKA Hinata Von Der Kat on Facebook) is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years, and continues to do so throughout the quarantine. Hajar works hard every day to make sure as many animals as possible receive food, medical treatment (including spay and neuter), and protection. Recently, she had a few emergency cases that we've been trying to raise money to treat. We've been able to accomplish a lot with what we've raised so far, but we still have a little bit further to go to make sure we can save these animal's lives and continue to save others in the future. I will tell you a bit about the cases and what we have accomplished so far below. For more information or to help out, please check out the [GoFundMe](https://gf.me/u/ycbvkb). Or, you can check out Hajar and her daily updates on what she does at her [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hajar.ben.3975) page. Case 1: A shepherd mix stray who is just under one year old has rapidly developed an extremely large mass in her throat. She is normally very friendly, food motivated, and active, but has since become lethargic and can barely eat. After vet consultation, we have started treatment with antibiotics and steroids. She has started to show improvements, still requires more medication to fully recover. Fortunately, we have raised the current amount of funds required to sustain this treatment. Her before: https://preview.redd.it/cmrk9r11i9951.jpg?width=720 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=532b0728855a037cd4c4f4861feacb317bedcfcd The mass: https://preview.redd.it/92x3iv03i9951.jpg?width=720 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=4c50cf4dfd90b9c3f9059ce95503656f984d16a9 At the vet: https://preview.redd.it/cmdyxd4gi9951.jpg?width=960 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=2717f4132607f7a697103c3fa9dce40274ccc9ad Case 2: This stray was found on the brink of death and struggling to breathe. It took a few days to find transport to the vet and we were very worried he would not make it. Hajar was eventually able to get him there, and he has been in ICU to treat severe pneumonia for the past few weeks. He has been fighting very hard and is finally starting to show major improvements. However, he still needs surgery to repair his broken femur. He has made it so far and still has a long way to go, but with your help he can do it! He also doesn't have a name yet so if you need more motivation to donate we will absolutely let you name him in return. A video I made detailing his journey: https://reddit.com/link/hmauq2/video/0yqdr2k2j9951/player Case 3: Kika is a 10 year old terrier mix. While not technically a stray, she is still one of the many dogs Hajar cares for on a daily basis. Kika belongs to an elderly man in Rabat who works for a local restaurant in exchange for a roof over his head. She was adopted by the man around 5 years ago, after he rescued her from her previous owner who was mistreating her. Kika has long been in need of an operation to remove a large inguinal hernia. It is our hope that this operation will allow Kika to continue living a long and healthy life with her best buddy. Thankfully, we have raised enough funds to schedule the operation, and it is actually happening today! I will post updates once she is recovered :) https://preview.redd.it/c8bqlz5jj9951.jpg?width=527 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=c2975334a27b8d90b27b52f9eb8baad860c62699 https://preview.redd.it/h9q7s16jj9951.jpg?width=960 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=7a10b4e19ff7d9c766b4c984c6ef845d9a90ed86 https://preview.redd.it/9ua2u26jj9951.jpg?width=960 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=ca8e71f645db6ac9d152ad613a9c2ef64ea1070b Case 4: Butter is one of the cat's in Hajar's foster house. She is suffering from a severe case of pneumonia as a result of cat flu.

    <TEXT>Hi guys. I promise this will be the last time I post about this cause (I've posted it here once before). I also sincerely apologize if you find this kind of thing annoying. We're just really looking for a bit more help. I've tried everywhere to spread the word about our cause, but vegan reddit seems to be the only place that really listens. So, thank you for that! In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hajar Benallal (AKA Hinata Von Der Kat on Facebook) is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years, and continues to do so throughout the quarantine. Hajar works hard every day to make sure as many animals as possible receive food, medical treatment (including spay and neuter), and protection. Recently, she had a few emergency cases that we've been trying to raise money to treat. We've been able to accomplish a lot with what we've raised so far, but we still have a little bit further to go to make sure we can save these animal's lives and continue to save others in the future. I will tell you a bit about the cases and what we have accomplished so far below. For more information or to help out, please check out the [GoFundMe](https://gf.me/u/ycbvkb). Or, you can check out Hajar and her daily updates on what she does at her [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hajar.ben.3975) page. Case 1: A shepherd mix stray who is just under one year old has rapidly developed an extremely large mass in her throat. She is normally very friendly, food motivated, and active, but has since become lethargic and can barely eat. After vet consultation, we have started treatment with antibiotics and steroids. She has started to show improvements, still requires more medication to fully recover. Fortunately, we have raised the current amount of funds required to sustain this treatment. Her before: https://preview.redd.it/zrnaooewk9951.jpg?width=720 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=ad3d9ed0d691e4d74b7a5afd7ea7ea3f05c37cdc The mass: https://preview.redd.it/pr7d8b4xk9951.jpg?width=720 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=6b78b9c6200a4cd3d8d9626a6253c9701462eb95 At the vet: https://preview.redd.it/nadgac7yk9951.jpg?width=960 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=82be33427dc4b464515fbc8f57c3b5854eb254da Case 2: This stray was found on the brink of death and struggling to breathe. It took a few days to find transport to the vet and we were very worried he would not make it. Hajar was eventually able to get him there, and he has been in ICU to treat severe pneumonia for the past few weeks. He has been fighting very hard and is finally starting to show major improvements. However, he still needs surgery to repair his broken femur. He has made it so far and still has a long way to go, but with your help he can do it! He also doesn't have a name yet so if you need more motivation to donate we will absolutely let you name him in return. A video I made detailing his journey: https://reddit.com/link/hmayw3/video/8fi5pqj2l9951/player Case 3: Kika is a 10 year old terrier mix. While not technically a stray, she is still one of the many dogs Hajar cares for on a daily basis. Kika belongs to an elderly man in Rabat who works for a local restaurant in exchange for a roof over his head. She was adopted by the man around 5 years ago, after he rescued her from her previous owner who was mistreating her. Kika has long been in need of an operation to remove a large inguinal hernia. It is our hope that this operation will allow Kika to continue living a long and healthy life with her best buddy. Thankfully, we have raised enough funds to schedule the operation, and it is actually happening today! I will post updates once she is recovered :) https://preview.redd.it/5uf8g6j7l9951.jpg?width=528 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=117a98f5abadba36011eb8a2ca6a310c6c2a93d0 https://preview.redd.it/7kqrn9j7l9951.jpg?width=960 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=3fa7c37420a2bd534cfedf577843176fe287cf7f https://preview.redd.it/am2mi8j7l9951.jpg?width=960 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=3d1b511f0f55e13a7701c84f04fa3dcbc3b26bed Case 4: Butter is one of the cat's in Hajar's foster house.

    <TEXT>Hi, thank you for the well wishes. We spay and neuter all the animals that we can. Unfortunately, we don #8217;t have the means to sterilize the entire city #8217;s population. We do work with a vet who bends over backwards for us and gives us good rates, but outside of that there are no other options. Morocco doesn #8217;t have the veterinary communities that you might be used to in other countries. That #8217;s why we are asking for outside help, because there is no help there. I am a veterinary student from the USA who has been helping Hajar raise money because I see how hard she works and I am passionate about her cause. It is astonishing how little organizations care about animals over there. But, there are good hearted individuals trying their best to make a difference.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Animal shelter construction  amp; food supplies</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-15 13:26:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Moroccan city of Rabat, a woman named Hajar Benallal (AKA Hinata Von Der Kat on Facebook) is working mostly alone to care for the city's stray cats and dogs. She has been caring for them for the past ten years and has dedicated her entire life to improving theirs. Hinata works hard to make sure as many animals as possible receive food, medical treatment (including spay and neuter), and protection. Recently, donations have drastically slowed down. Not long ago, we put together a few successful fundraisers to pay for the medical treatment of emergency cases. We are immensely thankful for all of the support we received to help those animals, but unfortunately, outside of that, we are struggling to make the rest of the ends meet. Right now, we would like to focus on getting the animals in our shelter (AKA  #8220;the foster house #8221;) to the best position possible for them to be cared for and adopted out efficiently. As you may know from our previous fundraiser, we recently moved locations in order to both expand so more animals could be taken off the streets, as well as to allow for better separation between animals in recovery and those that are healthy and adoptable. This was a great start, as we now have the space available to begin constructing a much more suitable shelter. However, the space still requires alterations which we had planned on gradually completing as the funds required became available. Unfortunately, due to recent events, finishing this construction has become much more urgent. Recently, the stray dogs in Rabat have fallen victim to a number of extermination attempts via poison. These attacks wiped out an entire colony of approximately 35 friendly adult dogs and puppies. Of the deceased was Linda, an elderly lab mix whom Hajar had been caring for for the past 10 years. There was only one survivor (who currently needs a foster home or safe space in Morocco, so if interested please let us know). We are worried these attacks will be directed at the cats next. In response, we are trying to keep as many off the streets as possible. Especially those that are more trusting of humans and thus more likely to fall victim to any attack. At the moment, we just do not have the space available to take any more in, as we are not finished with construction. 100% of the donations towards this [GoFundMe](https://gf.me/u/ygk3ab) (besides the percentage GoFundMe itself takes) will go towards caring for the animals. Because we are also in desperate need of food for both the stray and shelter cats and dogs, as well as litter, we will be dividing up the costs between those supplies and construction supplies as needed. Here is a breakdown of what is needed financially:  #183; #160; #160; #160; #160; #160; #160;To complete the construction of the shelter and allow for safe housing of our current foster cats and any future cats, we need around **800 GBP**. Specifically, we are creating divisions between available rooms to allow for adequate separation of sick and healthy cats, as well as to provide safe spaces for nursing mothers, and injured/handicapped cats. Moreover, we are working to secure the rooftop terrace so that we may utilize it for additional cat housing.  #183; #160; #160; #160; #160; #160; #160;We are also in desperate need of food for both the stray and shelter cats and dogs, as well as litter for the shelter cats. We care for approximately 250 stray cats and dogs, and currently house 29 cats and kittens in the shelter. It costs approximately **20 GBP** per day to provide for all these animals (outside of medication costs). We are aiming for around **200 GBP** to allocate towards these costs. For more information on Hajar and her work, please visit the [GoFundMe](https://gf.me/u/ygk3ab). That is where we are accepting donations to this cause. Thank you so much for listening :) Here is a video illustrating the sheer number of animals we care for. You can find more photos and evidence of the mass euthanasia of our dog colony on the [GoFundMe](https://gf.me/u/ygk3ab) as well.  #8203; https://reddit.com/link/hrnib7/video/nv8xbkzpv0b51/player</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have just a few: Changing food from the type the shelter fed the cat to the new type you bought will probably give the cat diarrhea for a few days. If you can, buy some of the same type as the shelter and gradually add more and more of your preferred type to the old type over time. This should prevent stomach issues. It could take around 6 months for the cat's true personality to come out after you adopt it, so be patient! If you have house plants, check online to make sure they're not toxic to cats because your cat might want to chew on them. They make cat-proof netting for balconies so that your cat will stay safe while enjoying the outside :) The energy of a puppy might be overwhelming to the cat. There's lots of valuable resources online that will give you step by step advice on that kind of introduction. I just introduced my two cats with two new cats, and it took a very long time for them to start getting along. So be patient with that also!  #8203; and congratulations on your new family member!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Put her down??? I would say the worst-case scenario is finding her a home where she could be the only cat. Another option would be to keep her in a room separate from the other cats in the house. Her having her own space might reduce her need to feel territorial or food threatened. However, this could impact her quality of life since it's just a small space. If you were planning on moving out on your own in the future though and it's just a temporary solution then not a big deal. Sometimes cats just don't get along like how some people just don't get along. There are plenty of cats in shelters that I have worked for that absolutely have to be homed without other animals. It's not that uncommon. However, I do think the best thing to do would be to immediately separate the cats, for everyone's sake. At her core, your cat is just being defensive. She might feel like she needs to compete for resources and is afraid. I think your humane society is very harsh saying that she deserves to lose her life over it. The vet clinic I used to work for sold CBD, like mentioned in the other comment. I've never used it for my own pets, but I have heard people say great things about it for anxiety. There are also pheromone pet sprays that I have had success with as well. I think you can get those sprays on Amazon. Overall, explore your options. Separate the animals. Don't give up on your cat :)  #8203; Wishing you the best of luck.</TEXT>

The bottom line is somebody needs to get involved. These cats are going to suffer so much if they're left to just keep breeding on the property. If it were me, I would go feed the pregnant one and take her. Then once you have her, call the rescue group and arrange a time when you can drop her off (or call first, whatever works best for you). I would also speak with them about the situation. If they aren't willing to get involved then honestly I would rinse and repeat the previous steps with the next cat. It seems a little sketchy to do it that way but when so many lives are at risk it's worth it. Good luck  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you tried the tinfoil method? Some cats absolutely can't stand the feel or sound of it so if you put it on the spot she pees it might deter her. You could remove it after a while when she learns to go somewhere else. I've had this work with most of my cats, but one of my current cats actually loves the tinfoil instead. Have you also tried putting her litter box in the spot for a while to re-teach her where to go? Then you would slowly inch by inch move the litter box each day away to the spot you want it permanently. Just some other ideas: I have three types of litter boxes. The normal just tray, a walk in hooded one, and a top entry one. Each of my cats prefers a specific one over the other, so maybe your cat would like a different type of box? Lastly, maybe she would like a different type of litter? One of my cats will only use a super fine sand-like litter because it's softer on her feet. Maybe worth a shot. I also have to make sure her box is super clean at all times or she'll poop right next to it instead.  #8203; Good luck. I know how frustrating spraying can be but I hope you figure it out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Connecting a Panasonic Lumix TZ90 to OBS</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-27 12:21:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I have a Panasonic Lumix TZ90 that I want to connect to OBS. I've connected it to my computer via micro HDMI and this capture card: [https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08F76C8S8/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o02\_s01?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08F76C8S8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1) Currently, I can only get the playback setting to show on OBS. When I switch the camera to any capture mode, it black screens on OBS. Additionally, when I do switch the camera to playback, an alert shows on the camera's interface telling me it's broadcasting to the TV, but this goes away on the capture settings. I'm not sure if it's even possible with this camera honestly, but before I give up I wanted to check with people more tech savvy than myself. Though, I was told prior to this ordeal that if the camera had an hdmi output (like mine does), then it was possible. I am aware there is a beta software that allows streaming with Lumix, but as far as I know my camera is not compatible. Also, super sorry if this doesn't make sense or was confusing. I don't necessarily know what I'm talking about but I'm trying my best :) Thank you for any and all advice!</TEXT>

I know that Missouri has a big issue with full shelters, but try contacting lab rescues like this one [https://lab.rescueme.org/Missouri](https://lab.rescueme.org/Missouri) Even if they can't take him in, they will try to help you. Here is another one that specializes in rehabilitating labs [http://www.heartlandlabrescue.com/about/](http://www.heartlandlabrescue.com/about/) \^\^ They are located in Kansas and Oklahoma but maybe they would be willing to make the trip? and another: [https://mlrr.org/?fbclid=IwAR0qGNbyZiwExBLEWWYd4Ve7CHzwp\_NOYeEuopKgYAP7JiPx3x7gIhkuSPc](https://mlrr.org/?fbclid=IwAR0qGNbyZiwExBLEWWYd4Ve7CHzwp_NOYeEuopKgYAP7JiPx3x7gIhkuSPc) Finally, I would try reaching out to any local humane societies or animal shelters near you (not government shelters because of your dog's temperament, it would be a death sentence). The order I would do this in is: lab rescues first, then local shelters, then the Facebook group. I know you're pressed for time but don't give up just yet! There is hope for your boy and a home where he can be safe. We just need to find it. Please keep me updated. Goodluck!  #8203; Oh also, maybe take a few more pictures!

He doesn't have his mama or siblings to warm him, so it's important to be mindful of the room temperature. Definitely take him in or else he won't last long. Second, you should offer him some kitten milk replacer, such as KMR. You should be able to get that at a pet store I think, or definitely on Amazon. I think if he just opened his eyes he'll need that stuff for the next two weeks. Time is definitely of the essence in these situations, but if you act fast the little guy can make it.

    <TEXT>Do you have yogurt or anything?? I think mixing the almond milk with the baby food would be your best bet if you have no other options. If you can, the little guy will probably need to be fed with a syringe I think? Very slowly to prevent anything from getting into his lungs. Here are some recipes for DIY kitten formula. I would pick whatever you have the most ingredients of and make that. Even if there is a few missing ingredients, see if the little fella will take it? [https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-supplement-formula-552272](https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-supplement-formula-552272) Did he take the baby food or almond milk? Also is the almost milk sweetened? He/she will need the sugar so if it is not sweetened you should add some sugar to it. You might see if he gets sugar in him he'll liven up a bit. Additionally, make sure you feed it warmed. If you put a drop or two on your inner elbow or underside of your wrist you should almost not feel it. That's how you know it's the perfect temp. The mouse also needs to be very warm before you feed or else he can't digest the food and it will cause problems. I mean like heating pad under his enclosure warm. Even just being out from under the blanket for too long could be a problem. PS. Once you get the kitten milk, I would just stick with that over the DIY stuff even if you did have all the ingredients. It's just a safer bet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could be that she's the one over protective of you. So long as your dog isn't growling or acting violently defensive in some manner, I think it's not that big of a deal. However, I do think your sister should do some bonding with her. Like, taking her for walks and giving her treats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something else you could do is experiment with the type of litter you're using in your litter boxes, as well as the number of litter boxes you have, the types of litter boxes you have, and the location of these boxes. I've had two cats that will refuse to go on certain types of litters for whatever reason, each with different type preferences. One of them hated the wood pellets, and the other will only use very fine micro litter. Additionally, I keep three types of litter boxes in my house: the normal tray, the front entry covered one, and the top entry covered one. Each of my cats has their preference to which one they like to use. One of my cats will only use the normal tray, but only if it's in a certain spot in the bathroom. If it's anywhere else, she'll just go in the spot where she wants the litter box to be. Oh yeah, I also clean the boxes every day. If not, two of them will hold it until they're cleaned. Just something else to keep in mind.</TEXT>

I wanted to share that website with you all today so that you can see the work that we do everyday. If you are interested, please go check it out: www.crazycatladyrescues.com I posted in here a while back asking for help with raising money for the street cats and dogs of Rabat. I have learned from then and want to make sure to include human charities in the original post as well.

    <TEXT>How long ago did you adopt them? If your food is different to what they were getting at their previous place, then that would probably explain the diarrhea. Their bellies are getting acclimated is all. Once the diarrhea clears up, the stool tracking should as well. But remember they are babies and are clumsy still. I don't think the litter box size should be causing you any problems at the moment. Maybe the enclosed top is making them nervous? You could try popping the lid off if you think it would help them? There are also mats that you can put outside the litter box that help catch the litter so it doesn't track all over the house. Unfortunately, sometimes that area of your house is destined to be plagued by rogue litter (like mine).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no idea if those worms could cause intestinal parasites but I think it is unlikely. You would need to monitor your dog's poop to make sure there is none coming out with the stool, as well as making sure your dog does not start getting diarrhea. As for the food, try feeding your dog in a different area like the bathroom for now and removing the food when your dog is done. Flies will lay eggs in all kinds of things. Plant soil is a common one. So make sure you are looking for where they are hatching from so you can address the source of the problem. I find it really weird that you would have worms in the food so quickly. Are you sure the food itself is still good? Are you changing it regularly?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your interest! You would go on the website and find a cat you are interested in, then contact us for an adoption form. If it is a good match we would then begin to prepare the steps necessary on our end for the cat to travel. This includes veterinary paperwork and specific vaccines. Normally, state government requires a post-vaccine waiting period of 3 months before the cat can travel. Once this is up, then the cat is ready to fly to your chosen destination :) Our adoption fee covers only what the cost of the paperwork and vaccines would be which is 250 euros. Moreover, the adopter would be responsible for the animal's flight cost. The cost of this can vary significantly depending on the route of travel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I volunteer with a non-profit in Morocco that provides medical treatment, spay  amp; neuter, food, shelter, and re-homing for the city's stray cats and dogs. Our efforts have been displayed on Facebook for years, but all summer long (and now well into fall) we worked hard on creating a website to help get the word of our cause of there. Now, you can finally learn the stories and the personalities of a lot of the individual animals we care for! Our hope is that this website will encourage more international adoptions. Additionally, we hope that the website will also encourage more donations (we, like most of the world, have been seriously struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic). It would mean the world to me and the animals if you would check it out. Any feedback is appreciated :) [Visit the website here!](https://www.crazycatladyrescues.com/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Along with the other comments, the little guy might be lonely. I would contact the shelter and tell them that you have a potential adopter. I am certain they would be willing to work with you on it. The bottom line is, you sound like you don't want to keep the kitten anymore which is perfectly fine. The both of you would be much happier if he was with a home that had more time and energy to care for him. As someone who has worked for many shelters, I can tell you that while yes we hope you foster fail, we would rather you foster fail only if you want to. Sometimes it's just not a perfect match. You did a good thing by saving the little guy in the first place and I think you can pass the baton now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could try calling animal control but they may not do anything. Depending on where you live, that might also be a death sentence. Some other options are to go to the house every day and care for the dog yourself, try and buy the dog off your aunt, or just straight up take the dog from her and hope that she forgives you because you're family. Maybe even offer to take the dog on the weekends or something and hope that she sees how much happier the dog is with someone else and will be willing to part with her? I think the bottom line is that the dog needs to be rescued and quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know it's hard to see your older cat disappointed that he is no longer an only child. However, a month is just not long enough of an adjustment period. Honestly, at shelters we usually tell people it takes around 6 months for both your new kitten and your older cat to get acclimated to the change. I like your idea of keeping a safe space for your OG cat. He may seem less playful, but just keep playing with him in his safe space and you'll see that he is hopefully still the same playful guy. It's alright that they use the same litter box and share food. Your OG is allowed to assert himself. You only don't want him to eat too much kitten food because it might make him put on the pounds. It's going to take him, but they should reach a place of at least mutual respect and normalcy (or even become good friends). My fingers are crossed that the process hurries up for you guys, but don't be surprised if it takes its sweet time. All you can do in the meantime is make sure your boy feels loved.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they don't want to be outside then absolutely don't make them. I can imagine that would only make the situation worse. That's quite odd. Honestly, I might consult a different vet. Clearly something is wrong and the steroid isn't working. The only advice besides that I have to offer is a pheromone spray if you feel she is stressed. My cats respond quite well to them during travel. I think they are available on Amazon? If it is an allergy, it could be a number of things. I had a cat who was very sensitive to different types of litters, especially any wood based litter. I have a cat now who will only accept micro litters. Maybe you could try experimenting? Additionally, you could try switching her to an allergy food and see how that works.  #8203; Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aww. You could show the OG the bathroom is safe again by giving him lots of treats in there? Poor guy is suspicious of everything! It might also be a good idea to let your boy see that the kitten is not a physical threat. Maybe by having them eat some treats together or play string together. It does sound like he might be a bit fearful of her. I'm not sure that I agree that they won't ever accept the new cat. I think there is a chance that they will never be buddies, but they'll almost certainly learn to co-exist fine. It's pretty rare that they'll hate each other forever, though sometimes that does happen. I don't think that's the case here, as if it was your issue would be with excessive fighting right now, and vicious fighting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a great idea to volunteer! Even if you have minimal experience. I've worked for many shelters, but each shelter has their own volunteer system. Usually, you are put through a training prior to your first real volunteer shift anyways, so don't be nervous. If there is no training, mention your concerns to the staff and they will absolutely be more than happy to work with you. You will be able to do whatever you're comfortable with. If you only want to socialize cats, that's normal and totally fine. If you only want to work with small dogs, that's fine too. If you want training to work your way up to bigger and bigger dogs, someone will help you achieve that. At the end of the day, shelters just want their animals to be cared for. While you do the cats or small dogs, someone else will take the rest. I can tell you that shelter work is some of the most rewarding work in the entire world. You are changing lives every single day.  #8203; Goodluck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh absolutely it would help you become prepared for dogs in the future. You will learn so much about handling both friendly dogs and those that need a little bit of extra love. Just make sure that you are always vocal about any questions or concerns you have. It will be tough to see animals that came from difficult situations, and you will see it often. In fact, each case will be difficult and abuse cases are not always the hardest to see. There are animals who are only there because their owners who loved them very much passed away or could no longer care for them, and the animal can't understand why they were abandoned. There are strays who never had a home and don't know what love is. It's all so sad. Every shift you will have a roster of animals that you want to take home with you. However, when you see them go home to a family that loves them and that will care for them, it makes it all worthwhile. It is the most rewarding experience. Moreover, when you work with them and get to be a part of them feeling love again, your heart will be so full. You will be such an important part in making that animal's life better. Each shift you will hear stories about the happy endings, or the progress animal is making, and you are a part of all of it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Noooo no no don't set it free, it won't survive in the wild. If you are willing to go to those lengths, you should try to find someone to adopt the bird. There are bird rescues out there that may take it in and would potentially be willing to pick the bird up. You could also make a post in relevant groups in your area. Though, be very very selective with who you adopt out to and never ever give an animal away for free. There are awful people who will take free animals just to harm them. Setting a price helps to deter these people. Also, if you are going to try and find an adopter, please be careful for your own safety. Since you are young, always make sure a trusted adult knows what is going on and never put yourself in a situation where someone could hurt you. I would try contacting a rescue first. Lastly, rescues aren't going to want to be implicated in stealing the bird so you will have to lie about the situation if you go that route. Another option may be crowdfunding to get the bird a better cage and then doing the rest of the care yourself?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We care for dogs too, and yes the the strays are in constant danger for just existing. However, both species are treated very badly. We have lost so many stray cats and dogs alike this year to the actions of horrible people. It's heartbreaking. On a positive note, there are still a good amount of people who really care and help try to keep them safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone. I volunteer with Crazy Cat Lady Rescues and I recently posted here about the launch of our website. I am reaching out again to say that we urgently need donations. These times with the pandemic are very tough, and we are barely hanging on. We have been out of food for the strays for a very long time. The indoor cats will be out of food shortly, and have already used up their medication. The cats need all of our help, and we can #8217;t do this alone much longer. Please share or donate if you can.

    <TEXT>It really doesn't make sense does it? The dogs usually stay far away from people, but they are still targeted. They aren't bothering anyone. Moreover, they normally are not aggressive because there are people like us that will feed them and care for them. How anyone could even try to justify harming them I'll never know. We are very fortunate to have a vet that treats our stray dogs for us! She is incredible. Please don't worry about not being able to donate, your care for the issue already means the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you thank you thank you so much! I genuinely jumped for joy when I saw that. We appreciate it more than we could ever express. This will get us some much needed medication for the shelter cats. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something that would really make you stand out is any sort of experience along with the degree. You want to prove to the employer why you are better than a non-foreign applicant and worth the extra steps. Try doing volunteer work or internships while you study.</TEXT>
