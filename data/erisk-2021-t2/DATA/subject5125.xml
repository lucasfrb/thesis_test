    <TITLE>MOVESET CHANGES OF TruePower Betty</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-19 07:01:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>My redo of TruePower Betty  #8203; Changes:  #8203; TruePower Betty gains new 2 bars : Magic and HATE  #8203; Magic drains slowly as Betty begins to slowly hyper-heal at 80 percent stamina and more (similar to Undyne's ability to use DETERMINATION to heal herself).  #8203; As Magic reaches Zero, it can't be generated again and Betty relies on HATE. HATE's effects remain mostly similar, though it only lowers her DEF (her ATK is still 65, if it drops to 0, then you're fucked, even if you have like, 250 DEF left from HATE.)  #8203; MOVESET CHANGES: TruePower Betty  #8203; (F - "Shields made of FEAR"): Betty forms her arms into 2 shields made of the same material as Akumu, crouching and putting them infront of her, hiding her body and face, ready to block incoming attacks. Any attacks that are blocked do not do any damage or will have the damage reduced significantly. If too many attacks are blocked, Betty will be stunned, leaving her open for attacks. There are some exceptions to what can and can't be blocked.  #8203; ( Right Click - "Beatdown of a Beast" ): Strong Combo consisting 1 special move (used 3 times) and 2 other moves. Betty latching onto the foe with Akumu formed into a line (similar to Basophobia) and slamming them into the ground 3 times, before dashing towards them and stabbing through the stomach, bashing them 2 times again after with her claws, and then punching them fullforce away, dealing great knockback. The first three attacks respectively deal 86 DMG each, while the 4th attack deals 101, the 5th and 6th attacks dealing both 116 DMG each, and the last punch dealing 159 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (6 - "Ballistophobia V2") (CD 55s): Betty crouches and crosses her arms, as 4 beams of dark-pink magical energy burst from her back, homing towards the target, similar to GTC's DT 4. Each beam deals a respective 56 DMG plus big knockback (like, CG Sword Knockback.) Deals a total of 224 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (7 - "Chirophobia") (CD 20s): Betty clenches her fist, as Akumu gives her more magical energy to her clenched fist, making it grow in size, charging it up with a 0.5 second delay before it punches the person full force, knocking them back. Takes a small bit of mana and deals 254 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (8 - "Sheltoelnophobia") (CD 50s): Betty rushes the victim and punches them in the gut, before immediately crouching and grabbing them with her hand, which is now 25x bigger, similar to Aviatophobia's attack. She begins to crush the foe, draining their HP before she flings them away. Takes a small bit of mana and deals 142 Primary DMG and 56 Drain DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (9 - "Belonephobia: Ultimate") (CD 1m30s): Betty slams both her hands into the floor, vocalizing a slight noise reminiscent of that of a rattlesnake, before multiple spikes surround the victim and, with a 0.5 second delay, stab into them, slamming them down. After they get up, they'll be stunned for around 3 seconds, similar to Cross and XChara's ERASE\_CODE. Takes a mediocre amount of mana and deals 457 DMG. ( DONE OF A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (UNLOCKABLE IF YOU HAVE 2 SOULs OR MORE IN BASE OR HATE MODE)  #8203; (10 - "True Rhabdophobia" )  #8203; Betty will cry out, "Rhabdophobia!" and release a barrier around her. Inside, colors are inverted. Projectiles/mana based attacks that touch the barrier will turn white and freeze, then quickly turn around and fly back to the opponent who launched them. This includes, but is not limited to, Gaster Blasters, knife projectiles, Chara's slashes, and Hate Bomb. Takes up a large amount of mana.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry if I accidentally copied some of your attacks. I tried to fashion them as if they were from the Trello themselves, while also using what Betty did in Animosity. (PS: I just looked at the moves you listed just a second ago, and they are pretty solid. Still thinking of making the Scythe moves for TruePower Betty.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TruePower Betty Scythe Moveset</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-20 14:06:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>SCYTHE MODE  #8203; Moves  #8203;  #8203;  #8203; (Left Click - "True Reaping Slashes"): Scythe combo consisting of 6 slashes. Every even slash adds 24 DMG to the combo, while odd slashes add 34 DMG. The sixth slash deals 46 DMG as well as knockback. Deals a total of 187 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (Right Click - "Reaper-Hell"): Heavy Scythe combo consisting of 7 slashes and 2 special slashes thrown inbetween the 1st and 3rd move. Betty slashes the opponent and makes them crouch as they hold their abdomen as she grabs them again and slams them into the ground and then launches them upwards, Betty jumping up and slashing them quickly before throwing them into the ground again. 1st slash deals 36 DMG, the slam deals 15 DMG, and each even slash made in the air deals 35 DMG, while odd ones deal 39 DMG. The final slam deals 14 DMG. Deals a total of 249 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (F - True Reaper-Blade-Guard) - Betty holds out their scythe in front of them, with the blade facing outwards. Any attacks that are blocked do not do any damage or will have the damage reduced significantly. If too many attacks are blocked, Betty will be stunned, leaving her open for attacks. There are some exceptions to what can and can't be blocked.  #8203; (1 - "True Aichmophobia" ) (CD 35s): Betty teleports to the victim, before posing and slashing the victim vertically, launching them backwards a great distance. Takes a small amount of mana and deals 287 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (2 - "True Reaper Mnemophobia" ) (CD 15s): Betty tilts her head and smiles at a target. If the target is currently making eye contact with Betty, they will be paralyzed while seeing a vision of a pink world and a random person on their friend list standing in the place of Betty. The duration of the paralysis increases the less health the target has.  #8203; (3 - "Runaphobia" ) (CD 55s): Betty dashes runs towards the victim, and if they do not block or dodge out of the way, they get bashed with the top of the scythe and then slashed 7 times, and then punched before being knocked back. First attack deals 29 DMG, while the even slashes deal 22 DMG, and the odd ones deal 27 DMG. The final punch deals 31 DMG. Takes a small amount of mana and deals a total of 229 DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (4 - "Animaphobia" ) (CD 1m30s): Betty appears with an exclamation mark over her head. If the victim doesn't block, Betty pulls the victim close by edging them with her Scythe, before punching them through their chest as she starts to drain the magic/trait from them, giving her HP back. After 3 seconds, she knocks them back. The punch deals 134 DMG while the drain leeches around 34 HP. The knockback deals 26 HP. Takes a large amount of mana and deals 160 Primary DMG and 34 Drain DMG. ( DONE ON A DEF 1 ATTACK DUMMY. )  #8203; (6 - "True Reaper Rhabdophobia" )  #8203; Betty will cry out, "Rhabdophobia!" and release a barrier around her. Inside, colors are inverted. Projectiles/mana based attacks that touch the barrier will turn white and freeze, then quickly turn around and fly back to the opponent who launched them. This includes, but is not limited to, Gaster Blasters, knife projectiles, Chara's slashes, and Hate Bomb. Takes up a large amount of mana.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>About the lighting, I tried to make it more light and added alot of layers to try to make it look good. But after seeing that if I make it too light, it isn't enough, I proceeded to just say "screw it!" and just do that. Note that this was made finished at 2 AM, so I wasn't exactly paying attention xd Either way, thank you! I'll try to improve.</TEXT>
