    <TEXT>Practice empathetic writing. It is highly impossible to memorise to memorise the meaning for 15 poems and a prose for paper 1. So if i were u, i would make sure im really good at the prose so when i get the question i will instantly answer it. Try and write at least 3 pages for each essay (it is generally a good A/ A* essay). For the poem, you have to think quick. Try and divide ur time 45 minutes each. If u find that u cant fo one question, do the other question first and make sure its like top quality. Then the other one just write some points (only if u have trouble with one of it- generally try and give ur best attempt for both). For paper 3, since it is open book, you are required to remember heart to heart the acts and scenes page numbers so as to not waste time reading the text in exam. For paper 3 a good answer will consist of word to word quotes and also empathetic writing ( use the nuances in the play). An A* student would always link the point to what the impact it has on the audience (think of it as an actual play and the audience is watching it. What would the atmophere and mood of the audience be like). This tends to always give a higher edge to the marks even though a person's essay might not always have the right points. Try to fill at least 3 pages or 4 points. 3 good points is generally a B or an A. 4 good points + evaluation is a sure A*. For paper 4, there is not much you can do as it is unseen. However, if you practice your previous paper questions it does give u a boost of confidence while answering. An unseen is perhaps the easier way to score - the examiner doesnt tend to expect contextual knowledge. Word of advice would be to not to only study all the themes, character traits, etc. but to also practice with a time limit. Mostly for literature there is a timing issue.</TEXT>

Try to familiarise urself with situational writing and if u are not the imaginative type, remember a story line that can be applied for any narrative essay.

    <TEXT>Yeah well technically we are supposed to drill a hole to place the thermometer (but this is only taught in A level so u should be all good as long as u have all the points). It is just that in the apparatus they specifically wrote there thermometer which usually hints that it is a compulsory apparatus. Maybe if the marker is slightly more fierce will probs dock a point as they can question the fact of knowing exactly when the ice would melt which would lead to the issue of accuracy of the experiment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ur actually correct but is it a 1 or 2 mark question? If it is 1 mark it should be sufficient but if it 2 then i am not really sure about that. I think as long as u make the connection "as __ increases, this increases __ proportionally" or somethinf like that u should be able to get the full marks. I mean since they only asked why not how. I mean this is what i think.</TEXT>

Paper 43 was just me bullshitting through prose with very weird ideas. Im aware that some ppl have not yet done the papers so im writing this very vaguely. How did u guys find the 2 papers and how did u guys do? How much marks do u think u will get? Honestly, for myself, it can swing only two ways. I can either get 20/25 for both or 13/25. xD</TEXT>

The disadvantage would be that 1) if u are from sch, one examiner generally marks all the papers from the same sch and 2) u might not have the same standard as other candidates who actually studied the actual text.

    <TITLE>the road to taking Classics in uni</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-11 08:23:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>hi i am new here. in my country, singapore, most push away classics and english literature. i have just finished my i/gcse and i am planning on taking english language, english literature, history and classical studies for cambridge A levels. considering that i have never learn latin or greece and i don't live in the uk, will it be impossible for me to get into classics in the uk? i will also be self-studying A levels so i don't really have credentials of having gone to school. i really really want to get into classics overseas ( my country doesn't have it ) but i feel like i am doomed. i am taking a controversial path ( at least that is what they consider in sg ). i don't really know anyone in classics ( because no one takes it in sg ). please give advice on what to do. thank you :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi!! I have just finished my i/gcse and i am predicted to have an A* or an A for all my subjects. I am a private student from sg so i am going to do CIE A levels next year (without As levels). I have no plans to study any science related subjects in the future and i am very interested in either heading overseas to study classics in uni or english literature. I plan to take English Language, English Literature, History and Classical Studies and finish them all in a year? Will unis consider this as 4 distinct A levels? Or will they say it is too similar? Also, is not taking math eliminating alot of my choices? Since i dont study at school, i am not sure if my combination is good or not. Please advice thankuuuu</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For ur three science subjects, keep doing question papers. When i was revising, i found that i didnt know some concepts but since most questions are pretty similar for science, u can kind of "copy of the mark scheme".

    <TEXT>Hey guys, I will be taking Cambridge International A levels in oct/nov of 2020 as a private candidate from singapore. I am cureently waiting for my i/GCSE grades which i predict to have 6 A or A* and 1 B. For A levels im taking English Literature, History, Classical Studies and General Paper. I wish to go for the undergrad for Classics in Oxford in 2021 but im worried. Classics is a highly competitive course and I fear that my i/GCSE grades are not enough. However, since I have to take my A levels in oct/nov (without AS level) , i will be applying with predicted grades. Do i have a decent chance of getting in or should i comoletely drop this dream?

    <TEXT>Take this from a person who just finished her igcse: Wait for oct/nov 2019 math papers to release. The variant 2 paper for math was the hardest (because cambridge changed the question pattern). Also there isnt one series which is harder or whatsoever. Generally oct/nov have a higher gt even though the papers are comparably harder. May/june papers when i practised wete generally easy and march is usually slightly diff questions but even easier. My advice? Practice everything till march of 2016 (dont do 2015, syllabus has changed). Do ALL may/june first, then oct/nov, then march. The march ones tend to be diff but easier. Do all variants for each series, dont skip any. And when oct/nov 2019 math 0580 paper releases, try variant 2. They changed a few questions which many feel that it was the hardest paper because it was unexpected. Hope this helped :))</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-23 12:06:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys im a homeschooler in sg currently doing my cambridge international a levels (exam to be taken in oct/nov 2020). I am aiming for classics at university of cambridge but i am afraid i might not get in because ir is very competitive. My teacher told me that it is not worth getting a classics degree other than at cambridge or oxford but is this true? Because i have been in this community for just a while and i realise that many come from a wide array of colleges. But since i live in sg and i homeschool i dont really know much about this. So could anyone advice wether if classics differ in each university? And if it doesnt, which university/college would be great to do classics undergrad? Side note: for A levels, im doing history, literature and classical studies (and general paper just as a side thing). I have 0 qualification in latin or ancient greek so i would need a college that would provide a 4 year course with the first year to learn latin before resuming with the actual modules from the second year. (and more specifically in the UK) Thank you!!!!!</TEXT>

I even remember thinking that i would rather watch the movie. I didnt quite get the hype either. But i mean u could try and push on and see if u like it at the end. (the dystopian idea is good,, it's just full of plot holes). I would say that the ending is different than many other books. But if u cant read, then dont push.

    <TITLE>EUTHYPHRO- Plato's Socrates</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-02 11:29:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i see that Plato is very biased to Socrates and hence sheds a negative light on Euthyphro . Many papers I have read calls Euthyphro "bad" and "ignorant" but honestly, looking at Socrates own language and questioning method (Elenchus), he's purposely made Euthyphro to admit to certain definitions that Euthyphro himself doesn't belief by tricking him ( Bear in mind . . . that I did not bid you tell me one or two of the many pious actions but that form itself (au to #193; to #193; eidov) that makes all pious actions pious, for you agreed that all impious actions are impious and all pious actions pious through one form (mia #196; #206; ide #194;a #206; ), or don't you remember?) Socrates says a certain definition which he then later tricks Euthyphro by stating that Euthyphro's said that. However, Socrates has contradicted himself too. In Georgias, he says, \[W\]hoever avoids paying his due for his wrongdoing . . . deserves to be miserable beyond all other men . . . and the one who avoids paying what's due is always more miserable than the one who does pay it . . . \[I\]f he or anyone else he cares about acts unjustly, he should voluntarily go to the place where he'll pay his due as soon as possible; he should go to the judge as though he were going to a doctor, anxious that the disease of injustice shouldn't be protracted and cause his soul to fester incurably. . . \[H\]e should not keep his wrongdoing hidden but bring it out into the open, so that he may pay his due and get well . . . He should be his own chief accuser, and the accuser of other members of his family.27 (G. 479e1 #177;480d4). Furthermore, when Polus ridicules the Socratic thesis that it is better to su  #776;er injustice than to commit it and assures him that it would be rejected out of hand by everyone, Socrates replies: \[Y\]ou're trying to refute me in oratorical style, the way people in law- courts do when they think they're refuting some claim. There, too, one side thinks it's refuting the other when it produces many reputable witnesses on behalf of the arguments it presents, while the person who asserts the opposite produces only one witness, or none at all. This \`\`ref-utation'' is worthless, as far as truth is concerned. (G. 471e2 #177;472a1). Doesn't Euthyphro says the exact same thing? He literally advises Socrates not to care about the opinions of the many and Socrates too next advises Crito the same thing? So what puts Euthphro and Socrates apart? Even if we were to state that Euthyphro had claimed to be an expert and he was proved not, are we really sure when Socrates and Euthyphro think themselves experts, are talking about the same branch? Possibly Euthyphro called himself an expert in homeric texts whilst Socrates meant more technically. If we were to talk about Euthyphro unable to put out a definition, for all the talk of defining by Socrates, Socrates doesn't define it. I wish to know what are all of yall thoughts in it and if there is a different argument I could be looking at. Thanku :))</TEXT>

My ultimate aim is to get into Classics in either Cambridge or UCL. However, i realised that to get into Classics in UCL i must have Latin or Ancient Greek (which I don't since in my country they have never offered it) and I am only eligible to go into Ancient World BA.

    <TEXT>for physics and chemistry, read every damn thing in ur textbook and then do as many question papers (in all 3 variants) as possible (follow the marking scheme answers- thy have certain phrases they look for. in igcse they don't really care if u understand ur concepts u need keywords). for math, make sure u don't just remember how to answer a certain type of question but actually understand it- u will notice that for the past few years they have been using the same pattern BUT i did my math 0540 paper 42 exam in oct nov 2019 and they changed the pattern completely, making it the hardest paper ever. (all of us are really praying for low gt because that was the most unexpected paper ever) so understand every damn concept, even the menial ones. use zNotes (especially for science), they are really the best- but try and use this only close to ur exams since it is just a summary rather than detailed points. for First Language English im just gonna tell u to drop whatever ur teacher taught u (yes really), go to youtube and watch every video on MrSallesEnglishTeacher. i swear to god if i am getting an A\*, it is because of his videos. really take this advice on watching his videos, i guarantee u, even if ur english is not that strong, this might help u get an A or even an A\*. For History paper 1, it is clearly remembering every small detail. For paper 2, READ THE EXAMPLE CANDIDATE RESPONSES and mimic the top band style while writing. in igcse level they are looking for structure so just copy the structure there is no point complicating things. for paper 4, ur chosen depth study, literally remember every tiny detail. like srsly. i didn't do geog and econs so i cant advise. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Anyways, if u have any issue in history*** *(20th century option B and depth study Germany)****, english, math, chem or physics, feel free to dm me. i can drop u links and notes for these subjects. this goes out for everyone else too.*** \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- don't procrastinate. don't stress yourself. don't leave everything for the last minute. and don't waste time on pretty notes unless u are the type of person who can only understand by writing out. spend more time on perfecting ur answers for questions. cos that's what igcse honestly looks at anyways. (and to be safe learn every single insignificant fact in ur textbook)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in my experience, they have deducted my marks. there is penalization for exceeding word limits in especially paper 2 - written in one example candidate responses. best if u dont exceed the word limit over 50 words. according to the remarks, few of the sections are testing ur ability to write efficient essays in a word and time limit. i was complacent about this and thought there was no negative marking but in truth, there is. i have never obtained anything below A\* before but i did terribly in igcse because i exceeded the word limit by ALOT for each section. so i advise you NOT to go over the word limit. if you are to go over the word limit, it should be the concluding paragraph, not the main point. despite what everyone says, there is negative marking in a few of the sections (if im not wrong the whole of paper 2 and part a of paper 3 specifically)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CIE: English as First Language 0500 ADVICE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-07 12:22:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys. Many of you have asked me for notes on various subjects and I am sorry I haven't replied (I have had exams for the past month). So instead I am going to make a post for each subject (that I have done) and consolidate all my advice and notes. Follow and I promise you a decent chance to snag the grades you wish to acquire. So WHOOP! let's start with English as First Language 0500. \[1\] Negative marking. There is negative marking. Not on content or grammar but WORD LIMIT. Most of you (especially the alums) are probs going to dig out some of their essays or mark schemes and try to prove that there is no penalization for word limit but I am going to advise you right now not to test on this point in exam. Especially those question that SPECIFICALLY writes there 350-450 words. You are still safe if you go over by 50 words. I beg you not to go any more that that. That is killing your grades. I usually get an A\* in English but IGCSE was the first time I did not obtain that grade. I was shocked- my grammar and vocab is exemplar so what actually happened? So I decided to read up on all the mark schemes and example candidate responses / examiner notes. I was surprised when it was stated that there was penalization for word limits in certain sections. From what I can recall, it very much stated that "after all, it is not just a test of grammar and content, but also ability to write within word and time limit" (can't remember the quote word to word don't diss me on this). So long story short- DO NOT GO OVER THE WORD LIMIT (max 50 words). Especially paper 2. And certainly don't overdo by exceeding 300 words over the limit. It costs your consistency. \[2\] [https://www.youtube.com/user/dominicsalles](https://www.youtube.com/user/dominicsalles) . This is a link (duh) to Mr Salles English lessons on youtube. His channel is a life savior. Please please watch every single on of them. Thank me (or Mr Salles) later. \[3\] If you don't want to watch his videos, let me summarise some important tips I know of the top of my head in this paragraph. (still watch the original videos please). Content  gt; flowery language. Especially in paper 2 and paper 3(a). Why? Well don't ask me. Examiners work in weird ways. Basically don't presume an A\* if you have an extensive vocab. (like me, then I screwed up). 0500 tests on your ability to derive information from the passage. So you could have an average grammar and vocab but still get an A\*. Obviously not below average (that would be unrealistic). So my overall advice after watching his videos is have a clean grammar and pick out enough content to answer the questions. For example, a question that offers 15 marks for content expects you to have 15 points, 5 points for each of the three questions. I don't actually know why they offer it this way (again, absurd examiners, absurd syllabus, absurd expectations) but this is basically a relief for those who aren't that good in English. Again, I emphasise this is an overly simplified overview of Mr Salles youtube videos. Please watch the original ones to understand better. \[4\] How do I study for it? Well, there is no content so of course PRACTICE!! Please write essays. Maybe under timed conditions if you want but to be honest you would have more than enough time in exam to rewrite your essays even (a 2h paper zzz). Practice on evening out your inconsistencies. Now this is where I deviate- one advice for those who aren't that good in English and want to be better (look at part i below) and another for those who want to achieve top grade (look at part ii below). That is not to say those who want to achieve top grade to ignore part i. I'm just assuming you are fluent in your grammar already. And also not limiting those who just want to pass to part i. You can practice part ii too. (i) Grammar practice. Please do this. Tons of it. But I don't mean those grammar textbooks. I mean in your essays. For a start, write one essay in your usual style (maybe in a time constraint situation?). After you are done, REWRITE your essay in a fresh new paper. Go line by line, weed out the grammatical mistakes. This actually helps you to be more self-aware in exam. You are unlikely to become a master in every grammar rule by IGCSE so I suggest you try this method instead. Really no point learning every grammar rule in a few months. Instead, you can try and be more self-aware of your inconsistencies and try to make your essay sound fluent. That is what really matters. This is all you have to do to get the grade you want. Like seriously. Remember what I say about the content marking above? They give you marks like candy for picking out the right points. Now all you have to do is try to sound fluent and like you know your grammar. I don't care what your teacher advises you- this is a tried and tested method that has worked on my friends who couldn't even pass English and then obtained an A just because they practised to sound fluent and were self-aware of their mistakes in their exams. (ii) Timed essays. I know it is a 2 hours paper but give yourself half an hour to write each essay. Just in case in exam you don't like an essay or want to rewrite, well you have alot of time. Now practising in exam conditions is actually useful to see how your writing is. You might have an extensive vocab, but in exam pressure your inner dictionary can seem to cease. Hence, practice day by day, trying to retain as much of your vocab as possible when you write. Easy peasy but alot of work. \[5\] DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ENGLISH. DON'T SLACK. DON'T STUDY ONLY A DAY BEFORE THE EXAM. That's practically begging to screw up in exams. Just don't. I don't care if your command of english is at a university level. Just don't be complacent. \[6\] Ideal practice? One paper (of both paper 2 and 3) a week if your exam is in may in exam conditions. That doesn't include the advice I gave for improving your essay standards in \[4\] (i) or (ii). That is your own initiative. Please don't completely focus on doing papers and neglect your grammar and quality of essays or completely avoid doing practise papers. No ideal number of practise papers but of course the more, the better. Just make sure you don't rush through them but actually write quality essays. I really don't know if I'm missing anything. I again apologise for not answering my DMs. Instead please shoot your questions for THIS SUBJECT ONLY below. Next subject in my list: 0580 Mathematics ps. btw this took a whole hour for me to write pps. sometimes my advice differs from other alums. I just want to say I self-studied IGCSE, hence, my consolidation of the above points are all my observations and resources I have scrounged. I believe that sometimes teachers are not up-to-date with the marking schemes, hence, costing even the best student their A\*. Therefore, it is okay if you have your opinion but I honestly believe the above information are the most accurate. ppps. watch Mr Salles youtube channel. It will really help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CIE: 0580 Mathematics ADVICE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-07 12:48:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>And the saga continues... Previously on my advice series (sounds like the intro of a Netflix show) I wrote for 0500 English as First Language. Just click on my profile and check it out under my "posts" section if you can't find it. Whoop let's start!! \[1\] Practice papers. Lol. You can't escape this. I know most of you have assessment and textbooks from school but honestly, it can only help you so much. Practice papers shows you trends in questions and topics. EVEN if you don't understand anything, by repeatedly doing practice papers, you can work you way up by understanding concepts in the paper itself. For me, I began doing question papers with 50/70 for paper 2 and 80/130 for paper 4. And then begun my fruitful practice of question papers over the next few months, eventually getting me 70/70 for paper 2 and 120/130 for paper 4. It took me 2 hard months but I made it work. So it's simple. Literally do past year papers. \[2\] Now adding or kind of countering the previous point. So I did October/November 2019 paper 42. I just going to say that to be honest, memorising trends and doing question papers can (if you are lucky) get you an A\* easily. TO MY EFFING DISMAY, my variant changed a few of the trends in paper 4. As a result I struggled with a few questions in exam. In the end I got an A (which is kind of wasted potential ). SO NOW I CANNOT EMPHASISE THIS ENOUGH FOR YOU. Clear every doubt on EVERY formula or concept or question you have with your teacher. Please do this. Basically, summarising from the two points, if you are one who just wants to pass math, do part \[1\]. You won't really have time to understand concepts properly by May so it is best if you try and get the trends right. But don't let that limit you to do \[2\] also. Now, if you want your A\*, ensure you got all your concepts crystal clear. Just going to drop it here- the questions I struggled with in exam was question 3, question 4(ii), question 8(b) and question 9(b). These are all questions that I could have answered if understood the concepts better but I couldn't because they weren't the questions I practised in the "trend". Here's the paper if you want to check it out. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mTXI1SPYIwPpCrPal4DO2Fr31puXRNGt/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mTXI1SPYIwPpCrPal4DO2Fr31puXRNGt/view) \[3\] Making notes, well not really effective in math but if it helps you remember a formula better, go ahead. One thing you must memorise is the formulas and the transfiguration vectors. No choice at all. If you are looking for any last-minute notes. Use Znotes.

    <TEXT>revision guides are a huge no-no. revision guides serve as something easy to memorise and you can't memorise for igcse. this is not some kind of school test. most of the skills in 0470 is inferential and ability to analyse. you should be focusing more on answering techniques. for example paper 2. it is literally a source based paper. hence fully skill based. revision guides are honestly useless. considering that ur exam is 3 weeks away, just work on practice papers. use the actual textbook when studying content for paper 1 and 4. i dont know why ur teacher doesnt advise u against using revision guides but please dont use them. study from the cambridge approved textbook and do the past papers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CIE: Chemistry 0620 ADVICE AND NOTES</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-08 11:18:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So previously in this series... I covered 0500 English as First Language and 0580 Mathematics. Now I shall address the most demanded subjected in my DMs. Chemistry 0620 (extended option). I am going to make it plain and clear. This is the EASIEST subject to get an A\*. Heck, I don't even want to pursue science in the future but I got an A\* for this subject. So let's delve in shall we? \[1\] Notes. Write notes. That's the best way to ensure you have covered everything. It is also proven that when you rewrite a certain thing multiple times, you instantly memorise it. Now where should you copy your notes from? I suggest (if you have time), the actual Cambridge book. If you don't have it, here's the link to the pdf: [http://www.gceguide.xyz/files/e-books/igcse/Complete%20Chemistry%20for%20Cambridge%20IGCSE.pdf](http://www.gceguide.xyz/files/e-books/igcse/Complete%20Chemistry%20for%20Cambridge%20IGCSE.pdf) . If your teacher gives you any notes or revision guides, you can write notes out of it too. The only problem with revision guides are that it is over simplified. Hence, sometimes, it misses certain key concepts. You really don't want to be missing these key concepts. So simple; make notes, rewrite things you don't understand again and again. \[2\] This is an alternative for those who do not actually have time to write out notes. Memorise. I honestly don't endorse this move but I mean if it too close the exam, it's best you get those marks instead of trying to be noble and understand concepts. However, some thing just can't be memorised. You can memorise organic chemistry or air and water or all those reactions BUT you can't memorise stoichiometry (mole concepts, etc.) Why? There is no fixed question for stoichiometry in exam. Most of it expects you to understand wether a certain thing is excess, percentage purity, so on and so for. Generally this question is about 10-15 marks in paper 4. That's huge because Chemistry grade thresholds are high (165/200 for A\*), so you don't want to be losing marks. And some things you just have to memorise. Like those iron extraction processes and etc. Really try to retain your marks as much as possible. Oh and yes, DEFINITIONS. Don't underestimate them. Just memorise it. \[3\] Weird and controversial point here. Read the latest two mark schemes and memorise keywords (I hate how IGCSE is mostly a memory game for this subject). So yes, memorise the keywords. Common misconception about 0620 Chemistry is that the examiners are just looking for you to understand the concept. Lol nope. They want keywords. They really don't care about your understanding. Don't believe me? Read the mark schemes. They literally underline all the words you MUST write. Don't test this point in exam. And certain don't expect your examiner to be an anomaly and give you the marks. Just use keywords. I don't know what your teachers say but my friend who wrote no keywords (although she had the best understanding of chem in class) got a D. So there you go. Keywords. \[4\] Practice papers. Please do at least 10 of them before your exam on top of revision and notes. I cannot stress this point enough. You will learn how to craft your answers using keywords by doing more of them. And of course you will learn how sometimes they twist a certain question from a previous paper. \[5\] Use this ONLY 2-3 weeks before your exam. [https://znotes.org/cie-igcse/chemistry-0620](https://znotes.org/cie-igcse/chemistry-0620) . For paper 2 and 4, look under "theory" and for paper 6, look under "practical". They are very brief and summarised notes with all the concepts so it acts best as a "last minute guide". DO NOT USE THIS MONTHS BEFORE YOUR EXAM. Why? When I used it, not ALL concepts were there. So as you go through Znotes, write down missing concepts. THE MOMENT you can identify the missing concepts, it means you have retained your knowledge for this subject. \[6\] Timed assessments. Especially paper 2. It is a 45 minute paper where you have to also SHADE your answers. So you really need to allocate your time properly. Try for less than a minute per question so you have time to recheck and shade your answers. \[7\] DO NOT EVER UNDERESTIMATE PAPER 2 AND PAPER 6. This is a huge problem. Many look at the 80 marks worth in paper 4 and go "lol forget paper 2 and 6". Let me break this to you. There is weighting of x1.25 to get the overall mark of 160 up to 200 (according to them it is to make the marks more "uniform"). Paper 2 and paper 6 have the reputation of being either extremely easy or extremely difficult. At least your paper 2 content is the same as paper 4. But paper 6? That's a whole lot different. Study for all papers. \[8\] How to ensure you know everything tested for exam? PRINT the damn syllabus. Go down EVERY point and ensure you know the DEFINITIONS, KEY CONCEPTS, FORMULAS, THE USUAL QUESTIONS AND THE KEYWORDS FOR THE ANSWERS. You may be covered by your school for content. But paper 6? There is always something the school will miss out. So your syllabus is your bible. Please do this. This is the most important. \[9\] [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC\_kTsxsNVqnymxIJAERYvuQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_kTsxsNVqnymxIJAERYvuQ) Have problems with the question papers? Go to this youtube channel: Science and Stuff. Honestly have to thank them for my A\*. So I have written notes for this but honestly I can't find it (somewhere in my storeroom since I'm nt doing A levels for it). But anyways I dropped a few links above. Use them wisely. Don't be lazy. Study a chapter a day (or part of it if it is long). If you have 3 months to your exam, you can do everything I have mentioned above. You have time. Just don't procastinate. Although the grade boundaries are high for this subject, it is essentially the easiest. I, who have always sucked in chemistry, simply applied the above methods and boom A\*! You can do it too. Drop any question below. NEXT ON MY ADVICE SERIES: Physics 0625 Till then, happy studying!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CIE: Physics 0625 ADVICE AND NOTES</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-08 11:57:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Previously on this advice series (yo I need to find a better intro)... I covered 0500 English as First Language [https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/f09r0j/cie\_english\_as\_first\_language\_0500\_advice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/f09r0j/cie_english_as_first_language_0500_advice/) 0580 Mathematics [https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/f0a0wm/cie\_0580\_mathematics\_advice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/f0a0wm/cie_0580_mathematics_advice/) and 0620 Chemistry (extended) [https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/f0qca6/cie\_chemistry\_0620\_advice\_and\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/f0qca6/cie_chemistry_0620_advice_and_notes/) {sorry if it seems like I am self-promoting, I put alot of effort into this "advice series" and I really wish to see it have a positive impact on at least someone and help them achieve the grade they want} Now time for Physics. By the way, I was very lucky to get an easy paper for Physics hence, achieving an A\* but reality is you might not get an A\* easily. So let's begin. By the way most points are rather similar to the Chemistry 0620 so to make it more uniquely "Physics", I will add in the chapters too. \[1\] First things first, print the syllabus. This subject is actually confusing. Why? Most of our textbooks divides everything into 10-20 chapters. The syllabus? Well they group it into 5 huge themes. The thing about 0625 Physics, that is distinctly unique from other boards is that everything you answer to, links back to that huge theme. For example question 1(a)(i) can ask you on the definition of electricity, question (a)(ii) can ask you a formula to derive joule, question (a)(iii) can ask you to draw a parallel circuit and then (b) can ask you for the NOT Gate and then part (c) can ask you for induction. Essentially you have covered 3 different topics in 1 question. This is the general trend in Paper 4. It is very thematic (mostly, of course not all questions). By knowing your syllabus and making sure you have covered everything in the THEME, you give yourself a better understanding trends in questions and essentially, making your practice for exam better. Making sure you have done everything syllabus (even the smallest things) will go a long way. For example the chapter electricity. The generator is just a small part but it could come out as a 15 mark question. Believe me, it has. \[2\] Never underestimate symbols. Most of teachers probably told you guys that you don't have to remember the symbols for different components but they are actually your lifesaver. Those 1 mark questions tend to be your bliss. \[3\] Never underestimate those NOT, NOR and AND Gates. For me it came out as 12 marks in total. Don't lose it. \[4\] Do as many practice papers as possible. Please. \[5\] Don't just memorise formulas, understand them. There have been many instances in paper 2 especially where they twist the formula or the question. You don't have time to figure out in exam. Best if you figure it out at home. Even if it means figuring out 100 formulas. Probably the biggest tip. \[6\] Paper 6 have ALOT of experiments. You have no choice but to expose yourself to every single one of them. I wouldn't use textbook experiments here (although I don't advise against it). Instead, do at least 10 paper 6 (if you have time, but please really do). Do at least 2 variants for each year. \[7\] [https://znotes.org/cie-igcse/physics-0625](https://znotes.org/cie-igcse/physics-0625) . I used this but there are a few concepts missing. Add them into these notes. Print it and write the missing formulas. Physics is just alot of understanding of formulas (for igcse, not generally) so I honestly prefer revision guides in Physics. \[8\] Read worked examples. They are the TRUE LIFESAVERS. For me, I didn't understand turning effect, even just before exam, but I read up all the worked examples so I could understand how to approach the question. \[9\] Ah yes. Significant figures. We always use 3 significant figures in math. That is not the case in Physics. Most of the time it is 2 or 1 significant figures. It depends on the question. Always count the significant figures of all values given in the question. MOST OF THE TIME IT IS 2 SIGNIFICANT FIGURES. It is the safest to use to 2 significant figures. (My teachers said otherwise but I checked the mark scheme and 3 sf is said to be "too many sf"). DO NOT write exact values in your answers for Physics. This isn't Mathematics. \[10\] Have any doubt with past year papers. Go to the youtube channel "Science and Stuff". Here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC\_kTsxsNVqnymxIJAERYvuQ/featured](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_kTsxsNVqnymxIJAERYvuQ/featured) Not sure what I missed here but there you go, do all these in Physics and you are all set. Don't procrastinate or underestimate Physics. You need alot of time for this. Any question drop it below. NEXT ON MY ADVICE SERIES: History 0470</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey!!! I am Roopali (prefer to be called Pali though). I'm 16 and I doing CIE A levels this year in Classical studies, Literature and History. I'm a homeschooler Singapore (so I'm lonely) and I really hope I get into Oxford or Durham in the UK to study classics as a major next year. Honestly if there is a degree that gives me all three literature, history and classics I will take it though. I have way too many favourite books- I am kind of in the age where I'm shifting from YA Fantasy Fiction into Classics like Homer, Plato and Shakespeare. I watched Dead Poets Society just a two weeks ago and it was amazing so I was looking through textposts and I found this term "Dark Academia". Once I searched up the definition, I instantly fell in love with it and here I am, 2 weeks into Dark Academia and already absolutely crazy for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im doing A levels this year and I took Classics and honestly it is better than Ancient History in my opinion. Classics kind of open more into literature, history, philosophy AND history of art. Ancient history is, well, literally the history. For me Classics is is more fun. It also opens your eyes to a multitude of things, so you kind of have a taster in each part of the Classics rather than just subjecting yourself to history of it. It really depends and I will be happy to answer any further questions :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yo hold on i will make a post on it soon but right now you can follow this: Practice empathetic writing. It is highly impossible to memorise the meaning for 15 poems and a prose for paper 1. So if i were u, i would make sure im really good at the prose so when i get the question i will instantly answer it. Try and write at least 3 pages for each essay (it is generally a good A/ A\* essay). For the poem, you have to think quick. Try and divide ur time 45 minutes each. If u find that u cant fo one question, do the other question first and make sure its like top quality. Then the other one just write some points (only if u have trouble with one of it- generally try and give ur best attempt for both). For paper 3, since it is open book, you are required to remember heart to heart the acts and scenes page numbers so as to not waste time reading the text in exam. For paper 3 a good answer will consist of word to word quotes and also empathetic writing ( use the nuances in the play). An A\* student would always link the point to what the impact it has on the audience (think of it as an actual play and the audience is watching it. What would the atmosphere and mood of the audience be like). This tends to always give a higher edge to the marks even though a person's essay might not always have the right points. Try to fill at least 3 pages or 4 points. 3 good points is generally a B or an A. 4 good points + evaluation is a sure A\*. For paper 4, there is not much you can do as it is unseen. However, if you practice your previous paper questions it does give u a boost of confidence while answering. An unseen is perhaps the easier way to score - the examiner doesnt tend to expect contextual knowledge. Word of advice would be to not to only study all the themes, character traits, etc. but to also practice with a time limit. Mostly for literature there is a timing issue.  #8203; I gave this advice to someone last year and the person told me he/she got an A when the person was predicted Bs and Cs the whole year. So it is proven to have worked before :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is hard to jump in to those big books immediately. It takes quite some to get there. I'd suggest you to try sci-fi? Seems you like astro and ethics but if you read non-fiction immediately you won't get into the mood for reading. You could try Jay Kristoff- he writes science fiction. Try the Iluminae Files. It is a well-respected read and it helps integrate you into the habit of reading because it is really interesting. Always start with a good genre of fiction that gets you into the habit of reading then reading non-fiction becomes easier.</TEXT>

I did CIE IGCSE (go to cambridgeinternational website). IGCSE is the equivalent of O levels. And yes, this is recognised in singapore. It is just as good as the singapore O levels. You can get into uni or work just fine. Basically if you want to do IGCSE you have two choices- go to an international sch or homeschool (and take your exams in British Council). Any other questions, just feel free to dm me. I did my IGCSE last year. By the way, if you want to homeschool, it would be preferable if you do Cambridge IGCSE because British Council no longer does Edexcel. feel free to ask me anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>dont worry, im in the same boat as you. if i start on a book and even if im a few pages off the end, i have to reread again. the key is to break it slowly. break into numbers you like. so i like all things four and if i exceed it, sixteen, so i would count doing 4 or 16 pages each time im reading and it feels way better for me. it took some time but i managed to break my ocpd to slightly less tiring (i guess this is the word). so i would advice u to count ur pages as u go and stop at one of the multiples of that numberv(if u want to do 7, then count to 7 and everytime u reach 7, u restart from 1, it worked for me). its still very compulsive but way better than reading 250 pages immediately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yooo i got the same offers (but im choosing to do a gap year and get in next year). im international also. according to whatever i researched, edinburgh is better if u want to get back to the states (since is has a great reputation worldwide) whereas if u want to stay in the uk, durham has the better reputation. i like durham better too (the atmosphere is more my style and so is the optional modules given). durham also has better research for classics compared to edinburgh. edinburgh is very expensive to live in (so if ur not going to stay there no use wasting 4 years when u can do 3). UCL on the other hand has a very different atmosphere. it is very city-like (so if u want like a more gothic or college-y kind of experience, durham will suit u better). anyways, ucl classics is one of the best (after undergrad if im not wrong). ucl, however, has reputation internationally and back in the states. ucl is top 10 internationally, but not in the UK apparently. if i were u, i would put durham first, then ucl, then edinburgh. but that's mainly because i wish to stay in uk to finish postgrad aft my undergrad so the atmosphere and cost for me would be really impt +i would have to look at the ranking of the uni in UK itself not just internationally. since u want to get back the states asap, ucl would be better followed by durham then edinburgh. anyways good luck and hope u get that UCL bread!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>grade thresholds are released on the day of results only. btw, you should know 90% will always be an A\*, 80 \* will be an A so on and so for. Pass will be a C 50 - 59%. You will never know your actual marks btw, only the percentage uniform marks. Anyways a 90% in History will mean 100/150 whilst in Chemistry it could mean 185/200. So don't mix that up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah sure. so cambridge is unable to give our raw marks- for confidential reasons. so instead they make this "percentage uniform mark". this is to eliminate any inconsistencies in markings since the papers are marked by different examiners. it would be unfair if two people has similar quality answer but examiner A gives person X 19/25 whilst examiner B gives person B 15/25. Hence, the percentage uniform marks is a spectrum. For example if an A\* in the grade thresholds is 180/200, a 90% means your raw marks was closer to 180/200 whilst 97% would mean your A% is closer to the highest achieving marks (not 200. highest achieving raw marks could be 190/200). So it doesn't mean that if you get 100% means you automatically got full marks. Instead you got the highest raw marks. So if you think about it, percentage uniform marks is basically like a percentile. Hence, 90% will ALWAYS be an A\* regardless of whether for that year an A\* is 150/200 or 170/200. This standardizing makes it more fair.</TEXT>

My love for classics, literature and history is what matters in this community honestly. I don't care if I am not pale or skinny. I let my black hair natural (btw it is what is loved in this community, natural black hair) and allow myself to immerse in the aesthetic w/o thinking too much about how predominantly it is eurocentric. Don't let it deiscourage you from loving DA. Anyways, this aesthetic loves natural hair and curls (apparently). Don't alter your hair. Instead play around with different coats until you find one that suits your hair. I can absolutely picture you rocking a green trenchcoat.</TEXT>

I am doing: Paper 1: International Peace and Security 1919-1939 (international option) Paper 2: International Relations (1919-1933 and 1933-1939) Paper 3: The Cold War (International option) Paper 4: Europe of the Dictators (European option) Are these options okay? Or must I change Paper 3 to The Holocaust (European Option)? Someone please clarify my doubts thanks!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CIE: Looks like so many people are confused with percentages and grade thresholds so here is some explanation on what they are</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-26 05:17:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>The marks you get back on your results statement is this thing called PERCENTAGE UNIFORM MARK which is essentially acts like a percentile but Cambridge of course complicates things. So basically, you will NEVER know your RAW MARKS or ACTUAL PERCENTAGE for any of your subjects (unless you by back your papers but CIE doesn't allow it anymore). So 90%-100% will ALWAYS be an A\*. 50%-59% will always be a C. So on and so for. GRADE THRESHOLDS tell you the lowest mark for your grade. So let's say the gt says that for an A\* you need at least 181/200. If you get 90% means you got closer to 181. If you get 100%, that doesn't mean you got 200, it simply means you got the highest achieving mark for A\*. A 100% could be 194/200 or 198/200. I have seen some people before get upset over their statement of results, crying over the fact that it wrote they 72% (which is a low B) and assuming that it is their raw marks. But it is not. The first digit of the percentage uniform marks tells you which grade it is. The second digit tells you whether you are in the upper or lower band of that grade. (this is written exactly in CIE results guidelines). So when you say that 76% is an A\*, you are actually wrong since you will never know your marks. The only thing you do know is grade thresholds. Please stop messing this up. It might not be that huge a difference for subjects like math but it is a huge matter in history since the grade thresholds for an A\* is like 100/150 and so many of you are leading people to believe that a 90% is 135/150. It isn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a difficulty with writing the book itself (I have a whole 5-book series planned). How is your writing process? Do you write a draft first which is "imperfect" (sentences not exactly formed well) and then rewrite it after you finished writing the whole book or do you have the tendency to write perfectly the first time? As a person with OCPD, I find it difficult to accept mistakes and when I can't form proper sentences, I just delete the draft. Your advice would be very well appreciated :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>heyy!! For CIE, there is no minimum number of subjects you must sit for. It is however advised to keep a minimum of 5 subjects for entry into university. if you find it too difficult to manage 7 subjects, you can either do 5 subjects in May and then the other 2 in October or latest by the next may (this will be counted as 7 subjects. you must sit all your exams no more than 12 months in between the two series),, or if you are just looking to pass, drop extended and take core. It will of course affect your credibility to those "top" universities, but as long as you have decent grades for the other five, your options are opened to average universities and if you do well in A levels after, may be able to climb to those top unis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my interpretations might be abit of a stretch but here it is: I would call it the "Threads of the Universe". For obvious reasons we can see spools of red thread. The red symbolises physical action, lust, love, anger, violence. It is basically like a spectrum. There is no clear definitive answer to what red means- it can range from the angel to the devil. Hence, the colour signifies the vastness- humans often try to minimise the meaning of things by defining it. But red? If you ask a Chinese the person will say the colour is auspicious. If you ask a person who has PTSD from war, red is a representation of bloodlust and war. The possibilities are endless. Hence, the colour red, although looks definitive on paper, if we consider what the person might think after seeing red, you will notice there is no fixed answer. We can see a spool of yellow thread coming from a box. Okay let's address the box first. It has green, yellow and red circles painted on it. This is closely associated with traffic lights- green means go, yellow means pause, red means stop. Hence, by painting all three colours on the box instead of just one colour, it encourages this idea of "vastness"- how life is not just a play button or a stop button. It has all aspects of it together. Again, it is due to human's mentality, that when you see a stop sign means all must stop, we limit ourselves. Think of it my traffic sign shows red but 500 yards away a traffic sign could be green. But since the red traffic light affects me directly, I only care about it. Thus, by painting all three colours, it shows how limited our minds are and encourages us to open our minds and see the world through different perspectives. That yellow thread: yellow symbolises hope and happiness but also cowardice and deceit. Again, this is like the colour red and open for interpretation depending on the person's perspective. If I take into perspective that it means hope, then it shows the human's mind in a more positive light. If i take into perspective it means deceit, then it shows human's mind to be narrow-mind and hence it decieves us, thinking that we have got it all right although we haven't fully explore it. We see that it goes over a box that has its side flaps open but ultimately still closed. The fact that it is not sealed shut shows that it is not too late to open our minds about things. It is just a matter of opening the other two flaps. The two open side flaps symbolises that our minds always search for an answer but it always goes "sideways" and never looks "forward" or "backward" to find an answer properly. In essence, we assume that we have opened the box by opening the two flaps but we need to open all flaps to open the box. The threads are connected to what I presume is an eye. (This is where I am most doubtful, what is it??). I presume it is an eye due to its figure and it also to me mimics a few of those ghastly horror movies' eyes. Notice that the thread goes straight into the eyes. I imagine it symbolises this connection of what we see vs what we percieve. We see the colour yellow but we percieve it to be "sunny". Hence, again it ties it all in, the fact that it is the human's minds that alter what we see to a perception that we all learn. Notice that at the eye(?), there is white lines over it that looks like a helix. This has an effect of drawing the viewer's eyes immediately. Think; we are always drawn to what is more obvious and attractive, but we always forget to see the "full picture". The white ring surrounding the eyes and box seems like a "halo", which possibly has the intention of bring our attention to it immediately. The background of it- it looks like the milky way galaxy, hence we can presume it to represent the universe. Now trying to tie in the whole thing- there are a multitude of these "threads" we see, but in the end, we choose only to see what is more direct to us, and we forget to see the "bigger picture", in essence the universe as a whole rather than just ourselves. The universe too has a thread-like texture, affirming that we pull apart the universe, thread by thread to find the thread we percieve, instead of just viewing all the threads of the universe together. The rest of the background is white. White is generally a spectrum of colours put together and that is something neither our eyes can see or minds percieve for it is beyond our understanding. I am not sure if I am even close to what you intended but this is what I think of the artwork.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ahahahaha same with my parents (yo asian problems). Not gonna lie but u r really going to suffer lmao. History and literature are the two of the most heaviest content and essay subjects, art requires all your remaining free time and law is a good subject but it is useless for uni. At first i too wanted to do like 4 to 5 subjects but instead i chose to do lit, history, classical studies and general paper. I mean in doing fast track a levels so to me these subjects are already very time consuming but i love them anyways. Anyways, 4 subjects is enough. Unis in the uk ask for 3, unis in aus and singapore prefer 4. Btw just so u know all unis only look at ur best 3 including oxford. No one cares if u have the 4th. Ur subject combination is a strong one and very well respected (although no uni ask for law a levels at all) but 4 subj is good. Dont take 5. Like srsly dont haha. Even if ur doing 2 years. Rmb u have extra curriculars and in year13, university essays to fill ur time. But this is good tho.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make two different sets of flashcard. One will be more events oriented. That is essentially your timeline (but kind of broken into different cue card instead of congested into one). So on each card, put only ONE event. It makes it easier tbh. The other set of flashcards, make it solely through question papers. Working through question papers for paper 2 is a good way to familiarize yourself with the topic. So one question per flashcards and just briefly write out the points. This really worked for me (I too couldn't memorise paper 2 content that well for some time). Really hope this helped :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys I'm a homeschooler from Asia and I'm currently doing CIE A levels for Classical Studies, History, Literature and General Paper but I want to do Latin HL from IB. (I don't want to do the full IBDP/CP). There isn't an A levels for Latin in my country (only for IB). Is there a way I can do only one subject for IB? (and a private candidate too?). Any advice would be very much welcomed since I have been searching this question up for months now and I still haven't gotten an answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ohhh that's really interesting. For us it was more about developing skills in analysing for English (such as comprehension) and among other things, listening comprehension, essay writing- narrative, expository etc and bunch of other components. But there was no "reading" or "literature" component ever in English. Essentially English for us is only compulsory to take up till 16 years old and Literature up till 14 years old (after that we can choose) and since only 2-3% of the cohort take English after 16 and 10% take Literature after 14, English up till 16 for us is more about developing skills that are interchangeable with other subjects (for eg general paper, economics etc). Even in Literature we are not assigned any extra books to read other than the ones tested in exam. In a way, it puts most Singaporeans in a disadvantage by the time they do A levels/AP/IB because we learn more essay and analytical skills but we are not exposed to much literary works. wow really interesting how different our curriculums are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if u can, get in to durham first. after year 1 there is many student run fundings or if you do really well, try to get a scholarship for year 2. maybe you can work part-time in year 1 also. don't let the fees get in between u and ur academics (btw all the unis u have to pay similar fees and durham is one of the unis with lower fees so if u cant get into durham, there isn't much uni options left). try to figure something out, don't reject the offer. if u find that accommodation is the problem, talk to the uni and ask if u could work something out such as living certain months at home (if u live in Durham). from what i heard, most get a rented apartment in year 2 onwards (i have to fact-check this again) so don't lose hope!! if u do really well in year 1 then u will be offered a multitude of scholarships and funding. just don't throw away this offer, durham is prestigious and maybe u can't afford now but aft bachelors, the reputation of durham uni will follow behind u in ur job applications. if you really can't (don't think u can work part-time or don't want to put hope into this tiny chance of scholarships and funding in year 2), then its okay, dont regret or beat urself up and instead look towards other uni offers and work towards that. hope this helped :)) don't despair!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey!!!! so i did o levels (or at least studied for it) in sg up till sec 3, then changed to (i)gcse in sec 4 (homeschooled) and now im doing UK A levels too!! Im doing CIE Classical studies, Literature, History, General paper (just in case i want to study in sg for uni). I enjoy literature very much at A levels. It is so much better (and thrice-four times the workload) compares sg O levels/ GCSE. If you are aiming to do Computer Science, you only need two- three "science subjects". Maths and Physics would be invaluable. Further maths is useful if you want to get into mathematics. Chemistry is useful if you want to get into natural sciences, biochem, etc. You don't actually have to do four "sciences" (math is considered a science btw) to get into comp sci. u only need it for competitive medicine courses. If you are planning to take CIE literature (9695), I highly advice you to take it. It will give you some respite in Sixth Form. Unless the Sixth Form you are applying to provides only OCR or AQA, well it will be slightly harder but still worth it. Ultimately, choose your A level subjects this way- the minimum needed for uni and then + what you think you would enjoy. Again, i will emphasise, comp sci needs generally 2-3 "science" subjects. any more than that will be useful in your personal statement and to show interest but not necessary. if you really want to do lit, do it, you won't get a chance to study it in uni. anyways, as a person who have studied both the singapore-cambridge o level, (i)gcse and currently doing UK A levels, the literature in singapore-cambridge o level is actually nothing compared to both gcse and a levels in the UK. (yep local students in sg got it really easy). in sg o levels we only have to study one play, one prose and unseen over two years. when i switched to (i)gcse, i was shocked to see in addition to a play and a prose, there were 15 poems and coursework. Similary, UK A levels will have around 8-9 set texts(which is btw 3 more set texts than singapore-cambridge A levels!!!) and coursework. So basically I have to do 20 poems on Robert Frost, three Shakespeare plays, 3 prose, and two epics (im not doing coursework). Just know that literature will be time-confusing, four times more the workload, and the essays we learn in school are utterly useless. But if you enjoy it, then you won't find it to be too difficult. Anyways, if you have any doubts, DM me!!! As a person who transferred from sg local system to Uk GCSE and Sixth Form, I too was really confused with my choices but ultimately I figured it out!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly feel bad for you since everyone in the comments is dissing you. So allow me to be the better person and analyse your analysis in a more civilised way lmao. I get your point. The females are portrayed as very "feminine" and the males as very "dominating". I do find that it is an issue but again, it is ultimately a work of fiction. I think what Sarah J Maas is playing at is the folklores. Fay/fae/Fey are all part of folklores, all existing at a time where females felt better of themselves as "beautiful" with "curves" and males to be the more "aggressive". You can see in the Irish and Scottish Gaelic folkores. Ultimately, there is a hugeeee resemblance of her characters to many folklores and myths (Feyre to sleeping beauty, Tamlin to Tam Lin, etc.) And in these myths, gender disparity is common. So we can say that Sarah j maas works is not reflective of our society, but rather its myths and folklores, 1000 years ago. Context is different and hence, so is her fictional characters. About this whole "white" thing, remember we are talking about Fay here. Notice how Aelin is painted on books, paper-white. I don't think I've seen a person that pale white before. She is Fae. And Feys in most folklores are described as pristine white, inhumane white, etc. It is only when we contextualise our world, it would seem as a bias to the whites. Again, we are dealing with folklores. So why not change these folklores? Well, because Sarah J Maas has explicitly said that she based her story and characters on folklores and myths and if she had introduced a diversity, critiques and academics in folklores are going to be criticising her work for trying to contextualise it into today's society rather than staying through the fey myths. Of course, as a reader today, it would seem to be a "bad example" but again, this is a work of fiction set in another world. Now if Sarah J Maas had said the plot was in this wrld we are living in, then ur point would be extremely valid. Except, it cleverly isn't. Ultimately, by setting it in another unknown world, in an unknown time with 1000 year old folklores, Sarah J Maas, it is technically our fault for placing these perceptions into the book. In essence, I enjoy the books very much (although I do have my own issue with the whole Tamlin-Feyre-Rhysand thing but that's for some other time). I understand your criticisms and they are valid as they are your perceptions and we should always ask ourselves what could have been done better and what is unrealistic. It's sad that you have lost much of your love for SJM books. I understand its something that is highly sexist but again, as i assert this, it is ultimately based on folklores 1000 years ago. And SJM has tried to stay true to it. Maybe, just maybe if you ever want to try rereading the books, try and reread it as a folklore written by a person 1000 years ago. Considering that it is very much like Greek mythology/Dramas, it might help you read it better and you might be able to forgive the sexist intentions. Ultimately, try and read it as a work of fiction. I do know that lots of people in real life are influenced by this so much so to put into effect of it in real life but again, it is the perception of people. There will always be this issues and it is tbh abit useless to mark down a book since it is a fiction not a non-fiction or personal recount. If it was a non-fiction or a fiction set in a real-life context, your points are very much valid and should be a concern but in my opinion, although books by SJM are a huge thing in the YA, one should know that in the end fiction is not reflective of life. Also btw, SJM wrote this series when she was 16 and after that started editing it. Hence, her books, just like the Harry Potter series, is written in a context where females and POCs didn't have much of a voice as now. Sorry I repeated my points again and again and I'm sorry so many people in the comments attacked you without looking at both sides of the argument. Have a great day :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So basically Athena is the goddess of warfare and wisdom. But in her Roman form she was "demoted" to goddess of wisdom and crafts. Ares is the Greek god of war whilst Mars is the Roman god of war, warfare and strategy. That's why you see a similarity. The Romans made the female goddesses more "chaste" and "weaker" whilst making the male gods more "organised". Hence Mars is not just the god of war but also warfare. Thus the similarities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey!!! That's weird that British Council in your country doesn't offer practicals for CIE. I am doing CIE rn for A levels this nov at British Council (private candidate). In fact, British Council is required to do CIE. In fact, in my country Edexcel is being cancelled in British Council. It's abit amusing tho xD. Im from Singapore btw. They are both equal quality. CIE has a good reputation for its subjects. It is organised in results and resources. It's syllabus is straightforward. It, and this may vary in different countries, but its more well-known. So in sg over here, most people are confused when I say Pearson Edexcel A levels. But Cambridge International? Well they know that. Still they are both A levels, both boards are internationally recognised. I wouldn't stress over it. If you really want to do CIE, then go for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>true, you can see how they depict their own goddess bellonna in a way better light than the "greek-adapted" goddesses. well with the exception of venus since she is prominent in the aeneid. the romans also, i assume, linked chastity to "weakness". the romans believed that women were to supposed to be wives and mothers. the fact that minerva and vesta are chaste and they are given limited roles, reflects the roman nature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As for me, I am learning Latin now and when I go to university I will learn French and Ancient Greek. I chose to do Latin first since many languages originate from this one. Also, I find it easier to pronounce. For French, you might need a tutor or some friends who speak French to become fluent in it, not just able to read and write it. For Latin, the grammar rules might be tricky but since most English words are derived from it, I find that the vocab is easier and also easier to speak/ pronounce the words. Since learning a language would mean read, write and speak, Latin would be better (especially for self-study).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure they can read their minds but they won't be able to understand it. For example, if a person doesn't know French and he reads the mind of a guy that is in French, he wouldn't understand it. Similarly, a legilimens can probably hear the dog but can't decipher what it's saying. I just realised that you have already speculated this ahahahah I only read the title and immediately answered. Anyway your hypothesis is right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on your interests. So let's say your diploma is not relevant to the course you want to go into uni, taking A levels would be worth it. Anyways, other than that, if you really want to take A levels, you can just do it in one year (Fast Track or just homeschool). Alot of people are probs going to reply is not worth it and waste of time but as someone who has done a diploma in a private sch and currently doing A levels in a year (but im still 16-going-17 though), it is worth it. Since A levels hold more value than a diploma, it is definitely worth it as long as ur willing to spend another year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hmm.. i see... so i just searched up the meaning of legilimency to get the exact definition and this is what came up: ***Legilimency*** *is the act of* [*magically*](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Magic) *navigating through the many layers of a person's mind and correctly interpreting one's findings. A person who practises this art is known as a* ***Legilimens****.* I think we can agree that Harry and Voldemort is a unique case? So bringing them in as an evidence might not be the best example but seeing from the definition you are right about the fact that it's not mind reading. I think essentially, if we consider Snape and Harry's legilimens lessons, you can see that theirs is more of "see the images of the past or memories or the person's thoughts but crafted in images". But thanks anyways for pointing out it wasn't mind reading so I could revise my point!! So I guess, @ OP, you can't read most animals' minds if you are a legilimens because most animals do not process images and memories the same way as humans but we might be able to do for certain exemptions that are similar to humans such as dogs and possibly monkeys. If I'm wrong, someone please point it out thank you!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you **want** to fall in love with reading and gain knowledge, you are already halfway there. The other half would be to actually pick up a book ahahhaha. If you don't feel like reading that day, just go through some small quotes or poems. If you feel like reading then even better, start on your book. Whenever you feel like writing anything down at all just do it. The other half, I believe is not innate but more "impulse" and you can form "impulse" by yourself by looking through study accounts or dark academia aesthetics. Theyw ill make you feel like engaging in something and whatever calls out for you at the moment, do it. You don't have to force yourself or make a habit. You just need abit of motivation to push you into this. Have a great day!!! :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Raw marks are the initial marks. Basically it is without any weighting at all. Generally the first marks an examiner gives you. After that it goes through a process called "weighting". Usually for science its x1.25. For some subjects, some papers have more weightage so they will multiply according to that. This is where you will get the final mark and this is the marks yo won't get. For convenience sake, let's call it standard marks. These standard marks are then compared to the grade thresholds (gt). If the gt for that year for an A\* is 181 and your **standard marks** not raw marks is 181, you get an A\*. Some schools get back their raw marks because they can buy back their papers and I have heard of cases where the student gets upset that they totaled up their raw marks and got 184 but didn't get an A\*. This is because the CIE don't care about your raw marks anymore and raw marks doesn't affect your grade after weighting. The result you see on you results is called a **percentage uniform mark.** This is a tricky concept btw. If it shows 95 on your results, that doesn't mean you got 95/100 marks. Nor does it mean (let's say A\* is 180/200) that you got exactly 190/200. No. What it means you got midway of 180 and the highest scoring mark. The highest scoring mark could 195 or 187. So basically the first digit of your percentage uniform mark tells you your grade. The second digit tells you how high or low your grade it. This is quoted exactly from the CIE guidelines so if anyone wants to criticise it because your teacher said something else, lmao. Percentage uniform mark is NOT PERCENTILE. For example (for percentile) , if there are 100 people doing a subject, 10 people will get an A\* and 1 person will get each mark. It is very uniform and there is equal distribution of people and grades. 1 person will get *96* and 1 person will get *95.* BUT for percentage uniform mark, any number of people can get A\*. So if there are 100 people doing a subject, 30 people can get A\*. 15 people can get *96* and 2 people can achieve *95.* So please don't mix them up. Someone is going to come up and say that "we DO get our marks back". Yeah you do, raw marks if your school does buy back your papers. But just remember that is not your actual marks. If you check out the website then you will know that your raw marks is just stage 1. There are 5 steps and your final marks are bound to change. Someone is also going to say percentile and percentage uniform mark is the same thing. If your teacher said it, and you haven't actually read it in the CIE website, please do that first before giving out wrong info. All in all, I wouldn't stress over this too much. Notice how much process your marks goes through. Instead of you know worrying too much on this, focus more on trying to get as close to full marks for each subject. That is the only way you can be sure about that A\*. Remember grade thresholds change every series so no use trying to gain only a certain amount of marks. All the best for iGCSEs and hope you do well :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wood? I would make a more common object BUT put a twist to it. So let's say a phone holder. That's basically the first thing we do in DT. But try and make it more complicated. Can you make it foldable? Stackable? Can you add multiple devices? Can you make a fastener to make sure that the device doesn't fall off? Common misconception for DT is that you need an object that not many people do. That's not true. The people with the best marks always takes a simple object and make it more innovative. Hope this helps!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it is mainly because James and Sirius have more chemistry. They are literal best buddies, making fun of others together, partnering up with each other, whereas Remus is less "involved" in their schemes, hence not having this "unique" link with his friends. Sure they are an excellent friend group but James just seemed to connect more with a guy who helped frequent jokes and pranks. An example would be the part where Remus pretends to read and tries not to get involved in bullying Snape. Thus, we can see that Remus, yes, is part of the friend group but due to his little involvement in pranks, it made him slightly detached from James compared to Sirius, who does everything James does. Remus and Sirius are more similar, so they relate to each other better. They are both arrogant about their academics, sports and good looks, making them relate with each other better. This is comparable in real life. Even if you have a closely knit friend group, there will always be this one person you would feel more attached to. I feel bad for Remus though. He seems to be no one's best friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True :(( Maybe Remus is a reflection of a real-life person. The one who is really kind and nice and doesn't engage in all this "fun" usually gets left out alot although they are generally very well-liked. It is unfair but I think many would have resonated with Remus. He is painted to be a sad character and he really deserved more but if he really is a reflection of a real-life character, then the sorrow, the regret, being no one's best friend is realistic. But since this is a fictional book, I wished JK Rowling at least gave him a happy ending or some good friend or heck, even the role of godfather or sth to Remus. Even Pettigrew was nominated by Remus to be the keeper of their house address the day Lily and James dies. Maybe JK Rowling was solely focused on the plot advancement that she just threw up this pitiful character who is left under-appreciated and to live an unfair life. zzz JK Rowling has done this in some of her recent works and it's just sad :((</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Dark Academia, well most of us here flirt with idea of death, alcoholism, existentialism, etc. (although it is highly unrealistic but well, we are talking aesthetic not reality here). In Dark Academia you can typically see more "brooding" and dark posts pondering about life and romance. Also, the aesthetic generally follows Gothic buildings, medieval and renaissance paintings, books naturally, classics- all in this almost yellowish, decaying and dark-ish state, making it very mysterious but not downright horror. For example, [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/6xWURGGhE6oeRZ2z5) Light Academia on the other hand is generally very "positive" and more about "self-care". You know, the light cheery stuff. I don't engage in much Light Academia but it is the literal opposite of DA. Cottagecore is very self-explanatory. It is an aesthetic inspired by a romanticised interpretation of western farm life. It focuses on the idea of a simpler lifestyle in harmony with nature. Some associated themes include environmental sustainability, nutrition and self-care. All three aesthetics is amazing and you can engage in whichever you want!!! There is also no limits. So what if you like DA? You can also enjoy cottagecore too!! (quite a few people i know do both)!! Good day to you!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: Currently u/arimeii7 posted another post with a new link to this same group u can use that link if u want get in!! Heyy guys!!! It is currently now a difficult time for us all (covid pandemic) and I was wondering if anyone wanted to make a group chat on discord and motivate each other to study. How it would work is that at the beginning of the day you can write down on a list what you are supposed to do for the day and by the end of the day, tick off the checklist of whatever you have done. You can post this on the discord chat so that others can motivate and remind you to finish your checklist. You can also post whatever you are studying (so like a studyblr but real-time). Discussions on any subject (reading novels, STEM, classics, literature, history, law, philosophy etc) is allowed. Anyone of any age and study level is allowed to join, as long as you are motivated to study and will make the group conducive. Fun-facts and quotes and other dark academia related stuff (like blogs or aesthetic posts) are allowed. Btw, I am 16-going-17 year old female doing Fast Track A levels in Classical Studies, Literature and History and I understand not everyone does the same thing so it's completely okay if you are a 30 year old doing a pHD or doing AP High School in the US, etc. How many of you would be interested in this group chat on discord? If you are interested, please comment below your study level (like high school or undergrad, etc) and your subject(s). This is just so as to know if I should branch out in the discord group itself other sub-groups for that particular subject. ahahah I feel like no one's really going to care about this idea but if you do want to join, just comment below. Once I know there is a good number of people who want to engage in this group chat, I will make the discord group!! edit: i have now created the group but since the link is only valid for a day, please comment below (with your study level and subjects) if you want to join and i will send you the new link!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>due to this digital age, it's rare most of us use pen and paper for everything but what you could do is first note down everything digitally then after organising everything you could write it down. i do this so that 1) i don't waste paper and 2) it's more efficient. this is what I do for taking down notes in class and then transfer everything into paper. if you are annotating a book then i would directly annotate the physical copy as honestly (for me) it is harder to annotate the ebook version compared to the physical copy. if you don't want to re-write, you could invest in some coloured paper (that looks yellow-ish/ beige) and print on it and it would look better compared to printing on white paper. after that, you can do annotations on that paper. efficient and DA at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As long as you have a minimum of five subjects, you are good to go. However, I would advice you not to abandon that subject (if it's not a coursework subject). I never actually did well in Physics and I disliked it. Yet, I was advised not to throw it away and I was glad I didn't since I attained an A\* in it. Yes, you might not like that subject but my advice is this: Since it is only IGCSE not A levels or IB, just do the subject. You may never know if you need that subject in the future or wish to pursue it later. Mostly students take 8 subjects for the reason of eliminating five subjects for A levels AFTER trying all 8 subjects. However, if it is a coursework subject, then it would be worthwhile to change to something else as coursework takes up alot of your time. Doing something you don't enjoy would be a waste of time. Even if you changed this subject next year, what is to say you won't enjoy/ find the subject difficult too? Every subject have its own difficulties and its mundane in their own way. In conclusion, I would suggest (as long as its not a coursework subject) to stick with it. At least a few of your subjects is something you will never see yourself doing in the future but that doesn't mean you cast it aside (that's why the minimum number of IGCSE subjects to get into university is 5 and the minimum for a "Best Across" certificate is 8 subjects). A humanities students doesn't need science but it is highly expected of them to at least undertake the basics of it. I wouldn't worry too much on this matter if I were you. For all I know, my own dislike to a subject only pushed me harder to do better. I really hope this helped. If you every need any other help, feel free to DM me! Have a good day! :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe it wouldn't affect your grade, but it could affect what your teachers write about you in the testimony? Since many are shirking away work now, they are maybe taking the last ditch effort to distinguish who are actually motivated and who aren't? Not that this would affect the grades, since even the lowest academic scorer could be the person most motivated to study but for remarks I guess. You could be predicted A\*A\*A\* but no university would want to take in a student who doesn't have a genuine love for studying and tosses away the priority of studying once told that whatever their effort was put into is no longer reap them any good. At least this is something universities consider heavily (the person's motivation) in normal circumstances hence I think it also will still contribute heavily now. A person's predicted grades and self-driven motivation to study should be present (and this is also something they look through UCAS so this is no new thing). I mean this is what I think, since the teachers are going to be writing remarks to back up as part of proof for your predicted grades along with mocks and other test results. Please don't quote me on this. This is just what I think. I might be wrong too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! I am looking to apply for Classics or Classics and English this fall but I am confused with English Language requirements. This what it says: **Exemptions from this requirement will be considered for applicants who have:** * studied the International Baccalaureate programme, if it is taught in English * studied the Singapore Integrated Programme (SIPCAL) #160; * been educated full-time in the medium of the English language throughout the two most recent years before the 15 October application deadline, and who remain in full-time education conducted in the English language until the end of the school year in their home country. I am a Singaporean but I am currently homeschooling. I am no longer doing SIPCAL (I have not finished it) so I definitely do not fall under that category. I have been studying full-time in the medium of English Language but as I am not studying in a school, does it count? Additional info: I am 16 doing CIE A levels this November (not Singapore-Cambridge A levels) as a private candidate. I did IGCSE last November for all my subjects. I left school in Secondary 3/ Year 10 in British Curriculum for personal reasons (the year before O levels/ IGCSE) and self-studied IGCSE by myself. If anyone could tell me if I have met the English requirements, I will be eternally grateful!!! I am really worried about this and it would be fantastic if someone could clarify. Thank you!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in a reverse position of yours actually. I am a Singaporean with British qualification looking to study in the UK. My advice is that if you want something that is eurocentric and to take PPE, it is more worth staying in Europe. Although NUS is ranked really high, it is not as worth it as Yale-NUS. If you get into Yale-Nus, that would be worth it. Also, although NUS is ranked really well for humanities, the modules are not as flexible (well Yale-NUS is). I know many would disagree with my statement (*how could it be true? NUS is ranked 11th and is world-renowned!*) but seriously, I have researched hard into this and a UK degree is more worth it. Yale-NUS is totally worth it, NUS isn't. Most Yale-NUS students successfully get into Oxford, Cambridge and other Russel Groups unis. So you will be quite set for your life if you get into it. UCL and Yale-NUS atmosphere is literally the same. UCL is more research-based so it makes your CV better when applying to Oxford as you will have more chances in research rather than Yale-NUS, which is more holistic and like an American university. Both are equally the same. Now all you have to wonder about is the cost- as an international in Singapore, it's damn expensive.Is it really worth it? On the other hand, Yale-NUS is best known for its South East studies so studying a european linear degree in Singapore is not the best choice. I know many Singaporeans will say otherwise but as a person who have studied both the Singaporean and British syllabus, I know how much better a european qualification is compared to a singaporean one. This is applies to the degrees too. Singapore, I actually can't believe how much I am criticising my own country ahahah, does not promote research. You fund it by yourself, you do the work, you *may* be noticed. It's a huge reason why many Singaporeans who prefer research go overseas. There's no point doing research in a country where it is minimally valued. Hope this helped!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>igcse? so private candidate or international i guess? (i did igcse last year too as a private candidate). i don't know why every poly would reject you but email the polys with an appeal letter. if you still aren't accepted in, then i guess it's more worth it to do international A levels rather than wait till next year intake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you think you're bad in math and still want to keep your options open, take economics. that may eradicate all the med and math related things in uni but at least you will be able to open social science. to open up humanities you need at least two essay based subjects. i don't know exactly what you want to study but i think this will be a great combination for you: Math (AS level- if you want), Economics, Literature/ History (or both) and maybe if you want like natural science or something you can take biology. I wouldn't recommend you take physics or chemistry at all if you are bad at math. taking just bio is useless without math but would be useful for subjects like natural science. i wouldn't recommend you take a language unless you are really good at it, but taking a foreign/ modern language does help in alot of language related subjects. this combination opens up as many options as possible without much maths. you might need to take 4 A levels rather than 3 to keep the options open but it will be worth it by the end of sixth form when you choose your major. so there's thta,, hope this helps!!!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well I'm an Indian living in Singapore!! I haven't much Indians either and I'm quite thrilled to know one!!! Just for context: do you usually wear Western clothes or Chudidar? Okay this is what I think can be done; Long sleeve turtlenecks!!!! (They may tight and hug the body but they are long-sleeve and thus socially acceptable in India), Long pants or Jeans (well in India they always wear this so this isn't a problem), If you are living in the city you can get away with knee-length skirts (if you live in Delhi, I know they allow you to wear mini-skirts with stockings and that is so DA because it's like a private school uniform), Rayon white blouses!!!! (So basically don't get anything colourful I guess, just eep to green, black, beige and white) I just tried to suggest what I know is socially acceptable,, if you don't care about social acceptable then just DM me I will hit you with a whole list of what you can wear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess it depends on how you qualify best? If you mean best as in most developed character, Snape would definitely be. If you mean best as in most selfless, any main and their supporting characters would be. If you mean best as in portrayal and execution, Draco and Dumbledore definitely would be. If you mean best as in morality, then we have the Trio, Dobby, Dumbledore's Army, the Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid, Luna, Neville, the Weasleys, well basically all those who fought for Harry's side. If you mean best as in persuasively make you feel an intense emotion towards the character, then Umbridge, Snape, the Dursleys and Professor McGounagall would definitely be. And if you mean fan favourites, we have Lupin, Sirius and James. In my personal bias i looooove hermione and luna so yepp there's there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CIE: Offering notes and advice for 0486 Literature</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 15:09:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit: I have realised that the poems for songs of ourselves part 1 has changed; so if i email-ed that to you, please ignore it. for romeo and juliet and a separate peace there is no change so if you want notes for these two set texts you can DM me :)) Hi everyone! Last November I took my iGCSEs and did well for my Literature! I have posted a couple of times before offering notes and advice for essays. As that was some time ago, I am re-extending the offer. If you would like notes for Romeo and Juliet, A Separate Peace and Songs of Ourselves 1, DM me with your email so I can add you to the google drive! If you would like me to give you tips mark your essays, I would love to! I really want as many people to get that A\*!! If you follow all these advice, an A or A\* is in your bag! **For revision:** 1. Read your set texts at least three times fully! I personally re-read my set texts like 30 times for maximum retention. I did not memorise any quotes but rather tried to understand and evaluate every chapter/ act/ line as I go. 2. Make a document/ hand-written notes for themes and character traits. Many overlook this in their revision. I cannot stress how important this is! 3. Essays, essays, essays! Loads of them! You have no idea how much I underestimated in the beginning of my year. I am so glad I didn't shirk off my essays and did every one of them. Understand that alot of questions are similar (not exact) so you can generally fit your answers to the question by tweaking your answer a little. \[This I personally found useful as the duration of the exam is really short. There is barely any time for planning.\] 4. Know your analysis thoroughly, not your quotes. I have seen so many students from school memorising countless of quotes (by the way I'm homeschooled). At iGCSE level, you are not at all expected to memorise quotes for word to word, nor do they expect you to quote it to word to word in your essay (unless you are taking Paper 3; which is still not a worry since it is an open-book exam). Tell me, what is there to gain for quoting word to word? At most, impress your examiners, maybe even that 1 extra mark if they are generous. But if your essay is low-quality analysis, forget it. You aren't going to get that 1 extra mark. I don't care what your teachers say. Note that the examiners last look of the essay is the conclusion. There is no evidence to be put in there. So basically **analysis  gt; quotes**. The time could be put to better use crafting stronger analysis and reading more sources. 5. Do not panic if you don't understand some poems. There is a reason why there are 15 poems. You aren't suppose to a) memorise them; b) be extremely thorough with each and every one of them. Sure, to be safe, you have to be thorough. But personally, I think that just induces more panic. For me, I did not understand the use of hyphens and capital letters in Cold in the Earth \[Songs of Ourselves Part 1\]. Since I couldn't understand it's language, I just made sure more familiar with the themes and then left it alone, choosing to invest more in other poems that I actually could understand. Why did I study the themes instead of completely abandoning it? That is because in exam, there are two types of questions for poem. The first is more specific to language and imagery. The second is more concerned about the message of the poems. Thus, I wouldn't panic. Just play to your strengths. **For novels/ short stories:** 1. There is absolutely no need to know the whole novel word to word. So I took Separate Peace and this is what I did; I just summarised what happened in each chapter. That's all. From there I made more heavy analysis. 2. Know your characters. Character traits, character developments, what are their influences to other characters, how does the book portray them, what are they associated with, etc. For example in A Separate Peace they associated Brinker with winter and Finny with summer \[motifs and symbols\]. Leper was a shy boy who then became insane \[character development\]. Gene is an unreliable narrator \[portrayal\] and has no identity- he lives through Finny \[influences\]. This is what I meant by analysis. Very simple and straightforward but very very effective. 3. Themes, symbols, motifs. The usual. It's very valuable. 4. Now you might ask- but how about extract-based? If I don't analyse deeply every single word, wouldn't I not be able to answer it? Again to reinforce this. Your questions would always be how did the author portray/ create something. That is mostly your themes, motifs, symbols and characters. Think about what is before the extract and what is after. As much as you are supposed to answer to the extract, somewhere in your conclusion paragraph you must acknowledge that did is part of a greater text and you must think of its effect/ growth/ etc. **For plays:** Note: If you are doing Romeo and Juliet just DM me right away and I will just give you a link to my notes and bunch of websites that you just must read. If you are doing Shakespeare in general, I can help you too although not specific to the text but context. 1. Themes! Deception, Love, Marriage, Women, Power, Language and Communication, Societal Class, Social Norms, Honor. These are the most common themes. 2. Character traits! 3. Motifs! 4. Symbols! 5. Language! How does the play writer portrays this certain person? Like for Shakespeare, a person of lower social status is always some bumbling fool and a higher class to be immaculate. Also (for Shakespeare), does he use malapropism? Double entendre? What is the intended effect of it? What is the expected tone? and most importantly, WHY? Why this scene? What happened in the previous scene? Like for Shakespeare, I know he timely places a scene full of jest right after a scene full of severe tidings. Always remember, it IS PART OF A BIGGER PLAY!!!! 6. Tropes! This *especially* for Shakespeare. The "Fool" always happen to be the wisest. The women always put down. The feisty always ending up dead. If you are doing the "OR" option, this is something you must be extremely familiar with. 7. This is the most important yet the most overlooked. Why? Because our teachers tells us all not to involve too much in the background of the play. And why do they say this? Because precautions. Some just write their entire essay on Shakespeare's childhood. So the teachers all go *better safe than sorry.* It's kind of like how our English teachers advise us not to write about death and dreams in our narrative essays. But this, in my experience, was what saved me that A\*. For my Romeo and Juliet essay last November, I got the question "Who has Shakespeare made you feel more sympathy for- Romeo or Juliet" or something like that. This is what I did. I referred to everything in the Elizabethan age. These were my three points; 1) both are susceptible to sonnets (Italian sonnets- Petrarch). On the same note for Romeo, he knows dueling (an Italian concept for honor) and Italian fighting terminology. In my observation all those who knew anything Italian related died. Thus on this point I felt sympathy for both. 2) Inevitability. The Prologue. Their death was inevitable. Nothing they did could change it. Now I did this- I brought in what the audience would think, watching the play build up. Remember this is a play and there will always be a need to address the audience. 3) To show that Juliet had more sufferings, I brought in the fact about women in Elizabethan society. It was the reason why she married in secret and was ready to leave her family. Which led to her death. Literally in all of my three points I point the blame to their society of Shakespeare's time so I can elicit *different points from my other literature exam-takers.* Most would just write about Juliet being a woman and Romeo's fate written from the start but SO WHAT? That is the question! Why is it so bad to be a woman? Because women in Elizabethan society... 8. AUDIENCE! WE ARE NOT JUST ANALYSING A TEST, WE ARE ANALYSING A PLAY!! You must think- what would the audience think/ react to a scene. What can the audience see that is disturbing? How does it look like on the stage. pLEASE. You must highlight this is your essay! It's a play guys come on. **For poems:** 1. Language, imagery, assonance, all of that. Remember- VISUAL and AUDITORY 2. Themes! 3. I personally wrote out all the poems on a separate piece of paper and analysed them by myself then checked with the poem analysed with my teacher to see how accurate my analysis is. **For essays:** 1. *Intro:* Not more than 3 lines. Answer the damn question. "The poet successfully conveys \_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_." Done. Nothing more, nothing else. No one else cares when the person was born or what influenced the particular work. No one cares. 2. *Paragraphs:* ALWAYS WRITE 3 POINTS!!!! NOT ANY LESS THAN THAT! If you can write a fourth point just to be safe, do it. Although I don't think you would have time for that except for Paper 4. Each paragraph is supposed to have a point, evidence, elaboration, link. Very mechanical. iGCSE expects nothing more from you. Be mechanical. When you get to A levels then you can go your style. Till then, it's best you get that marks rather than be rebellious and go against the prescribed norms. 3. *Keywords for paragraphs:* The poet/author portrays/ suggests \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. **\[answer the question every first line of each of your three paragraphs.\]** This is evident when \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. **\[if you have an exact quote, then quote it; if not write briefly what the evidence is.\]** This shows that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. This implies that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. \[evaluation is the most important thing.\] Furthermore, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **\[if you ever have to insert contextual knowledge, here is where you do it.\]** *(also remember to link this contextual knowledge to why it is important to this point).* Therefore/ Hence/ Thus, the poet/ author \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as it promotes/ portrays \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. **\[ALWAYS LINK! EXAMINERS ARE ALWAYS DISMAYED WHEN YOU DON'T LINK BACK.\]** 4. *Conclusion:* Conclusion is your most important part of the essay. Why? Because that is the first and last thing your examiner will read. They will flip to the end of your essay at the beginning of marking your paper to see what they should expect of your essay. Then they read it at the end to see if you have tied up all your arguments. So what is expected of a conclusion? First and foremost, it is not the listing of your points! That should be your intro! Your conclusion is evaluation of all points *together.* What is a common thing you see running through your points. Is there a certain point that is more prominent than the other? 5. *Personal evaluation:* This should be inserted in either your conclusion or your strongest PEEL paragraph. Just two-three lines. What do you think of this point? Does it suit the rest of the text? Does it make sense? Do you agree? Don't overdo this- literally only two lines please. It's just supposed to get you that last push to full marks. In conclusion, remember **PEEL-** *Point, Evidence, Elaboration, Link.* **For unseen:** 1. Every point is valid. No matter how stupid. Don't trust me on this? I will tell you what I wrote (you can refer 0486/o/n/43/19 for the paper i took). I fking wrote that the guy who was not bothered by staring was NOT HUMAN. Now, that point is surely not true since I took it upon me to research what text it was after my exam. But I STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND DEVELOPED MY ARGUMENT. How? First point- the scene and atmosphere. Second- a normal human vs that guy. How he just smiles creepily. Third, the description of that guy. Very specific to language and imagery. To be safe I wrote a fourth point- quinn in latin means fifth. He could be in his fifth body. Also "quinn rhymes with sin". I remember that quote exactly- haunts me till today. That was my favourite point that was a reach but I supported it well by building it up through all my paragraphs. THEN, I tied it all together with a good conclusion; referring how each point I wrote built up to my conclusion. Honestly one of my best essays considering the fact that it had one of the most unique points and I MANAGED TO PULL OFF A TRICKY ASSUMPTION with good, linked points. That my friends is how you do it. Go big or go home. 2. Remember there is no correct answer for unseen. 3. You can't practice for this. Just get familiar with the essay structure. 4. PLAN YOUR ESSAY!!!! YOU HAVE *1 HOUR 15 MINUTES!!!!* Half an hour more than the usual essay. PLAN!!!!! All in all, this is what I did. This is what got me my A\*. However, this overly simplified. If you need anything for A Separate Peace, Songs of Ourselves Part 1 or Romeo and Juliet, DM me. If you want me to mark your essays, also DM me. Any tips for especially drama texts (since this is my personal strength), DM me. I hope to make everyone happier with a good grade on their results!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi!! I'm looking to apply for Oxford's Classics and English undergrad this fall for 2021 entry. I see that I have to take two admission tests for it on November 4th. However, I also happen to have my CIE A levels exam for Literature Paper 4 on the same day. How do I negotiate between these exams? I most certainly can't skip my A levels nor can I skip my admission tests. I wanted to ask here for some advice before I emailed the admissions office. \[By the way I'm a homeschooler from Singapore taking CIE A levels as a private candidate at British Council.\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what subject do you want to do in uni? if i has nothing to with math, then there's no point. igcse math is nowhere close to AS level math. someone i know got a 3 in igcse math and then A in AS math. another person i know got a 9 in igcse math and then got a D in AS math. there is nothing about the grade in igcse that contributes/ predicts to what you may achieve in AS level. if you want to do math it should be because you 1) really need it for your course; 2) you genuinely like math. i really hope this helps! don't be pressured to maths unless you really have/ want to!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questions on Undergrad for Classics</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-15 07:12:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! I am 16 years old and doing an A levels students doing CIE A levels for Classical Studies, English Literature and History for this oct/nov 2020 series. I have asked a few questions here before and it has been super helpful and I would love it if someone could give me some suggestions and advice! As a homeschooler doing A levels in 8 months instead of the usual 24 months has squashed out any way to study the Cambridge Latin Course. Especially now that I have only 5 more months to my exam, and 4 for my UCAS, I don't particularly think I would have time for it at all. I have done 2 Latin extremely short courses on OpenLearn and I am not sure if it adds any value at all to my Personal Statement. If anyone could point me to an online Latin course that is 1) not longer than a month, 2) effectively covers the basics of Latin grammar and vocab, 3) adds value to my Personal Statement, and 4) not expensive,I would be ever so grateful. I know Duolingo doesn't add any value at all so I am really stressed about this fact. I really love this language and I at least want to show that I know I can cope with this language. I know it's not necessary but I really want to. Another question I do have: is there any way I could embark on a scholarship? For context, I am from Singapore but I didn't achieve the best grades in my iGCSE. It was decent but not the usual Oxford level. I have barely an extra-curriculars other than a hopeful podcast. As an international I am aware I have to pay ALOT (I am looking to study in the UK and I will be applying this fall) and I was just wondering if there are any scholarships? The few universities I am looking at now is Oxford, Durham, King's, Manchester and either UCL or Edinburgh. I know this makes me sound like some elitist trying only for top unis but I prefer these unis mainly because of the modules offered. The last question I have is just more for clarification. If say I do get my undergrad at UK uni, will I be able to complete my bachelors and masters at the same time? Then start a pHD right after that? I know this sounds stupid but I kind of really want to take BA Classics and English, MPhil and then a pHD. Or is there a way to skip masters and go straight into pHD for Classics? I have two reasons for this; 1) I can't pay for the living costs and accommodation after 4 years, I only have enough money for that, and 2) I am hoping to become an academic or some sort like that so I can embark on research, etc. I know this really sounds stupid but I don't know who else to ask since I am homeschooled and I don't have teachers or counselors. I do know that if you are really passionate about something, you shouldn't rush it but as I taking a degree that few know about in Singapore, I kind of have to be realistic about it and try to make the best of it. I really am just asking to clarify because there is no one else for me to ask and not seem like I am snobbish and want to rush everything. If anyone could help me clarify any of these, thank you very much :)) I hope all of you have a great day and stay safe in these trying times!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hmmm it would help if you could tell me where exactly are you from? i'm from singapore and over here there are only 3 to 4 schools who offer internal exams for private candidates. not every school provides it. if i were you i would specifically call up the school you wish to take your exams with and ask them. i did that and managed to narrow it down to the few schools that provided them. i know in america this is very common but since im not exactly sure where you are from i cant advice specifically. but i can assure you one thing; it is not true for all schools that offer exams for private candidates. usually on a website when they say they provide exams for private candidates it is often referring to external (the actualy igcse) not internal exams. so you need to specifically call them. word of advice: as a homeschooler, universities doesn't need any actual school transcripts. you only need the external exams.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! You aren't late! You have 3 more months to the deadline! I'm guessing you are doing *CBSE*? There isn't such thing as a double major in *Psychology and Business* in Oxbridge but if you want to go to a "reputable university" in the international rankings (since if you are returning back to India after undergrad, you need to go to a university that is most commonly heard of; even though a lot of people say that you shouldn't aim "top unis", as my parents were from India, I know how important a top university is to get a job in India) , you can consider Scotland universities? *University of Edinburgh and University of St Andrews* are flexible with their modules so you would be able to take a Psychology degree with a few modules in Business. There is no need for *SAT/ACT.* That's only for US. Just take *IELTS* in the nearest British Council to your state in India. *CBSE English* is not enough to prove First Language Proficiency. If you are applying this fall to enter 2021 into university here are the important dates: *October 15*: **Deadline for Oxbridge Admissions, Medicine and Law Pathways** \[Note: You can only apply to one; submit by UCAS with your personal statement and necessary essays/ courseworks) *Mid-December*: If you are selected, you will be asked for an **interview**. As you have an Indian passport, you are not expected to fly over, instead they will just call you through Skype. *Mid-January*: Oxbridge results will be out *January 15*: Deadline for applying to any other universities through UCAS You will have to apply through UCAS. Below are some links for you to research. UCAS: [https://www.ucas.com/](https://www.ucas.com/) \[You must apply to any universities to England here. You can apply up to five.\] Oxford 2021 Admissions Timeline: [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/admissions-timeline?wssl=1](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/admissions-timeline?wssl=1) Oxford Admissions for International Students: [http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students) Oxford Courses List: [http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing) For Grades necessary for India: [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students/international-qualifications?wssl=1](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students/international-qualifications?wssl=1) Colleges at Oxford University \[You have to apply to which college you want to go to in Oxford\]: [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/a-z-of-colleges?wssl=1](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/a-z-of-colleges?wssl=1) English Language Requirements: [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students/english-language-requirements?wssl=1](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students/english-language-requirements?wssl=1) \^\^ Everything I linked above may be specific to Oxford but is inter exchangeable to other universities.

    <TEXT>I'm a Singaporean who is homeschooling CIE A levels. It might be true to an extent that we are very hardworking but if you think about it, most students who are doing CIE comes from International Schools and those who choose to homeschool (like me). So the whole idea about Singaporeans pulling up the grade thresholds would already be wrong since majority do Singapore-Cambridge A Levels not CIE and most international schools here perform well but not like the usual super smart level the media always portray Singaporeans as. As a person who studied in India for a term too, majority of them do ISC/CBSE or IB and very few do A levels. So i guess it does dispell the myth that *since the smart countries take these exams, it pulls up the grades.* I would say the **real reason** for such high grade thresholds is because of the disproportionate amount of people for different grades. For example, for the subject History, 0.9% gets A\* whilst an A\* for Information Technology is 0.1% and Further Maths is 3%. Basically what I mean is that every year, the examiners just choose some number of students to get A\*. So one year an A\* could have 10% and in another year could be 2%. But yeah truthfully, CIE is very very competitive and thus they need to raise the bar so that not everyone will get an A\*. It is not because of specific countries per say but just as a whole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just gonna put this out there: you could be the best at languages or understand your formulas very well and it's going to do very little for you. It is important to understand obviously. But what is more beneficial to getting an A\* for IGCSE is just basically knowing **how to answer the questions**. If you are more bent in getting an award than long-term understanding, you have to do an insane load of question papers. Trust me on this, it gets you more marks. Not full marks. But most. The other comment by u/Chessativ is right. I literally thought it was about understanding until I sat down and got 70% in one of my practice papers 3 months prior to exam. After that I just literally did question papers and managed hit close to full marks. I understood all the trends of the questions. In another exam board this might not work. It will also not work in A levels. But apparently this is the best way for IGCSE. So I guess you gotta choose between long-term understanding or short-term scoring marks. Understanding can only take you so far in IGCSE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>fam, you don't have to do what they tell you. why not show them the countless rankings and reviews that shows them that imperial is by leaps and bounds better in STEM? that's one way to calm them down and get them to accept it. another way is just that you have 5 options for UCAS. you can apply to oxbridge as a possible option (and back-up option just in case since imperial is extremely tough to get in). once you get your offers, you can choose by yourself. i have asian parents too and they are obsessed with rankings. lucky for me i actually do want to get into oxford because i love the atmosphere. only issue i face is that if i dont get into oxford, i want to get into durham but their international rankings are not the best. and my parents wont let me go there but really, show them the countless articles where they compare imperial to be better than oxford. show them how much better the employment opportunities are there. trick is a harsh word but that's kind of the best way in the short-term to win over your parents approval.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>uhh have you checked the cie website? in fact the timetables you have every year, not just this year will be subject to revision until August.  gt;*Sometimes, we need to revise the final timetable after it has been published. Please check the version available on this page regularly. You can find the version number at the bottom of the page of your selected timetable. We will tell you about any changes we make to the timetable in the Exams Officer eNewsletter* This info is always there. So far, in the past two months since this timetable has been released nothing has changed. Three days back they added this:  gt; Covid-19 update: The global situation with the Covid-19 pandemic means we are not holding our international examinations in the May/June 2020 series in any country. We expect our November series to go ahead as normal. We will provide a number of syllabuses in the November 2020 series that are normally only available in the June series. The list of syllabuses is provided on our [Covid-19 support pages](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/covid/additional-syllabuses-offered-for-november-2020-series/). So if you enter the Covid-19 page, they have already confirmed the syllabuses that would be in November: [https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/covid/additional-syllabuses-offered-for-november-2020-series/](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/covid/additional-syllabuses-offered-for-november-2020-series/) **The timetable is not invalid.** It has simply not been revised. The current dates right now will **not** change. They will only add the subjects listed in the website. **AS OF NOW**, these timetables are the "finalised" ones. Like every year. Nothing new this year. [https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/exam-administration/cambridge-exams-officers-guide/phase-1-preparation/timetabling-exams/exam-timetables/](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/exam-administration/cambridge-exams-officers-guide/phase-1-preparation/timetabling-exams/exam-timetables/) The registration for CIE is **already open**. Please go and check it. The dates are already released. [https://help.cambridgeinternational.org/hc/en-gb/articles/115004304649-Final-Entries-FAQs](https://help.cambridgeinternational.org/hc/en-gb/articles/115004304649-Final-Entries-FAQs) As you can see 16th of August is the deadline. Just in case you don't trust me or some shit, they updated this on **2nd of July**. So unless we are not talking about the same exam board, these are the finalised ones. The exam dates for these additional subjects, as cie have already explained, **will be added later**. That doesn't mean the whole timetable is invalid because that means every goddamn year we will only know the "real" exam dates one month before the exam date. They have already updated this on the website. Obviously due to the current pandemic they will keep updating every few weeks. It's your job to keep an eye out for it. Every year (not just this year), there is always something that will change by August. But till then, you have to go with what they give you if not you might as well just not call anything valid or finalised. Also by the way, when they said they didn't have any dates, they were not referring to the november subjects timetable but the june syllabus that was brought forward to oct/nov series. Don't confuse them!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm I think Rick Riordan's is *still* okay? Mainly because his different series are all manifestations of different mythology or characters. The Kane Chronicles came out first and that was Egyptian. Then of course the success of PJO. And I think HOO is definitely necessary after PJO. The Magnus Chase series only had a small link to PJO and so did the short stories that came after Kane Chronicles. I am not personally a huge fan of TOA mainly because my fav characters are all dying and the whole Apollo thing is just... well yeah it feels like it is a little forced. Extremely interesting plot honestly but I think the whole riordanverse could do without TOA? I think the reason why alot of people don't feel swamped by Rick Riordan yet (or at least those who are extremely into the books) find that the links makes sense you know? But I don't really want a series after TOA timeline. I think that would be a bit of a stretch. Maybe if he focuses on drawing links to the other series he has been writing and has already established links on. So far I would say because his plot holds strongly it is still okay. But yeah I totally agree that any thing after TOA (the current series) is going to be too far. I think he should end the timeline there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rewatching the whole show and Void Stiles in Season 3B is honestly the best</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-13 11:50:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I kind of wished there were more scenes with Void Stiles because Dylan's acting is holy shit amazing. Or at the very least in the later seasons give him another "villain-y" role to play. He is just so good at it. And oh my god I don't know what I'm going to do when I finish rewatching the whole show again. Edit: I think my fav quote in Season 3 would be "It's your dream. Take responsibility for it. Just shut up and go back to sleep". \[stiles to danny\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually fully expected that sort of storyline in 6B. Since in every season they emphasise at least once about his extreme desire to be an alpha and power, I kind of expected him to be one of the main antagonists in 6B.</TEXT>
