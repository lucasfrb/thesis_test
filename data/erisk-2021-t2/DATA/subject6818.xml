    <TEXT>Tbh, I didn #8217;t put this in the post, but she later ended up pressing false accusations on him, they #8217;re battling it out to this day, but it had no relation to the entitled parents part. I didn #8217;t know if the dad part was really necessary but I figured why not add that in. Sorry again this is my first reddit post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't believe so since it happed about 3-4 years ago I wanna say. The whole situation went away and she eventually came back to our property and stole some things. My dad confronted her (he never laid a hand on her), but being the skinny, short, psychotic woman she is, she cried wolf to the cops saying my dad beat her. That's what they're battling out now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That makes a lot of sense, thank you. And I only started hanging out with him a few weeks ago, but they thinks he #8217;s just weird. My dad said he got about 12 red flags after talking with him for about an hour. He #8217;s a very good looking guy, but I notice he contradicts what he says. For example, he #8217;ll talk about how he doesn #8217;t think a lot of himself or he #8217;s skinny and his frisbees could beat him up, but then a few days ago, theee guys catcalled me when he was with me and we just left the store and he said he could take all three of them. He seems delusional but at the same time insecure. He #8217;s told me stories about situations with huis friends, but then a mutual friend of ours will tell me he said something diffreeebt. I #8217;m not sure what to think of him yet as he #8217;s only a friend and isn #8217;t possessive or flirtatious at all. I #8217;m just keeping my eyes open because normally when my dad or grandma have a vibe about something they #8217;re brought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve grown up in the exact same situation. I was lucky to leave it when I was 12, but didn #8217;t know how bad it actually was until I was 14, me being the naive child I was. I #8217;m 18 and from what I can tell, it #8217;s best to distance yourself from the situation and ask if it #8217;s going to harm you or help you. From what you #8217;ve stated it #8217;s goibg to harm you, mentally and emotionally. It doesn #8217;t matter who they are, a toxic person is a toxic person and it #8217;s best to avoid them if you #8217;re looking to better yourself. You have every right to be angry. A mother has a job to put her child first, before anything else. If she does not then she has failed as not only a mother, but a decent human. Once you have kids you have an obligation to nurture and help them pursue being a better person. Birthing someone doesn #8217;t make them a parent, it just makes them someone who had sex. Anyone can do that. If she is toxic to you, then cut her out completely. It may take years to recover from the neglect, but outs worth it because continuing to associate with that toxic person is only going to prevent you from being happy and healthy.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-02 14:08:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s been two months and I still have dreams about him. Last night was the worst. I dreamt he came over and started holding me, crying of happiness that he saw me. I just wake up knowing it #8217;s not like that and he wants nothing to do with me. He was my best friend for years. We started dating and moved in and everything went down hill. I got diagnosed as bipolar and couldn #8217;t find medication that helped me in time. He talked horribly about me behind my back and kissed my roomate the day he dumped me. You know, the one he told me I shouldn #8217;t worry about. I know he lied about everything but I can #8217;t help but miss how we used to be. We used to talk on the phone every night just because, we helped each other with past issues, it seems that when I needed him most he dropped me. I haven #8217;t self harmed in years but I started again. I don #8217;t know what to do. I #8217;m sleeping around to try to fill the void, I #8217;ve had substance abuse, but nothing takes him off my mind, I don #8217;t know what to do anymore. I #8217;m seeing a psychiatrist and therapist now, and I #8217;m hoping to get better, but it #8217;s still so hard. I just feel like when I #8217;m alone I lose myself in the thought of him. Does anyone have any advice? Update: hello, I don #8217;t know if anyone was wondering ths, but I felt it was best to share. It #8217;s been a couple weeks since I made this post, but I #8217;m happy to say I #8217;ve been clean from cutting for over a week now and my mental health has improved with new medication and my great family and support system. I #8217;ve come to recognize that my relationship was an overall toxic one and it #8217;s best that it has ended. I haven #8217;t had nightmares and I even confronted my ex. I saw him recently in town and didn #8217;t have anxiety or a feeling of sadness when I saw him. I #8217;m proud to say that I am doing better in life, and thank you for the people who have supported me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Am I with a narcissist?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-13 23:33:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>So recently me and my ex got back together and it #8217;s been tough. We #8217;ve been together for three months now and I feel like I #8217;m ignoring the red flags but I don #8217;t know what to do. So recently I found that he was liking photos of half naked girls on Instagram. I asked him not to do that because it made me feel bad because I #8217;m trying to lose weight. He started talking about killing himself and how he #8217;s a piece of sh*t, etc. I dropped it and brought it up again later to which he was angry and frustrated that we  #8220;fight over and over about the same thing. #8221; Later on I asked to go through his phone and he said that I should trust him blindly. I know his password so when he fell asleep I went through it and found messages of him texting these girls of the photos he liked calling them pretty, asking for their twitch, etc. I confronted him about it and he deleted them and said he didn #8217;t know what I was talking about and that I was crazy. I left crying telling him it was over and he didn #8217;t try to stop me. He said things like  #8220;go f*ck so and so. #8221; He accuses me of cheating on him even though I #8217;ve always been loyal. I went back to him soon after leaving that night because I wanted answers and thought that this couldn #8217;t be the end, not after four years. Well, we  #8220;talked #8221; it out, he cried and said  #8220;don #8217;t throw what we have away. #8221; So I decided to give it another chance. My mind wasn #8217;t at ease and I tried going through his phone again but he changed his password. Other girls before us have accused him of cheating but he always denied it. I feel like this can #8217;t be who he really is. I #8217;ve been his best friend for four years he was like my other half, were still together but my mind isn #8217;t at ease. Does anyone have any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really appreciate the advice, yeah it was shitty to go through his phone, but I never do unless I have a gut instinct that I #8217;ll find something. Ever since we met we #8217;ve had these instincts about each other even if we #8217;re far away. It #8217;s been proven over and over that if one of us is upset the other will call to check up out of the blue. Now I #8217;m have instincts that I need to leave, I told him last night that I wanted to leave but I just feel stuck. I feel like I don #8217;t want to throw away four years of friendship and love, but in the last year it #8217;s like we #8217;ve both changed and we #8217;re not good for each other anymore. At one point I really felt like he was my other half, now I just feel like I #8217;ll be lost without him, but I #8217;m planning on leaving if I see one more red flag. He said I need to give him time to prove shit like this will never happen again. I #8217;ll let him try to prove it but my trust is shattered and it #8217;s gonna take a long time to rebuild. Once again, I really appreciate your advice, it #8217;s given me a non bias look on this relationship and I thank you for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My best friend has been in an abusive relationship. We live in the apartment complexes next to each other. Her boyfriend just got out of western state, threatened to kill her, etc. she #8217;s staying at my apartment and he stole all her stuff and serves her an EPO so she couldn #8217;t contact him about her stuff being stolen. Last night he came to my apartment and popped her tires but he got the title switched to his name so there #8217;s nothing she can do about her stolen stuff or car. He #8217;s gonna keep doing this stuff and the police have been less than useless. They said she needs to file an EPO, but what good is that gonna do when he already has one? How can the cops tell who #8217;s in violation? I don #8217;t know how to help her get him to stop, it seems there #8217;s nothing we can do. Does anyone have any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been dealing with depression for years now. I thought my boyfriend would be there since he #8217;s been my best friend for years. He #8217;s been at work out of state for two weeks and I haven #8217;t responded to his texts because I wasn #8217;t answering anyone and didn #8217;t want him to worry about me. Well this morning he broke up with me and there #8217;s nothing I can do. I was looking forward to having our first Christmas together with him being home. I #8217;m devastated and don #8217;t know where to go. I #8217;m relapsing into my suicidal state. I just spent half an hour in the bath waiting to slit my wrists and choke down a bottle of pills. I couldn #8217;t find the courage to do it. He #8217;s the only man I #8217;ve ever loved and I have for a fourth of my life. I #8217;m 19 and met him when I was 14. I #8217;m so lost. My friends and family say he was emotionally abusive and cheating on me. I ignored the red flags, and I still would if he told me he loved me and still wanted me. I just want to be held in his arms again. I love this man with all my heart. I just feel like there #8217;s no way out of this pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I almost attempted last night. I #8217;d been drinking and decided I #8217;d smoke my last cigarette. When I came back inside I sat down and put my ID next to me and put the gun in my mouth. Next thing you know I get a notification from my phone, someone had commented on a reddit post I made about a month or so ago in r/depression. I find it amazing how this person was able to find my post, and tell me that I #8217;m worthy of life. The crazy thing is this person made a Reddit account one hour before I was going to end it. They said they felt guided to my post and felt like they needed to make an account that day. They told me that god loved me and I put away the gun. I felt like a different person. I don #8217;t believe in god but this has made me question it for sure. I still have some pain, but I feel like a new perspective over everything has washed over me. I hope this comment helps someone the way this person helped me. Everyone is worthy of life. Hardships will come and it #8217;s up to us to get past it because the hard truth is we can #8217;t rely on anyone but ourselves, but it #8217;s never to late to reach out for help. You are loved and you deserve to live happily.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-23 07:17:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been clean from cutting for about ten months now. I have a huge scar on my leg from where I just dug a knife into it when I blacked out. I just took a drive to try to get things off my mind. I drove all over town and the country side. I wanted to stop at the overpass, and I thought about just jumping off of it. That would be the easiest way right? I wouldn #8217;t feel it, my family wouldn #8217;t find a decomposed body days or weeks later in my apartment. I #8217;ve written so many notes and ended up throwing them away. I #8217;ve sat with my ID next to me while holding a shotgun in my mouth, I #8217;ve laid down in the tub ready to swallow pills and slit my wrists but every time I feel I #8217;ll never go through with it. I don #8217;t feel sad. I can #8217;t cry. I feel empty like this will never end. I #8217;m 19 and this is the only feeling I #8217;ve known for my whole life. At what point does this pain end? Is there anything better? I can #8217;t trust, I think I make new friends but it #8217;s just guys trying to sleep with me. The only reason I haven #8217;t self harmed is for the few people that I don #8217;t want to hurt. My Granny, my dad and my little sister. If it wasn #8217;t for them I wouldn #8217;t even be here anymore. My granny has been through so much, losing three kids, a husband. My dad is the only son still alive and he #8217;s told me countless times he needs both his baby girls to get through life. I fear if I kill myself my dad would, or my granny would have a heart attack, or god knows what would happen to my sister. I just don #8217;t see a way out of this. I #8217;m on medication but I still feel so empty and depressed. I don #8217;t want to go on but I don #8217;t want to put my family through anymore agony. My family knows about my past self harm and my dad begged me to never do it again. I miss the razor though. I miss those few moments of pain that don #8217;t even compare to what I go through everyday. I miss the blood on my leg as a distraction. I miss just sitting there in utter bliss thinking this is the happiest I #8217;ll ever be. Now I just have to drive around or find things to take my mind off it when I #8217;m feeling this way but I can #8217;t. Nothing I do compares to self harm. I feel like I love it more than myself. I just don #8217;t want to be in this life anymore. Everyday is just surreal, going through the motions, hating school and my job. I wish I could drive on a night like tonight and someone just crash into me. I wish I would get robbed and shot in the head. Something so I didn #8217;t have to do it, but I don #8217;t know what would make my family feel worse. Me taking my own life or by the hands of someone else? I just want all of this to be over. I know they love me, but I can #8217;t escape this feeling that I have nothing to live for and they #8217;d be better off. I #8217;m already broken inside so what #8217;s a few more scratches on the outside?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Life is hard, there #8217;s no doubt about that, but your family would miss you despite what you think. No one deserves to lose a child or sibling at such a young age. You are cared for and you are loved. Please reach out for help. Maybe therapy or medication would help, but please don #8217;t take your own life. You are important and there #8217;s a reason you are here</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the exact feeling. I grew up in an abusive household and right after I left it thought I found the love of my life. We just broke up and I know what you #8217;re feeling. That you #8217;ve become cautious about trusting because you automatically expect the worst from people, but there are people out there who don #8217;t want to hurt you. You will find more people in life that love you and only want to see you succeed. I think feeling sadness is better than feeling numb because at least you feel something. Crying feels good because it lets all those bottled up emotions out. You #8217;re life is worth more than what you think, and someday you will find that meaning. You #8217;ll find someone for you, and you #8217;ll succeed just keep trying and hang in there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes parents go through things and say things they don #8217;t mean. When I was little I heard my dad scream at my mom  #8220;I never wanted kids #8221; it was heartbreaking at the time, but I brought it up to him years later and he said he feels a regret saying that everyday because me and my sister were the best things that ever happened to him. Parents slip up and make mistakes, no parent is perfect. I don #8217;t know you, but you are worthy of love, and in time your mother will regret saying those things to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really appreciate that, it means a lot. I just don #8217;t feel like I have many people to talk to. My ex turned most of my friends against me. He #8217;s manipulative and through the past two years it #8217;s just gotten worse. I live with him so there #8217;s not much I can do about it, I often think just going in the bathroom and cutting would help take my mind off him, but you #8217;re right it would hurt my family and that #8217;s the last thing I want to do. You can reach out to me as well if you ever need to talk</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everything you just said was so inspiring and clear. I can #8217;t put into words how much I feel for you and I #8217;m proud of you for getting clean. You #8217;re a strong person and I #8217;m so happy you have your mom there to support you. No parents wants to witness their child going through so much pain. I feel so secure that you shared this. It feels great to know I #8217;m not alone. When you said it was beautiful and brave I felt some kind of confidence in reaching out for help because it #8217;s been so long that I have. It #8217;s been so hard to trust people but knowing everything you said was absolutely true made me feel so much better. The urge to self harm comes mostly at night when you feel the most alone, but whenever i feel the urge I #8217;m going to read your comment to remind me that I can be stronger than it. Thank you and I wish you the best on your journey to recovery</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congratulations on being two years clean. I know that must #8217;ve been hard to do and I admire your strength. I feel as if doing it for my family helps me stop the most, because without their support in the beginning I would #8217;ve just kept going, but I don #8217;t ever wanna make my dad cry again. It was one of the most heartbreaking sights and I #8217;m sure it was worse for him than me. I will keep going though. I recognize some days will be better than others and some days you just won #8217;t feel anything, but life goes on we just have to keep up with what it throws at us you know?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My family. I couldn #8217;t imagine my little sister growing up and wondering if she was to blame. My granny already having so much loss in her life, and my dad telling me  #8220;I need both my baby girls to be here. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Still getting over it. Was in love with my ex since I was 14, got together when I was 17, moved in together and just recently broke up. Being alone helps a bit since he #8217;s out all the time. I #8217;m sure time and moving out would help but I #8217;m stubborn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My parents used to stick me in front of the TV with scooby doo replaying on the VCR until it broke. Up until I was five or six I would eat dog treats and crawl on all fours because I thought I was a dog. It never ceases to amaze me how mom can make such a funny story out of neglecting her child. Lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went back to self harming. It #8217;s a better alternative to suicide but I told my family I wouldn #8217;t cut again. I would #8217;ve been ten months clean if I hadn #8217;t today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked at a restaurant on campus that sold steak and shakes. I was really angry so I guess customers could tell, I had just make an Oreo Shake with vanilla. So in an angry, ready to quit this fucking job tone, yell in front of over 100 college students,  #8220;VANELLIO SHAKE #8221;. I can #8217;t tell you how much I still hear those laughs to this day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Was at my exes house when he lived with his parents, we were both 16. His parents were very strange, his punishments for being grounded was having his bedroom door taken away, so he put up a blanket with tacks. So we #8217;re in missionary, you can clearly see everything since we were on top of the covers, he pulls out and starts to bust on my chest. Then, dick in hand ejaculating, me under him, his mom walks in. She yells  #8220;oh shit sorry #8221; and turns around and runs out. I mean..I know he doesn #8217;t have a door, but you couldn #8217;t knock on the wall or something? Shit she was the one who bought us condoms when we first started dating. Don #8217;t miss her honestly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m surprised the director didn #8217;t stop the performance for EM and ED to be escorted out. Honestly, it #8217;s just common sense for people to be respectful and quiet when someone is performing, but he still made the good choice for ED to be kicked out of the play entirely. Glad you got your favorite role!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had something similar to this with my mom, but not quite the same situation. My step dad was a real POS, but I guess mom had even gotten on his nerves. Mom screamed in front of me and siblings in the car one day  #8220;you won #8217;t look at me, you won #8217;t touch me #8221;. She started taking her anger out on me more. I don #8217;t know a lot, but what I do know is don #8217;t be an aggressor towards your kids because your partner won #8217;t sleep with you.</TEXT>
