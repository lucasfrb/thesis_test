    <TITLE>Parting Out A Vive... Or Ebay And The Scammer Bane</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-10 02:27:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was in the mix that had credit card charges rejected on the first shipments, a cancelled order, and order reinstatement. In all the confusion and after my original order got cancelled, I placed an "insurance" order just to make sure I would get a Vive "soon". The HTC reps were helpful and got my order somewhat reinstated and said they would cancel the extra order I had placed. Well, they didn't and I wasn't staying on top of my serious e-mail and next thing I knew, I had a shipping notice. I figured what the hell and that I would post it on eBay. And before anyone gets too upset, they aren't going for all that much and after you offer to pay for shipping ($90-140 depending) and eBay takes their cut (10%), people selling on eBay aren't making that much money with current prices. I posted the auction and the guy who won had a Russian name and wanted me to split the payment because he said PayPal wouldn't let him send the whole amount. His shipping address was a reshipping service in Delaware. I told him no and that splitting payment was a typical hook for scammers (which it is). Everything was going to be by the eBay book. He backed out immediately. As a new eBay person, I can't list more than $1000 in a month and am now unable to relist the Vive while everything processes and eBay decides that the sale really did not go through. With HTC shipping so fast, it's doubtful I will be able to even get my money back out and there is always the risk of buyers who claim that the item was broken and demand a refund. Even with a no-refund sale, eBay still comes after you for the amount as a bad seller. So, with an extra Vive that I don't need, I was considering parting it out. There are a number of people here asking about spare parts. That makes the risk to me on any single item low but it wouldn't be an eBay sale. I'm curious if anyone is interested in parts. I am just judging interest as the box is still unopened and pristine. I am not selling the parts yet. Would there be interest in parts from a brand new Vive? Obviously once I open the box I could test the parts on request or just ship them untested if buyers preferred. That way they would be new and totally unused. Please don't tell me you would be interested in parts if you really aren't. I am trying to decide which way to go here. It's less than a week since it even arrived so I could still just return it to HTC and am considering that. I just didn't want to go through the hassle with their customer service being so hard to get hold of and thought if I can't sell it outright, parting it out might help others. What do you guys think? Edit: Thanks for the replies. I'm still trying to get the guy to OK me cancelling the auction. Seems even though he doesn't want to pay, he has the final say in the auction and he has no real motivation to bother with it. Or I wait until it times out for non-payment. EBay is a pain in the ass now that it is so loaded up with scammers. At least half the bidders were reshipper destination addresses. Anyone else thinking of eBay sales should emphasize the common things the scammers try like no split payments, eBay rules, etc.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Little Something Interesting About the EVGA 1080 FE "Great" Rating</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-26 14:53:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you go to the EVGA page for the 980Ti, you can see ratings of the different flavors of 980Ti cards that EVGA makes (http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=06G-P4-4993-KR). The performance ratings go "good", "better", "great", "greater", "ultra", "extreme water", and "ultra extreme". The 1080 Founders Edition is the only card listed so far on the EVGA 1080 card page (http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=08G-P4-6180-KR) and it has a performance rating of "great". Not at the bottom but at the top of the lower half of those ratings. Possibly a foreshadowing of the lineup to come and where the Founders Edition will fit in. No big revelation but just to put the Founders Edition performance level in perspective. Less than 24 hours until they go on sale...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are a bit pricey but I think these are just the ticket with VR Covers. The foam does have a fabric laminated to it for the Velcro to grab and the cuts are actually very nicely done. When /u/vrfoam first posted about these he had said they weren't laser cut but they might as well have been. All in all I'm very impressed. Yep, they do cost a bit but I don't have to mess with finding the proper foam and fabric, laminating them, and then cutting out the gaskets. Recommended!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-09 09:23:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>He was able to fool a bunch of uneducated racists and enough other dumbasses to get himself elected by telling everyone what they wanted to hear or believe. He could excuse his bankruptcies as good business and keep his taxes secret so nobody could actually see he's just a rich kid coasting on bravado. No more. Everything he gets wrong will have consequences for the USA and the world. Putin wants Eastern Europe back. He is going to invade. Russia now has a nuclear first use policy and Putin will move fast from praising Trump to threatening him. Most likely Trump won't want to do anything anyway but Americans probably won't be happy about Russia hopscotching across NATO countries. What will Trump do? His stated position about NATO and Putin will green light Russia while painting Trump into a corner. What does a cornered demagogue Trump do when republicans are up in arms over Russian aggression and expansion? China is also happy to see Trump in office and will be asserting their territorial claims in the South China Sea. As they start challenging all the countries that have legitimate territory there, what does Trump do? His stated positions are clear signals to Russia and China to get busy. Russia and China both easily recognize Trump will probably be a one term president after the USA wakes up in bed with a diseased crazy person as president so expect tanks to roll in Europe very damn soon with threats of full scales nuclear war if the US interferes. China will simply fortify and probably shoot at anything that enters their claimed and illegitimate territory. By Trump being openly hostile to NATO commitments, these are the doors he has opened and the whole world will watch and see his new fuck ups in real time. We basically voted ourselves out of NATO by electing Trump. This is why Putin has meddled and pushed for a Trump win. It's how Wikileaks got fed too much crap for people to sift through right before the election. Putin helped put Trump in office and our uneducated white supremist nationalist population did the rest. This will be the first time in history that Russia has been unopposed with a rabid ex-Stazi and ex-KGB leader at the helm who wants a world dominating Russia. Putin is going to fold Trump, the USA, and Eastern Europe over a chair. China will do the same over in the South China Sea. Trump already lost and so did the world. And Trump's only option will be o go nuclear if he decides to oppose it. Good job, neo-nazis. Hate wins.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Let's Talk Nuclear Exchange With Russia - or Why Trump is So Very Good For Communism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-09 17:16:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Because a nuclear exchange is what is by design in the equation of a possible Russian invasion of NATO allies Latvia and Estonia... Read this: http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation Why is this important? Because we just voted in a president elect that has publicly de-emphasized our NATO commitment. It's a green light for Russia to go ahead and invade them. Russia has moved nuclear-capable missiles up to striking distance of Latvia and Estonia most likely to prepare for "escalating to deescalate". (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1947194/west-on-war-footing-after-russian-troops-mass-at-border-with-latvia-and-putin-moves-nuclear-missiles-closer-to-central-europe/) The Russian doctrine is that if they start losing a conflict, they can respond with nuclear weapons in first use. This is to deter interference in their attacks and expansion under Putin's command as he works to reabsorb the countries that left and sought NATO protection when the Soviet Union dissolved. The USA and NATO, in response to Russian buildups near the Eastern European NATO countries have been flying B-52s loaded with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles into the region as a warning to Russia that if they attack, we defend, and if Russia escalates, we will retaliate. (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-risk-of-nuclear-attack-rises/) This was seen as a way to hold Russia at bay and keep them from even getting into the position of having NATO attack their troops, them get into a losing situation, and popping off nukes. It was working. Now, with Trump backing away from NATO and greatly increasing the risk to NATO allies that they will be invaded, it puts NATO into the position of having to defend those countries alone or simply back down. The UK and France are both NATO members and nuclear powers. If Russia attacks and invades Latvia and Estonia, and NATO defends and tries to push back the Russian invasion, Russia is likely to use their nukes in an escalate to deescalate scenario. But France and the UK would then be in the position of using their nukes in retaliation. Russia sent their own message recently with a missile ad that bragged about MIRVed nuclear warheads on missiles that can wipe out "UK, France, or Texas". There is no mistaking that coincidence in target naming. That's each of the nuclear powers in NATO or a region thereof. (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/25/russia-unveils-satan-2-missile-powerful-enough-to-wipe-out-uk-fr/) And here is the thing. Tensions have been high but Russia was being kept in their cage and not invading Latvia and Estonia. Clinton was at least committed to the NATO pact and that is why Russia was interfering so much in this election and worked so hard at influencing people to think Trump was a good choice. It was really an effective plan and it worked. Good job, right wingers. I'm sure Putin is singing your praises just as much as he is singing Trump's. In one stroke, getting Trump elected both greenlights their invasion of Latvia and Estonia because of Trump's publicly-stated adoration of Putin and aversion to NATO and desire to withdraw, but it also effectively dissolves NATO. France and the UK can't launch their own limited nuclear attack since Russia can just obliterate them with minor damage. With the USA muzzled, France and the UK may be able to threaten other powers but they really aren't a match for Russia. Checkmate. This is why a Trump presidency most likely means Latvia, Estonia, and probably a host of other countries are about to get invaded. And even though they are NATO countries, NATO will just have to sit by and watch. If anyone intervenes, it would probably get really bad really fast. Sorry about that NATO countries. Nice knowing you and too bad about your aspirations for freedom and democracy. Luckily the USA can stand alone against Russia militarily but without NATO, Europe is their oyster. Good luck to you Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Romania, and all the other former Soviet states. So much for whatever was left of Reagan's legacy. And as they fall to Soviet control and the iron curtain sweeps back across Europe, all the other fun stuff that goes along with a greatly expanded communist bloc comes right along with it. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) All without much fuss. Oh, and this time, Russia and China are allies who have agreed to cooperate in espionage and computer attacks against the United States. (http://www.fort-russ.com/2016/08/china-openly-offers-russia-alliance.html, https://jsis.washington.edu/news/china-russia-cybersecurity-cooperation-working-towards-cyber-sovereignty/, http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/05/14/china-russia-seek-new-internet-world-order) Don't forget the China/Russia cooperation in the Middle East. This is why a Trump presidency was and is so important to Putin. We are about to enter a very different world where two countries who used to be manageable are allied against us and actively working to limit our influence and resources. We better get damn self-sufficient and quick. It was the absolute worst thing that could have happened for the free world and the rest of the free world knows it. The astonishing thing is so many self-described patriots didn't have a fucking clue. (http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/us-election-the-world-reacts/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Poor dumb republicans - sold a bill of goods by Trump</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-11 14:11:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the new Trump administration gels, it is getting obvious that they duped republicans. Trump lies but he also told you all that he lies. When confronted with all his changing positions, he freely admitted he tells people what they want to hear. It's how he has always operated, he bragged about it in his books, and he told you. Republicans bought a pig in a poke. Somehow they thought he wouldn't lie to them. He even pretended for a while that he was a Christian. That really has to burn the religious right that fell for that line of bullshit. All giddy over "locking her up"? Not going to happen. Juiliani and Christie and Trump himself have been walking that back. Keep chanting it though if it makes you feel better, but you were lied to. "Drain the swamp"? Trump is loading his cabinet with Washington insiders and lobbyists. Trump is just dumping more shit in the swamp. But be happy! Trump is planning to rip out "Obamacare" so we can go back to emergency rooms so packed with people with minor issues that those with real emergencies see overworked and exhausted doctors who don't have time to properly care for you - when you finally get seen. Hopefully you aren't one of the people who relies on Obamacare since when it goes away the insurance companies are going to charge you crazy premiums and then cheat you on benefits. Raped at both ends and bet your new insurance excludes coverage for that unfortunate condition. We're pulling out of all climate efforts so have fun with global warming. It was a crucial time as we were just starting to see movement on how much CO2 we are pumping into the atmosphere. The last five years are the hottest on record by huge margins and with Sarah Palin as interior secretary, we will be "drill, baby, drilling" on government wilderness lands. Ahhh the soothing sounds of oil and gas wells in National parks and oil sheens on formerly pristene lakes and rivers! Yay? And the EPA will be going away too. Along with most regulations on big business. Enjoy new chemical dumps leaking into groundwater, no more clean ups (gotta pay for that wall, you know), air pollution, etc. Warm yourself by a burning river or lake. (You young ones may not have been alive when we had dead rivers and lakes actually burn, but we did. Take heart, though, as you stand a great chance of seeing it for yourselves as history repeats!) And a Russian diplomat even confirmed Russia and the Trump campaign have been communicating all along as Russian hackers have worked to influence the election. Meanwhile, Trump has been posturing in ways that are setting the stage for a Russian invasion of NATO countries that had sought our help and protection after finally being able to escape communist rule. A new iron curtain is on its way. Viva communism!? Putin sure enjoyed the Trump win and they popped champagne bottles in the Russian parliament. They really wanted that Trump win. Kind of amazing isn't it? And the Russians are still active on social media big time trying to manage the fallout from the election. And China is loving Trump long time! His total disinterest in China's illegitimate claims in the South China Sea mean China gets that massive gas field that will just speed up global warming. Some fun for your daughters too! Besides a president on tape bragging about invading women's privacy, assaulting women by grabbing them by the breasts and genitals and forcibly kissing them, and being a serial adulterer, bully, and who threatens anyone who dares to tell the truth about him with lawsuits, you also get a First Lady with lots of nude photos and even girl on girl sex scenes. Oh, and the cherry on top is gutting their reproductive rights and ability to decide their parenting future. Better teach them about rape, birth control, and their lack of options. Not even a morning after pill for them. Good luck with that. Seriously. Good luck. This ruins lives. Woo! Woo! Let's get on that Trump train! Our allies are terrified, communism is about to explode all over Eastern Europe, and ripped out regulations mean American consumers are about to get butt fucked like never before. Let's ride this country straight to hell! But hey, he isn't Hillary with a rogue email server. He just had a clandestine communication channel with Russia all this time and is doing everything Putin wants! He's got all the words! http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/10/russian-diplomat-there-were-contacts-with-trumps-campaign.html Sexual predator, con man, thief, adulterer, serially bankrupt, morally bankrupt, liar... Just a really despicable person. Oh and don't forget Trump already has an enemies list! Shades of Richard Nixon... We get all the worst possible scenarios in just one candidate! How proud must republicans be right now! Yay? The next four years will be interesting, indeed. Look, most people don't like Hillary. She and the DNC really pissed off millennials by pushing Bernie out, I think she is corrupt, and she and her ego put her run ahead of the good of the country. She should not have been on the ballot. Obviously she was unelectable even compared to the worst person anyone could imagine. But no way would she in your worst nightmares be as bad as Trump. Everyone who didn't vote in protest or voted for Trump for "change" is going to get what they deserve. Unfortunately, so will the rest of us. I have to admit that it will be interesting but in the same way as a horror or apocalypse movie is interesting. That orange bloviating idiot is going to be Putin's bitch and just might get us into a Third World War. Odds for this are very high. He thinks he knows way more than generals and advisors and Michael Hayden was amazed that he would totally reject all the information he was presented with in his security briefings because he thought interpretations were wrong, etc. Trump, in spite of having no experience, thinks he is way smarter than anyone trying to advise him and any other world leaders he will have to deal with. That is just so fucking dangerous. On the plus side, a Third World War will likely be very short. People wanted "change" and they are going get it in spades. Trump change. Enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn good thing Donald Trump is going to pull the USA out of all climate agreements, eliminate all subsidies for alternative energy, and start drilling in federal lands! Just in time too! We were almost on a course to be able to say in some decades we had stopped increasing our CO2 loading rate in the atmosphere. It was already bad. Exxon knew a long time ago how dangerous fossile fuels were for the climate but hushed it all up. And now they won't get prosecuted for it! Woot! We've been increasing the rate of CO2 generation all this time and thank god we don't have to stop now! We can even get back to increasing that rate like good republicans! The only justice is so far it looks like the areas of the country hit by the largest tornado swarms and flooding are largely the ones that voted Trump into office. Good for them. Come spring at least when they are out wondering why God didn't protect them and instead decimated their houses, towns, and businesses, the world will have another answer for them to consider...

    <TEXT>You are probably going to lose it next January. All the states with legalized recreational pot went to Hillary except Alaska. Medical pot has more red states. But the thing is, there are a lot of conservative voters that republicans need to keep happy at least to some extent as Trump reneges on various campaign promises. What better way than having the DEA and Federal attorneys go back to enforcing the Federal laws? You've now got republicans in all the branches and will very soon have a republican majority on the Supreme Court. Trump passed himself off as a law and order president. Blue states will probably stay blue next election so it's more to republican benefit to piss off people in blue states than red. And besides, he won't be making it illegal. It's been illegal all along. He will just be enforcing the laws already on the books. Maybe - maybe - medical pot will stay available but bet the controls get tighter. I bet it all goes away. No matter how you slice it, odds are that recreational pot is dead and just doesn't know it yet. Medical may be too. So many issues all tied to a Trump presidency. You get Trump change! You get Trump change! And you get Trump change! Sigh...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Donald Trump Unstable and Unfit to be President?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-29 13:44:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lots of people tried to warn Trump supporters that he was unstable and unfit to be president. Many supporters thought Donald Trump would change from his unstable behavior during the campaign and take on the seriousness of the job of being POTUS. It was all a show to get votes and Trump would straighten up if he won the election. Well, not going to happen. Just this morning he is calling for unilaterally overturning a Supreme Court decision on the First Amendment - freedom of speech. If he doesn't like it, it needs to be illegal according to our spray-tan orange, soon to be president. http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/donald-trump-flag-burning-penalty-proposal/index.html  gt;President-elect Donald Trump proposed on Tuesday a penalty -- including possible jail time or loss of citizenship -- for burning the American flag, in spite of two US Supreme Court rulings that protect the act under the First Amendment as a form of free speech.  gt;"Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag -- if they do, there must be consequences -- perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!," Trump tweeted. (Streisand Effect Alert - Expect a lot of flag burning through this idiot's four year debacle.) But wait, there's more! Just like the infomercial scams that advertised "Trump University", you don't just get ripped of once, there's more crap steamrolling into our lives: http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/donald-trump-transition-presidency/index.html  gt;Winning the presidency didn't change Donald Trump -- and it's increasingly clear that actually being president won't change him either.  gt;**Dramas roiling the president-elect's transition process in recent days show him to be the same, mercurial, sometimes thin-skinned, gregarious, truth-challenged, media taunting and unpredictable figure who won a stunning election upset.**  gt;From the outside, the intrigue and internal feuding between competing power factions in the Trump orbit, his explosive tweeting and wrenching changes of political positions suggest a chaotic approach to forming a government. But there's a simple truth that links all the controversies that have gathered around the President-elect in the three weeks since he won the election: Trump is determined to be Trump. God help us.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-12-16 00:32:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>David Gergen has served as an adviser to four U.S. presidents. He is a professor of public service and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. He just ripped Trump for not being presidential and spending his time Tweeting about petty stuff like the Vanity Fair Trump Grill review (hilarious commentary about "flaccid" food) instead of a single Tweet about the humanitarian crises in Aleppo or anywhere else. They also discussed what Richard Branson had to say about a dinner he had with Trump where all Trump would talk about was how he was going to ruin anyone who opposed his businesses. You need to see the show. Erin Burnett's Out Front. On now but will be re-run. Trump is a disaster. God help us. If only the electoral college would do their job and pick a consensus alternative.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-08 14:55:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here is the conversation on Twitter from 3 days ago. Sorry, don't have the direct links since on a tablet but easy to find if you just check vk2zay (Alan Yates) posts: Michael Strickland: @vk2zay @ID_R_McGregor @rpavlik so do we have a limit of tracked devices with SteamVR? I'd assume bandwidth is an issue at some point. Alan Yates: @droiddude228 @ID_R_McGregor @rpavlik still under test, not sure what the limit is yet, but I've seen 10 running in SteamVR on the one PC. Nat Brown: @vk2zay @droiddude228 @ID_R_McGregor @rpavlik current arbitrary limit in hdrs is 16 tracked devices so HMD + 2 wands leaves 13 slots. But that is with a caveat. If you continue on in the conversation, each puck has its own radio link and paired receiver for now. Alan Yates: @rpavlik @joeludwig @ID_R_McGregor I always give the host-side guys crap about arbitrary limits, they have MMUs, no excuses for them. ;) If you read through that conversation they discuss each tracked puck needing its own receiver though Yates says that Nordic (the chipmaker for the radio chip/link) is apparently coming out with more advanced radios that can act like hubs where one dongle can link to multiple pucks. The HMD has two of these radios in it on a USB hub already to be able to communicate with the two wands.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do-It-Yourself Anti-Trump Bumper Stickers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-30 12:28:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>If anyone wants anti-Trump bumper stickers, these designs are ready to go. I've been getting them printed at Vistaprint.com (I have absolutely zero affiliation with them. I've only had good results getting them printed there.) The designs are 3"X11" and are properly sized with the proper bleed. I've been sticking them on sheet magnet material I get from Amazon.com so they aren't actually stuck to my car and I can swap them out as I wish. They are ready to go. Just pop whichever images you want into the design your own bumper sticker dialog. Anyway, it's an easy, fun, and inexpensive way to resist and show others there are those who don't subscribe to his brand of crazy. http://i.imgur.com/3Ij9swI.jpg (Tiny Hands...

    <TITLE>Real World Weather and Hurricane Irma</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-10 15:58:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Been having some new experiences flying with real world weather in Florida. Took off in the 172 from Summerland Key Cove private strip earlier today when the eye was right overhead. Sunny and clear with low winds. I flew west to the Key West Naval Air Station but never made it. In just a few miles the sun disappeared and it started getting darker with rain and wind. Was at 400 AGL flying along the highway and had to turn around when visibility went to zero. Was a bouncy turn too. There was no eye wall. Just a fairly rapid transition from good weather to very bad. Made that flight a few times as I was checking movement but on the last flight after the 180, the skies just went clear and sunny. I checked to see if a weather station went down but I think what was happening was the north side of the hurricane was blanking the Doppler radar from being able to see the south side. Anyway, as Irma moves north, Naples and Tampa are going to provide similar opportunities and maybe even more complete weather. It's very impressive that the detail is as good as it is. I was flying rain bands yesterday and they were there in the sim just like on real life weather radar.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>VR is Better than PCars1 But Still Flawed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-22 18:31:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>After a bit of fumbling with my G27 (Windows buggered it once again), I was able to give some cars a workout. Just a sampling but they were the ones I really wanted to try. VR is better in PCars2 but SMS still isn #8217;t as good as Assetto Corsa in the car appearance category and your own car still isn #8217;t fully rendered. Why SMS? Why? I found the performance settings and car detail, turned it up to ultra, but still, what is behind the driver still is not fully rendered. I tested the Lotus 49 and Jaguar among others, and while the open wheel cars don #8217;t have full on cartoon rear ends as in PCars1, there is a lot of detail missing. The Jaguar E Type has wheel covers of sorts. They don #8217;t even bother. When racing it doesn #8217;t matter. Your attention is focused on the track ahead. But VR isn #8217;t like driving a monitor. We can get out of the cars in the pits, on the start grid, etc, and look around. In VR we see the lack of detail and the mistakes. Sigh. Also, not sure if it happens in monitor driving but I am occasionally getting what looks like a single frame of something from the sim occasionally popping into view when racing. It #8217;s a bit startling and annoying. Something funky is going on with the graphics every so often. But other than that, the cars feel much better. At least that is fixed at least to my preferences. Still a beautiful sim, but I sure wish SMS understood VR better. Not rendering the full car from the driver position is not good. The whole car model is there. You see it in external views and replays. But they still don #8217;t render the whole car for the driver. SMS - We can see the whole car. Give us a toggle to render the whole car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>/u/TopGear11 suggested a setting from PCars1 to fix the weird motion in VR when taking high bank curves like at Monza: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcars/comments/35ht5x/is_there_a_way_to_lock_the_cockpit_view/ It works great. Set World Movement to 100 in the camera settings/movement menu. When TopGear first mentioned it I set the wrong thing - lean - and thought it didn #8217;t work. That #8217;s not the setting. You want World Movement and that fixes it totally. Tried a wreck and the view stays oriented to the car as well. Posting as a regular topic since others have mentioned the issue as well.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s somewhat to music what TiltBrush is to drawing. Tried it out last night and was blown away. You can create your own stylized instruments and play them, record and overdub, change tempo and beat, but the dev has some real innovation in rotating your view when teleporting, selecting controller tools, and menu interactions. I #8217;d like to see more instruments but am still learning the software. There is a board that shows all the beats as the songs progress and maybe there is editing capability there. If not, it would be a nice feature. But it #8217;s really cool to sit back and watch/listen to the demos. Hopefully people will post more compositions. It #8217;s a very cool app. Not really a review. More of a recommendation. It #8217;s not expensive at $15. http://store.steampowered.com/app/606920/EXA_The_Infinite_Instrument/ Edit - found the setup for the ringers. Lots of options! You can make all sorts of instruments yourself.</TEXT>

Don #8217;t take it outside without covering the lenses or putting it in its box. Don #8217;t even set it down where halogen lighting can hit the lenses. Repairs are expensive and take a long time. And any shocks through the ear buds are static shocks which will eventually cause damage and failure. Humidify, use different shoes, etc, to get rid of static buildup.</TEXT>

After that, it will be made available with the updated base stations and controllers early in the second quarter of the year. Assuming this information from Polygon is accurate, I wonder if we will get e-mails with details on how to opt in on the HMD-only offer. That may be when we also get pricing information. (Please note that I am only asking - not saying that e-mail is how we'll opt in. They could also do something like put out a blanket press release that says anyone who wants in send in your serial number or something.) Also the Q2 target on full kits sounds good too. I'm having a hard time waiting. I so want this. ;-)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Facebook is getting a lot of scrutiny these days</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-18 16:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>NBC's Meet the Press this morning (many stations rebroadcast so check your listings) had a segment on Facebook and data harvesting by Cambridge Analytica. Without going into details - which are fascinating on who they are and who their clients are - Facebook allowed a huge amount of personal information on 50 million users to get out. When they told Cambridge to delete the data, Cambridge claimed they had but the evidence says they didn #8217;t. So what #8217;s the point? The panelists were discussing how incompetent Facebook is - either willfully for profit or because of simple incompetence and a willingness to look the other way - for profit. Zuckerberg is getting hauled in front of congress again and once again, the underlying issue is not protecting Facebook's users from data harvesting and misuse. So it #8217;s not just Facebook that people need to worry about. It #8217;s their partners who they let access their data and only slap wrists when caught. People's reactions and attention are easily harvested in VR. Especially with eye tracking, which Oculus Rift users are giddy about, it turns into a gold mine of subconscious metrics which is what Cambridge Analytica was after. And Facebook doesn #8217;t seem to safeguard user data if this weekend's revelations are any guide. Social VR data will be flowing through Facebook servers. Even without eye tracking, but especially with, that data will be in high demand by Facebook and by the people to whom Facebook sells access to user data. People just need to be aware. Do with that information what you will. But if you get a chance, catch the rebroadcast of Meet the Press or see it when it #8217;s available online. The segment is in the last 5-10 minutes. This is how Facebook is perceived by the press and politicals. And this is how you can expect your data to be handled if you give them access to it.</TEXT>

On the plus side, if they survive (probably), their consumer protection and data gathering/sales models will have to change. Zuckerberg stands a good chance of having to step down though nobody has the power to actually force him out. It will be interesting to see how all of this affects Oculus. One positive aspect is Facebook will probably not be able to data mine VR users for behavior data without fully disclosing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oculus users should pay close attention to what the license agreement allows access to. In Facebook world it seems that if there is data they can collect, they do.  gt;If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago #8212;specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) #8212;that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. But Android applications could bypass this change if they were written to earlier versions of the API, so Facebook API could continue to gain access to call and SMS data by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Google deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API in October 2017 #8212;the point at which the latest call metadata in Facebook users' data was found. Apple iOS has never allowed silent access to call data. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/?utm_source=newsletter amp;utm_medium=email amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam amp;stream=top-stories http://thehill.com/policy/technology/380247-facebook-collected-phone-call-text-message-data-report P.S.

    <TITLE>About that USB-C Connection for the Vive Pro</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-30 12:58:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think there has been any real information posted but the Vive Pro page says: Connections: USB-C 3.0, DP 1.2, Bluetooth If you have a Pro on the way, might want to make sure if you have a USB-C port on your computer. They aren #8217;t all that common yet. Adapters look like there could be issues. Wikipedia has a lot of information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C  gt;Legacy adapters with a USB-C receptacle are "not defined or allowed" by the specification because they can create "many invalid and potentially unsafe" cable combinations. There is a reason USB-C has all those contacts and it #8217;s doubtful that HTC would use that connector if they didn #8217;t need those circuits. If your computer doesn #8217;t already have a USB-C port, you might want to get an interface card to be ready. If you try to use an adapter it may not work. I wouldn #8217;t think there would be damage but Wikipedia does say there can be unsafe combinations so hard to say. We'll know more soon but better to be prepared than stuck next Thursday with a new headset and no way to use it. Edit: HTC has a setup guide that also shows the Type A USB 3.0 connector: https://www.vive.com/nz/setup/vive-pro-hmd/ https://www.vive.com/media/filer_public/61/82/618290a9-bfe2-4bfc-97e8-683764f17198/img-setup-link-box-3.png</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First impressions of the Pro</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-05 20:27:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR - I love it! Beautiful displays and extremely comfortable. It #8217;s solid. But as some others have noted, you can still see the screen door though it disappears even faster than it did in Vive 1. I don #8217;t seem to have the same issue with god rays others have mentioned, though. While they are there, they seem much reduced over the 1. Sound is also good. I don #8217;t notice a difference from the DAS, but then my ears aren #8217;t what they used to be. Sounds great as far as I can tell. The mounts for the headphones seem sturdier and are quick and easy to adjust. It also comes with little covers for the mount pockets if you decide to demount them and use speakers or headphones. The balance is great and though I don #8217;t notice a weight difference (don #8217;t have a scale to really tell), on my head it feels lighter. That may be the balance or who knows, but the comfort is definitely there. Clarity is noticeably improved and it #8217;s much easier to see dials and gauges in flight sims. This was what I was looking for most of all and while things are still pixelated, life is so much better in the cockpit. The combination of comfort and improved resolution makes this a worthy upgrade - for me. I don #8217;t regret the purchase at all. So for general use, if the cost makes it a stretch for some, I can #8217;t unequivocally say you need it. It #8217;s definitely nicer but depending on how you feel about $800, it may not be $800 nicer. I #8217;d recommend trying one first if you are on the fence. Maybe you'll be impressed enough or maybe you won't. Edit: I get more and more impressed as I try more apps. The visuals are great! But if you have the money and you are a sim head, I have no problem recommending the Pro. None whatsoever. Yeah, triples are still higher resolution and all that, but for me it #8217;s VR all the way and with the Pro now. It #8217;s not perfect and it #8217;s not retina resolution by any means, and it #8217;s not a huge jump over the 1, but you need to see detail in a cockpit and the Pro lets you do that significantly enough better than the 1 that I am a very happy camper. I think it will be awesome in racing as well though I haven #8217;t tried that. Slightly different reasons, but that #8217;s another application that can certainly benefit from higher resolution. Edit for more: After more time in sim, if the sim isn #8217;t well optimized, frame rates do take a hit. P3D 4.2/FlyInside had the frame rates basically cut in half to where I now need to turn down the eye candy. Looking at my GPU/CPU reporting, the GPU (1080Ti) isn #8217;t working hard at all. Not sure if it #8217;s more or less than before. CPU load on a couple of cores is way up though. So something to be wary of - the Pro can drag down frames and require cutting back on detail/features in some sims. Now to try Aerofly. Will update. Edit for Aerofly: Aerofly FS2 already looked good, but it #8217;s amazing in the Pro. P3D was a significant improvement but Aerofly is kind of amazing because it #8217;s starting to look even more real. If you are into sims, I have to say Aerofly is the experience to judge the Pro by. It just eats the extra resolution and burps unicorns. Before, taxiway markings were a bit more difficult to see but they stand out now. The big red runway number blocks look painted - not that you can see brush strokes, and pulling up to park next to other planes is cool for how solid and real they look. Looking down at an airport or scenery is a treat. Definitely a must try in the Pro. It #8217;s kind of the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (for anyone that remembers them) of VR sims now in the Pro. More - I #8217;m getting more and more impressed by the resolution as I sort out better how to do the settings. I think the people saying it #8217;s not that noticeable might not have strong enough rigs to drive it? I was burying the rig with P3D and the visuals were better than the 1 but not hugely better. Aerofly is better optimized and it was stunning. I tried Summer Funland and it also looked significantly better than the 1. I tried Iron Wolf and it also looks quite a bit better. Immersion is also better and the headphone mounted volume control is extremely handy. All in all very happy with it and getting happier as I see more of the improvements. The Pro kicks it!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>For those upset about the Q2 Pro bundle availability</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-24 12:29:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Many people here are upset that they bought the V1 Lighthouse and wand bundles to go with the Pro. Vive general manager Dan O'Brien told Polygon, and it was posted here multiple times, that the full bundle would be available "early Q2". The article was from an interview when they debuted the Pro at CES: https://www.polygon.com/virtual-reality/2018/1/8/16863124/htc-vive-pro-price-release-date  gt;We #8217;ll get details about the price and final availability in the next few weeks, but the hardware will first be available as an upgrade for existing Vive owners in the first quarter of 2018. After that, it will be made available with the updated base stations and controllers early in the second quarter of the year. It was the Reddit echo chamber and all the naysayers who convinced you guys that the Pro bundle was probably an end of year Christmas item. HTC did tell us the full bundle was coming soon. They offered the Pro headset only to current Vive owners, and told us when the bundle was going to be available. Obviously many here are upset at the pricing but I truly believe they are underestimating the considerations of bringing something like this to market. People spend much more on a gun. I wanted to post the Polygon article link yet again because people are saying some stupid shit about the Q2 bundle release and are upset that they just bought the V1 kit that HTC put together to let people buy the Pro who didn #8217;t already have a Vive and needed the parts. HTC did state their plans and people chose to ignore it while others claimed it was unrealistic to put out the full kit that soon.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA - Setting up the Vive Pro bundle</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-27 17:16:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just set up my Pro bundle and found a few caveats. It #8217;s been a while since I set up the regular Vive so can #8217;t remember if all of it applies to the regular Vive as well. Also, just didn #8217;t hit some of these issues on the OG Vive. I had no firmware updates for the Lighthouses but did for the wands and headset. It #8217;s in the settings menu of SteamVR. They don #8217;t seem to show "!" On the front panel SteamVR icons any more. Lighthouses - they need to have a direct line of sight to the headset to wake up. Took a while to sort that out as I had set the headset down where it couldn #8217;t see one of the Lighthouses and that Lighthouse wouldn #8217;t wake up. Once I moved the headset to where the headset could see it, it woke right up. Also, the software complains if the Lighthouses are farther apart than 5 meters. Need to move one a bit to get it to be happy. Headset - firmware update was trivial. It just worked. Wands - once I saw those needed firmware and told SteamVR to do it, it said to do the two-button start with the wand plugged in via USB cable to the computer. It wouldn #8217;t update. The wands automatically turn off and I was doing the two button start from off. Be sure to turn them on before initiating the firmware update. But it still wouldn #8217;t update. On looking closer at the dialog it said to do the two button press on "this" controller. It was showing a generic wand image but it wanted the other wand and not the one I was holding. As soon as I initiated the update on the other wand it went immediately. Then back to the first one to get it updated. It was a 50:50 chance of starting with the correct one. But it all works great. Lighthouses work great, wands work great, sound is great, and now my wife can play too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I wish Huang would have given more details for VR on the 20 series</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-21 09:29:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Huang's talks left out important information while he concentrated on repeating "giga-rays" and flipping back and forth between RTX on and RTX off. That was important to show off the technology but he said little about how ray tracing can be used for foveated rendering or how including the VirtualLink port enables the next gen VR. I'd bet that for foveated rendering we could see the parallel rendering benefits he was using in his relative performance graphs except it #8217;s entirely new territory. Let the shaders render a full scene at low resolution and then ray trace the foveal region at high resolution. That #8217;s a very small solid angle so the number of pixels to ray trace is very small. Instead of doing just highlights in a full display image, it could mean we effectively see a full scene appearing to be fully ray traced when its really just fully ray traced wherever we happen to be looking at the time. That would be extremely efficient. It makes sense to me that that is how that would work, and would be hugely valuable and efficient, and yet all we got was "RTX can be used for foveated rendering". The stuff about VirtualLink is similar though we at least have resources for that. VirtualLink has really cool features that will kick ass for VR. But people need to go root through the VirtualLink consortium website to see what they are. People over on /r/virtualreality are calling the 20 series a "filler" release when it actually is kind of a significant milestone for VR. The problems are Huang didn #8217;t explain it well - the how and why - and these features won #8217;t get broad play until high res VR headsets with eye tracking hit. Instead, he just left it laying on the floor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EVGA has some very tempting iCX2 2080Ti models listed, and has some 3 fan 2.75 slot designs, but only the lower end non iCX2 models went up for preorder so far. I was just wondering in the past how long it has taken EVGA to flesh out their offerings once a chip came available.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tariffs on Computer Parts Start Monday</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-22 11:49:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Something to consider for buying decisions coming up if you are in the US. A 10% tariff starts on Monday that goes to 25% on January 1. It won #8217;t affect all cards/boards the same as it depends on what was made in China. A lot is made in Taiwan, Malaysia, etc, but it will probably lead to shortages of some components and price increases on others as manufacruring in China gets shifted to other locations, if it gets shifted to other locations, and if the trade war continues. Maybe of most importance right now are cards in transit from China to the US. When they go through customs is when duties are assessed. Since a lot of Ti boards got delayed, they will cost manufacturers 10% more based on the value of the card. Cash up front. January 1 that becomes 25%. If you thought 20 series cards were expensive now, they stand a big chance of becoming significantly more so. This could be why retailers like Amazon and Newegg have been cancelling orders that can #8217;t be fulfilled before the tariffs take effect. That they can #8217;t deliver the cards is their out to break the sales contract. I #8217;ve had other items get delayed that they just say it #8217;s late and I can cancel if I want to. Or, it could be that retailers anticipated the tariffs and that #8217;s already figured in. I kind of doubt this since there was supposed to be a big launch of everything before the tariffs got imposed, and product was to ship before. But that got disrupted by Typhoon Mangkhut as it went right through the big Pacific manufacturing centers in the Phillipines, brushed Taiwan, and was a direct hit on Hong Kong/southern China. Those areas are in various degrees of search, recovery, and cleanup now. This may be part of why nobody wants to give firm delivery dates yet, either. Only Nvidia and board partners know how much they are affected by these things but likely they are affected and by extension, we are too. Anyone thinking of hardware upgrades may want to get orders in or buy from shelves soon if you can because there may be shortages, delays, and price increases rolling through the supply chain. China just called off talks to avert the tariffs 9 hours or so ago. This is about to hit and hit big. Also: https://google.org/crisismap/google.com/2018-mangkhut</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-11 23:51:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s here and up and running. And it is beautiful. It makes my EVGA 1080Ti look like a toy, too. Some minor sag but I got a brace to hold it up square. Just installed driver 416.16 and I swear my desktop looks even more crisp. It #8217;s not clear from the photos, but the bracket is gunmetal gray and very stylish though it #8217;s all buried now and you can #8217;t see it at all. The shroud has such a gloss finish it looks wet. The people unhappy with the looks need to see one in person. It #8217;s gorgeous. Running benches before clocking up but Time Spy and Night Raid are smooth as silk and the numbers are significantly higher than my 1080Ti. I can #8217;t compare results online since it says graphics card not recognized. But this is also stock clocks. Just installed, updated the driver, and started playing. But without comparisons, the results are pretty meaningless. It looks good so far though. Highest temperature so far is 58C. I #8217;m running fans at 100% and sound level isn #8217;t far off from my 1080Ti. Lots more testing to do but those who are getting one are in for a treat. If I had it to do again, I would in a heartbeat.

    <TITLE>Primary vs Secondary BIOS on 2080 Ti FTW3 Ultra</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-16 01:01:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>/u/EVGA_Jacobf just mentioned on the EVGA board that the *secondary* BIOS on the 2080Ti FTW3 Ultra has the higher power limit: https://forums.evga.com/m/tm.aspx?m=2863188 amp;fp=1 amp;p=61  gt;Secondary BIOS goes to 130%, but keep in mind this 130% is much higher than 130% on the standard card. Apparently the primary BIOS only goes to 124%. Just FYI. I would assume switching to secondary and scanning/running that BIOS is covered under warranty? What other differences are there between the primary and secondary BIOS?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Single-Pass Rendering for VR</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-19 04:04:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know I #8217;m late to the party. I was running FlyInside because some of its features are still the best. Vive Pro, SteamVR. But I finally decided to go native VR in P3D and was doing various things, playing with settings, etc, to try to get my frame times below the magic 11 ms. The real answer was staring at me but I didn #8217;t realize it since I was new to native VR in P3D - single-pass rendering. You can do it with 10 and 20 series cards and whatever your frame times are in standard stereo mode, single-pass rendering almost cuts them in half. It #8217;s such a big improvement it's a little hard to even believe it, but it is real. I could turn detail way up and it #8217;s still below 11 ms and butter smooth. Much better visuals and I'm out of reprojection. Nice! I #8217;m sure most already know about it, but if anyone doesn #8217;t, like I didn #8217;t, I wanted to let them know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A TFT LCD might be less susceptible to sun damage than OLEDs but the lenses will still focus the sun down to a pinhead and you can probably kill your headset just like we could with all the OLED display headsets. Always be careful and never let sunlight hit your lenses. Be especially careful setting it down near windows. A careless moment can ruin your headset.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Need to get hold of an Index to know interior dimensions of that port, but even if we need to have boards overlap outside the recess, it is looking very easy... https://www.e-consystems.com/3D-USB-stereo-camera.asp https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-realsense-review/ (Includes depth sensing - unknown if it might interfere with the other Index cameras or other Lighthouse-based headsets or controls in its field of view) https://duo3d.com/ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14725 (Like the Intel RealSense it uses IR illumination for depth) And there are others as well. But it looks like AR or mixed reality will be easy to add to Index if there isn #8217;t already an accessory on the way that uses that front port. Index may be a tinkerer's dream. Less than 6 days to find out now, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read the RoadToVR article and watched the Tested video, and agree - definitely miss the eye tracking. And was hoping for higher resolution screens instead of the same base resolution as Pro/Odyssey. But few things would support eye tracking and higher resolution screens would be that much harder/demanding to render. And apparently an increase in god rays. Luckily I mostly do VR with scenes where I don #8217;t see any god rays now. Also not a fan of the pass-through cameras being that far offset to make room for the "frunk", and apparently, like Vive Pro, not that high of resolution according to Norm though he didn #8217;t specify the resolution or how wide wide-angle is. But nothing much supports the cameras for now, anyway. And no on-board volume control. Sigh. But the higher refresh rates are just a resolution increase in the time domain which reviews are noting really increases the feeling of presence. Presence is the whole point of VR. The effective resolution increase over Vive Pro by going from Pentile OLED to RGB LCD, combined with the field of view increase through optics, better using the pixels you have, and canting the displays out a tad, ought to better, if not match, Vive Pro resolution while contributing to presence as well. For flying and driving sims the field of view will really up the situational awareness and feelings of speed. Combine that with the increase in presence from the refresh rate (on systems powerful enough to drive it) and I can overlook the other stuff. But the headset should have had a volume control. And if the main purpose of the pass-through cameras is vision, then they should have been placed closer to where people #8217;s eyes are located. Move the frunk down since it #8217;s just for makers and has no real intended purpose at this time anyway, or put the camera connector in there too and sell the first module for it - a set of stereo cameras for pass-through video. But it sounds like there is plenty of good in this package. HTC's pricing on the OG and Pro headsets caused lots of grief, but now that Valve is also pricing a top headset at top tier, hopefully people will understand there are real costs involved in making these things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been looking into it and it should be fairly easy to use an Arduino to send keyboard commands back to the host computer over the USB port in the frunk. Just need to use one with a micro that supports USB natively to make it easy. Then can use buttons, a dial, or even capacitive touch to increment/decrement volume just like many USB keyboards do. The same micro can also do the Cylon eye animation. It may be an easy way to circumvent no built-in volume control and add some fun.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA For New VR Folks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-02 13:27:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are a few things you really need to know to avoid damage to the headset, controllers, other things, and yourself. The lenses concentrate light like a magnifying glass. Not sure how resistant the LCD panels are to burning, but way too many people have ruined their displays in other headsets by letting sunlight hit the lenses. Never leave your headsets where sun can hit the lenses and be mindful that the sun angle changes through the day. Shade one hour can be bright sun the next. The lenses are delicate, can be scratched, and are difficult to fix or get replaced. Get lens protectors. You can clean glass much easier than the lens plastic. Be careful with glasses. You can get prescription lens protectors to not need them but if you share the headset, that can be an issue. Others won #8217;t appreciate how delicate the lenses are so don #8217;t be shy about helping people put on or take off the headset, etc. Use proper cleaning materials and be very wary of "cleaning cloths". If those pick up dust you can grind swirl marks into the lenses. Personally, I use flat glass lens protectors and clean using disposable single-use Zeiss pre-wetted lens wipes. VR isn #8217;t like other gaming. You get lost in it. It can be dangerous if you don #8217;t properly prepare your play space. One guy fell through a glass coffee table, got cut bad, and bled to death. Make sure your space is clear of such hazards, properly set up Chaperone, and coach anyone you show it to that they can always just close their eyes. Be aware if you have ceiling fans, low lights, etc. in your play space. You can be flailing around pretty wildly at times and break all sorts of things if you aren #8217;t careful. Be thoughtful of the experiences you try. This was a while ago, but one guy was in a VR haunted house and started having chest pains. He was going into a heart attack. Your mind and body can react to virtual threats as if they were real. Your brain is very susceptible to the imagery it gets when in VR. It #8217;s the thrill but also the danger. Others will laugh, but I don #8217;t ever do first person shooters. Too violent for me. Every person is different. Don #8217;t be like the idiots in some popular videos and subject people to jump scares unless everyone agrees on that and knows what is coming. People can take off running in the virtual world and not realize in the real world they are running at TVs, glass doors, picture windows, walls, stairwells, etc. That disconnect between real and virtual is big. Realize that you are VR ambassadors. You want people to have good experiences - not have fun at their expense and possibly get people hurt, your headset broken, etc. Your headset is a precision bit of kit. It and the controllers can be damaged by smashing them into things. And enjoy. There are whole new worlds out there you'll get to see. Things you #8217;ve never seen before. It #8217;s extremely cool and Index sounds like it will be even more immersive than headsets before it.</TEXT>

If you have cool ambient air and aggressive fan curves, water cooling won #8217;t do a thing for performance. What water generally does do is allow higher overclocks before thermal throttling or other thermal-related issues get in the way provided your overclock is limited by thermals. For my card, the GPU itself limits the overclock and air is fine for its loading. Water would only add expense and complexity for my GPU. YMMV.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nominal resolution is the same between Pro and Index. The biggest thing for adequate performance with Index are the additional frame rates available. The headset can be run at lower frame rates for smoother experiences when the computer isn #8217;t strong enough for the higher speeds. Case venting and if water cooling is needed really depends on too many things to make those blanket statements. There probably are too many who end up heat throttling though but just a bit of airflow management and fan settings can clear up most or all of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I understand what you are asking, the shipping dates shown on the order page are moving targets that change as people sign up for reservations. The longer you wait to reserve, the longer you wait to get your item. Possibly not so long or possibly very long. The reservations aren #8217;t orders. You are just lining up to be able to buy when there is stock for you. As interest grows and more sign up for reservations, delivery dates can be pushed way out. If the page says September 30 now, if that works for you, you should reserve now. Wait until into July and anticipated deliveries may be into October. Or it may not. It all depends on demand. Reservations aren #8217;t an obligation. You don #8217;t pay anything until they have an item for you.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s impossible to directly blame global warming for your delays, but it does make extreme heat more likely and more frequent. Same for storms and floods. Here in the US we got lucky with a week of relative calm but just last week it was tornadoes and flooding all over the central part of the country that also probably would have delayed shipments. The fact is you guys are unseasonably warm and it #8217;s enough to trigger restrictions to mitigate how severe the heat goes. And people will likely die. Can #8217;t say it #8217;s directly and absolutely due to global warming, but the reality is that it probably is. And we #8217;ll just be seeing more of this.</TEXT>

All the comments about colors, black levels, etc, are subject to change tomorrow and Valve did ask reviewers to hold off on full reviews until the new firmware. Whatever changes with that firmware update sounds like it probably will have to do with the displays in addition to whatever else they fix/optimize or why else hold off the full in-depth reviews. We won #8217;t get an authoritative answer on headset quality/experience until that dust settles. Reviews so far are good but comments are being made about black levels not being so black and colors not being as vibrant. It probably won #8217;t get perfect, but I bet it gets better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This kind of thing is happening more and more. Package delivery services pay their drivers crap and they are unmotivated to deliver packages. On my route the drivers love to mark packages refused and just return them to the depot to get shipped back to the vendor. Neighbors get the same thing. We complain to FedEx. They know they have a problem here. But it #8217;s some subcontractor and nothing changes. You would think on-time proper delivery would be a priority to a delivery company but apparently it #8217;s just where the lines cross and they start losing money. FedEx has a bad name here. USPS just slightly better. UPS is still good here for now. Other places will have other ordering. It just sucks.

    <TEXT>Even if SteamVR recommends a firmware update, everything should work without it. I don #8217;t have my rig yet to swear that #8217;s true but it has been true with Vive. Before doing firmware updates, see if everything works. If it does and a firmware update sends it south, that #8217;s almost always recoverable without sending in your stuff for "repair". If stuff doesn #8217;t work before an update, and doesn #8217;t work after, that is an indication at least that it may be the hardware. Either way, you #8217;ll have better answers when you talk with support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the info but since you specifically ask the question, I honestly see no reason to think Valve should limit an adjustment like that. There is a physical person to person variation that could easily make it where others don't see what you see, but also, just don't go that far with the adjustment if it affects your peripheral vision like that and it bugs you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It always needs base stations. I do both sitting and standing in my area. You need some minimum number of sensors on the headset to be able to see the base station sweeps to get tracking. The displays will go gray if not enough. Just arrange your bases so you get good tracking. Worst case is you are facing a wall for sitting and you just don #8217;t get good tracking. You can get a third base and put it right in front of you if you need to. But where you want to sit needs to have good coverage from at least one base.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-29 02:26:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Very first impressions but so far extremely impressed. I was 1st wave DK2, 2nd wave Vive, and 1st wave Vive Pro before putting the Index on, for whatever that's worth. The view is great. It's not a huge FoV increase for me but it's still there and you notice it. There is just a different feeling to it. It's very nice. The clarity across the lenses is amazing. Sharp focus almost to the edge. It really is like cleaning your lenses. To my eyes, I don't really see that the images are dimmer, but I've not had the chance yet to do much that might really drive that home so incomplete for now. I'll add that in later. Colors look fine to me. Maybe it's like fine audio. But for me, so far the feeling is very much like Vive Pro on colors. Again, after I've had time with it I can say more. No dead or stuck pixels. There were a couple of SteamVR updates that said they address the headset disconnected messages/issues and I let the last one update before I powered the headset up. As an aside, I put the Index Display Port connector in the same socket on my video card that the Pro came out of, and did the same with the USB cable - the socket is a blue USB 3 port. Everything came up beautifully and the firmware updates - headset and controllers - all went beautifully. No issues. @Valve - your SteamVR onscreen directions say to use a micro USB cable for the controller updates when those are USB C. Someone was asking about cable diameter. I get 6.43 mm with what feels like good contact but no/little squish. I get 5.73 mm on the Vive Pro headset cable. Mitutoyo digital calipers. The Index cable is definitely thicker and feels slightly stiffer than the Pro cable. The headset is definitely a different feel than the Pro. It is comfortable but it hits different pressure points on me and the face cushion feels slightly firmer than the stock Pro cushion. I do like the thicker top strap and the mechanism to adjust fit. I'll add more as more comes up but all in all, very pleased. As many others have said, it's a lot of small things that add up to just a very quality headset. Edit for more: The sound is phenomenal. It can be uncomfortably loud if you want it to. If feels as loud as the Pro. The sound quality, though, is what gets you. It's expansive and like sitting in a theater with a fancy sound system. It blew me away. No pressure on the ears is also weird. I feel like I'm forgetting something - headphones - but I'm not. This is going to make ambient sound much more important in games/sims. You hear everything. Hard to describe. I brought up The Blu to check out colors, dark level, etc. In Luminous Abyss you can really see the gray from the backlight. This is going to be hard on the folks who like to do things that are very dark. It got much less noticeable as all the luminous fish and jellyfish started coming around but your eyes dark adapt and the gray shows. Whale Encounter had really good blacks but it is a lighter scene. You can still see gray if you look in the dark places but overall it's not noticeable at all to me without looking for it. What starts becoming noticeable are the textures. Index is now good enough to start showing the lower resolution stuff as lower resolution. Just ever so slightly. I think most of it is the better focus but also the extra subpixels. Maybe also the fast backlight timing. There is definitely an upgrade to resolution, or at least the feeling of resolution, over the Pro and it's over most of the field of view. I did Reef Migration to test out colors. All of this was after the latest firmware update so can't address earlier reports of muted colors, but the fish were bright and colorful. Big time. And thanks to the clarity across the FoV, I was seeing things I had never seen before. Stuff just catches your eye now. And brightness was also fine. To really test the brightness, I loaded up DCS and checked that out. Broad daylight is slightly less bright than it is in the Pro but the Pro could also make my eyes strain a little because it was so bright. But the brightness for me is more than fine. Daylight looks like daylight. And DCS also really shows off the fast backlight. Damn things look good and it's easy to see so much more. Again, all the stuff added together is what does it I think - better focus, faster backlight, more subpixels. It's beautiful. And one last bit is my eyes feel different in the Index. I am not sure but I think the virtual images are at a different distance from your eye in the Index than they are in the Pro. That will take some getting used to. The controllers will also take getting used to. I think it's a skill thing too. Giving them what they want. I like the controllers and watching the fingers respond in the hand demo is very cool, but I can also see myself using the wands still depending on the application. After a bit more time I'm definitely glad I got an Index. It's got some differences to get used to and still sorting the fit and positioning, but it's a definite upgrade from the Pro for me. Zombie hunters and those that do a lot of dark stuff may not like the black levels, though. But this is all with stock settings. Maybe Valve has some other update to help black levels coming. Hope so. Improved blacks would pretty much make the Index a perfect headset at this tier. One last thing - someone said a while back that the breakaway connector between the pigtail and headset cable was a magnetic hold. It #8217;s purely friction on my Index. But it can still be a breakaway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. All I can say is my install went flawless. Did the firmware updates and started just being amazed. No problems at all. Not one. A lot of the issues people are reporting sound like computer issues. Either software or hardware. I try to run as lean of a gaming system as I can. Some people use all sorts of helper apps and watchers for social media or whatever. Anyone who has a prebuilt computer probably has a crap ton of bloatware and even what most would call spyware. It all robs cycles and adds complexity and chances for "bugs". There #8217;s just a rush by everyone to get first light and many probably don #8217;t know much technical to even chase down and remove the crapware. It #8217;s expensive and a pain, but one of the best things people could do would be to buy a clean copy of Windows and install and run that instead of the load they got from whatever company built their PC. Windows gets bastardized by resellers and loaded with shit that gets in the way. I #8217;d bet this is a big contributor to people #8217;s software issues. Not suggesting everyone run out and buy Windows, reformat, and reinstall. It really depends on the problems/symptoms.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-29 18:35:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been showing 45 Hz in DCS with Ctl/PrintScreen/PauseBreak with the Vive Pro which I assume just reprojects to 90. Flying past things or other planes buzzing you would let you see the discrete images to some extent and looks a little wonky, but you get used to it. I just tried 120 Hz in the Index. Much nicer. There can still be double images of fast objects, but they are significantly closer together and overlap much more. It really looks nice! Showing FPS in DCS shows 60. So, more of a good thing - 144 Hz. My system can't do it. The FPS counter was sill holding around 60 but much more variable and would dip down. The display looked qualitatively different. Softer. Looks like I'm under the 72 Hz needed for 144 display. I switched back to 120 Hz mode and it looks nice! Going to experiment with other apps and see what 144 looks like. But very nice and noticeable upgrade to the visuals in DCS by going to 120 Hz mode. Guaranteed it will be as noticeable in driving sims too. Maybe more so since stuff is always going by fast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m coming from Vive Pro and Index is definitely worth it to me. Going to 120 Hz really helps a lot in driving and flying sims. Much smoother since 90 Hz is really 45 in sim and 120 is really 60 in sim. So I get 33% faster frames. It #8217;s huge and a big qualitative change. It #8217;s noticeable even just looking around in the SteamVR home scene. It makes a bigger difference than I woul have guessed. Image clarity over the Pro is amazing in its own right. The lens system on Index gives sharp images across the field of view and the 50% more subpixels renders colors and especially white without the graininess you get with pentile OLED. Vive Pro is the same nominal resolution but the subpixels make a big difference. The sharp focus across a scene is huge too. I #8217;m seeing things and details I simply couldn #8217;t before. The only downside I #8217;ve found are the black levels not really being black which is apparent in very dim scenes. In twilight level scenes and brighter, blacks are fine. I can see black levels being important for those that play mostly in very dark or night scenes, but for most applications, you can #8217;t tell because your eyes aren #8217;t so dark adapted. I loved my Pro and have a lot of hours on it, but the Index wins. And the sound is amazing. Its like sitting in a very fancy theater with a high zoot sound system. It #8217;s better than headphones and you hear everything - except low level background sounds in your real environment. I #8217;ve got cooling fans I could always hear in the Pro headphones. Can #8217;t hear them in the Index. I would have guessed it would be exactly the opposite but it #8217;s not even with the ear speakers being open like they are. And outside the headset, they are barely louder than the Pro headphones. The Index audio is going to make soundtracks and foley work much more important. You hear everything. The feeling of ambiance is amazing. The Pro is a good headset. And those who chase zombies in the dark might like the black levels of OLED better. Luckily what I run is medium to brightly lit and it #8217;s gorgeous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But only for me. Others need to make their own decisions, obviously. The black levels are a real thing. If you run The Blu and have the full version, the blacks being gray is fairly distracting in Luminous Abyss. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Whale Encounter is light enough that black levels don #8217;t cause an issue. It looks gorgeous. Reef Migration is jaw dropping. The colors pop and the detail on the fish, rays, and turtle is gorgeous. That gives an idea where the black levels start becoming an issue. There is another issue with Index, though and you can see it in The Blu. They seem to have really optimized the texture detail so it coukd display as fast/smooth as possible. Index has the detail to just begin to show the limitations of the textures. It #8217;s there if you look for it but not bad at all. But I couldn #8217;t tell this in the Pro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Pro is really good. It #8217;s a very worthy headset. But in a nutshell, there are two aspects of the displays used that probably drive the decision. I #8217;m not impressed with the blacks on Index. It #8217;s an LCD. If someone plays stuff that is generally dark and your eyes can dark adapt, you #8217;ll see the backlight. It #8217;s uniform but it #8217;s light enough to stand out. Pro has OLED with much blacker blacks. Totally not an issue in scenes that aren #8217;t pitch black, but it is a noticeable difference. The other is Pentile OLED vs. RGB LCD and a fast backlight and higher frame rates. There #8217;s 50% more subpixels in the LCD. Same nominal resolution, same work for the computer, but to get a white pixel with a Pentile OLED takes two pixels - a green/red and a green/blue. With the LCD it #8217;s just a single pixel. The fast backlight minimizes smear. Things look sharp. And the higher frame rates minimize motion ghosting. Not eliminated, but the motion is smoother. The upshot is if you want to do things where detail and fast relative motions are important, and what you do is mostly better lit, maybe the Index. If you want to do things where true darks/blacks are important and maximum resolution may not be and a little "motion blur" is ok, maybe the Vive Pro. On the full kits, between Index controllers and Vive wands, they are obviously very different. They each kind of fit better for different applications. I #8217;m still getting used to the Index controllers. There #8217;s obviously many more possible interactions and you need to learn how to use them. But seeing your fingers in VR is pretty damn cool. The Vive wands don #8217;t do fingers, but that may not be so bad in many applications, and even a bonus in others. You just pick up a wand but you have to put on the Index controllers. Again, personal preference. But both are good. I think the pros and cons of them, since they are also different, should be considered against what kinds of apps interest you.</TEXT>

I actually get more tiny hesitations and slightly blurrier display images at 144 than I do at 120 which is reprojected 60. I would bet the experience will be similar with PCars2. Give it a try and see how things are on your system. 120 Hz might be smoother. But is it ever gorgeous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been running at 45 reprojected to 90 in the sims I run with the Vive Pro. Very workable but any big relative motions and you can sometimes see multiple images. Just the nature of the beast. 60 reprojected to 120 is immediately noticeably nicer. I think it #8217;s partly the faster base frame rate, but also the fast and sharp backlight pulsing. Both make everything just look more crisp. It #8217;s a hard thing to describe but you know it when you see it. My system can #8217;t do 72 native in the sims I run at the settings I run so 144 is wasted on me now. But I won #8217;t be going back to 45/90 as long as I can hold 60.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I do - mostly simulation - is hard to even hit the native frame rates so it #8217;s always in reprojection. That said, I can #8217;t even hit 72 Hz to reproject up to 144. If I select 144 Hz, the view starts to have jitters/stutters and frame rate bounces around 60 with lots of variation and the images go "soft". If I set to 120 Hz, I get a solid 60 reprojected to 120, everything is sharp, and motion really smooths out. That #8217;s the sweet spot for me. 144 is out. I think people need to experiment on their system with the applications they run to see what their sweet spot is. If your system can #8217;t keep up, you still see a pretty good image but it #8217;s significantly worse than a slower display rate where your system can keep up.</TEXT>

I don #8217;t do dimly-lit near total dark scenes so black levels are also fine by me. But I can see why others could be dissatisfied. Those can be important - very important - to some. People had to buy Index on faith. Valve kept a lid on reviews until even after some buyers were getting theirs. It #8217;s high end tech that you wear but only very few got to try it early and they were essentially barred from providing important details. That is the problem. People bought who might not have had they been given a heads-up and the ability to make an informed decision. Let reviewers review the product. Let the reviews go public before you start preorders. Valve sat on inventory so everything could happen at once. If it was a perfect headset, that would have been fine. But instead, Valve asked people to trust it was a perfect headset and it wasn #8217;t. There #8217;s the rub. Again, I #8217;m very happy with my headset but I understand being unhappy. There #8217;s no way headsets can be perfect. Rift S is pegged at 80 Hz and has unreliable tracking. Index has solid tracking but the controllers are missing a function and black levels suck. People need to be able to make informed decisions on expensive hardware that is so personal. It #8217;s not fair to buyers to keep them in the dark and surprise them with something as fundamental as poor black levels. Those complaining about a tether? That #8217;s on them. We all knew that it had a tether.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Much more often and actually all the time in the stuff I run. I came from DK2/Vive Pro/Vive so I #8217;ve only run OLED until now. The new 60/120 Hz frame rate is sooo much smoother than 45/90 (33% and in what I do very noticeable), the higher resolution especially on white makes dash text much easier to read, and the colors are beautiful. To my eyes, the colors are stunningly realistic. In Aerofly FS2, everything looks way past the uncanny divide and looks real. In anything that isn #8217;t dimly to darkly lit, blacks are excellent. I don #8217;t do the extremely dark stuff so black levels look great. But one test I did was to check out the three scenes of The Blu. For those familiar with it, the Reef Migration colors are stunning. They pop more. In Whale Encounter, you can just barely start to notice the blacks aren #8217;t completely black but you are having to look specifically for that to notice it. But Luminous Abyss is a problem at least for me. Your eyes dark adapt and then you can easily see the gray. I #8217;d even wonder if devs may have to rethink lighting so their stuff plays well on LCD and eyes don #8217;t dark adapt so well. So I definitely see black levels being an issue for some. If all I ran was The Blu's Luminous Abyss, I #8217;d not want an Index. But that #8217;s a meditation/relax/demo application so not a big deal. I #8217;ll just zone to Reef Migration. The stuff I run is fine in the Index. More than fine. No way I #8217;m going back. It #8217;s a very nice step up from the Pro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s now the stuff of legend. There was apparently a way that a color profile file of some kind was missing in SteamVR in some installs. People who had that file missing got a washed-out display. As soon as people had Steam verify SteamVR file integrity it would spot the missing file and drop it in. After that, their colors went to popping. It was a missing file but Valve might want SteamVR To check for critical files like that. Until then, anyone with washed-out colors should know that #8217;s not a hardware defect and is just SteamVR missing a file.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You make excellent points. Nobody had to buy anything. And hopefully in the future, people will keep how this went in mind and maybe not preorder if they don't feel they know enough to make an informed choice. Not human nature, though. I had a good idea what Index was going to be like and there were reviews that discussed that, but they were also contradictory. For example, Norm wasn't particularly clear in how he discussed black levels. Some said black levels were great. Some said there was light leakage. It could be we just have reviewers who don't understand this stuff get their reviews promoted in various ways so misinformation wins. There is a bigger societal lesson here too. Or maybe, the industry publishes hard core metrics that people can use to compare things but Valve wasn't especially forthcoming their either. But it still is a consumer choice. They do not have to buy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use reprojection and can #8217;t use motion smoothing. Mostly I do flight sims and motion smoothing introduces pretty bad artifacts behind wing leading edges and propellers. As an aside, ASW on the Oculus platform does the same thing. The difference in frame rates is very noticeable to me. For things with small relative motion - walking in a dungeon or whatever - you #8217;d never notice a difference. But have an airplane buzz you, or fly by things on the ground and you get double images instead of smooth motion as it goes by. Upping from 45 to 60 really reduces that. It #8217;s not totally gone but more of it is gone and not as many scenarios cause it. So things just feel smoother. I know others sense/feel the same thing with smoother and sharper. It #8217;s a fairly universal comment by reviewers but I imagine that is also convoluted with the effect of a fast-flashing backlight, maybe the way things meant to look realistic, look realistic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know if Valve has a software on/off switch available in the Index but there isn #8217;t a physical on/off switch. That #8217;s a shame because there are a number of us who get the notice that the headset is disconnected whenever we power up our systems. That error message is a bug, or there is a hardware bug, or something, but the fix is to either disconnect and reconnect the big connector to the trident, or cycle power by unplugging/plugging the power connector on the trident from/to the wall wart power connector (much easier). Still deciding if I want to get an inline power switch or wait for a fix to whatever is causing the headset to not get properly detected when starting SteamVR. Lots of inline power switches on Amazon. There is some debate about keeping it warm through self-heating helping with fogging vs. jumping into an already-warm headset when it #8217;s hot enough to sweat, and also the wasted power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But he makes a good point. The higher frame rates super fast backlight / OLED flash might not be available on OLED. I don #8217;t know current state of the OLED art but after getting higher frame rates and the fast backlight, I choose those over the darker blacks. The blacks look fine until your eyes dark adapt in very dark spaces. Most apps won #8217;t have a problem with black levels but some will. I think Index has highlighted two different VR application areas - dark apps which may be better suited to OLED, and fast apps with lots of motion that may be better suited to LCD and fast backlighting. And it #8217;s a moving target. Hopefully we eventually get really fast OLEDs to get both worlds in one headset.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OLEDs don #8217;t have backlights, though. They are the backlight. And manufacturers have to manage costs so if those options are too expensive, they might as well not be available at all.

    <TEXT>Got Pro day one, had Vive before that, and DK2 before Vive. Index was a big improvement. Like Forrest said, audio. It #8217;s like I forgot something because nothing touches my ears but the sound is all around me. It #8217;s like night and day. The higher frame rates are very welcome too. Makes a big difference. I can #8217;t hit 144 but 120 is beautiful. But if you like very dark games/apps you want to look into Index black levels. If you are in a scene where your eyes dark adapt, there is no missing the gray. In anything with brighter scenes the black levels are fine. My controllers also have the joystick click issue but nothing I run even uses them like that so no big deal for me. Otherwise, the controllers just take some getting used to to get the fingers to work properly. You train them. They train you.</TEXT>

What remains to be seen is how much airflow and ventilation you get like this, but I see no reason it wouldn #8217;t be better than stock because that perforated front piece is now out of the way.

    <TEXT>You need to be accurate. There is screen door effect in the Index but it #8217;s very minor. I can see it but like the headsets that preceded it, you get lost in the experience and don #8217;t notice it. But it is there, very fine. But I think more important are the RGB pixels. Detail is clearer. The increase in effective resolution over pentile OLED is wonderful. The fast flash backlight is amazing too. It #8217;s very noticeable the moment you put the headset on. Everything is just clearer, sharper, and looks better. Black levels may be an issue for those who do the dark lighting things. If your eyes dark adapt, you will probably be able to see the blacks as grays. I decided to keep my Vive Pro on a different computer for things that are very dark. I use the Index mostly and it #8217;s great for the stuff I do the most of. But the stuff my wife does looks best in the Pro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. That #8217;s the thing. If a scene isn #8217;t totally dark then your eyes don #8217;t dark adapt fully and blacks look fine. But if a scene is very dark, and your eyes do adapt, then you see the grays. I got a software update the other day that was specifically to address dark scenes and keep eyes from fully dark adapting. Devs are keeping black levels more in mind and it #8217;s just how they compose the scene and light it. Easy now that they are aware of the issue. It #8217;s a subset of applications and scenes in applications where this can be an issue. Posts like OPs actually do a disservice because some will see gray scenes, get upset, and think they were misled. The Blu's Luminous Abyss in particular shows the black level issue pretty strongly while the other two experiences look fantastic. And it #8217;s all scene lighting that does it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We can #8217;t make a good decision for you. You don #8217;t give enough information. They are both good headsets with their own pros and cons. Index is higher effective resolution since its RGB LCD while Vive is pentile OLED. Index has a slightly larger FoV. They fit a bit different and have other differences like the audio - I love Index's off ear speakers/headphones. I love them both but prefer Index. YMMV. You should look into similarities and differences and see what would work better for what you do or want to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Black levels can be an issue for some but devs seem to be designing scenes now to include something brighter so you don #8217;t notice the blacks as much. But still an issue that you don #8217;t see near as much with OLEDs though they don #8217;t go completely black either to prevent smear. But for racers and pilots or those doing things that are slightly lighter won #8217;t notice it. But Luminous Abyss in The Blu definitely shows off the lack of true blacks in the Index. That would be fantastic in the Index if it weren #8217;t for the gray "blacks".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>30 series cards rumored for this summer may give some price relief on 10 and 20 series cards but time will tell. You can tune much better now but nothing beats horsepower and Index loves horsepower. It really depends on what you like to do in VR. Some applications are much more demanding than others. If you go Index, depending on what you like to do, you may need more computer to run it well or you could be ok with some tuning. The application side is as important to performance as the hardware side and may be why you see some saying it works fine and others saying it doesn #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It can be blocked in most routers and certainly in the OS. Just add a line to the hosts file like: 127.0.0.1 accounts.nvgs.nvidia.cn What that does is short circuit any DNS requests when a program wants to talk to accounts.nvgs.nvidia.cn. The OS consults the hosts file to see if a URL is in there. If it is, it uses that IP address. If not, the OS sends a request out to the network to get an IP address. It then uses that IP address to talk to the web site. The [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) is  #8220;home #8221; - the computer itself. When the program gets that address and tries to talk to the web site, it talks to the local computer itself and not to the actual web site in question. There probably won #8217;t be anything listening at [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) so the request dies. How the program doing the asking handles not getting a response depends on the program. It may lock, wait until timeout, or just keep on trucking. So you may break the program by dropping the requests on the floor. Apparently this is the case by OP #8217;s post. A lot of programs may have a backup plan, though, and use a hard-coded IP address to get what it needs. In that case you may have to monitor packets or do something else to stop all phone home communications. My fave there is pi-hole.net.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RigExpert AA-30.zero working on Raspberry Pi 4 with AntScope2</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-30 13:12:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>It took a some trial and error but I got it working. Most issues were simply that mine arrived with 1.8 firmware and AntScope2 apparently wants 2.0 firmware. For some unknown reason, the RigExpert Windows firmware updater wasn #8217;t working on my install of Windows X. Luckily there is an Apple version of the updater and I got it to work on a Mac. RigExpert also advises not updating firmware with an Arduino used as the USB/serial interface. I grabbed a cheap FTDI 232R USB/serial (switch-selectable voltage on the serial side - you want 5V) and that worked great. Other stumbling blocks is RigExpert gives a wrong command to add a key for a Raspberry Pi repository ([Twolife.be](https://Twolife.be)). The installation instructions for AntScope2 are here: [https://rigexpert.com/antscope2-for-rasberry-pi-raspbian/](https://rigexpert.com/antscope2-for-rasberry-pi-raspbian/) but the [twolife.be](https://twolife.be) site ([https://twolife.be/raspbian/](https://twolife.be/raspbian/)) has the full and proper command (sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E07B3CCBE73CD8EA6B65DA36CF13C21D2578B775). I still have an error message when I click on the Settings button that I #8217;m trying to sort out, but the software itself works great and the Raspberry Pi 4 is a great platform for my radio applications. The Zero is very inexpensive but makes it trivial to tune up an antenna. The antenna in the screen grab is a QRP Guys end-fed half wave set for 10m with the antenna element left a little long to allow trimming to best SWR. It #8217;s resonant down around 24MHz but as I trim it, I can now watch in real time as it moves the dip up to where it should be. Very impressed with the [AA-30.zero](https://AA-30.zero).

Don #8217;t know how much landline phones route through the Internet now, but they are likely vulnerable to disruptions too. Amateur radio isn #8217;t.

    <TEXT>The document specifies that the company was already issued a citation and apparently ignored it. Willful continued violations don #8217;t go over well. The most consumers would see would just be a notice that they are interfering with lawful communications and be told to stop. The FCC will even help find the offending device. If the consumer refuses to stop, however, that #8217;s when the FCC could get more  #8220;assertive #8221;. But this was a business selling radio equipment that they had been notified was out of compliance and transmitting illegally. They had been ordered to stop selling noncompliant equipment but kept right on doing it. You get in trouble fast if you are selling illegal equipment. Huge difference between that company and a consumer. This was an example of a company flaunting a direct order to cease and desist. The FCC has big enforcement powers because the actual damages from unlawful behavior can go all the way to threatening property and life. But a consumer causing interference can also be dealt with harshly if they are notified and refuse to comply. It was probably the refusal to comply with the previous citation that got them where they are now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interference is interference. The FCC doesn #8217;t just show up and hand you a fine. To know who is interfering - which the FCC has an obligation to investigate and correct - they would already be right outside your house to know it was you. First step would likely be a knock on your door to let you know and see if you needed help to find the offending device. Maybe the agent would have a bad day and be gruff but they aren #8217;t looking to fine you on first visit. It #8217;s only those who refuse to cooperate and keep interfering with lawful transmissions who get stepped on. Rightfully so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A friend has the nanovna-f which has a larger screen and a few other features, but he hasn #8217;t figured how to get the scan data back off yet since he doesn #8217;t have an Android phone. It may or may not be easy but he did memtion that. The nano looked good to me but I ordered the -f for the larger screen. If you are interested in the -f, I saw lots of complaints about the thumbwheel switch. There was a recent hardware update that along with getting lower noise and wider frequency response, there is now a version with select buttons instead of the thumbwheel. The [deepelec.com](https://deepelec.com) site is apparently the official outlet and they have the new versions. There appears to be lots of knockoffs on the market too. I ordered the -f (button version) a couple of weeks ago from deepelec but don #8217;t have it yet and not heard a peep. They showed as in stock when I ordered. It comes from China, though, so could be up to a month I guess. Meanwhile, I was able to dial in my antenna with the Zero. Beautiful high resolution scans on a big monitor. It did all the other calculations, phase, others, and Smith chart, but I don #8217;t know yet how to read those. Saved off the data to go back and re-review as I learn more. The Zero is a bare board, no display or housing, no calibration plugs, but I #8217;m going to work up and 3D print a housing. The nanovna-f has case and display but costs more. Couldn #8217;t tell you which is better now but will know more hopefully inside of 2 weeks or so. I #8217;m curious how much their scans will agree and now about getting data off the nano. I #8217;d like to think it shouldn #8217;t be that hard even if I have to write my own script.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ll post again when I get it. I wasn #8217;t very impressed with the Zero at first because the AntScope software wasn #8217;t that impressive and I couldn #8217;t run it on the Pi. I #8217;m putting a portable system together and I have all the other software I want to use on a Pi but couldn #8217;t verify antenna setups too well. Those SWR plots tell you right where you are and where you need to go. That changed when I found AntScope2 but it wouldn #8217;t run for me on Windows or on the Pi. That #8217;s when I suspected the firmware version and set about getting updated. Luckily I was able to do that on a Mac and AntScope2 just started working after that. The Zero is really nice now and I #8217;m hoping the nanovna-f is too. But for testing what the radio sees with a bigger display than a handheld, the Zero now rocks. If I can read the scan data into the Pi from the nano, that will even the playing field back up. I have no problem recommending the Zero though. I was able to bring my 10m half wave antenna into resonance with a 1.10 SWR on 28.074MHz, 15m came in at about 1.6, and 40 and 20m both came in about 5-6. I could see the whole frequency range of the Zero and plainly see what I needed to do and even about how much to trim. The screen grab at the top is what I started with. I cut the wire about a foot longer than the instructions which put the dip at about 24.5MHz with an SWR of 5 where I needed to go. Seeing that was invaluable. That was what was really cool. I could see where the antenna was resonant and convert that to wavelength, and do the same with the target frequency where I wanted to go. The difference was how much (approximately) I needed to trim so I could have more confidence in making those cuts. As I cut, I could easily check progress and watch the dip in SWR move and deepen as it neared the design frequency. It was an impressive capability. Next up is a multiband vertical. After I tuned up my antenna I got a station calling CQ on FT8 from about 1300 miles away on 10m. I think it was just lucky as the band seemed dead and that was all I saw, but I did hear that one and just the one time. For whatever that #8217;s worth. I #8217;m very constrained on antenna setups so for me just being able to see the big picture is invaluable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the Valve Index. Used to have the Vive Pro and a Vive before that. I love the Index.

They #8217;ve been shipping for almost a year and still being backordered. Others like the Oculus Rift, but the resolution is lower, narrower field of view, and the camera tracking may be where the industry is going but it #8217;s still not perfect. But you don #8217;t have to hang lighthouses. If you can, try any headsets you are considering. That #8217;s really the best way to know.

    <TEXT>It was something like that but I don #8217;t remember exactly what it said. But it was something that indicated it couldn #8217;t see it. Sorry I don #8217;t recall exactly. I knew it was connected properly and working since I have the Arduino development environment installed on both Windows and the Pi and could connect using the dev. environment #8217;s serial monitor tool. The zero was reporting properly there, I could do scans, etc. But after I flashed the firmware to 2.0, when I connected it up to the Pi and started AntScope2, it worked great and has been invaluable. I tuned up the 10m antenna first thing when I got it working, but since it #8217;s a wire and fairly directional, I reoriented it yesterday and checked the SWR to see if it had changed and sure enough it had. Luckily it was to resonating at a lower frequency again so tuning was just clipping off a bit more antenna and it #8217;s again optimized at least for SWR. It is hugely insightful to trim/tune up an antenna while watching the SWR curve instead of watching a meter swing or other indicator that doesn #8217;t let you see the shape of what you are tuning. As I was tuning the antenna, the low at resonance not only moved but the SWR curve changed in shape. If anyone is on the fence about an analyzer, I definitely recommend them. Antennas are a bit of a mystery (to me) but seeing the graphs turns them into tangible things. For those up for a Pi, it #8217;s not hard to get AntScope2 up and running with the Zero and is very inexpensive to get an amazing capability. The Pi also runs my data apps and radio control software so it makes for a very compact and portable setup. Highly recommended!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nvidia has a habit of hyping things that don #8217;t deliver at least initially. VR-SLI was another pig in a poke And a bunch of early adopters went out and bought second video cards only to wait a couple of years before it finally was realized. Even then, if developers didn #8217;t support it, second video cards were wasted. RTX is a little different. If Nvidia didn #8217;t devote silicon area to RTX, nobody would code for it. It was chicken and egg but we had to pay for a lot of wasted silicon to get RTX introduced. Nvidia does this kind of stuff over and over and it leaves a bad taste. They do have powerful graphics chips but you have to ignore Jensen #8217;s hype and just buy based on what the cards actually do and not what Jensen promises.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Vive got revisions that shaved weight, and there have been some other fixes for various headsets, but all in all, I've been enjoying my Index since the first shipment and don't regret buying day 1 at all. But it's like anything in life. You pay your money and take your chances. Similarly, early adopters tend to pay more. Not always true, but especially true if you buy from a scalper like many did. I took my chances and I couldn't be happier. Spent about three hours today flying a really beautiful P-47 around the skies. It was pretty wonderful in the Index. To each their own. I'll be a day 1 buy on the successor to the Index as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who doesn't like it only has themselves to blame. There was a big window where anyone who ordered before mid to late summer still would have had theirs for quite a few months. I totally get people who didn't have the money until now, but that's not Valve's fault. The people who I don't understand are those who think if they put their money down they should have one next day. The Index is very constrained by production with demand well above what can be sold. It's just how it is. I know you weren't on Valve, but others aren't so understanding. As to outrage being justified if Valve charged up front, no. Still not justified. Those would be the terms of the deal and anyone who enters into such a deal then complains would be a fool. But that's not what Valve is doing anyway so moot point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Newer cards tend to be much more efficient. Unfortunately it #8217;s not just core count. There #8217;s clock speed, memory bandwidth, and cuda core efficiency itself to compare and those vary even within a series (except for cuda core efficiency - I think.) To get the best card for your application you may need to check with others running those applications to see what they know. When we ran test applications on our systems there were wild differences in performance depending on what the application did the most of. If you just want to compare FLOPs, there #8217;s tables out there that have that comparison.

    <TEXT>The NanoVNA-F arrived yesterday and is a little jewel. 2 months for shipping so must come by ship for standard shipping. Very nicely packed with a nice fitted plastic/foam case and lots of accessories to calibrate with and do measurements. I got the demo card kit with it to try to understand what Smith plots are about and very much recommend that for anyone else wanting to see what the different circuit elements do. The NanoVNA-F is really nice. The display is bright, the finish is great. I am on a learning curve with it but it #8217;s very versatile. Navigating the menus is a little clunky but that should get better with getting used to it. You can use both buttons and touch screen to navigate. The buttons sometimes take an extra press for it to register but that #8217;s ok. The [AA-30.Zero](https://AA-30.Zero) is a bit more diy but would be easy to build into stuff. The Nano not so much probably. I really like them both. RigExpert is out with a new version of AntScope2 now that supports the Nano but just the basic one for now and apparently not all firmware versions. Really happy with both. I guess which one to get depends on what you want it for. For my needs, they are pretty equivalent. No idea which one is more accurate. The Nano seems to be a more versatile unit since it #8217;s self-contained and is ready to go. That may tip many to the Nano. I #8217;m building the Zero into my Pi box so it #8217;s ready to go just by connecting an antenna and running AntScope2. The Nano is a bit more delicate with the display and I don #8217;t want to scratch it so it isn #8217;t quite as knockabout. But it is definitely gorgeous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What eyelash and face contact will do is leave oils and smudges on your lenses that you then get to clean off, and that is a risk in and of itself. Lots of ways to scratch the plastic lenses while cleaning them - dust getting ground in, dirty cleaning cloth (especially those microfiber ones) carrying grit, etc. The plano lenses are glass and stand up to those things much much better. Replacing or "fixing" the plastic lenses is an ordeal. Better to do everything you can to avoid it. The down side is plano lenses distance you even further from the actual lenses which decreases field of view. The choice probably depends on how much you share your headset and how much care you take in cleaning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People do this especially in cooperative scenarios where you can see the other person's head and hands, or more if you use the Tracker pucks. I'm not familiar with games that allow this but bet there are. Each person's space needs to be absolute coordinates (no transporting) so you know where you see the other person is actually where they are. Definitely not recommended if your play spaces overlap and you are doing your own things. But if your space is big enough and you chaperone down to keep each person safely in their own space, it works fine. But you do need a separate computer. VR is just too demanding to run two headsets like the Index. It's no problem sharing base stations AFAIK. Something would have had to change to stop that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As feature size gets smaller, so do the voltages that will punch through the insulating layer. The device has to be operated at lower voltage or it self destructs. 1 volt across a 1 nm insulator is the same voltage stress as 1,000,000,000 volts across 1 meter. In air that #8217;s big lightning. As feature sizes get smaller - and whichever process these are using, they are smaller features than ever in Nvidia GPUs - voltages have to be more tightly controlled. You can #8217;t tolerate as much ripple because the peaks may be too much stress to not cause breakdown, arcs, and chip death. The problem is compounded if you are using more current with a big chip with lots of transistors. One answer to lower ripple is more phases delivering smaller bites of current more frequently. Another way of effectively getting more phases is to up the switching frequency. Depending on what the designers had to balance, it could be coil whine might even move to higher frequencies we can #8217;t hear. It #8217;s a system with lots of considerations so who knows? But it is a possibility. With operation and destruction moving closer together, these new chips may be less able to be overclocked through over and undervolting. There may be some headroom but voltage uniformity across a chip starts getting tougher to manage. It #8217;s one of the consequences of moving to smaller feature size. Voltage becomes more critical. It could also be that we are moving away from users being able to tweak and overclock as much as we used to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Undervolting really helps temperatures if you can do it. All depends on the silicon lottery how much you can get out of it. Not sure if you want to do it, especially if you are still in any warranty negotiations (and at least some 20 series cards are getting scarce now too), but what you describe could just be a bad thermal connection between the GPU and the heat sink. Even from the factory it happens and not all factories/brands are equal. Re-applying good thermal paste properly might fix you up. As an aside, a long time ago my brother was having his computer just randomly lock up on him. He also had bought a prebuilt and whoever was building them was applying a tamper tape to the top of the CPU and then putting the heat sink over that. Brilliant. I took off the tamper tape, properly gooped the heat sink with Arctic Silver, and he never had a problem with it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sure there are YouTube videos on how to do it. Maybe even for your exact card. It #8217;s not difficult to do but if you don #8217;t have experience with it, you can make the situation worse (if this is the issue at all) all the way to killing the card. By opening up the card, you can also damage it in a number of new ways. Not trying to discourage you from doing it. Just saying you might want to watch a few how-tos and then decide if it is something you could do. I would guess your card uses paste, but it might also use thermal pads, or a combination of both depending on the component. I would also guess the initial application was done by machine but I don #8217;t know that. Since you were getting warranty work, could you have gotten used parts when they swapped things out? If so, anything could have changed. Also, when you split the heat sink away from the GPU, the heat sink may also have other pads for other parts. If there are, you get to deal with those too. And you never goop parts, put them together, pull them apart to see how you did, and put them back together again as final assembly. That traps air and messes with heat transfer. You can and probably should verify your technique by pulling the parts back apart and making sure you got good coverage, but then you have to clean them all up and start again from scratch. There #8217;s also  #8220;pre-wetting #8221; and how much thermal compound to use. Maybe special patterns to use as well. Line, dot, dots, lines. The Arctic Silver folks have great guides on how to apply compound but other materials may have guides specific to them as well. On the surface it seems trivial, but there is a lot of detail involved to do the application properly. Good applications can definitely lower component temperatures.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>FS2020 real-world aircraft flying in the sim - ADS-B data</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-21 13:19:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>[https://flightaware.com/news/article/Announcing-FlightAware-and-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-Partnership/1477](https://flightaware.com/news/article/Announcing-FlightAware-and-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-Partnership/1477) FS2020 is able to use real world ADS-B data reporting to populate the virtual skies. The data is 5 minutes delayed from real time but you can watch and fly with actual aircraft as they navigate through the skies. You can also set up your own ADS-B receiving station and add to that dataset and make the flight data in your area even more accurate. You also see the raw data from your receiver before all the privacy requests to suppress flight info are applied. Receiving stations are cheap and easy to set up. They use a Raspberry Pi computer, a $22-25 ADS-B receiver, a $10-40 antenna, and a few other bits. Total cost is generally $100-150 depending on what parts you go with. [https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build) Set up your own ADS-B receiving node and you can watch aircraft in your area, up to 250nm out, in real time and at far better resolution than you see on the public flight tracking pages. It #8217;s very cool. Life flights, police, airliners, private aircraft, mapping aircraft, firefighting aircraft, test/training flights, etc. If it #8217;s ADS-B equipped, you see it. (US military aircraft can and often do disable ADS-B reporting) Another perk is if you run an ADS-B reporting node, FlightAware gives you a free  #8220;Enterprise Account #8221; that gives you a lot more access to flight data than the public gets. They charge $90/mo for that normally but give it away free to those who supply ADS-B data. There #8217;s a message board where you can see what these cheap little receivers can do, where others ask/answer questions, post about notable activity, etc. [https://discussions.flightaware.com](https://discussions.flightaware.com) You might be surprised at all the real-world traffic you see. There is so much more happening above us than people know. I #8217;ve watched Virgin Galactic shakedown flights, fire fighting, protest monitoring, survey/mapping flights, routing around severe weather, aircraft test flights, medivac/rescue flights, formation glider flights, Google  #8220;Loon #8221; balloons, and from my node I can even watch ground ops at a couple of airports - one 50 miles away. As soon as they fire up the avionics, they pop up on the display and I can watch them taxi out and take off. What you can see and how far out depends on your antenna and location. If you have clear sky views you can see way out. I have mountains near me in some directions and they blank traffic, but I can see 200-250nm miles out in other directions. If you want to help improve the tracking of real-world flights in your area, that #8217;s how you do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not all paste is equal and some thermal compounds could be incompatible with materials used in your card. I #8217;ve always gone with Arctic Silver for standard stuff but I #8217;m sure there are other good brands. If you are going to re-paste, might read the guides and see some more how-to videos. There is definitely a technique and there are ways to do harm. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Buying when they first hit the market is always a risk. I go EVGA but they had issues with some boards for the 20 series. Metal labels falling off, really buggy fan profile and overclocking software, etc. Probably similar stories on other cards. It #8217;s a gamble. AIB partners stand a good chance of being rushed. Hopefully they get the big bugs ironed out but you don #8217;t find out until later how they did. Nvidia cards tend to run hot, though, and Nvidia doesn #8217;t seem to like doing all the overclock/monitor utilities of the AIB partners. It #8217;s a little risky buying day 1 but the alternative is to wait and be stuck with everyone else waiting for the one card that did everything right. You can hit a whole range of problems that can even lead to board swaps. Or wait months to snag one of the problem free boards after everyone else is also hunting it. You pays your money and you takes your chances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Twice here. Was caught up in the 1080 hot regulators bit but they made it right. First by sending out replacement thermal transfer materials, then outright swapping up the card to a better model and gave me a power supply to boot. EVGA has stood behind their cards big time. The only issue I #8217;ve had where I #8216;ve been disappointed, sort of, has been their overclocking software for the 20 series. Took way too long to get functional software.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends. Overheat the chip and you #8217;re right. You can damage it. But if you just go too fast for the propagation delays and signals aren #8217;t solid at the signal level they are supposed to be when read, you can still get data corruption without hurting the chip. Obviously running chips faster generates more heat. I #8217;m only talking about signals not having time to rise enough or settle. That can also cause data corruption.</TEXT>

All you need are bezels, knobs, switches, and levers in the right locations. 3D printers are very handy to print everything out. You see the actual dials, gauges, etc, in VR and can reach out and touch them in real life which helps complete the illusion. Adjustment knobs, dials, and switches can actually work and change things in sim with cheap and simple ready-built electronics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way that sticks up so tall, if that #8217;s correct, will put that connector in danger. Tall components can get broken off or bent over if people aren #8217;t careful. Looks too delicate for the general public to me. It #8217;s also odd unless there are two I think. To go from two 8 pin connectors to one 12? That seems like it could be on lower power cards to only use a single 12 pin and higher power cards use two? Hard to know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The shroud will have to protect it from bending moments when connecting and disconnecting the power cable. Being tall like that will make it especially critical and the shroud will need to have physical contact with that connector body. It #8217;s no problem for those that are careful, but I don #8217;t see any way that connector and where it bonds to the board won #8217;t get stressed. Hopefully it #8217;s a through-hole part for strength.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Things always seem overly expensive until you know the actual costs involved. That makes a lot of expensive things a bit more reasonable. Every step is also the potential for lost boards though for this, that #8217;s probably all they lose. Guaranteed those are expensive boards. And sure, Nvidia makes their cuts too. Anyone who wants some of that loot can always start a rival company with rival products and show Nvidia how it #8217;s done. But this additional step of back drilling is sound and increases the maximum frequency of signals you can put on/in those boards. The physics and electrical bits it is based on are very real. It is not just a gimmick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Significant difference between FE and AIB. Nvidia made a big deal about the cooling design and it could be good. The hybrid blower design circulates a lot of air while splitting some out the back. People will just need to make sure they don #8217;t have all fans aimed out to where the blower is fighting lower pressure in the box. AIBs seem to be mostly circulate box air designs and you need to be responsible to change the box air out yourself with your case fan arrangements. Hard to say yet which is better in practice. I do like the FE design, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At least that we know of - yet. I don #8217;t remember when we found out about A stock with the 20 series, but chip-to-chip variations are real and certainly are used to segregate chips by performance limits. The only question is if Nvidia is performance testing and grading chips to know which ones have the highest overclock potential. My personal guess is that they are at some level and it would make sense to mark the good ones with a grade of some sort. Seems logical based on past behavior and utility (opportunity to charge more). I hope they are. ;-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think enthusiasts are more than ready but the general public may be having a tough go keeping their houses. I would bet there is a chunk of available market missing this launch and there will be less pressure on supply. Similarly, the simultaneous launches for sales also helps all vendors. If the market is too soft, some board makers could see excess stock and associated costs while those shipping early could saturate the market otherwise. It #8217;s really hard to know how it will break and where the board makers are aiming numbers-wise. What we do know is a lot of the world is holding its breath right now just because of world events, and some significant portion is also working reduced hours, has reduced income, etc. But there could be supply side pressures too that cut into how many can even be made. Luckily a lot of the manufacturing is in regions that were much smarter about covid prep and behavior and are at better capacity for normal work. Could be in balance we get lots of supply and demand is softer making it where everyone can get their card of choice more easily. 3090 buyers will want to watch the 3080 launch very closely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why do you assume it #8217;s poorly designed? If you are an EE, you know that current flows when charging/discharging capacitors. There may be some leakage especially as feature sizes and insulation layers get smaller/thinner, but a fat lot of the current flow is because transistors are switching on and off. Current goes way up when the chip is working. Nvidia is really designing the logic and memory that let the chips do their thing. The process folks turn that into actual structures to be created on chip to do the functions Nvidia logic designers specify. There is a lot of translation between logic/memory functions down to the physical structures. But if the chips work and do their jobs, the logic design is good. So that leaves the process/chip side but even then, there are limitations in process, silicon, reagents, etc. The chip is a system. There was a lot of discussion about TSMC vs Samsung and who preferred what and why. If you don #8217;t like the Samsung process, then ask why Nvidia went with them. Maybe TSMC was already committed or couldn't hit necessary targets? But it #8217;s much more complex than Nvidia having a crappy design.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK, then your beef is not with the chip design per se but with the process that fit more transistors on the die. Alternatives might have been to delay the fabrication until TSMC was available (if TSMC wasn't available), or possibly price. Maybe Samsung was cheaper than TSMC for the conditions Nvidia needed. At any rate, it could have been to get a little more power efficient chip would have meant delays or price increases, or maybe something else entirely. Few decisions are made in a vacuum. More than likely there were discussions on cost/time/yield/production volume and Samsung on the whole was the better deal. But none of this points to poorly designed chip architecture. It points to tradeoffs that were balanced to get a card to market fastest and cheapest that people would be able to buy. What the actual considerations were is anyone's' guess, but doubtful that Jensen made the call to use Samsung because he likes his cards long, thick, and power hungry. Things like these video cards are extremely complex and necessarily have many compromises in the design process. That's just how this stuff works. As an EE, you will need to become familiar with these processes if you want to work with silicon instead of just declaring the chips poorly designed. Until you can point by point show why these chips are poorly designed and why they should have made different decisions based on the information they had at the time they had to make those decisions, you don't have a leg to stand on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You blamed Nvidia for a bad design with no support for the statement. I #8217;m saying we don #8217;t know all the considerations. The chip obviously works but it uses a lot of power and makes a lot of heat. It could be that getting new video cards that were more efficient power-wise would mean bigger and more expensive silicon, lower yields, and higher prices, or delays while Nvidia queued into TSMC #8217;s production schedule with whatever other changes that would bring. What I took issue with was someone on the outside looking in claiming the chip was  #8220;poorly designed #8221;. That kind of process is a lot of compromises and basically tuning things to get a usable product out the door. If your beef is the power consumption of a working chip, what would the consequences be of doing things your way? When would we get the 30 series and what would it cost? I #8217;m betting you don #8217;t know unless TSMC issued a statement telling the world they would meet or beat Samsung #8217;s schedule, would make them smaller and more power efficient, and do it all at the same cost to Nvidia, and Nvidia decided they just wanted a hotter chip.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also like the Nvidia cooling design. Part blower to push the hottest air out of the box could be a big factor in keeping a box cool. Except for the water blocks, all the other designs draw from and dump back into the box itself making rapid exchange of box air more important. How well it works in practice is a tougher call. We #8217;ll just need to see benchmarks to know for sure. Smaller boxes with fewer fans might see more benefit to Nvidia #8217;s design than bigger, well-ventilated boxes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What so many miss is that PSU quality is fundamental. You want clean power to max load. Everything can clock higher with better power. Motherboards and GPUs have power supplies but cleaner power in = cleaner power out. As power supplies run closer to their maximum output, the regulation gets harder. The power supply has to store energy from crest to trough from the AC line. At some point, it can use up stores and then voltage drops until the next crest. That #8217;s ripple that other supplies have to filter out. The AC line also can have lots of noise from inductive loads and such. That can be as bad or worse to deal with. Good filtering is important, too. The box power supply is the first line of defense for clean power. You want a good one that is working in its rating sweet spot - not a cheap one straining under load.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don #8217;t know the supply and we don #8217;t know the demand. That makes it impossible to know how hard these will be to get. There is obviously demand, maybe more  #8220;want #8221; than the 20 series since there is more of a performance jump and a lot of people held onto their 10 series cards. But many now in the US are fearful of losing jobs, have more pressing issues, etc, right now, and might not be so quick to part with what amounts to a house or rent payment for many. On the other hand, many are justifying computer purchases for quarantine which could increase demand. Meanwhile, this is a new process for Nvidia/Samsung on one of the biggest pieces of silicon to see it. Yield issues could make a big dent in supply and restrict availability. That #8217;s a wild card. These cards are also being built during a pandemic when supply chains are disrupted. All it takes is a shortage of a single component to stop a line until that component is again available. There was also an online article saying yields might be running lower and Nvidia might have trouble meeting demand. They went on to say that boards will get really scarce after launch because of that. No idea if any truth to it, but here is the article: [https://www.tweaktown.com/news/74915/exclusive-geforce-rtx-30-series-cards-tight-supply-until-end-of-year/index.html](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/74915/exclusive-geforce-rtx-30-series-cards-tight-supply-until-end-of-year/index.html) So it is very hard to say how this will all break. Unknown supply. Likely big demand but possible issues there too. And god only knows what will happen even in just the weeks until sales start on 3080 and 3090. We will certainly find out, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a reason they put all those connectors on a board - to reduce voltage drop in the cables. Cables have a small amount of resistance that causes the voltage to be reduced at the card. More current means less voltage at the card. By using a splitter you run all the current through just one cable and get the maximum voltage drop. You would get higher voltage at your card if you used proper cabling. The other way is a kludge. It can work, but it also might not. In your case, it sounds like your card can tolerate the reduced voltage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use PX1 with my card. It took EVGA quite a long time to get a build that even worked. The overclock testing would hang, the software wouldn #8217;t remember settings at one point. It was really crap. I even had to rescue my card from a failed BIOS update. They finally released a version that worked and I could get an overclock curve, save it and my fan curves, and load them back in. But it took way too many software revisions to get there. They released the 20 series and their software simply wasn #8217;t ready. But PX1 has improved and now works well. I hope it #8217;s ready for the 30 series.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How is your case ventilation? I keep my card between 40 and 50C and no problems at all. 85C is getting toasty and may damage the card/GPU after a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Others say 80C is ok, but I disagree. As feature sizes get smaller, diffusion in the silicon gets more important and higher temperatures promote that. High temperatures also can make localized hotspots hit thermal runaway and transistors to stick on. It may take it for a while but heat is always hard on components and it sounds like your whole case is getting hot. Make sure you have a good flow pattern in your case. Low fans blowing in and fans higher up blowing out. If all fans are blowing out you can starve them all and greatly reduce air flow. Depending if you have vents to admit air into the case, you generally want to match CFM out with CFM in, though good vents let you have more fans blowing out. I push my 2080Ti hard but card temps never go above 60. To get those temps I run aggressive curves on my card and also on my CPU radiator and all temperature-controlled fans. If your case is small and tightly-packed, you may need to just get a new and bigger case with better ventilation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good for you. It doesn #8217;t make sense to buy a lot of power if you don #8217;t need it. But the 2080Ti was still a powerhouse. Not as big of a jump over the 10 series as many hoped, but that was the compromise between silicon and function at that feature size. It was still a very powerful card. People who bought it needed or wanted the extra capability even if it did cost significantly more than a 2080. I need the power. It was hardly an unwise decision. I #8217;ll be buying a 3090 too if I can snag one. That #8217;s not an unwise purchase either. But maybe either would be unwise if you only get an allowance from mom or dad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Frame draw time is the sum of CPU time and GPU time. Some things are concurrent, but even if  #8220;bottlenecked #8221;, a faster GPU will still be done with data and ready for more faster than a slow GPU. You still see frame rate increases, just not as big as if you got the fastest of both. From my understanding, higher frame rates and lower resolution will shift the load more to the CPU. But you can also crank up the other effects that are GPU-based like various AA types. Lots say there isn #8217;t much speed difference between i7 and i9 for many or most gaming applications but that #8217;s certainly qualified and overclockability can be another factor. But a new mobo might get you faster RAM capability and that helps the CPU side of the equation if you get faster RAM. At least that #8217;s my understanding.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best Buy Curbside Pickup</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 13:28:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was just checking my local Best Buy and they are showing the 3090 FE and one model of Gigabyte card for now, maybe more later. For 3080 they show the FE, and one model Gigabyte, and one model MSI cards. They are now my fallback shop if I can #8217;t snag a card online. They don #8217;t open until later (nothing showing on special hours for the Nvidia debuts) and they let you online order and do curbside pickup. Best Buy might even be a good primary location. The city I #8217;m in probably barely supports a Best Buy so though stock might be limited, there probably/hopefully aren #8217;t many around that even know what these cards are. If I snag one at Best Buy I #8217;ll have to pay local sales tax, but that #8217;s now true for most online vendors too. I #8217;m definitely going to talk with them and see how 3080 sales go to get a better idea of what to expect next week with the 3090s and go FE, though first choice is an EVGA FTW3 Ultra. Good luck and be safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe. I used to work with clusters that used lots of fiber adapters for interconnect and networking. We had to replace the transmitters a lot and receivers too but not as much. That was expensive. If the lasers get pushed hard - which they generally are - they don #8217;t last all that long. Obviously they could be tuned to last longer with short haul runs, but replaceable fiber adapters are pretty big physically so there #8217;s that too. It #8217;s just engineering to meet design goals, but fiber optics aren #8217;t necessarily a panacea. You would have to look at PCI bus data rates to get a better idea. It could be you need more than just one tx/rx pair at each end. I only mention it because it is also a consideration that might increase complexity and cost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There have been problems with Digital River. I got the joy of living them when I got my Vive. It did all work out, though. My order was just delayed about a month. In my case they did something funky with what they were sending to card companies and the card companies just blocked payment thinking it was fraud. The whole first wave of shipments went to whoever was next in line after Digital River figured out they blew it. For those stuck having to deal with them, my advice is keep things as simple as possible and be ready if your credit card company has any issues with payments going to them. Monitor whatever method your card company uses to alert you of fraud so you can head it off at the pass. Even better, notify your credit card company that you are expecting a charge from them and you approve it as legitimate. They may screw it up some other way, though. They #8217;ve botched more than one launch. If you can, don #8217;t do things like use different billing and shipping addresses, or anything that might trip them up. My experience was they just cancel your order and move to the next in line instead of trying to resolve. They did fix things but again, it meant a big delay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While that may ultimately be true for those who are willing to wait (it was true for me), from the product launches I #8217;ve seen them handle, some get royally screwed and just get a refund if the money is successfully debted, or cancel and move on if not. Digital River unfortunately earned a reputation for screwing orders up and not being easy to work with. In my case they did screw the order up but I did get my order - just a month late. While getting a person on the line to fix things wasn #8217;t easy, they were courteous and did fix things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It may not. It #8217;s been a while since my experience with them but IIRC, that was another factor that screwed things up. But I could be remembering that wrong - a few years ago now. My problem was my card company flagged the charge as a fraud. I #8217;m just saying, if you can, to not make anything more complicated with them and monitor however your card company notifies you of fraud since that was the big one for me. By the time I saw the fraud notice, DR had already canceled my order. They wasted no time on fixing a crap ton of denied charges - almost the entire first wave stock - fixed their issue, and moved on to what should have been the second wave.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a bus in the box for each voltage. Each gets connected up to each connector in parallel. I think what they want is a separate wire and connector set for each terminal on the card. If you use local to the card Y adapters, the long wires can end up carrying more current than possibly designed for. And the direction of the Y is important. Nvidia supplies a Y with the FEs that combines two power cables into a single connector for the FE but they can also size the wires and connectors appropriately and what you are doing is splitting the current between two cables and connectors. What you don't want is one wire set that gets split with a Y to feed two connectors on the board. That basically doubles the current on the single cable/connector and can even be dangerous in the worst case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, those who sleeve their power cables can make the problem even wirse. High currents lead to I2R heating. If the wire can dissipate the heat, great. It may not overheat and melt insulation since there is cooling air to carry away excess heat. Sleeve the wire and you basically insulate them. If enough heat gets trapped then temperatures can possibly go high enough to cause problems.</TEXT>

If so, the FEs might all get/need water blocks retrofitted by buyers? 3090s might not sell so well. Those will get even hotter since not cut down chips. I had high hopes for Nvidia #8217;s half-blower design but sagging clocks from heat is not a good sign. If that #8217;s what #8217;s being said, FEs might be easy to get.

I #8217;d rather not even have to worry about it. So it costs a little more? No anguish about  #8220;will it work #8221; or needing to replace if I upgrade other stuff.

    <TEXT>Thanks for going into the detail you did. I don #8217;t bother because most don #8217;t understand the consequences of it. Today #8217;s chips run at low voltages and the ripple just asks more of motherboard and GPU power sections especially since the ripple gets worse at higher power demands. Keeping ripple to a minimum is why so many power phases in motherboard and GPU power sections. It #8217;s why the premium GPU supplies have even more phases than the reference designs. Supplies rated for higher power have bigger inductors to be able to store more energy during low points in a cycle. That helps reduce ripple on the outputs which means less trouble for the next power supply in line, better signals, and better reliability, and for many, higher clocks. For anyone who wants to overclock, clean power gives more headroom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just seeing if a power supply will run without tripping is the practical way to address this but doesn #8217;t give much insight into what is going on. A much better test would be to see how high a specific card will overclock. Power supplies have a number of different specifications and ripple is one of them. The more ripple on the lines, the harder it is for onboard supplies to deliver clean power and force lower clocks to give more time for unambiguous signal levels. You have to run farther from the edges because there is more noise on the lines. All this guy did was say yup, it runs, which is helpful, but if your power supply is barely able to keep up, ripple and noise will be greatest. You will have little or no headroom for overclocking - both in terms of power and noise on the lines. Here #8217;s an example of ripple measurements at Tom #8217;s Hardware: [https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-rm550x-power-supply,4484-8.html](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-rm550x-power-supply,4484-8.html) Underrated supplies may run a card but dirty power an makes overclocking CPU, GPU, and memory harder and could force clock slowdowns to get a system to run again. Not in any way saying people shouldn #8217;t run a low power power supply. Just that they should be aware of the consequences. Lighter loaded supplies (those with higher ratings) will have more stable and cleaner power and allow higher clocks than one struggling to carry the load at each zero crossing on the AC lines. Also, people should not assume all brands can do this at the same power supply ratings. Corsair makes good supplies. No name knockoffs may not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good luck on a 4k Quest. Zuckerberg would rather sell cheap to be able to monitor more eyes. Otherwise, I agree. There is a real good FS2020 benchmark where they look at what bottlenecks based on resolution and video card (does not include the 3000 series though). The trend is clear that high resolution and/or VR shifts the load to the GPU and would benefit from a 3090. https://www.tomshardware.com/features/microsoft-flight-simulator-benchmarks-performance-system-requirements It's a good read.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Then it wasn't a very comprehensive test. The results will be different for other brands and ratings. If people want to know if their brand and model will work, unless it was one of the ones tested, they still don't really know. The test is a good one in that people know it might work, but it isn't a guarantee. Running a card stock on low margin power supplies doesn't give you much information. It's an indirect measure, but that's why I said a better method would be to see what kind of clocks you can hit on a given card with each supply. As power supplies like these load up, they fall out of spec due to voltage sagging and ripple. Both of those get more pronounced as you near the limits of what a supply can deliver. It's a chain. Give an on-board supply trash power and the GPU and memory will see more noise on their mains. More noise makes for more uncertainty in the data levels and necessitates slower clocks. Also important to keep in mind that these new GPUs and memory are using 4-state bits by using intermediate voltage levels. That makes it even more important to have clean power. You would have to know the full specs on the on-board VRM section to know how much of an effect, but it's a safe bet there will be an effect. Some manufacturers already add extra phases to premium cards. That reduces ripple. I would love to see a overclock capability benchmark based on how heavy power supplies are loaded. I think it would be very interesting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you read the responses here, some are extrapolating to whatever 550 or 600W supply they have. It's why Nestledrink added the pinned caution. People need to understand that even of the same model, if he was on the edge, a different supply might not get him there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coil whine is due to the switching frequency dropping into the audible range as a supply struggles to deliver the power requested and hold the rails at spec voltage. It's making up for low voltage/high demand by taking bigger/longer bites of current off of its supply lines. It is a sign of power supplies working at their limits because you start hitting regimes where the inductors can saturate and stop behaving properly too far out of their design frequencies. As the main supply falls out of spec, the mobo and GPU supplies have to make do with whatever lower voltage and switching noise they are left with which pushes them to the limit and impacts the circuitry they serve. Noise is everything at the frequencies these cards operate at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know if the card power supplies are fixed frequency or not but if they vary in frequency, you might be seeing effects from your power supply and/or cabling. Whine can be caused by stressed supplies dropping operating frequency to get more power from a main supply. Are you using any Y adapters to fill the power ports but not bring all wires to the card? The changing pitch indicates a possible loading issue. 750W should otherwise be good apparently but cheap supplies may sag more as the load up and that may be making your card work harder and drops the switching frequency into the audible range. Hard to say for certain, but I #8217;d be tempted to swap in a good name brand power supply and use a separate cable for every power connector on the card.</TEXT>

The only good thing about the prospects is that video cards since the 1000 series support rendering two eye views simultaneously and Microsoft is also involved in the Reverb G2 and VR development in FS2020.

    <TEXT>So, all card manufacturers should stockpile production for an additional how many months? Rent how much warehouse space? Borrow how much to buy all the parts required to build them and accrue how much interest? All of that means your chances of getting a card go to zero and hold there for however long manufacturers stockpile. This is just what happens. At product launches demand exceeds supply. The blame here is with Nvidia and their embargoes. Those should have all been lifted during Jensen #8217;s keynote. Lifting them launch minute means people are in a mad rush to buy something and end up buying the wrong and/or multiple cards. It causes churn, returns, and wasted everything. This is on Nvidia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If only Nvidia allowed preorders and then just worked through the queue. But that leads to order churn as people make and cancel preorders. And that is at least in part due to Jensen wanting all reviews held until orders open. He does it to himself and us. It #8217;s bad policy. We need an open system like others have. Full disclosure and then a resilient preorder system where people come and go freely, status is updated, and people know where they are in the queue. At some point they are given a deadline like 24 hours to pay if they still want a card. If they pay in time they get a card. If not, they lose that place in line. One per customer on preorders with periodic updates on anticipated ship times or the ability to check online at will.</TEXT>

A single POSCAP fills those stations so the max number of POSCAPs is six. That #8217;s what Zotac uses on at least some of their boards. Each station can have 10 MLCC caps instead of one POSCAP. A number of boards have 5 POSCAPs and one set of 10 MLCC caps. The ASUS cards are all MLCC so instead of 6 POSCAPs, they have 60 MLCC caps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or, you could say these cards use two different kinds of capacitors in this section that perform two different jobs. One is better to suppress ripple and the other is better at higher frequency switching noise. The optimum combination is whatever reduces both to manageable levels. Though the boards even from different manufacturers look the same or similar, there can actually be key differences to make the optimum capacitor combination for one board different from another board. What matters is minimizing both kinds of noise. If a particular model used one set of ceramic caps and the rest polys, or all ceramics as in the ASUS case, if the engineers looked at and minimized the noise, that #8217;s all that matters. What matters is the optimum combination was chosen for that model board. What that combination is does not matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you read Igor #8217;s articles on the polycap issue, he notes that the power demands can change very fast. That display is going to average a lot of the peaks out because it is too slow to show you the real max/mins. Anyone who looks at that and thinks they can get away with a 600W supply is misinformed. It may work in some applications but those peaks you don #8217;t see in that display can crash the card or mobo. I really don #8217;t understand why people think it #8217;s good to push power supplies that hard. Get one with headroom. When you posh them hard they have less reserves for peak loads, more ripple, and more noise. You don #8217;t want that.</TEXT>

It would give some speed increase but not sure if they could do that without some board changes to optimize for a TSMC process chip. Supposedly the 3090 is a maxed-out chip, though. Where they can just enable some extra cuda cores and whatnot on a 3080 to up the performance, that is supposedly not an option on the 3090.

    <TEXT>Both. There is a performance decrease of a few fps maximum, and a reduction in maximum clocks. Not a big one, though. But it all adds up to more and more rushing by Nvidia and not testing properly because of it. Plus Nvidia #8217;s go to is to reduce performance - which it apparently has to be. My reasoning is with this new revelation on top of the cap issue, what else is lurking? Plus it doesn #8217;t look like cards are available anyway. China is about to shut production for a week, scalpers are running wild with the low supplies, and store websites crash under load every time they get stock. Waiting for rev 2 will only get better performance and will benefit from lessons learned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s interesting seeing how swapping poly for MLCC fixes the issue on some cards. That said, some cards were resetting with all configurations. It #8217;s in the article. This is just a way to fix it across the board without reworking more cards or acknowledgement of an issue that keeps the cards from hitting spec. Nvidia tried to sweep it under the rug. Early on Nvidia was hoping to hit 2.1GHz to tie in with all the other 21 year things. They didn #8217;t make it. Nvidia rushed the launch to upstage AMD. I draw the line at rolling back performance on cards already sold to users.</TEXT>

Wherever you work, if somebody #8216;s productivity is being held back by a computer that is slow or incapable of doing the things an employee needs to do, the company/organization/whatever is almost always shortchanging itself by not providing a system that is up to the task. It #8217;s an employee bottleneck. I understand not every business can afford to do that but many can. If your organization can, you might point your IT guy at articles that discuss the costs of worker productivity being hobbled by a tool like a computer. People are expensive.

    <TEXT>Should also add that FS2020 is missing a lot of systems. It #8217;s not yet a  #8220;study level #8221; sim for accurate flight training though it #8217;s situational awareness is great and the graphic depiction is amazing. It also still lacks VR though that is coming sometime in the coming month or two, supposedly around the time HP #8216;s Reverb G2 headset comes out. FS2020 is marketed by Microsoft but developed by Asobo - a French game studio. The underlying flight code is reportedly from FSX using Asobo #8217;s graphics engine and integration. It is beautiful, though. The hands down best scenery among P3D, DCS, and FSX. Prepar3D (P3D) is a study level sim with pretty much all systems modeled depending on the aircraft. Lots depends on the individual aircraft on how study level it is. The VR support is great but between FS2020 and P3D, FS2020 is the more beautiful and real looking. It #8217;s the graphics engine and P3D needs an update now, if for no other reason than to increase performance. P3D is Microsoft #8217;s flight simulator for flight training, but updated and advanced by Lockheed-Martin. You are supposed to use P3D for educational/flight training use instead of entertainment according to the academic license. DCS is sort of a study level sim. Certainly if you want to fly mil/combat sorties it #8217;s study level but forget civilian aviation. It #8217;s a combat and formation flight/military aerobatics sim and the aerobatics groups love DCS. Some amazing formation and aerobatics work going on in DCS and a wolfpack of aircraft heading into a fight is an amazing experience in VR. It is just stunning and you can fly modern jets and vintage props. The multiplayer facilities/code are amazing. But scenery areas are very limited and you have to buy each area besides the default map, and all the planes are pretty expensive. It must be mentioned that DCS/Eagle Dynamics is a Russian company with one guy arrested for trying to obtain export-controlled information on the F-16 Falcon a year or so ago. ([https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/15/18623545/eagle-dynamics-f-16-manual-conspiracy-smuggling-russia](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/15/18623545/eagle-dynamics-f-16-manual-conspiracy-smuggling-russia)) Like World of Tanks and a number of other combat sims made by Russian companies, you are putting Russian software on your system. Some care. Some don #8217;t. X-Plane is mostly civilian and in the same vein as P3D and FS2020. It #8217;s been a major competitor to FSX and P3D for years. I usually don #8217;t fly XP so can #8217;t really comment.</TEXT>

[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/don-jr-thinks-trump-is-acting-crazy-presidents-covid-joyride-has-family-divided](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/don-jr-thinks-trump-is-acting-crazy-presidents-covid-joyride-has-family-divided)  #8220;According to sources, Don Jr. has told friends that he tried lobbying **Ivanka Trump,** **Eric Trump**, and **Jared Kushner** to convince the president that he needs to stop acting unstable.  #8220;Don Jr. has said he wants to stage an intervention, but Jared and Ivanka keep telling Trump how great he #8217;s doing, #8221; a source said. Don Jr. is said to be reluctant to confront his father alone.  #8220;Don said,  #8216;I #8217;m not going to be the only one to tell him he #8217;s acting crazy, #8217; #8221; the source added. #160; #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This. Trump is literally high on steroids right now with a few more days to go. Meanwhile, his extremely out of shape body is being racked. Plus, he is interfering in his own care and countermanding doctor advice. He owns stock in a company and amazingly got their unproven cocktail as part of his treatment. Trump is what is known as a  #8220;VIP patient #8220;. They think they know enough to run their own treatment and that frequently ends badly. It #8217;s obvious Trump was directing his medical team and is likely so pumped up on drugs (as evidenced by his more than normal manic overload tweets) that he really does think his large  #8220;uh-brain #8221; is qualified. Dexamethasone is a very strong euphoric and makes people feel invincible. While his body needs rest, it #8217;s likely he is overriding doctor #8217;s guidance and also likely he won #8217;t report any changes for the worse. Defendants acting as their own lawyers generally have fools for clients and similar can be said for patients acting as their own doctors. Trump #8217;s true state will be known when he collapses somewhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is that chance. He feels great now but he #8217;s high on a steroid well-known for its feelings of euphoria and invincibility. He should be resting and recuperating but instead wants to be on the campaign trail. He is setting himself up for the ubiquitous covid crash. When it happens to a 74 year old fat man with all sorts of other medical issues, it stands an excellent chance of being fatal.</TEXT>

We #8217;re starting to see discussions of legal issues for the whole Trump family now that a second term and a republican senate are less likely. Even if Pence pardons him after he runs, if he runs, they have numerous state charges waiting. Trump will have to leave the country to a country without extradition treaties who is willing to take him. Most likely Russia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I almost feel sorry for Trump #8217;s children. From the start of their lives they have been exposed to and brainwashed by a raving narcissistic sociopath just as Trump was raised by his own dysfunctional family. But that doesn #8217;t let the kids off the hook for their own behavior just as it doesn #8217;t let dad off the hook for his. That family chooses to be evil. Each generation in that family really and deeply fucks up the next. Psychologists will have material to study for decades.</TEXT>
