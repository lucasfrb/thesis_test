    <TITLE>6.0 high ram</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-31 19:30:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Actually a couple of problems since apparently I break everything I touch lately. First, put a new fuel filter on my 2006 6.0 powerstroke(f250) and sheared off the filter on the engine(one on the frame went on just fine). So, tried everything I could think of to get it off and ended up reporting to chisel and hammer which has me left with a half busted cap stuck on the filter housing, a busted brand new filter and to top things off I had a major brainfart to decide removing my high ram would surely make things easier to see and work on. Yes, I'm an idiot lately. Anyway, started loosening one bolt and pop, dang thing breaks off down in there. Anyone know where I can find another bolt? Emailed banks but haven't heard anything back. Also what kind of costs would I be looking at to just have it taken to a shop and have them fix that problem(the bolt being broken off down in there) and getting that fuel filter cap out? Honestly with the luck I'm having I'm too nervous to even do it myself anymore. https://i.imgur.com/5MspLfw.jpg</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-04-13 19:48:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>My grandmother had me in church for as long as I can remember up until I was a young adult. She had been going to this church of about 20 people for most of her 75 years. About 3 years ago she was involved in a car accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down(shes recently regained a little walking ability and takes a few steps). The preacher came to the ICU once 3 years ago and since then no one from the church has visited her or offered to help get her to church. She lives with me, 3 miles away from it. I still believe in God, yet I refuse to set foot in a church again after that though lately I have been debating on going to it and pointing out in my Bible the dates the preachers preached on helping the elderly, widows and the sick....which she is all 3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 75 year old grandmother who lives with me after being paralyzed from the waist down was at home the other day while I was at work. During this time, 2 women and a man from the local JW church came to the house. They handed her some pamphlets, sat on the couch and proceeded to talk to her. They then said "perhaps you're being punished for something". Luckily they were gone by the time I got home. Who the heck says that to someone?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Confused about this debt collector</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-14 22:51:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few days before May 31, 2018 I received a letter from a Convergent Outsourcing in Renton Washington about a Bill Me Later account for $2,657.61. The letter said if I called and made the deal to pay $1195.92 within 60 days they'd consider it paid in full. So I call on the 30th and they say it's now $1328.81 but they'd honor the original agreement. I agreed to pay by debit card and on the 31st they took it out of my account. Now, they had said I'd receive an email and a letter in the mail saying it was paid in full by 5 business days. It is now the 14th and nothing. On the 7th I called and they sent an email showing I authorized the payment but the balance didn't say 0 or paid in full. I just called today and talked to a "Yun Seng" who got extremely hateful with me and said they don't send letters saying its paid(I've never had any debt collector not do that" and said 10 times for me to read the email. I read it to her aloud and she said that wasn't the right letter that I should have received a letter saying it was paid. She was supposedly putting in for that to be sent through email again. Is this normal? Should I be worried they're going to try to act like they never made the agreement to pay the reduced amount and settle it? What are steps I can take here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Worked for Jennmar up until late March. Made around $45k a year, not great but good for a welder here in swva. 2nd and 3rd shift got laid off "temporarily". 2 weeks later so did first shift. We got told on 2 amp;3 that we were now permanently laid off. Then first shift went back for a week before being laid off again. The only people working are the maintenance crew and a few supervisors. I've been looking for other jobs around here and literally the only thing hiring is fast food atm. Walmart even stopped hiring. Not sure what the heck I'm gonna do come July 31st.</TEXT>

It doesn't matter how much money they throw at them, if the demand isn't there you dont need the workers. Republicans are damn dead set on the idea that more money to businesses means more people being hired rather than saying you know what, these people don't have jobs to go back to right now, lets extend the unemployment til January in hopes that things pick up by the new year.</TEXT>

It's actually why I didn't follow my dream of becoming a cop(then going on to being a game warden). Because I knew the cops I'd be working with and knew they were bullies in school and still are. Would he have been fired had he done something more than just say "we need to turn him on his side". Yes. And the damn bystanders filming it would have got him rehired in a heartbeat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here in my county in Virginia it's been a pretty mixed response. There's one fundamental problem here, very limited access to reliable, affordable high speed internet. Crazy that we're in the year 2020 and that's still a problem. The schools did a survey of parents asking what they'd like to see done. From the people I've seen on my social media, it seems like the parents who are currently laid off want to keep their kids home but are worried about the extended unemployment coming to an end. The ones wanting to send them back are, interestingly enough stay at home moms(which doesn't make sense to me but whatever). One of the big problems here is there is NO plan in place for kids at higher risks. My only problem with the way the school did the online classes was there were like 700 links to go to. Would be so much simpler to just make videos of the teacher teaching the lesson like they'd normally do in class. I keep getting responses of "I can't make my kid do the work"...uh yes you can, you're the parent, if ANYONE should make your child do the work it's you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was making $21 an hour as a welder. We got laid off late march(2nd and 3rd shift). 1st shift was able to work two more weeks before they got the boot. A month later they tried bringing 1st shift back, they were laid off again 3 days later. This is the same thing for pretty much all of the factories here in swva. Even northeast Tennessee is facing the same crisis. What's hiring in my area? Well here's a list. Pizza Hut Domino's Valero Guess how much you make at all 3 of those? $8.25 tops.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The one "sit down" restaurant in my town is now open at full capacity again(phase 3 just happened in Virginia). They literally have a billboard up on the way to town saying "we're open, masks optional" yet masks are supposed to be mandatory in Virginia. An acquaintance of mine is a server there. She's constantly posting photos out and about without masks on, but wears one at work....when she isnt taking selfies and posting them from the back with her mask pulled down. This is all a clusterfuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure didn't. Yet my unemployment suddenly stopped here in Virginia 2 weeks ago. Weeks before the extra $600 was supposed to run out. Was also supposed to receive an extra 13 weeks of unemployment. Wanna know how many times I've called the VEC HELPLINE trying to find out what's going on since the 5th? 1987 times. Know how many times I've gotten "all representatives are currently busy assisting other callers, please try your call again later" after wading through 4 menus of automated speech? 1,987 times. I was making a little over $20/hr before coronavirus shut us down late march. My employer hasn't reopened, much like the other factories here in southwestern Virginia. However, here's the thing, if they spent more than the extra $600 helped the economy more AND produced more in taxes. Local employment offices are closed due to governor mandate, yet we're in phase 3 of reopening with restaurants at full capacity and gyms open but employment offices are closed? I've written letters to my representatives, the governor, senators. I seriously question Virginia's unemployment rate as the majority of people I worked with are facing the same thing. Still unemployed, just no longer receiving our benefits. Here's what's hiring currently. Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Valero Pay? $8.25 tops.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I happen to be that friend. Late March making over $20/hr as a welder for Jennmar, a mining equipment company here in southwestern Virginia. Laid off. In July my unemployment suddenly stopped. Did not receive a letter in the mail until July 20th saying I had exhausted my benefits and would need to sign up for PEUC. The same day as the deadline in Virginia. Did that, finally received my back pay and now my bills are caught up but I'm screwed because apparently PEUC only covers up to 50% of what was allotted by Virginia which was 13 weeks. Nowhere here is hiring for more than $8.50/hr part time. I'm likely going to lose everything I own. Thing is, like most rural people, I voted for Trump and other conservatives yet they don't give two shits about us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think much of the distrust comes from living in areas where jobs are usually based around things democrats don't like, mining for instance. Also here in Virginia we always say it's two states. Everything East of Roanoke is a state and everything West is. This is because our governors, who happen to be Democrat, rarely do anything for the southwestern part of the state. Northam even likes to go on twitter talking about how 2/3 of the population lives in Northern Virginia. That's cool, but 1/3 of us still exist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My grandmother, who is 78 years old and confined to a wheelchair for the past 6 years after a guy hit her while speeding in his company truck has voted for every election since she came of the age to be able to. I printed her out a form to fill out and send in to sign up for mail in voting here in Virginia this year because with her age and medical conditions I didn't want her having to go to the polling place, plus since building the new building their "handicapped accessible" ramp is a joke as there's no way to get your wheelchair through the door. To my surprise, her response was she "wasn't voting for either of the sons of bitches this year". She said she's finally fed up with having to choose between two bad candidates and just won't this year. However, she did say that if "there was a candidate worth voting for, hell couldn't stop her from being there". Point is I see so many people, both Democrat and Republican acting like mail in voting is necessary and the only way to vote this year, but I believe the majority will still end up right there at the polling places in person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I wasn't entirely interested in seeing it anyway, $30 on top of the disney+ subscription price is insane. A ticket here is $5.95 for 2D, $6.95 for 3D. Take $1 off those for discount Tuesday. Concession prices aren't even bad and you get a free refill on large popcorn and drinks. We have an amazing sound system at the theater as well. I'm recently single but used to date a girl with 2 kids and could easily go to tbe theater on around the same price if not less. However when you look at $30+subscription price + cost of food and drink at home....it's still cheaper to go to the theater. Sure ours shut back down due to covid but I'll wait for it to reopen or skip Mulan til it hits redbox. Also, I think its important to note its entirely possible to go see a movie as a family and NOT get food and drink....just go out to eat after or go home and eat. That's been the big argument when it comes to people defending the move "its cheaper than going to the theater and paying for concessions".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a millennial I can agree with this. Worked hard to get good credit, to be able to afford some things making a little over $20/hr as a welder. Got laid off, unemployment disappeared suddenly at the beginning of July. Could never get in contact with the employment commission here in Virginia to find out why despite calling over 2000 times in a little over 2 weeks. Finally got a letter in the mail july 20th saying to sign up for peuc...the day of the deadline. Did that, PEUC is apparently about to run out for me as well. The only things hiring in my area are offering $8.50/hr and not even 40 hours AND I have a government that doesn't want to extend unemployment and my fellow Americans think its absurd that I was getting a few hundred extra on unemployment. Its pretty damn depressing.</TEXT>

Anytime someone mentioned that "hey there's a pandemic happening" they were downvoted or told it wouldn't increase spread.

    <TEXT>Here in swva there are several that "require masks", yet they don't actually stop people from going in without masks. Heck Walmart and Food City both took the stance but I've actually seen more customers wearing theirs than I have employees. The few employees I have seen in them are vastly outnumbered by those either not wearing them or wearing them pulled down around their neck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only vaccine I've seen "available" is Russia's and if that makes me an anti-vaxxer to say I wouldn't take a Russian vaccine than so be it. In fact, if being weary of a vaccine that has never been publicly available before means I'm anti-vaxxer something is wrong. When we first got hit with this virus, earliest estimates were sometime next year for a vaccine, now all you see is "we're going to have one well before the end of the year". I'd be much more worried about the anti-masker bullshit.</TEXT>

Personally, I've already made my choice but I understand that some haven't. That's the problem with a mainly 2 party system, your beliefs may not fall in line with either one but you're stuck knowing if you vote third party your vote doesn't mean shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I completely disagree with the conspiracy theories I'm starting to understand at least why some people are skeptical. Personally, I wear a mask at all times and am still social distancing from everyone(granted I was pretty socially distant before coronavirus) however I'll give you an example of why people are skeptical of how bad it really is. Sure, they see the number of deaths here in the US but then they say things like "yet I don't know personally know anyone who has had it, much less died from it". So they haven't witnessed it with their own eyes. Throw in that in my area their are people from pharmacy techs to nurses to even doctors who claim it isn't real or isn't as bad as the media says and it spreads even more doubt. I live in southwestern Virginia, less than 30 minutes from Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia and Kentucky. All I see here constantly is vehicles from those states and people here are constantly going to the beach or to Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge and when they come back and people see they went to hotspots and never caught it, despite not wearing a mask, it makes them even more skeptical. My ex is a pharmacy tech and is dating a guy in a county in Tennessee that is a hotspot. Constantly has her kids in his area, doesn't believe in wearing masks....is perfectly fine. So until people start to actually see it firsthand, they're going to continue to call it a conspiracy theory or be skeptical. It doesn't help that the CDC keeps changing up its guidelines such as now saying people don't need to get tested if they're not showing symptoms. I hate that people think this way as I certainly don't think the entire world has banded together to make one big conspiracy but that's human nature. If it's not happening to them directly, they tend to ignore it.</TEXT>

Ignore it and quit being a friggin crybaby. Just because people made fun of you when you were younger(most of us have been there) doesn't mean everyone is. It actually sounds like you're the type who looks for racism in everything which is easily as big a problem these days as racism. The victim complex really, really has to stop. Stop looking for ways to be offended by someone who is mentally disabled making "hand gestures" or uttering one line that may not even be what you think it is and stop with the "problematic comments" stuff when it comes to her family. No one is ever going to be able to make you 100% happy constantly and if you're going to be offended over things as small as these, you'll always find something to be offended over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While gloves won't keep you from getting gunshot residue on your chest(with an AR) it does negate fingerprints. If he borrowed the gun, it to me at least explains the keeping gloves on. His fingerprints not on the rifle or shell casings and a gun not registered to him makes the possibility of getting away with it much higher. Thing is though the gun is his, its the same gun as in his photos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah, you don't charge someone with that many charges, including the most severe in Wisconsin and not think you have a winnable case. The 2nd guy he killed will get the self defence case, the first one due to limited video and(from reports) that he shot him a total of 5 times will most likely stick. They also(once again from reports) have that the person he called after the first shooting and said he killled someone to was his friend, not the cops, which takes it from police just letting him walk by to him actively walking by them instead of telling them what he just did. My guess? They found something on his pc/cell to help justify their charges.</TEXT>

Everyone they had speak, including himself stepped up to this microphone, their mouths a foot or less from it....and took off or pulled down their masks to address Virginia citizens. We can understand you just fine with the masks on, but for some reason you pull them down when you're in enclosed spaces, less than 6 feet from other people. I kept asking myself all this time why I'd see people pulling their masks down talking to others and now it makes sense, our own "leaders" are doing it so why shouldn't they?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So on the 31st of August I ordered a sticker from a seller, received it on the 3rd. The envelope it was in was fine but when opening it, on the bottom there appeared to be a burn, like a cigarette burn. So I contacted the seller who told me there was no way it could have arrived in Virginia from Miami in that time frame and to check and make sure it was even from them. In the picture I sent them, you see their return address so I go "considering it says from Miami, Florida, yeah". I never heard anything back from them so I asked for advice on here and commenter said that was ridiculous and to file a claim. I did today and the most ridiculous exchange happened. Is this normal for sellers to accuse buyers of damaging products? I don't do a whole lot of etsy shopping but it makes me not wanna do any at all, doesn't matter if it's $ or $300 people don't like receiving defective things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who has been laid off since late March and lives in an area where the only thing hiring pays 3x less than my previous wage, I'd gladly have accepted the $400 extra and an extension til the end of the year. Was the $600 nice? Yes, I could pay my bills and still have a little extra money to spend but $370 a week with Virginia's unemployment and no clue when my PEUC runs out isn't cutting it. I'm grateful to Pelosi for fighting for the $600 but ffs, there are millions of us hoping they'd reach a compromise. Edit: ah downvotes, it's clear to me y'all aren't actually worried about the jobless people right now, the one's losing their homes, their livelihoods. You just don't want any compromise. We have a bipartisan system, neither one of them gives two fucks about us right now either. They just want to blame the other rather than work something out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[VIRGINIA]. Was told I wasn't eligible for EB, so did an initial PUA claim then a rep on live chat said that I would be eligible Friday for EB</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-29 19:32:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm in a bit of a clusterf*** here. My PEUC balance says 0, so I've been calling all day trying to figure out why when I'd apply for EB on gov2go it would say I was ineligible. The best answer I got was to sign up for PUA...right after I did a rep on live chat told me that Friday I should be able to sign up for EB because my account has to update to show I've exhausted benefits. Does this seem right? Will me doing the initial claim for PUA effect that? I unchecked it as soon as she told me that.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-13 00:30:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>We've been friends for quite a while with no form of sexual attraction that I know of between us. Lately however her daughte started referring to me as "chinaman", no clue whatsoever where it comes from but she says it as an insult and laughs about it and the friend does nothing but go "rhylee!" when she says it. It didn't bother me at first but now that it happens anytime she's around me(she brings her kid to the gym) I've got to where I just say I can't go at that time. It reached a breaking point however when she told me her fiance doesn't mind her going with me because he thinks I'm gay(I'm not). I asked her if she told him I'm not and she said, well no. Since then I've just been ignoring her as I've always thought friends were supposed to defend you, she asked why and I told her and now she says I'm being childish. I was bullied relentlessly as a kid, so it stuck with me and I don't have a lot of friends because I don't tolerate being disrespected anymore. How do I reply to her claiming its childish or stupid?</TEXT>
