    <TEXT>I honestly never thought I'd make it to my 30's, hell, I didn't think I'd live to graduate high school. I've been suicidal since elementary school. 20+ years later, the only thing that changed is now I actually know how to do it whereas in elementary, though I tried, those attempts were, well, childish. I cannot imagine another 5+ years of this, let alone 50. PTSD and depression win. I want out. Only thing keeping me here at the moment is my cat. His previous owners dumped him at the shelter after having him for a decade. Who does that? I won't let him be thrown away like that because of me. But he's old, and when he dies, well, what's keeping me here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Childhood sucked. All kinds of abuse. Apparently I shouldn't have talked about killing myself because it "scares people" which is more important than my actually wanting to kill myself. The self injury was "just a phase" the eating disorder "wasn't severe enough" even though a specialist had me hospitalized and said I should have been a lot sooner. I'm an expert at faking being "normal" whatever that is. Or at least not seeming as fucked up as I am. No one has ever taken me seriously anyway. Maybe if they would have I wouldn't be this way. That's neither here nor there though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* #8220;Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.* *When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water* and *sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.* *All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.* *They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.* *You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.* *Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together #8230;. #8221;*  #8212; Author unknown</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Side Effect Question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 18:46:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if this is allowed. I read the rules and didn't see anything stating it wasn't. Anywho, I'm on lithium for suicidality. It's caused me to gain 40 lbs. I'm short, only 5'1, and have a history of anorexia. It's been a mindfuck. I'm currently "obese" by BMI charts, which I know mean nothing but having "obesity" on my medical record is again, a mindfuck. We've tried lowering the dose to see if I could lose some weight, but it didn't work. Any lower and I needed to go back up because I was not coping well. Even when I restrict my intake (hello anorexia) I still don't lose much, if any, weight. So my question is has anyone managed to either lose the weight or just gotten in better shape? Right now I'm all flabby and I used to be known for being fit and in shape. I don't know the person staring back at me in the mirror anymore. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm slowly getting back in to working out. I'm still recovering from pneumonia so it's a very slow process. I definitely miss lifting weights and am so weak it's kind of discouraging. But yes, exercise was definitely what saved my life through undergrad. It was just impossible when the depression was as bad as it was. Side effects do suck. It's not like I can explain it to people when they tell me how fat I've gotten. "Yeah I'm on a medication that helps me not kill myself. Unfortunately it made me gain all this weight. It was either this or I'd be dead, so. . . " I don't think that would go over well with most people LOL</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no one. My family is dead. My extended family I don't really know and certainly wouldn't talk to. I apparently have no real friends. The best I do is post on Facebook that I'm struggling, that I'm being self destructive. Just hoping someone will message me, let me vent, do more than leave a sad face or "hugs." I don't know why I keep posting. It's the same thing every time and just cements the thoughts that no one cares. This lack of support is going to kill me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Care Too Much?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-29 07:47:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think I care about others too much. I have to preface this by saying I don't have many in person friends. When I moved after college I never really made any. So most of my friends are on Facebook from high school, college, work, etc. Now that that's out of the way, if I see someone posting something that says they're struggling, suicidal, lonely, whatever, I'll normally go out of my way to response, message them, make sure they are okay, etc. When I post that I'm struggling, that I've self harmed, or that I don't see a reason to live, I get "hugs," "thinking about you," or the like. No messages asking if I'm okay. The rare times someone messages me and does ask if I'm okay, the moment I say I'm struggling, no details, just having a hard time, the subject gets changed. Do I care too much about other people and wrongly expect the same in return? It really messes with my head and "proves" that no one cares about me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today has been (should have been) a good day for me so far. I got to the gym even though I was exhausted. I went to Walmart and for the first time ever didn't wear long sleeves to cover up self harm scars. I have an interview for a job I applied to. What wrong? I don't have anyone to share these things with. Let me explain. I am basically alone. No family (they're dead) or close friends. Yes, I can share on Facebook, and often do, about these "achievements" but the comments seem so shallow. "Congrats" "Awesome!" Not that I don't appreciate people taking the time to write something encouraging, I do. But I no longer have anyone to share things with on a person level. It's like in school when you study your ass off for a test and you get an "A." Your parents might tell you they're proud of you, but it's a different type of proud than say a friend who didn't see you struggling to understand concepts, rereading the same information over and over again, etc. It's not that shared experience you have with your parents (unless you're in college, live in a dorm, and your roommate relates) I no longer have anyone that I share my life with. Likewise, when things are really bad, I have no one I feel comfortable bothering. No one understands on the deep level that my family did because no one is here seeing me struggle. They just hear about it. I don't know why I'm posting this. It came to mind and, well, I have no one to share it with that I thought might get it. Maybe someone out there can relate in some way.</TEXT>
