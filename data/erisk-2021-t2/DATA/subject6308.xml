    <TEXT>- that we all hate fat people. the only body i hate is my own - skinny sad white teenage girl in an oversized sweater and leggings drinking black coffee, looking sickly but somehow ~aesthetic and beautiful~ - that we call ourselves fat for validation... pls google body dysmorphia thanks - that we do this for attention???? spite????? normies assume we have all sorts of awful motivations when it #8217;s literally about us, not them - emphasising the physical illness, not the mental part. people don #8217;t really acknowledge the mental symptoms</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i #8217;ve always had a fucked up body image (i used to hang around proana sites and wish i was anorexic when i was 10) but the real kicker came when i became severely depressed last year and lost my appetite. the only thing going for me was seeing the number on the scale go down, watching people admire me for my weight loss. the only time i didn #8217;t hate myself was when i felt empty from starving. i felt pretty for the first time in my life. so i didn #8217;t stop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes, my hw was 145lbs/66kg and after a year i #8217;m about 89-90lbs/40kg (5 #8217;3 #8221;/159cm). it took me a year because i live with my family who noticed my eating habits and made me eat + underestimating my calories majorly + i lost the motivation to restrict for some months. (i know i wasn #8217;t obese but i used to be way back and i don #8217;t have a good weight distribution or body fat percentage so i look fatter than i am.) anyway i never plan to recover because going back to my hw? being treated how i was back then, too afraid to look in the mirror, my friends thinking i #8217;m not pretty enough to be seen with them? that #8217;s probably my worst fucking fear. i never want to be normal weight unless i gain muscle mass so i look skinnier than i currently am even if i gained.</TEXT>

          <DATE>2020-07-22 21:45:41</DATE>
          <TEXT>I #8217;m still so angry and upset. I can #8217;t move on. I want some sort of closure or apology even though it was months ago and completely my fault and I don #8217;t deserve an apology at all. I #8217;m just so angry that I was dying and no one cared until I attempted suicide. I was dying anyway. I just didn #8217;t want to prolong the inevitable but no one fucking cared until I attempted. Things are much much better now and I #8217;m somewhat recovered but I #8217;m still so hurt and angry and no one ever fucking apologised to me. Maybe I should be grateful that I learnt that I should only depend on myself or maybe I should understand that no one else could help me but I #8217;m still so fucking angry and I can #8217;t stop. Please does anyone have any advice on moving on? I don #8217;t know what to do I don #8217;t want to be resentful or bitter. For my sake as well as everyone else #8217;s. I love my friends and my boyfriend but I #8217;m just so fucking angry at them all sometimes.</TEXT>
