    <TEXT>Dunno if this is the place to ask, but I've tried Google and got nothing back. For some reason my starting RB and WR get auto benched for the second half of all my matches. They are still number one on the depth chart but no matter what I do they won't play. I've looked into the auto subs and made sure they aren't just being subbed out. Anyone had this before and know how to fix it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Madden 07 'What if Miami signed Brees'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-04 18:28:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've dusted off my old Xbox 360 and got a copy of Madden 07 to do a 'What if' I signed Brees for Miami and cut Culpepper. I also redrafted the entire draft until I caught up with myself. The main changed for the draft were the Saints taking Cutler no Bush. Miami also took Whitner not Allen and the Bills took Allen as Whitner wasn't available. The other loose end I had to tie up was Culpepper. The most QB needy team seemed to be the Bills, so I signed him for them. I then went on to sim the season. Miami needed with a 7-9 record and Brees had a decent year but nothing special. The Super Bowl was the Seahawks against......the Bills. In that game not only did the Bills win, and not only did Culpepper get injured and come back in to win the game but Jason Allen got a pick 6. So Miami might not have gotten Brees but at least Buffalo didn't win the Super Bowl. That is the silver lining I can take from this  #128514; #128514;</TEXT>
