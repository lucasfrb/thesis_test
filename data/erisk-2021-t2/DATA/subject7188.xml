    <TEXT>Yeah, I have relied my mistake, this was one of me and my friends first matches and we though attacks meant it could fire any weapon that amount of times. eg three attacks means I can shoot the gun three times, with three separate d6. So it was my stupidity that won that, but in that game he also killed a squad of plague marines by using a deff dreads Skorcha firing it twice in one turn and scoring 12 hits. so basically I need to learn the rules, and so do all my friends so this helped a lot, thank you.</TEXT>
