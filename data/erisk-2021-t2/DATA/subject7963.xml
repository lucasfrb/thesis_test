    <TITLE>Chromebook Advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-27 10:27:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks - potential first "Chromebooker" here, looking for a little advice. I've been a long time Android user although have switched back to an iPhone for my mobile. I work in IT and currently spend my time on Sharepoint Development / WebDesign type stuff which I picked up a high end MS Surface Pro 6 for in the last month which is great, however I'm looking for a personal device to accompany it which is more likely to be used for Web Browsing, Media, Streaming and perhaps some light graphic (vector drawing) and Photo Editing. I did consider a Surface Go but honestly the Tablet / Touch experience on a W10 device isn't wonderful. Now I'm sure for the sort of lightweight "art/photo" stuff that Android Apps would more than suffice as I had a Samsung Galaxy S3 that did the job in the most part when travelling (its not a proper replacement for a Desktop App but its ok!). I've been considering the Pixelbook although I'd likely end up needing to buy the higher end i7 due to the lack of expandable storage - would it and the ChromeOS/Android Combo be a decent bet for my lighter "personal usage"?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Surface Go</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-27 11:22:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks - looking for some advice, I just bought a Surface Pro 6 (i7/1TB/16GB) as my main PC for the heavier things I tend to do (Photo Editing and some gaming mainly) and love it - works brilliantly and its relatively light/small v my old laptop but it is really my "work" device (I'm a freelance IT engineer/consultant). I'm looking for a "personal" device mainly for Web browsing, email and media - something that I can easily take with me but something that I can keep separate from my work stuff. I've been through a few tablets (iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy S3), I actually bought and returned a new iPad Pro 12.9 as I felt for the price its limited functionality v Windows meant it just wasn't worth the price. I've got my eye on the recently launched Surface Go with the LTE/4G capability but I'm a bit concerned the battery life might be rubbish and also its only available with 128GB/8GB RAM - is that enough? I appreciate there's a MicroSD Card slot but surely none of those cards are fast enough to use for anything but moving data around? Having a secondary W10 device appeals - it would allow me to sync things via OneNote, OneDrive, etc and give me fully featured apps when I've only got the smaller device (albeit more slowly) - also at home it means I can plug it in and use it to stream to my ChromeCast to watch Netflix/Amazon, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks, Ive been trying an i5 Pixelbook but really struggling with Bluetooth issues. I use wireless Keyboard/Mouse along with Headphones but when streaming music it seems that there is massive slowdown when the machine is trying to do anything, also there appears to be interference from and cutting out of the mouse wireless connection at times. Are these just standard ChromeOS Issues it is the PB a lemon?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thinkpad Carbon X1 - Screen Advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-16 09:15:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, looking for some advice, I #8217;ve been looking around trying to choose a new machine that #8217;s powerful, lift and small. I #8217;d initially settled on a Surface Pro 6 but had some screen issues with it, also found the keyboard isn #8217;t ideal for all day use. I #8217;ve been considering the Surface Laptop 2 but I wouldn #8217;t mind the ability to use an external GPU in future if I find I need it. My last business machine was a Lenovo Y580 which was incredible until it broke, and the X1 has always come up when I #8217;ve looked before. I was wondering though, this machine is mainly going to be for work and web browsing with little media consumption as it #8217;s plugged in to external screens at home and I #8217;ve a Surface Go for movies, etc. I #8217;ve read many good things about the HDR screen with the main downside being the reflectiveness of it (something I #8217;d prefer to avoid) Is the non-HDR WQHD decent too? Aside from that I don #8217;t have any other real qualms, the spec looks good and while the one I #8217;m looking at has a smallish SSD it #8217;s peanuts to upgrade it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hades Canyon (NUC8i7HNK) - As a Home Server / Desktop?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-02 17:10:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, Looking for a little advice, its been a long time since I've had a Desktop PC as I've relied on fairly heavyweight laptops in the house for the last few year and an iPad Pro 12.9 for a lot of mobile tasks. I'm a self-employed IT Consultant and do a lot of Sharepoint Development along with basic web design and image editing - for doing that on the move I'm intending on picking up a Windows Surface Pro 6 i5/256GB/8GB RAM because at  #163;900 including the Keyboard/Cover that frankly seems a steal v upgrading to a new iPad Pro 12.9... which is far more limited when it comes to me doing anything with Microsoft Office 365 so it makes sense to move to a Windows Tablet for me. I would however like a more powerful machine in the house that I can use as a media server, for some light gaming (Civilization, Football Manager, type stuff - relatively Graphics lightweight), Photo Editing (Lightroom/Photoshop/Affinity) while also allowing me to log in remotely from my Surface Pro 6 when I'm out and about to leverage the higher processing power if I need it. Reading up on the specs and performance it looks to me like the Hades NUC8i7HNK kit paired with 16GB RAM and a 1TB SSD would more than be able to fulfil that role for me (and very cheaply) v a laptop but wondered if this seems a valid use of the kit?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been wondering this myself really, I work in IT and I really like the Surface Pro devices but I've been struggling to bring myself to spend  #163;2000 on either the 512GB i7/16GB or 1TB i7/16GB versions and I've also been worried that the i7 battery life is likely to be worse than the i5. I'm considering just buying the i5/256GB/8GB RAM (Which is  #163;900 with the keyboard on offer) and spending the  #163;1200 ish saved on an i7 Desktop that I can remote into when I feel I need the extra power (which I doubt will be too often)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The new iPad Pro really is killer performance wise at almost anything, its noticeable quicker than my old 2017 Pro 12.9, even just flicking between apps and web browsing is slicker. It easily handled Civ VI (but then so did my 2017 one) - it will easily multi-task with no issues, I regularly use the picture in picture when I'm browsing on one tab and taking notes on another. To be fair though the hardware probably is overkill now, its the iOS platform thats holding it back now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! It does sound very like what I'm looking to use it for, honestly I have an Xbox One X for high end 4K gaming if I want and will more than likely just replace that when a new one comes along. My PC gaming is very much like you say 4x type games, Strategy (Civilization), Cities: Skylines - things like that which just aren't really available on console the same. I had forgotten than an eGPU would be an option actually when the time came that the build in GPU wasn't enough. I've been considering a Mac Mini (which is far more expensive for a similar/comparable Spec) and looking at Micro-ATX Builds but I'm not sure I can be bothered with that when I can simply order this and slot in a couple of bits to get it up and running!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a Surface Pro 6 and I'm loving it, I bought it to replace an iPad Pro as I was really needing a work device that I could run full-fat software like Adobe, Sharepoint Designer, etc and I'm really enjoying using it. Really nicely built piece of kit, battery is decent, plenty of power and being able to write on the screen is just great. I am however at a point where I do miss my iPad a little, more for what I'd describe as "personal" use, being able to use apps to store TV/Movies offline from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google Play along with media/newspaper apps, etc. While the Surface is good Windows 10 even in tablet mode isn't great for much beyond note taking, drawing and web browsing, and there is very little support for offline media (unless I buy a disc and rip it myself!) For those of you using a Surface Device more for work/productivity - what device do you have for "fun" or personal use?....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Travel Keyboard? for iPad Pro</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Folks, I've pre-ordered a Brydge Keyboard for my iPP 12.9" 3rd gen and as a stop-gap (as the Brydge isn't available until April) rather than pickup the Smart Keyboard I was thinking that theremust be a half-decent "travel" bluetooth keyboard that I could pickup and use with the iPad that might also be compatible with other kit if needed. I don't mind the Smart KB (I used one with my 2nd Gen iPP) but when I've opted for the Brydge I'd rather look for something else. Also I'd expect thats likely to cost less than the  #163;200 Smart Keyboard. Any suggestions?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Constant freezing with Second Screen on NUC8I7HVK</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-26 21:53:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, looking for a little help. I've been running with an NUC8I7HVK since February and its been great for almost everything I use it for - powerful enough at home and great as a powerful Remote Desktop from my Surface Pro 6 when I'm away (now that I've got my VPN/RDP sorted). The main screen thats connected is a Dell 1080P 24" via HDMI and its fine, no issues at all. I also have my 32" LG 4K monitor connected via MiniDisplayPort although its not always on or set to that input (I also use it with my Xbox One). Most of the time when I switch that screen on or switch inputs on it (to the MDP) the entire system freezes and I have to turn it off and on again, it also seems to crash on boot-up a lot of time if that second screen is connected. Is there anything I can try to do to resolve this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had the Pentax K1 and its a great bit of kit, with truly outstanding image quality. AF aside I personally though it was better than the Nikon Kit, I was a long term D800 user before and the addition of In Body Stabilisation and just the way Pentax seem to be able to get the most out of a sensor was telling. I haven't used the K1ii but I understand the AF is improved although still not great v the competition. The D810 is a really nice bit of kit too, AF is better but generally the K1/K1ii has more tech and features built in (GPS, Astrotracer, IBIS, etc). I'm trying to make a similar decision myself - I've previously loved using the Fuji X-Pro 2 and XT2 but ditched them for similar reasons to you, full frame (and in particular an extra 12-14MP on the sensor too) is IQ wise head and shoulders above the Fuji especially for landscaping and city type stuff. It does feel to me though currently that investing a lot in Pentax is a little bit of a risk, there seems to be huge depreciation on kit value (Certainly in the UK) and a lack of any mirrorless options suggests limited future options in the Pentax kit but then we've been in that boat before with Pentax and been proven wrong.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-04 18:19:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>A lot gets said about Apples choice of the 4:3 screen ratio on the iPads. Im wondering how the smaller 10.5 inch screen fares with playing TV and Movie content, does it leave huge black bars at top and bottom? I #8217;ve previously had 12.9 inch pros so it #8217;s never been much of an issue as the screen was so large but looking for a portable, smaller unit for my Media, Reading and browsing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've currently got a Surface Pro 6 for work/productivity and its a great device but its no tablet, its basically an (excellent) laptop with some tablet functionality - the apps are seriously lacking but its powerful, the screen's great and for emulation it supports pretty much anything.  #8203; I picked up an S5e last week (128GB/8GB RAM - 4G) and for what I'm using it for its been great, the screen is fantastic for media, DEX mode is great for having multiple apps on the go, with the keyboard case its fairly productive and again for Emulation it does most things (I mainly like 16 Bit / PS1 era stuff) - its plenty powerful and hasn't struggled with anything I've thrown at it, I'm not really sure what the S5 is going to be able to add (except S-Pen Support) for what I imagine will be a hefty price premium.  #8203; Ideally I'd prefer one device to go with my Windows Desktop at home (and I can remote into that for anything heavyweight I need to do) but as I rely on windows for some work stuff and don't always have a great network connection I can't go Android, ChromeOS or iOS only.  #8203; I might consider adding a Surface Go to my S5e, its pretty much the same size, powerful enough for most things and like I said I can remote in to my desktop if needed, I'd love a ChromeOS Pixelbook or Slate to fill the gap but it seems that the OS isn't there yet - I tried the new 12.9 iPad and while in general its a great machine it (iOS) just makes things a little harder than they need to be at times for it to be a true portable productivity device in my line of work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did consider the S4 and in fact there's an offer on in the UK currently that would have made the LTE 4G and the Keyboard Case cheaper than the 128GB LTE s5e and case that I bought...... however I felt that I'd probably make more use of the 6GB RAM than the s-pen as the Android Apps that use it just aren't on par with the iPad in my experience.  #8203; Also I didn't want to be restricted to just 64GB of onboard storage.  #8203; The Keyboard Case is nice, very like the one I had on an S3 a few years back, a little tricky to switch between a larger device and the the S5e but its nice - would have liked some media keys though!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Chromebook Advice - Potential Purchaser</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-03 11:10:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a long time lurker really having followed ChromeOS but not really felt fully able to move over to it but my recent purchase of a new Android Tablet (S5e) has made me look again at ChromeOS as a possibility for my daily work machine.  #8203; I have a new fairly powerful Desktop PC at home which I've been using in conjunction with a Surface Go or Surface Pro 6 for Remote Desktop when I need access to anything more "stressing" like Photoshop.  #8203; However my experience using the Android Tablet for RDP has been really good too (albeit only on a 10.5" screen) so I'm kind of wondering if I could do most things I want to do on a ChromeBook but possibly more importantly what sort of spec I should be looking at?  #8203; I do a lot of general office type stuff (Docs, Powerpoints, Excel (nothing too fancy), but I also do some web/Sharepoint work, because Sharepoint has generally moved to an Online Model I'm able to do without Sharepoint Designer for most things and can use that via RDP if needed.  #8203; I struggle with Windows at times though due to the lack of Apps, its not a touch friendly OS!  #8203; I've half an eye on the 14" Asus C434, this is around  #163;625 with the M3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (albeit with a Micro SD Slot), the other model has an i5-8200 with 8GB RAM and 128GB Storage but its  #163;830, would the extra performance really be worth the extra  #163;200?  #8203; I'm keen on the size / weight of the C434 which is fairly comparable with my existing Surface Pro 6 by the time you add the keyboard, etc but also quite liked the look of the new Lenovo C630, again its an i5 with 8GB and 128GB but at 15.6" is quite a bit larger and heavier than the C434 (albeit quite a bit cheaper than the i5 Asus at  #163;650)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-04 08:16:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi folks, I'm looking for a little advice. I'm a technical analyst working on an Office 365 deployment across a financial advice business and over the course of the last 6 months or so, so far we've had few issues rolling out the full package including the Desktop Suite (Office 2016  amp; Skype for Business). Last week however we started upgrading one of our recent acquisitions who were already Office 365 Users, we've created new O365 identities for everyone with "our" email domain but for now I only want to use this for SfB (Their email, etc will be migrated in a few weeks and their existing email "@existingdomain" will go) I have a number of users however who are getting an error upon launch of Skype for Business "Can't Sign in to Skype for Business" and it seems to be restricted to certain machines, I confirm that their login works (I can log into the Office Portal), they're fully licensed and I've even been able to use that login to get into SfB on my own Surface Pro.  #8203; We've tried to remove and reinstall SfB and clear the User Cache but to no avail so I wondered if this was something that anyone has come across before?</TEXT>

I #8217;ve previously just used VLC and its ok but I #8217;ve tried a few of the Free Versions of the players that have Pro or Premium versions like nPlayer, Infuse, AvPLayer and Player Extreme.

I like to be able to use a device and having it using a second screen for video, streaming, etc. On Windows or even Android this is relatively straightforward. It appears through testing Infuse, VLC an some of the other media players that it #8217;s impossible to have a video playing on an External Screen (via HDMI) if you don #8217;t then have that  #8220;host #8221; application on the main screen of the iPad; even though it isn #8217;t doing anything but showing a black screen and playback controls..... is there anything that lets you do this? All I want to be able to do is use the ipad to stream to a screen while I browse or work on my iPad... I #8217;ve also tried using a Chromecast Device, the streaming works ok and in VLC I #8217;m able to put it in the background but it cuts out after about 3 minutes and just drops, incredibly frustrating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a look at a couple of Chromebooks in my local retailer - the Lenovo C630 looks nice.- yes its big but plenty of real estate to work off - and doesn #8217;t feel too heavy, the i5 and 8GB of RAM is quite appealing too along with expandable storage via MicroSD Also took a look at the Acer C434, albeit only the 4GB RAM model.- it seems a nice device and a nice size but actually almost felt heavier than the C630 (which I know its not) - perhaps a little  #8220;denser #8221;? Kind of torn really - like the Pixelbook too but I #8217;d really want the i5/256GB model which is  #163;1200 in the UK - not sure I can justify that v  #163;650 for the Lenovo or  #163;600 for the i5 8GB Asus. Looking like between ChromeOS, Android and Linux I could do most of what I want though to a similar level I can on PC/iPad - perhaps with the exception of Photo Editing, Affinity Photo on the iPad is excellent and really there #8217;s only GIMP for Chromebook that looks like it may come close.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-22 19:58:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking at a Chromebook and the Lenovo c630 has caught the eye, nice size for working on with what looks like high spec components for a Chromebook (1080p screen, 8GB RAM and the i5 chip) Just wondering what the battery life on the 1080p model is like? Most of the reviews are for the 4K screen which seems to have poor battery life. Also I assume it has full Linux/Android Support? Finally, are there any issues with Bluetooth? I #8217;ve tried a couple of Pixelbooks before that had dire Bluetooth issues when using more than once device. Looking for this to use partly as I #8217;m looking to develop my coding and web dev skills, Android apps for media, learning and news, and generally to replace my existing Windows laptop, I still have a windows desktop I can remote into if needed. Also does the C630 have GPU support if I wanted to use it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its certainly big for iOS - its amazing how much functionality isn't available on non-desktop sites - I'd never really noticed that much!  #8203; As for the competition - while Windows will likely always have the advantage that there are some applications that just won't ever be iOS apps the desktop browser does take one of the big "pro's" for the Surface Lineup and blow it away, this in conjunction with the already relatively mature app market makes it a much closer battle than before.  #8203; And v ChromeOS - Google really need to decide what ChromeOS is, is it a cheap, web based system for students, schools and those who want to do nothing much but browse or is it more - Android App compatibility is a big plus as with a few exceptions Android and iOS apps aren't that far apart - but again ChromeOS/Android does almost anything a Surface Pro can offer with the exception of those legacy Windows Apps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Picked up a Lenovo C630 at the weekend - man this thing is a beast! Only 1080P but thats probably better for me than 4K as I'd rather the longer battery life.  #8203; I'm running Android Apps and the Linux VM but is there an option with a Chromebook to dual boot Linux and Chrome OS? - would be nice to have linux with full access to everything rather than it running in a container.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Razor Blade Stealth (2019) Query</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-05 08:32:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey be been looking around at ultra books with an eye to wanting a better mobile platform for work v using my current iPad Pro. I basically narrowed it to the Razer Blade Stealth or the Huawei Matebook X Pro but plumped for ordering a Stealth. It turned up looking very nice but with a damaged speaker, I #8217;ve arranged a refund but thought I #8217;d use it for the day and make sure it does what I need it to do (so I can just exchange rather than refund). However I #8217;ve noticed a few things and wondered if it #8217;s just this unit or common to all of them.... 1. Power, neither USB-C port seems to have the ability to provide enough power to a USB-C hub, as soon as I plug in another device (Ethernet,HDMI) power to the hub dies, works fine on an Android tablet and iPad Pro 2. Bluetooth, laggy audio when using Bluetooth headset and another BT device like a mouse, seen this behaviour on other lower powered devices like Android tabs but surely a fairly well specced laptop shouldn #8217;t do this? 3. Battery Life, appreciate that it may take time to  #8220;learn #8221; usage, etc but it #8217;s not exactly heartening to see the estimate battery life at 4 hours when not doing anything intensive of any kind. 4. Fingerprints, this thing is a magnet!!!!! I really like the unit, it #8217;s a nice size and the keyboard is lovely, also think the 1080p screen is perfect on this size of laptop but don #8217;t want to be having to keep swapping to get a good one!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had a similar quandry myself (that and wondering if the 2019 model will ever arrive in the UK). But having played with one now and its closest (it would appear) competition, the Razer Blade Stealth 2019 and the Dell XPS 13 I've ordered the 2018 MXP, even if Microsoft pulled support there's nothing to stop me installing Windows 10 on it myself and there's no way Intel are going to want unpatched CPU's etc out there in the event there was another Spectre type exploit. Having watched reviews its also not clear that the slightly upgraded CPU/GPU in the 2019 model are anything to write home about v the 2018 so I'm happy with my choice!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've used an SP6 for light editing and its been fine but it is slower with larger files, of course it also depends which SP6 your looking at, I previously had an SP4 17 / 16GB and it was great but been using an i5/8GB SP6 which is noticeably more laggy than my home desktop (An Intel NUC Hades Canyon with 32GB of RAM). Personally if it was going to be my main machine I'd look at an Ultrabook with the MX150/250 GPU - not really enough for decent gaming but more than enough for everything else, I've been looking at the Huawei Matebook X Pro and the Razer Blade Stealth - both are at least as portable as the Surface Pro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm tempted by the Matebook X Pro - the specs look good even if its the 2018 model v the 2019 model of the Razer Blade. I bought a Blade Stealth and Returned it - the black almost rubberized coating is a fingerprint magnet and the battery life was poor - I may just order a Matebook as it looks lovely! The NUC is great, I almost bought a Mac Mini then spotted this and I'm glad it did - easily plays almost anything at 1080P if you compromise on settings a little - does anything work wise that I throw at it and with the 32GB of RAM it just flies.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>DBrand Skins - Razer Blade Stealth</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-05 08:22:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been shopping around for an Ultrabook and really had narrowed it to the 2019 Razer Blade Stealth or a 2018 Huawei Matebook X Pro - I ordered the 1080P Stealth with the MX150 but it turned up damaged so it had to go back. The one thing I wasn't keen on was how "fingerprinty" the body was though, and before I decide just to buy the similarly specced Huawei I wondered has anyone applied a DBrand Skin to their Stealth? I've had them before on tablets but never a laptop but thought that a skin on the case and wrist pad areas might help prevent fingerprints!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was using a 12.9" but same conundrum - liked the look of the Brydge and pre-ordered - first one didn't work properly and the second I've not actually used as it took forever to get swapped. I don't really like the Smart Folio Keyboard but you can't argue that its much lighter and more compact to carry with you than the Brydge. I did try the Logitech - its a nice case and good extra keyboard buttons but if like me you also use the iPad in a "non-keyboard" mode its a pain to take it out of the case all the time. I actually miss the old Smart Keyboard that only snapped on to the bottom which meant I could have a separate cover on the back all the time. Someone else mentioned the Logitech K380 - its a great keyboard and not that big, also feels more like a "real" keyboard rather than the flat ASK.</TEXT>

Similarly East Lothian is gorgeous and again within an hour, North Berwick, Gullane all amazing to see.

    <TEXT>Thanks - I've used the Skins before on other devices (MS Surface mainly) and I love the look / quality of them - I think v the Huawei Matebook I'll probably order a 4K Razer Blade Stealth now - reading the benchmarks it does seem like the newer i7-8565U and the slightly more powerful MX150 does seem to make a decent difference. It looks like the 4K screen model battery isn't as good but as long as I was getting 6-7 hours with light use I think I'd be ok with that</TEXT>

The Remarkable is nice too I tried that before the Boox Note Pro but to be clear its "just" a digital note-pad, the Onyx is much more versatile with its Android OS and I found it to be much better for reading and annotating PDF's and eBook formats than the Remarkable myself.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-09 12:51:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Picked up the i5/8GB/128GB Storage version. I've not seen too many folk with the i5 variant of the C434 but I wondered what kind of battery life your seeing? While I am finding the i5 to be a good performer for most things I'm not seeing the day long battery that seems to be quite for the device, I half wondered if the i3 version (8GB RAM) might give me a longer battery with not a huge performance difference (and  #163;200 extra in the pocket)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Boox Max 3 - No light an issue?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-23 10:40:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking for a little advice - I've never been too keen on reading off of an iPad/Tablet - not sure why but it seems to give me eye ache! - I've always been happy reading off a Kindle screen however. I'm going to be doing a bit of studying over the next 12 months with a heavy emphasis on PDF textbook and reading that I'd like to be able to annotate, etc - also I'd like to be able to use the device for general note-taking and reading magazines, papers, etc (again mainly PDF). I quite like the look of the Boox Note Pro but the new Max3 also catches the eye as I feel the larger size would be better for note-taking - I've previously preferred the similar sized iPad Pro (12.9) over the smaller devices. My only qualm is that compared to the Note Pro the Max3 isn't lit - how much of an issue is this? For anytime I think I'd really "need" light I have my Kindle Paperwhite for "leisure" reading.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which Chromebook for Development?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-23 13:36:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks - I recently tried an Asus C434 Chromebook and while I enjoyed the overall ChromeOS experience I had some trouble with the C434 (way short battery life compared to the quoted time!) which led to me returning it. I think I just about convinced myself that I could make do with "just" a Chromebook rather than a Windows based machine - I work in IT as a Technical Analyst / Business Analyst and do a lot of web based stuff (Office 365 / Azure) and I'm keen to spend some time learning coding (Maybe Python) and some more Web Development stuff. I have a decent Windows machine at home that I can remote back into if needed or temporarily use something like Shadow / Azure VM. I know that a ChromeOS - is more than capable of doing some dev work (especially when I'm only learning) - but I was wondering if I might be better off with something a little more powerful than the C434 i3 - the Acer Spin 13 with the i5 CPU is looking a good price and with its 13" screen and stylus looks a decent performer - also the HP X360 13 i3/i5 also looks good with having a faster - not Y series CPU - does it make a difference? I also have a secondary "non-laptop" device for movies and Android (Tab s5e) although I am contemplating upgrading this to either a Tab S6 or a more dedicated e-reader/note-taker (Onyx Boox) but I'm really keen to keep some kind of laptop / 2 in 1 as the Android tablet isn't enough for work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks everyone - I ended up having a play with a Galaxy Tab S6 tonight and the screen on that was "almost" big enough to allow side by side - note taking in one app with the PDF/EPub on the other - but think the cost of the S6 is way beyond what's reasonable. It has made me look more toward the smaller 10.3" Note Pro though - I think that size would be plenty, more portable, basically the same features (with an Android 9 update expected) as well</TEXT>

I think I'll pull the trigger on the i5, 8GB, 128GB) Spin 13 - the only thing I can see thats a close equivalent in power and price is the Lenovo Yoga C630 (i5, 8GB, 128GB Storage) - its about the same price - its seems a nicely built premium device (with the 1080p screen) but I think the sheer extra size puts me off a little - and also while its got a touch screen it doesn't have stylus support!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest if you just want web and media I'd buy the S5e, I've used all 3 (S4 64GB, S5e 128GB and the S6 256GB). Yes the S6 is noticeably faster in normal use, it just "zips" a bit more and its more powerful for gaming but it doesn't sound like that would cause an issue. In addition the S5e is also great for media, browsing and reading, its main downfall is that it doesn't have S-Pen support - but the screen is excellent, the speakers are excellent and frankly I found it quite hard to stress it even though its got somethink like a Snapdragon 670 in it. Remember - the screens on all 3 are the same (aside from HDR10+ on the S6) and the iPad Pro (beating..) 4 speaker setup is also the same on all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It really depends on whether we leave with a "deal" or with" no deal". In a no-deal scenario I'll be staggered if Scotland rejects Independence given a second chance, but it's probably less clear cut if we leave with a deal. Ignore fish, they're a tiny part of the economy and the UK rights owners sold them off to foreign firms years ago. The biggest economic impact (aside from no trade deaIs) is likely to come from losing EU Staff, especially in the Tourism sector</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Emulation on Chromebook?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-01 21:33:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks just wondering what the state of emulation is on ChromeOS given that there's the choice of Android or Linux Apps? Appreciate that for anything pre-N64 (2D stuff like Genesis, SNES, etc) that it shouldn't really matter but what about later things like ReDream (Dreamcast), PS1, Nintendo DS and Dolphin (GameCube, Wii)? are these functional on Chromebook? Also I assume a USB/ bluetooth controller should be fine?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks guys - I tried an Acer C434 a month or so ago but it went back due to a duff battery! However bluetooth did seem much better than a Pixelbook I tried 2 years ago - not too bothered about having to plug in a cable though if needed. I tried the new Samsung Tab S6 which is a lovely bit of kit but for  #163;950 I feel I could spend around  #163;600 on a Chromebook and use another few quid for a cheaper tablet (Huawei probably) which I really just want for watching video. I'm looking probably at one of the Chromebook with the faster i5-8250U chip rather than the lower powered "U" series ones (Yoga C630 or Acer Spin 13) but just wanted to see what experiences were like with this type of kit.</TEXT>

For what its worth when I asked on here most said there wasn't a huge difference between the i3 and i5 - if it was the i5-8250U CPU that in the Acer Spin and the Lenovo C630 there would be a massive performance boost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As already mentioned - don't expect a super tablet - its an outstanding e-reader and note-taker, I had one for a month or so and thought it was great - excellent for reading magazines and papers and textbooks - and the size was just right too - I have been tempted by the Boox Max 3 (13") but I think the lack of a backlight would annoy me. I tried the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 as a potential note-taking replacement (hoping it would be a one-for all device) - its an excellent tablet but the narrow width (its a 16:9 aspect ratio) leaves it lacking for reading and writing. I'm actually about to pull the trigger on another Note Pro for reading and note-taking and a Huawei Mediapad M5 for video and music consumption when I'm on the move!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks - decided to try again with an Acer C434 (i5/8GB model) and to be honest I'm finding that multi-tasking is causing noticeable slowdown from time to time - trying to do a few bits online with Chrome, I've got an Android App playing media (Youtube) and another streaming to my Chromecast. I swithered and swithered between another C434 and one with a "full-fat" i5 CPU (Acer Spin 13 mainly) - am I likely to notice a day to day difference between the two chips? I know the benchmarks show that the i5-8250U is "beefier" but looking for real-life input!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It looks largely like the Surface Pro upgrade is limited mainly to the USB-C upgrade which is very handy, I have a work SP6 and while the battery is great most days (i5/256GB) it would be handy to be able to just plug in USB-C. I've tried a few of the USB-C to Surface Connect cables and had mixed results. In the UK the price saving on the Surface Pro 6's are hard to ignore though, even at the top end, the i7, 512GB device is about  #163;500 off... hard to overlook savings like that just for USB-C. The machines are already more than capable of things like Photoshop/Lightroom with no issues.</TEXT>

I would prefer being able to use more than just USB-C - I'd kind of expected to be able to use a USB-C hub and plug in HDMI/DP but no matter my mobile devices (Galaxy Tab S6 and an Ultrabook) support it fine. Not too bothered about touchscreen but could have been handy I guess. 2. Excellent quality - I've seen a few Chinese non-brand screens (15.6") and this is excellent - 1080p is plenty and the a nice matte display with good clarity. 3. Yes - its not even just the size - the incredibly small weight is incredible - I can fit this in my shoulder bag (which only takes a 13" laptop) and stick my tablet and ultrabook in - I couldn't do that with any of the 15.6" screens I've seen</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Galaxy Tab S6 - Keyboard Issues</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-18 09:11:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks - looking for a little advice. I picked up a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 (LTE/256GB) and its generally been great, however I've noticed over the last few days that it seems to have a sporadic issue with text input via a keyboard - either through a Bluetooth connected device (Logitech K380 or K780) or the Keyboard Book Cover (Standard Samsung via the Pogo Pins). Its almost as if the device is registering that I'm typing the same letter multiple times and it types - so for example I'm typing "Hello" and I end up with hhhhheeellllooooo - I know in the past (years back) that Bluetooth keyboard input on Android was rubbish but its been fine until earlier this week and the non-bluetooth keyboard is doing the same thing - has anyone else had this problem?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I ordered the i7, 512GB, 16GB SP7 to replace an i5 SP6 direct from Microsoft UK and I've had exactly the same problem - I initially thought that somehow the Keyboard was the issue but it wouldn't go away - exact same behaviour your reporting - stuttering movement and freezing. I did a full system reset / restore to try and get it to work to no avail. I've arranged a return with Microsoft and picked up another one in John Lewis tonight, it has no issue at all and frankly seems to fly!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Multiple Entries to a List?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-28 23:46:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi folks looking for a little advice - I'm working to setup an expenses form on our Sharepoint Tenant to allow staff to submit claims and attach receipts for reimbursement. I'm just doing this via a List with a new entry populating and being sent to the relevant approver via Flows. I was wondering though - is there any way of me allowing a person to submit multiple entries in one? For example -lets say "John Smith" is entering a few expenses:  #8203; Expense 1 - Hotel Stay  #163;200 Expense 2 - Flight Cost  #163;250 Expense 3 - Meal and Drinks  #163;30  #8203; Currently for each entry John would need to make 3 entries, including re-populating a lot of his own information (Name, etc) - but it would be more "streamlined" if I could let him make those 3 entries in one - is that possible?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I have been using an Anker 20100mAh Charger - seems to work fine although that 20100 capacity is only 50% of the capacity of the SP battery - seems to be fast enough but this is a 45W powerbank. I'd probably be more likely to charge it with a powerbank when its off or in hibernate in my bag. It certainly charges quicker than my previous SP6 did (via either a USB-C to Surface Connect Cable - or using the standard charger)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A big part of the SNP losses in 2017 (from the frankly nose bleed 2015 results!) was because they didn't campaign hard enough for Independence / Indy Ref 2 and a lot of Yes Voters simply didn't turn out. That's certainly not going to be the case this time around and there's a lot of Labour Voters who are keen on us at least having the option of a Referendum) Without Davidson its really not clear who the Scottish Tories roll out to campaign, the rest of the Scottish politicians really have almost zero profile (or in the case of Mundell and Jack not one that's exactly positive outside their own constituency).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been seeing the same issues with my i7, 16GB. Stuggling to get more than 4 - 4.5 hours of battery with light usage (a few tabs in Edge and some Office Apps open) - everything is up to date and I'm running in battery saver mode. Microsoft Support suggested that I should be seeing closer to 10 hours with that kind of use (in fairness I'd be happy with the 6-7 "real" users are seeing). I don't see how this can't be faulty but the retailer wouldn't just swap it and as its my work device I can't leave it with them for a few days for diagnosis. I might wait for work to calm down and get Microsoft to swap it out via their support service, not happy though the battery should be well better than this.</TEXT>

But that said theres not much else around with a built in battery and touchscreen, I did however swap mine out for a non-touch, non-battery Lenovo Thinkvision M14 as I tend to find if I'm using it for DEX I'm using a keyboard and mouse anyway. The screen on this thing is incredible, sharp and bright and at 14" it's incredibly compact and has a built in stand, I wish it had HDMI capability (USB-C AltDP only) but that's the only trade off for me really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I ended up buying the Samsung Keyboard case, while I think its overpriced it's really handy to have it on the device all the time and the built in stand is really nice! I also have a Logitech K380 which is a really nice and slim portable bluetooth keyboard, I tend to carry that to use with my S6 and work Surface Pro.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pixel Slate Apps / Queries</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-27 14:52:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks, I'm kind of being sucked in by the pricing on the Pixel Slate again,  #163;300 off and a free folio keyboard - I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 at Christmas and as much as I like it I would much prefer a larger screen for note-taking, drawing and general web-browsing, etc - and that Desktop grade Chrome Browser! especially as the i5 / 128GB Slate is actually cheaper than the S6/Keyboard combo... I'm wondering though - about a couple of things that I guess only users can really answer! 1. What the battery life like? I'm used to having an iPad or Android tablet that can last 12-14 hours, but I'm not expecting anything like that with a Slate - I have a Dell XPS 13 which is my work device and usually goes with me too so c10 hours would be grand if thats possible! 2. Media - I know the screen is excellent but what about media apps? I assume that either Android or Linux versions of VLC would be fine for local/network media files (I tend to rip Blu-Rays / DVD's) but is Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc really restricted to using via the Web Browser? 3. Note-Taking - I used to have a Surface Pro but with the new SP7 battery life being dire I swapped back to a traditional (albeit touchscreen) Dell laptop for work - I like to take handwritten notes and with Android I've tended to use either Squid or OneNote - whats pen performance like with the Slate? 4. Gaming/Emulation - truth be told I'm not a massive mobile gamer, preferring my Xbox at home but I do like to be able to take a few things with me when I travel - usually SNES, Mega Drive and N64 games - I know these should work (even android versions) but whats support for a gamepad like?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its nice to see some actual user feedback on the SPX - I've been looking at it as a possible secondary device to live alongside my "standard" Windows Dell XPS 13 - the screen, LTE and cracking design of the thing keep dragging me back to looking, I must have a thing for "unloved" devices as the Pixel Slate is the device I'm really comparing it to and trying to decide between, especially as I don't "need" my secondary device to be Windows based.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm contemplating the Slate myself at the current prices, although I wish it had a micro SD slot for expansion (the i5 128GB is a little tight for me to store movies, etc when travelling) - I picked up the Galaxy Tab S6 just before Christmas and while its a lovely secondary device for reading, browsing and media along with note-taking I just can't help but feel that some of its a little held-back by Android. The Desktop Grade Chrome OS browser on the Slate is excellent and it seems I could cover off all my media needs with either the Linux or Android version of VLC Player along with support for Netflix and Prime in the browser. I'm just not 100% on what the note-taking experience with the pen would be like with the Slate - there seems to be little feedback from folk on that aspect - that's somewhere the S6 excels, its the perfect size to act as a virtual "notepad" and its a nice secondary device to my work Dell XPS 13 I'd have no qualms about Google having "given up" most of the best Chromebooks are 2 in 1's and have a touch/tablet element to them (like the Acer C434 line) its hard to ignore the pricing though -  #163;670 for the i5/128GB device and the Pixel Keyboard is excellent (even though I'd probably prefer the Brydge one!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At this point your probably better just going for SharePoint Online rather than worrying about the On-Prem version as almost everything is gradually going down the route of the online version. A few things from me based on your 4 asks at the end: \- Federated SSO Login from 3rd party providers - **What do you mean by this? 3rd parties logging into SharePoint?** \- The ability to make sub sites or site collections (my free trial version does not have this) - **Both would allow this no problem** \- The ability to lock files from printing and downloading - **This is down to what permissions are given to users, you can lock things down as much as you want to loosen rules up as much as you want** \- Style templates and branding - **This is where Sharepoint Online is a little less flexible, its harder to Brand and Template to quite the same extent as the On-Prem version - that said I've had no complains from Clients with the branding I have been able to introduce for them but be clear Sharepoint Online is not as flexible, the intent is very much for you to use it "out of the box" as much as possible.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks everyone for your thoughts, I've been considering a Chromebook as my personal "daily machine" as I no longer need a Windows Device for everyday (I've got a work one) and for anything I really need Windows for I can remote back into my home desktop as needed. I had been considering picking up a Galaxy Tab S6 but I kind of like the idea of being able to have more "desktop" grade applications (Desktop Browser along with some coding / graphics editing stuff!) alongside the Android Apps. I quite like handwriting notes but I'm not a fan of 2 the 2 in 1 form-factor and prefer to have a smaller device for that (in all honesty I might just pickup a used iPad Air for handwritten notes at this point!) That 4K screen looks awesome for media playback and there's something about it being a "Google" Chromebook that appeals (a bit like the Pixel phones)... I'm probably looking at the 4K, i7, 16GB RAM model as I'd like to use the machine for some coding and Linux Apps although if it wasn't for the 4K screen I'd possibly cope with the 128GB i5 / 16GB RAM model!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Nexdock User (UK)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-28 16:45:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was really keen on the Nexdock after seeing the first few hands-on, I've been a fan of Samsung DEX on tablets but truth be told its better on a screen larger than the 10.5" on the Tab S4/S5e/S6. I picked up a Note 10+ in December and this seemed like a decent match; lucked into finding a brand new one in the UK already on eBay and received it today. Its a lovely device  #8211; the keyboard is decent, the screen looks sharp (and very bright); the only thing I #8217;m not so keen on is the trackpad but personally I much prefer a mouse anyway and carry a Logitech MX Anywhere with me all the time. I can already see little need for me to carry a personal Windows PC with me when I #8217;m travelling for work if I #8217;ve got this for the things I #8217;d be doing. I #8217;m excited to see what else I can do with this; I do have the requirement to access some  #8220;desktop #8221; only apps from time to time so I might look into a low power  #8220;stick PC #8221; or even a Raspberry Pi but with the Note 10+ this thing is really good. I #8217;d probably have liked a touchscreen but its night and day better than trying to work off the 10.5 #8221; tablet screen when travelling; its also a nice replacement for the (excellent) Lenovo Thinkvision M14 USB-C portable screen I used for a few months before Christmas; this is more useful  #8211; builds in a keyboard, trackpad and speakers along with the screen and is compatible with more than just USB-C Thunderbolt! I think I #8217;ll probably still keep my Tab S6 though; its handy having that extra device sometimes and I love handwriting my notes in Squid and OneNote</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks - I decided (after enjoying a standard XPS 13 that I had last year) to spring for the 2 in 1; hopefully allowing me to fulfil my laptop and sketching/note-taking needs. The machine seems to be ok aside from a couple of random reboots but I'm putting that down to having had to do several Windows and Dell updates out of the box. I do however appear to have an incredibly irritating fan issue; one of them (which seems to be on almost all the time no matter what I'm doing) sounds almost like its buzzing rather than just a normal fan noise; its also I'd say a fair bit louder than I'd expect to hear - is this normal??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good to hear that the 4K model also offers good battery life. It seems like the popular Windows Ultrabooks that offer "all day" battery life (10-12 hours) take a massive nosedive as soon as a 4K screen is brought into play. I'd happily take 8-9 hours but would love a 4K screen for movies, etc - the PB Go is actually looking like a it might be a decent choice for me - looking for something that would be fine for browsing, some coding, media and its handy to be able to run a few Android Apps as well. I bought a Nexdock 2 to use DEX mode but if anything its just showed me that really Chrome OS would be a good compromise, Android on its own isn't really sufficient as a desktop experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks, looking for some advice. I work in IT and it's mainly Infrastructure and cloud based stuff with a nod to Microsoft and Office 365. I'm looking to pickup a machine thats really for personal use but that I can also use to help me learn more about coding and development in my spare time, I travel a lot and have a work issued Windows laptop, it's fine for work but locked down to such an extent that I can't do much on it. I tried a Nexdock 2 as a hybrid device but frankly Android on its own is just far too limiting. I quite like the look of the Pixelbook Go as a nice looking hybrid device that would be great for media, run Android apps for a few things as needed but also give me a decent desktop grade experience to get started with learning a bit of coding. I know that in the long run if I get into it that I'd probably be better with something else but as a start would a Chromebook be a good place to get going?</TEXT>

This thing is great; still getting my head around Chrome OS a little but it works well; I was just about to able to get by with Android for most things but the addition of the full Chrome Web Browser and Linux is great. I want to spend some time getting started doing some coding which this seems perfect for! I've basically got the best of both worlds; the Pixelbook Go for when I need a mobile laptop and a Galaxy Tab S6 for when I want to hand-write some notes or just take a smaller device for media playback (not that the Pixelbook is bad for that though!)</TEXT>

I can see that they're all in the Recycle Bin (around 42,000 files) but I'm struggling a little; partly as I'm constant getting errors "cannot restore as it already exists" and now 24 hours later it appears that files are still being deleted.

    <TEXT>I like the Go; its a very well built machine with a great screen and probably the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop; I've the 4K, i7 model and admittedly I didn't pay  #163;1350 for it I got it for less on Ebay (1 month old; unused). I think its Chrome OS that I'm struggling with though - the web browser is outstanding; having used Android with a NexDock its easy to see just how much better a true desktop class browser is with Chrome OS; it also seems to be great for work as I use a lot of Remote Desktop / VDI Citrix type stuff which all works great. I struggle with it as a personal device though; the Android Apps are functional enough for things like Spotify, and other media streaming but I've had real struggles with playing back local files. It also seems to be that Chrome OS is very unstable compared to other OS, I seem to get random crashes and general slowdown but then I do appreciate the the "i7" is a low-powered CPU and not a more powerful laptop grade CPU like in the Acer Spin 13 or upcoming Samsung/Asus devices. I really want to like it and I though the combo of Desktop Chrome, Android Apps and the odd Linux App would suffice; I think if it was  #163;600- #163;700 I'd be willing to compromise but for a device that currently retails for almost the same price as the same specced Surface Laptop 3 (i7, 16GB, 256GB SSD, no Micro SD Expansion) its hard to justify really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It might have been the games I tried, I know that performance can vary massively from one game to the next. I downloaded Dolphin, there are some different versions of it available that run better. I love the idea of a Chromebook, the mix of a Desktop browser with Android Apps for some things and Linux Apps as well. I did try the Pixelbook Go (i7/4k model) and was really pleased with it, I actually discovered that I could do about 95% of what I wanted to do (work and personal) and that 4k screen was just incredible along with 9-10 hour battery life. I returned it to Google though as I just felt  #163;1300 was a little pricey. I am now however really missing the sheer simplicity of it, the light,small form factor and the ease of using some of my common used Android apps which just don't work on a PC. I remain very tempted to pick up another one as my dedicated non-work device that can also enable me to do most of my work if needed!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've used 4x 4K screens in my life, The Pixelbook Go, Dell XPS 13, a 32" LG Monitor and my 55" LG TV.. Personally while I'm always a little skeptical on the need for a 4K screen on a 13" screen (and that goes for the Dell as well) it is nice to have it for Netflix and other streaming. I don't think you'll notice big jump over the 3000x2000 pixel Slate but its a nice screen - its not as bright as the Dell XPS 13 however for a Chromebook its a cracking screen; great colour, very sharp and plenty bright on its own. The only other 4K options are the much larger 15.6" Lenovo Y630 and the new Samsung Chromebook but the battery life on that seems to be very poor, although the screen is awesome, basically a 13" version of a mobile phone screen!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't experienced this with Zoom in particular but I will say I wasn't that impressed with the multi-tasking ability of the i7 CPU; I know its "just" a Y Series but I was pretty disappointed that a  #163;1300 laptop couldn't seem to handle me browsing in Chrome on the device while playing video on an external screen via USB-C/Thunderbolt. I had hoped perhaps that the Asus C436 or Samsung Chromebook would be better (at it seems in raw performance they are) but the battery life just isn't there. I've been using a Surface Laptop 3 which is roughly equal to the top end Pixelbook Go (256GB SSD, 16GB RAM  amp; i7 CPU - albeit an i7U) and 4K screen aside which is missing it is much much more able to multi-task without any slowdown or even audible fan-noise. If Windows 10 can do that I don't understand how a supposedly much lighter OS in Chrome OS can't do the same on less beefy CPU's.</TEXT>

Normally its plugged into my Dell monitor with a USB-C Cable so is powered that way, however with being in lockdown I brought a Surface Dock home so I could get ethernet, etc without a USB-C hub. It constantly spins the fans up though when plugged in, even when the machine is idle, its bizarre - it doesn't do this when charging over USB-C Has anyone else had this issue?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-20 11:48:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Before anyone shouts at me I know that ChromeOS isn't really built for multi-tasking and that the i7 chip in the Pixelbook Go is "just" a Y series; not the more powerful U-grade that tends to be in most mainstream Windows Laptops (and the new Chromebooks). I like to be able to listen to music or have some video on in the background when I'm working; usually whether thats on a Windows Device or anything else I use PiP mode in VLC or have another web browser window open on a second screen. I'm finding that that with the PBG that I'm really struggling to be able to get consistent performance - playing even a 1080p video via VLC player from a local file (On the SSD or connected Drive) alongside some web-browsing (say 8-10 tabs) and maybe with a Android App or two running (Outlook  amp; Reddit) seems to just result in choppy, erratic performance. Is it too much to ask from the "top-end" Pixelbook? for  #163;1300 I'd have expected a little more consistent performance.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;My worry is if we no longer make unified lock down decisions and England opens up earlier than Scotland then there will be a gap not covered by national furlough which will lead to mass unemployment in Scotland. If Sturgeon wants to extend the same lock down longer than England then she needs to extend the same safety net. For example to return to work I need restaurants and hotels to have a decent trade. There's no work for us until people go out again and eat. The reality is that they might need to look at a furlough for certain trades; there seems little danger that pubs, restaurants and hotels are opening until at least August - they need to do something to support those businesses and staff while removing it for other industries or no one will go back to work. A lot of folk won't go back until they're forced.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hades Canyon as a Home Server / Remote VM?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 14:40:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, looking for a little advice on a Home Lab project I'm thinking about. Currently in the house I've got an Intel Nuc Hades Canyon which I use for day to day stuff when I'm home and a Synology 216 NAS which has been great for media storage, using as a VPN Server and being able to access that media and file storage when I'm on the road. More and more (before the Coronavirus lockdown) I've been finding that my work is taking me on the road; generally I've got a corporate Windows Device (Surface Pro) but thats locked down to within an inch of its life and isn't much use for media or anything of my personal stuff I'm doing. I'm looking to beef up my capabilities for me to remote back into at home and get extra storage space as my NAS is almost full! I'd started looking at picking up a heavierweight Synology but I'm actually wondering if utilising my Hades Canyon NUC as a Home Lab might be better? Its more than powerful enough for anything I'd want to do and with 32GB RAM is well specced. I'm looking to be able to do the following: 1. Access Media and Files stored on my own drive remotely via 2. VPN Server for Remote Access back into my Home Network 3. Ability to Run VM's for various OS (Windows 10, Linux, Windows Legacy (XP/7) But I'm not really sure where to start from a software/setup perspective!</TEXT>

That said the build and design is excellent and having 4G/LTE is great - I can't see how its possible that MS will be able to get the Intel powered Surface Pro into the same chassis from a cooling perspective.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-17 14:52:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was lucky enough to be able to test drive a Surface Pro X for a few days last week as I try to decide if I could cope with it as my secondary travel device; I love the design of it; the screen, and connectivity and it seems to be plenty speedy in operation. My understanding is that emulating Win32 software rather than using native ARM apps has battery cost but I wondered how significant is this? The one place I'm struggling is media; the ARM64 version of VLC player (Which is my go to player on Windows, Android, etc) just seemed very poor in comparison to its other versions with it being harder to navigate and no support for other things like streaming to ChromeCast - would using the Win32 version of VLC kill the battery or are there other media options? I think I can fill any "gaps" really with Win32 apps - I managed to get most things working fine in the way that I'd want to (Office, VPN, Remote Desktop, Teams, etc) but there are a few gaps!!</TEXT>

I've an eye out for a tablet thats a decent size; mainly for media and for note-taking (I love Squid) - and I'm drawn to the Slate which is heavily discounted now that most places are trying to clear it out. Aside from the form factor its exactly the same specs as the PBG I already have so I know performance, etc isn't an issue and it seems reading on this subreddit that a lot of the initial issues with it have been resolved anyway. It seems a lot of machine given the i5 version can be had cheaper than some mid-level Android Tablets currently and on paper its probably a better machine than the again more expensive Surface Go 2 (much better battery life, size and screen for one!; well 3!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you really need to sync every SP Site / Document Library? I've very firmly advised staff only to create a "working" folder on their Regional Sharepoint Document Store and only sync that. Syncing all document libraries (From all sites) leaves far too much risk of mass file deletion / accidental editing / movement..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah I see - we do something very similar (Financial Advisors) but we have a site for each Regional Office (North East, Scotland, South West, etc) and then a Clients Folder within that site which individual folders for each client. We tend to have a Team based on an organisational "pod" and then any documents being worked on would be in there. The difference we have is that we only use SP and Teams for "working items", anything that is key and needs to be kept on the client record is kept on a different CRM; we've had a lot of issues interacting between that and Sharepoint in the browser (Its a nightmare for uploading files from SP to another system!).</TEXT>

I'm keeping a close eye on the Surface Go 2 as an accompaniment; will let me fill any "gaps" in my software and also give me a decently sized device for media; reading PDF's and of course hand written notes when I want to as well; so I think the PBG and Go 2 combo might suit me quite nicely!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I picked up a Surface Laptop 3 last year but I've always been a bit disappointed with the battery life; I'm now considering whether a Surface Book 3 might be the ideal combo of laptop and tablet form factor for me but I wondered what sort of battery life I could expect from an average day? I'm not expecting anything miraculous (lie the 9-10 hours from a Chromebook) but a solid 7-8 hours would be nice! Also is there any indications on how long the "tablet" portion lasts on its own?

    <TITLE>Surface Book 3 - 13.5 - Disappointed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-16 11:02:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I decided to push the button on a Surface Book 3 with an eye to having an "all in one" device; especially for the moment where travel and going to the office is out; I don't necessarily "need" a separate tablet. I also thought the "clipboard" functionality would be grand for note-taking and drawing and reading PDF's. I've been a long time Surface Pro and Surface Laptop user for work and always end up carrying a tablet for personal use; why not combine them I thought... I've also been pretty disappointed with the battery life on the Surface Laptop 3 (i7) so having read reviews and feedback on here I expected the SB3 to be able to last me an average work day (7-8 hours ish) So I pulled the trigger on the new SB3, 13.5, i7, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD; its a lovely device - the build is excellent; its not massively bigger/heavier than my Surface Laptop 3 and that keyboard is just awesome; its also nice to see more than one USB port on a device in 2020!! I've been using it as I would normally use the Surface Laptop in an average day; plugged into an external screen; mainly doing some web browsing (Edge Chromium), Office Work, Sharepoint with music in the background and an hour or so of Teams Calls. Firstly - the machine seems to struggle with Teams; more so than the SL3 does for reason; I know Teams is a bit of a resource hog but it seems ludicrous that I'm seeing lag when browsing the web on one screen with Teams on the other. The machine also seems to have a habit of just slowing down for no real reason; I could understand if I was doing something taxing like gaming but I don't think its a heat issue as the fan's not even going. The External GPU just "disappearing" is incredibly irritating; in 2020 I shouldn't need to constantly go into Device Manager to re-scan for the Nvidia Card; that said the gaming performance is impressive (not something I'd really anticipated). The screen undocking is incredibly annoying; about 75% of the time it just doesn't work at all; I press the button it says undocked but its not; the mechanism never moves (it never makes the audible click to unlock). The battery life is incredibly disappointing; for the same workload I'd get 6.5 hours out of the Surface Laptop 3 I seem to be lucky to get 5 out of the SB3 which surely can't be right... On the fence; I do really like the form factor of the device and the concept; its also nice to have the graphics power with the Nvidia GPU so I'm not sure whether to just swap this for one that's hopefully better or just give up, keep the SL3 and buy a tablet!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Microsoft Whiteboard? 3rd Parties</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 15:57:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there; we've been using Teams (as everyone) due to increased home-working as a result of Covid-19. We are a client facing business and have had good success in using Teams for client facing meetings but I tried to use Whiteboard and I get a warning that it can't be used with 3rd parties; is this a Microsoft thing or is it a tenant level restriction that I can change?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey sorry for the delayed reply! - to be honest - the reset has fixed almost all of the issues I had with the laptop : **MS Teams Struggling -** This seems much better; possibly because I'm running on "best performance" while plugged in and using Teams but seems fine now. **Slowdown -** Not seeing any slowdown now its been reset; this thing flies through anything I can throw at it; gaming is nice with the GPU and it seems noticeably more rapid to me than my similar spec work SP7 **Nvidia GPU "disappearing" -** this does still happen from time to time; but only really if I've had the screen off; I only really use the Nvidia GPU for gaming and its an easy fix when it does happen - the GPU has never disappeared during use. **Screen Undocking Issues -** This has been resolved with the system reset; although I am occasionally getting an error saying "another user is logged in" when I try to undock and I know there isn't another user! **Battery Life -** This has really improved; I seem to be able to clear around 8 hours of normal office type use with a little Teams use and some stylus annotating; I'm pretty happy with that for a Windows Device to be honest. Overall I'm pretty pleased; I have been using it for the week and finding the "clipboard" functionality is really handy for my day to day work. It wasn't cheap (although I did get a bit of an education discount) and I have second guessed my purchase a couple of times but ultimately I don't think there's anything else that quite fits the way I work; I could probably just about get away with a 12.9 iPad Pro and the new Magic Keyboard but I'd only be saving about  #163;300 once I add all the extras and truth be told when your using the iPad for more stressful usage (photo editing, graphics, etc) I don't think I'd see a huge battery life difference. Overall though very happy!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Zephyrus G14 - Use as a Dev/Graphic Mobile Machine</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-01 10:49:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there, I'm an IT freelancer who does a fair bit of IT admin, Sharepoint stuff and some development along with a good amount of graphic/photo work and I do like a bit of gaming! I picked up a Microsoft Surface Book 3 (13.5") but I've had a few issues with it and I'm not looking at the possibility of picking up a tablet and laptop combination. I got pointed toward the G14 having not realised how good AMD CPU's have got over the last few years; and I'm wondering how it would stack up for my usage? The G14 looks incredible; the CPU and GPU appear to blow the i7 Surface Book away and the 2070 GPU looks far better than the 1650-Max Q in the SB3 - size and weight is comparable and the QHD screen isn't too far off the SB3 - only big difference is the aspect ratio (I do like the squarer SB3 ratio!). The only real difference is 16GB RAM v 32GB RAM and I'm sure if I upgraded to the 24GB RAM that would do. Is anyone using the device for similar? or has anyone also looked at the SB3?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still think the biggest problem with Android v iPad is the complete lack of apps which take advantage of what are now some really good specs in the top end tablets; the Tab S6 basically runs on the same SnapDragon variant that the Surface Pro X does. Seeing things like Krita come out on Android (probably targetted at Chromebook users) is nice but apps on Android just aren't as as capable as iPad ones for many things like drawing, design and photo editing. I also think that its time Android on tablet (or DEX at the very least) got the full desktop version of Chrome; if it can run on a Chromebook with 4GB of RAM and a horrendous slow ARM chip in a  #163;150 Chromebook it can easily run on an Android tablet with 6GB of RAM and the latest Snapdragon CPU.....</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-14 11:38:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've picked up one of the ByEasy USB-C Hub / Stand devices that seems to have been quite popular among DEX users with the intent of using it for either my Note 10+ or work Surface Go 2 as needed. Has anyone been able to get audio out of the 3.5mm audio jack though? - on the Phone all I ever get is the option for Audio Output via the Phone or Connected TV Device, never 3.5mm and the Windows machine doesn't recognise that there's a 3.5mm output either - I've tried this when a set of speakers is connected. It would be good to know if this one is faulty or if its just a mis-leading advertisement.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>UNRAID Server - Replacement for Hades Canyon NUC?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-23 23:47:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Folks looking for a little assistance. For the last few months I've been using my converted Hades Canyon NUC as an UNRAID Server very successfully - however due to the ongoing working from home I think I'm going to bring that back into use as my Desktop and light gaming machine. I'm running UNRAID with a few Docker Apps (nextcloud, calibre, delugevpn, embyserver and xteve) and a couple of VM's which are doing fairly light work; I'd guess the heaviest load is the embyserver and xteve which are setup with Live TV / EPG and Recording. If I was to swap my Hades Canyon back out and look to pickup something cheaper and lowered powered as my UNRAID unit; what type of unit would be reccomended?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been a long time Galaxy Tab User (Tab 4, 5e and 6) and I #8217;d really like the 12.4 #8221; Galaxy Tab S7+ but unless it comes with the Keyboard case included (or maybe as a pre-order bonus like the S6) I can see this being a hard sell v the iPad Pro - it just doesn #8217;t have enough tablet specific apps and frankly at this point a proper desktop grade version of Chrome Browser is really needed. It #8217;ll be a great Android tablet but it feels like Android #8216;s days are numbered as a tablet OS - Google have never invested enough in it (after the big fanfare many years ago about Tablet apps) and it feels like they #8217;re keener to push ChromeOS tablets now. I #8217;d love one as a gaming device though - that SnapDragon 865+ should be killer for emulation; probably up to GameCube/Wii - that #8217;s one thing I struggle with on an iPad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've tried almost all of the options (Except the Pixel Slate) over the last year or so and it really depends what you want. I liked my Galaxy Tab S6; it was great for media and web browsing and gaming (in particular emulation) Android does suffer from a lack of really good tablet apps though and personally I find the S6 slightly too small for reading and taking notes - purely because of the narrower aspect ratio v the iPad Pro; I'll be keeping a keen eye on the larger 12.4" Tab S7+ thats getting launched tomorrow though! That said I do think the iPad Pro is a better productivity device; more powerful with better tablet specific apps and a web browser that's a proper desktop browser as well; its also worth saying that a used 3rd gen or even 2nd gen iPad Pro is still a very good bit of kit - the 3rd gen is basically the same as the new one aside from a new Camera that nothing seems to use; and the 2nd Gen has the older design but is still very fast!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love Android; aside from a quick dabble with an iPhone for a year I've had Android phones almost since it came out. I like the look of the Tab S7+ if only for the extra screen size; 5G isn't really rolled out wide enough in the UK to care (although the one time I did need to use 5G on my Note 10+ it was fantastic!). I want to see availability for the 256GB/8GB RAM model in the UK and a price before I make a decision though; its already  #163;1000 for the 128GB/6GB model so I can easily see it being  #163;1100 +  #163;200 for the keyboard; I'm not sure I can justify that for an Android Tab given the tablet app support really isn't there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was left disappointed to be honest although that's partly because for some reason the UK is only getting the 128GB Storage / 6GB RAM variants which means any version is going to be a downgrade on the 256GB/8GB RAM that was available for the Tab S6. I was keen on the 12.4" 5G but I'm not paying  #163;1000 +  #163;220 for the keyboard to be left with lower spec than last year (In storage and memory); I could buy the larger model from Germany/France but with Brexit coming up I'm not confident an EU warranty is going to be worth anything come Jan 1st 2021. They seemed to big up the Microsoft integration but I'm struggling to see much that you can't already do if you just use the OneNote, Outlook and To Do App from Microsoft; although the screen casting from a Windows laptop looks decent. The keyboard doesn't look much better than last year although the larger size and trackpad is a nice update; disappointing its not backlit though, they usually soften the blow of the cost (its really expensive for what it is) by including it as a pre-order bonus either for free or very cheap ( #163;50 for the S6) but  #163;220 is too much; I know folk find the iPad Magic Keyboard expensive but that's a proper laptop grade keyboard. Overall disappointing but I think Google have a lot to answer for; they really aren't interested in Android Tablets so Samsung are being left to try and plug the gaps but realistically the developers aren't pushing Tablet Apps on Android because the mass market just doesn't exist. How hard would it be for them to put the Desktop Version of Chrome on Android? Its works on every low grade CPU, low RAM Chromebook under the sun; no-one can really tell me that a 6GB, Snapdragon 865 (hell even an 845) can't run Desktop Chrome?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the biggest problem with App support is actually getting any attention from some of the bigger developer now; especially with the upcoming Apple move to ARM and Microsoft trying to push ARM for Windows; in the medium term firms like Adobe, Serif (Affinity) and the rest are likely to be focusing their energy on ARM; in the long run thats probably good for Android (as Chromebook aside they all run on ARM) but its going to be a struggle to get much extra effort from big devs over the next 12 months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had the same debate and ultimately went for the iPad Pro 2020 (12.9) - for photography there just isn't anything comparable to Affinity Photo on Android; its basically the desktop version of the application but with touch/stylus support; not to mention that Affinity Designer (Vector Graphics) is also incredible although there are some Android apps that do a decent job too. Not to mention Photoshop is now on iPad too although I haven't tried it much yet. Personally the only note-taking app I've really loved on Android is Squid and it is really good but its annoying that you can't sync it with other devices; I also use OneNote and the iPad OS version is much better than the current Android version. That OLED screen will be nice though; I had the 10.5" S6 and for media/video it was incredible. On OS updates; the iPad Air 2 was launched in 2014 and that's getting iOS 14 come its launch in September.... that's just incredible support for any device these days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In fairness comparing the 10.5 #8221; iPad and the S7+ isn #8217;t really the same but here we go.... I #8217;ve had the Galaxy Tab S4, S5e, S6 and the iPad Pro 2018 over the last couple of years, partly because none of them really 100% does exactly what I #8217;d like them to do. Media: Its hard to deny that the Android tablets are better for media, never mind just the OLED screen; its just easier to get formats to work ok on Android and support is there for pretty much everything; I also find Android easier to use with things like Chromecast; and of course there is the OLED screen; I #8217;ve obviously not seen the new 12.4 #8221; screen but the 10.5 #8221; on the S6 was a thing of beauty so no reason to doubt the screen will be good. Speakers - probably a wash - both the iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab #8217;s have a 4x speaker setup that sounds better than most laptops; can #8217;t go wrong with either. Note-Taking: I like the experience of handwriting / note taking although I #8217;m not a fan of the S-Pen at all; I find it too flat and the tip a little loose almost; I use a Staedlter Norris Digital stylus (it looks like a pencil) and its been excellent although you do give up the button the stylus; I personally think the Apple Pencil is better; but on a technical level its close; I suspect its just that there are few Android apps that are truly developed to be as good with the S-Pen as the Samsung Apps are. My go-to for note-taking on Android has always been Squid; its got good features, templates and the writing experience is excellent; however its biggest annoyance is that you can #8217;t sync notes with anything; not even the Squid app on another Android device - you can export to PDF but that #8217;s not always helpful. Beyond that I #8217;ve found most Android note-taking apps a bit meh - OneNote is ok and obviously has the bonus of syncing across a load of devices no matter what platform but the Android app is lacking a v the Desktop version and the iPad Version - we also don #8217;t get MS Whiteboard on Android which is a handy app to have. Samsung Notes I personally find to be light on features and much the same as the Apple Notes app on iPad/iPhone - albeit the syncing to Windows looks a good step. I #8217;ve had most success using a combination of Notability on iPad and OneNote - tending to use OneNote for work stuff and Notability for my own. Battery: Obviously its not out yet but some of the reviews/previews are saying battery life is good 9-10 hours media which is comparable to the iPad Pro and the previous Galaxy Tab S6; I don #8217;t think you #8217;ll have any problems on that front; possible the 5G version could take a hit on battery if using it a lot I guess; I #8217;ve always had LTE/4G version of tablets and never really worried about it though. Gaming This is a tough one - one one side the iPad is clearly getting more attention from some developers as its genuinely powerful enough to run desktop grade games; with ports of things like Civilization 6 and Company of Heroes - Android tends not to get those types of port as its almost impossible to try and support every variant of Android device and system; whereas for iPad its relatively straightforward. That said its unclear if iPad will ever get xCloud which in my experience (testing on Android) has been pretty decent; although the specs of the device your streaming on will have less to do with the performance than the speed of your network connection. For me the big thing Android has that iPad doesn #8217;t is a really good Emulation scene; you can play almost anything up to GameCube on an S6/S7 without too much trouble; you can do it on iPad but its made more difficult by either needing a jailbreak or sideloading which isn #8217;t ideal. It sounds like for class your really thinking of note-taking (handwritten) so your probably not too drawn by the keyboards (Magic Keyboard or the new S7 one) - I honestly struggled with he Tab S6 Keyboard case and since trying the Magic Keyboard I #8217;m not sure I could go back to another tablet one - that said I miss being able to just use the kick-stand part and take the keyboard off when needed! If you #8217;ve got any questions just shout!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've dabbled with iPad Pro and Android over the last few years and here's my suggestions: **Affinity Designer -** Gravit Designer is a decent alternative for Vector Imaging but you've got to remember that iOS Affinity is basically the desktop app - there isn't a full equivalent on Android. **PhotoShop -** Again nothing directly - if its for Photo editing then Lightroom is available and is pretty good but there's nothing of the level of PhotoShop/Affinity Photo; if however your looking for more of an Art type app then Clip Studio looks decent, Infinite Painter has been good and there's also Krita recently released which is free but its needing some work on the UI **Note-Taking -** Squid is my favourite; optimised for the S-Pen, etc although you can't sync it to other devices; beyond that probably OneNote or maybe the updated Samsung Notes? **Lumafusion:** Not a huge amount of experience with video but KineMaster seems to be the best option here; although Adobe Rush is available via the Samsung Galaxy Store if you have a CC subscription To be clear though; having used both ecosystems over the last few years and doing a fair amount of photography work and design (Vector Imaging) the apps available on iPad are better - they get more development, a larger market and in the main are all but desktop grade (Affinity Photo / Designer in particular)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see zero reason why the S6 won't get the same notes experience eventually with an update, the S6 is plenty powerful enough. The only thing that can't be replicated is the lower pen latency with the S7 having that 120Hz screen. I think "hyped" is probably the best word; the S7 notes "experience" isn't really anything special that can't be done with other apps and hardware. NoteShelf is a 3rd party app that you should be able to get via the Play Store and I'd expect that Samsung Notes would be part of a future OS upgrade to the S6</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hardware wise the S7+ looks amazing, I've owned the last few Galaxy Tab devices and that OLED screen is unmatched for video and movies, the speakers are also excellent. I've more recently been using an iPad Pro 12.9 with the magic keyboard for work and found it to be very good though, but the screen isn't as OLED nice! That said there's software for my iPad that just isn't available on Android (I'm really into photography, Affinity photo can't be matched on Android) Emulation is one reason I've been keeping a close eye on the S7+, I think it should be great for up to Gamecube hopefully, I'm just not sure the S7+ can cover off my other tablet needs and I hope the new keyboard is better, the S6 one and the S4/S5e ones before that always felt a bit of an after thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've actually been considering s Chromebook and Tablet combo, sadly we don't get the Samsung Chromebook in the UK so all of our better ones are standard clamshell. Battery aside the Galaxy from all the reviews seems to be excellent but I don't see a fix for it coming, none of the Intel 10th gen CPU's seem to be great with both other Chrome OS devices and Windows suffering from curtailed battery life v 8th gen chip equivalents. Its a more powerful device though, that Chrome Desktop browser alone will do things the S7+ won't be able to and then you've got Linux Desktop apps on offer too. Its a tough choice!! I'd need to pick the Acer C436 in the UK which doesn't have the screen of the Galaxy Chromebook, if that was available here if have it by now!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I couldn #8217;t rely on the Mobile Chrome browser; there #8217;s far too many things that don #8217;t work in it even when you try and force desktop mode; in my experience far more things work as a proper desktop website with the iPad OS Safari browser. Truth be told I don #8217;t think I #8217;d want to rely on either of them as my only computer; unless your requirements are very light your going to end up needing a PC eventually. There is some integration between a Samsung mobile and Tablet; a bit like when you #8217;ve an iPad and iPhone; things like getting messages on your Tablet, etc although personally I #8217;ve been using a Note 10 and iPad and just use the webapps for things like Google Web messaging (SMS from my phone on my iPad) and What #8217;sApp. Emulated games will be better on the S7+; don #8217;t get me wrong performance wise an optimised, well built emulator will work better on iPad Pro the CPU/GPU is just far more powerful; the problem is there aren #8217;t a lot of them because its such a pain to install them but Dolphin Emulator is easily the best GameCube experience I #8217;ve had on any mobile device. That said emulation is exactly the reason I #8217;m keeping an eye on the S7+; if it can emulate Gamecube with decent performance I might switch, you can also install the apps without needing any 3rd party app stores or anything messing around! Interesting debate though; I #8217;m having exactly the same one in my head; currently using a 3rd Gen 12.9 iPP and the Magic Keyboard and having been a Tab S6 user I just can #8217;t see that the S7+ is suddenly going to be better than this IPad for work to be honest; really depends on your usage though.</TEXT>

The Lightroom App is basically the same though as far as I can see on iPad OS and Android and seems to work well; depends what kind of camera files your dealing with though; I #8217;ve never had any issues even with 42mp - 50mp files (Sony A7r3  amp; Nikon D850) on iPad but I have had problems on Android. Personally if photo editing and RAW development was a large part of what I wanted to do; I #8217;d buy the iPad; not only do you get what #8217;s creeping closer to a fully featured Adobe Creative Cloud suite you have have the excellent option of Affinity Photo which is a desktop grade Photoshop replacement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that exam site sounds like potentially a Safari issue; there #8217;s still sites that won #8217;t work perfectly even on a Mac! - I will say in my experience (IT Manager) that we #8217;ve come across a lot more things that won #8217;t work on an Android Chrome browser than iPadOS (we use the iPads for managers). Also to add; when it comes to browser; you mention DEX - DEX mode makes no difference to the web browser on the Android Device; its the same mobile browser that you have in non-DEX mode; I honestly don #8217;t know at this point why Google don #8217;t put Desktop Chrome on Android; I suspect its to protect ChromeOS if I #8217;m honest. I hear you on the external display stuff; I do find that frustrating myself - I #8217;ve been trying that new App (Shiftscreen) that does bring some external display functionality to iPad but its still a bit clunky - works ok though its its mainly web browsing or Office 365 your doing. Also I #8217;d hold off before jumping in thinking Microsoft xCloud is going to be great; in theory the limiting factor for performance on that is going to be internet speed; not hardware specs - I #8217;m an Xbox Ultimate Game Pass Holder on the Xcloud Preview just now and frankly the performance is pretty rubbish compared to other services like Stadia.</TEXT>

I'd recommend Squid for note-taking too; its optimised for the S-Pen, has great templates and can be nicely organised; the downside is that you can't sync with other devices (even another Android phone); you can share the notes as PDF though. I can highly recommend Xodo for PDF reading and annotating; of the apps I've used it has the best reading options (for PDF) and good note tools. I would suggest Pocket if your looking to save links to articles, etc and find them later - it basically take the URL and you can save it offline in the app; you can also add tags and create different pools to categorise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think its fair to say yes and no; broadly the S7+ Can do almost anything the iPad can do and in some ways is even better (Gaming/Emulation support in particular) - but the one thing that does still grate is that even with all the  #8220;desktop #8221; options in Chrome or Samsung Internet Browser its still nowhere near the web experience that the full Desktop Safari browser is on the iPad. I would also say that as much as I #8217;ve not tried it yet (no stock) I don #8217;t believe there #8217;s any way that the  #163;220 S7+ Keyboard will match up to the Magic Keyboard (athough I do like the almost Surface style kickstand) The other thing missing on Android is a proper photo editing suite like Affinity Photo. Broadly though it almost feels like the iPad is better for work and the Tab S7+ for play; that said the new positioning of the webcam so its top and centred when in landscape has been great for Microsoft Teams this week. Its also been handy to have the amount of multi-tasking; even if 3 apps on the 12.4 #8221; screen at one time is really a bit much; I #8217;m not a huge DEX fan though; been having all sorts of issues with apps scaling and getting stuck in stupid sizes which I #8217;ve never experienced in DEX with either the S6 or my Note 10+ so hopefully these will be resolved!</TEXT>

However the same thing happened with the S6; it took a couple of months for the keyboards to be in regular stock in the UK, although I suspect that may have been partly because there was a pre-order offer ( #163;50/half price if I recall). Its a joke that when there's been no such pre-order offer that its not available.

    <TEXT>I think the unfortunate reality we have to face is that Android on tablets is basically dead as far as developers are concerned; it #8217;s only Samsung now doing anything with it to try and bring a more  #8220;tablet #8220; experience to the device. Google aren #8217;t interested and until they are we can #8217;t expect developers to give two hoots about proper support for DEX mode or Android tablets in general leaving us with enlarged mobile apps in a lot of cases. Its also not helped by Huawei no longer having access to Google Services; they have no incentive to do anything else with Android and will likely start to focus on their own OS (I can #8217;t remember what its called!) The reality is that the S7/S7+ or Galaxy Tab line in general is the only top end tablet anywhere near challenging the iPad in power or features and they only make up a tiny % of Global Android tablet sales; there just isn #8217;t the same market for developers to hit with Android and its not helped by it being soo easy to pirate paid apps if you want to. I do tend to agree on influencers but people tend to want to support a  #8220;winner #8221; and its clear at this point Android tablets are never going to win that battle in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Folks, I had a Nexdock 2 back in Feb when I picked one up but sold it on; just picked up another via eBay but its arrived with a trackpad that is off centre - it seems to be sticking up on the left hand side with a small gap between the trackpad the metal case of the Nexdock on the right hand side. Is there any fix for this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trying to see if there #8217;s a workaround for an issue we #8217;re having with Secure Emails. We migrated to Office 365 last year and previously used Symantec Secure Email gateway; however we made the decision to switch to using the Secure Email tools which form part of O365; we are a financial firm and a lot of the info we sent to clients is fairly sensitive. Sending via Secure Email also means they can reply securely with documents, ID, etc and have that peace of mind. Generally clients deal with an Advisor but on this side most of the donkey work gets passed to Admin staff; this presents an issue though - if a client replies to a secure email and it goes back to just the Advisor then only the Advisor can open that email (as its encrypted/secure) - this causes issues where the admin staff can #8216;t access the email or attachments (and also audit/compliance can #8217;t check later). Is the only real way to solve this via a transport rule in the mail flow that removes that protection when the email is received back  #8220;in #8221; to the organisation?</TEXT>

The only options I could see would be dedicated users who setup the meetings (but only really an option if you have a dedicated admin / PA) The other option would be to setup 3 generic O365 accounts (Conference 1, 2, 3) and assign those Audio Conferencing licenses but that seems a bit of a long winded way to do it!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Voice to Text on DEX???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-07 12:07:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've just picked up a Tab S7+ coming over from the iPad Pro 12.9, one of the things I've enjoyed with the iPad is the ability to use Speech to Text to save typing all the time and its really handy as you can trigger it anywhere with a double press of the Control button on the keyboard. Now my dismay when I try and trigger either Samsung Voice or the GBoard speech to text in DEX Mode and it just says "doesn't work in DEX" - this is just crazy - why is DEX soo bloody locked down?? If DEX is meant to be the laptop rivalling, productivity mode then surely being able to use enterprise grade features like this should be allowed. Is there any way to get these working in DEX? Right now I'm staggered at some of the "foibles" which even Apple seem to have figured out around Mouse and Keyboard input on the iPad and they've only supported them properly for all of 6 months!!</TEXT>

Its decent; its very Microsoft Surface Type Cover like; decent key travel though and I'm able to type easily enough; I do wish it was backlit though! I will say though I'm incredibly underwhelmed by the touchpad; I've probably been spoiled as I've been using the iPad Magic Keyboard for a couple of months and the touchpad on that is excellent; Macbook grade - but this one just feels like its all over the place and there's a real lack of touchpad gestures for things like swiping through apps. Its decent is probably my highest praise for it; I like having the kickstand type cover for the back and the keyboard is handy to have with you when you might not want to lug anything else (I've also got a Nexdock 2) but for 220 quid I'm not exactly overwhelmed. I probably felt less overcharged with the 350 quid Magic Keyboard if I'm honest...</TEXT>

I've had it connected via a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter to my Dell Monitor and its been fine latency wise; certainly easily good enough for browsing, productivity and even video playback - I haven't tried gaming though I suppose thats where it might be more noticeable. Personally if I'm at home I tend to have the tablet plugged into DEX via an HDMI cable that way I can effectively use 3 screens: 1: The tablet which on a 12.4" is much more useful! 2: the external screen (my Dell monitor or my NEX Dock) and 3: I can of course cast video, etc wirelessly to my Chromecast which is plugged into another larger screen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to see I'd love to see some proper collaboration between Microsoft and Samsung so far the partnership doesn't appear to have really borne any real fruit beyond what appears to be an incredibly basic synchronisation between Samsung notes and OneNote. Maybe now that Microsoft are using Android on the Surface duo at least they'll focus about more than the Android experience for things like OneNote which are really not on par with even the iPad version</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would spend the money yet; I've been using the service (which officially launches as Beta on Sept 15th) and I wouldn't pay for it yet if I didn't already have Game Pass. Its a limited set of games currently and I personally have found it to be a bit laggy; also its only 720P currently so I'm not sure that would help eyesight wise. I'd spend the case on an Xbox and Screen - which would likely be cheaper or at least on par the cost of the tablet. If they want it for other things though its an easier sell; its the best Android tablet there's ever been.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Microsoft Encrypted Email Issues (for recipients)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-16 19:03:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>The client I'm currently supporting issues a lot of confidential information to clients (Financial Information) and so a lot of mail is issued via the Microsoft Secure Email / Encryption function which mainly results in clients having to login to the secure portal to retrieve the message and reply. The vast majority of clients do not have Office 365 or Microsoft Accounts of any kind but are Gmail, Yahoo, BT Internet, etc - and in general we direct those clients to take the "one time passcode" option to access messages. We are however getting a lot of complaints from clients about being unable to access messages; either because their one-time passcode doesn't work or simply that the email won't open. Where the recipient is a corporate email address I can understand; their IT systems may well have restrictions on what they can and can't access, but for personal email surely it shouldn't be as flaky as this?</TEXT>

I've got a Satechi Travel Charger which plugs into the wall and then has 2x USB-A Ports, an 18W USB-C and 60W USB-C albeit it will only ever out put 75W max. I've also got a 65W RavPower Plug which has a USB-C 3.0 port and a USB-A 3.0 port - that seems to charge the S7+ fine (via fast charging) no matter which cable I use; so I think its just the Satechi that's causing this issue - bizarre.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remember it was different back in the 16 bit era; unlike now where multi-platform games are very much the rage; especially with licensed games (for example Square Enix make The Avengers game which is on PS4, Xbox, PC, etc) In the 16 bit era it wasn't the case; big Disney titles like Aladdin were different games on SNES and Genesis - with Virgin doing the Genesis game (published by Sega) and Capcom doing the SNES one. It was also the case that Sega and Nintendo were battling to get the best games and most prominent brands on the console (even things like Michael Jackson Moonwalker) and Sega manufactured most of the Genesis Carts so why not help out with publishing? This was long, long before firms like Disney really saw the potential money to be made from video gaming and it wasn't really until the mid 00's that Disney properly developed and published games based on their own intellectual property.</TEXT>

That said it would probably have been better if it never happened; but the Saturn was a nightmare to develop for even if they had invested more money into it. The biggest issue at the time was the Sega of America v Japan rivalry with the Japanese arm seemingly insistent that the tech they picked was best (Saturn) If SoA had got their way the Saturn would never have happened and the N64 would have been the Sega 64 which would have been tremendous!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of its rumour and gossip from the time but there was basically a lot of talk at the time that Luca Di Montezemolo had effectively forced him out as part of an internal battle has was having with Jean Todt. Luca wanted Kimi for 2007 and didn't like the "power" Schumacher had at Ferrari (which seems laughable now given the Success Schumacher, Todt and Brawn had brought). He had told Schumacher to make his decision by Monza (retire or have Kimi alongside) and Schumacher apparantly very reluctantly went along with it; Montezemolo had Ferrari press officers handing out a press statement announcing Schumachers retirement as he crossed the line to prevent him from going back on his word to announce it himself after the race. Basically in 2006 Ferrari had taken up an option to sign Kimi; Luca wanted to exercise it (and spend the money they were currently paying Michael on Kimi) which in 2006 would have seemed a good bet considering his youth and speed. There was also talk that Todt/Schumacher wanted Valentino Rossi (who had supposedly also signed a contract option with Ferrari) for 2007; I suspect because Schumacher imagined that fast as Rossi was on two wheels he wouldn't really challenge in F1. The whole thing effectively broke up the Ferrari team that had won so much, Ross Brawn departed at the end of 2006, Todt was appointed as an Adviser (ahead of handing over to Domenicali) and obviously Schumacher did indeed retire until Ross Brawn convinced him to join Mercedes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use Samsung Browser as a workaround for many things but even things like eBay don't work properly. Its very annoying; in almost every technical way the S7+ if effectively as powerful as a decent laptop; and certainly something like the Surface Pro X; there's literally zero reason not to give us Desktop Chrome; especially when it works fine on much lower powered Chromebooks. Personally I've decided to use the S7+ mainly as my personal device; I can't deny that Android has an advantage for things like media, Chromecast and music and I love the larger screen size for note-taking. I'm currently carrying a huge work Windows laptop which is a pain; I've tried Chromebooks in the past and really found them to do 99% of what I need; I'm tempted to try and pick up a used one again and have the Android/Chrome Combo!</TEXT>

The issue with Android on Tablets as it always has been is apps; its getting better but in same areas the S7/S7+ is nowhere near as capable as an iPad or a Windows Device. I hope the S7/S7+ is the shot in the arm to convince Google to actually do more to encourage tablet apps on Android but I'm not hopeful.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Small Form Factor Windows Device?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 16:05:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Has anyone used any of the small GPD Windows machines with their Nexdock? I've got a Touch on the way which I mainly want to use with my Android devices (S7+ mainly) but also as a handy second screen for Chromecast. When I travel though I also need access to Windows Apps occasionally and I've been looking at a small form factor Windows option thats also got a decent amount of power; there doesn't seem to be any up-to date tiny form factor PC like the Compute sticks I initially thought of a Surface Go 2 but having tried the M3 version its a tad underpowered - the new GPD Win Max has an i5 chip with 16GB RAM and looks decently powerful however the small screen isn't something I'd work off - with NEXDock it would be fine though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They haven't given us anything, you would think Sunak is donating his own finds the way folk go on. They're borrowing money and handing it to Scotland, exactly what the Scottish Government would be doing if it had powers to do so. Our tax will be going up to pay for it.</TEXT>
