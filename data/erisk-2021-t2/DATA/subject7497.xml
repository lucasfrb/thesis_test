    <TITLE>Our friend Demogorgon in 3.5e</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-01 16:44:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have just found the 3.5e description and stats of the Flesheater, Demogorgon and it's practically invincible. That leads to my question: Why would someone make his unprepared players fight this monstruosity? (I'm talking about the first chapter of Stranger Things). I mean, they have 552 hp, 50 AC, they can fly and get the same protection as the prismatic wall. It's INSANE! Can a wizard, just using magic missile, defeat this demonic beast? And the most important thing, when Demogorgon die they consume all living creatures in 340 feet so would the group survive if the wizard had killed them?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can the Death Note kill a replicant?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-16 18:53:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well, that's my question. Can the Death Note kill one of the replicants from Blade Runner? I'm not sure because althought they are alive there are a lot of them with the same face and name so would the Note kill all of them or none? Also I have the same question with Kuze from Ghost in the Shell since he has not face nor name. Thank you all for having time to answer!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A theory about what are coins inside the game world.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-15 11:47:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>We have seen that we recieve golden coins for going to the classes and study and we lost them for hanging out with our friends. These coins aren't galleons or any other wizard currency so... What are them? My theory is that the coins are the abstract representation of our free time. We obtain free time by doing our academical chores so we can spend it later hanging out with our frieds or going shopping. What do you think? Does my theory make sense?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>JC should hire Rinmaru and remake Hogwarts Mystery</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-21 22:14:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>For those who don't know, [Rinmaru Games](http://www.rinmarugames.com/) is a web full of dress up games that also has visual novel games (Like Ascension or Cardinal Cross). These visual novels have usually 3 option answers that can be cassified as *kind*, *cunning* or *aggressive* actions, just like the 3 atributes of Hogwarts Mystery. The difference with HM is that choosing one kind of action forges your character personality so a character that uses a lot of aggressive actions will have different dialogues with the NPCs than a cunning one. Also, although the story is basically the same in the three paths, there are different endings depending of your choices so you really feel that your choices matter. Finally, I would like to say that in Ascension 2 and 3 you can not only choose your MC appearance but also the main NPC's style. It would be cool to have the chance to give Rowan a more adventurous or academic style as our story advances. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of Rinmaru's work but i think it would be cool. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I had a cool idea the can implement to the game: Exploration activities</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-11 08:23:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>The idea is give the MC the capability of going into some places of the dark forest (The red cap lair or the spider nest) in order to quest for gold, gems and books. Like sending the MC to **treasure hunting**. It will work as follows: You start the activity and choose one of your friends as in the friendship activities. Then MC, sickleworth and the friend go inside a 3 hours class-like activity inside the chosen dungeon. Imagine things like "inspect this dark corridor", "search for traps" or "take a break in a safe place" where you have to tap s #232;nding energy. Then, at the end of each part you have to perform one of the mini-games, answer a question about the enemies living in the dungeon or **have a duel with a monster inside the dungeon!** (Don't tell me that a duel after spending energy furiously tapping won't be cool). Then, at the end of each mini-event you choose from three rewards as you do usually in class but with an extra probability for **gems, gold and books** rather than attribute experience (Maybe you ccould get one kind of attribute experience depending on which friend you have chosen but the attributes are not relevant here). As you can see this kind of adventure recycles things from other parts of the game and the only hard work is writing some extra dialogues as the code would be basically the same. Well, what do you think? Can we send this to JC as an idea? Would they like (with some expected modifications in order to make it more profitable) it? (You can ask me questions if something doesn't seem clear I would try to explain the idea better).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>From my personal experience, Merula is a heartbreaking character.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-02 09:00:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL, DR: I'm sad because I miss my childhood friend and I understand that some people can rude but a good person in her twisted way.  #8203; What I like about Merula is that she remembers me of a childhood friend that died from leukemia. She was just as rude as her with a similar hairstyle but in raven black colour (I think she never knew what a comb was). I miss her saying to me "Run faster, loser" in the cold winter P.E. classes. At the end of the class, the contrast between my body heat and the cold temperature always made like tiny clouds around me and she was like "That's amazing, that's what I wanted to see". She was strange, a really rude girl on the outside but a secret anime and harry potter fan inside "If you tell someone abuot my collection I will punch you to outer space" told me once, but she always called me a nerd because I had read the Lord of the Rings. The "cool and rich kids" always mocked us so we were like "the resistance" we thought we were very rock and roll. Also we both didn't have "a normal family" with one dad and one mom that loved us so we "sabotaged" the parents festivities any time we could and that's probably a reason everybody hated us. We had some kind of rivalry because neither of us wanted to lose at anything and we were arguing about dumb things all the time but she was the only person I considered a friend at that time. We were a pair of loners trying to understand if we were the weird ones or it it was the other people who was weird. Then the illness hit her and I couldn't do anything else but watch how she transformed, she was like swollen, had lost her wonderful hair and always looked at me with a sad smile. Then all the other people treated her friendly, only then, nobody speaked to us when she was a rude angry girl but when she was weak everybody acted like she was important to them? I don't know why but I was angry with everybody. And the she left me here, alone and without anybody to fight. What I was supposed to do? I still don't know. Then I casually found a game with a character that reminded me of her so it's like I can still fight her and hear her rudeness again from a little collection of pixels inside a mobile screen. It's not exacly phisically like her, but the essence is the same, like a version from an alternate dimension. I can't explain it. What really makes me laugh now is that there are a lot of people romantically interested in a character that looks like her. Maybe she would feel flattered, maybe she would have freak out we will never know. To the Merula lovers I want to say that you better have a good dental insurace because she helped me to lose some teeth (We shared the tooth fairy money after). But the point of all of this is for the ones who say that Merula is a toxic character and a bully. I undertand that you may have bad experiences with bullies (I had some too) but I want to say that for some people (Like my friend and I) being rude is the only way we knew to communicate. Also I want to say sorry to the ones who read all of this but once I started writing I couldn't stop, damn I'm also crying right now. Also English is not my first language and I feel too weird to reat it again and correct the mistakes, now it's your preblem. Maybe I needed to say all this to some random strangers to feel better, I don't know. You can take your revenge and write your long texts in the comments.  #8203; PD: I grew up but I'm still a loser. If you can read this, you must know that I will always be your weird friend. Together against the world.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Fanfiction] A short story about how I imagine my character as an adult</TITLE>

    <TEXT>(Maybe this music can help you to understand what I want to transmit [https://youtu.be/-hncC\_s6XlM?t=49](https://youtu.be/-hncC_s6XlM?t=49) )  #8203; One normal day at St. Mungo's, a man calls for MC. \-Healer, my wife had been cursed! She has turned blue and cold! Can you do something? \-Hmm... I see... What do you think about this, Mr. Copper? Ben Copper looks shocked for a moment and asks: \-Why do you want my opinion? Curses are your speciality. \-Hearing you point the obvious things helps me think. Ben twitches his blonde moustache and begins: \-Well, it looks like an ice curse, and her hand is covered in frost, so I suppose the curse entered from here and extended to all her body. Maybe she drew her wand to defend herself but the aggressor was too quick for her. \-Not bad, Ben. \-Really? \-Yes, if we omit all the wrong things you said. It's obvious that the hand was the entering point, but she was not defending herself with a wand. Look at her fingers! That's not the pose of someone grabbing a wand but something with the shape of an egg. \-So it was the attack of a magical creature? \-That's not probable, this woman wasn't attacked in the wildness but inside a very old house while she was cleaning. Am I wrong? The husband nods nervously. \-Yes, we were cleaning my grandmother house after she passed away last week, how did you know that... \-Look at her shoes and her tunic! The dust patterns indicate that she fell backwards but there are no traces of dirt, branches or leaves so it was inside a dusty building. Also, there is dust in the sleeves, why would she stained there if she wasn't cleaning an old house? But that's not important now, what concern us at this moment is that maybe your grandmother didn't like that you married a muggleborn? \-How did you...? \-The shoes again! Maybe you didn't notice, Ben, because you come from a muggle family but these shoes were laced manually. Usually, kids born in a magical family learn to lace their shoes with a really simple spell that leaves the laces perfectly symmetric. So this woman was a muggleborn cleaning a place where until now there hadn't been any accident and that leaves us with the obvious conclusion: She fell into a trap made by a "pure blood fanatic" to curse muggleborns. \-Hey, it's my grandmother you are talking about! But MC ignores the man. \-Ben, we need 30 inches of silver yarn, tweezers, dittany leaves and kneazle's excrements. \-Kneazle's excrements!? \-Yes, they are useful to trick pureblood recognition enchantments. That may explain a lot of things... Well, the time is running out for this poor woman. Lead us to your grandmother's house, mister. Game's on! We have a curse to break.</TEXT>
