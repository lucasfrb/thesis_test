    <TEXT>Let me start out by saying that this story is absolutely, 100% true. I don #8217;t know if that needs to be said, or if me saying that makes it look like a work of fiction, but I #8217;m not a regular here #8212;I came here from /r/nosleep, and the rule there is that everything is true even if it #8217;s not, so it #8217;s pretty obvious that it #8217;s mostly fiction (doesn't stop me from losing sleep though). So, just in case this sub needs disclaimers as well, I figured I #8217;d put it in there. I #8217;d also like to apologize in advance if the story gets long, but I #8217;m kind of detail-oriented and I also tend to ramble a bit when I talk (I have Aspergers Syndrome, which for those of you who don #8217;t know is a high-functioning form of autism) and I #8217;m writing it as I go along, so again, sorry if it gets long or repetitive. Anyway, obscenely long disclaimer is obscenely long. Let #8217;s begin. I was 16 or 17 when it happened (I can #8217;t remember for sure, even though it was only a couple of years ago). My mom and my stepdad were outlandishly religious and incredibly strict about it, so unless we were dying, we had to go to church. I mean seriously, my mother tried to keep us from going to our choir concerts and band concerts because they happened to interfere with our church nights. The only reason she let us go to them is because they were for a grade and we #8217;d have failed the class if we missed any. Other than that and crippling sicknesses, the only time I remember missing church was when I had a terrible sunburn that got to that itchy healing phase and, no matter how much aloe or lotion I put on it, I couldn't stop constantly rubbing my arms because they itched so much it was literally driving me insane and I couldn't stop crying. And even then, she only let me stay home because she didn't want me to  #8220;cause a scene. #8221; The way our church was set up, it was pretty open. To be a little dirty (I just can #8217;t explain it any better), it looked like an upside-down drawing of a terribly cartoonish penis. The door area was rounded with big glass doors on the right side, big windows on the left, and I can #8217;t recall whether the front was a big window or a big wall. Either way, it was very easy to see outside during the day, but incredibly difficult at night when the lights were on. When the sun went down, however, you could see everything going on inside without so much as a crane of your neck. Almost immediately inside was a hallway to the right which had the bathrooms and the nursery, and at the front was a wall with a set of double-doors on either side, which led into the sanctuary. We had a very small church family. It started out as only two people, then a few more came, and a few more. When my family started going, we had about twenty members total, including the pastor and his family. We expanded a bit, but we still had less than fifty members when we moved into a new, bigger building. The new building was about the average size of a church, but it seemed enormous to us. Our old building was so small, it could be taken apart and reconstructed perfectly inside the sanctuary or the new building with no troubles. I say all this because I think it may be one of the reasons our congregation was so tiny. But because of the size of us and the slow rate we grew at, everybody knew everybody. Even I knew everybody #8217;s names and birthdays, and I am one of the most socially awkward people to ever grace the planet. You remember on the first *Transformers* movie when Megan Fox didn #8217;t know who Shia LaBeouf was even though they #8217;d been in the same school since kindergarten? Yeah, I am Shia LaBeouf. Except for me being a girl and all. But you know what I mean #8212;nobody ever knew who I was, is my point. Anyway, the point of saying all that was to let you know that we were all close and we all knew each other. So when someone new came to our church, you can bet your bananas we all noticed. I think it was on a Sunday in January when one of those guests came to us. My mother was the door greeter so she was standing at the door when he came in. I was sitting on a couch facing away from the front area, rereading *Inkheart* for the umpteenth time. I #8217;ve always loved that book so much. My copy is so worn that the cover is no longer attached, and I have to hold it separately when I #8217;m reading. Even though I reread the same part at least seven times trying to focus that night, I can #8217;t remember what part it was. When I heard a stranger #8217;s voice, concentrating on my favorite book became a nearly impossible task, like filling a bathtub with the plug pulled out. I heard my mother #8217;s voice saying hello to someone and ask their name, and then a male voice I didn #8217;t recognize muttered something that sounded like Nathan. My mom greeted the man warmly and asked him how he found our church or something (you know, the typical visitors greetings) and he said something about driving down to Texas while his wife and kids flew. I thought it was odd that a man would put his family on a plane and then drive himself, but I tried to ignore it. I didn #8217;t know his story, what he #8217;d been through, or what was going on. It wasn #8217;t my place to judge him. (Also, I just wanted to say that the judgmental talk is not because I #8217;m religious, because I #8217;m really not, I always hated church and quit going as soon as I was able. I just truly believe that we shouldn #8217;t be judgmental of everyone else.) My mother gave him a pen and a guest form to fill out, and he took it with him into the bathroom. After a few minutes he came out and, being the socially awkward autism-afflicted teen that I was, I did everything in my power to avoid looking at him until the last second. I caught a small glance as he went into the sanctuary, but all I saw was that he was wearing jeans and an ill-fitting black silky button-down shirt with short sleeves before he rounded the corner and disappeared from view. I noticed one of his arms didn #8217;t appear to work right, as he kept it held stiffly to his side. I didn #8217;t even catch his hair color #8212;I think it was blond or brown, but that #8217;s the most detail I can muster. I can remember exactly what I was wearing, however. A gray cheetah-print top with a bright red scarf. I remember it so clearly, even though I gave the shirt away after that night and never asked my mom to borrow her scarf again. I just don #8217;t wear red scarves anymore. After a few minutes, the five-minute countdown started for service to begin. I marked my place and closed my book, putting it into my purse before I walked into the sanctuary. I went through the doors to find my seat and noticed the man sitting almost in the very back. He was surrounded by people trying to introduce themselves and asking how he #8217;d the place. He said something about coming off the highway as I passed by, and I heard a woman exclaim  #8220;Wow, that #8217;s really out of the way! How awesome that God would lead you all the way here! #8221; And she wasn #8217;t lying #8212;our church was really out of the way. There were some specific twists and turns you had to make in order to get there. That was all I heard before I was too far away, and I took my seat between my sisters on the very front row, where the entire youth group had to sit. A few minutes passed before the service started. The pastor took his place on the platform in the chair next to my uncle, my mom #8217;s brother, who was #8230;I can #8217;t remember his official title, but he was basically the pastor #8217;s right-hand man. The singers started up with one of their songs. Usually I felt a pang of longing every time they got up there #8212;I didn #8217;t like church very much, but I wanted so badly to be up there on the platform singing with them. But I felt none of that on this night. Instead, something simply felt #8230;off. My heart kept pounding and I could feel the back of my neck prickling against my scarf. I #8217;d never had that eerie feeling of being watched before then, so I wasn #8217;t sure what was going on, but I now know that feeling very well and wish I could have placed it back then. As much as I wanted to turn around and see what was making me so uneasy, I kept my eyes on the pastor, afraid to get in trouble for turning around (which the teens at our church got in trouble for a lot). After about an hour and a half, the sermon finally ended and the pastor invited everyone up to the altar to pray. I sighed and stood quickly #8212;I #8217;d been having the urge to empty my bladder since song service ended, but I didn #8217;t want to stand up and walk out while he was speaking, especially since I was so easy to spot. So I waited until the majority of the church was standing, or at least singing, so I could make it out without anybody noticing me. Big mistake. I went into the restroom to see that there were a few other women in there. I locked myself into the middle stall (we only had three) to do my business. Before I finished, everyone except for one other girl had all left. I heard the door open and then a man #8217;s voice said  #8220;Oops, sorry, wrong restroom #8221; or something along those lines, and then the door closed again. I didn #8217;t recognize the voice, but because of that I was able to place it as the visitor. I didn #8217;t know why, but for some reason I found it extremely odd that he walked into the wrong restroom. There were signs on both doors depicting which gender the bathroom was for. They were a bit faded, sure, but they were the signs that looked like stick figures wearing either pants or dresses. I thought they were easy enough to tell apart, but I figured maybe they were faded to the point that it was hard to tell. I still couldn #8217;t shake that feeling, though. I heard the other woman making some sort of flustered noise, and then the water turned on. She must have been fixing her clothes or her hair in the mirror when the man opened the door. I heard my uncle #8217;s voice outside the door asking someone what was wrong, and the stranger #8217;s voice came again, saying something about a stomachache.  #8220;Well, that #8217;s not good, #8221; my uncle replied, sounding genuinely concerned.  #8220;I hope you get to feeling better, man. God bless. #8221; And then I heard his footsteps walking away. A minute later, the woman finished whatever she was doing and walked out. And I was alone. I finally finished up, but I couldn #8217;t shake that eerie feeling. I exited the stall and washed my hands, but as I put my hand on the door handle to pull it open, my senses started shrieking at me to stay where I was. I froze for a second, trying to calm down, but over the pounding of my heart in my ears, I heard a rustle outside. I stepped back, thinking some woman was coming in and not wanting to be in her way, but all I heard was that strange sound, like silk rubbing against skin. My heart sped up as the noise continued, so I moved further away. I tried to calm myself down, knowing I was being irrational, but the strange panic was pushing my heart up into my throat. Without really knowing why, I walked even further away from the door and stepped sideways into the stall furthest away from it. I shut the door quietly and locked it without a sound. Then, because I was still feeling so irrationally afraid, I untied the red scarf that was around my neck and threw it over the partition into the stall next to me, the one I had been in previously. As I stood in the stall trying to calm myself, breathing heavily for what seemed like an hour, I heard the bathroom door creak open. My fear took hold of me and I wedged myself between the toilet and the wall before I even realized what I was doing, trying hard not to make a sound. My heels made a tiny click against the floor and I cursed myself, slipping my feet out of them and standing on my tiptoes behind them. My heartbeat came back into my ears, pounding like a hammer against my flesh like it was trying to burst out through my head. I had positioned myself so that even if someone looked underneath the walls of the stalls, they wouldn #8217;t be able to see me unless they were right in front of my door. It was completely silent for a few moments, and then I heard a heavy footstep on the tile. My heartbeat stopped completely. There was no click of heels, no soft double pat of a flat. Just one solid footstep. No woman in our entire church walked like that. Out of nowhere, my uncle #8217;s voice boomed out.  #8220;Hey! What are you doing? #8221; The door banged shut and I heard the stranger #8217;s voice stuttering out an apology.  #8220;S-sory, man, I didn #8217;t r-realize this was the wrong-g bathroom. #8221;  #8220;I think you need to leave, #8221; my uncle practically growled. Now let me tell you something about my uncle. He is not a mean person. In fact, he has the biggest, softest heart of anyone I know. He #8217;s my favorite uncle for a reason. But, while not being muscular, he is a big man, at least to me, and I stand at a proud 5 #8217;8 #8221;. He #8217;s at least a foot taller than me, and 3 times as wide (and I #8217;m also not a skinny girl). And he wasn #8217;t buying this stranger #8217;s bullshit at all. Both voices came again, muffled so I couldn #8217;t hear what they were saying. I heard two sets of footsteps, one much more solid than the other, and then the front door quickly opened and slowly swung shut. I stood frozen in my spot, trying to remember how to exhale without screaming. A few tears leaked out of my eyes as I realized the strange man had been the one opening the bathroom door and trying to come in. A set of high-heeled steps came from outside, and my uncle #8217;s big voice came again.  #8220;Monica, go see if there #8217;s anyone in there. #8221; Monica was his daughter, one of my cousins. The door opened yet again and I heard Monica #8217;s heels clicking against the tile. By now, my leaking tears had turned into soft sobs of terror as I started trying to keep my body from freaking out. I was slowly coming to the realization of what had just happened.  #8220;Hello? #8221; I heard Monica #8217;s voice ringing out in the bathroom, sounding almost authoritative.  #8220;Is anybody in here? #8221; I unlocked my door, hoping that my mind wasn #8217;t just playing tricks on me, and slowly opened it up. I peeked my head out and saw that it really was Monica. She gasped at my now tear-streaked face.  #8220;Ashlynn? #8221;  #8220;Is that man gone? #8221; I tried to ask her, but it came out quiet and squeaky and shaky. Somehow Monica understood the gravity of the situation despite not knowing what was going on or what had happened as she didn #8217;t come by until the guy had already gone. She put her arm around my shoulders and gently led me out of the restroom. I saw her eyeing my feet and I knew she had noticed my missing shoes, but she didn #8217;t say a word about it. My uncle was standing in the hallway, and his eyes when they fell on me were sad, angry, and shocked.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221; he asked me.  #8220;Is that man gone? #8221; I repeated to him, trying to make myself more understandable. It barely sounded any different, but somehow he got the message.  #8220;He #8217;s gone, #8221; he assured me, glaring at the front door.  #8220;I walked him out and watched him drive off. #8221; He paused, then said quietly,  #8220;His license plates were from Louisiana. #8221; I won #8217;t tell you what state I was in at the time, but it was definitely not Arkansas. My uncle noticed me shaking and took off his suit jacket, wrapping it around my shoulders like a blanket.  #8220;Here, go back inside and sit next to your mom, #8221; he instructed me. I did as he asked, not even asking why he was staying up front. Monica stood guard over me as she walked me inside and up to the front, where my mother was sitting with my two sisters. I told my family the general story of what had happened, but they laughed it off, saying the creep must have wanted a peep. A few minutes later, however, my uncle came back inside to talk to the pastor, and their laughter ceased. Our pastor stood in front of everyone, looking incredibly somber. He proceeded to tell the congregation about his side of what had happened to  #8220;one of our young girls, #8221; as he put it, and what he told us chilled me to the bone. Apparently, the guy had been watching me ever since the service had started, occasionally fiddling with something in his pocket. His eyes had not left the back of my head one single time. Then, when altar call started and I went into the restroom, he had watched me leave, looked around as if making sure nobody was watching him, then stood and followed me out. My pastor told my uncle that the man had followed  #8220;one of our youth #8221; outside towards the bathrooms and instructed him to go see what was up with the man, so my uncle went to talk to the stranger, which must have been when the stomachache talk took place. My uncle came back in to report to our pastor. After hearing about it, my pastor looked through a small window in the door to see that the man had not gone into the men #8217;s restroom, but was instead walking around outside. He told my uncle to stand by the doors and immediately go back out if he saw a signal. Sure enough, towards the end of altar call, he saw the guy take off down the hall towards the ladies #8217; room and started pointing frantically. My uncle shot through the doors to find the man standing in the doorway, holding the door open and looking into the bathroom with a perplexed expression on his face as he drew something slowly out of his pocket. He had just barely begun to walk in when my uncle shouted at him. He dropped what he had been holding and spun around, but not before my uncle caught a glimpse of the black handle of a rather large folded pocket knife. After he told his tale and reminded everyone that there is evil out there, my mom and sisters started apologizing to me. The rest of the church realized my uncle was missing his jacket and, after seeing me wearing a men #8217;s suit jacket that was much too big for me, they put two and two together despite the pastor #8217;s attempt to keep my anonymous. We were formally dismissed and instead of hanging out and chatting for an hour or two like she usually did, my mother quickly ushered my and my sisters out to the car. As we passed by the bathrooms I looked down the hall, seeing the girls bathroom right at the end, and suddenly it hit me so hard that my legs went weak for a second. I realized why I had found it so odd that the man would go into the wrong restroom. The first thing he had done when he first got there was use the men #8217;s restroom. I am now 19 years old, living in an apartment with my boyfriend and his cousin #8217;s family. I don #8217;t know why that man decided to target me out of all the other girls there. I wasn #8217;t the prettiest, not by a long shot. None of us were allowed to wear makeup or jewelry or short skirts, so I knew I couldn #8217;t have looked very attractive. The only skinny girl there was my 15-year-old sister. Maybe he just liked blondes, I guess, as everyone else there was a brunette. Or maybe it was my loud red scarf that caught his attention. Or maybe he was even a stalker or something. Either way, there is no doubt in my mind about what he wanted that night. I feel almost certain fro the way everything was set up #8212;he was planning to kidnap and rape me, and possibly kill me. So, all that being said, please, mister silk shirt, let #8217;s not ever officially meet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a friend who was asking me to draw her a tattoo, but as it turns out, I'm terrible at insects. And bones. She wants a dragonfly with a spine in place of the body, and some bones in the wings. Also, I don't know if this is worth mentioning, she's black, but has light skin, particularly on her wrist. I don't know if this will affect color at all, but she wants some blue/green/purple in it as well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's wrong with Jesus Camp?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-20 00:49:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I just watched the famous documentary Jesus Camp after seeing it in tons of "disturbing films" lists and threads, and I was just wondering what it is about it that makes it so scary to everyone? I don't mean "It's about God so it's fine and you're all heathens" but honestly, people are calling it disturbing, saying it's child abuse and it's the scariest film they've ever seen. What about it makes it so bad? And for the record, I don't agree with it or anything. I'm not even a Christian. But from the time I was 8 until I was almost 19, with a small break in the middle, I was raised this way. Worse, in fact--according to my parents, those people are going to hell because the girls wear pants and cut their hair, and the boys are wearing shorts and not cutting their hair short. I think I may have perhaps been brainwashed a bit too well or something, so I'm legitimately asking. How does this film show anything scary or depict child abuse?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-03-22 22:54:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seriously, this isn't 4chan. I've been seeing people call other people "autistic" way too much lately. I've already shut that shit down about three times recently, and that's only when I decide to step in instead of just letting the downvotes speak for themselves. Nobody knows what autism is. Like I just told some moron in the comments section of some post, it's no more of an insult than "diabetic" is. It's a condition that people have that makes then different. It's not a cute little thing you can call someone when you don't agree with them. Sorry, I had to rant about that for a second. I've been seeing it way too much, and it's absolute garbage. Edit: I feel the need to clarify that this isn't directed at this sub. I just figured it would fit here, and couldn't think of anywhere else that would let me post a small rant without a lot of witty lines.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't had very many symptoms yet (I am only 5 weeks along), but the nausea has been out of control. I was prescribed Zofran to help with it, but it cost $170 (!) to fill the prescription, which we didn't have. We found a goodrx coupon that should have knocked the price down to $20, but after buying prenatals and filling a prescription for a UTI medication, we don't have that much extra either. How else can I get past the nausea?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you really have to exercise during the first trimester?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-25 17:11:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, this is probably an extremely obvious question, but I don't know the answer and I don't have a doctor to consult yet, so I have to ask you for now. Yesterday I was sitting on the couch with my SO, eating a couple of small bean burritos for dinner (I really can't handle very much food right now due to nausea). His uncle, who loves telling me about how I'm doing everything wrong, decided to sit next to me and say, very bluntly, that "if you don't start getting more exercise, you're going to kill your baby." But I read all the time that women who are high-risk actually have to be put on bedrest fairly often. I'll admit, I'm not very active--I spend most of my time lying down, especially now that I'm sick all the time. I can hardly eat, and I may just be misinformed, but I really feel like I shouldn't be expending the little bit of energy I manage to get. Am I wrong? Is SO's uncle right? Don't be afraid to tell me if he is, I need to know what to do. This baby took its time getting here and I don't want to lose it, especially if I could have prevented it. Also, if you have any ideas on how I could get some exercise without killing myself, besides going outside (it's hot out here in South Texas), please share. Edit: I don't know if this matters or not, but I felt I should add that I'm not even overweight. I'm at the top of the healthy weight range for my age and height. And before becoming pregnant, I literally laid around when I wasn't cleaning my room or taking care of my cats and dog, which didn't start until I got pregnant anyway, so I already do more than I used to. It's hard when you're tired and sick all the time, but I am trying, and I'm hydrating and everything.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-05-31 18:15:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't even know how my life got to this point, but I'm having the worst time. Sometime in November or December, my SO was arrested for an old false rape charge against him which was dismissed and is now being brought back up. We bailed him out, but now he's on some sort of probation, so he has to keep paying them while they continually reset his court date because they can't find anything to use against him but they're desperate to stick this on him somehow. My dad just went to jail today, too. I don't even remember why, something about money he didn't have. And these aren't even the worst things happening to me right now. SO and I have been living with his uncle, who was ok until recently. He was supposed to go to jail too, but he got reset and now has another month and a half of freedom. They also cut off the alcohol monitor thing on his ankle, so he's become an alcoholic again. A few days ago, he came into my room and screamed at me because I didn't clean the windowsill properly. Somehow it escalated to him continually calling me and my dad pieces of shit, saying I don't deserve my SO and he's too good for me, and eventually he pulled out a knife and said he'd kill me, SO, and my entire family. Obviously I couldn't stay there, and my dad wasn't in any position to take me in, so I called my mom, who lived in the state just north of us, and asked if she could come pick me up. My SO was upset and said that if I left him, it would be the end of our relationship. He also mentioned having no reason to live without me, and the poor guy has bipolar and severe depression. I had to talk with him forever to get him to realize how serious this situation with his uncle was, and that leaving was the best thing for me and for our baby. Finally, he said he'd let me go, but he looked so defeated. Due to this stupid charge against him, he can't leave that house until it's dismissed, so he couldn't come with me. So now I'm in a different state, without my SO, can't talk to my dad, and on top of it all, my mom is super religious and said I can't stay with her because I don't follow her religion, so I have to go move in with my grandma who's known to be a pain. All this, and I'm 7 weeks, so my morning sickness has been getting worse, I can't stand for longer than a minute without something hurting, and I'm still struggling to get insurance, let alone to get an ID, so I haven't even been able to schedule a doctor's visit (which, speaking of, the doctor I was supposed to go see is in my old state, where I no longer am, so I have no idea who I'll even be seeing). And it sucks to see my younger sisters having jobs and getting their lives so together, and here I am, lying on my mother's couch because I can't manage to do anything right at 21 years old. You don't have to give me any advice, or any support, or even read this at all. I just needed to get it all out there somewhere. Even just writing it down was more helpful than sitting here thinking about it. Oh, and I had to leave my cat with him, so I'm just hoping she'll be alright. Now she's all he has to get him through his court date, our anniversary, and his first Father's Day. I won't be there for any of it</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there a subreddit or something for formula feeding?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-16 02:36:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm 3 days postpartum, and I've made the decision to switch to formula feeding. Maybe I could have held out if I really really tried. I thought it would be easier than it was, especially since I did so well during birth. But it just wasn't working out for me or my daughter. It's eating away at my sanity, and it's so incredibly painful. I'd rather give birth again than feed her one more time. Even my mom has noticed that I'm doing great in most areas of being a new mom, but when it's time to feed her, I put it off as much as I can. I've started to resent my baby for needing me so much just to eat. My baby has very strong jaws--all the nurses commented on how strong her suction was. The first one made the remark that she sucked like a two-month-old, and all the others agreed when we told them. I also got comments on how bruised and chapped my nipples were, even after only a day. Even with the nurses helping me, I just couldn't get any of the holds down, and Rosalie wasn't doing very well. I've wanted so badly to make it work, but my main reason has nothing to do with immunity, or convenience, or bonding. The main reason is because I'm worried about the cost. I don't know how I'm going to afford diapers and wipes, let alone formula. I will be applying for WIC as soon as I can. Anyway, sorry for that, I just had to vent for a second. It's so hard to feel like I'm failing my baby, even though all I ever do is stand up for other women who have had to make this same decision. But my problem now is that I don't know anything about formula. I don't know what kind to get, or what kind WIC will give me. I don't know anything about bottles, and I only have a couple that I got as freebies. I don't know if it's ok to give her a pacifier now. I just don't know anything. I was just wondering if maybe there was a subreddit for it, or if someone could please give me a few tips, I would really appreciate it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New formula feeder here. Any starter tips?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-16 05:51:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, guys. I just made a post on BabyBumps about my decision to switch my 3-day-old daughter from breast to formula. I won't go into detail again, but breastfeeding just wasn't working out for me--I'd rather go into labor and give birth to my daughter all over again, than nurse her one more time. So here I am. The problem is, I don't know anything about formula feeding. What formula should I use? What brand does Oklahoma WIC even give you? Does it matter if I switch brands a lot? Will WIC give me enough to keep my baby fed, or am I still looking at extra cost? What about bottles? I have one bottle I was given as a freebie right now, I believe the brand is MAM and my daughter seems to like it. Has anyone used these bottles? I've never even heard of this brand before. And I've seen that you're supposed to feed about 2-3 oz every 3 hours, but I've fed my baby two bottles now and she only ate 1oz the first time and about 1.5 the second time. How do I know when to start feeding her more? And is there a better option for warming bottles? I'm using a liquid formula right now that says to keep it refrigerated, but my mom says to warm it up, I have to fill a cup with hot water and wait for the formula to get to room temp. Is this the only way to do it? I'm currently living with my parents and I don't want to have to go into the kitchen and run hot water every few hours--I feel bad enough about having a new baby in the house, I don't want to wake them up with running the faucet. Is there a bottle warmer or something I can get? And will I have to warm the bottles if I use powdered formula, since I don't have to refrigerate them? Sorry for the rapid-fire questions, I just really don't know what I'm doing and I want to make sure I know everything. Sorry if I'm not supposed to make posts like this.</TEXT>

I really don't want to fail her by not knowing what I'm doing when it comes to formula.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having second thoughts about breastfeeding</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-17 06:43:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi again, guys. I recently posted about my decision to stop breastfeeding after 3 days. It just wasn't working right for me--my baby has suction like a two-month-old, and my nipples were already sensitive before, so I was bruised and chapped just on the first day. She didn't have a bad latch, but for some reason everything was just so painful for me. I'd rather give birth than feed her again. So, since I had a couple cans of formula as well as a bottle of liquid formula, I decided to switch to formula feeding. But now, I can't help thinking I made the wrong choice. Rosalie seems happier as a formula-fed baby, except for the fact that she now has a lot of struggles with gas. And I'm sure we can figure things out--after all, she's only been a formula baby since yesterday evening. But I can't stop thinking about nursing. It was nothing but pain and dread for me when it was happening, but suddenly I just keep thinking about it and I miss it so much. I don't even know why, because everything is better now. I just really, really want to nurse my baby again. It's probably hormones. But I know I can't do it. My nipples cannot handle it, my sanity cannot handle it, and I know I'll end up the same as I was--resenting my baby for how often she needed to eat, and not feeding her when she needed it because I dreaded it so much that I put it off whenever possible. I know you guys don't know me, like at all, and can't really help much, but I'm at such a loss. What should I do? I'm a wimp, and if the pain after 3 days was too much for me, I know I won't be able to handle it after a week. I fed just long enough for Rosalie to get all the colostrum--my breasts were hard and painful today, and I think my milk has either come in or is extremely close. How long do I have before I dry up? Is it reasonable to think I may be able to go back to it? Is it just a stupid idea, considering the trouble I had? I really don't know what to do. My nipples are sore and bruised and the skin is all coming off, and my baby even had some issues with skin coming off of her lips when I was nursing (it went away almost immediately after switching to formula). Just...please, someone tell me what to do. I'm so lost.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update: Having second thoughts about breastfeeding</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-19 08:13:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I decided to nurse again. Unfortunately, even though I know I was producing milk, my baby was still hungry after a 3 1/2 hour nursing marathon. When I finally broke down and made her a bottle of formula, she ate a full 2oz (her average has been 1.6oz per feeding) and slept for four or five hours. I'm not sure where I went wrong, because I know I was producing milk (it got absolutely everywhere when I was feeding) and I know she was swallowing, but apparently her little belly just didn't get full. A lot of people suggested I use a nipple shield to lessen the pain--I already was using one. I didn't notice any real difference, although maybe that was because my nipples were already like raw hamburger. Anyway, just wanted to give y'all a quick update. I'm honestly devastated, but it's no longer about me or what I want. It's about making sure my baby is fed and getting what she needs. Obviously my breast milk isn't cutting it anymore. I only went 1 day without nursing, but I guess that was too long.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rosalie Grey's birth story--FTM, epidural, induction, positive!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-19 08:45:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just as a warning, this will probably be long, oddly written, and details will be remembered and added in at weird times. I tried to write things down as they happened, but once I was in pain I gave zero fucks about my future birth story, and I quit updating. I also am on the autism spectrum so I focus on things differently from some people, and I happen to be a writer so while I tried to summarize things, there will be parts that seem unimportant but have extra details. I'm also writing all of this (minus this intro) at about 10 hours postpartum, but probably won't post until I'm home. My mother and I arrived at the hospital for my induction at 8:00pm. I was so incredibly nervous and scared, so I just focused on things task by task--my first task was to carry my diaper bag and Boppy into the hospital, since my mom insisted on doing everything else. We checked in and were led straight to our room. I had to get into the shower and wash my belly with red soap just in case I ended up having a c-section, then put on my napkin--I mean hospital gown--and met my first nurse. I had to fill out some paperwork, then I laid in the hospital bed and stuff started happening. The nurse hooked me up to the monitors, then I got an IV inserted (which for the record was much worse than the epidural wound up being) and the nurse used it to take a few vials of blood. Then the induction started. They didn't want to start me off immediately on pitocin due to possible complications if my cervix wasn't ready, so I got these tiny little cervical suppository things (can't remember the name of the pill). She checked my cervix while she was inserting the first pill and let me know that I was 70% effaced and 1cm dilated. The pill gave me a few mild contractions and a bit of bleeding. I got another dose at around 3am and was somewhere between 1-2cm, slightly more effaced (they didn't give me a percentage this time). I had a lot of hip/lower back pain at this point, and I was wide awake but I knew I needed to sleep, so they gave me some Benadryl and ambien (sp?) to hopefully make me drowsy, although it didn't work until 4:30, by which time my contractions were strong enough that I couldn't sleep through them. At 5:30 ish, my contractions started getting pretty painful (at least I thought they were at the time), so I asked if I could have something to take the edge off and was given a small dose of morphine. I was told I could have another dose in half an hour if it didn't work. I wound up getting the second dose at 6:10. At 7am they started me on pitocin. I was 2cm dilated, and I think I got one last cervix pill during the cervical check, although I can't be certain. I also found out that apparently Rose was face up, so I was having a lot of back labor. Which isn't fun. But I only have to be at a 3 before I could get an epidural, so I figured I wouldn't have to suffer for much longer, and with the pitocin going, they wouldn't give me any other pain meds anyway. (At this point, things got really intense, so I stopped writing what happened when it happened. I'll try my best to remember, though) My sister got there around the same time contractions started getting a little rough, and I wound up puking. Now that I'm past everything, they weren't the most awful, but at the time, they were pretty bad. I was no longer able to talk through them, and had to moan when they came up. The cervical checks got more painful and I don't remember exactly how many I got or how dilated I was at each. I think I was 3 at the next one (which I believe I got right before or right after my water broke) and finally able to get the epidural. (I don't remember exactly when my water broke, I just know it was sometime around this. I felt this weird...vibration, sort of, and then heard this pop and suddenly water was gushing out over my legs. I knew immediately what had happened, and my contractions started ramping up afterwards) While waiting, contractions ramped up to the point that I was yelling through them, pretty much wanted to die, and wound up puking again from the pain. This time, it splashed out of the bucket and got on my face, my blanket, my sheet, and my my gown, as well as down my chest and chin. My sister and my mom helped me out of my gown (no judgement about my being naked), got me a new blanket and sheet and gown, and Mom wiped my face for me. I suffered through a lot of really crappy, yelling contractions (some of which were less than a minute apart) before the anesthesiologist finally arrived and the epidural was served. When the nurse walked in with him, I was puking for a third time from the pain, and this time the nurse took the bedpan-type thing we were using (my mom just grabbed the first thing she could find that would hold puke because I had very little warning the first time it happened) and gave us a few blue barf bags. I had about 3 more crappy contractions during the epidural process, but finally everything was done and I had two doses of the medicine. The numbing needle hurt a little and the medicine burned going in, but I couldn't feel the epidural needle at all. They told me it would take a while to work completely, but the very next contraction was much better than the previous ones. I was no longer having back labor, and it just felt like a bad cramp. I don't even think I had to moan through it. Every contraction afterwards was easier and easier, until finally I couldn't feel them at all. My legs and waist were numb, but I could still move my legs, although they were heavier. The nurse flipped me over a few times, and the hardest thing about it was that my butt was so numb, but so big (I never had a butt before pregnancy put some junk in the trunk) that I couldn't tell how much was me and how much was the pillow. Epidural. Is. Life. My other sister got there shortly after I got the epidural. Turns out, I labor like my mom--I dilate really slowly, even on pitocin (or maybe especially on pitocin), but as soon as I've progressed far enough for an epidural, the medicine makes me zoom along. My cervical checks went from 4 to 6 to 9 1/2, and then I only waited half an hour before I was being prepped to push, and even then I only had to wait so long because there was another lady already birthing (there was also one waiting to go while I was birthing. Apparently 1-12-17 was a busy day for babies). At some point between those cervical checks, I managed to sleep for an hour, which was the only sleep I'd had since before I got to the hospital (and I only had 4 or 5 hours of sleep the day before we began the induction). Finally, when I reached 9 1/2, the doctor came in with a few other nurses and started preparing me and my room for birth. My sisters had to leave the room at this point, so they decided to go to Walmart or something (one had to go to work before they got back, but the other one brought me back an orchid when she came to meet the baby). I felt so fantastic after my epidural, I was sitting up, talking to the doctors, joking around, everything was great. I did throw up a fourth time, this time using a barf bag, but it was purely from nerves because I was about to give birth to a child that I'm going to have for the rest of my life. As soon as I was finished, though, I was back to having a great time. My legs got put into the stirrups, I was scooted around and things were stuck under me, and eventually I was being instructed to grab the backs of my legs and get ready to push. The nurse told me when I was having a contraction, so I knew when to push (since my contractions had been constantly off the charts for quite a while and I couldn't feel a damn thing). I pushed three times during my first contraction, then had to wait for another one. During the second one, they didn't let me have much of a break between pushes, since apparently I was a really good pusher (shocking, since I never work out or anything, and have never been in good shape). I pushed four more times, and then I could see my baby girl, all sticky and gross. All I could think of to say was "Mom, there was a baby in there! There was really a baby in there!" One of the nurses helped me unsnap my gown while another wiped the baby down a bit, and then she was placed on my bare chest for skin-to-skin. She was such an angry girl--she would cry and then stop for maybe 10-20 seconds, but even when I was holding her, she never calmed down for long. She hated everything the nurses did to her--she hated the hat, she hated the blanket, she hated the ointment in her eyes, she hated getting her temperature taken, and she hated people touching her. The doctor and the nurse he had helping him were doing all kinds of things to me during this time (delivering the placenta, cleaning up the huge mess that gushed out when Rosalie did, probably other things too) but I barely noticed because I was so busy staring in awe at the tiny person I had made. When I did look up at the doctor, he was in the middle of stitching me up, which was the only way I knew I had torn at all. I asked about it and he told me I had torn down the middle, almost like an episiotomy. I asked if it was severe, and he said no. I don't know how many stitches I actually have, but they're not incredibly bothersome. They're the worst part of postpartum so far, but they're not at all comparable to even the more mild contractions I was having. After a while, I found out about a few other things that happened during everything, like the huge gush of stuff that came out immediately after my daughter, and the fact that she came out facing sideways and the doctor turned her before I delivered her shoulders. Honestly, I can't believe how easy delivery was for me, besides that period of time where I was having those super intense contractions while waiting for the epidural. I really thought I'd have an awful time, but my labor went really smoothly, the nurses were very helpful, and the doctor was impressed by how well I did pushing out my baby, as was everybody else that was there, and everybody else that has been told that part of the story. I feel like Superwoman. There were also some things that were different from what I expected. For example, everyone talks about how many different people are in the room during the birth, but I didn't have many. Me, my mom, the doctor, a nurse to help the doctor, a nurse specifically for me, and a nurse specifically for the baby. Maybe that's a lot for other people, but I found it pretty chill. Or maybe most hospitals have more people. This was my first time experiencing a lot of things (first time being hospitalized, first time being in labor/giving birth, first time ever having stitches) so I have no idea what's normal and what's not. Also, I heard a lot about how the hospital's postpartum pads are pretty big, but I was picturing a regular overnight pad or something. These things are like the size of a Manila folder. I feel like I'm walking around wearing a frickin pizza box inside a pair or gauze shorts. But they're amazingly absorbent, and the "mesh panties" (I was expecting fishnet or something but mine are more like gauze) are actually incredibly comfortable, especially when I still feel like a partially deflated water balloon. As for Rosalie, she's been less work than I expected. Admittedly, she is currently about 10 hours old, so I know I have plenty of time to experience cluster feeding and poopy diapers and possibilities such as reflux and colic. But so far, she's been great. She was born 1/12/17, the day after her due date, at 3:55pm, was 19 inches long and weighed 8lbs 1oz, which is exactly 1lb heavier than her estimated weight at my ultrasound a week ago. She has a head full of blonde hair to make up for all the reflux and heartburn she gave me, and apparently is as surprisingly strong as her mom--she has such a strong suction when she eats, her nurse said she was eating like a 2-month-old, which helps draw out my semi-flat nipples so they haven't been an issue. The only problem we've had with breastfeeding is that she generally will suck for about 5 seconds, then forget that she's eating and I'll have to tickle her foot or move her arm around to remind her. She eats in a pattern--on for 5, off for 5. Not sure if this is normal or not. I don't have much of a postpartum update yet as it hasn't been very long (and I slept for 3 hours out of the 10 it's been since the birth), but I am loving the fact that I can now lay on my back, and that my hands can now rest on my belly without being so far away from my body. I know everyone else hates it, but I'm enjoying having a nice, squishy belly again (at least for now). I can also have coffee-flavored M amp;Ms and Dr Pepper without being judged, and I can actually reach to wipe (aka spray-and-pat) and can see things again. Bad news--I no longer have an excuse for letting my legs get hairy. But considering how much better postpartum is than late pregnancy, I'd say it's worth it. Especially now that I get to look at this little angel--this little angry, round-cheeked, vacuum-sucking angel. [Baby tax!](http://i.imgur.com/lPYipjJ.jpg) Edit: I don't know if this needs to be included, but it's been a big deal for me, so I decided to include it. I did have to quit breastfeeding. I wrote this post very early and am now finally posting at about 1 week postpartum. After 3 days, breastfeeding was absolute hell for me. My nipples were bruised and chapped within a day, and as mentioned above, Rosalie had extra strong suction. I also did not have access to a lactation consultant, so Rose wasn't checked for lip/tongue ties, and I don't know if her latch was truly good. But I was dreading every feeding session, especially since she was cluster feeding to bring in my milk. I was even using a nipple shield, but it didn't make much of a difference for me. It was still so painful, and my nipples felt like hamburger. I decided to stop breastfeeding and started my baby on formula that night. The next night, I realized I missed nursing her, and decided to try to nurse her a few times to try to keep my supply while I figured things out. There was a lot of crying, and a lot of indecisiveness. But ultimately, me decision was made for me yesterday morning. Rose woke up hungry at 3:30 ish and instead of making a bottle, I decided I wanted to stay in bed and try to nurse her again. I thought it was going well--I used the shield so the pain was minimal, and there was milk everywhere. It was running down my chest/belly, it leaked out of her mouth, it made wet spots on my bed, and I could even see it pooling in the nipple shield when she popped off my breast. I could hear her swallowing, too, so I thought we were good. I thought I could really do it. Then, she never stopped. She's pop off my breast and refuse to take it back, then start screaming a few minutes later and be back at the breast. I tried switching sides, changing positions, expressing as she sucked--I don't know what went wrong, because I was definitely producing milk. But she just never seemed to get full. Finally, at about 7am, she wouldn't stop screaming, so I just went and made a bottle of formula. She ate 2 full oz (her average has been 1.5oz per feeding), then slept for four or five hours. I have no idea what went wrong with breastfeeding, but it became very clear to me that it isn't working for us anymore, and formula feeding is what my baby needs. I'm honestly devastated, but I will do whatever my baby needs me to do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New single mom hoping to work from home--any advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-03 06:33:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, everybody. I'm extremely sorry to come here asking this, but I have no idea what to do. I truly hope this isn't against the rules, but I'm on mobile and can't figure out how to pull up the sidebar, on BaconReader or in my browser. So, here's the thing. I'm 21 years old, and have never had a job. When I was younger, my parents lost my social security card, and I never had an ID or drivers license (I actually still can't drive). I now have a state ID and am going to figure out tomorrow how to get a replacement SS card, but because I've been missing these things, I was never able to get a job. So as of right now, I have no job experience, no SS card, no education after I graduated high school, and am not able to drive, nor do I have a car. I also live with my mom and stepdad at the moment due to all kinds of confusing shit, including a pregnancy. I now have a three-week-old daughter, and while she is absolutely perfect, I am not. I haven't been able to provide for her. I just got WIC, but that's all I've been able to do myself. Her father has given us $40 so far, but otherwise all he's done since I was 15 weeks pregnant is ask how we're doing and send her a blanket, so I obviously can't rely on him (he lives in another state anyway). At this point in time, I'm not yet recovered enough from birth to physically go to a workplace, and I also know that a good chunk of my income will go towards childcare if I have to leave her, and I likely won't have enough left over to support her and myself anyway without help. So I was just hoping that someone here might be able to help me find some information on work-from-home jobs that pay enough for us to survive. I've tried looking around myself, but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing, and I just wind up pulling up these Buzzfeed-like articles that don't offer much helpful information. Again, I'm extremely sorry to bring my pathetic self here just to beg for people to help me out, but I'm really struggling. I'm a parent now--I can't keep living with my own mom while I'm trying to figure out how to be a mom myself. If nobody here has anything that can help us, or you just don't want to help us, then I may be able to figure something out eventually. It's just that reddit has been pretty helpful to people in the past, and I figured it can't hurt to at least try. I just hate that I'm such a piece of trash. I just want to be a good parent to my daughter.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-02-04 01:11:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, here's the thing. I'm 21 years old, and have never had a job. When I was younger, my parents lost my social security card, and I never had an ID or drivers license (I actually still can't drive). I now have a state ID and am going to figure out tomorrow how to get a replacement SS card, but because I've been missing these things, I was never able to get a job. So as of right now, I have no job experience, no SS card, no education after I graduated high school, and am not able to drive, nor do I have a car. I also live with my mom and stepdad at the moment due to all kinds of confusing shit, including a pregnancy. I now have a three-week-old daughter, and while she is absolutely perfect, I am not. I haven't been able to provide for her. I just got WIC, but that's all I've been able to do myself. Her father has given us $40 so far, but otherwise all he's done since I was 15 weeks pregnant is ask how we're doing and send her a blanket, so I obviously can't rely on him (he lives in another state anyway). At this point in time, I'm not yet recovered enough from birth to physically go to a workplace, and I also know that a good chunk of my income will go towards childcare if I have to leave her, and I likely won't have enough left over to support her and myself anyway without help. I've made a very similar post in /r/jobs, but since you guys are all moms, I thought I'd come ask you too. How do you working mamas do it? Is it reasonable to think I may be able to work from home, or should I just prepare myself to leave the house every day and pay a bunch of money for my baby to go to daycare or something?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So my baby had just fallen asleep on me, when I got the urgent need to go poop. When I tried to out the baby down, though, she started crying, which would be fine for a few minutes if we were alone, but we're currently in my parents' house with my mom, stepdad, two sisters, and cousin, all of whom are trying to sleep because they have church tomorrow, and it's 1am. So I strapped her into the Mei Tai and took her with me. While I was in there, she was fussy, so I rocked her and bounced her in an attempt to keep her quiet. Apparently I did too good of a job, because she wound up falling asleep, and is still sleeping know that we're back in our bed. I think she may be down for the next few hours!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-02-08 00:16:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>My daughter was born at 8lbs 1oz. I was worried she'd never fit into newborn clothes, but she fit into her nb-sized outfit to go home in with no problems. She was back up to her birth weight at her 1-week checkup, so I assumed she was gaining weight well and everything. But now she's almost 4 weeks old and still fitting into newborns. Some are even too big for her, although she's outgrown some of the sleepers. She is a skinny baby, and socks still don't fit on her feet. Is this sort of thing normal? I hear about so many 7lb babies that only wear newborn clothes for a few days or a week before moving up a size. I tried to out a 0-3 onesie on her yesterday and she was swimming in it. Edit: forgot to mention, she was born Jan 12. She was up to her birth weight on Jan 23. But we had a WIC appointment on Feb1 and she was still the same exact weight, down to the ounce.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do kids have a growth spurt or something around this time? My daughter is 6 weeks old, 7 weeks on Thursday, and for the past couple days she has been so much work. She's fussing constantly, fighting her sleep and only taking little 5-10 naps throughout the day, and she's been eating every hour or so. It's like suddenly nothing makes her happy. She has started outgrowing her newborn clothes finally, but still doesn't fit into 0-3/3 month onesies or pants yet, so she's basically got a few sleepers now and otherwise doesn't fit into any of her clothes.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-03 21:35:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my kid apparently is at this weird in-between size right now. She's 7 weeks old and hasn't been weighed by a baby scale since she was 2 weeks old, but our adult scale uses oz so I weighed myself with and without her and it came out to exactly 10lbs in difference. She has been outgrowing a lot of her newborn clothes, but she's still swimming in her 0-3 onesies and pants. All she can wear is 3 month Carters sleepers, and even some of those are getting too short in the legs. Yesterday she had a blowout through the top of her nb diaper, and then peed out the top of it last night, and I've been feeling like she was getting too big for them, so today I've been using size 1 Pampers (the same exact diapers we were using in nb size). Are they supposed to be gigantic? To make the waist of it fit her, I have to pull each tab way over to the opposite side, past the middle, and overlap the crap out of them. With the nb diapers, I brought them both exactly to the middle. When I try to look up "how is a diaper supposed to fit" and other similar searches on google, it just gives me stuff about cloth diapers, even when I use the -cloth thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have a little trip coming up in a couple of weeks. I'm going to be road-tripping about 8 hours south, staying 2 full days after we arrive, and then leaving the day after that (leaving Thursday, coming back on Sunday). My daughter is 2 months old, and I honestly have no idea what to pack. I feed her formula, and I won't be doing any of the driving, but she hates taking bottles that aren't warm, so I have that stress, along with not knowing what else to bring for the time we'll be staying there. How many diapers? How many outfits, and what kind? I don't want to overpack, but I'm the kind of person who has one or two extra outfits, two burp cloths, two receiving blankets, and a slightly larger blanket in my diaper bag even when I'm going to Walmart, just because you never know what you'll need. We also use the Dr Brown formula pitcher--would I need to bring that, or should I just leave it at home? And how much formula do I bring? Oh geez, I'm babbling, sorry. (Not deleting it though because it's an important question) Edit: idk if it matters, but I'm traveling Witt my grandma, sister, and cousin, none of whom know much about babies, so everything baby-related will be up to me. And I'm a single mom so I have no husband to ask about all this. This trip is actually (partially) meant to introduce Rose to her father</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know y'all aren't doctors, but I figured I'd ask around here just to see if anybody could be of any help. My 2-month-old daughter has suddenly gotten very fussy when I'm feeding her. For a day or two, sitting her up to eat instead of lying her back worked, but it doesn't seem to be helping anymore. She'll drink for a moment, then open her mouth and start screaming, and continue this pattern throughout the whole feeding. She keeps screaming if I try burping her, if I try sitting her up or lying her down or otherwise changing her position, if I tighten or loosen her bin. She's exclusively formula fed and has been on Gerber Gentle for almost all of her life, and has never had any problems except for in the very beginning when we switched her from Similac. We use Munchkin Latch bottles and are currently using size 1 nipples. Edit: it looks like it gets worse throughout the day? She just woke up (which is weird, she usually sleeps 12 hours straight) and ate 2 1/2 oz before she started acting weird, but she didn't cry, just kept popping off the bottle. Last night trying to out her to bed, though, she wouldn't eat for more than 20-30 seconds without screaming.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-04-13 18:30:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, so I know this gets posted A LOT around here, and the general rule is that if baby can get to their tummies themselves, it's safe to let them sleep that way. But I was wondering what makes it safe? My baby started rolling onto her belly the day before she turned 3 months (so Tuesday), but she can't go from belly to back yet. She's also kind of young to be rolling, according to all the apps and milestone lists I find everywhere. Is it still okay for her to sleep on her belly? I've always thought babies typically go from belly to back before they go back to belly, so I thought that was what made it safe. What really sets the mark, though?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it just me, or does it seem like people are sexualizing babies a lot now? I'm in the baby section on Wish because a lot of stuff is free on Wish right now, but I'm seeing so many weird slogans on onesies and outfits. "Daddy's Other Chick" and "Daddy's #\WCW" and "I found my prince, his name is Daddy" are the first few that come to mind. I also remember a onesie I received as a gift that said "Sorry boys, Daddy says I can't date until I'm 30!" That one promptly went into the donation box. And I see a lot of boys stuff that says "Ladies man" and "I'm here, ladies!" and stuff like that, too. What's with that? I even saw some baby high heels on Facebook! I'm one of the only women I know who isn't picky about girls stuff. Ring too pink or too frilly, but come on. And it's not just clothes, there have been plenty of times that I've seen a little boy or baby boy saying hi to people, and as soon as he says hi to a woman, his mother or some other person will say "Oh, he's a little flirt!" Or when two babies of the opposite sex are together, I hear a lot of comments like "Oh, is he/she your little boy/girlfriend?" and "Are you guys gonna get maaarried?" I mean, seriously, what gives?

    <TEXT>Sorry to ask this, I'm just kinda not sure what's going on. I just changed my baby's poopy diaper (5 months old) and when I was wiping, I saw some red dots. They went away when I wiped them, but then they came back. I realized she was bleeding. The skin on her bum felt rough and a bit raw. But she wasn't sitting in her poop long enough for it to have irritated her. My mom thinks it may be a reaction to food. We've started her on solids and make a mix of formula, oatmeal, and some jarred baby food. The past few days, I believe she's had Beech Nut in apple/mango/kiwi. I can't remember which foods she's had before, other than pear/raspberry. I know she's only had fruits. I'm worried it might be something else. I feel like a food allergy would have made her tongue or lips swell or something. We did just switch her to a new size of diapers, but we only use Pampers Baby Dry. Yesterday we switched to size 3, could that possibly have anything to do with it? She also pooped again earlier, and her bum was fine then. Her second poop was a little more liquid and a bit greener, though. We haven't switched wipes (been using Pampers Sensitive), the only new things are the diapers (ish) and the food, which we've fed her for a few days now. Could it have taken this long to affect her? I plan on talking to the doctor about it if it persists or if anyone here raises concern.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so so sorry to post this, I just don't really know where else to turn. The best deals I've found are on Facebook marketplace, but none of the clothes are right. My baby has a weird body--she's right on track for weight and height, but for some reason she's just moving into 3-6 month clothes (6 month from Carters) and she's 6 months old. The only clothes that seem to fit her right are Carters stuff and those Gerber sleepers you can buy in sets of two. We have some 0-3 sleepers that still fit her, and a few 3-6 for when she outgrows them, but what she needs are outfits to wear outside of the house. The best outfits for her are the "little character sets" from Carters that come with two onesies and a pair of pants, but I only have $30 so I'd only be able to buy two of them if I spent it all. I don't have an income yet, and her father has been making me think he might come back and suddenly is having trouble deciding between his kids because he just had a baby with someone else, so I'm officially 100% a single mom now. So I guess I'm just wondering if you ladies might have app recommendations or something? I have a couple apps, but after adding the shipping costs, I can't get anything worth it. I've found one listing near me for the clothes she needs, but the person selling them keeps being weird and flaky and I've decided to give up. Plus half the outfits (it was 7 sets for $40) say "Wild about daddy" or "I put a spell on daddy" and I just don't want the awkwardness of putting her in something like that when Daddy can't even find the balls to take care of her outside of sending $200 a month.</TEXT>

I was able to get some 30-minute intervals out of her in the hospital, but we started bedsharing pretty soon because I needed sleep to function, especially by myself. Fast forward, my daughter is 15 months old and the bed is getting cramped. She #8217;s got a crib, she just refuses to sleep in it. I #8217;ve managed to wait her out until she falls asleep, but she only does this while standing up and hanging onto the side. She refuses to lie down in it and just stands and screams. I try not to let it go on because I live in an apartment building and just can #8217;t stand hearing her cry, plus I usually don #8217;t get home from work until 11-ish and by that time I want to go to bed without messing with it. But at this point I #8217;d rather she just have some independence. Is there a way to move her this late or have I screwed myself?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you go about finding a school despite having no money and no time?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-09 06:57:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>My life went in kind of backwards order. When I was 19, I moved in with my boyfriend who I didn #8217;t realize was abusive and manipulative. I end up getting pregnant and have to move away temporarily (long story) and while I #8217;m gone, he dumps me. So now I #8217;m 23, my daughter turns 2 on Saturday, and I have my own apartment, but no drivers license and I work at Walmart making $11.50 an hour. All I want is to better my life. I have a deep, deep passion for ocean life and would like to learn how it works, why it works the way it does, and try to find ways to help our dying oceans. But I never learned how to look for a school, and I usually run out of money between paychecks (currently have $3 and some change, for example). My daughter does go to daycare but can #8217;t stay past 6pm. Is there a way for a woman with no time and no money to start going to school? Are there maybe some grants available for someone in my position? How do I find info on colleges and figure out which ones offer the classes I #8217;d need (actually, how do I even find out which classes I #8217;d need?)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Items to have multiples of for each person?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-20 15:59:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, so I can #8217;t figure out how to phrase that very well, but hopefully it makes some sense. I #8217;ve got everything I need in my BOB and am working on getting a nice stockpile of food and water for bugging in. My household just includes me and my two-year-old daughter, so I made sure we had enough for both of us. But my parents and sisters live about 10 minutes away, and if something were to happen, I #8217;d like to include them in my plans, so I #8217;m working on some small kits for them. My question is: which items will I need to have multiples of for each person? I know it #8217;s probably a good idea to have at least a pocket knife for each of us, and I #8217;ve made little  #8220;red river #8221; kits for the women (since my dad is the only man, that #8217;s kind of a priority). I also have paracord bracelets for each of us which include whistles, LED lights with regular/SOS/strobe settings, compasses, fire starters, and small multi-tools with blades, saw edges, small wrenches, and small flathead screwdrivers Edit: just wanted to mention that the plan is to stay together. My BOB has all the essentials, these mini bags are more for things that everyone should have for themselves. For example, we won #8217;t all need our own camp stove, but we might all need our own flashlights. Edit 2: [update available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/bcru7p/help_me_finish_my_individual_survival_kits/) for anyone hoping to find more information in the future)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help finding a specific type of lighter?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-07 17:44:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So for some reason, my weak ass has trouble flicking lighters. The wheels hurt my thumb more than they should, and I #8217;m not able to light them, or I can #8217;t keep them lit when I do manage it. A few years ago, my ex gave me a lighter that I was able to light. It looked like a zippo, rectangular and silver, but the lighting mechanism was more like a button. It didn #8217;t hurt me and I was able to keep my lighter lit as long as I needed it. But I can #8217;t seem to actually find this lighter anymore. I thought it was just a zippo so I bought one, but it wasn #8217;t the right lighting mechanism and now I have a zippo that I can #8217;t light. When I try to look for the right lighter, it just pulls up electric bic lighters or electric lighters that look like tasers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me finish my individual survival kits</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-13 15:47:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Disclaimer: I know everyone says this, but I am on mobile so I apologize if the formatting gets all fucked up. I #8217;ll try to edit once I have access to a computer, if I need to. So a little while ago, I made a post about making smaller individual kits for the people I #8217;ll most likely be with in any disaster, ranging from a tornado to full SHTF. I have a larger  #8220;BOB #8221; (not just for bugging out, but that #8217;s the simplest way to put it) but I noticed there were some things that each person might want to have for themselves, so I started putting together smaller backpacks full of gear that we would need multiples of each person, like flashlights. I have things like a camp stove/pot set in my big bag, along with all my personal gear (same stuff that #8217;s in these kits). Each kit is color coded, partially for fun and partially so we can tell what belongs to who. People aren #8217;t going to want to use each other #8217;s toothbrushes, for example. Also, I figured we could use our colors to communicate. Like if we #8217;re sweeping an area, we can tell who #8217;s been where by the color of the tape or bandanna or paint. Or if someone gets separated from the rest of the group, they can try to leave a trail and we #8217;ll know which way they went, as long as there are no other random yellow bandannas around. And it honestly just helps me to personally keep everything organized. Not every item in the packs is color coded, although I have used paint markers to help with some items (such as flashlights). There are 6 kits, one for each of my 3 sisters, both parents, and my young daughter (although her kit is a bit larger and includes a few extra things). All except one are for women, so they include period kits, and I #8217;m working on a shaving kit for the only man. Each kit includes the following: * 3-in-1 eating utensil * collapsible bowl * 2 colorful bandanas (one made of a thinner fabric, and one of s thicker fabric) * folding knife (each one is slightly different to account for each person #8217;s tastes) * dust mask with extra inserts * Rite in the Rain notebook full of information on things like first aid * headlamp * small flashlight * bic lighter * AA and AAA batteries * water purification tablets * 10 fire tinders * foil emergency blanket * white * 9 pouches of emergency water (3-5 days worth) * high calorie food bars (3 days worth) * Tube of Advil * Duct tape * Mio water flavoring * 20-in-1 paracord bracelet (includes whistle, SIM card pin, ~10ft of paracord, LED light with three different settings, T-shaped knife with screwdrivers, small button compass, small ferrocerium rod and scraper, Celsius thermometer, and a small card tool with another sharp edge, wrenches, and a small saw edge. Admittedly the bracelets are a bit gimmicky, but it #8217;s mostly just a way to keep accessible paracord on your person. I did replace the paracord it came with to ensure that I could trust the quality of the cord used) * travel toiletry kit (includes toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, healing lotion, deodorant, comb, floss picks, and an empty baggie) * a brimmed hat attached to the outside (because I doubt they #8217;ll think of hats even if they #8217;re given time to prepare) All kits except for the orange one have a couple feminine extras, since most of the group will be women. Each one has a camping urination device to make it easier, and a period kit containing: * pads (currently disposable but I plan on getting reusable as soon as my budget allows) * tampons * menstrual cups * small pack of tissues * black pair of underwear * plastic baggies for anything dirty * few pieces of chocolate * Small brush (not period related, but there #8217;s not one in my dad #8217;s kit since he doesn #8217;t really have hair) I am also working on an extra kit for my dad since he obviously won #8217;t need the period stuff. Definitely going to involve some shaving stuff, thinking of adding some baby powder or desitin for chafing as well. A lot of people recommended alcohol but my parents are very religious (which is why shaving is such a big deal) and would most likely get angry, so that #8217;s out. I also plan on getting reusable water bottles with filters for each person. I #8217;ve considered perhaps adding a small (like altoid-size) first aid kit for each, but then again I do also have a fully-prepared BOB. These kits are meant to contain items we #8217;ll all need for ourselves, such as light sources, even when we #8217;re all together, and a few things to keep everyone going in case we do get separated. I was going to post this as an update on my original post, but I figured more people would see it if I just made a new post. Plus it wound up being quite a bit longer than I expected it to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;ll admit, most of the people I #8217;ve seen talking about this were in a Facebook group for wiccans and pagans, but a lot of witches seem to have felt something in the middle of last night. Some of us were still awake and had weird feelings, some of us were awoken from our sleep. I had just fallen asleep and suddenly startled awake, and when I looked over my two-year-old was awake as well, just staring at me. My best friend (the only other witch I know irl) said she was still awake but felt some sort of buzz. Some of the witches in that group were saying there was some sort of ripple, so I was just curious, did anyone here experience anything like that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I accidentally placed an end table right in the doorway of my storage shed. I was able to leave the building and I can still walk in the door, but now I can #8217;t go past the doorway. Might not be an issue, except I #8217;m playing on mobile (iOS specifically) and can #8217;t seem to pick it up. I #8217;m still figuring out the controls and everything, but all I can do is basically tap or hold on the screen, both of which make me walk out the door since I #8217;m essentially standing on the threshold. Anyone have any idea how to unfuck myself? I don #8217;t want to tear the shed down and rebuild it since it had all my stuff in it, but I can #8217;t think of anything else to do Edit: I figured it out! Just in case anyone else would like to know what I did, I just changed the controls. I walked into the shed, then changed my controls so that tapping around didn #8217;t move my character anymore. After a bit more tapping and holding, I was able to pick up the table.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question for modders</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-12 04:17:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I know nothing about modding, programming, coding, really any of the techie stuff. I can create texture packs and that #8217;s about as advanced as I #8217;ve gotten. But when browsing through the addons and mods available on the web, I noticed that there are very few that add crops to the game, and none of them seem to do so properly. Is that something that #8217;s very difficult or impossible to make a mobile-friendly mod/addon for, or is it just something that has little demand? All I want is fruit trees and a variety of crops, purely for aesthetic and collecting purposes. Something like Pam #8217;s Harvestcraft but without the recipes and food items. There are mods for all sorts of things, I just haven #8217;t found any that add working crops. Is it a different type of behavior file that can #8217;t be replicated, maybe? (Note: this isn #8217;t whining or demanding a new mod, just straight up curiosity since I know nothing)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I know crystals and herbs and flowers are often added to regular candles, which is a hazard. I #8217;ve made a few candles with toppings, but I #8217;ve always taken the pretties out before burning so nothing ignited or shatters. My question is, does that risk still present itself if there #8217;s no flame? Could someone make wax melts and add herbs or flowers without a problem? I can #8217;t help feeling like plants wouldn #8217;t be a problem, but what about crystal chips? They #8217;d still get hot, right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m on iOS too! You #8217;ll need the files app and/or the Documents app by Readdle (I use both). What I personally do is download a texture pack from a site like MCPEDL and erase the files from the folders within. Texture packs come in a zipped folder that you #8217;ll need to unzip first. All the textures you #8217;ll need will be sorted into folders within a folder called  #8220;textures #8221;, which I believe is in a folder called  #8220;assets #8221; (you may need to do some searching first). Each type of folder will be named something like items, blocks, GUI, etc. When you open each folder, they should have a bunch of small .png files named after each block. The file for diorite will be in the  #8220;blocks #8221; folder. You #8217;ll need to delete the .png files that you don #8217;t want, but I #8217;d recommend keeping all the folders just so you don #8217;t have to recreate them later if you decide to add anything. Make sure you pay attention to the name of the file so you can copy it exactly, otherwise it won #8217;t work. Move the texture you want to use into the folder, and name it according to the block you #8217;re trying to replace. Then you just need to zip the file again and you should be good. Make sure that when you zip it, you #8217;re not recipient the whole folder (let #8217;s say this one is named ZigZag texture pack). When you first open the zip file, it should have a few things at first, including a pack manifest and pack icon. You #8217;ll want to select all of those things and then zip it. If this doesn #8217;t make sense or if it still doesn #8217;t work because I missed a step, you can always find a YouTube video or tutorial somewhere. I #8217;m not great at explaining but I wanted to try to help instead of just saying  #8220;look it up on YouTube bro #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, also, if you #8217;re on ios 1.13 or later, you #8217;ll need the files app to add the pack to your Minecraft. All the editing can be done in Documents, but once you #8217;ve got your finished zip file, you #8217;ll have to copy it into the files app, then make sure to move it into the proper folder. On My iPhone  gt; Minecraft  gt; games  gt; com.mojang  gt; resource_packs. You can unzip it there (so if you #8217;re on this version of iOS, I guess I was wrong about the zip file). Final  #8220;product #8221; should be a folder in the resource_packs folder named after the resource pack you used. It can have another folder inside, but it should have those other files I mentioned earlier in it. So again, using ZigZag as an example name, it would go resource_packs  gt; ZigZag  gt; ZigZag  gt; files, or resource_packs  gt; ZigZag  gt; files I just went into my collection of packs and I have some with the extra folder and some without it, they both seem to work on mine</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your altar is for you, no one else. I #8217;ll admit I #8217;m not actually Wiccan, I #8217;m a Hellenistic witch and I kind of follow my own path. But every witch I #8217;ve ever spoken to has had a completely different altar. What matters is that it speaks to you, and it holds that special meaning for you. If you plan on using your altar as a workspace then of course you #8217;ll need some room for it, but there #8217;s really no right way to have an altar. The only eight is altar is an altar that feels right. Mine is practically just a clutter of candles, seashells, and offerings for my gods, but it #8217;s mine, it took a long time to set it up, and I #8217;m always adding or taking things away as my craft changed. My altar flows with my practice. It #8217;s perfect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly don #8217;t know a bunch about Wicca, which is why I #8217;m on this sub. Hellenistic is Greek centric. I think I probably should have said  #8220;eclectic #8221; in my original comment, something like that to imply that I draw inspiration from everywhere (sorry, it #8217;s been a long work day and I #8217;m struggling with words at this point). I don #8217;t follow things such as the threefold rule or the Wiccan rede, I only follow the Greek pantheon and unless one of my gods shows me a sign that they do or don #8217;t like something I #8217;m doing or considering, it #8217;s pretty much up to me. Hellenistic pretty much means following the Greek pantheon. Wiccans can follow the Greek pantheon, but I don #8217;t follow the things that make it Wicca. Sorry, I #8217;m sure that was like 87% word salad, it #8217;s kind of hard to explain the difference when you can #8217;t English anymore and don #8217;t know much about one subject  #128517; Maybe someone a little more knowledgeable and somewhat more awake than me will be able to help explain it better</TEXT>

I hope they #8217;re okay, but that #8217;s all I can do for them is hope. If you have the resources and you have a good relationship with your neighbors, then I think it #8217;s super nice of you to share, but make sure you don #8217;t also have some shorty neighbors who will rob you if you find out or tell anybody else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sure would be nice to have that much money! Unfortunately most of us don #8217;t. At my daycare, almost all of the kids are able to attend because their parents get government assistance. Some of us have copays, some of us don #8217;t make enough for that. But taking our kids out of daycare and finding the money for a nanny or babysitter is absolutely not an option. And we #8217;re not going to just ask some random stranger to watch our kids IF they don #8217;t work just because they also have kids. You #8217;re demonstrating a substantial lack of understanding how this works and why we need the daycare. Do I want my baby girl in daycare right now? No. But I work in a fast food drive thru. We #8217;re almost certainly going to stay open when everyone else is shut down. My mother just had a surgery and can #8217;t care for a three-year-old, and I have nobody else. Paying someone would take all of my money, so I might as well just stay at home and not work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, we know the tests are limited. I #8217;m not saying  #8220;oh my god they #8217;re not even testing us it #8217;s all a big conspiracy #8221; or something, I #8217;m just saying the amount of cases is definitely greater than what #8217;s being reported due to the lack of tests. When someone is exposed to the virus, shows many or all symptoms of the virus, and tests negative for the flu, it #8217;s fairly obvious that they have the virus. But without that positive test, they #8217;re not added into the official reported numbers. And also, when we only test certain types of people, it throws our numbers off. If you only test older people with underlying conditions, then all the data comes back saying the only people getting sick are older people with underlying conditions. All the young, otherwise healthy people who have the virus aren #8217;t going to be counted, making other people think that it won #8217;t affect them because they #8217;re young and healthy and we #8217;re only reporting 53 cases</TEXT>

Telling a depressed person not to kill themselves for literally any reason isn #8217;t going to make them think  #8220;her this dumbass on the Internet is right, I guess there #8217;s a better option that I #8217;ve never ever in my life considered because I just jumped straight to killing myself and never considered fixing things instead! #8221; Why would you think that telling someone with an eating disorder that they #8217;re beautiful is going to make them better? Especially when you #8217;re saying it in that way. Let me tell you what you sound like, as someone with an eating disorder.  #8220;Hey, you know how you go through all that shit just to try to make your body look the way you want it to? Yeah, well you #8217;re still gross, and it #8217;s making me uncomfortable that you look like that. I know better than you because you obviously haven #8217;t considered that you might be hurting yourself. Just stop, because it #8217;s very easy to just start eating again when you #8217;re used to starving, and you #8217;ll make me feel better because I #8217;ll think I saved someone. #8221; Is that what you said? No. But we #8217;re sick. There #8217;s literally no reason on this entire planet for you to look at someone, think they #8217;re too thin, assume they #8217;re must have an eating disorder, and then COMMENT ON IT and make them feel even worse than they already do. Do you really think you #8217;re going to chance a single person #8217;s mind here?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Acting like your problems aren #8217;t good enough compared to everyone else #8217;s is one of the things that will make yours worse. Depression hits everyone, often for no reason. It #8217;s all valid, no matter how severe, no matter your age, no matter your situation. I #8217;ve been through a lot, I cut myself every day or two, and I only talk about it with internet strangers who have no idea who I am. I still convince myself almost every day that I #8217;m just doing it for attention, or that other people have it worse and I #8217;m just being a baby. Those feelings of invalidation attack everyone at some point. And even if you were doing it for attention, that proves that something is going on. People don #8217;t just  #8220;get depressed for attention #8221; and if they are doing something for attention, there #8217;s definitely something there. It means they #8217;re not getting it when they need it. Yours valid no matter what.</TEXT>

Instead of closing down or something, they #8217;re calling other stores and asking us to send our employees to work at their store. I #8217;m pretty sure that #8217;s not ok but can #8217;t remember which store is doing that so I guess we #8217;ll just die lol</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I have a three year old daughter and she knows mom gets a lot of booboos, but honestly I don #8217;t know what to say to her aside from that. I #8217;ve never cut in front of her of course, but I #8217;ve worn shorts around the house so obviously she #8217;s seen them. She goes to daycare and I #8217;m terrified of what she might say. Even if I don #8217;t try to talk to her about them, I worry that she #8217;ll tell her teachers that Mom has a lot of booboos on her legs or something.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>You can wear long sleeves, or maybe fake sick. If you have a uterus, try the period excuse. For future reference, look up performance or compression sleeves. They #8217;re just long sleeves that go under your clothes and are made for athletic use. When wind rubs (wrong word I know but I #8217;ve been at work all day and the brain is no longer doing the brain thing) against the fabric, they really help cool you down. I wear them to work since I work in fast food and we don #8217;t have an air conditioner or fan in the back window.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Technically all of our problems are in our heads. I have trauma, depression, anxiety, probably some other shit but I #8217;m not self diagnosing. That #8217;s all mental. Real things happened but it #8217;s all in the past. Mental illnesses can be triggered by real things, or by nothing. It #8217;s a chemical imbalance in your brain. You can have the  #8220;perfect life #8221; and have worse depression than someone who #8217;s been abused and assaulted and everything. And it #8217;s not anyone #8217;s fault.

        <TEXT>Credit to u/sinfuldemon for the picture. My sister (ride home from work) was rushing me today. I told her her I #8217;d be late because of a meeting we had and she said she wouldn #8217;t be able to pick me up, so I told her I #8217;d just skip it. Then I found out I couldn #8217;t, so I told her to go ahead and go back to work. A coworker offers to take me to pick up my daughter and take us home, so we get to the daycare and then I find out my sister had already picked her up and dropped her off at my aunt #8217;s house. Also my sister is mad at me now because she thinks I was yelling at her over the phone. So now I have to wait at home for my aunt to get off work and bring my daughter to me, which means I have real alone time in my apartment, and a 100 box of razors.

        <TEXT>[This](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) shows the case numbers for the day. If you scroll down, it shows the numbers for each country. If you click where it says United States, it shows you a more detailed page and you can scroll down to see the numbers for each individual state as well. Give me a moment and I #8217;ll find the video of Trump Edit: [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=aN1eptTaWVM) is one of the videos of Trump talking about testing. In context, he #8217;s basically bragging and saying that other countries have more cases than we do but just don #8217;t test. If you check the right side of the charts in the worldometers link, it also shows you how many tests have been performed by each country, and if you click the United States page, it shows the same for each individual state.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I mostly see positive stuff about yeeting for attention, at least around here. I think I saw a post slamming  #8220;attention yeeters #8221; recently and shortly afterwards, there was a post on how yeeting for attention is just as valid as any other reason and it got more positive attention. If you lack attention so much that you feel the need to harm yourself as a way to get it, you still need help. You #8217;re still in pain, you #8217;re still valid. Normal/healthy people do not cut themselves. I think most of us feel like we #8217;re faking or something, and none of us are. We #8217;re all valid. You #8217;re valid.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>They still are :) My mom doesn #8217;t believe bisexuals exist, she thinks they #8217;re being greedy and weak for not being able to make up their minds. She also doesn #8217;t believe in mental illness, she thinks depression is an excuse to be lazy. She thinks suicide is the easy way out and only cowards do it. My stepdad is incredibly racist, homophobic, classist, probably ableist, definitely sexist, drops slurs and hard r #8217;s every day (were incredibly white btw). I also grew up with a shitty stepmom who told me the backs of my knees were fat and ugly when I was nine. *The backs of my knees*. Also, both sets of parents are Pentecostal apostolic, which is the one where women can #8217;t wear makeup or jewelry or pants, only long hair and long sleeves and long skirts. Men aren #8217;t allowed to have beards, not allowed to work on Sundays, and praying at the church often involves screaming and always involves crying. I #8217;m an adult with my own kid now but they never taught me to drive so I #8217;m still stuck living 15 minutes away from them so my mom can drive me to work</TEXT>

Every time I see one of those comments it #8217;s implying that women aren #8217;t valid and men have it so much worse and that #8217;s not ok. Men have problems, yes, nobody is denying that.

        <TEXT>I know a lot of us are tired of hearing these things, but you can try the rubber band method if you need pain, or the red marker method if you just need the visuals. You can also try rubbing an ice cube with some red food coloring at the end against your skin. When I needed the feeling of cutting but wasn #8217;t able to mark myself permanently, I used to take a plastic fork and scratch at my skin. Like the same motion as cutting, except I didn #8217;t end up with any open wounds. It helped more than scratching because it felt closer to the real thing, but didn #8217;t actually break the skin so it was much safer. I would go with one of these things in the moment, and then try reading a book, watching a tv show or YouTube video, listening to some music or a podcast to try to calm down afterwards. I personally will start watching an anime I like, usually will just pick an episode of one I #8217;ve already seen and enjoyed, and then spend some time daydreaming about myself in that universe.</TEXT>

        <TITLE>To everyone who thinks going deeper will make you feel more valid</TITLE>
        <DATE>2020-09-17 20:19:47</DATE>
        <TEXT>TW JUST IN CASE IDK HOW MUCH i #8217;M GOING TO DESCRIBE SO IM SO SORRY. It won #8217;t. I will admit I have had two bottles of wine so I am extremely sorry if this doesn #8217;t make sense due to typos, I will edit before I post and probably come back and edit again later. But going deeper doesn #8217;t make you feel any better. Speaking as someone who just hit fat for the first time, I don #8217;t feel any better than I did a few hours ago. Looking at this, there #8217;s no way I didn #8217;t hit fat. I #8217;ve had this goal in my mind for so long. I know it #8217;s not good but I #8217;ve had it in my head that if I don #8217;t hit beans, I #8217;m not going deep enough and I #8217;m not valid. And you know how I feel now that I #8217;ve hit it? Still not good enough. I still need to go deeper. I need to have more than just two fat cuts right by each other. I need to use more than four fresh blades per session. No matter what I do, it will never be enough. I could literally lose a limb and I #8217;d feel like it #8217;s my fault and I #8217;m still not doing enough somehow. It #8217;s not worth is. I #8217;ll never be able to get the yeet juice out of my carpet. I #8217;m just glad I did this in my bedroom and not my living room where someone may see it, because it #8217;s all over me and all over my bed and all over my blanket and all over my carpet. It #8217;s not worth it. I #8217;ll never get this out and I #8217;m going to lose my deposit on this apartment. I don #8217;t feel any better, I just threw up. Literally nothing is better, and now I have to worry about my leg getting infected. I don #8217;t have the money to go to the emergency room. No matter how much you feel like you need to go deeper, it #8217;s not worth it. Trust me. It #8217;s not worth it. It #8217;s not worth paying over $75 because I don #8217;t have insurance, it #8217;s not worth having to admit everything to someone because I can #8217;t afford an ambulance ride. I #8217;m going to have to call my sister or my mom if I want a ride to the ER. It #8217;s not worth the looks I know I #8217;ll get from the ER nurses. Its not worth having to get dressed when I still feel so sick. I know this won #8217;t make a difference, but in my desperation, I had to try to tell someone what it #8217;s like to want to hit beans for so long and finally achieve your  #8220;goal #8221;. It #8217;s not worth it. I though it would be different; I thought I #8217;d feel more valid. Instead I #8217;m jus throwing up in my bathroom, wondering how tf I #8217;m going to make this better and scared I #8217;m going to do it again. The urges never stop. All I #8217;ve wanted is this, and I know I #8217;m going to want to it again. This sucks. I #8217;m so tired of being addicted to yeeting, and I #8217;m tired of not feeling any better when I do it. I feel like I can #8217;t stop, mostly due to feelings of being valid or invalid. I fucking hate this. I don #8217;t want to do it anymore, I want my scars to heal. I just want to be normal. To anyone who thinks it will get better if you hit fat or something, it won #8217;t. I #8217;m so so sorry you feel like that. But it won #8217;t get any better, I promise, you #8217;ll find something else to fixate on, or you #8217;ll just hate yourself, please don #8217;t do it. I #8217;m begging you. Please don #8217;t feel like you need to go any deeper. It. Does. Not. Help. Side note: I want to mention that I am not looking for sympathy here. I #8217;ve had this goal in my head for so long, and now that I #8217;ve reached it and it feels so inadequate, I #8217;m desperate to stop someone else from making the same mistakes. I had the day off work and my mother took my daughter to daycare for me, so I thought it was safe to have a couple drink. I had two full bottles of wine, got sick four times, and sliced my leg until I could see the fat. I don #8217;t feel any better. If anything, I feel worse. If anyone else feels like they have to hit fat to feel right, please please please please believe me. It will not help. It makes you feel worse. You look at this layer of skin, this area that nobody should ever see at all, let alone in their own body, and you think  #8220;it #8217;s not good enough #8221;. You think you need to do more. You need to see it everywhere. And it #8217;s not worth it. Even for the validation. Please please please please don #8217;t do it. I can #8217;t even stress this enough. It #8217;s not worth it. It #8217;s not worth it. It #8217;s not worth it.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>It #8217;s the difference between permanent scars and temporary marks. Bruising my wrist and continuing to hit that same spot isn #8217;t any better than cheering. If anything, yeeting feels so much better. But the rubber band is still self harm and it still leaves marks. Just because I won #8217;t see those marks in a year doesn #8217;t mean it #8217;s healthy.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>So I posted earlier but I don #8217;t think anyone can see it. Basically was just me begging people not to hit beans. I just did for the first time today and it #8217;s NOT worth it. And now aside for me everything I capitalized on in my post, and aside from going out to the car won #8217;t all to my mom with yeet juice dripping down my leg, I don #8217;t know how long it will take for this to heal, even after it stops...y #8217;know, juicing. Like I still have scars from styros I did a month ago. How long will it take for my bean yeet to be a scar and not like a hole?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yep, I was like this just a few days ago. I was so sure that hitting beans would make me feel better, or at least more valid. Then I did it and it didn #8217;t make me feel any better at all. They #8217;re the only cuts I have that I know for sure will scar up forever, but it doesn #8217;t feel any more validating than cat scratches. And now I #8217;m afraid that every time I yeet, if I don #8217;t hit beans, I #8217;m going to feel like I #8217;m not doing enough.  #8220;I did it before so I know I can do it, so why am I not doing it anymore? #8221; It #8217;s going to invalidate every experience for the rest of my life. It #8217;s not worth it. I wasted so much gauze, so many steri strips, and I #8217;m still wasting bandaids. I couldn #8217;t afford the ER so I couldn #8217;t get them stitched up. I could get an infection and lose my leg now. Every time I see them or think about them, I get nauseous.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>You #8217;re not a disappointment, relapse is part of recovery. Almost nobody can quit cold turkey, and the ones who are able to usually have a really, really powerful influence that helps with it. It takes A LOT to quit an addiction. People who are successful usually have help, including a big support system. It #8217;s not impossible to stop all by yourself, but it #8217;s hard as fucking hell. It #8217;s hard even with other people around. Relapse is completely normal. It #8217;s just another step in recovery. If the counter isn #8217;t working for you, you could try keeping track a different way. Like instead of having  #8220;O DAYS CLEAN #8221; blaring in your face, try getting a calendar or a planner with a calendar in it. Draw a red dot or something every time you relapse. Then instead of just seeing that it #8217;s only been one day since the last time, you #8217;ll see that you #8217;ve only done it once in the past month or so, for example. That way it doesn #8217;t wipe away all the progress you #8217;ve made. Because it doesn #8217;t. One relapse doesn #8217;t undo all the time you went without it. You #8217;re still strong. Even if you still can #8217;t go more than a day or two, you #8217;re still strong just for wanting to stop.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>So I hit fat about a week ago. I #8217;ve had a big bandaid over it ever since then, changing it every night and once during the day, and the skin is starting to get really irritated where the adhesive sticks to my skin. Plus I #8217;m going through a lot of bandaids and I don #8217;t have the money to go through a box a week. TW DESCRIPTION When I take the bandaid off, it doesn #8217;t look as deep as it was before. I think it #8217;s trying to form a scab, but everything #8217;s still like...gooey I guess. Would it harden if I left it uncovered for a little bit, or does it harden under the bandage? When can I stop wearing bandages over it?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I #8217;d recommend trying to find non-adhesive coverings if you can, like gauze pads and stretch bandages/wraps. I hit beans almost two weeks ago and have had big bandaids on it since then, changing once or twice a day, and my skin is all fucked up from the constant adhesive. Like it doesn #8217;t even feel like skin anymore, and there are multiple spots where the skin just kinda tore when I took the bandaids off. You should keep it covered for a few weeks, so finding something less irritating will help a lot.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I literally hit beans and wore a bandaid over it for like a week and a half. The little wound I have from the bandaid is way more painful than the actual yeet</TEXT>

        <TEXT>It depends, not all of them are the same. I #8217;ve done it a few times. The first time, I knew I had hit beans and still went over it one or two more times, so that one definitely needed stitches. I didn #8217;t get any because I don #8217;t have money or a ride to the ER, but I should have. The second time, I barely hit them. It was essentially a deep styro that had some orange bubbles at the bottom of it. That one wasn #8217;t so bad. I honestly can #8217;t tell you how to properly care for them, I used steri strips for my big one but it was leaking yeet juice for a few hours so they didn #8217;t stay on for long and I ended up just using big bandaids for a while. I know you should keep them covered at least, otherwise you risk a nasty infection. And also make sure you don #8217;t use toilet paper or tissues on them, as the fibers can get stuck inside and cause an infection. I #8217;m lucky I had the insight to get some steri strips and stock up on gauze. I wasn #8217;t planning on going that deep, it just happened, but I #8217;m glad I had what I needed. I can tell you that the healing process is different from styros, it #8217;s really weird. Idk if maybe I had the bandaids on for too long, but it took two weeks for my big ones to scab over, and it was really gross during that time period. Even now, it looks really weird. I think it #8217;s been three or four weeks since it happened and my dumb ass keeps picking the scabs off, so they #8217;re really raised. Really wouldn #8217;t recommend bean yeets, if you can control yourself please don #8217;t do it. The healing has sucked ass so far and they #8217;re not even healed yet, I can feel the scars through my jeans because they #8217;re so raised, and it didn #8217;t make me feel any better. I thought maybe I #8217;d at least feel valid, but now I just feel invalid every time I don #8217;t reach beans, and I #8217;ve been kind of spiraling since then.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I bought a bottle of wine and had plans to drink the whole thing and finish scarring yo my thighs since I #8217;m really self conscious about how the placement of my scars makes my legs look (I know it #8217;s stupid). Instead, I ended up baking for the first time and now I have a loaf of milk bread and no new scars :)</TEXT>
