    <TEXT>Today mom stared to yell at my sister because she accidentally hit over her wine bottle and started to hit her. I told her to stop but she smacked me instead and said that we bitches and we are just like our father. My father is a liar, cheater, abuser, and child molester. That why we move away from him. So when she said that i snap I broke down crying and said your the reason I want to die.</TEXT>
