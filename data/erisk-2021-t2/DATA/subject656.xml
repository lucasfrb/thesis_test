    <DATE>2014-07-10 09:38:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I have a little question about the lockout on the OHP. I heard it should be the easiest part of the lift since it is identical to the lockout on the bench (using the same mussles: triceps mainly). Yet the lockout is the part of the movement I'm having the most trouble with. I get the weight over my head fine. Is this normal or could I be doing something wrong? My stats: Male, 80kg, OHP 3x5 with 52.5kg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree on both counts. He's insufferable and \**seems*\* quite knowledgeable.  #8203; The problem with Loyd is that he takes everything face-value and draws very broad and far reaching conclusions based of his own very limited experience (eg: his very problematic view on global warming)  #8203; In this case he is drawing conlusions about duelling with spears in the ancient and medieval world on a few re-enactment battles he fought and what he experienced in them.  #8203; I'm no expert either so I'll leave it to the real experts to convince you. Look up HEMA (Historacal European Martial Arts) Spear Duel and tell me how Loyd would fare with his sword (and shield). I'll leave it at this ;-)</TEXT>
