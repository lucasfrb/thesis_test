    <TEXT>Hey there! What school are you going to? We wish you luck with the essay. Anyways to the matter: It is impossible to predict at this point how much a Xarelto lawsuit will settle for since each case is being filed as an individual personal injury lawsuit and the circumstances of these lawsuits vary greatly from one to the other. While I cannot give you an estimate on how much Xarelto lawsuit settlement amounts are but for the previous year its possible that I can gather some information from month-to-month. A litigation involving a similar blood thinner was recently settled. Boehringer Ingelheim settled 4,000 lawsuits, filed in relation to its own blood thinner drug Pradaxa, for $650 million. The Xarelto lawsuit settlements will vary because each lawsuit will contain a variety of economic and non-economic damages. Things such as treatment costs, medical expenses, long-term care, loss of earnings, loss of future income claims, and funeral and burial expenses all fall under the category of economic damages. Non-economic damages consist of things such as pain and suffering for the injuries or the pain and suffering caused by losing a loved one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes; there are no interactions between, or contraindications with, Xarelto and acetaminophen. If you do experience any side effects you should go and consult with your doctor. Hopefully, someone who is taking Tylenol with Xarelto will soon submit their experiences on this page.</TEXT>

This would, in the end, be $80,000 per person. Of course this is just an example. Who knows how much settlement funds will be available this year. Simply contact your lawyer for such information (if they will disclose it).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They want to get rid of the "trading" meaning you sending the cash then the guy sending the item (since most games work that way). Lots of people scam lets say with paypal to ask for a chargeback as their TOS against digital items is well ... most of the time it goes into the favor of the buyer (you see where I am going)? By trading ENJ I think both would be instant... You getting ENJ and him getting the item at the same time? (its how I think it would work).

    <DATE>2018-10-12 23:31:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I get wierd stuttering/micro stuttering when am playing in 1070/SLI with the newest drivers. Probably can forget about getting an optimized SLI profile. Disabling 2nd GFX runs smoothly on 4k with almost everything to max except res slider to 85% So I guess if you experience same issue as me and have SLI, try turning 1 GFX off.</TEXT>

You should also disable driver signature enforcement (check google) when you next start up PC from safemode. Install the above drivers (modded but quadro are really really good) + Physix then restart. Once it boots back up, go to SLI configuration on nvidia CP and enable it there (was disabled at my end when I installed). Obviously set other things in 3D settings like high performance mode ... report back.  #8203; If you want the newset nvidia drivers but modded then this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/XtremeG/comments/9npfsc/xg\_41634\_desktop\_win10\_x64/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XtremeG/comments/9npfsc/xg_41634_desktop_win10_x64/) Do the same steps with original if you don't want modded ones except driver signature enforcment doesnt need to be disabled.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-20 16:32:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I just get this wierd hitching (in zombies and MP) when I use render 4k at 100 resolution scale. I get about 100FPS average but the game is "freezing/hitching" constantly feels like micro stutter but worse. Dropping down my res scale to 75 makes the game smooth even though I only gain about 20 fps more in most areas.  #8203; Anybody else experiencing this? Same goes with single GPU where I run avg 70 fps (which I limit to 60) and I still get this not smooth gameplay. If I drop the res scale to 75 also on single GPU and limit FPS to 60 it feels ways smoother.</TEXT>

I would be making some scenes to help with 3D animation projects as it seems you could have a scene placed faster in creative mode in Minecraft rather than doing it in 3DMax and can easily record with some game recording software and just create rigs and animate them in the 3D program. As long as it will have 30fps (am sure it will be more) it should be fine :D New COD looks interesting since RTX are only used on shadows.

    <TEXT>Summary: Textures doesn't seem to load and everything is bright as hell. I guess I shouldn't be complaining as I can see everything indoors when it happens but yeah its annoying as graphics slowly degrade and I get cubed textures at the end of the match. This started with S2 update.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you have micron memory or samsung? I think the models that were with Samsung got changed a bit as the board changed (its what also alphacool said). I am actually running this at 2160mhz now so its not bad and I've gotten it for about 860 #8364; which was a really good deal at the time (about a year ago). I don't have any coil whine though I did get it yesterday when I flashed the Galax bios to try it out (it was insane). Switching back to my updated bios worked just fine and there is no more coil whine. [https://www33.zippyshare.com/v/P4mzkC0u/file.html](https://www33.zippyshare.com/v/P4mzkC0u/file.html) My bios file incase you wanna try or try updating it first via the tool found on palit website. Luckily, the shop that I bought it in said I could return it when repasting and they would've done the RMA but it wasn't needed since its working just fine on water now. Do note that running this card on full load at 80C is normal. Its just the way this card works and can't be compared with the 1000 series or lower.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think 120mm rad should be fine to drop the temps to about 55 under load and have the card OCed (depends on card lottery as well). Are you running any OC on the card because I am. I have vents set to 85% on the rad and I can't hear them through headset when I game. 36% (inaudiable) once I am not doing much (photoshop, 3D design etc). I will be switching to the silent wings 3 from bequiet as those vents are practically inaudiable at RPMs (1000+) for my rad. Did you also have coil whine when having stock cooler on?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coil whine could have gotten worse when you've switched to water (can happen) so it might be that and not you changing it to 3700x. I doubt remounting the plate would fix this issue but might be worth giving it a try. Which vent do you have on your rad?</TEXT>
