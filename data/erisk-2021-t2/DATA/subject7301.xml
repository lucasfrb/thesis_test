    <TITLE>Speed Clear: Odin 6 Turns All Missions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-25 14:46:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Full Clear**: https://youtu.be/XJiya4xHRgk **Battle Summary**: An intense battle because as the fight drags out and as his HP drops, Odin becomes more dangerous. The idea here is to complete your esper mission as fast as possible and chip him down to almost 40% as you go along. Once you near 40%, you **have to** kill him. The moment you cross that threshold, there's no turning back - he'll start mitigating damage increasingly with each turn and eventually, **if you can't kill him**, [**he'll kill you**](/tg). Every 3 turns, he'll "Summon Einherjar", which means on his next turn, he will use a magical AoE which he'll combo with "Obliteration". Make sure that your mitigation is up and everyone is at full health. Maintain cover/provoke at all times on your tank too as he is the lifeline of the team. He dies, everyone dies. In my case, I used a full evade Wilhelm. Aim for Paralysis/Blind immunity because he can inflict those ailments. **Turn Summary**: Turn|[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)|[Zargabaath](#I/Icons/u8059/)|[CG Fina](#I/Icons/u815/)|[CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)|[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)| --:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| 1|Cover|Rejuvenate Fina|Shining Cheer|"Entrust" Hyoh 1|Ruthless Blade x2|Ruthless Blade x2| 2|Provoke|CD buff|Reraise self + Wilhelm|"Entrust" Hyoh 2|Ruthless Blade x2|Ruthless Blade x2| 3|Cover|Rejuvenate Fina + Wilhelm|Reraise Zarg + Curaja|DEF debuff|Servant of the Blade x2|Volt Blade + Servant of the Blade| 4|Provoke|Dispel|LB|DEF debuff|Servant of the Blade x2|Servant of the Blade x2| 5|Cover|LB|Free turn|Evoke Lakshmi|CD buff|CD buff| 6|-|-|-|LB debuff|LB|LB| Equipment shown at the end of the video.

    <TITLE>The Great Count Challenge: All Missions - 8 Turns</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-26 08:46:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Full Clear Video**: https://youtu.be/XKD85cmGZf0 **Battle Summary** Urgh.. Hasiko 2.0. You get [**MP drained**](/gt) AND [**Charmed**](/tt) **as a pre-emptive strike** and multiple times along the way so it's rather RNG on how you start the fight out. Best to bring along Lakshmi for Charm Protection and have a way to regenerate MP. For me, I used Awakened Rain's Scarlet Healing to do the job. I had full status ailment for my team so there might be others to watch out for. Hyoh's Ruthless Blade comes in handy to generate LS and ES. I only used single cast for the first few turns to avoid killing the Count too quickly. Thereafter, it was a matter of slowing working back to an operational team to kill him off. **Turn Summary**: Turn|[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)|[Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/)|[CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)|[CG Fina](#I/Icons/u815/)|[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)| --:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| 1|(Charmed)|Guard|Auto attack|Auto attack|Auto attack|Auto attack| 2|(Dead)|Auto attack|(Dead)|Revive All|Auto attack|(Dead)| 3|Provoke|Scarlet Healing|(Charmed)|Revive All|(Dead)|(Dead)| 4|DEF/SPR buff|Magic Cover|ATK/MAG debuff|Shining Cheer|Ruthless Blade|Ruthless Blade| 5|Guard|CD Purification|MAG debuff|Curaja + team Dispelga|Ruthless Blade|Ruthless Blade| 6|(Dead)|Scarlet Healing|(Charmed)|Revive Wilhelm + Curaja|Ruthless Blade|Ruthless Blade| 7|Provoke|Scarlet Healing|(Charmed)|MP rege|Ruthless Blade|Ruthless Blade| 8|Evoke Esper|-|DEF debuff|Curaja + team Dispelga|Flame Blade + Servant of the Blade|Servant of the Blade x2| Hope this helps.

Once this batch is done, we should technically start getting some awakenings for the CG units in Batch 5 (hopefully).

So we may not get him so soon. The same goes for [**Dark Espers II**](/tt), which was released with [**FFX Jecht/Auron**](/tt) banner. A good hunch would be another GLEX trial during this interim; but again, Gumi might be crazy enough to throw these trials in. Who knows? **Espers**: Leviathan 3 #9733; will be next. --- # Possible Collabs  #8211; NIER Re-run /Secret of Mana/ Tomb Raider Re-run Alright, the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs. We got VP-ed (with GLEX nerfs to the banners)! /s Looking ahead, we #8217;re still camping for that Nier re-run. JP got theirs month before last which featured 7 #9733; 2B and A2. Note that JP's A2 is entirely different from GL's. Units on the banner: [2B](#I/Icons/u774/) 2B (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Katana** (+130 ATK +20% MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+40% ATK w/ Katana, Sword and/or Spear  amp; +50% Mag/Phys Dmg vs Humans  amp; Grant: ST 40% Death or ST 550% 1 Hit Thunder Phys Damage) Summary: 2B gets an insane ATK buff kit at 7 #9733; including 100% TDH, 50% TDW and gains several new skills which has **huge** modifiers which stack. She also comes with a 100% thunder imperil too! More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/774?st=JNQLRXMQ amp;sh=7c0014b7) --- [A2](#I/Icons/u8062/) A2 (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **2-handed Greatsword** (+143 ATK, +20% DEF, Damage Variance: 1x~1.6x)  amp; Grant: AoE 450% 1 Hit Phys Damage) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+80% ATK w/ Greatsword  amp; +50% Phys/Mag Damage vs Machines) Summary: Has innate 150% TDH, W-cast, chains with **AT family**, innate DW and 50% TDW. A2 is also able to unlock T-cast through her CD skill. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1388?st=JNQLUNXM amp;sh=e8834c38). --- [9S](#I/Icons/u776/) 9S **TMR**: **Accessory** (+8 DEF +8 SPR, Grants: AoE HoT 3000 Base + 9x Mod over three turns, 100% Treasure Hunter, AoE 2 Turns 40% Phys Mitigation, AoE 8 Hits 300% Phys) Summary: **Excellent TMR** obviously, he's also able to provide imperil/stat debuffs. --- [Eve](#I/Icons/u8065/) Eve **TMR**: **Materia** (+30% ATK  amp; +110% ATK/DEF Buff when HP below 80%) Summary: TMR fodder. --- [21O](#I/Icons/u782/) 21O **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% HP/SPR  amp; 30% Chance to counter Phys/Mag with Self 800 Base + 1x Mod Heal) Summary: **Superb TMR** that is great on tanks/support/healers. --- NIER re-run event in JP had its own step-up banner: * Step 1: 5,000 Lapis, 1x "Nier Ticket"  amp; Guaranteed 9S * Step 2: 5,000 Lapis, 1x "Nier Ticket"  amp; A2/2B rates x1.5 * Step 3: 5,000 Lapis, 1x "Nier Ticket"  amp; Guaranteed A2 or 2B at random Similar to the CG event banner in GL, players get one  #8220;NIER Ticket #8221; for every 10+1. Exchange 5 for a guaranteed 2B/A2. Overall, this is one of the most wanted collab re-runs in GL. It #8217;s really great that they made a comeback. It has awesome units and long shelf life TMRs even to this day! --- The second possibility is Secret of Mana which got a full PC version remake in February this year. Possible? Perhaps. Just for topic #8217;s sake, here are the units on the banner: [Randi](#I/Icons/u330/) Randi (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **1-handed Sword** (+101 ATK +8 DEF/MAG/SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% ATK, +30% Esper Stats  amp; +15% HP/MP w/ Swords) **Summary**: An extremely versatile physical DR chainer capable of wielding [Fixed Dice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNZZ4wRskhc) with multiple elemental imbues in his kit. Randi has 100% DH as part of his trust ability and unlocks W-ability for his skills at maxed 7 #9733;. [Mana Blade Randi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w52ii2ysetw amp;t=66s) --- [Flammie](#I/Icons/u1149/) Flammie (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+50 ATK  amp; +20% HP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% ATK  amp; +50% Phys Dmg vs Beast/Spirit/Undead) **Summary**: Timed jumper capable of imbuing himself with several elements. Flammie has a total of 150% TDH (100% TDH from 6 #9733; kit + 50% TDH from trust ability). He can also imperil for 100% wind/light. --- [Riesz](#I/Icons/u804/) Riesz (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Helmet** (+52 DEF +40 SPR +15% HP/MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+80% ATK  amp; +20% DEF/MAG/SPR w/ Spears) **Summary**: Timed jumper with 100% TDH from trust ability. Riesz has two powerful utility CD skills  #8211; the first is a 150% full buff with 2k HP barrier and the second is a 70% full break with 100% light/dark imperil. --- [Hawkeye](#I/Icons/u806/) Hawkeye (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Dagger** (+105 ATK +70 MAG +20% MP +100% LB Fill Rate) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% ATK/MAG  amp; +20% EQ ATK/MAG (TDW) when dual wielding) **Summary**: Hybrid damage dealer with a 74% full break as a CD skill and 79% LB full break (with Trust Ability upgrade). --- [Kevin](#I/Icons/u808/) Kevin (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK w/ Knuckle  amp; +30% ATK w/ Clothes) [STMR](/#label-red): **Knuckle** (+172 ATK  amp; Dark Element) **Summary**: His kit is pretty bad for a 5 #9733; unit. He can provide 200% LB fill rate for an ally and serve as a decent finisher with his LB which comes with 100% dark imperil. --- [Primm](#I/Icons/u332/) Primm **TMR**: **Materia** (+30% MP +10% MAG/SPR) **Summary**: Hybrid damage dealer that covers ice, thunder, earth, fire and light elements. --- [Carlie](#I/Icons/u810/) Carlie **TMR**: **Materia** (+20% DEF/SPR/HP  amp; +10% Light Resists) **Summary**: Horrible 4 #9733; kit. And as for her TMR, you #8217;re way better off with Patriotic Recall. --- [Popoi](#I/Icons/u335/) Popoi **TMR**: **Materia** (+25% MAG +5% MP) **Summary**: PPD. --- SoM has its own step-up banners too. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7y57o1/jp_maintenance_som_raid_7_awakenings_more_219/). Seeing what GL did with the VP banner, I wouldn #8217;t get my hopes up high that the rainbow units obtained will be limited to SoM featured. * Step 1: 500 Lapis, 1 Pull, 1.5x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 2: 1000 Lapis, 2 Pulls, 5% Trust Moogle * Step 3: 1500 Lapis, 4 Pulls, 2x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 4: 3000 Lapis, 6 Pulls, 10% Trust Moogle * Step 5: 5000 Lapis, 11 Pulls, 5x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 6: 500 Lapis, 1 Pull, 3x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 7: 1000 Lapis, 2 Pulls, 5% Trust Moogle * Step 8: 1500 Lapis, 4 Pulls, 5x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 9: 3000 Lapis, 6 Pulls, 10% Trust Moogle * Step 10: 5000 Lapis, 11 Pulls, 1x Guaranteed Featured 5 #9733; Overall, the 5 #9733; units seem really good with the exception of Kevin. As for the rest of the units #8230;well, I #8217;ll leave them to /u/TomAto314 when the time comes. ( #65507; #9661; #65507;) #12446; --- The third possibility is a return of Tomb Raider. Shadow of the Tomb Raider was released on Sep 14th which could hint at a collab rerun featuring 7 #9733; Lara Croft as part of its event. That sums it up for the collab corner. As always, feel free to insert your speculations in the comments! --- #Upcoming Hype  #8211; December **FF Type 0** Event ft: [Kurasame, Machina, Deuce, Cater](/gt) [Kurasame](#I/Icons/u1162/)[Machina](#I/Icons/u1159/)[Deuce](#I/Icons/u1165/)[Cater](#I/Icons/u1168/) **Sieghart** Story Event ft: [Wait.... was it Sieghard?...

    <TEXT>**Full Clear Video**: https://youtu.be/sQskgPiNMiw --- Unit | Role ---|----| [Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/) | Magical cover tank [Zargabaath](#I/Icons/u8059/) | Buffer [CG Citra](#I/Icons/u1086/) | Esper Mission [CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/) | Chainers --- **Strategy**: Real easy fight if you have a magic tank with 100% fire/thunder/ice/light/dark resistance as those are the elemental damage that the boss does. For me, I used Awakened Rain as the main provoke and cover. Citra was on esper mission and Zargabaath basically buffed everyone. Hyohs were on standby to nuke the boss once the esper mission was completed. **Alchemy Tome** that's granted by the boss must be used [**before**](/tg) **the 60% HP threshold** else he will amplify his own damage.

    <TITLE>Elephim Story Event: Bonus Stage Full Missions Clear</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-09 10:27:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full Clear + Equipment Video: https://youtu.be/cbT1hwgx95g --- Unit | Role ---|---| [Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/) | MVP, Magical cover tank with multiple resistance gear [CG Citra](#I/Icons/u1086/) | Esper missions [Ramza](#I/Icons/u259/) | Double breaker / HP Barrier [Ayaka](#I/Icons/u651/) | Healer/ HP Barrier [CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)| Thunder chainers with Diabolos Esper for Demon killers **Strategy**: The fight consists of 3 parts - Bomb Lv 99, White Dragon and Greater Demon Lv 99. **Bomb Lv 99** First Wave: 6 bombs. Relatively straight forward and can be killed by chaining 2 Hyohs using Ruthless Blade. Ramza was equipped with ice/water weapon for the mission. Citra charged up the esper bar ever so slightly even though it wasn't really needed because the chaining would have generated enough esper orbs to fill the entire gauge. **White Dragon** White Dragon opens the fight with a pre-emptive strike, causing everyone's HP to dip till its very last drop. Nothing a good heal can't fix. Ramza broke his DEF/SPR and the 2 Hyohs again, chained it to death with Citra capping the kill with an esper for the mission. Done. **Greater Demon Lv 99** The skill set of this boss follows almost exactly what you see [here](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Scorn_of_the_Surging_Menace). This is where it depends on what elemental gears you have or elemental buffs that you can cast. Greater Demon predominantly hits you with Tornado, Flood, Quake and Flare. These spells lowers your resistance to wind, earth, thunder and water by **30%** respectively. My Awakened Rain had 175% [**wind**](/ga), 155% [**earth**](/cc), 125% [**thunder**](/stt) and 105% [**water**](/gt) resistance so he was almost invincible to all the magic attacks. The only damage I sustained was from his physical ST and AoE attacks which hurt quite a fair bit on turns where he dispels your ATK/MAG breaks. Ayaka maintained the HP barriers and heals while Citra charges up the esper gauge once again for the mission and Rain covered the magical AoEs. Ramza maintained the breaks on the boss and I had the Hyohs turtle until I was ready to finish the fight. Once the esper gauge was full, I cast Lakshmi to heal everyone and had Citra dual cast Holy for the mission while using Rain and the 2 Hyohs to triple LB nuke. **Note**: You'll probably need to gear yourselves with some level of status immunity because the last boss inflicts several kinds of it. All of my units were immune to all ailments.</TEXT>

We should technically be done by January 2019. Feel free to speculate on what units you think would be in the next batch and what upgrades you would like to see! --- #Banner 1  #8211; FF7 GODAMN BAMBOOZLED..! Type 0 and FF7 was swapped! Well, here we are again: [Vincent](#I/Icons/u1113/) Vincent (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+60% ATK/-30% SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **2-handed Gun** (+175 ATK, +70% Accuracy, 1.3x~1.7x Dmg Var) **Summary**: Cold, dark and always brooding. He can be either a finisher or chainer. Vincent also has buffs that increase killer vs machine/beasts. [Omega? What Omega?](https://youtu.be/yipncmax_cc) --- [Tifa](#I/Icons/u1110/) Tifa (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK when equipped with Knuckle  amp; +30% ATK when equipped with Hat) [STMR](/#label-red): **Knuckle** (+170 ATK Knuckle, Gain 3 LS per Turn) **Summary**: A fan favorite for obvious reasons, Tifa comes with innate dual wield and chains with the DR family and has a 100% water imperil and 74% DEF debuff in her LB. [D-D-D-Dolphins!](https://youtu.be/7JUB1PuiW1Y) --- [Barret](#I/Icons/u1116/) Barret **TMR**: **1-handed Gun** (+107 ATK +98 MAG +10% MP Gun) **Summary**: [ORA ORA ORA ORA!!](https://youtu.be/D-BScR2QymA?t=144) Apart from that godforsaken sprite, he #8217;s actually quite useful. --- [Cait Sith](#I/Icons/u1119/) Caith Sith **TMR**: **1-handed Instrument** (+22 ATK +95 MAG +44 SPR) **Summary**: Has RNG fixed damage attacks. --- ~~No step-up was offered whatsoever in JP.~~ FFVII had its own step-up in [JP] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7ua8gt/jp_final_fantasy_7_3_pickup_thread_21_214/) at 25k Lapis with a guaranteed Tifa/Vincent on the last step. (Thanks u/khennlionhart for pointing that out!) All the units here are great for nostalgic pickups but are otherwise aren #8217;t used anywhere else except for their TMR/STMR. --- # Banner 2  #8211; Sieghart Story Event [CG Sieghart](#I/Icons/u1171/) Sieghart (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+20% DEF/SPR/+30% HP, LB Fill Rate +50%, +30% Earth Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Heavy Shield** (+85 DEF, +30% HP, +80% Earth Resist) **Summary**: It #8217;s the battle of beef! Wagyu Kobe in its all marbling *beauty* versus Filet Mignon with its thick and full ~~moustache~~ succulence! Sieghart #8217;s a top tier staple when it comes to cover duty. He has both physical and magical covers with chances of charming the enemy. Note that his magical cover lasts 2 turns and has a 3 turn cooldown though. He also has innate 50% draw and 100% resistance to charm. If you #8217;re still rocking with WoL , it #8217;s your time to **pull**! He is **very future proof**. --- [Dietlinde](#I/Icons/u1174/) Dietlinde **TMR**: **Materia** (+50% ATK with Gun) **Summary**: Insane [**84% DEF**](/tg) debuff in LB. Absolute gibberish if the enemy is immune to DEF breaks. Nice TMR if you #8217;re are planning to pull for heavy gun users like Vincent. --- [Theobalt](#I/Icons/u1177/) Theobalt **TMR**: **Whip** (+62 ATK, +125 MAG) **Summary**: Flood chainer. Has 200% High Tide team buff (except self) in LB. Pretty neat TMR for units Barbariccia and Seabreeze Dark Fina. --- [Kanon](#I/Icons/u1180/) Kanon **TMR**: **Sword** (+105 ATK, Fire Elemental  amp; Enables Dual-Wield of Swords) **Summary**: Decent TMR but locks you to Swords just like Aqua Blade. --- Sieghart is on the [standard 11k lapis](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/836g5k/jp_story_event_19_pickup_megathread_39319/) one-time step-up banner with 5x chances of getting him on the last step. --- #Banner 3- Hess Banner (Yuraisha, Franis, Ishil) [Yuraisha](#I/Icons/u1185/) Yuraisha (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% SPR, +20% MP  amp; Auto-Protect/Auto-Shell) [STMR](/#label-red): **Hat** (+34 DEF, +95 SPR, +30% HP  amp; Auto-Regen) **Summary**: The mother of all buffers is here. Yuraisha offers a ton of buffs, killer boosts, elemental resistances and can even chain with the Quake family. Move aside Nichol, ol #8217; grandma is here! --- [Franis](#I/Icons/u1188/) Franis **TMR**: **Accessory** (+40 ATK, +3 DEF, +10% HP  amp; Blind Immunity) **Summary**: Nothing much except a neat TMR. --- [Ishil](#I/Icons/u1191/) Ishil **TMR**: **Hat** (+20 ATK/SPR  amp; +50% Silence Resist) **Summary**: An odd TMR but if anything else, it #8217;s PPD. --- Yuraisha is a great pickup if you don #8217;t have Nichol or Zargabaath. She #8217;s a **major upgrade** if you #8217;re still using units like Soleil for buffs. The two children of Hess are TMR grab-and-go. --- #Trials  amp; Espers For Chamber of Arms: Trial #10 [Dabii](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7qsn0w/jp_12_weapons_trial_10_dabii/) For Chamber of the Indignant: [Scorn of Gilgamesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8oz7xm/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_gilgamesh/) For Chamber of the Fallen: Trial #18 [Dark Espers II  #8211; Shiva  amp; Golem](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8filpq/jp_trial_18_dark_espers_ii_dark_shiva_dark_golem/) **Note**: We won't be seeing Scorn of Gilgamesh until we get the mixer system, since one of the missions give Mixer Coins. The English translation for Gilgamesh's abilities isn't in the game files yet (as of the last maintenance), while trials like Warden Welter (the last 10 man) already have their English skill names in the files. (Thanks /u/CottonC_3939) For espers, Alexander 3 #9733;. --- # Possible Collabs  #8211; Secret of Mana/ Xenogears / Just Cause 3 Alright, the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs. JP got SoM right after Elephim #8217;s Story Event. BUT in GL, we got NIER instead! ANOTHER SWAP! ###Secret of Mana Banner### [Randi](#I/Icons/u330/) (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **1-handed Sword** (+101 ATK +8 DEF/MAG/SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% ATK, +30% Esper Stats  amp; +15% HP/MP w/ Swords) **Summary**: An extremely versatile physical DR chainer capable of wielding Fixed Dice with multiple elemental imbues in his kit. Randi has 100% TDH as part of his trust ability and unlocks W-ability for his skills at maxed 7 #9733;. --- [Flammie](#I/Icons/u1149/) (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+50 ATK  amp; +20% HP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% ATK  amp; +50% Phys Dmg vs Beast/Spirit/Undead) **Summary**: Timed jumper capable of imbuing herself with several elements. Flammie has a total of 150% TDH (100% TDH from 6 #9733; kit + 50% TDH from trust ability). She can also imperil for 100% wind/light. --- [Riesz](#I/Icons/u804/) (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Helmet** (+52 DEF +40 SPR +15% HP/MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+80% ATK  amp; +20% DEF/MAG/SPR w/ Spears) **Summary**: Timed jumper with 100% TDH from trust ability. Riesz has two powerful utility CD skills  #8211; the first is a 150% full buff with 2k HP barrier and the second is a 70% full break with 100% light/dark imperil. --- [Hawkeye](#I/Icons/u806/) (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Dagger** (+105 ATK +70 MAG +20% MP +100% LB Fill Rate) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% ATK/MAG  amp; +20% EQ ATK/MAG (TDW) when dual wielding) **Summary**: Hybrid damage dealer with a 74% full break as a CD skill and 79% LB full break (with Trust Ability upgrade). --- [Kevin](#I/Icons/u808/) (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK w/ Knuckle  amp; +30% ATK w/ Clothes) [STMR](/#label-red): **Knuckle** (+172 ATK  amp; Dark Element) **Summary**: His kit is pretty bad for a 5 #9733; unit. He can provide 200% LB fill rate for an ally and serve as a decent finisher with his LB which comes with 100% dark imperil. --- [Primm](#I/Icons/u332/) **TMR**: **Materia** (+30% MP +10% MAG/SPR) **Summary**: Hybrid damage dealer that covers ice, thunder, earth, fire and light elements. --- [Carlie](#I/Icons/u810/) **TMR**: **Materia** (+20% DEF/SPR/HP  amp; +10% Light Resists) **Summary**: Horrible 4 #9733; kit. And as for her TMR, you #8217;re way better off with Patriotic Recall. --- [Popoi](#I/Icons/u335/) **TMR**: **Materia** (+25% MAG +5% MP) **Summary**: Ultimate post pull depression. --- SoM has its own step-up banners too. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7y57o1/jp_maintenance_som_raid_7_awakenings_more_219/). Seeing what GL did with the VP banner, I wouldn #8217;t get my hopes up high that the rainbow units obtained will be limited to SoM featured ones. * Step 1: 500 Lapis, 1 Pull, 1.5x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 2: 1000 Lapis, 2 Pulls, 5% Trust Moogle * Step 3: 1500 Lapis, 4 Pulls, 2x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 4: 3000 Lapis, 6 Pulls, 10% Trust Moogle * Step 5: 5000 Lapis, 11 Pulls, 5x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 6: 500 Lapis, 1 Pull, 3x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 7: 1000 Lapis, 2 Pulls, 5% Trust Moogle * Step 8: 1500 Lapis, 4 Pulls, 5x 5 #9733; Rates of Featured 5 #9733; * Step 9: 3000 Lapis, 6 Pulls, 10% Trust Moogle * Step 10: 5000 Lapis, 11 Pulls, 1x Guaranteed Featured 5 #9733; Overall, the 5 #9733; units seem really good with the exception of Kevin. As for the rest of the units #8230;well, you know how it goes. --- ###Xenogears### Xenogears collab is split into two parts. Part I consists of Fei, Elly and Bart. Part II has Citan and Maria.

Since Rico was a confirmed 7 #9733;, we should be getting another JC collab some time in December. (Thanks /u/LewdisGewd). This might conflict with SoM depending on what Gumi does. So keep your eyes peeled! --- #TomAto #8217;s Longshot Collab! I was watching the daily ads and saw one for the hit(?) Fox show: 911. Makes perfect sense as FF fans love police procedural dramas.

Having a magic tank with 100% fire/water/wind/earth will really trivialize the fight since the boss does not debuff your elements.

Wilhelm had full evade gears to laugh at the ST physical attacks. The only real damage I was taking was from the AoE physical, which when combined with Zarg's mitigation and Lid's breaks, were minimal. Zarg also provided the team with anti-break resistance at the start of the battle so the team's stats remained healthy. The boss mainly inflicts paralyze/poison/stop ailments. Almost everyone was immune to all status inflictions except Stop, which was resisted only by Zarg, Rain and Ayaka. You could use Lakshmi's Stop Protection to nullify it as well. I used Ayaka to remove it. I used a combination of 2 elemental chainers - primarily Fire and secondary Ice. Raegen/Hyoh as fire chainers and Fryevia/Shadow Lord as ice chainers. You could also opt for a pair of Holy Chainers for the entire battle since it isn't resisted. From 89-79%, the boss has an innate weakness of -1000% ice so I switched out for the ice chainers during this threshold to capitalize on this. From 49% onwards, the boss has an innate weakness of -1000% fire; using Raegen and Hyoh allowed me to make short work of it. At 29%, the boss uses Mirage, in which case I used Fryevia to attack it to remove the mirage before using Lid's LB to break, Raegen's LB to imperil and Hyoh + Rain to chain and conclude the fight. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

Having full status ailments for my entire team knocked out a potential problem. Next, the pre-emptive MP drain. [**This is where you can use an item like Greater Scroll of Recovery**](/gt). I used 2 scrolls with both Hyohs so I regained an instant 200 MP. The boss also debuffs itself for -300% light/dark resistance when you kill the adds. It also triggers a very powerful AoE nuke at the same time which was covered by Rain who had Reraise on him although Rain was barely scathed lol. I used eRamza as a double breaker since no LBs was one of the mission requirements. His HP barrier also came in handy in tanking some of the damage. Once the adds die, chaining with eRamza's breaks nuked it instantly. Done in 3 Turns! Surprisingly straight forward.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Full Clear All Missions - Leviathan 3 #9733;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-29 12:04:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Full Video**: https://youtu.be/nmWD2v1a4BM --- **Battle Summary** [**Foreword**](/tg): [Leviathan hits like a fully loaded train!](/gt) There are 2 ways to do this - either using a magic tank with 130% water and 100% ice resist or using a physical tank with everyone's resistance post-buff at 130% water and 100% ice resist. I opted for the former because I couldn't find a friend Hyoh with the required elemental resistances. I ran with the following team: |Unit|Role|Gear :--|:--|:--| [Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/)|Magic Tank|135% [**Ice**](/ct)/155% [**Water**](/gt) Resist| |[Zargabaath](#I/Icons/u8059/)|Buffer|High HP/MP + Ramuh Esper for Mission| |[CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)|Breaker|HP+ LB Fill rate + Alexander Esper for Mission| [Ayaka](#I/Icons/u651/)|Healer/HP Barrier|High HP/SPR |[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|Lightning Weapon Chainer|Full TDH + Aquan Killer| With my set up for Awakened Rain, he virtually took zero damage from the magic AoE and only sustained ST and AoE physical damage. He was also my provoke tank. Lid's the breaker I chose because she was the best I had in terms of break value. She was also the **most squishy** in the entire team. She had to stay alive to maintain the debuffs so I had reraise on her constantly. Zargabaath MVP here. His damage mitigation really helps **a ton** in keeping everyone alive during the turns where Leviathan uses 2 AoE physicals. I couldn't have done the run without him. Ayaka's role here is to maintain heal, reraise and HP barriers. The barriers helped in beefing up the team. The chainers are Hyoh with Lightning weapons. I sacrificed some ATK for Syldra's Protection (Aqua/Dragon killer) for more bonus damage since Leviathan's an Aquan Race. Because I could not afford to take any snort during the battle, I had to dispel and reapply breaks on Leviathan every turn I wanted to attack. I also didn't push below the 80% threshold mark because things will start getting messy with imbue and stop shenanigans. It also took a while to generate the esper orbs and to find the right setup of skills to nuke him. The gist of the battle is basically to turtle and complete the missions then push to slightly above 80% HP and nuke him from there. 2 Hyohs with Lightning weapons worked for me. I didn't expect the triple cast with 200% ATK buff using Phantom Blade and Servant of the Blade to nuke him from ~80% HP so I had A.Rain's LB on standby for the mission. The fight could have been shorter but I played it super safe so it took a little longer than I expected. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Full Clear All Missions: Sieghard Bonus Stage</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-07 10:15:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Full Video** (equipment at the end): https://youtu.be/XLzCjxO_AEU --- **Battle Summary**: The battle consists of 3 parts - Demon Chimera, Metal Gigantuar and Giga Rat + Rat Minions These are the monsters' info: [Libra](https://altema.jp/ffbe/kareinarujikuharutoextra). You'll notice that none of them have any form of resistances to wind element. This doesn't mean you should go in recklessly with a full-on wind damage team! You'll have to be extra careful at the last stage when facing the Giga Rat. You **cannot kill ANY of the minions**. If just **one of them dies**, the Giga rat will **retaliate** with a very powerful **AoE magic nuke** that will most probably wipe your team. --- **Team**: |Unit|Role|Gear|Status Immunity| :--|:--|:--|:--| |[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)|Provoke/Cover Tank| #8805;100% [**fire**](/tg)/[**thunder**](/stt)/[**water**](/gt)/[**wind**](/ga)/[**earth**](/cc)/[**dark**](/tt)|Full| |[CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)|Breaker|LB Gear/High HP/Wind Pod Chainer|Full| |[Ayaka](#I/Icons/u651/)|Healer|High HP/SPR/Wind Pod Chainer|Full| |[Fire Veritas](#I/Icons/u575/)|Finisher|DW Neutral Weapons + 100% Beast Killer|Full| |[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|Fire Weapon Chainer|Full TDH + 125% Beast Killer|Full (except companion) | --- **Demon Chimera** Demon Chimera has innate 300% fire/ice/lightning/light/dark resistances; making it vulnerable to water/wind/earth elements. It is also susceptible to sleep with a 20% resistance. It is immune to ATK/MAG break and can only be DEF/SPR broken. In this fight, I used a pair of wind Pod chainers - Ayaka and Lid with Flame Veritas as a finisher. FV is able to imbue himself with earth/wind elements and Ayaka had Leviathan Esper equipped so I had access to water magic to complete the missions. Basically I built up Lid's LB gauge with pod chaining and Wilhelm's counters. Thereafter I used FV's Full Charged Stomp to chop it down while using Lid's LB at the last second to complete the mission. --- **Metal Gigantuar** I kept reraise up on Wilhelm so that he's the only one that takes the hits and the rest of the team were unscathed. 2 Hyohs with LB nuked it easily. Just remember to kill it with magic for the mission. I'm not sure if the AI is vulnerable to Stop similar to the one in Scorn of the Marching Beasts. Feel free to test it out. --- **Giga Rat** Now for the final stage. This is where Wilhelm's unique build comes in super handy. (Thanks /u/Rozaliin for suggesting the build in the original [JP thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/836g51/jp_story_event_19_event_megathread_39319/)). With this build, the fight becomes a joke - provoke and 100% resistance to fire/thunder/water/wind/earth/dark elements allows you to take **zero damage** from the minion rats. He's also on physical cover duty. With 1000+ DEF, he was hardly scathed. The only real damage sustained was from the fixed AoE neutral elemental magic every 3 turns. Keep everyone healthy while maintaining breaks and you should be fine throughout the fight. As I mentioned earlier, do not kill any of the minion rats. Kill the Giga Rat first, then take on the minions. I basically turtled and maintained breaks until Hyoh and FV were ready to nuke - set up with Lid #8217;s LB break, 200% ATK buffs and triple cast Phantom Blade + Servant of the Blade + Red Inferno + Esper nuke killed the rat instantly while completing the mission at the same time. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

She was on expedition so I couldn't show her equips in the video lol --- **Team**: |Unit|Role|Gear| :--|:--|:--| |[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)|Provoke|Full Evade| |[Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/)|Magic Cover|High HP/SPR| |[CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)|Breaker|LB Gear| |[Ayaka](#I/Icons/u651/)|Healer/Reraiser|High HP/SPR| |[Fire Veritas](#I/Icons/u575/)|Finisher - Target Shaman|DW Neutral Elemental + Undead Killer| |[Light Veritas](#I/Icons/u600/)|Finisher - Dabih|High MAG + ATK + Man Eater| |[CG Sakura](#I/Icons/u793/)|Finisher - Target Cultist|High MAG + Man Eater| |[CG Citra](#I/Icons/u1086/)|Esper Fill|High MAG + SPR| |[Kid Rydia](#I/Icons/u875/)|Esper Fill + Tornado Chainer|High MAG + SPR| |[Barbariccia](#I/Icons/u1315/)|Tornado Chainer|High MAG| --- **Battle Summary**: This gist of this fight: Kill Summons  #8594; Complete missions  #8594; Push to threshold  #8594; Kill Dabih + Summons together. Dabih has 2 summons - both having an innate -100% weakness to non-elemental attacks and has 99% resistance to all elements. The [**Shaman**](/gt) is [weak to physical attacks](/gt) while the [**Cultist**](/tg) is [weak to magic attacks](/tg). Dabih himself has -100% weakness to ice/light, absorbs fire/dark and has 99% resistance to non-element attacks. Dabih and his summons are human/undead dual race. The team I used mainly comprised of 2 Tornado chainers to build up a long chain with DC Tornado while using Finishers to do most of the damage. In Phase 1, ~~using Lid's 50% DEF/SPR break~~ (my bad. summons are immune to DEF/SPR breaks) I killed both summons using Sakura and Fire Veritas to cap the tornado chain. Sakura's role is to damage Cultist while Fire Veritas is locked onto Shaman. Once both summons are down, Dabih won't perform any actions until you cross the threshold. Take this time to complete the missions. With Citra and Rydia, I was able to fill the esper gauge relatively quickly. If you have 7 #9733; Type-0 units, they can help you achieve the esper missions faster. I also had Fire Veritas ready up Power Stomp and Light Veritas with Saint Eraser on standby. Once the finishers are in place, I swapped them out before using Lid to debuff and used Citra to transition. At phase 2, Light Veritas targets Dabih, Sakura to Cultist and Fire Veritas to Shaman with capped tornado chains wipes them instantly. Take note that your physical chainers will be imbued with dark element on phase 2. So if you're using physical chainers, remember to dispel it away else you won't be able to do any damage to Dabih.</TEXT>

[**Note**](/tg): This table only **serves as a guide** and **Gumi may modify the updates at their own discretion.** The only thing **concrete** about this forecast is the **story events** that are released in consecutive succession and will highly unlikely see a random shift.

Do keep in mind if you intend to pull for them. #7 #9733; Awakening  #8211; Batch 6 [**GL Batch 5**](/gt):  gt;* Duke 7 #9733;, Yuna 7 #9733;,Lulu 7 #9733;, Aranea 7 #9733;,Prompto 7 #9733;, Kunshira 7 #9733;,Basch 7 #9733;, Lotus Mage Fina 7 #9733; We are left with the following: * Cloud * Sephiroth * Pure Summoner Rydia * Emperor Shera * Nameless Gunner Jake * Heavenly Technician Lid * Atoning Dragoon Kain * Maritime Strategist Nichol * Raegen * Jiraiya * Lila * Mediena And with this, we are down to the final 12 units! It took a whopping 5~6 months for everyone to get their 7 #9733; awakenings! --- #Banner 1  #8211; FF7 FF7 got pushed back yet again due to Christmas Events. On the other hand, it makes sense for Gumi to put it out before Kingdom Hearts if they intend to also release KH Cloud alongside Sora as part of the event. Also, it is highly unlikely that we'll get FF7 suddenly in the last week of December because the Mog Minister's currently the NPC to exchange GLEX units. So this'll probably pop early January. [Vincent](#I/Icons/u1113/) Vincent (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+60% ATK/-30% SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **2-handed Gun** (+175 ATK, +70% Accuracy, 1.3x~1.7x Dmg Var) **Summary**: Vincent can be either a finisher or chainer. If you chose to use him as the latter, he chains best with a dupe. He also has buffs that increase killer vs machine/beasts. His STMR will be superb for future finishers like Regina. --- [Tifa](#I/Icons/u1110/) Tifa (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK when equipped with Knuckle  amp; +30% ATK when equipped with Hat) [STMR](/#label-red): **Knuckle** (+170 ATK Knuckle, Gain 3 LS per Turn) **Summary**: A fan favorite for obvious reasons, Tifa comes with innate dual wield and chains with the DR family and has a 100% water imperil and 74% DEF debuff in her LB. --- [Barret](#I/Icons/u1116/) Barret **TMR**: **1-handed Gun** (+107 ATK +98 MAG +10% MP Gun) **Summary**: [GOMU GOMU NO #8230; GATALINGGGGG](https://youtu.be/D-BScR2QymA?t=144) Apart from that godforsaken sprite, he has his moments. --- [Cait Sith](#I/Icons/u1119/) Cait Sith **TMR**: **1-handed Instrument** (+22 ATK +95 MAG +44 SPR) **Summary**: Has RNG fixed damage attacks. --- FFVII had its own [step-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7ua8gt/jp_final_fantasy_7_3_pickup_thread_21_214/) in JP at 25k Lapis with a guaranteed Tifa/Vincent on the last step. All the units here are great for nostalgic pickups but are otherwise aren #8217;t used anywhere else except for their TMR/STMR. --- # Banner 2  #8211; Folka Story Event [CG Folka](#I/Icons/u1207/) Folka [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWZ0-8uGR1k/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (LB Fill Rate +50%  amp; +30% SPR/MP  amp; Recover 5% MP per Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **Staff** (+150 MP, +12 ATK, +166 SPR, +30% MP  amp; +50% Water Resist) **Summary**: Folka #8217;s specialities are MP recovery, status ailment protections, debuff removals and break resistance; Charm/Stop removals included. Her heals are also pretty good. She has a 75% water imperil and can also raise everyone #8217;s water resistance to 100%. Her enhancements grant her an additional 2k HP barrier with greater regen capabilities. She also has on-demand W-cast for her abilities. If you lack a 5 #9733; Healer in your roster, you might wanna consider pulling for her. --- [Yubel](#I/Icons/u1210/) Yubel **TMR**: **Materia** (+40% ATK  amp; +50% Physical Damage vs Plant) **Summary**: Chains with the Onion Slice family with attacks locked to either ice/dark element. His ice chaining skill raises fire resistance while his dark chaining skill raises light resistance for 70% values. --- [Kihana](#I/Icons/u1213/) Kihana **TMR**: **Accessory** (+45 SPR Accessory) **Summary**: This is one of those units where you have to use skill A to unlock skill B and use skill B to unlock a more potent version of skill B. At maxed potency, Kihana has access to 50% breaks and AoE 200% buffs. --- [Ekor](#I/Icons/u1216/) Ekor **TMR**: **Knuckle** (+125 ATK Water Element Knuckle) **Summary**: TMR is an instant-grab if you have pulled for Tifa. That #8217;s about it. --- Folka is on the standard 11k lapis one-time step-up banner with 5x chances of getting her on the last step. Banner info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8b5xzw/jp_story_event_20_pickup_megathread_410420/). On a whole the units on her banner are all pretty good especially their TMRs. For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Folka Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information: [Libra](https://altema.jp/ffbe/mizukagaminomikoextra). * 1st Wave: Ochu and Microchu (on super steroids) * 2nd Wave: Fire/Ice/Thunder/Water/Wind/Earth/Light/Dark Bomb Juniors (from Bomb Family Trial with 2x more HP) * 3rd Wave: Europa and Searchers (from Scorn of the Marching Beasts) Here #8217;s a refresh on Europa #8217;s AI (Impact/Shooting Mode etc) with /u/Sinzar_ #8217;s [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9p98hf/guide_marching_beasts_europa_two_methods/) --- #Banner 3- Hess Banner (Yuraisha, Franis, Ishil) [Yuraisha](#I/Icons/u1185/) Yuraisha (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% SPR, +20% MP  amp; Auto-Protect/Auto-Shell) [STMR](/#label-red): **Hat** (+34 DEF, +95 SPR, +30% HP  amp; Auto-Regen) **Summary**: Yuraisha offers a ton of buffs, killer boosts, elemental resistances and can even chain with the Quake family. --- [Franis](#I/Icons/u1188/) Franis **TMR**: **Accessory** (+40 ATK, +3 DEF, +10% HP  amp; Blind Immunity) **Summary**: Nothing much except a neat TMR. --- [Ishil](#I/Icons/u1191/) Ishil **TMR**: **Hat** (+20 ATK/SPR  amp; +50% Silence Resist) **Summary**: An odd TMR but if anything else, it #8217;s PPD. --- Yuraisha is a great pickup if you don #8217;t have Nichol or Zargabaath. She #8217;s a **major upgrade** if you #8217;re still using units like Soleil for buffs. The two children of Hess are TMR grab-and-go. --- #Trials  amp; Espers For Chamber of Arms: Trial #11 [Sadalsuud](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7xodzs/12_weapons_trial_11_sadalsuud/) For Chamber of the Indignant: [Scorn of Gilgamesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8oz7xm/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_gilgamesh/) For Chamber of the Fallen: Trial #18 [Dark Espers II  #8211; Shiva  amp; Golem](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8filpq/jp_trial_18_dark_espers_ii_dark_shiva_dark_golem/) Until we get the Mixer system, all **Reborn Trials** starting with Gilgamesh Kai will be put on hold because Trust Coins are given as rewards for certain missions. More info about the Mixer/ Trust Coin System can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8mzdqp/jp_maint_app_update_mixer_feature_story_update/). --- # Upcoming Collabs  #8211; Kingdom Hearts / Secret of Mana / Xenogears And we come to the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs! ###Kingdom Hearts### With the Fan Festa, [**Kingdom Hearts**](/tg) has been announced ~~in January~~ on December 28th! These were the units in JP: [Sora](#I/Icons/u1505/) Sora (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **1-handed Sword** (+160 ATK (Sora Exclusive Equipment), 30% TDW, +10% All Ele Resist, % MP /Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+70% ATK, +50% TDW) **Summary**: Sora chains with both DR and AT family and has a neutral elemental tornado chaining skill as well. He has innate 100% TDH and 50% TDW so he can be built both ways.

More details found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a7vs5u/jp_featured_banners_megathread_kingdom_hearts/). [**Note**](/tg): The units on this banner **might change** when it comes to GL so don't get your hopes too high up especially the 6x chain cap mods with TDW. --- ###Secret of Mana Banner### As of now, this collab is still remains a mystery. First of all, Seiken Densetsu 3 was never released outside of Japan. This means we **might never** get to see units like [Hawkeye](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/806), [Riesz](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/804) and [Kevin](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/808).

Flammie has a total of 150% TDH (100% TDH from 6 #9733; kit + 50% TDH from trust ability). He can also imperil for 100% wind/light. --- SoM has its own step-up banners too.

He mainly chains with himself and can chain with the AT family as well on his dark elemental skill. He has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. --- [Elly](#I/Icons/u1222/) Elly (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Rod** +32 ATK, +120 MAG, +20% MAG [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** +60% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resist, +60% MAG with Rod **Summary**: Elly is a [superb wind magical chainer](https://youtu.be/NVKhSfSCopo?t=169).

Has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. Citan also rocks a solid innate 150% TDH and is an [extremely powerful chainer to date.](https://youtu.be/ummtbDr4Juo?t=317) There #8217;s a solid breakdown of his kit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8l8i4d/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_citan/) --- [Maria](#I/Icons/u1264/) Maria (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+30 DEF, +52 MAG  amp; +40% Light Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG with Rod, +30% MP/MAG  amp; 5 LB/Turn) **Summary**: The ultimate [fister](https://youtu.be/yFL5rskgjQg?t=583).

We were supposed to get JC collab this month with JC4's release on Dec 4th but instead we got KP-ed.. Lara Croft and Star Ocean are also expected to make a comeback sometime next year but with the plethora of GLEX events happening such as CNY and Valentine's, I left them out of the forecast schedule to avoid over cluttering.

    <TITLE>Hyoh's Enhancements Predictions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-24 23:53:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Next month will probably be Hyoh's enhancements in JP. (**Edit**: Or at least I hope so seeing how Shatal got his recently) And as a proud owner of 7 #9733; Hyoh, I can't help wondering how he will be enhanced. Honestly speaking, I have my doubts whether he would even be able to go toe-to-toe with the top chainers now; seeing how monstrous the TDW meta is. #Hyoh's Main Cons / Possible Enhancements [**Lack of self-imbue**](/tg) Hyoh doesn't imbue himself. This isn't really a problem if he's using a 2h elemental weapon like Bahamut's Tear or Crimson's STMR (2h fire weapon). But for the regular folks who don't have access to these STMRs, they'll have to make up loss in damage by using a 2h non-elemental weapon to gain additional damage variance **and** an external imbue source eg. Sakura with thunder element. [**Possible enhancements**](/tt): Self imbue thunder/fire added to Volt/Flame Blade. --- [**Ridiculously low chain mods**](/tg) Hyoh's main chain modifier (Servant of the Blade) is at a measly 5.6x mod. Looking at Akstar, his chain mod is about 30.5x after stacking. Raegen? 40x after using his LB. CG Bartz? 62.5x mod or 125x mod with DW. And it will only go upwards from there. The only "redeeming" factor is his LB, which is at respectable 19x base mod at maxed level. True that this can be boosted with LB damage steroid materias like Squall's STMR, BT, Kyanos's TMR etc. But you'll have to spam LB consistently by having a unit with dedicated Entrust to keep him going. And with bosses getting harder with more shenanigans, maintaining an LB spam will surely be rough. [**Possible enhancements**](/tt): Boost his mods either through an exclusive story event; which seems to be a trend now with units getting new abilities or having their existing abilities upgraded by clearing trials or events. I honestly don't know how much they'll push up his damage modifiers but it is unlikely that they'll ramp it up **that much** especially since they're doing CG reskins. --- [**DR chainer**](/tg) Most of the top chainers now chain with the AT or AMoE family. All of Hyoh's skills chain with the DR family (with the exception of Ruthless Blade) which has more or less taken a back seat in the chaining scene with AT/AMoE being more prevalent. [**Possible enhancements**](/tt): I don't think they'll change his chaining frames so this will unlikely happen unless Alim goes ape shit or something so don't bother hoping. --- [**No innate ailment resistance**](/tg) One of his biggest flaws. Hyoh has **zero** innate ailment resistance. This becomes an even bigger problem in the future bosses where will be able to break your resistance to different ailments. [**Possible enhancements**](/tt): Upgrade his passives with some ailment resistance. --- Despite all these, I wish to see him rise up, even it is for a little while before the next wave of power creep comes in which may be CG Firon? CG Zidane? CG HA HA HA HA HA? What do you think his enhancements will be?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(GL) Advanced Planning: Folka's Story Event Bonus Stage</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-08 10:27:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone. I'm putting this up in case there are players like myself doing some advanced planning for Folka's Story Event Bonus Stage which should technically be this month. Here's a quick run down of the Bonus NRG stage: [Libra](https://altema.jp/ffbe/mizukagaminomikoextra) of enemies (needs a fair bit of scrolling down to get there). * Wave 1: Ochu  amp; Microchu * Wave 2: Kid Bombs x 8 * Wave 3: Europa  amp; Searchers --- ###Ochu  amp; Microchu  gt; 2+ Fire/Ice Damage, 3+ LBs, Kill w/ Magic (10% Trust Moogle) * Immune to ATK/MAG debuff * Vulnerable to DEF/SPR debuff * Inflicts Blind/Silence/Confusion Use a physical cover/provoke tank to soak its hits and you should be fine. At least build the party to be resistant to confusion so that an ally doesn't end up killing your own team mates by accident. Kill the microchus first then Ochu. --- ###Kid Bombs x 8  gt; Summon Esper, 3+ Element Chain, Clear Within 10 Turns (10% Trust Moogle) * Immune to ATK/MAG debuff * Vulnerable to DEF/SPR debuff * **Immune** to **non-elemental damage** The kid bombs are taken from the Great Explosion Festival with adjusted stats. They have -100% against one element and 300% resistance against the rest and have twice as much HP (8,888,888). I think this would be the more problematic stage of the 3 for most players because of how you'll have to fit in all 8 types of elemental damage and then get to face Europa immediately after. To makes matters worse, they also get the pre-emptive strike where an AoE imperil (30%) will be cast on your team along with some hard hitting ST magic damage. Some examples of ideal units used here would be: * Onion Knight (Fire/Wind/Water/Earth) * Kunshira (Fire/Water/Thunder/Wind/Light) * Mediena (Fire/Thunder/Wind/Light/Ice) * Livid Shantotto (All) * Tiana (Fire/Water/Wind/Thunder/Earth) * Trance Terra (Fire/Ice/Thunder/Holy/Dark) I've only listed those that came to mind with **singular** element damage instead of dual or multi-elemental damage skills like Kryla or Circe as I'm not sure if those would work. The same goes for SBDF's Summer Whip. What if you don't have the above units? Consider [**Arc Arcana**](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Arc_Arcana) which was obtained during FFX Mt Gagazet Exploration. This enables you to access Fire/Ice/Thunder/Water damage leaving you with only 4 other elements (Wind/Light/Dark/Earth) to deal with assuming you're using a magic DD that is. The other option would be [**Lumi #232;re**](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Lumi%C3%A8re) from Pride of Gungnan Story Event to access Fire/Thunder/Water/Wind **hybrid** damage. Also, remember to **make use of the elemental magic/skills that you gain from Espers**! For example, TT with Leviathan would be able to cover up to **7 elements** as Leviathan provides Wind/Water magic on top of her pre-existing 5 elements. They would also explode doing **AoE fixed damage** of their respective elements. If you're planning to camp this stage out and wait for them to explode on their own, you'll need 100% elemental resistance after removing the elemental debuff to negate the damage. --- ###Europa  amp; Searcher  gt; Fire/Lightning/Earth Damage, No Items, Kill w/ Esper (10% 5 #9733; Summon Ticket) * Europa is immune to DEF/SPR debuffs but is vulnerable to ATK/MAG breaks * Searchers are immune to ATK/MAG debuffs but are vulnerable to DEF/SPR breaks. This boss is an exact copy  amp; paste from Scorn of the Marching Beasts. I'm linking /u/Sinzar_'s [Europa Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9p98hf/guide_marching_beasts_europa_two_methods/) as it's the most helpful one I've found thus far in case anyone needs it again. Here's a 20 turn rotation of Europa: |Turn|Attack Mode| --:|:--| |1|Shooting Mode (wind)| |2|Shooting mode (holy)| |3|Shooting mode (water)| |4|Impact Mode| |5|Impact Mode| |6|Shooting Mode (ice)| |7|Shooting Mode (dark)| |8|Shooting Mode (wind)| |9|Impact Mode| |10|Impact Mode| |11|Shooting mode (holy)| |12|Shooting mode (water)| |13|Shooting Mode (ice)| |14|Impact Mode| |15|Impact Mode| |16|Shooting Mode (dark)| |17|Shooting Mode (wind)| |18|Shooting mode (holy)| |19|Impact Mode| |20|Impact Mode| While in Shooting Mode, the elements used follow the pattern of Wind  gt; Holy  gt; Water  gt; Ice  gt; Dark  gt; loop. Have Lakshmi Esper with charm/stop protection. Equip your DD with physical/magical Machine Killer for added damage. **Shooting Mode** * Kill the Searcher nearest to the team or be prepared to eat a massive laser chain. * Apply Stop protection **Impact Mode** * Apply Charm protection * Maintain physical cover/provoke and keep reraise up on your tank. --- Let me know if you spot any errors or have any suggestions/ideas to add on.</TEXT>

Ochu does mainly physical damage so a full evade provoke/physical tank will carry the team through. Just beware of Blind/Silence/Confusion from the Ochu Dance. Remember to kill it with magic to complete the mission. --- ###Kid Bombs **Type**: Demon This is the arguably the most troublesome stage because of 2 things - the mission requirements and the AI. First off, they can't be ATK/MAG debuffed. They have 300% resistance to all other element (including non-elemental) except their counter element. They also imperil you by 30% as a pre-emptive and their self-destruct is an AoE fixed magical damage attack. The kid bombs have -100% resistance of their counter elements. Eg. Fire Kid Bomb has -100% Ice resist, Thunder Kid Bomb has -100% Water resist etc. Thankfully, they can be DEF/SPR broken and are also vulnerable to Disease ailment. Also to note, according to the [Great Explosion festival wiki](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Great_Explosion_Festival): Every 2 turns, there's a chance to use "X Bomb junior is trembling", where X denotes the elemental type. Next turn: Self-Destruct. * 15% chance for Fire, Thunder, Wind, and Light Bomb Juniors. * 30% chance for Ice, Water, Stone, and Dark Bomb Juniors. My loadout: |Unit|Element Coverage| :--|:--| |[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)|[](#Z/Icons/z6/)| |[Barbariccia](#I/Icons/u1315/)|[](#Z/Icons/z1/)[](#Z/Icons/z2/)[](#Z/Icons/z4/)[](#Z/Icons/z5/)[](#Z/Icons/z8/)| |[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|[](#Z/Icons/z3/)| |[CG Fina](#I/Icons/u815/)|[](#Z/Icons/z7/)| Wilhelm was also equipped with an Earth weapon (obtained from Energy Transfer Station Exploration) to tackle the wind kid bomb using D Sword/Rod Crusher. If you've built Wilhelm with high DEF, you'll do more damage using that skill since it scales with DEF. MVP was Barbariccia equipped with Arc Arcana and quad covered Fire/Water/Ice/Wind using dual/triple cast. She also had Diabolos Esper and Malboro #8217;s Whip for added Magic Demon Killers. Hyoh was chaining with Thunder element for the mission. If you don't have Hyoh but rocking with Kurasame, he can cover 3 elements if you equip him with an elemental sword eg. thunder as he has pre-existing ice/water chaining skills I don't have Loren at all but if you do, she's a very great asset here because she covers some elements while providing a strong debuff/imperil at the same time. Fina cast her LB whenever possible for AoE reraise in case any of the bombs detonated early and was also built with as much elemental resistance as possible. She was in charge of Light element using Sacred Burst. I had Ramuh with M.Demon Killer on her to boost her damage. I was counting on some of the bombs to self-destruct when I damaged them but only one of them did. So it didn't go exactly as planned. I managed to clear it in 13 turns. Will attempt again for that 10 turn mission. [**Edit**](/tg): I managed to do it in exactly 10 turns. Had to adjust some rotations and use Barb's CD to enable triple cast first while maintaining Lid's LB break. --- ###Europa  amp; Searcher **Type**: Machine Europa  amp; Searchers are basically copied from Scorn of the Marching Beasts. This was my rotation: |Turn|Europa|[CG Fina](#I/Icons/u815/)|[CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)|[Barbariccia](#I/Icons/u1315/)|[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)|[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)| --:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |1|Shooting mode [](#Z/Icons/z5/)|Dispelga x2|LB debuff|Tempest Eye Wall (120% wind/thunder imperil) |LB|LB|Barareoga| |2|Shooting mode [](#Z/Icons/z7/)|Divine Veil|MP Regen|Sunder|SoTB|SoTB|Provoke| |3|Shooting mode [](#Z/Icons/z4/)|LB|ATK/MAG debuff|Sunder|SoTB|SoTB|LB| |4|Impact Mode|Esper|Entrust|LB|LB|LB|LB| |5|(Europa Dead, Searchers Left)|Heal + Dispel|LB debuff|Firaga|PB + SoTB|PB + SoTB|Provoke| |6|-|Entrust|Entrust|-|LB|LB|-| Barb clutches it once more. Her Tempest Eye Wall allowed me to burst Europa using Hyohs LB on the first turn. Then her buffed Sunder after using her CD was a pseudo finisher move. --- I hope you found this useful. Good luck!</TEXT>

Here they are: [Onion Knight Refia](#I/Icons/u1194/) Onion Knight Refia (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+50% ATK w/ Sword  amp; +50% LB Fill Rate) [STMR](/#label-red): **1h Sword** (+160 ATK, 30% Chance Poison/Blind/Silence/Confuse  amp; +30% ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR) **Summary**: OKR has a 80% fire/water/wind/earth imperil in her LB. Chains with the Onion Slice family. Her skill set covers fire/water/wind/earth elements and she has bonus innate killers vs Aquan and Undead race. She also gets **60% TDW** at maxed 7 #9733;. --- [Dark Knight Luneth](#I/Icons/u1197/) Dark Knight Luneth (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+25% Accuracy, +50% TDH  amp; +50% Phys Damage vs Demon) [STMR](/#label-red): **Katana** (+168 ATK, Dark Element  amp; Grant Skill: Lose 30% HP + 500% AoE 1 Hit Physical Attack) **Summary**: DKL is a mighty finisher. His LB has a 22x mod at maxed level and increases damage against Aquan/Demon race for 1 Turn. He has innate 150% TDH and has on-demand W-cast for his skill set. Much like DKC, his attacks come at a cost of his HP% although not nearly as suicidal. He also has decent 50% break in his kit. --- [Doga](#I/Icons/u1200/) Doga **TMR**: **Rod** (+8 ATK, +103 MAG  amp; +20% Fire Resist) **Summary**: Chains with the Quake family. His LB boosts resistance to fire element by 100%. --- [Unei](#I/Icons/u1203/) Unei **TMR**: **Staff** (+6 ATK, +75 MAG, +92 SPR) **Summary**: Chains with the Tornado family. LB increases resistance to ice element by 89%. --- There was no step-up for FFIII in JP. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/88j467/jp_final_fantasy_iii_pickup_thread_41_414/) --- # Banner 2  #8211; Ignacio Story Event [CG Ignacio](#I/Icons/u1249/) Ignacio (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTN8LseNrEQ /#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK w/ Axe, +50% LB Fill Rate, +25% Accuracy +50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Axe** (+170 ATK, Fire Element +50% Accuracy, Variance: 1.1x~1.9x) **Summary**: Ah at last, our beloved Flame Lord in all his blacksmith glory! He #8217;s not just a finisher (32.61x mod with T-cast), but also supports with buffs, imbue and imperil! A dream unit! With his enhancements in JP, he provides a whopping [**180%**](/tg) STAT buff. YES, they are higher values than some  #8211;cough-Nichol-cough- dedicated buffers themselves! Along with an on-demand **5 turn** 100% fire imperil. His STMR is perfect for him, though sadly locked to fire. On a whole, he is a multi-packaged unit that works marvellously on any team. --- [Suzume](#I/Icons/u1252/) Suzume **TMR**: **Clothes** (+21 ATK, +36 DEF, +20% ATK with Katana) **Summary**: Apart from her TMR, she doesn #8217;t offer much. Her TMR is superb for units such as Sephiroth/Auron/Citan and Akstar for obvious reasons. --- [PNK-2](#I/Icons/u1255/) PNK-2 **TMR**: **Accessory** (+35 ATK/MAG  amp; 1 LB/Turn) **Summary**: TMR is a great accessory with LB fill. --- [Weyham](#I/Icons/u1258/) Weyham **TMR**: **Materia** (+20% ATK  amp; 1.1x LB Damage) **Summary**: This is where the game starts trolling players who pulled hard for Squall #8217;s STMR. Lol. Weyham brings a little something extra for machine bosses  #8211; 30% physical/magical machine killer buff. --- Ignacio is on the standard 11k lapis one-time step-up banner with 5x chances of getting him on the last step. Banner info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8id3o1/jp_story_event_21_pickup_megathread_510521/) For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Ignacio Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information: [Libra](https://altema.jp/ffbe/honoonokajisyokuninextora). * 1st Wave: **Terror Knight**. He #8217;s straight outta Scorn of the Marching Beasts with his AoE Death shenanigan. He can be killed with Phoenix Down/Raise. * 2nd Wave: **Experiment No.44**. For those of you who don #8217;t remember, this boss is taken from HT Lid #8217;s Story event and injected with steroids. He #8217;s weak to fire but if you use fire, he #8217;ll counter with a 99% physical/magical damage mitigation or ST snort. He #8217;ll cast a powerful AoE magic on thresholds 80/65/50/35/20% HP. On top of that he has ST MP drain. And all of his attacks hit hard. * 3rd Wave: **Intangir** from [Scorn of the Intangir](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Scorn_of_the_Intangir). --- #Banner 3- Hess Banner (Yuraisha, Franis, Ishil) **STILL** no Yuraisha banner. Huh. I was fairly certain that they would drop her banner this month especially considering where the latest story stopped at. [Yuraisha](#I/Icons/u1185/) Yuraisha (5 #9733; - 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% SPR, +20% MP  amp; Auto-Protect/Auto-Shell) [STMR](/#label-red): **Hat** (+34 DEF, +95 SPR, +30% HP  amp; Auto-Regen) **Summary**: Yuraisha offers a ton of buffs, killer boosts, elemental resistances and can even chain with the Quake family. --- [Franis](#I/Icons/u1188/) Franis **TMR**: **Accessory** (+40 ATK, +3 DEF, +10% HP  amp; Blind Immunity) **Summary**: Nothing much except a neat TMR. --- [Ishil](#I/Icons/u1191/) Ishil **TMR**: **Hat** (+20 ATK/SPR  amp; +50% Silence Resist) **Summary**: An odd TMR but if anything else, it #8217;s PPD. --- Yuraisha is a great pickup if you don #8217;t have Nichol or Zargabaath. This banner was released in the same month as Sieghard #8217;s banner in JP but we have yet to get it. Seeing that she does not have a story event of her own, it will be tough to predict when her banner will drop. She might very well be featured together with Gabranth at this point. /s --- #Trials  amp; Espers For Chamber of Arms: Trial #12 [Al Pherg](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/842c5n/jp_12_weapons_trial_12_al_pherg/) For Chamber of the Indignant: [Scorn of Gilgamesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8oz7xm/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_gilgamesh/) For Chamber of the Fallen: Trial #18 [Dark Espers II  #8211; Shiva  amp; Golem](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8filpq/jp_trial_18_dark_espers_ii_dark_shiva_dark_golem/) For Espers: * [Alexander](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8lgbgx/jp_3_alexander_esper_battle_infostrategy/) * [Ashura](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9e6tv6/jp_1_ashura_esper_battle_infostrategy/) We were technically supposed to get Alexander's 3 #9733; last month but we didn't. We have yet to receive this month's story continuation (probably next week) so there's still hope. We probably won #8217;t be getting Ashura anytime soon but I #8217;ll just put it up here for reference. Until we get the Mixer system, all Reborn Trials starting with Gilgamesh Kai will be put on hold because Trust Coins are given as rewards for certain missions. More info about the Mixer/ Trust Coin System can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8mzdqp/jp_maint_app_update_mixer_feature_story_update/) --- # Upcoming Collabs  #8211; Secret of Mana / Xenogears And we come to the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs! We got KH collab at the end of December, which was unexpected! And just as we were recovering from the Kingdom Hearts fever, Gumi decides to drop yet **another** ~~first quarterly sales~~ bombshell banner  #8211; Star Ocean! That #8217;s right! SOA has returned thanks to Claic #8217;s generous funding no doubt #8230; This time, with the 7 #9733; forms of Rena and Fayt together with a new magic DD unit, Sophia! This got me thinking - If SOA has a Sophia, I wonder if we #8217;ll get one for FFBE, whose job will definitely be ~~WIFE~~ [**MEDIC**](/tg). Anyway, good luck Claic if you're going in for round 2! May the odds be *more* in your favor this time! Also, will /u/TomAto314, who's been hoarding for Elly spill his beans for Sophia? Find out more on this week's episode of Depression Z! On a side note, JP recently released a [Re-Print of Collabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aa8c4e/jp_time_limited_collab_banners_reprint_vp_sk23_ot/) featuring VP, SD2, SD3, Octopath Traveller and NIER. This must be the golden series that we #8217;ve all been raving about. A re-run of ALL the time limited banners! --- ###Secret of Mana Banner As of now, this collab still remains a mystery. First of all, Seiken Densetsu 3 was never released outside of Japan. This means we **might never** get to see units like [Hawkeye](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/806), [Riesz](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/804) and [Kevin](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/808). The good news is however, we will most likely see a return of Secret of Mana with 7 #9733; Randi and Flammie: [Randi](#I/Icons/u330/) Randi (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **1-handed Sword** (+101 ATK +8 DEF/MAG/SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% ATK, +30% Esper Stats  amp; +15% HP/MP w/ Swords) **Summary**: An extremely versatile physical DR chainer capable of wielding Fixed Dice with multiple elemental imbues in his kit. Randi has 100% TDH as part of his trust ability and unlocks W-ability for his skills at maxed 7 #9733;. --- [Flammie](#I/Icons/u1149/) Flammie (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+50 ATK  amp; +20% HP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% ATK  amp; +50% Phys Dmg vs Beast/Spirit/Undead) **Summary**: Timed jumper capable of imbuing himself with several elements. Flammie has a total of 150% TDH (100% TDH from 6 #9733; kit + 50% TDH from trust ability). He can also imperil for 100% wind/light. --- SoM has its own step-up banners too. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/7y57o1/jp_maintenance_som_raid_7_awakenings_more_219/). Seeing what happened with VP banner, I wouldn #8217;t get my hopes up high that the rainbow units obtained will be limited to on-banner units. --- ###Xenogears Xenogears collab is split into two parts. Part I consists of Fei, Elly and Bart. Part II has Citan and Maria. Both are released within a span of two consecutive months. These are all the units from this series: **Part I**: [Fei](#I/Icons/u1219/) Fei (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+20% ATK/DEF, %MP/Turn, +30% ATK with Clothes) [STMR](/#label-red): **Clothes** (+1200 HP, +30 ATK, +25 DEF/SPR, +50% ATK with Knuckles) **Summary**: Fei #8217;s LB comes with a 80% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth/Light/Dark imperil. He mainly chains with himself and can chain with the AT family as well on his dark elemental skill. He has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. --- [Elly](#I/Icons/u1222/) Elly (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Rod** +32 ATK, +120 MAG, +20% MAG [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** +60% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resist, +60% MAG with Rod **Summary**: Elly is a [superb wind magical chainer](https://youtu.be/NVKhSfSCopo?t=169). She has on-demand W **and** T-cast (Trust Ability). Her CD skill imperils by -100% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth and unlocks **Penta-cast**, essentially making her a monstrous magic nuker. --- [Bart](#I/Icons/u1228/) Bart (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Whip** (+135 ATK  amp; +% Phys Damage vs Machines) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% ATK, +% LB Fill Rate, +% Phys/Mag Damage vs Machines) **Summary**: Bart #8217;s LB has a 70% DEF/SPR debuff. He has a multi-elemental imbue kit which includes Fire, Water, Wind and Earth and doubles up as an AoE MP refresh. He comes with a provoke and mirage ability too! --- [Emeralda](#I/Icons/u1225/) Emeralda **TMR**: **Materia** (+40% MAG  amp; Recover 5% MP per Turn) **Summary**: Wind chainer with W-cast. --- [Rico](#I/Icons/u1231/) Rico **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% HP/ATK/DEF) **Summary**: ST Earth/Fire damage dealer. --- [Chu-Chu](#I/Icons/u1234/) Chu-Chu **(Free Unit)** **TMR**: **Materia** (+10% Wind/Earth Resist) **Summary**: ST Heal/Raise. --- That concludes Part I. The banners are rotational: * Fei/Emeraldo/Rico * Elly/Emeraldo/Rico * Bart/Emeraldo/Rico * Fei/Elly/Bart/Emeraldo/Rico There is also a Ticket Campaign. Players will receive **one** special ticket that allows you to exchange for a Fei/Elly/Bart [**of choice**](/tg) with every 5,000 Lapis spent. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8dlu47/jp_420430_banners_xenogears_collab_pickup_thread/) --- **Part II** [Citan](#I/Icons/u1261/) Citan (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK with Fist/ Katana  amp; 50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **Katana** (+176 ATK, +20% ATK  amp; +75% Phys/Mag Damage vs Humans) **Summary**: Water elemental AT chainer. Has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. Citan also rocks a solid innate 150% TDH and is an [extremely powerful chainer to date.](https://youtu.be/ummtbDr4Juo?t=317) There #8217;s a solid breakdown of his kit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8l8i4d/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_citan/) --- [Maria](#I/Icons/u1264/) Maria (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+30 DEF, +52 MAG  amp; +40% Light Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): [Materia] (+30% MAG with Rod, +30% MP/MAG  amp; 5 LB/Turn) **Summary**: The ultimate [fister](https://youtu.be/yFL5rskgjQg?t=583). Her LB makes [regular Aigaion her bitch](https://youtu.be/qsTvBOu2zF4?t=19). Not sure about Aigaion Kai though... --- [Billy](#I/Icons/u1267/) Billy **TMR**: **Gun** (+130 ATK, +20 SPR) **Summary**: LB provides +80% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resistance and comes with innate DW. He also imperils earth by 60% in his chaining skill. --- And with this, we #8217;re done with Part II of Xenogears! Part II of Xenogears has a 15k lapis step-up banner: * Step 1: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; Guaranteed Billy * Step 2: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1.5x 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Rates * Step 3: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1x Guaranteed Random 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Unit More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8kz4t0/jp_521531_banners_xenogears_collab_2_pickup_thread/) --- ###Other Collabs There are 2 other possible collabs waiting for a re-run - Just Cause  amp; Lara Croft. We were supposed to get JC collab re-run in Dec with JC4's release on Dec 4th 2018 but instead we got Katy Perried right after the Fan Festa. SOA has already made its return so it technically *shouldn #8217;t be long* before we see Just Cause and Tomb Raider re-runs. --- #TomAto #8217;s Longshot Collab! Hot off the heels of the recent [Fornite Collab]( http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000983715/article/nfl-teams-up-with-epic-games-enters-world-of-fortnite) the NFL will now be coming to the world of Lapis just in time for the Superbowl! **5-7 #9733; LA Rams** * Missed PI Call - Ability to evade one attack * Young Coach - 20% to inflict charm on any action * Goff - Decreased stats for first 16 turns **5-7 #9733; New England Patriots** * Deflate - reduces stats of all enemies * Old Coach - Boosts stats by shouting "Do Your Job!" * Brady - Hunts Christine to steal more of her immortal essence -Courtesy of /u/TomAto314 --- #Other Events ###Chinese New Year/Valentine #8217;s Day With CNY looming, we would very well see the 7 #9733; awakening for Doggo, Ang and Yun.

    <TITLE>An alternative on chasing the Meta</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-23 01:41:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I thought of this a while ago and posted in DHT but I decided to make a dedicated thread about it to get more discussion going. The majority of us are often, if not always chasing the latest unit with the highest chaining modifier to keep up with the META. And by META, I mean the common trend of **Chainers**. Hopping from Chainer A to Chainer B, from Hyoh to Akstar to CG Lightning to CG Bartz and so on. The list seems non-exhaustive. However, coming across an entirely different term of META in a different sub, which I would admit is a rather cringeworthy and abominating deviation of the original meaning as **M**ost **E**fficient **T**actic **A**vailable, it shed some light on a different perspective for chasing damage dealers. If you're someone who wants to take the game slow and steady and clear trials at your own pace, you may stop at this point. If you're someone like myself who absolutely loves large numbers and one shot-one kills, you may keep reading. Why are we continously trying to get the latest chainer when we can settle for a **finisher** instead? Assuming you can smoothly fit a finisher into your team and make it work of course. If chaining seems to work better for you based on who and what you have, then you should probably stick to it. Else, here's an alternative. Using the information we have at hand, Akstar *seems* to mark the end of the TDH era with CG Lightning and CG Bartz ushering in the age of TDW. There is also roughly a 4-5 months gap between Akstar and the start of TDW. Assuming you have decided to go balls deep for Akstar, you'll have a nice period before he gets outcrept and then, you would probably need to start planning resources to seek out the next big leap in chaining damage which is CG Bartz. Seeing the recent trend in JP, chainers of late have a pattern of using several other skills to boost/stack and ramp up their damage across several turns. Take Akstar for example. He needs to imbue and imperil, start building stacks, LB then nuke. Similarly, Bartz has to "level up" across the first few turns, permanently boosting the modifiers on his damage, imbue and imperil then CD before unleashing a massive nuke. Conversely, looking at GL and seeing how absolutely absurd a unit like Reberta can be sub 1800 ATK with the plethora of jump damage boosters and killers, you would look towards someone similar like Cid and of course, Regina. As we know, Cid, has the highest damage in a single turn. Considering how we can't stack materias in GL as opposed to JP, Cid's jump modifier after using his CD skill sits at approximately **~220x** mod (correct me if I'm wrong). You don't have to build stacks, you don't have to worry about **losing your stacks** should something awry happens to screw up your team. His damage is a fixed modifier which can easily be amplified by adding more jump boosters. All you need is to unlock his CD, jump, land and done. Isn't that more efficient? Isn't that more convenient? On the downside, on turns when his CD isn't up, he's not really doing anything except babysitting his daughters while your everyday chainers are consistenly pumping out damage every turn and slowly witting the boss away. But who cares! You would probably get the work done in another jump anyway! Why put in the extra effort to ramp up your damage across a few turns only to achieve a smaller chunk of damage as compared to using less turns in setting up, with lower chances of getting screwed over and acheiving a larger if not the most optimal outcome? If you aren't convinced with Cid, look at Regina. She can consistently pump out fixed absurd amounts of damage every turn provided you're able to maintain her steep MP requirements. You have access to a permanent V-cast which also builds up her LB and boost her sole damaging ability **all in one turn** which also doesn't require stacking and such. Not enough MP for V-cast? Her LB would get the job done. What do you need? **ANY PAIR** of chainers to cap. And I mean seriously any chainers would do. You can use Wado  amp; Yuri, or 2x Shantottos or 2x Pod chainers. No need for 7 #9733; ones. Assuming we get Summer Fina/Lid, she essentially fills the role of breaker, imbue, imperil **and grants the entire team** an AR-chaining water skill! I mean c'mon. That makes it a ton easier to fit a finisher into your team! Don't finishers seem more efficient both tactically and resourcefully as opposed to chainers? They have longer shelf lives too. So far, Cid hasn't been outcrept in terms of jump damage **yet**. This is by no means an attempt to be a nay-sayer to chainers or to affect your decision in managing your resources in any way. I'm opening up a different take to an alternative. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advanced Resource Planning  #8211; Finishers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-24 11:37:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>#Introduction This thread acts as a supplement to my [monthly outlook threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aid006/gl_monthly_outlook_february/) and as a follow up to the [alternative of chasing finishers over chainers]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aiue24/an_alternative_on_chasing_the_meta/) to further expand on finishers and how to build a team around them with the information we have on hand. **Disclaimer**: If you #8217;re fully into chainers **only** and don #8217;t really bother about finishers, continue at your own discretion. #High Net-Worth Finishers A finisher is a unit that prioritizes on one or two skills at most as their primary source of damage. They can either be a sole damage dealer or can be used in conjunction with chainers to  #8220;cap #8221; or  #8220;finish #8221; the chain by dealing a very powerful blow to an enemy by combining it with the bonus multipliers you get from chaining. Examples of known finishers include but not limited to Blossom Sage Sakura (magical), Dragon Lord (magical), Fire Veritas (physical), Reberta (physical) and Light Veritas (hybrid). |Upcoming Finishers|Name|ETA| :--|:--|:--| |[CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/)|Cid|March| |[Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/)|Regina|June| **Two**. We have two high net-worth upcoming finishers  #8211; Cid and Regina. --- #[CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) Cid [Unit Link]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1282#label-red) Cid is a dragoon and uses mainly spears and jump attacks for damage. His main source of damage comes from **Revised Spineshatter Dive Type 0**, a timed jump. You #8217;ll **only** use this after using his CD skill, Wind of Heavenly Dragon, unless you don #8217;t mind waiting out 15 turns for him to land. In GL, unlike JP, we are unable to stack materias freely. With that in mind, these are the possible jump boosters for Cid (no STMRs) |Jump Boosters|Bonus| :--|--:| |Innate Passive|1.5| |Trust Ability|0.5| |Stoss Spear|1| |Dragoon's Gauntlet|1| |Farma's Accessory|0.5| |SSP - Wind|0.25| |Hero's Vow - Wind|0.75| |**Total Boost**|**5.5**| With enhancements, his Innate Passive gets an extra 50% boost, putting his jump booster total at 6x. The known cap in JP for jump damage is 800%, or 8x. |Skill|Base Modifier|Post Enhancements| :--|--:|--:| |Revised Spineshatter Dive Type 0|18.5|**40**| |Known Jump Cap|8x|8x| |**Potential** Modifiers|148|320| |GL Jump Booster|5.5x|**6x**| |**Actual** Modifiers|101.75|**240**| If you think GL #8217;s Reberta hits hard with Red Vengeance wait till Cid shows you how a Dragoon **truly** lands with style. These jaw dropping modifiers that you #8217;re seeing aren #8217;t even taking advantage of the extra ones you gain from debuffing, imperils and killers. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ae98u7/primer_on_offensive_stats_or_why_that_unassuming/) by /u/SuperMuffinmix shows you the magic behind multipliers. On a side note, according to the wiki:  gt; If multiple units are landing, they land in quick succession. If the target is dead, a new target is chosen if available, or else no damage is dealt. This means that with 2 Cids, you #8217;ll make short work of double boss trials like [Dark Siren/Ifrit Kai](https://youtu.be/5L1fdWjnhrE?t=191) He #8217;s also really easy to gear. His BiS non-STMR weapon is Stoss Spear and if you #8217;re building him purely with jump boosters, the equipment required are readily available. You #8217;ll also most likely end up with 2 free materia slots for killers to further boost his damage. While his modifiers are definitely godlike, he does have his setbacks. He relies on his CD to do his deed so on turns when his CD isn #8217;t up, he won #8217;t really be doing anything. He also faces restriction in trials like [Shinryu]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a60u2z/jp_trial_shinryu_ #12375; #12435; #12426; #12421; #12358;/) due to anti-jump mechanics. He #8217;ll also need an external imbue and imperil for more efficiency (more on this later). But other than that, he wrecks basically everything (except Blood Moon Kai of course). --- #[Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/) Regina [Unit Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1395#label-red) Regina is mainly a gun-wielder and is even more popular than Cid because of how unrestricted her capability is. You don #8217;t need set up turns and her skills are readily available for nukes. Her skillset is unique because she has an on-demand V-cast and only **one** main source of damage from **Regina Cannon**, which is boosted by literally the rest of her entire kit. Skill | Effect | ---|---| Regina Cannon | 100% ST 1 Hit Physical Attack + Ignore 50% DEF  amp; 2 Turns 2.2x LB Damage | Her standard rotation: CD 1  gt; CD 2  gt; Restart Command  gt; VS  gt; Regina Cannon |Base Mod|CD 1|CD 2|Restart Command|VS (Demon/Spirit/Machine)|Regina Cannon Final Mod| --:|:--|:--|:--|:--|--:| |200|(10 x 200)|(10 x 200)|(8 x 200)|(5 x 200)|6800%| 68x outright burst and on the next turn, her LB gets boosted by 2.2x due to the in-built effect of Regina Cannon. Her base LB damage at maxed level is 32x. After her first turn, her LB #8217;s damage will be at 70.4x! It chains and is [seriously backloaded](https://youtu.be/TJv1JhhRJVs?t=195) The only real downside is her **huge MP cost** (~310 MP) in maintaining her damage output. She would require some external imbue/imperil help if you #8217;re using a 2h non-elemental weapon. In GL, we have Linebacker G-87 MSGL, a 2h fire elemental weapon as a viable alternative; so if you #8217;re using this, you #8217;ll only need an imperil which is achievable seeing how fire is a pretty common element. #Working With Finishers As you can see from Cid and Regina, their biggest downside is the need for external assist, which is why a lot of players don #8217;t really enjoy finishers because **it is hard** to fit them into their team while fulfilling other key roles like healers, debuff and buff. Or is it? Enter [**multi-role filling units**](/gt). A multi-role unit is one that does several things, freeing up crucial unit space to slot in another healer or another tank depending on the trial. |Unit|Name|Roles| :--|:--|:--| |[CG Ignacio](#I/Icons/u1249/)|Ignacio|Buff, Imbue, Imperil, Finisher| |[Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/)|Summer Fina/Lid (Fid)|Debuff, Imbue, Imperil, Support| --- |[CG Ignacio](#I/Icons/u1249/) Ignacio [Unit Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1249#label-red) We will be getting Ignacio **next month**. His unique kit is what makes him shine. Not only can he act as a finisher, he doubles up really nicely as an imbue, imperil and buffer. This utility side to his kit gets enhanced in the future, making him **even better**. He has on-demand W-cast which can be used to imbue a unit while imperiling an enemy at the same time! With his trust ability, he gets T-cast which potentially allows him to imbue 2 units at once while providing the required imperil. The downside? It #8217;s all locked to fire element. --- [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) Summer Fina/Lid (Fid) [Unit Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1361#label-red) Now I don #8217;t want to really hype up this unit as much because I #8217;m not entirely sure her kit will be exactly similar to the one in JP but assuming it is, Fid is sort of the opposite of Ignacio. She has access to **on-demand** double 60% breaks through permanent W-cast which can be boosted to 74% value if you use her CD prior to those. Fid also provides **AoE water imbue** and can imperil water/ice by 100% (post CD). And the best part? She can give the entire party an AR chaining water skill for 4 turns. So there isn #8217;t the need to equip Pods if you have her. The drawback? She #8217;s locked to water/ice elements. #Potential Team Set Ups Most of the trials will require at least 1 tank and 1 healer. That frees up 4 unit spaces. Assuming you #8217;re only bringing 1 finisher for damage, that leaves 3 other slots which can be used to fit in a debuffer and a support. With 1 slot remaining, you can bring a friend finisher or another support or an imperil depending on the battle. Currently, to make finishers effectively work, you need 2 chainers which by far the best method is through Pod chaining. The closer alternative is Flood chaining using Leviathan #8217;s skill and another Flood chainer like Nichol 7 #9733;. As we progress into the future and get said multi-role units like Ignacio or Fid, you get more flexible unit spaces to fit in finishers. Instead of using 3 slots, one for debuff, imbue and imperil, you only need 1 if you have Fid. That leaves **FIVE** open spaces. Slot in 2 finishers and the remaining 3 can easily fit 2 tanks + 1 healer or 2 healers + 1 tank or 1 tank + 1 healer + 1 buffer. #Resource Planning So if all these has piqued your interest in going for a finisher, the next upcoming SE banner will probably be one of the best investments especially if you plan to get Cid. You get a unit that fills the imbue, imperil and buffing department until Fid arrives. Conversely, if you **don't** plan to get Cid and plan to get Regina instead, you should make room for Fid because according to the JP timeline, she comes in before Regina's banner. The only [**real underlying risk**](/tg) here is Fid's banner. In JP, you can get 1x Summer Fina/Lid at a cost of 8,000 Lapis [via a bundle](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9650dc/jp_story_event_24_banners_megathread_810820/). The odds of that happening in GL may be slim, if not, non-existent at all seeing the type of bundles we're getting.. A larger amounts of resources may be required and as such, between Ignacio and Fid, I would say Ignacio is a safer bid with a lower risk involved. If you're a high risk high reward person then this wouldn't really affect you. At the end of the day, if you don't plan to allocate any lapis for these units, all of them are obtainable via UoC. #Closing Remarks The takeaway? Don #8217;t let the current *system* of chainer A x chainer B constrain you. Finishers are slowly but surely gaining back their popularity and is a good alternative to using chainers. Feel free if you have more to deliberate! Thank you for reading!</TEXT>

Either it drops next month or it doesn't drop at all. * XG is predicted to be a complete mash of all XG featured units to avoid certain units from being powercrept eg. Citan by Akstar. It might possibly drop just prior to Akstar's banner. * Yuraisha or Karlotte might be featured as a side-unit in Akstar's banner seeing how she's in perpetual limbo and how we got Awakened Rain in Hyoh's banner. Alternatively, Karlotte and Yuraisha might be in one banner. * JC banner is also pushed back. The banner should have returned in December last year along with the new JC game release but didn't. * FF Series is based off JP's timeline. Expect random swaps/delays for certain banners. * No adjustments made to FFBE Story-Event units because that is the most concrete timeline by far. --- #Banner 1  #8211; FFIII I was surprised that they brought forward FFX and swapped it with FFIII. What #8217;s next? Bringing forward the rest of the FFVII crew in advance? /s Anyway, here are the cast of FFIII: [Onion Knight Refia](#I/Icons/u1194/) Onion Knight Refia (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+50% ATK w/ Sword  amp; +50% LB Fill Rate) [STMR](/#label-red): **1h Sword** (+160 ATK, 30% Chance Poison/Blind/Silence/Confuse  amp; +30% ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR) **Summary**: OKR has a 80% fire/water/wind/earth imperil in her LB. Chains with the Onion Slice family. Her skill set covers fire/water/wind/earth elements and she has bonus innate killers vs Aquan and Undead race. She also gets **60% TDW** at maxed 7 #9733;. --- [Dark Knight Luneth](#I/Icons/u1197/) Dark Knight Luneth (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+25% Accuracy, +50% TDH  amp; +50% Phys Damage vs Demon) [STMR](/#label-red): **Katana** (+168 ATK, Dark Element  amp; Grant Skill: Lose 30% HP + 500% AoE 1 Hit Physical Attack) **Summary**: DKL is a mighty finisher. His LB has a 22x mod at maxed level and increases damage against Aquan/Demon race for 1 Turn. He has innate 150% TDH and has on-demand W-cast for his skill set. Much like DKC, his attacks come at a cost of his HP% although not nearly as suicidal. He also has decent 50% break in his kit. --- [Doga](#I/Icons/u1200/) Doga **TMR**: **Rod** (+8 ATK, +103 MAG  amp; +20% Fire Resist) **Summary**: Chains with the Quake family. His LB boosts resistance to fire element by 100%. --- [Unei](#I/Icons/u1203/) Unei **TMR**: **Staff** (+6 ATK, +75 MAG, +92 SPR) **Summary**: Chains with the Tornado family. LB increases resistance to ice element by 89%. --- There was no step-up for FFIII in JP. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/88j467/jp_final_fantasy_iii_pickup_thread_41_414/) --- #Banner 2  #8211; Cid Story Event [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) Cid (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OF6eGesRdw/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+25% Accuracy, +50% TDH, +75% Jump Damage  amp; +50% LB Fill Rate) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Spear** (+175 ATK, Wind Element +50% Accuracy, Variance: 1.1x~1.5x) **Summary**: Daddy who jumped away from his parental responsibilities 700 years ago is finally about to land! Only to find out the apple doesn #8217;t fall too far away from the tree. Cid is an incredible finisher with a possible 101.75x mod on his timed jump and eventually a 240x mod post-enhancements. Unlike JP, we can #8217;t stack materias in GL. So these are the possible jump boosters: |Jump Boosters|Bonus| :--|--:| |Innate Passive|1.5| |Trust Ability|0.5| |Stoss Spear|1| |Dragoon's Gauntlet|1| |Farma's Accessory|0.5| |SSP - Wind|0.25| |Hero's Vow - Wind|0.75| |Dragoon's Wisdom | 0.5 | |**Total Boost**|**6.0**| Not too hard now is it? Also, did you know that the VA of Cid also voices S #333;suke Aizen? [Keikaku Intensifies...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/011/282/206.gif) --- [Melette](#I/Icons/u1285/) Melette **TMR**: **Materia** (+30% MAG  amp; 10% MP Cost Reduction) **Summary**: Melette has a LB DEF/SPR debuff of 74% value and can provide 60% resistance across all elements. --- [Nagulfa](#I/Icons/u1288/) Nagulfa **TMR**: **Helmet** (+34 ATK, +37 DEF  amp; +100% Confuse Resist) **Summary**: Really nice ATK helmet for a 4 #9733; unit. It comes with a critical ailment resist too. --- [Farma](#I/Icons/u1291/) Farma **TMR**: **Accessory** (+30 ATK  amp; +50% Jump Damage) **Summary**: More jump damage for Cid? Sure! --- Cid is on the standard 11k lapis one-time step-up banner with 5x chances of getting him on the last step. Banner info [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8q7tr1/jp_story_event_22_pickup_megathread_611620/) For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Cid Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information: [Libra](https://altema.jp/ffbe/tenkyukakeruyumeextra). Excerpt from [JP #8217;s Cid story event megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8q7tqo/jp_story_event_22_event_megathread_611620/): * 1st Wave: **Malacoda**. One-shot or deal either light or fire damage every turn to reduce the amount healed by the boss. * 2nd Wave: **Ettin**. A dodge tank trivializes the fight. You **cannot** use dispelga/dispel because not only is it a mission requirement, doing so will cause the boss to snort you. Use other abilities such as Bushido Freedom instead. * 3rd Wave: **Gigarat** from Sieghart #8217;s Story Event. Kill the main rat first before the minions. --- #Banner 3  #8211; FFBE Orders Now this might or might not drop as a Raid banner next month but I #8217;ll just put it here just in case it does. [Nagi](#I/Icons/u1297/) Nagi (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+35 ATK/MAG, +10 DEF, +12 SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+20% ATK, +50% MAG, 60% TDW) **Summary**: Nagi chains with the AR, DR and Graviton Cannon (GC) families. She comes with innate DW and her attacks are all hybrid based. While her STMR provides an incredible TDW boost, it isn #8217;t worth chasing because down the road, CG Lightning will oust her completely with her 100% TDW TMR. --- [Yego](#I/Icons/u1300/) Yego (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+20% MP, +40% ATK w/ Whip, +25% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Whip** (+176 ATK +50% Acc, Damage Variance: 1.05x~1.55x) **Summary**: Yego is probably the one and only hardcore whip user. She comes with on-demand W-ability and chains with the Pile Driver family. Remember [Shinju](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Shinju)? Her TMR will benefit Yego greatly. Other than that, she is hardly if not ever used in JP #8230; --- [Zolulu  amp; Delulu](#I/Icons/u1303/) Zolulu  amp; Delulu **TMR**: **Materia** (+20% ATK, +40% SPR w/ Instrument, +30% ATK w/ Bow) **Summary**: A bard unit with a 70% SPR debuff LB. --- [Galas](#I/Icons/u1306/) Galas **TMR**: **2h Greatsword** (+130 ATK, +10% DEF, +50% Acc, Damage Variance: 1x~1.6x) **Summary**: TMR is literally Revolving Saw v2 with an extra 10% DEF. --- Raid banner is on a 15,000 Lapis lap (max: 1) with a guaranteed Nagi or Yego on the last step. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8sgjvw/jp_620630_banners_ffbe_orders_pickup_thread/) --- #Trials  amp; Espers For Chamber of Arms: Trial #12 [Al Pherg](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/842c5n/jp_12_weapons_trial_12_al_pherg/) For Chamber of the Indignant: [Scorn of Gilgamesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8oz7xm/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_gilgamesh/) For Chamber of the Fallen: Trial #18 [Dark Espers II  #8211; Shiva  amp; Golem](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8filpq/jp_trial_18_dark_espers_ii_dark_shiva_dark_golem/) For Espers: [Ashura](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9e6tv6/jp_1_ashura_esper_battle_infostrategy/) --- #Upcoming Collabs  #8211; Secret of Mana / Xenogears And we come to the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs! A place where we have to **work hard** for time-limited rainbows! At this point, I #8217;ve almost given up on SoM returning so if you wanna read up on the units, refer to my previous [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aid006/gl_monthly_outlook_february/). The final Fan Festa unit  #8211; Myra has also been announced for tomorrow along with Aurora Fryevia. I was initially under the impression that A.Fryevia would be in April. I was wrong. Good luck to everyone pulling for her! The next big hype is definitely Xenogears with Fei, Elly, Bart, Maria and Citan as the favorites of many players here. Hopefully the banners don #8217;t disappoint. [XG units also just got their enhancements](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/as7w6s/jp_xenogears_enhancements/) in JP. On a side note, JP released a [Re-Print of Collabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aa8c4e/jp_time_limited_collab_banners_reprint_vp_sk23_ot/) featuring VP, SD2, SD3, Octopath Traveller and NIER not too long ago. If you #8217;re lingering with one copy of any unit, this is your other chance at awakening them to 7 #9733;; apart from waiting for the prisms to appear in the trust coin shop that is. **Assuming we even get such a generous plethora of banners that is**. --- ###Xenogears Xenogears collab is split into two parts. Part I consists of Fei, Elly and Bart. Part II has Citan and Maria. Both are released within a span of two consecutive months. These are all the units from this series: **Part I**: [Fei](#I/Icons/u1219/) Fei (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+20% ATK/DEF, %MP/Turn, +30% ATK with Clothes) [STMR](/#label-red): **Clothes** (+1200 HP, +30 ATK, +25 DEF/SPR, +50% ATK with Knuckles) **Summary**: Fei #8217;s LB comes with a 80% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth/Light/Dark imperil. He mainly chains with himself and can chain with the AT family as well on his dark elemental skill. He has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. --- [Elly](#I/Icons/u1222/) Elly (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Rod** +32 ATK, +120 MAG, +20% MAG [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** +60% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resist, +60% MAG with Rod **Summary**: Elly is a [superb wind magical chainer](https://youtu.be/NVKhSfSCopo?t=169). She has on-demand W **and** T-cast (Trust Ability). Her CD skill imperils by -100% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth and unlocks **Penta-cast**, essentially making her a monstrous magic nuker. --- [Bart](#I/Icons/u1228/) Bart (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Whip** (+135 ATK  amp; +% Phys Damage vs Machines) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% ATK, +% LB Fill Rate, +% Phys/Mag Damage vs Machines) **Summary**: Bart #8217;s LB has a 70% DEF/SPR debuff. He has a multi-elemental imbue kit which includes Fire, Water, Wind and Earth and doubles up as an AoE MP refresh. He comes with a provoke and mirage ability too! --- [Emeralda](#I/Icons/u1225/) Emeralda **TMR**: **Materia** (+40% MAG  amp; Recover 5% MP per Turn) **Summary**: Wind chainer with W-cast. --- [Rico](#I/Icons/u1231/) Rico **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% HP/ATK/DEF) **Summary**: ST Earth/Fire damage dealer. --- [Chu-Chu](#I/Icons/u1234/) Chu-Chu **(Free Unit)** **TMR**: **Materia** (+10% Wind/Earth Resist) **Summary**: ST Heal/Raise. --- That concludes Part I. The banners are rotational: * Fei/Emeraldo/Rico * Elly/Emeraldo/Rico * Bart/Emeraldo/Rico * Fei/Elly/Bart/Emeraldo/Rico There is also a Ticket Campaign. Players will receive **one** special ticket that allows you to exchange for a Fei/Elly/Bart [**of choice**](/tg) with every 5,000 Lapis spent. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8dlu47/jp_420430_banners_xenogears_collab_pickup_thread/) --- **Part II** [Citan](#I/Icons/u1261/) Citan (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK with Fist/ Katana  amp; 50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **Katana** (+176 ATK, +20% ATK  amp; +75% Phys/Mag Damage vs Humans) **Summary**: Water elemental AT chainer. Has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. Citan also rocks a solid innate 150% TDH and is an [extremely powerful chainer to date.](https://youtu.be/ummtbDr4Juo?t=317) There #8217;s a solid breakdown of his kit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8l8i4d/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_citan/) --- [Maria](#I/Icons/u1264/) Maria (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+30 DEF, +52 MAG  amp; +40% Light Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): [Materia] (+30% MAG with Rod, +30% MP/MAG  amp; 5 LB/Turn) **Summary**: The ultimate [fister](https://youtu.be/yFL5rskgjQg?t=583). Her LB makes [regular Aigaion her bitch](https://youtu.be/qsTvBOu2zF4?t=19). Not sure about Aigaion Kai though... --- [Billy](#I/Icons/u1267/) Billy **TMR**: **Gun** (+130 ATK, +20 SPR) **Summary**: LB provides +80% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resistance and comes with innate DW. He also imperils earth by 60% in his chaining skill. --- And with this, we #8217;re done with Part II of Xenogears! Part II of Xenogears has a 15k lapis step-up banner: * Step 1: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; Guaranteed Billy * Step 2: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1.5x 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Rates * Step 3: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1x Guaranteed Random 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Unit More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8kz4t0/jp_521531_banners_xenogears_collab_2_pickup_thread/) --- ###Other Collabs There are 2 other possible collabs waiting for a re-run - Just Cause  amp; Lara Croft. We were supposed to get JC collab re-run in Dec with JC4's release on Dec 4th 2018 but instead we got KP-ed right after the Fan Festa. SOA has already made its return so it should be soon^TM before we see Just Cause and Tomb Raider re-runs. Looking back at the [Fan Festa 2018 wiki](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Fan_Festa_2018#Vision_for_2019), Parasite Eve seems to be hinted with extensive mentions of being a possibility for 2019 so keep your eyes peeled. --- #TomAto #8217;s Longshot Collab!

    <TITLE>King Mog Revamp</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-27 09:44:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>For those of you who don't keep in touch with the latest news from JP, the upcoming update features a [revamp of the King Mog Event](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/avai4i/jp_ff1_mk_item_world_download_campaign_more_31/). What this means: * You get a [**FREE**](/tg) 5 #9733; event unit. Eg. You get a 5 #9733; Garland for the FFI event for free! Yes, [Free. Free free free.](https://youtu.be/5VV80ozpuMw). * The event unit can be awakened to 7 #9733; via rewards from KM shop- you get the event unit prism/TMR/STMR. * BGN/INT/ADV stages removed with new difficulty added and there'll be adjustments in difficulty of the stages. --- First off, you no longer have to tap into your precious hoard of tickets/lapis to get the event units to farm the rewards if you fail to get them through regular pulls; I'm sure some of us know the feeling of not ending up with a single event unit, not even a 3 #9733; one! With this update, you literally get to awaken a free 5 #9733; unit to 7 #9733; and can obtain their TMR/STMR. Now the problem is to how much it would take to farm the prism/TMR/STMR. As of now, we do not yet know the cost. (I'll update this thread once the patch is live). But one thing's for sure- when this update hits GL 8-9 months from now (**assuming GL even implements this**) I'm almost 100% positive that we'll get the expensive end of the stick. ~~seeing how our KM shop is **still** limited to the 150,000 currency for 1/10 UoC exchange and doesn't include the cheaper ones~~ At least JP's **really working hard**. What do you think? Edit: I forgot we got the cheaper one in the story events. Lol my bad. Edit 2: This is the exchange cost using FFI KM event as reference. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/avmwoz/jp_maint_info_227/) Cost |Amount |Reward ---|---|---| 100,000 |1 |(New) 5 #9733; LV Max Garland 7,500 |5 |Garland TM 5% 32,500 |1 |Garland TM 25% 75,000 |1 |Garland TM 50% 150,000 |1 |Garland Prism 300,00 |5 |Garland STMR 5% 150,000 |1 |Garland STMR 25% 300,000 |1 |Garland STMR 50% NRG Cost of stages: 10/13/40/5 Note: Last stage (One time clear/Week 2) gives you 100k Currency in missions. Reward | Mission ---|---| 40,000 | Clear 20,000 |  lt; 15 Items 20,000 | Within 50 Turns 20,000 | No Continues</TEXT>

It's also highly unlikely that they'll push his SE to 03/29 because that usually happens on week 2 of the month. If the above is true, then there's a chance that 03/29 is another KM event, which could be FFT. We are also due for a **real** collab like XG. Or a possible re-run of JC or Tomb Raider event.

    <DATE>2019-03-06 07:33:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**Disclaimer**](/tg): This is by no means a detailed run-down step-by-step guide but as the title suggests, it is more of general strategizing revolved around Cid. [**Key Assumption**](/tg): Gumi releases this trial **after Cid's banner**. [**WIP**](/tg) for AI mechanics: [Wiki Link](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Scorn_of_Gilgamesh). Credits to /u/CottonC_3939 for providing the link. Being one of the most hyped trial battles since our last one was quite some time ago, if you're someone who wishes to experience the full battle against Gilgamesh Kai with his entire arsenal of mechanics either by going in blind or by choice, you may stop reading here. This is mainly for players who want a quick and short fight through OHKO strats (-cough-using Cid-cough-) for the clear reward **Muramasa** and/or the 1/10 UoC ticket. Mission | Rewards ---|---| Clear | [**Katana**] Muramasa (FFBE) (+172 ATK, +75% Bird Killer  amp; +50% Human Killer) Use three or less items | 10% Trust Moogle 2+ Ice/Thunder/Dark Damage | 50x Trust Coins Use 8x Limit Bursts | 1x 5 #9733; Select Summon Ticket (1/10) Excerpt from [Original JP thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8oz7xm/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_gilgamesh/) by /u/Nazta here: #Overall Tips HP Range| Effect ---|---| 100%~80% | Gilgamesh uses what isn't sealed (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light). 79%~60% | Gilgamesh counters with stronger versions of P1 attacks if hit with those elements. 59%~40% | Gilgamesh uses what isn't sealed (all elements). 39%~20% | Gilgamesh counters with stronger versions of all elemental attacks if hit with that element. 19%~0% | Gilgamesh uses what isn't sealed (all elements). * Can only be hit by Elemental Attacks. * Seal some of his attacks by hitting him with the proper elements. * Avoid some elements when his pattern changes. * Elemental damage done from counters also counts eg. Holy from Ring of the Lucii * Make sure you have high defensive stats/breaks. * Make sure you're able to deal with either Physical or Magical counters. * Dispel his ATK/MAG Break Resistance. * Put him into BREAK state by using three elemental damaging items. He will skip a turn after being hit three times, max 1/turn. * Have reraise or death resistance to deal with thresholds. Death resistance will also negate the threshold's dispel. * The threshold's skills number of targets for instant-death increases. (80% = 1 | 60% = 2 | 40%/20% = 3) * Ends turn after Threshold without going through seal/trigger mechanics. --- ###Item Strategy BREAK him and burst him down in two turns. 1. Deal 9 Elemental Damage or more during turn 1 and 2. 2. On turn 3: use an elemental damaging item. 3. On turn 4: use an elemental damaging item and set yourself up. 4. Make sure you don't go below 80% HP just yet. 5. On turn 5: use an elemental damaging item and burst him down. 6. On turn 6: burst him down again. 7. Profit. **Recommended for Item Strategy**: * 50%+ Light Resist on the unit using the item. * Phys cover Tank. (Dodge when doing Phys damage) * High Burst Chainer as main damager. --- ###Pre-emptive Attack * Casts  #12496; #12522; #12450; Self +50% Phys Mitigation (3 Turns) Self +35% ATK/MAG (3 Turns) * Casts  #12454; #12457; #12540; #12523; Self +50% Mag Mitigation (3 Turns) Self +35% DEF/SPR (3 Turns) * HP Thresholds: 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% Casts  #22885; #32681; #12539; #22825; #19979; #24481; #20813;: Negated by Death Resist, AoE 500% Hybrid Damage, AoE Instant KO (100%), 1 Target at 80%, 2 at 60%, 3 at 40/20%, AoE Dispel (ALL) #Notable Weapons First off, weapon selection. It'll be ideal if you have SBDF's STMR. If you don't, that's fine. * Lion Saber (Wind/Earth) * Necro Dagger (Fire/Dark) * Summer Whip (Skill: Rainbow Whip - All elements) Notice that on the first HP range (100%-80%), you'll only have to seal/deal with 5 elements: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light. This range is also where you'll stay to complete the rest of the missions if you choose to, since it's the tamest and most manageable part of the entire boss fight. If you have any unit that has a elemental based attack, you can cover up to 4 elements with a single attack by equipping them with the relevant weapons. Plus, depending on the unit, you get access to 100% imperil or other forms of useful utilities. Some examples off the top of my head: Unit | Offensive Utility | Weapon | Skill | Elemental Coverage ---|---|---|---|---| [CG Reagan](#I/Icons/u941/)| 100% Fire/Ice imperil | Lion Saber + Brotherhood | Burning Blood | Fire, Water, Wind, Earth | [Tidus](#I/Icons/u467/)| 100% Water imperil | Lion Saber + Excalibur | Jecht Shot | Water, Wind, Earth, Holy | [Knight Delita](#I/Icons/u563/) | 74% ATK/MAG/DEF debuff, 100% Thunder imperil | Lion Saber + Brotherhood | Raging Inferno | Fire, Water, Wind, Earth | [Kurasame](#I/Icons/u1162/) | 100% Ice Imperil | Lion Saber + Necro Dagger | Zekken- Freezing Showers/Cloudless Rain | Fire, Water, Ice, Wind, Earth, Dark | #Possible Team Comps Once you've sorted out the elemental coverage, this is the next part we'll look at. Remember what I mentioned about [Finishers getting more prevalent](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ajbkug/advanced_resource_planning_finishers/) for trials? This is a start. Gilgamesh uses  #28304; #27663; #12398; #20828; once every 3 turns, which is a **Self-Dispel**, removing his physical/magical damage mitigation. So the key here is to kill him **on turn 4** after he uses it. Looking at some JP speed clears: * [Akai's 3 Turn Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7EKk7CGE1U) Unit | Role ---|---| [CG Ignacio](#I/Icons/u1249/) | Dispel, Fire Imbue, Provoke [Auron](#I/Icons/u1240/) | Breaker, Pod Chainer [Yuraisha](#I/Icons/u1185/) | Buffer, Pod Chainer [Elly](#I/Icons/u1222/) | 100% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Imperil, equipped with Rainbow Whip to seal elements [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/)[CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) | Finisher * [Kugel's 4 Turn Kill](https://youtu.be/fFdFAMXyt1U) Unit | Role ---|---| [Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/) | Provoke/Cover Tank, Pod Chainer [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/) | 100% Fire/Ice/Thunder Imperil, Ice Imbue [CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/) | Breaker, Pod Chainer [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) | Dispel, Finisher * [ #12450; #12510; #36899;'s 4 Turn Kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r33acyRVz5A) Unit | Role ---|---| [Warrior of Light](#I/Icons/u222/) | Provoke/Cover Tank [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/) | Buffer, Water Imbue, Pod Chainer [Beowulf](#I/Icons/u1273/) | Breaker [Summer M. Fina](#I/Icons/u496/) | 110% Water Imperil, Pod Chainer [Fire Veritas](#I/Icons/u575/) | Human Killer buff [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) | Finisher * [ #12511; #12495; #12516;'s 4 Turn Kill](https://youtu.be/zn46xHbvoW8?t=419) Unit | Role ---|---| [CG Sieghart](#I/Icons/u1171/) | Provoke/Cover [Auron](#I/Icons/u1240/) | Breaker [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/) | Buffer, Water Imbue, Flood Chainer [Summer M. Fina](#I/Icons/u496/) | 110% Water Imperil, Flood Chainer, equipped with Rainbow whip to seal elements [Fire Veritas](#I/Icons/u575/) | Human Killer buff [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) | Dispel, Finisher --- The main takeaway here is that you [**must bring your own source of imbue and 100% imperil**](/tg). If you lack either of those, Cid won't deal enough damage to OTKO Gilgamesh by himself. (Thanks CottonC_3939!) Some examples of Imbue: Unit | Element Imbue ---|---| [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[Emperor Shiera](#I/Icons/u845/)[CG Ignacio](#I/Icons/u1249/) | Fire [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[Christine](#I/Icons/u8106/) | Ice [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[CG Sakura](#I/Icons/u793/) | Thunder [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/) | Water For a complete list of imperils, check [this](https://i.imgur.com/mLbBAcj.jpg) out. [Source](https://imgur.com/a/VVl4s). #Closing Words Keep in mind that we may not be able to stack Cid's TMR similar to JP so there may be some gear adjustments. Also, if they release this trial before Cid, you're on your own. I'm kidding. We've got /u/Sinzar_ to save the day! *Totally no pressure here man lmao* Feel free to add strats on your own! I'll add them whenever possible.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Resource Planning: The Importance of World Mission Reset</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-08 00:01:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi and welcome to another planning post! This time, we look at the importance of **World Mission Reset** (WMR)  gt; What exactly is WMR? WMR is basically an event where [**ALL**](/tg) the missions in the world get reset when you press the big red button. This means that all the [**LAPIS**](/gt) from missions is made available once more!  gt; How much Lapis are we looking at? ~~**85,000 Lapis**~~ Slightly under **62,000 Lapis** based on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a31i6c/gl_how_many_lapis_and_other_things_do_you_get/). Edit: A lot of people are saying 62k lapis is like 2 laps-ish for a step up banner. Yes. But the main point of WMR is having that amount of lapis as a cushion or backup in case banners you've planned for didn't go according to plan. **Note**: The 100 Lapis from clearing a stage isn't reset. Yes. That's a monstrous amount of lapis indeed! Not sure about you but I drained mine entirely for Hyoh/Awakened Rain banner lol. Totally worth it. Anyway, using [this timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/atbzpn/gl_monthly_outlook_march/) as a rough gauge and looking at how JP got their WMR last year in June, we are looking at an absolutely critical point in the timeline; assuming GL follows JP's FF series and stops their reshuffling shenanigans. So far, they've swapped FF -Type 0 and FFX. Will there be a 3rd swap for the charm? We never know. But for now, WMR is important for ALL players, more so for F2P because it will help immensely in allowing us to plan for what we want.  gt; Which key units are we looking at in the timeline? First off, Regina. She's a very powerful finisher that is still currently going strong in JP and hasn't been outcrept just yet. She doesn't need turns to set up and do not require damage stacking. Capping chains relentlessly is her forte if you can maintain her MP consumption and lastly, she absolutely wrecks everything with her LB. Next, Charlotte. Note that I'm specifically going down the timeline for SE units as that's the most solid and predictable series of events that will highly unlikely see a change. She will outcreep A.Rain and probably every other unit in terms of magical tanking with her mitigation and defensive buffs. For mages, we have Sol and then CG Dark Fina. I mean who doesn't want to be stepped on after seeing [her LB](https://youtu.be/xZ2AQsZYG_g)? Sophia who? Lol. In between them, we have Exdeath and Kefka as well. Then we have the (Fan Service) Summer Units - Fina/Lid (Fid) and Citra/Folka (Cilka, Fight me on the names. I dare you! Nah I'm kidding lol.) They will also probably be inserted somewhere in June/July. I am almost 99.99% positive that we won't be able to obtain them like how JP did - via a special bundle. So we are looking at a *possible* 20-25k step up for them. Yay more lapis required! Fid is a superb breaker/healer/imbue/imperil and can be built extremely tanky so they aren't as squishy. Cilka is an incredible evoke damage dealer and works wonders against Moon Kai. If you want more info, go look them up on the reddit wiki you lazy bastards. Next up, we are looking at the new meta- **TDW** which is ushered in by CG Lightning with her 100% TDW TMR followed by CG Bartz with his 50% TDW accessory TMR. These units will outcreep the upcoming Akstar. If you want Akstar and the TDW monsters, you've got more saving to do. Assuming GL follows JP's schedule, we also have the rest of the FFVII crew - Aerith, an OP healer, Zack, another superb finisher, Yuffie, the Fixed Dice whore and RedXIII!! --- Now jumping back to the present, I'm sure alot of players have hoarded for XG and Akstar banner. These will drain your resources by a ton. If you pull for them, will you have enough for the upcoming banners? I doubt so. We are talking heavy weighted lapis step ups here. As such, we absolutely **NEED** the WMR. And hey, if we do get the reset, we will surely work hard to get want right?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mini SYP - Cid</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-13 10:09:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**Disclaimer**](/tg): This only summarizes the main points I feel players should be aware of before diving into Cid's banner. It does not include the math because I'm not really a math wiz myself - I'll leave it to the experts to do that. [**Assumption**](/tg): No change in skillset for Cid. If there are critical changes that implicates the content of this thread, I will remove it myself. --- [JP Reddit Wiki Cid's Info](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1282/#label-green) --- Before /u/TomAto314 does his ~~Shitty~~ Stingy SYP or PPD and before the DHT gets flooded with related queries, this is what you should know: Cid is a **finisher**. He caps chains for immense burst damage. This means you **need** 2 chainers - whether it's Pod chains, Flood chains or Derp chains. Whatever. You absolutely NEED them to make him work at his optimal level. Sure he does alot of damage by himself. But without chainers, you lose out on chain modifiers which amplifies his damage. Next up, Cid **does not have** any form of imbues ~~or imperil~~ and requires external support for this. Units that provide imbue include: Unit | Element Imbue ---|---| [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[Emperor Shiera](#I/Icons/u845/)[CG Ignacio](#I/Icons/u1249/) | Fire [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[Christine](#I/Icons/u8106/) | Ice [Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[CG Sakura](#I/Icons/u793/)| Thunder [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/)[Seaside Nichol](#I/Icons/u8175/) | Water For more information, please refer to this [source](https://imgur.com/a/VVl4s). **Edit**: He does have a 75%-100% wind imperil. This affects your team composition. Who will you drop to imbue Cid? Are you able to make up for the loss of support through a friend unit? Do you have someone to imperil? As you can see, he requires quite some help from the team. If you lack imperil/imbue, you're basically screwed for most trials if you're using Cid. Third, because "GL is a different game", we will most likely be unable to stack his TMR. This hurts him a fair bit because you lose out an extra 75% jump damage and 50% TDH. Cid has innate 150% TDH. By stacking two of his TMRs, you gain a total of [**150% jump damage**](/tg) AND **100% TDH** so you'll need another Marshal Glove/KH Cloud Cape to hit the TDH cap. You also have an extra accessory to slot in Dragoon's Gauntlet or Farma's TM for added jump damage or additional ATK gear. Sadly, this won't be applicable in GL. To further add on, if you **do not have** Aranea's TM, you'll lose out on **another** 100% jump damage which cripples him severely. There are alternatives such as Dragon's Whisker or even AD Kain's STMR but you'd still lose out on 50% jump. This however, is a short-term problem because once the TDW meta hits, a DW build will be superior over TDH. On a side note, Cid can't be used in [Shinryu Trial](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a60u2z/jp_trial_shinryu_%E3%81%97%E3%82%93%E3%82%8A%E3%82%85%E3%81%86/) because of its anti-hide/jump mechanics and [Moon Kai](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9u2s6a/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bloody_moon/) for obvious reasons. --- ###Short SYP * If your team **cannot** maintain critical functions such as tanking, healing and damage mitigation while providing support to Cid at the same time, **SKIP**. You're way better off using a chainer and a friend chainer; plus, Akstar is next month. * If you do no have Aranea's TM, consider your options. Are you able to make up for that 100% loss in jump damage? We're getting Regina, another major finisher, in about ~3 months time. * If Dragoons are your love and pride, **PULL**. --- Relevant thread(s)/read-up(s): * [Finisher Damage Comparisons - Ang, Cid, Regina](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/arh4sl/finishers_damage_comparison_ang_cid_regina/) * [Resource Planning - Finishers](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ajbkug/advanced_resource_planning_finishers/) * [Scorn of Gilgamesh ft Cid](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/axw710/advanced_planning_scorn_of_gilgamesh_ft_cid/) --- Hope this helps. -AMHNN</TEXT>

Once ready, Pod chain, Cid lands, done. --- ###Ettin * Human Race * Buffs itself * ATK/MAG breaks work * Snorts if you use dispel/dispelga on him * Uses an AoE attack (not sure which element as Wilhelm has more than 100% on most of the elements) Complete the missions first. Ignacio removes buffs using Termination stamp whenever Ettin buffs and provides imbue for Cid. Raegen reapplies low value breaks after Ettin's buffs has been removed. Pod chain, Cid ands, done. I had Cid with double man eater (50%/75%) to increase the damage since Ettin's DEF/SPR cannot be broken. ##Gigarat * Beast Race * Copy + paste from Sieghard's Story Event * Uses AoE/ST physical attacks with elements * Fully breakable. Kill the Gigarat first, take out the minions later. Wilhelm easily soaks up the damage with an elemental resistance build. Cid's innate Beast killer stacked with Ifrit's Killer nodes work wonders. Raegen's 100% fire imperil is devastating here because Gigarat is innately weak to fire and doesn't stand a chance against Cid's stomp. Once the Gigarat is down, 2B uses her LB to clean up. --- **Note**: Technically speaking, the difficulty of the SE bonus stages got toned down so you **don't** actually **need** such ferocious firepower to complete it. I was fortunate to get Cid and decided to feature him just for fun.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Forewarning: One Cid may not be enough to nuke Gilgamesh</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-18 10:25:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone! I've been testing this for a while in anticipation of Gilgamesh Kai and discovered that ONE Cid may not be enough to kill Gilgamesh. The boss that I used for my tests is 3 #9733; Odin. Why? Because he has almost the same DEF as Gilgamesh with the latter edging out by 20 DEF and an extra 30,000,000 HP. Figures for comparison: Boss | HP | DEF ---|---|---| 3 #9733; Odin | 120,000,000 | 350 | Gilgamesh Kai | 150,000,000 | 370 | Over the course of 20 tests using the same setup, the damage I've collected is mildly infuriating. Build Used: Right hand: Stoss Spear ATK+140, ATK+27% (IW :ATK +15%, ATK +7%, ATK +5%) Head: Bombardier's Bicorne ATK+36, DEF+31 Body: Hyoh's Clothes ATK+28, DEF+42 Accessory 1: Marshal Glove ATK+40 Accessory 2: Cloud's Cloak (KH) ATK+40, DEF+10, SPR+10 Materia 1: Hero's Vow - Wind Materia 2: Sworn Six's Pride - Wind ATK+50% Materia 3: Man-Eater+ Materia 4: Man-Eater Esper: Diabolos HP+66, MP+76, ATK+31, DEF+44, MAG+68, SPR+43 Total: HP:8613, MP:428, ATK: 2016, DEF:434, MAG:262, SPR:335 --- Constant Parameters: Jump: 400% Killer: 300% (250% from equips + Diabolos esper, 50% from VoF's buff) TDH: 300% ATK: 217% Imperil: 100% Imbue: Yes Buff: 150% Chain: Flood x Violent Current (damage is negligbile because I was using Nichol as the Flood chainer) --- [**Note**](/tg): No DEF breaks were applied because Gilgamesh cannot be DEF/SPR broken. Damage is derived from chain capping. |Test|Damage| :--|--:| |1|128,804,002| |2|139,882,124| |3|**150,108,827**| |4|**158,907,532**| |5|140,673,029| |6|**159,018,129**| |7|130,448,762| |8|**150,788,163**| |9|**154,087,084**| |10|130,111,084| |11|140,184,559| |12|**158,799,512**| |13|143,332,189| |14|**157,891,103**| |15|128,944,128| |16|129,116,120| |17|142,405,899| |18|**158,989,167**| |19|136,555,087| |20|140,580,712| |Average|143,981,360| |Highest Roll|159,018,129| |Lowest Roll|128,804,002| --- Basically you need to have more than 2000 ATK with 400% jump, 250% killers to even stand a chance. I've also realized that the **two key equipments** which pushes your damage above the 2,000 mark is **Helmet/Hat** and **Body Armor/Clothes**. So if you're rocking with high ATK gears for them, you *should be* safe. The only way for you to find out is to continuously test and also pray for a high roll when the actual trial comes. I hope this helps players to gauge the level of gear and stats required if they're seeking to one shot Gilgamesh when he arrives. Alternatively, bring him down to slightly above ~80% and nuke him from there. Or... bring 2 Cids! Lol -AMHNN</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Welcome to another GL Monthly Outlook!

This is another series that needs more love! Speaking of which, aren #8217;t we getting [Final Fantasy Brave Exvius  #8211; War of the Visions](https://youtu.be/JILc20CZ1Lo) this year or something? [Ultima](#I/Icons/u1270/) Ultima (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% MAG w/ Hat  amp; +30% MAG w/ Robe) [STMR](/#label-red): **Dagger** (+98 ATK, +167 MAG  amp; Damage Boost to "Ultima") **Summary**: Ultima chains with the AT, CW and Tornado family. She #8217;s a strong mage that comes with on-demand W-cast and is able to unlock quad-cast through her LB and Trust Ability. One of her CD is a decaying debuff which starts at a **massive -80% SPR** which gradually drops to 50% value. When paired with other mages like Elly, she absolutely destroys. Against enemies that are immune to non-elemental damage however, her damage will drop significantly. On a side note, she has one [heck of a LB animation](https://youtu.be/b9Y4Mgn4lD0?t=179)! --- [Beowulf](#I/Icons/u1273/) Beowulf (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% ATK, +20% HP/MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **1h Greatsword** (+168 ATK, +127 MAG) **Summary**: Beowulf #8217;s LB is a ST 74% full break at maxed level. His kit consists of decaying debuffs and ice/dark imperils which he can all W-cast. He is also able to chain with both AT and Octaslash families. Note that his chaining skills cannot be W-cast so if you #8217;re looking to pair him with other relevant chainers, you #8217;ll probably need to run him as a DW unit. --- [Reis](#I/Icons/u1276/) Reis **TMR**: **Materia** (+40% MAG  amp; +30% Fire/Ice/Thunder Resist) **Summary**: Triple elemental resistance with 40% MAG boost is a great pickup especially with the upcoming elemental tetris trials. You get the relevant resistance and maintain your damage if you #8217;re a mage. --- [Construct 8](#I/Icons/u1279/) Construct 8 **TMR**: **Materia** (-20% ATK/MAG, +30% DEF/SPR) **Summary**: TMR looks for tanks with a boost in both DEF and SPR stats. --- FFT is on the standard 25k step-up with guaranteed Ultima or Beowulf on the last step. More info found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8niyc0/jp_final_fantasy_tactics_4_pickup_thread_61_614/) --- #Banner 2  #8211; Akstar Story Event [CG Akstar](#I/Icons/u1324/) Akstar (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIzdTzaUz3A/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+40 ATK, +50% LB Fill Rate +25% Accuracy +50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Katana** (+180 ATK, +50% Accuracy, 1.05x~1.55x Dmg Var) **Summary**: At last, the next big leap in damage for chainers is finally here! Akstar predominantly uses AT chaining skills while having access to DR and AR chains too. He is able to imbue himself with either fire/ice and has to build up stacks on his AT skill which can be further amplified by his LB resulting in an eventual 90x mod burst with T-cast. This is [his optimal rotation](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/akstarrotation): * T1: CD (120 MP) + Imperil (72MP) * T2: Imbue (42MP) + Recover HP/MP (56MP) + 48MP * T3: Stack [1] + Stack [2] + Stack [3] (62MP) * T4: LB * T5: CD (90 MP) + Stack [4] + Stack [4] (62MP) * T6: Stack [4] + Stack [4] + Stack [4] (62MP) Because of how his damage is heavily reliant on building up and maintaing stacks, it is [**absolutely critical**](/tg) that he doesn #8217;t die else you #8217;ll have to ramp up his damage all over again. **Is he future-proof?** [**Yes**](/gt). Akstar will last a good 3-4months+ before the TDW meta sets in with CG Lightning and CG Bartz. He has yet to receive his enhancements in JP as well so that should be something worth looking forward to. --- [Gravie](#I/Icons/u1327/) Gravie **TMR**: **Materia** (+50% ATK with Katana  amp; +20% ATK w/ Clothes) **Summary**: His TMR is an essential pickup if you #8217;re going in for Akstar. 70% ATK boost is massive. --- [Tomoe](#I/Icons/u1330/) Tomoe **TMR**: **2h Gun** (+130 ATK, +70% Accuracy, 1.3x~1.7x Dmg Var) **Summary**: If you #8217;re planning for Regina, this is good gun to pick up if you #8217;ve missed out on Linebacker G-87 MSGL from Deus EX Event or don #8217;t have any guns in your arsenal like Machine Gun+ , Sparky etc. This is an obvious pass if you #8217;ve already gotten NG Jake #8217;s STMR or Vincent #8217;s STMR. --- [Majora](#I/Icons/u1333/) Majora **TMR**: **Accessory** (+3 DEF/SPR, +20% HP/MP  amp; 5% Auto-Refresh) **Summary**: Nice accessory for support units with decent HP/MP and auto-refresh. --- Akstar is a 25k lapis step up banner with a guaranteed chance of getting him on the last step. Banner info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8xmsb4/jp_story_event_23_banners_megathread_710720/) For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Akstar Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information- [Excerpt from JP megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8xmsb0/jp_story_event_23_event_megathread_710720/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app): * 1st Wave: [**Chimera Brain**](https://i.imgur.com/3FCDdTj.png) (Beast). Can be paralyzed. Fully Breakable. It uses attacks with paralyzing effects so plan accordingly. * 2nd Wave: [**Amalthea**](https://i.imgur.com/DEmvvtY.png) (Machine). DEF/SPR breakable. Uses mainly physical attacks so a dodge tank will help. * 3rd Wave: [**Evil Drake**](https://i.imgur.com/wcXCmEt.png) (Dragon). Fully breakable. Can be poisoned. Uses ST death so bring along safety bit/genji shield/genji armor. --- #Banner 3  #8211; FFBE Orders Back to back Raids are possible and have happened before. So we might get these units next month alongside a Raid. [Nagi](#I/Icons/u1297/) Nagi (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+35 ATK/MAG, +10 DEF, +12 SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+20% ATK, +50% MAG, 60% TDW) **Summary**: Nagi chains with the AR, DR and Graviton Cannon (GC) families. She comes with innate DW and her attacks are all hybrid based. While her STMR provides an incredible TDW boost, it isn #8217;t worth chasing because down the road, CG Lightning will oust her completely with her 100% TDW TMR. --- [Yego](#I/Icons/u1300/) Yego (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+20% MP, +40% ATK w/ Whip, +25% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Whip** (+176 ATK +50% Acc, Damage Variance: 1.05x~1.55x) **Summary**: Yego is probably the one and only hardcore whip user. She comes with on-demand W-ability and chains with the Pile Driver family. Remember [Shinju](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Shinju)? Her TMR will benefit Yego greatly. Other than that, she is hardly if not ever used in JP #8230; --- [Zolulu  amp; Delulu](#I/Icons/u1303/) Zolulu  amp; Delulu **TMR**: **Materia** (+20% ATK, +40% SPR w/ Instrument, +30% ATK w/ Bow) **Summary**: A bard unit with a 70% SPR debuff LB. --- [Galas](#I/Icons/u1306/) Galas **TMR**: **2h Greatsword** (+130 ATK, +10% DEF, +50% Acc, Damage Variance: 1x~1.6x) **Summary**: TMR is literally Revolving Saw v2 with an extra 10% DEF. --- Raid banner is on a 15,000 Lapis lap (max: 1) with a guaranteed Nagi or Yego on the last step. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8sgjvw/jp_620630_banners_ffbe_orders_pickup_thread/) --- #Trials  amp; Espers I #8217;ve updated this section to give a macro view of all the upcoming trials and to see how far we actually are behind our JP counterpart. Trials are a **crucial aspect** of the game that we actually want. I mean what's the point when we have all the shiny new units and nowhere to play with them right? |No.|Chamber of Fallen|Chamber of Indignant (Scorn/Kai)| --:|:--|:--| |Next in Line|[Dark Shiva/Golem](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8filpq/jp_trial_18_dark_espers_ii_dark_shiva_dark_golem/)|[Dark Siren/Ifrit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8vq8ka/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_dark_espers_ifrit_and_siren/)| |2|[Shinryu](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a60u2z/jp_trial_shinryu_%E3%81%97%E3%82%93%E3%82%8A%E3%82%85%E3%81%86/)|[Ultros/Typhon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/93jgs8/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_ultros_typhon/)| |3|-|[Lich](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9celt8/jp_trial_20_lich/)| |4|-|[Glacial Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9kw851/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_glacial/)| |5||[Bloody Moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9u2s6a/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bloody_moon/)| |6|-|[Elafikeras](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a1emof/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_elafikeras/)| |7|-|[Aigaion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/afdtcj/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_aigaion_kai/)| |8|-|[Iron Giant](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aq2re6/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_iron_giant/)| |9|-|[Bomb Family](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b0bhpv/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bomb_family/)| --- Series Boss Battle (SBB) is a new set of trials released together with a specific FF series.

A place where we have to **work hard** for time-limited rainbows! XG Part I is confirmed this week as seen [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b4ajl6/xenogears_confirmed_next_week/). /u/TomAto314 can finally open his flood gates for Elly! Good luck bro! As for XG Part II, I am hoping that they will release it on the first week of April for obvious reasons. Honestly speaking, XG is a lapis sink before Akstar #8217;s banner. /s The next upcoming collab after XG to look forward to is Octopath Traveller! Square Enix recently announced that they #8217;ll be releasing its prequel for mobile devices. It #8217;ll be a single player RPG that retains the 2D HD visual style of the Switch RPG. It will be released this year in Japan. No confirmations have been made for NA release though. --- ###Xenogears II Part I of Xenogears has been confirmed at last! We are now left with Part II. These are the units: [Citan](#I/Icons/u1261/) Citan (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK with Fist/ Katana  amp; 50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **Katana** (+176 ATK, +20% ATK  amp; +75% Phys/Mag Damage vs Humans) **Summary**: Water elemental AT chainer. Has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. Citan also rocks a solid innate 150% TDH and is an [extremely powerful chainer to date.](https://youtu.be/ummtbDr4Juo?t=317) There #8217;s a solid breakdown of his kit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8l8i4d/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_citan/) --- [Maria](#I/Icons/u1264/) Maria (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+30 DEF, +52 MAG  amp; +40% Light Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG with Rod, +30% MP/MAG  amp; 5 LB/Turn) **Summary**: The ultimate [fister](https://youtu.be/yFL5rskgjQg?t=583). Her LB makes [regular Aigaion her bitch](https://youtu.be/qsTvBOu2zF4?t=19). Not sure about Aigaion Kai though... --- [Billy](#I/Icons/u1267/) Billy **TMR**: **Gun** (+130 ATK, +20 SPR) **Summary**: LB provides +80% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resistance and comes with innate DW. He also imperils earth by 60% in his chaining skill. --- Part II of Xenogears has a 15k lapis step-up banner: * Step 1: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; Guaranteed Billy * Step 2: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1.5x 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Rates * Step 3: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1x Guaranteed Random 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Unit More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8kz4t0/jp_521531_banners_xenogears_collab_2_pickup_thread/) --- ###Octopath Traveler Octopath Traveler is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released worldwide on July 13, 2018 and was collaborated with FFBE JP almost simultaneously. These are the units: [Primrose](#I/Icons/u1336/) Primrose (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+16 DEF, +40 SPR, +40% SPR, +100% Petrify Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG, +60% SPR  amp; 80% Chance Ignore up to 1 Fatal Attacks when HP above 40%) **Summary**: Primrose is like Soleil v10. She #8217;s is an insane buffer with 200% stat boosts in her LB along with AoE HP/MP heals over time and AoE LB fill. She comes with on-demand W-cast for her dances. Her regular dance moves provide 130% stat boosts and her CD ability comes with 40% damage mitigation that unlocks 160% stat boosts. She can even provide charm protection as a bonus. Her kit also includes killer boosts for Beasts/Dragons/Plants/Spirits, dark imbue (which can be W-cast) and dark imperil. The only thing she really lacks is an assortment of elemental resistance buffs. Other than that, she is a solid buffer for any team. --- [Olberic](#I/Icons/u1339/) Olberic (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% HP, +20% DEF, +100% Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Light Armor** (+1000 HP, +62 DEF, +55 SPR, +20% ATK/DEF) **Summary**: Olberic is a physical tank with innate provoke and 50% draw. His LB has a 40% damage mitigation. His CD unlocks a better cover ability with up to 80% damage reduction. As a plus, he can chain with the AR family which AoE debuffs by 80% wind/earth and he is capable of ST breaking for 60% value. His STMR has an insane 1,000 HP with decent DEF/SPR stats and a 20% DEF boost. Considering how we didn #8217;t get Gabranth whose STMR is a helmet with +1000 HP +18 ATK +81 DEF and +20% HP, this can be considered a great addition for anyone building up the ultimate beefy tank. --- [Therion](#I/Icons/u1342/) Therion **TMR**: **Accessory** (+12 ATK, +26 DEF, +30% Camouflage, +20% Physical Evade) **Summary**: TMR is excellent for dodge builds if you didn #8217;t farm Twenty-sided Die or don #8217;t have Ring of Lucii. --- [Tressa](#I/Icons/u1345/) Tressa **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% ATK/MAG, +25% EXP gained from battles) **Summary**: A good addition to EXP items for levelling units. --- Octopath Traveler had a ticket campaign where players would receive 1 Primrose/Olberic Ticket for every 10+1 summon done and can exchange for a Primrose/Olberic of choice with 5 ticket pieces. There was also a [**one-time**](/tg) 5,000 Lapis with a **guaranteed either Primrose/Olberic**. You don #8217;t get any Primrose/Olberic tickets for this one though.

    <TITLE>Advanced Planning (Nutshell ver.): Scorn of Dark Espers - Siren/Ifrit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-31 21:02:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Welcome to another advanced planning thread! This time we look at the next upcoming Chamber of the Indignant Trial: Scorn of the Dark Espers - Siren/Ifrit aka the start of **Elemental Tetris** trials! Special Shoutout to /u/Sinzar_ for helping me! #What is Elemental Tetris? Basically gearing your units with multiple elemental resistance in order to survive the fight. Materias like Melody of Life, True Hydaelyn Guard or Equipments like Cat Ear Hood, Rainbow Robe etc comes to into good use. I'll compress what I know based on original JP thread found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8vq8ka/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_dark_espers_ifrit_and_siren/) to summarize what you will need in a nutshell. If you have more information, feel free to comment below and I'll add them in! #Dark Siren/Ifrit Mission | Reward ---|---| Clear | **1 handed Fist** (+173 ATK  amp; +75% Phys Damage vs Aqua) 6+ Lightning Damage | 10% Trust Moogle No Items | 50x Trust Coins Summon Leviathan  amp; Phoenix | 1/10 UoC Ticket Based on the JP thread, there are 2 methods to deal with this trial: 1. Magic Tank Route 2. Full Evade Physical Cover Tank Route --- #Magic Tank Route What you will need: * An Evade Provoker (eg. Tidus, Noctis) with/without Golem Esper * An AoE Mirage User (eg. 7 #9733; Bart, Sara, 7 #9733; Jiraiya) * Magic Tank * Ailment Resist (including Charm/Stop) --- Now we dive a little deeper to see how much resistance is actually needed! Unit | [](#Z/Icons/z1/) | [](#Z/Icons/z4/) | [](#Z/Icons/z8/) ---|---|---|--| Magic Tank | 140% | 140% | 140% | Yup, you saw that right. 140% resistance **each** for [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt)/[**dark**](/ca) because Siren/Ifrit constantly imperils your team with 25%~40% fire/water/dark. As for the rest of your units, they will need a **combined** resistance of 200% across [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt)/[**wind**](/ga)/[**dark**](/ca) [**Dark**](/ca) element should be your main priority since most of the bosses attack are predominantly dark element that may or may not come together with [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt) elements. An example of gearing your unit would be: Element | Resistance ---|---| [](#Z/Icons/z1/) | 30% [](#Z/Icons/z4/) | 50% [](#Z/Icons/z5/) | 50% [](#Z/Icons/z8/) | 70% or Element | Resistance ---|---| [](#Z/Icons/z1/) | 30% [](#Z/Icons/z4/) | 20% [](#Z/Icons/z5/) | 50% [](#Z/Icons/z8/) | 100% If you combine these with external [**green magic**](/gg) buffs like Barfiraga, Barwaterga etc with 70% resistance, your team will take **zero** damage. You may also wanna consider using the elemental resistance from **Esper Nodes** to get that extra % resistance. **Every little bit of resistance counts!** --- #Physical Evade Cover Tank Route What you will need: * A physical evade cover tank lol * Ailment Resist (including Charm/Stop) * All units geared with sufficient resistances across [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt)/[**dark**](/ca) elements. Because you do not have a magic tank, you have to be able to reach at least [**300%**](/tg) resistance across [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt)/[**dark**](/ca) elements. Remember that they imperil you for maximum of 120% (40% each in [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt)/[**dark**](/ca)) so having **220%** resistance combined is the bare minimum **excluding** buffs. --- #Critical Information Your entire party will also need a total of [**400%**](/tg) across [**fire**](/tg)/[**water**](/gt)/[**wind**](/ga)/[**dark**](/ca) to survive Siren/Ifrit's duo **uncoverable** nuke on **Turn 5**. Nothing less than 400% otherwise your party will be wiped. Units like Raegen with his [Soul Blazer](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Soul_Blazer) (50% across fire/water/wind/dark) essentially provides an added **200%** to your team. Similarly, [Calamity Border](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Calamity_Border) provides 40% across fire/water/wind/dark for a total of 160% resistance. --- #General Guidelines * Siren can be ATK/MAG broken. Immune to DEF/SPR breaks. Innate -300% Lightning Resist * Ifrit can be DEF/SPR broken. Immune to ATK/MAG breaks. Innate -300% Water Resist * Kill Siren first and don't use lightning attacks **except on turns with multiples of 5** else she'll counter with **uncoverable** wind/lightning damage. * Ifrit will counter with an **uncoverable** AoE physical if you pass 2 thresholds in one turn. The thresholds are 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%. * Ifrit uses a coverable/dodgeable AoE physical **once every turn** when his HP is above 60% and **twice every turn** when its below 60% HP. So it would be best to nuke him from 61% onwards to finish the fight especially if you are using the magic tank route. --- #Bonus Links If you've read everything up till this point (or not) here are some clear videos which I found very helpful in my research.

    <TITLE>PSA: FD 2B LB Spammers, don't forget to equip War Goddess Insignia</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-02 00:47:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Or if you're just any other LB spammer like Hyoh for that matter. The extra 1.3x LB damage is pretty significant; more so if you have Squall's STMR and/or Bahamut's Tear. Plus to top it off, it comes with an extra 30% ATK. So if you've already cleared Asura's Trial, put this to good use! This materia will also work marvelously on [Regina](https://exvius.gg/jp/units/100017505/), a top tier finisher who's coming in June. On a side note, we're gonna get another **1.5x LB damage** materia from a 4 #9733; unit [Kyanos](https://exvius.gg/jp/units/100020704/) next month. I didn't know what I was missing until I got that prism for 2B from the Trust Coin Shop, awakened her to 7 #9733;, near maxed her LB, used a FD build and started going around trials testing and melting everyone. Glory to mankind!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: Elly-less players, don't forget about Barbariccia for Dark Shiva/Golem</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-02 14:47:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Well if you didn't drop a single lapis for Elly like myself but want to prep for this Thursday's Dark Shiva/Golem, it's time to bust out your Barbariccias. [Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8filpq/jp_trial_18_dark_espers_ii_dark_shiva_dark_golem/) to JP thread. [**Dark Golem**](/tt) has innate **-700% Wind Resist** and a meagre **100 SPR**. By equipping her with Ramuh esper with M.Stone Killer node, her own TMR and Grand Star accessory from Warden Welter, you're looking at a **170% M.Stone Killer**. If you've learnt Stone Killer+ on Golem, that'll be **195% M.Stone Killer**. She would most probably be able to wipe Golem in a single move using 80% to 150% value buffs and dupe chaining using Tempest Eye Wall and a Tornado Aeroja follow up. Not to mention this ability packs an extra **120%** wind imperil and has a 12x chaining mod. * Total Wind imperil: **820%** * Total M.Stone Killer: **170%- 195%** Meanwhile, Elly has to pathetically stack her Anemo Wave while Barb blows her away. /s I'm kidding. 2 Ellys will send Golem to Dwayne Johnson for pickup. Golem? What Golem? All I see is Zadehl Golemsands. --- **Bonus**: [**Dark Shiva**](/gt) has innate **-700% fire resist** and a laughable **200 DEF**. Plus she's human race... Who comes to mind? A giant oaf with the warmest heart of a blacksmith. Flame Veritas. Of course his armorless form would work excellently too. With Muramasa, Man Eater+, Man Eater and Brave Soul, he packs a whopping 300% human killer. No Muramasa? No worries! He has a 50% human killer buff! Oh and did I mention he has a 40x fire nuke as well? Who needs a RNG Leading Man when you have a **Real Man** who eats big and loves to smash? /s --- **Bonus Bonus**: My builds for both FV and Barb: Barbariccia 7 #9733; (**170% M.Stone Killer**) Right hand: Wizard Rod+ MP+15%, ATK+22, MAG+125, MAG+32% (IW :Rare lvl3, MAG +10%, MAG +7%) Left hand: Glory of Evil MP+15%, ATK+92, MAG+120, MAG+28% (IW :Rare lvl3, MAG +10%, MAG +3%) Head: Royal Crown DEF+16, MAG+50, SPR+32 Body: Sakura's Robe DEF+14, MAG+77, SPR+42 Accessory 1: Genji Glove ATK+10%, MAG+10% Accessory 2: Grand Star ATK+25, DEF+25, MAG+25, SPR+25 Materia 1: Barbariccia's Spirit HP+30% Materia 2: Rod Mastery MAG+50% Materia 3: Sage of Mysidia MP+20%, MAG+40% Materia 4: Distant Promise MAG+40% Esper: Ramuh HP+44, MP+80, ATK+36, DEF+29, MAG+80, SPR+65 Total: HP:8586, MP:753, ATK:376, DEF:286, MAG:1743, SPR:509 Veritas of the Flame 7 #9733; (**300% Human Killer**) Right hand: Moon Axe ATK+125, ATK+35% (IW :Rare lvl3, ATK +5%) Left hand: Muramasa (FFBE) HP+15%, ATK+172, ATK+25% (IW :Rare lvl3, ATK +10%) Head: Ignacio's Helm ATK+21, DEF+20 Body: Genji Armor (FFBE) ATK+20, ATK+30%, DEF+45 Accessory 1: Genji Glove ATK+10%, MAG+10% Accessory 2: Desch's Earring ATK+45 Materia 1: Man-Eater+ Materia 2: Man-Eater Materia 3: Brave Soul ATK+30% Materia 4: Sworn Six's Pride - Fire ATK+60% Esper: Diabolos HP+66, MP+76, ATK+31, DEF+44, MAG+68, SPR+43 Total: HP:11037, MP:442, ATK:1754, DEF:549, MAG:272, SPR:329 --- Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Riding the Power Wave and its Implications</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-03 19:37:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Warning**: Wall of Text incoming. As many of you know, Akstar is due as part of this month's SE. He represents the next big power leap in physical chaining, far superior to the likes of Hyoh and Jecht. Self imbue, imperil, abilities boosting his main chaining ability before nuking etc. More importantly is how he also marks a point where the TDH meta freezes until it defrosts ever so mildly during CG Rain's debut. This is coincidentally the same time where the game decides to introduce a new meta - True Dual Wield or TDW as we call it. TDW is exactly similar to TDH, just under a different flag so to speak. We get core units like CG Lightning with her 100% TDW materia and later on CG Bartz with his 50% TDW accessory, much like how we got Cloud and Elfreeda introducing the TDH meta last year. And sadly, we will most likely not be able to stack CG Lightning's TMR. The main difference between TDW and TDH meta is the adjustment of the chaining mechanic wherein the chain modifier for TDW units goes from 4x to 6x to match TDH units with 2h weapons that provide a certain degree of damage variance. The other difference is the cap. Unlike TDH, TDW is capped out at 200% (for now). In our current list of units, you might have already noticed some units like Aloha Lasswell giving some small % of TDW with their TMR/STMRs. The transition from TDH to TDW is quite massive. You start to see modifiers skyrocketing. Like REALLY shooting into the stratosphere. Just when you thought Akstar's 90x modifier after his LB was insane, CG Lightning gives Akstar a run for his money with her damage pretty much on par or edging his out depending on what gears you have. Then comes CG Bartz with his 125x modifier after all his multiple power up boosts. The damage race starts increasing at an exponential rate before you know it. CG Onion Knight's modifier goes up to 129x ish and you'll start to see more 3k ATK units in your companion list. What does this mean? **Content needs to match the prowess of the new units**. By now, you should know that the game's life is centered around damage dealing and pumping out units that do more along with content that is more difficult. Pause that and everything stagnates. Players lose interest and start leaving. Problem one. While the game does breathe some life into older units like Hyoh and Jecht with ability enhancements, they eventually fall off your team when you get better, shinier units to play with. The bad news is, with the shinier toys being introduced, the game also decides to go hard on how we obtain them aka by making us really work hard for the units we want by **not allowing us to UoC them**. This "trend" starts with CG Dark Fina and now CG Onion Knight, where players are literally forced to go ham with their lapis to obtain their desired units; worse if its a split banner. If GL adopts JP's business model, **there's less reason to be holding onto UoC tickets from now till then.** Problem two. Next, the number of UoC tickets given out is decreasing to pave way for their new business model. You get fewer tickets from MK events and can only select that many units from the pool. Problem three. With the UoC you have on hand, instead of mindlessly using it on units like Trance Terra (you have no idea how many players I've seen UoC her on facebook when we just got the UoC system. God bless em.) **UoCs are much better used on non-damage dealers**. Use them on support units, tanks, buffers. These are the pivotal units in your team! Without them, one cannot take on new trials at all. Thankfully, being GL, we have the huge advantage of clairvoyance unlike JP so planning is significantly easier. You can look into the future and see what units you want and plan your resources for them accordingly. But that's just about it. We don't get anymore 1 ups unless they choose to give it to us like GLEX enhancements, GLEX events etc. TL;DR: A change is coming. And not a good one. Lapis becomes so much more important in the future and UoC is better used for support units.</TEXT>

Unit | Role ---|---| [Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/) | Magic Tank with 150% ice/earth/dark resist [Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/) | Full Evade Provoke [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/) | Buffer [Fire Veritas](#I/Icons/u575/) | DW Fire Finisher with 300% Human Killer [Barbariccia](#I/Icons/u1315/)[Barbariccia](#I/Icons/u1315/)| Wind Chainers with 170%+ M.Stone Killers With 2 Barbs, I *almost* nailed Golem on the first turn if only Shiva didn't Charm Wilhelm... Then I could have used Nichol's Heroic Stance for a better buff value. So I made do with FV's Inspire buff instead. Golem put up mitigation for 3 turns so I basically turtled while stacking Raging Wind until it fell off. A.Rain tanked those elemental attacks like a baus. Wilhelm maintained provoke while Nichol continued buffing to ensure regen to the team. Once the mitigation fell off, 2 Barbs killed Golem with Raging Wind then it's time to take on Shiva. With Golem dead, Shiva can only spam her AoE ice/dark magic while using the usual ST attacks which Wilhelm took care of. She also sucked his MP for one turn but with Nichol around, that was handle easily. I didn't push Shiva past the 80% threshold to prevent any nasty new attacks from happening so I basically stalled (again) until my esper gauge was full. **Note**: Shiva uses her AoE physical at 50% HP threshold. Once that was done, FV buffed himself and melted Shiva with Red Inferno capping tornado chains. PS: The esper animation kill didn't happen at the end so I had to soft reset for the mission but otherwise the kill was secured. Thanks /u/Wookash92 for your Barb!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Repercussions of no Akstar this month</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-09 11:49:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>First off, I'm amazed **and** shocked that they'll swap a highly anticipated Story Event just like that. Usually SE are set in stone almost strictly adhering to JP's timeline. But now that Gumi pulled a Barry Allen on us, we need to consider the repercussions of their actions. DAMMIT BARRY!! **Powercreep Wave**: Pushing Akstar back a month means he's a step closer to the TDW meta. Instead of reigning for ~4 months, he now has ~3 months on the Iron Throne assuming they don't bring forward CG Lightning. TDH or TDW, TDH or TDW, TDH or TDW. FUCK!! **Lapis Woes**: With Akstar delayed, this also means that we'll get Regina the month following Akstar. And **then CG Charlotte** thereafter! Not to mention **FF7 with Aerith, RedXIII, Zack  amp; Yuffie** during that same period as well. Oof. 2nd Quarterly Sales target for Gumi. Ez. **Trial Content**: Nothing much changes here. Even though Scorn of Siren/Ifrit is released this Friday, no Akstar doesn't mean we can't clear it. We've got /u/Sinzar_ to set the precedence! And looking at Asura, many of us cleared it without Akstar as well. We'll probably get GLEX clears and stuff too. **Easter**: Due to a GLEX Easter announced in their prior video, this may form part of the reason why Akstar was delayed. Perhaps release a unit that'll powercreep Akstar before his debut? No one knows! We might even see an Easter version of Akstar before the original one! Lol **DHT**: This daily thread is about to be swarmed with "Should I save for Akstar or CG Lightning??", "Who do I UoC now?! Akstar or Bartz?!". Congrats Gumi. Not only did you inflict **Confusion**, you also **Stopped** our Decision Making, **Blinding** our eyes with the sheer ninja move, **Poisoning** our minds, **Paralyzing** our choices and causing us to be **Stoned** altogether. All in all, this was a totally unexpected curveball. Is this their way of countering my GL Monthly Clairvoyance?! Challenge accepted. Cheers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: Consider learning % Element Resist on your Esper for Scorn of Siren/Ifrit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-09 12:47:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>With Scorn of Siren/Ifrit coming up, every bit of resistance counts! If your esper doesn't have killers or any key abilities, consider learning their % resist nodes. For example, I've learnt Beast Killer/+ and both fire resist nodes. So my DPS unit gets both the killers and an additional 20% fire resist!

    <TITLE>[Alternative Guide] Crimson Bonus Stage 9/9 Missions ft Blossom Sage Sakura</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-12 20:33:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full Clear: https://youtu.be/Kn7bGd9ogJk Equipment [here](https://youtu.be/Kn7bGd9ogJk?t=1264) Team Used: |Unit|Role| :--|:--| |[Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/)|Evade Provoke| |[Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/)|Magic Cover Tank (High Fire/Ice/Thunder % resistance)| |[CG Sakura](#I/Icons/u793/)|Thunder Finisher| |[CG Folka](#I/Icons/u1207/)|Healer/Ailment  amp; Break Resist Buff| |[2B](#I/Icons/u774/)[2B](#I/Icons/u774/)|TDH FD DPS (any other physical chainer works)| --- My team comp has very few mages and I lack Trance Terra 7 #9733;, Elly 7 #9733;, Sophia 7 #9733; and Ultima 7 #9733; so chaining Chaos Wave is a myth to me. My main mages are Sakura 7 #9733; and Barbariccia 7 #9733;. In this fight, I chose Sakura as a finisher. So if you're like me who don't usually run with magic chainers, this strategy may work for you. --- ###1st Wave: Snatcher (Spirit) Snatcher has extremely high DEF so don't bother using a physical DPS. However it has low SPR and 200% resistance to all elements. It has a rotational self-imperil debuff (fire/ice/lightning). I used Sakura with V-cast Quick Final Thunder to cap 2B's thunder-imbued True Charge Blade for large amounts of damage when it's vulnerable to thunder. ~~Then it's basically a waiting game for the boss to rotate to fire/ice debuff for the mission~~ I wasted time because I did not know that the damage counts even if resisted lol. I used Phoenix Esper for fire damage and White Fang (Item) for ice damage. A.Rain maintains his cover, Wilhelm on provoke and Folka rotates between ailment protection and heals. Make sure to heal everyone to full because the next boss starts with a pre-emptive strike on your team. --- ###2nd Wave: Cursed Knight (Undead) Cursed Knight will imbue your team with fire element, to which he absorbs and will counter both physical and magical DPS. Folka used Bushido Freedom to clear the enemy imbue and I used 2B's thunder imbue True Charge Blade and Sakura's Quick Final Thunder for a Quick Kill. Again, heal everyone before proceeding because the next boss will strike first. --- ###3rd Wave: Heartburn (Demon) Heartburn starts with a pre-emptive dark imbue on your team and summons 2 of its minions, both of which are 100% resistant to light. Heartburn itself has 100% light/dark/earth resistance. I used Bushido Freedom to clear the enemy dark imbue and used 2B's thunder imbued LB to clear the minions. Thereafter, imperil Heartburn for 100% thunder with True Charge Volt and capped Sakura's Quick Final Thunder for the kill. --- Hope this helps anyone who are short of strong magic chainers! Cheers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Thought on Upcoming DD Banners</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-15 23:37:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>With Gumi's attempt to smoothen out the powercreep by swapping Crimson and Akstar, I had a thought on the upcoming damage dealer banners. Highlighting key units assuming the order isn't interrupted (again):  gt; Akstar  #8594; Regina  #8594; CG Lightning  #8594; CG Bartz  #8594; CG Onion Knight We all know how the damage game works. Units get progressively more powerful with their ever growing skill modifiers, more impressive numbers, higher DPT etc. BUT, have we stopped to consider their **survivability**? Unless you're solely pulling for units to do the Story Mode and recurring events like Story Events or Mog King Events, then this probably won't apply to you as much. But a large number of us would very much like to use the new units to clear trials. Take the next meta finisher as a base example. By now, we already know her pros: * Easy to gear * High per turn damage * High backloaded LB damage * No damage stacking required But her major con? Her HP. She's **squishy as fuck**. Regina Cannon? More like Glass Cannon. Comparing the above mentioned units based on their HP using the data from ExviusDB: Unit | HP | DEF | SPR ---|---|---|---| [Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/) | 6,198 | 193 | 193 [CG Akstar](#I/Icons/u1324/) | 7,007 | 278 | 349 [CG Lightning](#I/Icons/u1445/) | 8,385 | 342 | 328 [(CG) Light Warrior Bartz](#I/Icons/u1481/) | 8,572 | 278 | 337 [CG Onion Knight](#I/Icons/u1577/) | 9,130 | 360 | 352 [**Note**](/tg): HP/DEF/SPR values are Pots + Passives. HP gets even more important over damage as trials get harder with more instances of uncoverable damage and RNG-based attacks; even more so for mages who're naturally squishy (points to Elly). You need a good amount of health to survive atop buffs and mitigation. For someone like Regina, who already requires a certain degree of team support, she **dies very easily**. For her to have a better chance at surviving the later trials, you might need Gutsy Items like Queen's STMR or Chocobo Fina's STMR. While a good re-raise may initially seemingly solve the issue, let's not forget that she can be killed from an uncoverable stray attack after getting raised. Then you'll have to raise her while babysitting the rest of your team. If you get caught up at a critical threshold and forgot to rebuff buffs/mitigation, that's even worse. With the TDW meta, units will be wielding **two weapons** (duh). That means having a potential extra 15%/20% HP stat from Item World which is **huge**. An additional 2-3k HP can mean the difference between a successful or a failed trial. How many times did you wish your unit survived that extra unforeseen ST attack? How many times were you a few % away from clearing a trial and got screwed over just because you did not have enough HP on your DD? TL;DR: Don't focus purely on the damage units bring. Consider the unit's survivability as well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"GL is a different game" is now no longer a meme</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-18 21:20:36</DATE>
    <TEXT> gt; GL is a different game is a term we use so often that it is no longer an annoying meme. It now has a **literal meaning** and it's something that alot of us have come to accept. We may have the clairvoyance across 9 months but that foresight cannot defend us against random super powercreeps that Gumi decides to drop on us. We may hoard for Akstar ever since his debut, withholding all tickets and lapis just for him, ~~but if Gumi so much as drops someone like Esther, and if the damage calculation has already been mathed out by not one, but several people, it would simply be illogical and irrational to **not** pull for her if she covers your physical DPS role all the way until JP's strongest present unit which is about 8-9 months at best.~~ She's slightly stronger than Akstar but far lower compared to Lightning and Bartz. The same can be said for Sylvie. Absolutely bonkers LB that would render upcoming elemental tetris trials a joke (except maybe for the ambush mechanics), considerably strong buffs, anti-break/ailment resistances etc. ~~That being said, some of us may hate on this move because we were under the impression that Gumi is "smoothening out" the powercreep by introducing Crimson first instead of Akstar when in reality, that banner was actually setting up for Esther if you've pulled for Kyanos.~~ Let us face it- **GL is a different game**. We've got exclusive units and fan-made units that JP doesn't. Likewise in JP, they can stack similar materias whereas we can't in GL. ~~We get a super powercreep for Easter while JP is slowly rolling out the older FF units who aren't really beating Bartz in terms of damage anyway.~~ ~~I for one, am open to even using UoC for Esther if it solves my DPS problem over such a long time. For someone who's always looking into the future with the monthly outlooks and contemplating who to hoard for, trust me when I say this banner is superb for anyone - newbies and veterans alike. Again, this is assuming both units' skill values remain untouched by tonight.~~ welp. They nerfed her lmao. I ain't pulling for sure lol. ~~I'm also open to the fact that Gumi would hopefully introduce some GLEX trial later on for us to use as Esther's playpen. That said, it wouldn't suck as bad if they didn't- even the most powerful units bend to the will of RNG mechanics in trials. Tank or burst all you want but if the game AI decides to screw you over, there's nothing much you can do. On a side note, you may eventually get bored using the same ol' unit that has a shelf-life of 9 months as your primary DPS.~~ ~~If you dislike this sudden powercreep, you have the choice to move to JP. There's also a dedicated discord channel for JP players for those who are unaware.~~ Ultimately, its your choice. Play the game however you want. Don't let the opinions of others dictate your actions. But remember, GL is a different game. --- **A man has no name**, signing off.</TEXT>

This time, Golbez and Rubicante are renewed as 5 #9733; based units! The rest of the FFIV fiends remains untouched. [**Note**](/tg): This **does not mean** that the pre-existing Golbez and Rubicante that you own will be upgraded. You have to pull for the new ones! Barbariccia is a 4 #9733; unit in JP while she's a 5 #9733; in GL. So there's a small chance that we won't be getting Rubicante as a 5 #9733; unit. [Dark Mage Golbez](#I/Icons/u1309/) Dark Mage Golbez (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% MAG  amp; +20% Stats from Espers) [STMR](/#label-red): **Heavy Armor** (+45 DEF, +100 MAG  amp; +50% Dark Resist) **Summary**: I think Golbez will be highly sought after by a lot of players here. Not just because of his badass sprite design but also of how epic he is in terms of both nostalgia and gameplay. DM Golbez #8217;s LB imperils 100% dark while filling up the esper gauge at the same time! And yes, his LB summons a black dragon. For a detailed breakdown on his kit, check out this [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8wq8rd/7_full_review_golbez/). --- [Rubicante](#I/Icons/u1312/) Rubicante (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+20 MAG, +30% MAG/SPR  amp; +20% Fire/Ice Resists) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+80% MAG w/ Robe  amp; +30% Fire Resist) **Summary**: Rubicante, one of the four fiends specializes in fire magic (obviously). He mainly chains with a dupe and can imperil 100% fire. He has high mods on his abilities but most importantly, he no longer heals the enemy! You can see him BBQ-ing Malboro [here](https://youtu.be/qWBeR7RLoPo?t=737). --- FFIV features **2 banners**  #8211; one 25k step-up with guaranteed Rubicante or DM Golbez on the last step and another 11k step up with guaranteed PS Rydia, AD Kain or DKC. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8v29tw/jp_final_fantasy_iv_four_fiends_pickup_thread_71/ --- #Banner 2  #8211; Akstar Story Event Gumi at first attempted to smoothen out the powercreep by swapping Akstar with Crimson but later broke the entire power grid with Esther. Let us hope that our one-handed saviour will receive some GLEX upgrades when he arrives! [CG Akstar](#I/Icons/u1324/) Akstar (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIzdTzaUz3A/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+40 ATK, +50% LB Fill Rate +25% Accuracy +50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Katana** (+180 ATK, +50% Accuracy, 1.05x~1.55x Dmg Var) **Summary**: Akstar predominantly uses AT chaining skills while having access to DR and AR chains too. He is able to imbue himself with either fire/ice and has to build up stacks on his AT skill which can be further amplified by his LB resulting in an eventual 90x mod burst with T-cast. This is [his optimal rotation](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/akstarrotation): * T1: CD (120 MP) + Imperil (72MP) * T2: Imbue (42MP) + Recover HP/MP (56MP) + 48MP * T3: Stack [1] + Stack [2] + Stack [3] (62MP) * T4: LB * T5: CD (90 MP) + Stack [4] + Stack [4] (62MP) * T6: Stack [4] + Stack [4] + Stack [4] (62MP) Because of how his damage is heavily reliant on building up and maintaining stacks, it is [**absolutely critical**](/tg) that he doesn #8217;t die else you #8217;ll have to ramp up his damage all over again. --- [Gravie](#I/Icons/u1327/) Gravie **TMR**: **Materia** (+50% ATK with Katana  amp; +20% ATK w/ Clothes) **Summary**: His TMR is an essential pickup if you #8217;re going in for Akstar. 70% ATK boost is massive. Plus, this will also be great on TDW units in the future. --- [Tomoe](#I/Icons/u1330/) Tomoe **TMR**: **2h Gun** (+130 ATK, +70% Accuracy, 1.3x~1.7x Dmg Var) **Summary**: If you #8217;re planning for Regina, this is good gun to pick up if you #8217;ve missed out on Linebacker G-87 MSGL from Deus EX Event or don #8217;t have any guns in your arsenal like Machine Gun+ , Sparky etc. This is an obvious pass if you #8217;ve already gotten NG Jake #8217;s STMR or Vincent #8217;s STMR. --- [Majora](#I/Icons/u1333/) Majora **TMR**: **Accessory** (+3 DEF/SPR, +20% HP/MP  amp; 5% Auto-Refresh) **Summary**: Nice accessory for support units with decent HP/MP and auto-refresh. --- Akstar is a 25k lapis step up banner with a guaranteed chance of getting him on the last step. Banner info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8xmsb4/jp_story_event_23_banners_megathread_710720/) For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Akstar Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information- [Excerpt from JP megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8xmsb0/jp_story_event_23_event_megathread_710720/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app): * 1st Wave: **Chimera Brain**(Beast). Can be paralyzed. Fully Breakable. It uses attacks with paralyzing effects so plan accordingly. * 2nd Wave: **Amalthea**(Machine). DEF/SPR breakable. Uses mainly physical attacks so a dodge tank will help. * 3rd Wave: **Evil Drake**(Dragon). Fully breakable. Can be poisoned. Uses ST death so bring along safety bit/genji shield/genji armor. ------ #Banner 3  #8211; Summer Fina/Lid (Fid) Fid is one of the first summer units that we #8217;ll be getting and they have already found their way into the game #8217;s unit database as some have pointed out. [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) Summer Fina/Lid (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCPdnzynCTw/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+50 MP +3 DEF +3 SPR, +30% MP, +30% SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% DEF/SPR  amp; +60% Thunder/Water/Light Resist) **Summary**: Fid is one of the **best units** ever. They imbue, imperil, reraise and heal! It #8217;s a multi-role duo units unit! They have on-demand W-cast and can double cast their breaks which have an original 60% value but can be boosted to a 74% value after using their CD skill. They also come with substantial HP/MP regen for everyone. To add on, they provide a chaining ability for the entire team! So if you don #8217;t have Pod153 TMR, you need not worry. The chaining ability belongs to the AR family and is locked to water. And to top it off, they can **AoE Reraise**. Imo, Fid is a definite UoC candidate. -- Summer Fina/Lid was made available via a [8,000 Lapis bundle](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9650dc/jp_story_event_24_banners_megathread_810820/) in JP. Take note that we may not be able to obtain her in the same way in GL. --- #Banner 4  #8211; FFBE Orders An overdue that was supposed to drop during Cid's banner. It was probably delayed due to the Easter event. Expect it to drop pretty soon^TM. [Nagi](#I/Icons/u1297/) Nagi (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+35 ATK/MAG, +10 DEF, +12 SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+20% ATK, +50% MAG, 60% TDW) **Summary**: Nagi chains with the AR, DR and Graviton Cannon (GC) families. She comes with innate DW and her attacks are all hybrid based. While her STMR provides an incredible TDW boost, it isn #8217;t worth chasing because down the road, CG Lightning will oust her completely with her 100% TDW TMR. --- [Yego](#I/Icons/u1300/) Yego (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+20% MP, +40% ATK w/ Whip, +25% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Whip** (+176 ATK +50% Acc, Damage Variance: 1.05x~1.55x) **Summary**: Yego is probably the one and only hardcore whip user. She comes with on-demand W-ability and chains with the Pile Driver family. Remember [Shinju](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Shinju)? Her TMR will benefit Yego greatly. Other than that, she is hardly if not ever used in JP #8230; --- [Zolulu  amp; Delulu](#I/Icons/u1303/) Zolulu  amp; Delulu **TMR**: **Materia** (+20% ATK, +40% SPR w/ Instrument, +30% ATK w/ Bow) **Summary**: A bard unit with a 70% SPR debuff LB. --- [Galas](#I/Icons/u1306/) Galas **TMR**: **2h Greatsword** (+130 ATK, +10% DEF, +50% Acc, Damage Variance: 1x~1.6x) **Summary**: TMR is literally Revolving Saw v2 with an extra 10% DEF. --- Raid banner is on a 15,000 Lapis lap (max: 1) with a guaranteed Nagi or Yego on the last step.

A place where we have to **work hard** for time-limited rainbows! We received XG I and /u/TomAto314 has finally opened his coffers for Elly! This leaves XG II with Citan and Maria as remaining pickups! Will they pop this month? Hopefully. But if they do, will Akstar be pushed back again...? We've seen how the Easter units caused such uproar in the community, enough to even appear in [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-esther-sylvie-ffbe-patch-datamine-1401404)! The audacity of it all! What will happen this month!? Will Parasite Eve finally arrive? Will content creators/contributors ask for more nerfs for units to maintain the game's balance? Will we get compensation? Is the GL finally breaking away from the molds JP and becoming its own version of the game? Will SoM ever see the light of day!? Stay tuned on the next GumiWar Z..! --- ###Xenogears II Part I of Xenogears has been confirmed at last! We are now left with Part II. These are the units: [Citan](#I/Icons/u1261/) Citan (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK with Fist/ Katana  amp; 50% TDH) [STMR](/#label-red): **Katana** (+176 ATK, +20% ATK  amp; +75% Phys/Mag Damage vs Humans) **Summary**: Water elemental AT chainer. Has on-demand W-cast and unlockable T-cast. Citan also rocks a solid innate 150% TDH and is an [extremely powerful chainer to date.](https://youtu.be/ummtbDr4Juo?t=317) There #8217;s a solid breakdown of his kit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8l8i4d/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_citan/) --- [Maria](#I/Icons/u1264/) Maria (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+30 DEF, +52 MAG  amp; +40% Light Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG with Rod, +30% MP/MAG  amp; 5 LB/Turn) **Summary**: The ultimate [fister](https://youtu.be/yFL5rskgjQg?t=583). Her LB makes [regular Aigaion her bitch](https://youtu.be/qsTvBOu2zF4?t=19). Not sure about Aigaion Kai though... --- [Billy](#I/Icons/u1267/) Billy **TMR**: **Gun** (+130 ATK, +20 SPR) **Summary**: LB provides +80% Fire/Water/Wind/Earth Resistance and comes with innate DW. He also imperils earth by 60% in his chaining skill. --- Part II of Xenogears has a 15k lapis step-up banner: * Step 1: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; Guaranteed Billy * Step 2: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1.5x 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Rates * Step 3: 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Ticket  amp; 1x Guaranteed Random 1x Fei/Elly/Bart/Citan/Maria Unit More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/8kz4t0/jp_521531_banners_xenogears_collab_2_pickup_thread/) --- ###Octopath Traveler Octopath Traveler is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released worldwide on July 13, 2018 and was collaborated with FFBE JP almost simultaneously. These are the units: [Primrose](#I/Icons/u1336/) Primrose (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+16 DEF, +40 SPR, +40% SPR, +100% Petrify Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG, +60% SPR  amp; 80% Chance Ignore up to 1 Fatal Attacks when HP above 40%) **Summary**: Primrose is like Soleil v10. She #8217;s is an insane buffer with 200% stat boosts in her LB along with AoE HP/MP heals over time and AoE LB fill. She comes with on-demand W-cast for her dances. Her regular dance moves provide 130% stat boosts and her CD ability comes with 40% damage mitigation that unlocks 160% stat boosts. She can even provide charm protection as a bonus. Her kit also includes killer boosts for Beasts/Dragons/Plants/Spirits, dark imbue (which can be W-cast) and dark imperil. The only thing she really lacks is an assortment of elemental resistance buffs. Other than that, she is a solid buffer for any team. --- [Olberic](#I/Icons/u1339/) Olberic (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% HP, +20% DEF, +100% Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Light Armor** (+1000 HP, +62 DEF, +55 SPR, +20% ATK/DEF) **Summary**: Olberic is a physical tank with innate provoke and 50% draw. His LB has a 40% damage mitigation. His CD unlocks a better cover ability with up to 80% damage reduction. As a plus, he can chain with the AR family which AoE debuffs by 80% wind/earth and he is capable of ST breaking for 60% value. His STMR has an insane 1,000 HP with decent DEF/SPR stats and a 20% DEF boost. Considering how we didn #8217;t get Gabranth whose STMR is a helmet with +1000 HP +18 ATK +81 DEF and +20% HP, this can be considered a great addition for anyone building up the ultimate beefy tank. --- [Therion](#I/Icons/u1342/) Therion **TMR**: **Accessory** (+12 ATK, +26 DEF, +30% Camouflage, +20% Physical Evade) **Summary**: TMR is excellent for dodge builds if you didn #8217;t farm Twenty-sided Die or don #8217;t have Ring of Lucii. --- [Tressa](#I/Icons/u1345/) Tressa **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% ATK/MAG, +25% EXP gained from battles) **Summary**: A good addition to EXP items for levelling units. --- Octopath Traveler had a ticket campaign where players would receive 1 Primrose/Olberic Ticket for every 10+1 summon done and can exchange for a Primrose/Olberic of choice with 5 ticket pieces. There was also a [**one-time**](/tg) 5,000 Lapis with a **guaranteed either Primrose/Olberic**. You don #8217;t get any Primrose/Olberic tickets for this one though. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/90e4j8/jp_banner_octopath_traveler_collab_720_731/). --- #TomAto #8217;s Longshot Collab!

    <TEXT>[Vol 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ayjm7y/resource_planning_the_importance_of_world_mission/?utm_source=share amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) Following my previous post on the importance of WMR, I would like to re-iterate just how crucial it is and why. Apart from the congregation of all the nice units that are coming soon^TM ,we have yet another wall looming ahead of us. What exactly is this wall that I speak of? I refer you to [CG Dark Fina's banner](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/apqwgi/jp_summon_festival_vday_banners_megathread_212228/?utm_source=share amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app). Just like how Dark Fina getting re-sealed in a crystal marks a crucial point in the story, CG Dark Fina also highlights a turning point at how certain units are obtainable in the game - behind a wall of lapis. --- ###Current list of non-UoCable Banners: * [CG Dark Fina](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/apqwgi/jp_summon_festival_vday_banners_megathread_212228/?utm_source=share amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) * [CG AK Rain](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/azqbpl/jp_summon_festival_2_banners_megathread_311320/) * [CG Onion Knight](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b7p2wz/jp_ffiii_cg_ok_fest_banners_megathread_41414/) * [CG HK Lasswell](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bbj2tz/jp_summon_festival_4_lasswell_banners_megathread/) --- As you can see, starting with her banner onwards, certain CG units are **non-UoCable** and are classified as "Summon Festival" units. They can only be obtained by using lapis on their respective step-up banners and through the special tickets obtained by doing the step-ups. Yes... WTF indeed. However, if you miss them due to the lack of resources, they'll make a return in the future - just like how CG AK Rain will be featured as a split banner together with CG Prince Noctis as part of the new chair meta. Also, for summer fest banners, you get to pull from a reduced rainbow pool which means higher chances of getting the units you want. This is JP's latest business model - to coerce players into pulling for the latest remade units with **predominantly lapis** (you can still use the usual tickets, 4 #9733; tickets, 500 and 5000 Lapis pulls) and making them unavailable through UoC. **Worse, some banners are split...** Now last time, we, on the GL side would bitch about how generous JP is with their bundles and banners. But not anymore. We should be wary of this incoming change that Gumi is most likely to adopt; seeing how monetarily driven they are. --- ###What does this mean? [**Lapis becomes more important than UoC in the near future**.](/tg) Apart from the occassional threads asking for Fountain of Lapis to be made a monthly subscription, we also need a dedicated one for WMR- to cater not just for the F2Pers but also the P2Pers. This is also why we tell alot of players to use their UoCs for support units, and not damage dealers. DDs keep the game alive by raking in lapis while support units help us clear trials --- ###When should I start saving? I would say post Easter banner is a great time to start saving up lapis if you have eyes on the summon festival units above. It takes about 2 months+ to accumulate 25k lapis and CG Dark Fina would likely be here in November (assuming no sudden shuffling), leaving us with ~7 months to restock our coffers. Things will be alot easier with WMR...!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>War of the Visions - Interview with Hirono/Hiroki by DualShockers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-04 20:12:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I went to dig up a little to see what news we have on [War of the Visions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znKIhbl0yTM) that's supposedly due this year. I'm not sure if this has already been posted but if so, feel free to remove as needed. Articles were written recently in April last month by DualShockers. --- [Interview with Hirono and Hiroki](https://www.dualshockers.com/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-interview-collaborations-art/)  gt; As Square prepares for another year of content and the launch of a tactics spin off called **War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius**, we had the chance to speak with producers Kei Hirono and Hiroki Fujimoto to discuss War of the Visions, setting up crossover events, and where the game is going. [**Vanessa Brangi**](/#label-blue) : What are the biggest ideas in Final Fantasy Brave Exvius that came from Square Enix #8217;s work on previous handheld Final Fantasy RPGs? [**Kei Hirono**](/#label-red) : The biggest idea that lies behind Final Fantasy Brave Exvius is creating a novel game experience that marries these two elements: the pixel art that has adorned the early titles of the Final Fantasy series, and the CG art featured in newer titles in the series. [**VB**](/#label-blue): How closely tied is the current Final Fantasy Brave Exvius team with the one creating War of the Visions? Will players be able to transfer any data between the games? [**KH**](/#label-red): The teams are completely separate from each other, but there #8217;s good communication between the two as they exchange information and share assets. Things like this are relayed back and forth through key members like me. In regards to transferring data, I can #8217;t answer at this point in time. [**VB**](/#label-blue): Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has been home to many crossovers. What are the biggest challenges the team runs into when planning one of these crossovers? [**Hiroki Fujimoto**](/#label-yellow): In Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, whenever we participate in a collaboration, it #8217;s important to us to ensure that both sides are able to benefit from it. We incorporate compelling characters and worlds from the other collaborator into Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, thereby heightening the value of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and having our players enjoy these elements as they appear in the game. Simultaneously, we want to help spread the word about, or contribute to heightening the value of, the collaborating title through various elements such as the Final Fantasy Brave Exvius world, the scope of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius as a platform through which to share information, and awareness, to name a few. As such, it can be a bit of a challenge to adjust the timing and content of the collaborations to benefit both parties involved. [**VB**](/#label-blue): This game has surprisingly collaborated with pop singers like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry. Why did the development team decide to put celebrities in the game? How do these crossover events perform when compared to ones with other games? [**KH**](/#label-red): The biggest reason we had for collaborating with these celebrities was that we wanted as many people as possible to play Final Fantasy Brave Exvius. We thought the best way for the game to be seen by people throughout the world, without the boundaries of video games, countries, or age, was to work with a celebrity. After all, by limiting our collaborations to those held with just other games, we would end up revolving around people who are gaming fans already. As a result of our collaborations with these singers, many non-gaming fans started playing the game as well. [**VB**](/#label-blue): Many people would like to get into Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, but are intimidated by the Gatcha system. Has the team ever considered a subscription based model for the game that doesn #8217;t conflict with the Gatcha framework? [**HF**](/#label-yellow): A subscription-based system is something that is under consideration, but there are no concrete plans for it at this time. **There #8217;s no need to be intimidated by the Gatcha system** (we refer to it as a  #8220;Summon #8221; system in the game). As you move through the game, you #8217;ll be able to obtain Lapis, which is the material necessary to perform Summons. On top of that, there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy Summons for free, such as through login bonuses and limited time events. **It #8217;s not made in a way that requires players to pay money in order to have fun, so please don #8217;t fret about this as you play.** [**VB**](/#label-blue): What are the biggest differences do you see in players #8217; tastes and approaches toward the game between regions like Japan and North America? [**HF**](/#label-yellow): The biggest difference is play time. Compared to Japanese players, North American players spend more time out of each day playing the game. For this reason, **we hold in-game events four times per month in the Global version**, while we hold them three times per month in the Japanese version. **We provide more content than in the Japanese version in the hopes of keeping Global players engaged longer.** [**VB**](/#label-blue): The Japanese version of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius will turn 4 later this year. How has the development team adapted to make sure the game stays relevant and how much longer do you plan on supporting the game for? [**HF**](/#label-yellow): The Japanese version turns four this October, while the Global version turns three this June. These past four years have felt long at times, but at the same time they #8217;ve really flown by. The fact that we #8217;ve been able to keep on with this game thus far is thanks to all of the players who play this game. I #8217;m truly grateful. We receive many comments, and there are a great many points that we haven #8217;t been able to reflect, but **I hope that the players will continue to support the game, and that they #8217;ll enable Final Fantasy Brave Exvius to continue pushing content out in the five, ten, and thirty years to come. We are developing content with the serious ambition of supporting this game for the next thirty years**. [**VB**](/#label-blue): Is there anything else you would like to share with DualShockers #8217; readers today? [**HF**](/#label-yellow): Popular characters we know and love from the Final Fantasy series will continue to appear in the game. Additionally, we also have plans for some highly popular original Final Fantasy Brave Exvius characters to appear as units. I hope you #8217;ll look forward to them. --- [War of the Visions Asset Sharing](https://www.dualshockers.com/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-asset-sharing/)  gt; Square Enix and gumi inc. first unveiled War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius for iOS and Android back in December 2018. That being said, the title is still shrouded in a lot of mystery as we only really know that it will be a tactics game that takes place on the continent of Ardra where five nations are at war. Even though Square Enix is still being secretive about the game, DualShockers did learn in a recent interview with some of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius #8217; Producers that the **developers of that game are sharing assets with the War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius development team in order to assist with its creation**.  gt; While Final Fantasy Brave Exvius Producer **Kei Hirono** was coy about saying too much regarding War of the Visions during his email interview with DualShockers, he **did touch on how the two development teams are collaborating through  #8220;key members #8221; such as himself**.  #8220;There #8217;s good communication between the two as they exchange information and share assets. Things like this are relayed back and forth through key members like me, #8221; he told DualShockers.  gt; That being said, Hirono-san was reiterated that  #8220;the teams are completely separate from each other #8221; when it comes to the actual work on both Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and the upcoming War of the Visions. DualShockers also asked if War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius will allow players to transfer any data over from Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, but Hirono-san simply said it was something he  #8220;can #8217;t answer at this point in time. #8221; ---</TEXT>

    <TITLE>War of the Visions - Ardra</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-06 19:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yup, another WotV thread! I can't help but feel excited for this spinoff. I've never played FFT so this should be something new for me. And we know that WotV draws inspiration from FFT: War of the Lions and is expected to share similar gameplay while implementing the gacha system. Now to Ardra and who to expect: Ardra is a continent in the world of Lapis and is depicted in the game's original world map but is currently obscured by clouds and is inaccessible. It's supposedly on the south eastern side of Lapis world map, north of the Realm of Dragon King and south of Grandshelt. It is also home to the magic swordsmen who have mastered both magic and the sword aka Hybrid Units or units with the job tagged as "Spellblade". Ardra is also grounds of battle between Five different nations. Who to expect from Ardra? Currently, there are a few units (with a possible remake) in mind: * [Bedile](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Bedile) * [Rakshasa](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Rakshasa) * [Ronaldo](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Ronaldo) * [Silvia](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Silvia) #Bedile[Bedile](#I/Icons/u109/)  gt; A warrior from a small tribe that existed long ago that was proficient in both sword and sorcery. Bedile was a stoic man who shared a vow of silence with his comrades regarding the ways of the mystic sword. As fate would have it, he later fell in love with a foreign woman he had saved and was banished from his home. His once-proud tribe now but a memory, only the legend of Bedile protecting his love until the end remains.  gt; A warrior who mastered sorcery and the sword. Bedile broke the vow of silence that granted him heightened spiritual powers, and was banished from his home after breaking his tribe's law against mingling with outsiders. He eventually took his foreign love as his wife, and protected the family they had built together till the end of his days. #Rakshasa[Rakshasa](#I/Icons/u214/)  gt; An enigmatic young lady adept with both sorcery and the sword. Rakshasa fought from the shadows in the service of numerous nations, though her own origins remained a mystery, as she never spoke of herself. Nonetheless, her formidable powers earned her the respect and feat of both allies and enemies until the day she mysteriously vanished without a trace. #Ronaldo[Ronaldo](#I/Icons/u057/)  gt; A warrior who mastered both magic and the sword. Ronaldo's people were very secretive about their practices to enhance their magical powers, which led them to take a vow of silence long ago. Unfortunately, their insistence on keeping the secrets of their spellblades by eschewing all contact with their neighbors eventually led to the nation's ruin, its name lost to history forever.  gt; A warrior who excelled in both magic and swordsmanship. Ronaldo's small nation strictly prohibited contact with others, which allowed him to focus solely on heightening the spiritual power required to master these dual arts. Though he dedicated his life to protecting his people, the strong curiosity he secretly felt for the outside world has brought him back as a vision. #Silvia[Sylvia](#I/Icons/u656/)  gt; A girl who after studying to become a knight of Grandshelt, went on to become a spellblade in Mysidia. She was one to chase after her dreams, and a large part of the reason she decided to become a magic swordswoman was from her admiration for Rakshasa who she read about in stories when she was young. Her dream now is to somehow get to Ardra, home of the magic swordsmen. --- **My Thoughts** We know that Ardra is a continent that is plagued by war between **FIVE** rival nations. Looking at both Bedile and Ronaldo's lore, they belonged in the same nation due to the vow of silence they shared. But Bedile fell in love with a foreign woman, most possibly Rakshasa, after saving her from a battle and they eventually ended up together and built a life for themselves possibly in some deserted and peaceful hidden area within Ardra. This adds up with her lore that she mysteriously disappeared one day without a trace after all her great feats. On the other side, Silvia may eventually get to travel to Ardra to find out more about Rakshasa and the continent of Ardra. She would then master new techniques and amplify her current abilities. It'll definitely be interesting to see Bedile and Rakshasa in their prime as 5 #9733; units. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: Remember not to take Zeno's preliminary skill set/data values as concrete information tonight</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-08 20:15:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know alot of us, myself included. are very excited and hyped about this new GLEX unit that's a few days away. Remember that painful lesson we've learnt ~2 weeks ago. Let us not make the same mistake again. When the data info comes up on the wiki tonight (which it will), **keep in mind that is is still subject to changes**. We can only ascertain Zeno's true potential and kit once his banner goes live on Friday. During this interim, it is best to lower your expectations to avoid certain disappointment. PS: [**Wait for Zeno's finalized skill/data values**](/tg) before pulling. There's no rush - his banner will be here a while and isn't going anywhere.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mini SYP - Zeno</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-09 19:38:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**Disclaimer**](/tg): The SYP is written at this current point in time based on the present data we have on Zeno. May be invalidated if there are last minute patches. First off, I wanna apologize for my incessant butthurt nerf/buff thread yesterday regarding Zeno's skillset. I have a tendency to be too carried away with my own thoughts at times and yesterday was probably one of the worse instances. I'll be better the next time. You have my word. Moving on, Zeno is a GLEX unit that is featured alongside Akstar in a step-up banner. He's our first real TDW unit and has a varying degree of versatility depending depending on where you need him. --- **Pros** * 200% capped TDW * Benefits from new 6x chain bonus with Dual Wield Mastery * Able to equip various elemental weapons * Comes with self-imbue/imperil (100%) * Chains with 4 different families (DR, AR, BS, AT) * High Burst Damage **Cons** * Requires fixed cycling for optimal damage * No killers * No innate charm/stop immunity * Stacks reset upon death * No room for further improvement except through enhancements * Not wearing a bunny suit --- Zeno's main strength is his innate capped TDW% through unlocking Trust Ability. This gives him a ton of ATK and he can easily hit 2.5k-2.8k ATK range with little effort. However, this is also his critical flaw because it means that he's already hit the power ceiling and can only be improved further via future enhancements and possibly a S2 Series Boss Battle. This is really quite far into the future and by then, he'll be well powercrept by new ~~Summon Fest~~ units. Coming back to the present, Zeno introduces Dual Wield Mastery which basically allows certain TDW units to benefit from a higher chain cap bonus of 6x instead of the regular 4x. This is huge because it has a very significant impact on his burst turns. Zeno is also self-reliant - he is able to imbue himself with fire and imperil it for 100%. However, because fire is a relatively common element of resistance, he might not be able to always use it depending on what enemies you're facing. This takes me to his next strength - equipment versatility. Zeno is capable of wielding 2 weapons innately without the use of Genji gloves/Awesome Swordsman/Dual Wield. This gives him immense flexibility on his choices of weapons for battle. He can equip swords, greatswords, katanas and daggers. We have a good array of elements corresponding to these weapons eg. Hyomonto (Ice), Tonitrus (Thunder), Excalibur (Holy), Brotherhood (Water) etc. Depending on the battle, you can switch him up to suit the enemy's weakness easily without losing ATK in the process. This brings me to his chaining partners. Zeno chains with 4 different families - DR/AR/BS/AT. If you can't find a friend Zeno with the desired weapon setup, you can bring along your own unit like Sora, PG Laswell, Raegen, Sephiroth etc to the battle. And most of them come with their own imperil too eg. Raegen debuffs Ice, Lasswell imperils Wind/Ice, Sephiroth for Holy/Dark, Esther for Thunder. Don't forget we're getting Sephiroth's enhancements this month too! Based on the damage sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cPQPPjOVZ1dQqLHX6nICOtMmI1bnlDnei9kDU4xaww0/edit#gid=0), Zeno has a very high burst damage. However, you'll need to remember that he's a cycling damage dealer. He relies heavily on maintaining his rotations for optimal damage output. While this may be boosted by the 200% ATK self-buff **every turn** via Fired Up, should he die in the midst of ramping up his damage, you'll have to restart your rotations from scratch. This can really complicate things especially if you're at a critical threshold - say Asura sub 20% and you need to burst her down before things start falling apart. Using Esther as a comparison, Zeno lacks: * Tankiness. Esther's naturally tankier than him. Energizer bunnysuit even lets her absorb Thunder element! * Innate Stop/Charm Immunity - crucial ailments especially if we get Scorn of Echidna.... * Killers. Apart from his own STMR that adds 75% human killer, he doesn't have any innate killers in his kit. * Ease of usage. Esther's skillset is very beginner friendly - just spam LB on every other turn once its up. If she dies, she just needs to recharge her LB, apply self imbue + imperil and she's back in the game. --- [**Should You Pull?**](/gt) * If you have Esther, probably not. Your resources will see better use for other key role filling in your such as tanking or healing. A possible upcoming healer this month may be Aerith and there are other powerful supports down the road like Summer Fid/Lid and CG Charlotte. * If you're still rocking with Hyoh and other old school chainers, yes. **Keep in mind that Zeno shares his banner with Akstar though**. Nothing bad if you land either because they are still a solid upgrade. More of a preference issue actually. --- I hope you've found this useful. **AMHNN**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full Clear Video: https://youtu.be/D4MsPse7G30 **Equipment shown [here](https://youtu.be/D4MsPse7G30?t=476)** --- Unit | Role ---|---| [Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/) | Evade Cover/Provoke [2B](#I/Icons/u774/) | Breaker [CG Folka](#I/Icons/u1207/) | Ailment Resist/Violent Current Chainer [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/) | Esper Gauge Fill/Buffer/Flood Chainer [Kid Rydia](#I/Icons/u875/) | Esper Gauge Fill [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) | Finisher --- Link to /u/Sinzar_'s guide [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bmminl/tips_for_akstar_bonus_stage_bosses/) **Round 1** (3T): Chimera Brain 2B debuffed and used True Charge Blade to max out her LB for the mission, PS Rydia filled the esper gauge together with Nichol. Cid set up his nuke. Once done, Nichol x Folka chained and Cid landed. **Round 2** (3T): Amalthea 2B debuffed and was equipped with a lightning katana for the mission. Cid set up his nuke, Folka imperiled Amalthea for 75% water debuff and chained with Nichol's Flood while Cid capped the chain. Esper bar was filled by Nichol and Rydia before proceeding to the next round. **Final Round** (4T): Evil Drake 2B debuffed while I completed the 2 esper summon missions. Once done, again, Cid set up his nuke jump, Folka x Nichol chained for the finish. No deaths. Cid had Odin Esper and Syldra's Protection for added Dragon Killers. --- Honestly the difficulty of the bonus stages has dropped significantly ever since Folka's event. Not complaining though. On a slightly unrelated note, I did a full lap of the split step up banner and landed with 2 Akstars.. Looks like I'll have to UoC both Zenos then..</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Resource Planning: Support Units</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-11 00:03:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello and welcome to another Resource Planning thread! With Esther just introduced into the game just 2 weeks ago, she has already been powercrept by Zeno, a variant of Akstar that outcrept Akstar. From the looks of it, GL is trying to thwart us from hoarding for specific units based on JP's crystal ball/clairvoyance by throwing in GLEX units. Zeno's the **third consecutive GLEX** we've received in less than a month! I won't be surprised if they introduce Levnato of the Alpha Star or even the Aldore Emperor himself as playable units in the near future. They are slowly but surely moving away from JP's series of events and creating a ~~powercreep curve~~ timeline of their own. Players with Esther/Zeno are more than prepped for the next 5-6 upcoming trials until at least the next damage race in [Scorn of Elafikeras](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a1emof/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_elafikeras/) with exception of [Scorn of the Moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9u2s6a/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bloody_moon/) where physical DDs can't do shit but is made much easier with Summer Folka/Citra. This means your resources will see much better value pulling for support role units in your team. Afterall, they are the real ones who carry the fight. These are some of the **more popular** upcoming support units: Unit | Reddit Wiki | Role | ETA ---|---|---|---| [Aerith](#I/Icons/u1355/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1355) | Healer | May/June | [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1361) | Debuffer | June/July [Summer Folka  amp; Citra](#I/Icons/u1392/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1392) | Evoke Support | June/July [CG Charlotte](#I/Icons/u1422/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1422) | Magic Tank | July [King Edgar](#I/Icons/u1379/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1379) | Debuffer | July [Dawn Warrior Galuf](#I/Icons/u1478/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1478) | Physical Tank | September [Light Warrior Lenna](#I/Icons/u1484/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1484) | Healer | September [CG Warrior of Light](#I/Icons/u1550/) | [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1550) | Physical Tank | December --- #Quick Summaries [Aerith](#I/Icons/u1355/) **Aerith** * LB cures all ailments, AoE revives, Removes all ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR/Stop/Charm Debuffs and applies AoE reraise. * HP barriers, Stat Debuff Protection, 30% general damage mitigation * Stop/Charm removals * Various methods of healing/regen * W-cast for some of her abilities --- [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) **Summer Fina/Lid** * Strong Debuffer * AoE water imbue, AoE grant AR chaining skill, AoE water/ice imperil * AoE reraise and heals * W-cast for some of her abilities --- [Summer Folka  amp; Citra](#I/Icons/u1392/) **Summer Folka/Citra** * Strong Evoke Support * Water/Light Evoke damage scales with 100% SPR and chains with AT family * AoE grant AR chaining skill * On-demand Stat debuff/Ailment protection, Light/Water Resistance * W-cast for her abilities --- [CG Charlotte](#I/Icons/u1422/) **CG Charlotte** * LB provides 50% general damage mitigation * Innate 50% Draw and Guts * Provoke, Magic Cover ability * On-demand AoE 30% magic damage mitigation and defensive buffs --- [King Edgar](#I/Icons/u1379/) **King Edgar** * LB provides 84% decaying full break * Innate Dual Wield/ Charm Resist * 100% Water/Earth Imperil * Chains with SR/FB Family * Multiple Self-LB fill rate abilities * W-cast for his abilities --- [Dawn Warrior Galuf](#I/Icons/u1478/) **Dawn Warrior Galuf** * LB provides 50% general damage mitigation * Innate 80% Draw, Guts and Charm Resist * W-cast unlocked via ability * 90% Light/Fire imperil * Chains with Kingsglaive Family * Provoke, Physical Cover ability * 4T Physical Cover as CD * 40% general damage mitigation from CD --- [Light Warrior Lenna](#I/Icons/u1484/) **Light Warrior Lenna** * LB removes ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR Debuffs and applies AoE reraise * Entrust * On-demand AoE 30% general damage mitigation * Stop/Charm Debuff * On-demand Stat debuff/Ailment (including Charm/Stop) protection * T-cast for white magic * W-cast for her abilities --- [CG Warrior of Light](#I/Icons/u1550/) **CG Warrior of Light** * LB provides HP barrier and 250% DEF buff * Innate 80% Draw and Guts * Provoke, Physical Cover ability * Chains with DR/SR Family * 4T Physical Cover as CD * 50% general damage mitigation as CD --- As trials become harder, you'll find that damage mitigation, stat debuff/ ailment protection become increasingly important when certain attacks become uncoverable and more bosses imperil ailments. You'll definitely need to be better prepared in order to survive trials. Refrain from chasing the damage dealers (unless you are dead sure that your supports can carry you through trials with low to no effort) because powercreep is a never-ending cycle and is a main feature that keeps the game alive. Most of us have probably bled our resources dry for the Easter banner and the current Akstar/Zeno banner for damage dealers. Now's a good time to start recuperating your tickets and lapis to prep for upcoming banners that might feature critical support units for you. --- **Relevant Links** * [Monthly Outlook](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bfgzpz/gl_monthly_outlook_may/) * [Upcoming Banner Compilation](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bj924w/gl_upcoming_banners_compilation_list/) --- **AMHNN**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Summon Festival Units - What was happening 6 months prior and changes to KM Events.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-13 05:17:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>The general understanding is that for CG animated units, it takes about 6 months of planning before the unit is released. So I was curious about the latest Summon Festival Banners that caused quite the uproar - along with multiple prominent JP players to quit. I decided to look back in the past to see what was happening back then in JP when Alim had this insane monetary oriented business model. I also threw in GL's banners just for comparison purposes. |Month|CG Unit|6-months Ago|JP's Past Banners|GL's Past Banners| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |May|[CG Noctis](#I/Icons/u1604/)[Lunafreya](#I/Icons/u1610/)[Madam Edel](#I/Icons/u1619/)|Nov|[CG Lightning](#I/Icons/u1445/)[Future Hope](#I/Icons/u1448/)[Lilikin Yuna](#I/Icons/u1454/)[Lilikin Squall](#I/Icons/u1457/)[Sol](#I/Icons/u1460/)[Light Warrior Krile](#I/Icons/u1472/)[Dark Mage Exdeath](#I/Icons/u1475/)[Dawn Warrior Galuf](#I/Icons/u1478/)|[Kurasame](#I/Icons/u1162/)[Machina](#I/Icons/u1159/[Elephim](#I/Icons/u1137/)[Beryl](#I/Icons/u8196/)[Ellesperis](#I/Icons/u8193/)| |Apr|[CG King Lasswell](#I/Icons/u1586/)|Oct|[CG Charlotte](#I/Icons/u1422/)[Kimono Ayaka](#I/Icons/u1434/)[Dress up Eileen](#I/Icons/u1437/)|[Ignis](#I/Icons/u1052/)[CG Citra](#I/Icons/u1086/)[Lilith](#I/Icons/u8199/)[Lucius](#I/Icons/u8202/)[Lenneth](#I/Icons/u1095/)[Freya](#I/Icons/u1098/)[Arngrim](#I/Icons/u1101/)| |-|[CG Onion Knight](#I/Icons/u1577/)|-|-|| |March|[CG Aldore King Rain](#I/Icons/u1559/)|Sep|[King Edgar](#I/Icons/u1379/)[Fighter Sabin](#I/Icons/u1382/)[Summer Folka  amp; Citra](#I/Icons/u1392/)[Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/)|[Estark](#I/Icons/u1002/)[Marquis de leon](#I/Icons/u1005/)[Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)[Aloha Lasswell](#I/Icons/u8172/)[Seaside Nichol](#I/Icons/u8175/)[Malphasie](#I/Icons/u8184/)[Circe](#I/Icons/u8187/)| |Feb|[CG Dark Fina](#I/Icons/u1541/)|Aug|[Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/)[Crimson](#I/Icons/u1364/)[Aerith](#I/Icons/u1355/)[Red XIII](#I/Icons/u1358/)[Zack](#I/Icons/u1373/)[Yuffie](#I/Icons/u1376/)|[Squall](#I/Icons/u956/)[Rinoa](#I/Icons/u959/)[Nal](#I/Icons/u989/)[Adam Jensen](#I/Icons/u8166/)[Viktor](#I/Icons/u8169/)[Livid Shantotto](#I/Icons/u1017/) [Shadowlord](#I/Icons/u1020/)| From the looks of it, when the 4 FFVII units were dropped, Alim **already** had this idea - create CG Dark Fina BUT make her non-UoCable thus beginning the entire series of the Summon Festival to snowball. This month alone, they released **THREE CONSECUTIVE** S.Fest Units - CG Noctis, Lunafreya and Madam Edel... And coincidentally, we, on GL's side also received 3 consecutive GLEX units - Sylvie, Esther and Zeno with pretty absurd power creep just within 2 weeks... **Unit of Choice** Tickets were also decreased from 3 to 1. The last KM event that had the usual 3 UoCs in JP was during [CG Firion/DK Leon's KM event](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/alq7gm/jp_ffii_mk_7_cg_firion_dk_leon_banners_megathread/). Thereafter, starting with [CG Warrior of Light's KM Event](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aw26pq/jp_ff1_mk_series_event_event_thread_31_314/) you have to accumulate Event Points (EP) to get rewards, similar to Raid events. Note that these EP **is not affected by the featured unit's bonus %**. This means a very steep grind is required to get all of them. The usual event currency can still be derived but is used to exchange for different set of rewards. This is the list of rewards obtainable from the EP during CG WoL's KM Event: |Event Points|Rewards| :--|:--| |300pt|3x Minituar| |700pt|5x Summon Tickets| |1,200pt|5x Gil Snappers| |1,800pt|[Accessory] (FFI)+20 ATK, +6 DEF  amp; Auto 60% ATK Buff (Inf)| |2,500pt|5x Summon Tickets| |3,200pt|10x Gil Snappers| |4,000pt|Event Currency: 10000| |5,000pt|1x 4 #9733; Summon Ticket| |6,000pt|8x Minituar| |7,000pt|[Heavy Shield] (FFI)+48 DEF/SPR, 30% Dark Resist  amp; Poison/Petrify Resist| |8,000pt|10x Minituar| |9,000pt|15x Gil Snappers| |10,000pt|Event Currency: 10000| |12,500pt|2x Minituar| |15,000pt|(Special 5 #9733; Limited Ticket)| |17,500pt|3x Minituar| |20,000pt|Event Currency: 20000| |25,000pt|5x Minituar| |30,000pt|Event Currency: 20000| |35,000pt|King Gil Snapper| |40,000pt|Event Currency: 30000| |45,000pt|King Gil Snapper| |50,000pt|**(1/10) UoC Ticket**| |60,000pt|King Gil Snapper| |70,000pt|Event Currency: 30000| |80,000pt|King Gil Snapper| |90,000pt|Event Currency: 30000| |100,000pt|(Special 5 #9733; Limited Ticket)| Any KM event after CG WoL will follow this new system- CG OK, CG Noctis etc where you only get 1 UoC. To get your desired Summon Fest Units, you either have to use lapis or regular tickets. At this point, I cannot say confidently that GL will not follow JP even though they are throwing really nice GLEX units our way. This does not mean that the S.Fest business model would not be used when the time comes. With this information in mind, I think you can begin to piece together what caused the Golden Week of Quitting.</TEXT>

It provides information for the banners in JP to help you prep in advance for the units that you are looking to pull. I #8217;ve sorted them accordingly based on Story Event Units, KM Units, Raid Units and Summon Festival Units. I #8217;m currently maintaining this thread as new banners roll out. --- #Banner 1  #8211; FFVII (1) FFVII series is so popular that we #8217;ve almost got the entire cast by now! FFVII is split into 2 parts  #8211; a KM and a Raid event. Aerith/Red XIII comes with a KM Event which is most likely happening this Friday on 05/24. [Aerith](#I/Icons/u1355/) Aerith (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+50% SPR  amp; Gain 2 LS per Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **Accessory** (+60 SPR, +60% SPR, +50% Dark Resist  amp; 5% MP/Turn, Increases damage modifier for certain skills) **Summary**: Aerith is an upgraded version of Ayaka/Fina. She cures stop through several abilities while having the standard white mage kit. Her LB is like hitting the reset and save button together  #8211; it raises the fallen and applies a re-raise to them! It also cures all breaks/ailments and removes charm/stop debuffs. She is able to imperil 100% light element, allowing you to fit in units like Aurora Fryevia or a certain light-based back-stabbing damage dealer nicely. Unlike Folka, she doesn #8217;t cover all ailment resist, which makes it a little problematic for future trials that break your resistance against ailments. Other than that, she #8217;s a solid healer with on-demand W-cast for most of her abilities and would last well until LW Lenna for anyone that desperately needs one in their team now. [**Bonus**](/tg): [Stingy Should You Pull- Aerith](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bq5pam/stingy_should_you_pull_aerith/) --- [Red XIII](#I/Icons/u1358/) Red XIII (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+50 ATK, +10% ATK/+20% MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Accessory** (+60 ATK, +30% MP  amp; +100% LB Fill Rate) **Summary**: Red XIII is the origin of the Stardust Ray chain family in JP. He is capable of imbuing himself with fire/wind/dark and imperils them with his LB. He comes with on-demand W-cast and can unlock T-cast through his LB and CD abilities. He also has innate bonus beast/demon/undead killer+ from both his passive and Trust Ability, making him exceptionally strong against those type of enemies. --- This FFVII banner is on a 25k lapis banner at max of 3 laps with a guaranteed Aerith/Red XIII on the last step. More info found [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/93f4q7/jp_final_fantasy_7_4_pickup_thread_81_814/) Don #8217;t forget that **Barret** and **Cait Sith** are recurring bonus units during this King Mog Event! --- #Banner 2  #8211; FFVII (2) This is the second part of the FFVII banner through a raid event featuring Zack and Yuffie. This banner may drop in the following week after Aerith/RedXIII #8217;s banner. [Zack](#I/Icons/u1373/) Zack (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **2h Greatsword** (+145 ATK, +50% Accuracy, Variance: 1x~1.6x) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+40% ATK w/ Greatsword, +25% Accuracy, +100% TDH) **Summary**: Zack, another iconic soldier in the FFVII series, is a very powerful finisher. He is capable of dealing W-casting a 30x mod skill that increases to 34.5x in between LB uses and is one of the highest solo physical DD in the game. He #8217;s able to reach both ATK% and TDH% cap easily, making him gear-friendly as well. --- [Yuffie](#I/Icons/u1376/) Yuffie (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK, +20% ATK w/ Clothes, +1 LB/Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Throwing Weapon** (+172 ATK, +69 MAG, +50% Phys Damage to Birds  amp; +100% ATK when HP falls below 80%, +50% Acc, Variance: 1x~1.6x) **Summary**: Yuffie was one of the reasons why Fixed Dice was nerfed lol. She literally broke the game upon release in JP. She #8217;s a finisher who can imbue herself with fire/ice/thunder while imperilling them at the same time! Her innate passive ATK% from equipping a throwing weapon is what makes her an ideal FD user. She also does more damage against birds. This is her [making some Takoyakis](https://youtu.be/-LaPz638l40) before the damage formula was revamped. --- This second FFVII is also on a 25k lapis banner at max 3 laps with a guaranteed Zack/Yuffie on the last step. More info found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/98rpyo/jp_ffvii_zackyuffie_banners_megathread_820831/) There was also a **FFVII Premium Box** bundle during this banner at a cost of 10k lapis with 1 guaranteed random 5 #9733; FFVII unit, 1x 5 #9733; EX Ticket, 20x Rare Summon Tickets and 2x 10% Trust Moogles. --- #Banner 3  #8211; Regina Story Event [Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/) Regina (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+40 ATK, +25 DEF/SPR  amp; +30% ATK w/ Gun) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% ATK  amp; +50% Phys Damage vs Demon/Machine/Spirit) **Summary**: Meta-finisher Robo girl is here! Regina is a finisher with the highest T1 damage output. Her LB is also severely backloaded with ~78% damage on the last hit. She has one active skill and the rest of her kit basically amplifies that one skill. While her damage is certainly jaw dropping, she does have her weakness- super squishy! This however, can be solved with proper management in battle and/or through gearing. Standard Gun builds make her a true glass cannon with high ATK and about 7k HP at best while Fist builds make much tankier due to the additional HP% derivable from rare Item World Stats; more so if you have Fei #8217;s STMR and Sabin #8217;s STMR. [She can reach almost 2.9k ATK while having 11k HP with a whale build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P12QTICEId4). Regina also has self-reraise and mirages which are very effective in keeping her alive in trials. Her downtimes only occur when she dies. Once back up, she resumes that insane damage output through her V-cast  #8594; LB rotations if you can maintain her MP consumption. --- [Amber](#I/Icons/u1398/) Amber **TMR**: **2h Knuckle** (+130 ATK, +50% Acc, Variance: 1.4x~1.6x) **Summary**: Amber #8217;s TMR is ideal for Regina if you want to pursue the tanky fist build. You get variance multipliers while being able to access an additional 15%/20% HP through rare IW Stats unlike Guns. --- [Vesuvia](#I/Icons/u1401/) Vesuvia **TMR**: **Accessory** (+40 MAG  amp; +40% MAG) **Summary**: TMR is awesome for any mages. Nuff #8217; said. --- [Chrowa](#I/Icons/u1404/) Chrowa **TMR**: **Materia** (+30% MAG  amp; Can Equip Rod) **Summary**: An interesting but seldom used TMR that allows you to equip rods. May have some niche uses. --- Regina is on an 11k lapis step up banner with a 5x chance of getting her on the last step in JP. This will most likely be changed to a 12k lapis banner in GL. Banner info [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9hd5jf/jp_story_event_25_regina_banners_megathread_920930/) For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Regina Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information- [Excerpt from JP megathread]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9hd5kv/jp_story_event_25_regina_event_megathread_920930/) * 1st Wave: **Flickering Presence** (Spirit). Immune to ATK/MAG breaks. Ambush attack that deals AoE 99% HP damage, -50% All Element Resist (5 Turns)  amp; Self +100% DEF/SPR (3 turns). It also has elemental magic and non-elemental magic thresholds. * 2nd Wave: **New Type Magic Weapon** (Machine). Immune to ATK/MAG breaks. High Physical Damage ST/AoE attacks but it can be blinded. A Phys cover tank is highly recommended. Bring AoE status resist skills or build your team for that as well. * 3rd Wave: **Evil Eater** (Demon). Immune to MAG/DEF/SPR breaks. Has AoE elemental magic and AoE phys. It will cast a 50% AOE Death at every 20% HP threshold. If you cross multiples thresholds, it will cast multiples AoE Death. Will ST Dispel every 2 and 4 turns. (Overlapping) ------ #Banner 3  #8211; Summer Fina  amp; Lid / Summer Folk  amp; Citra Fid is one of the first summer units that we #8217;ll be getting and they have already found their way into the game #8217;s unit database as some have pointed out. I wouldn #8217;t be surprised if GL mashes these two units together under one step-up banner. [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) Summer Fina/Lid (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCPdnzynCTw/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+50 MP +3 DEF +3 SPR, +30% MP, +30% SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% DEF/SPR  amp; +60% Thunder/Water/Light Resist) **Summary**: Fid is one of the **best units** ever. They imbue, imperil, reraise and heal! It #8217;s a multi-role duo units unit! They have on-demand W-cast and can double cast their breaks which have an original 60% value but can be boosted to a 74% value after using their CD skill. They also come with substantial HP/MP regen for everyone. To add on, they provide a chaining ability for the entire team! So if you don #8217;t have Pod153 TMR, you need not worry. The chaining ability belongs to the AR family and is locked to water. And to top it off, they can **AoE Reraise**. Imo, Fid is a definite UoC candidate. --- [Summer Folka  amp; Citra](#I/Icons/u1392/) Summer Folka  amp; Citra (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrdGHZsed3Y/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Staff** (+15 ATK, +58 MAG, +120 SPR, +20% SPR  amp; +1 ES/Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% HP/MP  amp; +60% Ice/Water/Dark Resist) **Summary**: Foltra was the 2nd summer unit released in JP last year. She #8217;s an elemental (water/light) evoke damage dealer that chains with the AT family. Because of how her damage is scaled (0:100/ MAG: SPR), she can output huge amounts of damage while staying extremely tanky. This aspect makes her an ideal unit against trials like Moon Kai as shown [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWA96TlQtYM). Foltra also supports the team through her break/ailment protection and provides considerable MP regeneration as well. Like Fid, she can also grant the entire team an AR chaining water skill. Overall, she #8217;s a powerful unit with various uses and is UoC worthy. -- In JP, these two summer pairs were obtained differently: * Summer Fina/Lid was made available via a [8,000 Lapis bundle](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9650dc/jp_story_event_24_banners_megathread_810820/) * Summer Folka/Citra was on a 7k lapis banner at max 3 laps with 5x chance of getting them on the last step. They were also made available via a [8,000 Lapis one-time purchase bundle](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9hd5jf/jp_story_event_25_regina_banners_megathread_920930/) in JP. Both are eventually made available in the UoC pool. --- #Banner 4  #8211; Anniversary Units [Dress up Eileen](#I/Icons/u1437/) Dress-up Aileen (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+60% ATK when equipped with Gun  amp; +100% Blind/Sleep/Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Gun** (+180 ATK, Damage Variance: 1.3-1.7x) **Summary**: Dress-up Aileen chains with both PD and AT families. She has on-demand W-cast and unlocks T-cast through her abilities. She can imbue herself with either earth/light and imperils earth by 75%. Her maxed LB at 7 #9733; provides her with 100% machine/stone killer while boosting the damage modifiers on some of her skills. Aileen #8217;s innate passive yields a 150% with her own Trust Ability. What #8217;s special about her is that she can W/T-cast her attacking abilities together with **Entrust**. This is huge especially if you #8217;re running units that are heavily reliant on their LBs for damage like Esther for example or if you need an LB like LM Fina #8217;s for a quick safety net when her CD is down. --- [Kimono Ayaka](#I/Icons/u1434/) Kimono Ayaka (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Robes** (+22 DEF +68 SPR +30% Light Resist, Skills: +10% ATK/DEF/HP/MAG/SPR/MP Equipped Esper) [STMR](/#label-red): **Hat** (+8 DEF +94 SPR, Skills: +20% MP  amp; Gain 2 LS per Turn) **Summary**: Kimono Ayaka is quite different from the OG Ayaka. Her LB is now a physical attack that scales with 100% SPR as MAG that also buffs herself with 200% SPR. She loses Curaja and Re-raise in her white magic kit too. K.Ayaka comes with innate dual wield and dual wield mastery (6x chain cap bonus) while gaining ATK/SPR% when equipped with Staves and MAG/SPR% when DW. She chains with AT/GC families and can imbue herself with either light or fire. One of her AT skills also debuffs ST by 60% DEF/SPR. K.Ayaka also comes with on-demand W-cast for most of her abilities. --- DU Aileen and K.Ayaka was available through a special banner deal in JP where you get either of them guaranteed through a 5,000 Lapis (10+1) pull and is limited to one per player.

Expect this to be different in GL. --- #Upcoming Collabs  #8211; Octopath Traveller And we come to the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs! A place where we have to **work hard** for time-limited rainbows! With the entire series of XG finally pushed out, we are now left with another major Collab  #8211; Octopath Traveler. There are also other pending re-run events such as Just Cause, Tomb Raider and ~~Secret of Mana~~ which we know nothing of their return dates. --- ###Octopath Traveler Octopath Traveler is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released worldwide on July 13, 2018 and was collaborated with FFBE JP almost simultaneously. These are the units: [Primrose](#I/Icons/u1336/) Primrose (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+16 DEF, +40 SPR, +40% SPR, +100% Petrify Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG, +60% SPR  amp; 80% Chance Ignore up to 1 Fatal Attacks when HP above 40%) **Summary**: Primrose is like Soleil v10. She #8217;s is an insane buffer with 200% stat boosts in her LB along with AoE HP/MP heals over time and AoE LB fill. She comes with on-demand W-cast for her dances. Her regular dance moves provide 130% stat boosts and her CD ability comes with 40% damage mitigation that unlocks 160% stat boosts. She can even provide charm protection as a bonus. Her kit also includes killer boosts for Beasts/Dragons/Plants/Spirits, dark imbue (which can be W-cast) and dark imperil. The only thing she really lacks is an assortment of elemental resistance buffs. Other than that, she is a solid buffer for any team. --- [Olberic](#I/Icons/u1339/) Olberic (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% HP, +20% DEF, +100% Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Light Armor** (+1000 HP, +62 DEF, +55 SPR, +20% ATK/DEF) **Summary**: Olberic is a physical tank with innate provoke and 50% draw. His LB has a 40% damage mitigation. His CD unlocks a better cover ability with up to 80% damage reduction. As a plus, he can chain with the AR family which AoE debuffs by 80% wind/earth and he is capable of ST breaking for 60% value. His STMR has an insane 1,000 HP with decent DEF/SPR stats and a 20% DEF boost. Considering how we didn #8217;t get Gabranth whose STMR is a helmet with +1000 HP +18 ATK +81 DEF and +20% HP, this can be considered a great addition for anyone building up the ultimate beefy tank. --- [Therion](#I/Icons/u1342/) Therion **TMR**: **Accessory** (+12 ATK, +26 DEF, +30% Camouflage, +20% Physical Evade) **Summary**: TMR is excellent for dodge builds if you didn #8217;t farm Twenty-sided Die or don #8217;t have Ring of Lucii. --- [Tressa](#I/Icons/u1345/) Tressa **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% ATK/MAG, +25% EXP gained from battles) **Summary**: A good addition to EXP items for levelling units. --- Octopath Traveler had a ticket campaign where players would receive 1 Primrose/Olberic Ticket for every 10+1 summon done and can exchange for a Primrose/Olberic of choice with 5 ticket pieces. There was also a [**one-time**](/tg) 5,000 Lapis with a **guaranteed either Primrose/Olberic**. You don #8217;t get any Primrose/Olberic tickets for this one though.

    <TITLE>Minimal Gearing Requirements for damage dealers for Scorn of Octopus Teacher</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-28 21:39:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Cross referencing with /u/Sinzar_'s [Tips for Scorn of Tako Sensei](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/blmsqi/tips_for_scorn_of_the_octopus_teacher/) for ease of navigation. Building the latest shinest damage dealers with full elemental immunity for this thursday's trial isn't mandatory as long as the rest of your support/tank is properly geared. The first item is [Barrier Bracer](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Barrier_Bracer). It gives 30% water/wind/earth triple resistance and 20% HP. You don't lose much attack while gaining a decent amount of resistance and added survivability. The second item is Ribbon/Discernment. This will be the first and start of many trials to come that **imperils status ailment resistance**. Combining this together with units that provide ailment protection such as Folka will soon become bread and butter. Even though for this trial, only the provoke tank needs these items, there's no harm in gearing your other units with them. Friends will definitely appreciate that. Looking at Esther/Akstar/Zeno, you can gear them with both of these items. * **Esther**: Only needs 1 Storm Kicker to unlock her Trust Ability. The other accessory slot can fit Barrier Bracer. And she can use Discernment/Hairpin of Purity for full ailment resistance. * **Akstar**: Only needs 1 Rush Glove to unlock his Trust Ability. Equipping his own TMR grants 200% TDH. Most veteran players by now would have at least one Buster Style TMR. If not, you can use Doublehand/Tomb Raider/Swift Hunter to supplement if you're not using his STMR. * **Zeno**: By far the most versatile of the 3 latest DDs. He can free up BOTH accessory slots while still sitting at a very high ATK value. You can slap both Barrier Bracer/Ribbon on him or Barrier Bracer/Discernment. I hope this alleviates gearing woes for the many. Cheers and good luck on the trial!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Condensed SYP - Summer Fina/Lid  amp; Summer Folka/Citra</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-30 02:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**Obligatory Disclaimer**](/tg): Non-official post. Skillset/names subject to changes. Looks like I was right about Gumi mashing both Summer units together on a single banner in my [GL Monthly Oulook - June edition](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bqlv62/gl_monthly_outlook_june/) afterall! In light of this wonderful prediction, I present to you - a condensed SYP. #[Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) Summer Fina/Lid (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCPdnzynCTw/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Mog Beach Ball** (Accessory, +50 MP +3 DEF +3 SPR, +30% MP, +30% SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Beach Girls** (Materia, +50% DEF/SPR  amp; +60% Thunder/Water/Light Resist) [Reddit Unit Wiki Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1361) | [Exvius DB Unit Link](https://exvius.gg/jp/units/100020505/) | [FFBE Wiki Link](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Summer_Fina_%26_Lid) **Breakdown**: Featured Skill | Description | ---|---| Limit Break | AoE 3 Turn -45/75% ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR Debuff  amp; AoE 3 Turn +70/100% Water Resist Shaved Ice | If **[Beach House Break](/gt)** Used Last Turn, Use [AoE 5 Turn -74% DEF Debuff  amp; AoE 5 Turn -100% Ice/Water Resist](/gt), Else ST 5 Turn -60% DEF Debuff  amp; ST 5 Turn -75% Ice/Water Resist Watermelon Splitting | If **[Beach House Break](/gt)** Used Last Turn, Use [AoE 5 Turn -74% SPR Debuff  amp; AoE 5 Turn -100% Water/Earth Resist](/gt), Else ST 5 Turn -60% SPR Debuff  amp; ST 5 Turn -75% Water/Earth Resist Beach Attack | If **[Beach House Break](/gt)** Used Last Turn, Use [AoE 5 Turn -74% ATK Debuff  amp; AoE 5 Turn -100% Fire/Water Resist](/gt), Else ST 5 Turn -60% ATK Debuff  amp; ST 5 Turn -75% Fire/Water Resist Summer Sun | If **[Beach House Break](/gt)** Used Last Turn, Use [AoE 5 Turn -74% MAG Debuff  amp; AoE 5 Turn -100% Thunder/Water Resist](/gt), Else ST 5 Turn -60% MAG Debuff  amp; ST 5 Turn -75% Thunder/Water Resist Ultimate Siesta | (Available Turn 1) 10 Turn Cooldown: AoE 3 Turn Auto-Revive with 80% HP  amp; AoE 2 Turn -74% ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR Debuff Beach House Break | (Available Turn 1) 6 Turn Cooldown: AoE 75% HP Recovery  amp; AoE Fill 14 LS --- **Pros** * One thing to note is that Fid's LB only costs 28 LS. With a 10 LS/turn build coupled with their 2 LS/turn passive, they can maintain LB break very easily. This means a 100% uptime of 75% debuff! * Using Beach House Break followed by a debuff of your choice upgrades it from 60% to 74% break value and from 75% to 100% imperil value. She covers a total of **FIVE** elemental imperils - fire/water/ice/thunder/earth. This makes them extremely versatile for any trial. * Equipping their TMR unlocks on-demand W-cast for most of their abilities so you'll definitely want to moogle their TMR ASAP. Plus, that 30% MP/SPR is nice too. * Able to AoE imbue water element. * Has Curaja level of healing with flat MP recovery. * Unlocks a strong HP/MP regen over time with Chaotic Darkness Series Boss Battle. * Boosts physical/magical damage vs Aquan race (~~30%~~ 40%) which comes in handy in the upcoming Scorn of Tako Sensei trial. Not to mention she also boosts water resistance. * Fid is capable of bestowing everyone with a water AR chaining skill, essentially removing the need for POD153 Accessory, making them an ideal candidate of choice to pair with a finisher like Cid or Regina. --- **Cons** * She does not have any other form of reraise other than her CD skill. She also does not have any ST raises but this can be compensated with Phoenix 3 #9733; Esper with Raise node unlocked. * 20% chance of AoE charming your team on their imbue ability. * No dispelga. Can be compensated by using items like Aura Staff for ST dispels only. * Sakura is not included in the unit's design outside of the LB animation... --- [**SYP?**](/tg): Yes. She is one of the best utility units with a very long shelf life filling multiple roles in your team. #[Summer Folka  amp; Citra](#I/Icons/u1392/) Summer Folka  amp; Citra (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrdGHZsed3Y/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Summer Parasol** (Staff, +15 ATK, +58 MAG, +120 SPR, +20% SPR  amp; +1 ES/Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **Cool Beauty** (Materia, +50% HP/MP  amp; +60% Ice/Water/Dark Resist) [Reddit Unit Wiki Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1392) | [Exvius DB Unit Link](https://exvius.gg/jp/units/100020905/) | [FFBE Wiki Link](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Summer_Folka_%26_Citra) **Breakdown**: Featured Skill | Description ---|---| Rippling Waves | 5 Turn AoE +100% Poison/Blind/Sleep/Silence Resist  amp; AoE 5 Turn +100% DEF/SPR/Stop Debuff Resist  amp; AoE 5 Turn +60% Water Resist Gleaming Sun | 5 Turn AoE +100% Paralyze/Confuse/Virus/Petrify Resist  amp; AoE 5 Turn +100% ATK/Charm/MAG Debuff Resist  amp; AoE 5 Turn +60% Light Resist Summon - Sunshine | 0%/300% (0:100 MAG:SPR) ST 7 Hit Light Summon Attack  amp; 0%/1800% (0:100 MAG:SPR) ST 1 Hit Light Summon Attack [**AT frames**] Summon - Waves | 0%/300% (0:100 MAG:SPR) ST 7 Hit Water Summon Attack  amp; 0%/1800% (0:100 MAG:SPR) ST 1 Hit Water Summon Attack [**AT frames**] Summon - Sparkling Wave | (Available Turn 6) 6 Turn Cooldown: 0%/800% (0:100 MAG:SPR) AoE 7 Hit Water/Light Summon Attack  amp; 0%/3500% (0:100 MAG:SPR) AoE 1 Hit Water/Light Summon Attack  amp; AoE ~2500 HP Heal w/ 18x Mod  amp; AoE 3 Turn 30% Damage Reduction [**AT frames**] Hide Tide Spirit | 200% AoE 7 Hit Water Magic Attack w/ 100% of SPR as MAG  amp; 1000% AoE 1 Hit Water Magic Attack w/ 100% of SPR as MAG  amp; Fill Summon Gauge 2-4 ES  amp; AoE ~1000 HP Heal w/ 3.4x Mod [**AT frames**] **Pros** * Has both key aspects of Folka and Citra - ailment/debuff protection and evoke damage. Their ailment protection covers every status ailment except berserk. * Evoke damage scales off **100% SPR**. Their BiS makes them extremely tanky against magic damage while being able to dish out an immense amount of damage. Don't forget that evoke damage **bypasses mitigation** as capitalized [here against Asura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIGkfmNBAPc). Their natural tankiness against magic damage also makes them a prime candiate to use against Scorn of the Bloody Moon as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWA96TlQtYM). * Evoke damage **chains with AT family**. Now this is HUGE. The evoke damage abilities are backloaded, which can be amplified with elemental chaining modifiers for even more damage! Plus, the AT family has many units to chain with. * Able to equip Heavy Armors. For those fortunate players with Wilhelm's STMR, you can slap it on them for that immense SPR boost. * Able to AoE imbue light element. * Boosts physical/magical damage vs Demon/Undead (30%). * Like Fid, Foltra is also capable of bestowing everyone with a water AR chaining skill. --- **Cons** * Niche uses. With more powerful magic damage dealers taking the spotlight such as Sol/CG Dark Fina, she is hardly ever seen anywhere else after Scorn of the Bloody Moon * ~~Lacks flat MP recovery~~ * No way of curing status ailments outside of their counter. * Fina isn't included in the unit's design outside of the LB animation... --- [**SYP**](/tg): Depends. If you want to take down the Moon on Day 1, by all means, go for it. Else, she **is not a must-have**. #Conclusion Between the two, Fid  gt; Foltra because of the level of utility they provide for your team. The downside is that they are together on the same banner and the chances of us getting the 8k Lapis bundles that JP had is incredibly slim: * Summer Fina/Lid's [bundle](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9650dc/jp_story_event_24_banners_megathread_810820/) * Summer Folka/Citra's [bundle](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9hd5jf/jp_story_event_25_regina_banners_megathread_920930/) The good news is that you can UoC either of them once their banner ends! Good luck to everyone that's pulling and may the rainbows ever be in your favor.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Condensed Should You Pull- Regina</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-06 23:34:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**Wow the World Disclaimer**](/tg): Non-official post. Data/skillset subject to changes at Gumi's discretion. Hello and welcome to another CSYP! This time, we look at Regina the Automaton! #[Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/) Regina (5-7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): Power Amplifier (**Hat**, +40 ATK +25 DEF, +25 SPR, +30% ATK when equipped with Gun) [STMR](/#lable-red): Battle Intelligence (**Materia**, +60% ATK +50% physical/hybrid damage to Demons, Machines, Spirits) [Reddit Link Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/1395?utm_source=share amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) | [Exvius DB Link](https://exvius.gg/jp/units/100017505/) | [FFBE Wiki Link](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Regina) **Breakdown** Featured Skill | Description ---|---| Enemy Eradication (Limit Break) | Physical damage (16x) with ignore DEF (50%) to all enemies. Decrease ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR (200%) for 3 turns to caster. Inflict stop (100%) for 3 turns to caster Regina Cannon | Physical damage (1x) with ignore DEF (50%) to one enemy. Increase LB damage (120%) for 2 turns to caster (can't be dispelled) Speed Mode | Negate 3 physical damage taken for 2 turns to caster. Increase LB gauge (25) to caster. Increase modifier (2x) for 1 turn to caster (can't be dispelled): Regina Cannon Penta Tactics | Enable unit to use 5 different of the following abilities in one turn: Anti-Demon Module, Anti-Fairy Module, Anti-Machine Module, Barrier Mode, Cana's System, Defense Mode, Offense Mode, Power Generator, Reboot Command, Regina Cannon, Speed Mode Reboot Command | Cure ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR break to caster. Increase LB gauge (25) to caster. Increase modifier (8x) for 1 turn to caster (can't be dispelled): Regina Cannon Power Generator | **[4 turns cooldown, available on turn 1]** Increase ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR (250%) for 2 turns to caster. Increase LB gauge (25) to caster. Increase modifier (10x) for 1 turn to caster (can't be dispelled): Regina Cannon Cana's Systems | **[4 turns cooldown, available on turn 1]** Auto-revive (100% HP) for 2 turns to caster. Increase LB gauge (25) to caster. Increase modifier (10x) for 1 turn to caster (can't be dispelled): Regina Cannon **Pros** * Extremely high T1 Damage (2 CDs, Reboot Command and any "Module" ability = 68x base mod) * LB is severely backloaded (1st 22 hits 1% damage, last hit 78% damage). Chains with a dupe. * Has self-casting mirage to dodge 3 stray/uncovered physical attacks. This comes in handy against certain bosses with uncoverable attacks. * Has V-combo: able to select up to 4 other ability to boost sole attacking skill. Each ability boosts LB gauge by 25 LS. So 4 abilities would charge up a full LB allowing her to use LB on every alternate turn. * Able to self cure ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR breaks. Immune to Stop via Trust Ability. **Cons** * Very low HP. Comparing Regina with the following other units based on their HP using the data from ExviusDB ([**Note**](/tg): HP/DEF/SPR values are Pots + Passives.): Unit | HP | DEF | SPR ---|---|---|---| [Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/) | 6,198 | 193 | 193 [CG Akstar](#I/Icons/u1324/) | 7,007 | 278 | 349 [Zeno of the Beta Star](#I/Icons/u8253/) | 8,287 | 357 | 279 [Esther](#I/Icons/u8229/) | 10,792 | 417 | 288 [CG Lightning](#I/Icons/u1445/) | 8,385 | 342 | 328 [(CG) Light Warrior Bartz](#I/Icons/u1481/) | 8,572 | 278 | 337 [CG Onion Knight](#I/Icons/u1577/) | 9,130 | 360 | 352 * One of the units with the highest MP consumption per turn (312 MP on T1). * Requires **substantial external support**. Regina has no self-imbue/imperil, requires a pair of chainers to effectively function as a finisher and needs constant healthy MP recovery/refreshes. #Conclusion Regina is a solid finisher and will be useful for upcoming raids with the more damage/more coin system and possibly Holy Shrine of Eltira (if we get it) featuring multiple floors with various bosses at an incremental difficulty level as long as you can provide the required support she needs. Just an extra note, while most Regina BiS builds feature a gun build maximizing LB damage, she has an alternate, tankier build using Fists. This is due to the rare IW ability that Fists can get: 15-20% HP depending on whether it is featured as a boosted equipment. Also, if you somehow managed to get Fei and/or Sabin's STMR, you can utilize [this build](https://youtu.be/cE6Wu6hdvrg) which gives Regina 11k HP and 2.9k ATK. Other interesting (whale) Regina videos: * [FTKO Gilgamesh w FD](https://youtu.be/LbDNRUN167A) * [2TKO Scorn of Elafikeras](https://youtu.be/ahYGwuMy2pw) * [7TKO Scorn of Aigaion](https://youtu.be/cSG1wRbbOlQ) * [4TKO Scorn of Bomb Family](https://youtu.be/WS9uJnS5424) [**SYP**](/tg): If you've been wanting one of strongest finisher, pull for her. Else, she's pretty skippable if you've got Bunny girl, Sabin or Zeno. For me, I was ready for a 12k/lap banner but the cost got doubled so I'm not going with it.</TEXT>

Will GL follow JP #8217;s footsteps or will the meme  #8220;GL is a different game #8221; finally materialize into an actual concept? Find out in ~4 months #8217; time! #Banner Info Compilation [**NEW**](/tg): For all upcoming banner info, please check out my [Banner Compilation List](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bj924w/gl_upcoming_banners_compilation_list/). It provides information for the banners in JP to help you prep in advance for the units that you are looking to pull. I #8217;ve sorted them accordingly based on Story Event Units, KM Units, Raid Units and Summon Festival Units for ease of navigation. I #8217;m actively maintaining this thread to keep up with the latest banners in GL/JP. --- #Banner 1  #8211; Anniversary Units We are only a couple of days away from GL #8217;s 3rd Anniversary! JP had the following units for their anniversary though it is questionable as to whether we we #8217;ll get them or some GLEX banner. [Dress up Eileen](#I/Icons/u1437/) Dress-up Aileen (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+60% ATK when equipped with Gun  amp; +100% Blind/Sleep/Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Gun** (+180 ATK, Damage Variance: 1.3-1.7x) **Summary**: Dress-up Aileen chains with both PD and AT families. She has on-demand W-cast and unlocks T-cast through her abilities. She can imbue herself with either earth/light and imperils earth by 75%. Her maxed LB at 7 #9733; provides her with 100% machine/stone killer while boosting the damage modifiers on some of her skills. Aileen #8217;s innate passive yields a 150% with her own Trust Ability. What #8217;s special about her is that she can W/T-cast her attacking abilities together with **Entrust**. This is huge especially if you #8217;re running units that are heavily reliant on their LBs for damage like Esther for example or if you need an LB like LM Fina #8217;s for a quick safety net when her CD is down. --- [Kimono Ayaka](#I/Icons/u1434/) Kimono Ayaka (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Robes** (+22 DEF +68 SPR +30% Light Resist, Skills: +10% ATK/DEF/HP/MAG/SPR/MP Equipped Esper) [STMR](/#label-red): **Hat** (+8 DEF +94 SPR, Skills: +20% MP  amp; Gain 2 LS per Turn) **Summary**: Kimono Ayaka is quite different from the OG Ayaka. Her LB is now a physical attack that scales with 100% SPR as MAG that also buffs herself with 200% SPR. She loses Curaja and Re-raise in her white magic kit too. K.Ayaka comes with innate dual wield and dual wield mastery (6x chain cap bonus) while gaining ATK/SPR% when equipped with Staves and MAG/SPR% when DW. She chains with AT/GC families and can imbue herself with either light or fire. One of her AT skills also debuffs ST by 60% DEF/SPR. K.Ayaka also comes with on-demand W-cast for most of her abilities. --- DU Aileen and K.Ayaka was available through a special banner deal in JP where you get either of them guaranteed through a 5,000 Lapis (10+1) pull and is limited to one per player. More info on their banner found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9qmtj6/jp_featured_banners_megathread_10231031/) --- #Banner 2  #8211; FFVII (2) This is the second part of the FFVII banner through a raid event featuring Zack and Yuffie. However, we got the elusive SD3 instead for our monthly raid! So this banner will most likely be pushed to next month. [Zack](#I/Icons/u1373/) Zack (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **2h Greatsword** (+145 ATK, +50% Accuracy, Variance: 1x~1.6x) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+40% ATK w/ Greatsword, +25% Accuracy, +100% TDH) **Summary**: Zack, another iconic soldier in the FFVII series, is a very powerful finisher. He is capable of dealing W-casting a 30x mod skill that increases to 34.5x in between LB uses and is one of the highest solo physical DD in the game. He #8217;s able to reach both ATK% and TDH% cap easily, making him gear-friendly as well. --- [Yuffie](#I/Icons/u1376/) Yuffie (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+30% ATK, +20% ATK w/ Clothes, +1 LB/Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **2h Throwing Weapon** (+172 ATK, +69 MAG, +50% Phys Damage to Birds  amp; +100% ATK when HP falls below 80%, +50% Acc, Variance: 1x~1.6x) **Summary**: Yuffie was one of the reasons why Fixed Dice was nerfed lol. She literally broke the game upon release in JP. She #8217;s a finisher who can imbue herself with fire/ice/thunder while imperilling them at the same time! Her innate passive ATK% from equipping a throwing weapon is what makes her an ideal FD user. She also does more damage against birds. This is her [making some Takoyakis](https://youtu.be/-LaPz638l40) before the damage formula was revamped. --- This second FFVII is also on a 25k lapis banner at max 3 laps with a guaranteed Zack/Yuffie on the last step. More info found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/98rpyo/jp_ffvii_zackyuffie_banners_megathread_820831/) There was also a **FFVII Premium Box** bundle during this banner at a cost of 10k lapis with 1 guaranteed random 5 #9733; FFVII unit, 1x 5 #9733; EX Ticket, 20x Rare Summon Tickets and 2x 10% Trust Moogles. --- #Banner 3  #8211; FFXIII [CG Lightning](#I/Icons/u1445/) CG Lightning (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCPF4b1XfQ/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+100% TDW) [STMR](/#label-red): **1h Sword** (+169 ATK, +50% TDW  amp; 1.3x LB Damage) **Summary**: CG Lightning was supposedly the original TDW pioneer, ushering the new meta in JP back then. However, Zeno has stolen her limelight in GL! Her TMR is similar to Cloud #8217;s TMR, except that its TDW instead of TDH and will most likely be unstackable in GL. Her STMR is a 1h sword with additional 50% TDW and boosts LB damage by 1.3x. Lightning also has TDW Mastery and benefits from a 6x chain cap instead of 4x. Her LB sits at a max of **Lv 40** instead of 30 so it #8217;ll require a lot more Burst Pots to max it out. It has a 120% lightning imperil and boosts the modifiers of her chaining skills. She mainly chains with the AT family while also capable of AR/DR chains. She can imbue/imperil thunder through a single ability similar to Esther (though at 80% imperil instead of 100%). Like Zeno, she also has permanent 10% damage mitigation. Lightning also comes with on-demand W-cast for her abilities. Overall she #8217;s a strong upgrade for anyone who didn #8217;t pull on Zeno/Esther banners. Plus she has other nifty utilities like 60-70% debuffs, full raise and even Curaga in her kit. --- [Future Hope](#I/Icons/u1448/) Future Hope (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **1h Dagger** (+18 ATK, +117 MAG, +65 SPR) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+50% MAG, +30% MP, +100% Light Resist) **Summary**: Hope #8217;s LB imperils for 100% across all elements for 1 turn and also strikes the enemy with an all-out octo-elemental attack. He has  #8211;ga levels of green magic for fire/thunder/water/ice and a 5T ribbon buff. Hope can also imbue thunder onto any ally for 3T. He chains with Quake/GC/AT families and has on-demand W-cast. Unlike MS Nichol who debuffs his own team mates, Hope debuffs the enemies while buffing the team and these abilities can be W-casted. He can also prevent stop while covering 100% light/dark resistance and has innate confuse/stop resist. His CD ability is an AoE 4T 180% stat buff + 40% damage mitigation on a 7T cooldown. Hope #8217;s quite the support unit but depending on what you need more for your team in a trial, MS Nichol/Sylvie/Zarg may be better. --- CG Lightning and Future Hope are guaranteed units on a 25k Lapis banner in JP. There was also a separate 3k Lapis banner with 2x 5 #9733; unit rates. More info found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9szg70/jp_ffxiii_7_cg_lightning_future_hope_banners/). [**Note**](/tg): **Sazh** and **Snow** are **bonus KM units** during this event! Keep multiple copies of them if you aren #8217;t planning on pulling for the featured units. --- #Banner 4  #8211; CG Charlotte Story Event [CG Charlotte](#I/Icons/u1422/) Charlotte (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT-2XoXpzlY/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Hat** (+200 HP, +50 MP, +25 DEF, +50 SPR, +10% HP/MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Heavy Shield** (+68 DEF, +118 SPR, +20% HP/SPR  amp; +50% Ice/Light Resist) **Summary**: The ultimate magic tank has arrived! Charlotte #8217;s main selling point is her extremely high levels of damage mitigation values while incorporating all the key traits of a great magic tank. She has innate 50% draw, Guts, Provoke and magic cover ability. Charlotte #8217;s LB costs only 22 LS and not only boosts damage mitigation by 50% but it also refreshes her magic cover! She has on-demand 30% magic damage mitigation and has a 40% chance of countering magic damage which is further boosted by her maxed 7 #9733; passive by 1.3x. This allows her to generate plenty of LS crystals which work in tandem with her LB. Unlike Awakened Rain, she **does not have a passive cover at all**! With trials getting more punishing, you need not worry about her screwing your team over by randomly covering an ally. She can even chain with the GC family and her kit covers light/ice imperil (80%) if you need her to do something else other than covering magic attacks. Charlotte is a prime candidate for UoC and shines against heavy magic hitting trials like Scorn of the Bloody Moon. --- [Friese](#I/Icons/u1425/) Friese **TMR**: **Heavy Armor** (+40 DEF, +101 SPR  amp; 5% MP/Turn) **Summary**: Superb TMR that boasts MASSIVE SPR. This is just 9 points short of Wilhelm #8217;s STMR! Friese #8217;s TMR works wonderfully on Charlotte and on any other unit that scales off SPR for damage like Summer Folka/Citra. --- [Shepard](#I/Icons/u1428/) Shepard **TMR**: **Materia** (+30% Water/Wind/Earth Resist  amp; +15% HP) **Summary**: 30% Triple elemental coverage with 15% HP? Sign me up! --- Charlotte was on both a 11k  amp; 25k lapis step up banner in JP. Banner info [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9mxgw3/jp_story_event_26_charlotte_banners_megathread/). For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Charlotte Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information- [Excerpt from JP megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9mxgvx/jp_story_event_26_charlotte_event_megathread/) * 1st Wave: **Io Lv99  amp; 2x Security Eye** (Machine). Io Vulnerable to ATK/MAG debuffs. Uses Lightning magic attacks and normal attacks. It summons the Security Eyes on T3. * 2nd Wave: **Erinyes** (Demon). Uses pre-amptive Reflect. Vulnerable to ATK/MAG debuffs. Deals mainly light damage. The damage it deals is reduced by attacking it with lightning attacks. * 3rd Wave: **Oriax** (Demon). Vulnerable to MAG/SPR debuffs. Uses very strong non-elemental magic attack on T1. Subsequent attacks are all elemental-based. --- #Upcoming Trials |No.|Chamber of Fallen|Chamber of Indignant (Scorn/Kai)| --:|:--|:--| |Next in Line|[Shinryu](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a60u2z/jp_trial_shinryu_%E3%81%97%E3%82%93%E3%82%8A%E3%82%85%E3%81%86/)|[Lich](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9celt8/jp_trial_20_lich/)| |2|-|[Glacial Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9kw851/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_glacial/)| |3|-|[Bloody Moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9u2s6a/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bloody_moon/)| |4|-|[Elafikeras](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a1emof/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_elafikeras/)| |5||[Aigaion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/afdtcj/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_aigaion_kai/)| |6|-|[Iron Giant](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aq2re6/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_iron_giant/)| |7|-|[Bomb Family](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b0bhpv/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bomb_family/)| |8|-|[Demon Wall](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bc9vk3/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_demon_wall/)| |9|-|[Tiamat](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/br3xu4/jp_guide_scorn_of_tiamat_trial/)| |10|-|[Great Malboro and Malboro Queen](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/by6vli/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_malboro_great_malboro/)| --- **Series Boss Battle (SBB)** SBB is a new set of trials released together with a specific FF series.

Expect this to be different in GL. --- #Upcoming Collabs  #8211; Octopath Traveller And we come to the most exciting speculation corner  #8211; Collabs! A place where we have to **work extra hard** for time-limited rainbows! Seiken Densetsu 3 finally made it to GL! It was a one heck of a wait. But were the units actually worth it apart from pure nostalgia? Does this mean we *might also* get to see the likes of Riesz, Kevin and Hawkeye?! Let #8217;s not forget that we are also due for Octopath Traveller! In other news, JC3 is confirmed for a re-run while Tomb Raider did not make the cut. ###Octopath Traveler Octopath Traveler is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released worldwide on July 13, 2018 and was collaborated with FFBE JP almost simultaneously. These are the units: [Primrose](#I/Icons/u1336/) Primrose (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+16 DEF, +40 SPR, +40% SPR, +100% Petrify Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG, +60% SPR  amp; 80% Chance Ignore up to 1 Fatal Attacks when HP above 40%) **Summary**: Primrose is like Soleil v10. She #8217;s is an insane buffer with 200% stat boosts in her LB along with AoE HP/MP heals over time and AoE LB fill. She comes with on-demand W-cast for her dances. Her regular dance moves provide 130% stat boosts and her CD ability comes with 40% damage mitigation that unlocks 160% stat boosts. She can even provide charm protection as a bonus. Her kit also includes killer boosts for Beasts/Dragons/Plants/Spirits, dark imbue (which can be W-cast) and dark imperil. The only thing she really lacks is an assortment of elemental resistance buffs. Other than that, she is a solid buffer for any team. --- [Olberic](#I/Icons/u1339/) Olberic (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% HP, +20% DEF, +100% Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Light Armor** (+1000 HP, +62 DEF, +55 SPR, +20% ATK/DEF) **Summary**: Olberic is a physical tank with innate provoke and 50% draw. His LB has a 40% damage mitigation. His CD unlocks a better cover ability with up to 80% damage reduction. As a plus, he can chain with the AR family which AoE debuffs by 80% wind/earth and he is capable of ST breaking for 60% value. His STMR has an insane 1,000 HP with decent DEF/SPR stats and a 20% DEF boost. Considering how we didn #8217;t get Gabranth whose STMR is a helmet with +1000 HP +18 ATK +81 DEF and +20% HP, this can be considered a great addition for anyone building up the ultimate beefy tank. --- [Therion](#I/Icons/u1342/) Therion **TMR**: **Accessory** (+12 ATK, +26 DEF, +30% Camouflage, +20% Physical Evade) **Summary**: TMR is excellent for dodge builds if you didn #8217;t farm Twenty-sided Die or don #8217;t have Ring of Lucii. --- [Tressa](#I/Icons/u1345/) Tressa **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% ATK/MAG, +25% EXP gained from battles) **Summary**: A good addition to EXP items for levelling units. --- Octopath Traveler had a ticket campaign where players would receive 1 Primrose/Olberic Ticket for every 10+1 summon done and can exchange for a Primrose/Olberic of choice with 5 ticket pieces. There was also a [**one-time**](/tg) 5,000 Lapis with a **guaranteed either Primrose/Olberic**. You don #8217;t get any Primrose/Olberic tickets for this one though.

Finally time for the long awaited collab with Secret of... Evermore! Who needs Seiken Densetsu 3?

It draws various aspects from FFBE and features a 3D tactical RPG gameplay system.  gt; This is the story of Ardora, a continent of Lapis. A tiny spark here ignites the flames that would embroil an entire continent in conflict. A continent later spoken of as the War of the Visions. A total of 5 nations engulfed in war with one another: [Leonis](/#label-red): Ruled by the Red Lion Monarch, possesses the power of Visions as well as twin princes. [Hourne](/#label-pink): The great western kingdom governed by a policy of peace and its wise king. [Fennes](/#label-green) Where the king of the savages has organized the barbarian tribes into Ardora's mightiest militant state. [Wezette](/#label): The great eastern kingdom, over which reigns its icy despot. [Crystal Sanctum](/#label-yellow) A religious city-state with believes throughout Ardora, founded by one who claims to be God.  gt; Each burdened with its own dignity, thus is the curtain drawn on a struggle in which the fate of nations rests. All is for One's Homeland...

    <TITLE>Boss Design Contest - Asshole Mechanics</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-30 03:29:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am honestly very interested in this more than fan made units. Finally we get a chance to decide the fate of players! Apart from how the boss looks like, I think we all know what kinda shitty/assholic mechanics that no players would wanna see in any trial. Yet I can't help but feel that the adding some/all of the following gimmicks would no doubt provide more thrill/pressure/challenge to the fight. The data wiz can datamine all they want and post the info for everyone. But you can do little to nothing with the information on hand. Can you feel the helplessness and despair? ###Uncoverable AoE Physical/Magical Damage This is one of the first headaches that come to mind. Damage that no tanks can cover and has to be taken to the face by the entire team- whether it's elemental/non elemental damage, this would force everyone to go elemental tetris or high SPR/DEF and always maintain damage mitigation. ###Undispellable DoT damage As seen in certain trials like Asura, Anima and the recent Scorn of Malboro in JP, this **has to be** one of the most nerve wrecking gimmicks ever introduced. Units sustain a certain amount of fixed damage every turn for a few turns while the DoT remains in effect and can only be removed through death and partially mitigated with through HP regeneration. ###Unprovokable/Undrawable RNG-based Kill Kill, unlike Death, cannot be resisted by items like Safety Bit/Genji Shield etc. If you've fought Lich, you'll know what it is. Let it occur randomly based on RNG and ignore provokes and passive draw. You have absolutely no way of predicting who it will happen to. The only way to bypass it is through constant reraise. ###Unprovokable/Undrawable RNG Snort In certain trials, Snort occurs when you trigger a HP% threshold, kill the main boss while leaving its minions alive or on certain turns. But what about RNG based snorts? Snorts that occur on certain turns that eject a unit for a few turns and cannot be worked around with through passive draw or provoke? How about having your healer blown off the battle for a few turns just when everyone is in dire need of a heal/reraise...? Or when your DPS is at maxed stacks with triple cast **just unlocked** or LB just fully filled and gets ejected when you are seconds away from bursting to victory? ###Mirror-Move Counters Interesting mechanic that I thought of which applies mainly to certain abilities- primarily Heals, Reraise, break resistance and damage mitigation. Happens on the immediate turn after you use the above abilities. If you cast reraise, the boss mirrors you and uses reraise on itself. If you heal, the boss heals itself as well. If you buff break resistance, so does the boss. Buff damage mitigation and the boss mirrors. These mirror counter buffs are undispellable for 3 turns and will naturally fall off. --- What do you think? Of course, the rewards will certainly be generous if you successfully complete the trial. Apart from weapons that high stats, having more lapis (1000-2000 Lapis), more UoCs or even a 50% STMR moogle definitely sounds more enticing than a meagre 50x trust coins.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Upcoming Chamber of the Vengeful will unbench certain units</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-30 18:47:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seeing how the missions require different units to be used, ie. no dupes, this is a great time for certain units to be unbenched and made useful again! I can foresee myself using unit combos like Onion Knight x Sephiroth, Hyoh x Orlandeau, Hyoh x Sephiroth, Raegen x Hyoh, Akstar x Zeno, Akstar x Lasswell, Raegen x Lasswell, Tidus x Kurasame, Lightning x Tidus etc This is getting me all fired up! Let's just hope the rewards don't disappoint. The only current "issue" I foresee is swapping tanks/healers/support units. There are fewer of these units that we can interchange with than damage dealers. Plus, I've converted Mystea/Shylt/WoL for trust coins.....so..... :D What about you?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>More boss mechanics for contest ideas and RNG rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-01 00:51:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I partially understand the hate behind RNG mechanics in bosses. While it is definitely somewhat lazy from a player's pov, it sorta mimics reality doesn't it? Sometimes you just don't know your enemies' next move and that's where the challenge is. (I'll probably retract this statement once we get Scorn of the Moon lol) Also, I have another idea for boss mechanics: we've all seen elemental imperils and status ailment imperils. But what about break resistance imperils? It lowers your units' resistance to stat debuffs and immediately applies an AoE ATK/MAG/DEF/SPR debuff. Another one is what I call a reversed Twist of Fate. The boss steals your units' buffs and applies it on itself! And said stolen buffs are undispellable for a few turns. I also do not know if they're looking for a REAL trial boss or something simple but annoying like Hasiko... would be a bummer going through all the effort creating a boss with its full set of mechanics only to wind up as a raid trial.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Based on /u/acloudis's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/c8buv4/ff4_and_ff9_sbb_unlocked_abilities/?utm_source=share amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) on the new skills that some of the oldest units got, namely DKC, I went to do some further research on the information about his Stardust Ray chaining skill. [JP DKC Gamepedia Wiki](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Dark_Knight_Cecil/JP) **Soul Seeker** (10 hits, 72 MP) [Requirement: Clear  #12476; #12525; #12512; #12473;, Ability unlocked at 5 #9733;] Physical damage (19x) with consecutive increase (7 times, 3x each, 40x max) to one enemy Heal (32,000 HP) split over 4 turns to caster Refresh (320 MP) split over 4 turns to caster Enable skill for 5 turns to caster: T-cast --- So not only is the modifier insane, it grants him T-cast for 5 turns! We're talking about a full 120x mod burst after max stacks with T-cast **On DKC**, a formerly suicidal benched unit now fully viable at a monstrous level! If you noticed, one of the biggest perks of the new skill is that it doesn't consume HP! And it provides a ridiculous amount of regen. Does this mean he's able to thrive under DoT inflictions? His new BiS should technically be high ATK 2h GS (like Cloud's STMR) since he **gains 100% TDH from a SBB passive skill**: **Dark Hand** [Requirement: Clear  #12476; #12525; #12512; #12473;] Increase ATK, DEF, HP and MP (50%) Increase physical damage against humans (100%) Increase equipment ATK (100%) and accuracy (25%) when single wielding any weapon Increase LB gauge (9) per turn Increase modifier (30x): Soul Eater, Soul Eater +1, Soul Eater +2, Soul Over. The downside is that both his S/TMR are now completely unviable for his new damage build. --- Went to dig for videos featuring his current damage and found one: https://youtu.be/VoHDZuzWuhI --- DKC Hype! Finally, he receives some mf badass skill to complement his badass sprite. Now to wait 9 months for his SBB to arrive..</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Full Clear 9/9 Missions - CG Charlotte SE Bonus Stage</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-05 10:27:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Full Clear Video: https://youtu.be/a9mVnaXygS4 Equipment found [here](https://youtu.be/a9mVnaXygS4?t=435) Team Used: Unit | Role ---|---| [Awakened Rain](#I/Icons/u954/) | Magic Tank (Over 100% resistance to all elements, 90% resistance to dark, High SPR) [CG Nichol](#I/Icons/u916/) | Buffer/Esper Missions [CG Folka](#I/Icons/u1207/) | Status Ailment/Debuff Protection [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) | Breaker/Imbue [CG Cid](#I/Icons/u1282/) | Brought for funsies [Regina](#I/Icons/u1395/) | Friend companion, the Real Finisher --- ###Phase 1 [**Race**](/gt): [Machine](/#label-yellow) Take note of charm and bring the appropriate charm resistance. Io will summon 2 Security Eyes on turn 3. It's vulnerable to ATK/MAG breaks and primarily uses Lightning based attacks with an innate 100% lightning resistance and innate -30% fire/light weakness. A magic tank with 100% lightning resist will also nullify most of its attacks. I used Nichol to complete the Esper mission here and also booped it with Holy Wand and Firaga for the missions. Thereafter, it's basically an instant KO with a chain capped Regina Cannon. ###Phase 2 [**Race**](/gt): [Demon](/#label-pink) Pre-amptive reflect on itself. Vulnerable to ATK/MAG debuffs and has innate 30% lightning resistance. Primarily uses light-elemental attacks followed by multi elemental attacks. If you have a magic tank that has 100% resistance to all elements, this boss does literally nothing to you and it's mainly about completing the missions here. I used Rain with Lightning Saber to poke it for the mission before blasting it away with another chained capped Regina Cannon ###Phase 3 [**Race**](/gt): [Demon](/#label-pink) [**Very strong first turn magic attack**](/tg). Use reraise on your magic tank here on the first turn and make sure your magic cover is up! Oriax is vulnerable to MAG/SPR debuffs and it has 50% innate resistance to all elements with a -30% innate weakness to water element. This was the only part of the fight where I chain capped with both Regina and Cid to ensure the kill. --- Overall, if you have a very strong breaker like Fid, all their physical attacks are very weak. So you can forgo the use of a physical tank completely if your magic tank is well geared for the fight. [Bonus](/#label): [Pulled 2x Charlottes on my first 2.5k pull!](https://www.amhnn.com/2019/07/2500-lapis-summon-2x-charlotte.html)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: Consider running both Ragnarok and its replica through Item World</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-05 20:31:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>This may come off as a little early but seeing how our next trial lined up in the Chamber of the Indignant is [**Scorn of the Glacial Bird**](/gt) (assuming no swaps or delays), this might be a good time to run both Ragnarok and its replica through Item World. Weapon (1h Sword) | ATK | Special Effects ---|---|---| Ragnarok (Replica) | +104 ATK | +30% Ice Resist Ragnarok | +145 ATK | +50% Ice Resist +20% Magic Evade This item is obtainable once you clear [Alpherg](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Chamber_of_Arms_-_Alpherg) in the Chamber of Arms. First off, you'll need as close to [**380%**](/tg) combined resistance across ice/water/wind as possible to survive its shitty pre-amptive attack. Thereafter for the rest of the fight, you'll need [**200%**](/tg) combined ice/water/wind resist post-buffs. Most of the critical gears would go to your tanks, support and healers, leaving very little options left for your damage dealers unless you have somehow been farming ~20 Melodies of Life over the past few months. As a Zeno user, having an extra 50% ice resistance on a decent ATK weapon is a godsend. You don't lose much ATK while gaining some nice % of elemental protection. Secondly, you'll likely be using a magic tank in this trial and majority of them should be able to equip swords. This item definitely comes in handy if you lack elemental resistance TMRs. Hope this helps players who have already gotten the ideal stats on their main weapons and are looking for reasons to continue running IW or are in advanced preparation for this upcoming trial.</TEXT>

It provides information for the banners in JP to help you prep in advance for the units that you are looking to pull. I #8217;ve sorted them accordingly based on Story Event Units, KM Units, Raid Units and Summon Festival Units for ease of navigation. I #8217;m actively maintaining this thread to keep up with the latest banners in GL/JP. --- #Banner 1  #8211; FFV (1) [Light Warrior Krile](#I/Icons/u1472/) Light Warrior Krile (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+50% MAG  amp; 5% MP/Turn) [STMR](/#label-red): **Hat** (+100 MP, +32 DEF/SPR, +60 MAG  amp; 100% Para Resist) **Summary**: LW Krile is mainly a mix between evoke damage and magical chainer. She relies predominantly on casting her ability that chain with the tornado family up to max of 17.5x base modifier. Her CD ability allows her to consistently fill up 5 esper orbs across 4 turns and enables her to T-cast her abilities. Her evoke damage scales off 100 MAG/0 SPR but being non-elemental, it suffers from the lack of additional modifiers from elemental imperils and not to mention killer effects. That said, she does well against any enemy that is not resistant to non-elemental damage and can bypass any form of mitigation. All in all, she isn #8217;t a bad unit but there are better options out there. --- [Dark Mage Exdeath](#I/Icons/u1475/) Dark Mage Exdeath (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+6 DEF, +52 MAG, +10% MAG  amp; +30% Dark Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+60% MAG  amp; +50% Mag Dmg vs Man/Insect/Plant) **Summary**: DM Exdeath chains with the Chaos Wave family (surprising!) which covers wind/earth/dark up to a max base modifier of 15x. He has on-demand W/T-cast for his skillset and is able to unlock IV-cast through his CD skill. He has a multitude of innate different killers, making him exceptionally strong against specific enemies especially when combined with the killer nodes from Espers. His BiS is DW with both Rods and Swords. Gearing his head and body is a little troublesome though as he #8217;s unable to equip hats/robes. Thankfully with Sol #8217;s SE, there #8217;s a decent MAG helm that #8217;s available for him. --- [Dawn Warrior Galuf](#I/Icons/u1478/) Dawn Warrior Galuf (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Sword** (+130 ATK, +30 DEF, +20% HP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+40% HP/DEF, +50% Fire/Light Resist) **Summary**: The absolute jewel of this triple banner. Galuf is a monstrous tank that gives every other tank in the game a run for their money. His passives are INSANE with just his Trust Ability  #8211; [**80%**](/tg) passive draw, 140% HP, 190% DEF, 130% ATK, 60% SPR. He also comes with innate 80% fire/light resist, 10% evade and Guts, making him one heck of a tank. Having a sword for his TMR which unlocks his Trust Ability is utterly sensational  #8211; this means every other slot is literally free for any customization you may need. You can even build him as a full evade tank with 100% passive draw! To top it off, he chains with the Kingsglaive family and can **Entrust** for fuck #8217;s sake! UoC candidate? Hell yeah! --- Krile, Exdeath and Galuf were on a 25k/3 Laps banner with a guaranteed chance of getting any one of them on the last step. More info found [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9yqpta/jp_featured_banners_megathread_ffv_raid_11201130/) Do also check out /u/TomAto314 #8217;s [Table Fight  #8211; DW Galuf vs CG WoL](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/cekoiu/table_fight_dw_galuf_vs_cg_wol/) if you #8217;re planning to pull on this banner! --- #Banner 2  #8211; FFV (2) [(CG) Light Warrior Bartz](#I/Icons/u1481/) CG Bartz (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [LB Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNWRqzf2vpA/#label-yellow) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+40 ATK, +2 LB/Turn  amp; +50% TDW) [STMR](/#label-red): **1h Sword** (+167 ATK, Wind Element) **Summary**: CG Bartz is an TDW DPS unit with a mindblowing burst coming in hot at 128x modifier if you follow his [rotations here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/lwbartzrotation). Like Zeno and CG Lightning, he benefits from a 6x chain modifier through Dual Wield Mastery. His self-buffs and increment in certain damage modifiers are permanent and can only be removed through death. His gameplay is simple  #8211; spend the first 3 turns doing nothing but powering up and gradually increasing the modifiers of his chaining abilities before bursting the enemy hard. Bartz chains mainly with the AT family and has an uptime of 120% wind imperil in hit kit and is able to imbue himself with wind. If you do not wish to spend a turn imbuing wind, you can always get Atri #8217;s TMR, which is a wind-elemental sword and slap it on him. All in all, if you do not have Zeno, Bartz is your next go-to physical DD chainer for sure. --- [Light Warrior Lenna](#I/Icons/u1484/) Light Warrior Lenna (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+50% SPR, +100% Modifier to White Magic Restorative Spells (Cures/Regen)) [STMR](/#label-red): **Staff** (+60 ATK, +163 SPR, +30% SPR, Light Element  amp; Grant: Dispelga) **Summary**: Lenna is **the** white mage. Her kit mainly revolves around healing and LB fill which she excels at. Her TMR boosts the effects of heals to insane levels  #8211; reaching 20-25k heals with curaja if she has a decent amount of SPR. Her STMR also comes with a very powerful magic  #8211; Dispelga, something which Folka lacks in her kit. Lenna has T-white magic allowing her to triple reraise selective units. Need a full team reraise? No sweat. Her LB handles that. Heck, she can even Entrust! This makes her an ideal unit to pair with LB spammers like Esther or CG Chairman in the future. She has mitigations and can also provide protections against charm, stop and stat debuffs. Overall, she is just an amazing support unit. --- [Atri](#I/Icons/u1487/) Atri **TMR**: **1h Sword** (+125 ATK, Wind Element) **Summary**: TMR is perfect for Bartz if you are not someone who likes to imbue. --- [Tessen](#I/Icons/u1490/) Tessen **TMR**: **Materia** (+10% HP, +30% ATK w/ Clothes) **Summary**: To the trust coin exchange! --- Lenna and Bartz has 2 step up banners - a 3k/1 Lap banner and the usual 25k/3 Laps banner with a guaranteed chance of getting either of them on the last step of the 25k banner. More info found [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a1t4ts/jp_ffv_7_cg_lw_bartz_lw_lenna_banners_megathread/). If GL follows JP, this is one of those rare win-win banners. --- #Banner 3  #8211; ~~CG~~ Sol Story Event [Sol](#I/Icons/u1460/) Sol (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Robe** (+15 DEF, +65 MAG, +42 SPR, +10% MP) [STMR](/#label-red): **Accessory** (+70 MAG  amp; 30% Reduction to MP Costs) **Summary**: Sol is a tanky magic DPS unit. He chains with both CW and AR families and his LB also chains. He is also able to dual-wield rods which frees up the need for DW items like Genji glove or Quintessence, allowing you to pump in as much MAG as possible into his build. 10% physical/magical mitigation is a nice defensive trait and his trust ability provides him with innate charm/stop immunity along with 50% TDW magic. His STMR is similar to TT #8217;s except that it comes with a buttload of MAG on top of MP cost reduction  #8211; an absolute dream for an mage unit. Sol comes with on-demand W-cast and can unlock T/IV-cast through his other abilities. He has decently strong imperils and best works with a dupe for maximum damage. His main selling point is both his tankiness and high damage output, an especially rare combination for mages. --- [Heliak](#I/Icons/u1463/) Heliak **TMR**: **Helmet** (+40 DEF, +52 MAG) **Summary**: MAG Helmet is awesome for units like Golbez/Exdeath. --- [Eclipsa](#I/Icons/u1466/) Eclipsa **TMR**: **Materia** (Esper Stats +40%) **Summary**: TMR and off to the trust coin exchange! --- [Pelteira](#I/Icons/u1469/) Pelteria **TMR**: **Materia** (+40% ATK, -50% Poison/Confuse Resists) **Summary**: A self-imperil for status ailments? Nope. --- Sol was on both a 11k lapis step up banner in JP. Banner info [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9wc56l/jp_story_event_27_sol_banners_megathread_11121120/) For anyone who wants to start early prepping for Sol Story #8217;s Bonus Stage, these are the monsters #8217; information- [Extracted from JP megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9wc53h/jp_story_event_27_sol_event_megathread_11121120/) * 1st Wave: **Metal Gigantuar Lv 100** (Plant). Resistant to all debuffs. Kill it fast and move on. * 2nd Wave: **Ochu  amp; 3x Microchu** (Plant). Resistant to ATK/MAG debuffs and uses AoE confusion. Take out Ochu to disable its devastating Ochu Dance. * 3rd Wave: **White Dragon** (Dragon). Resistant to ATK/MAG debuffs. Best to nuke from 60% HP to avoid a potential wipe. --- #Upcoming Trials |No.|Chamber of Fallen|Chamber of Indignant (Scorn/Kai)| --:|:--|:--| |Due|[Shinryu](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a60u2z/jp_trial_shinryu_%E3%81%97%E3%82%93%E3%82%8A%E3%82%85%E3%81%86/)|[Glacial Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9kw851/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_glacial/)| |2|-|[Bloody Moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/9u2s6a/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bloody_moon/)| |3|-|[Elafikeras](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/a1emof/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_elafikeras/)| |4|-|[Aigaion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/afdtcj/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_aigaion_kai/)| |5||[Iron Giant](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/aq2re6/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_iron_giant/)| |6|-|[Bomb Family](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b0bhpv/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_bomb_family/)| |7|-|[Demon Wall](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bc9vk3/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_demon_wall/)| |8|-|[Tiamat](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/br3xu4/jp_guide_scorn_of_tiamat_trial/)| |9|-|[Great Malboro and Malboro Queen](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/by6vli/jp_trial_of_the_reborn_malboro_great_malboro/)| --- #Series Boss Battle (SBB) SBB is a new set of trials released together with a specific FF series.

This highlights all the upcoming ability awakening batches based on JP #8217;s update history. Looking back at GL #8217;s awakening update history, they have a tendency to not follow JP #8217;s order and instead prepare their own concoction.

A place where we have to **work extra hard** for time-limited rainbows! Looking ahead in JP, they seem to be doing re-runs for VP and SD with new added units. We are also due for another major collab which imo *should* technically be Octopath Traveler unless we have some other GLEX surprise installed (Parasite Eve maybe)?. ###Octopath Traveler Octopath Traveler is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Square Enix, in collaboration with Acquire, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released worldwide on July 13, 2018 and was collaborated with FFBE JP almost simultaneously. These are the units: [Primrose](#I/Icons/u1336/) Primrose (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Accessory** (+16 DEF, +40 SPR, +40% SPR, +100% Petrify Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Materia** (+30% MAG, +60% SPR  amp; 80% Chance Ignore up to 1 Fatal Attacks when HP above 40%) **Summary**: Primrose is like Soleil v10. She #8217;s is an insane buffer with 200% stat boosts in her LB along with AoE HP/MP heals over time and AoE LB fill. She comes with on-demand W-cast for her dances. Her regular dance moves provide 130% stat boosts and her CD ability comes with 40% damage mitigation that unlocks 160% stat boosts. She can even provide charm protection as a bonus. Her kit also includes killer boosts for Beasts/Dragons/Plants/Spirits, dark imbue (which can be W-cast) and dark imperil. The only thing she really lacks is an assortment of elemental resistance buffs. Other than that, she is a solid buffer for any team. --- [Olberic](#I/Icons/u1339/) Olberic (5 #9733;- 7 #9733;) [TMR](/#label): **Materia** (+40% HP, +20% DEF, +100% Paralyze Resist) [STMR](/#label-red): **Light Armor** (+1000 HP, +62 DEF, +55 SPR, +20% ATK/DEF) **Summary**: Olberic is a physical tank with innate provoke and 50% draw. His LB has a 40% damage mitigation. His CD unlocks a better cover ability with up to 80% damage reduction. As a plus, he can chain with the AR family which AoE debuffs by 80% wind/earth and he is capable of ST breaking for 60% value. His STMR has an insane 1,000 HP with decent DEF/SPR stats and a 20% DEF boost. Considering how we didn #8217;t get Gabranth whose STMR is a helmet with +1000 HP +18 ATK +81 DEF and +20% HP, this can be considered a great addition for anyone building up the ultimate beefy tank. --- [Therion](#I/Icons/u1342/) Therion **TMR**: **Accessory** (+12 ATK, +26 DEF, +30% Camouflage, +20% Physical Evade) **Summary**: TMR is excellent for dodge builds if you didn #8217;t farm Twenty-sided Die or don #8217;t have Ring of Lucii. --- [Tressa](#I/Icons/u1345/) Tressa **TMR**: **Materia** (+15% ATK/MAG, +25% EXP gained from battles) **Summary**: A good addition to EXP items for levelling units. --- Octopath Traveler had a ticket campaign where players would receive 1 Primrose/Olberic Ticket for every 10+1 summon done and can exchange for a Primrose/Olberic of choice with 5 ticket pieces. There was also a [**one-time**](/tg) 5,000 Lapis with a **guaranteed either Primrose/Olberic**. You don #8217;t get any Primrose/Olberic tickets for this one though. More info found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/90e4j8/jp_banner_octopath_traveler_collab_720_731/). --- #TomAto #8217;s Longshot Collab! For our August Veteran Rewards, we are proud to announce the new Anniversary Summon Coin Summon! For each 10+1 pull you have a chance of summoning Anniversary Coins III (gold colored), Anniversary Coins IV (gold colored) or Anniversary Coins VI (gold colored). Trade in 3 Anniversary Coins IV for an Anniversary Coin V (gold colored) which is equal to 2 Anniversary Coins VII (gold colored). *Please note that the trade in period for the coins are as followed:* * Anniversary Coins III - August 3rd * Anniversary Coins IV - September 3rd * Anniversary Coins V - July 3rd 2020 * Anniversary Coins VI - Eight fortnights from now * Anniversary Coins VII - The third Sunday after the next Blue Moon *Trade in items will be announced after our next big fuck up to placate you.* -courtesy of /u/TomAto314 --- #FFBE - War of the Visions This is the next big game that's coming soon^TM. It draws various aspects from FFBE and features a 3D tactical RPG gameplay system. WoTV already has a subreddit of its own found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wotv_ffbe/) if you're keen to follow closely on every latest update about it.  gt; This is the story of Ardora, a continent of Lapis. A tiny spark here ignites the flames that would embroil an entire continent in conflict. A continent later spoken of as the War of the Visions. A total of 5 nations engulfed in war with one another: [Leonis](/#label-red): Ruled by the Red Lion Monarch, possesses the power of Visions as well as twin princes. [Hourne](/#label-pink): The great western kingdom governed by a policy of peace and its wise king. [Fennes](/#label-green) Where the king of the savages has organized the barbarian tribes into Ardora's mightiest militant state. [Wezette](/#label): The great eastern kingdom, over which reigns its icy despot. [Crystal Sanctum](/#label-yellow) A religious city-state with believes throughout Ardora, founded by one who claims to be God.  gt; Each burdened with its own dignity, thus is the curtain drawn on a struggle in which the fate of nations rests. All is for One's Homeland... War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius is currently in development. --- ###Relevant Links: [**JP**](/tg) * [JP WoTV Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9i0kNsyMIY) * [JP WoTV Official Site](https://www.jp.square-enix.com/WOTV/) * [Pre-Registration](https://sqex-bridge.jp/preregister/546154334D67666B5A41434D3378366463494A6759673D3D0A/new) [**GL**](/gt): * [GL WoTV Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0LCdIi51Gs) * [GL WoTV Official Site](https://wotvffbe.com/) * [WorldWide Launch Reddit Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bz6hrr/war_of_the_visions_worldwide_launch_confirmed/) #Upcoming Hype  #8211; September 2019 |Banner 1|Units| :--|:--| |**FFVI**| [Magitek Warrior Terra](#I/Icons/u1517/)[Adventurer Locke](#I/Icons/u1520/)[Great Mage Kefka](#I/Icons/u1532/)[Assassin Shadow](#I/Icons/u1529/)| THE SHADOW META IS COMING SOON^TM! --- |Banner 2|Units| :--|:--| |**Physalis #8217;s Story Event**| [Physalis](#I/Icons/u1496/)[Juraga](#I/Icons/u1499/)[Gudon](#I/Icons/u1502/) --- # Conclusion That wraps it up for the upcoming month of August!

It draws various aspects from FFBE and features a 3D tactical RPG gameplay system.  gt; This is the story of Ardora, a continent of Lapis. A tiny spark here ignites the flames that would embroil an entire continent in conflict. A continent later spoken of as the War of the Visions. A total of 5 nations engulfed in war with one another: [Leonis](/#label-red): Ruled by the Red Lion Monarch, possesses the power of Visions as well as twin princes. [Hourne](/#label-pink): The great western kingdom governed by a policy of peace and its wise king. [Fennes](/#label-green) Where the king of the savages has organized the barbarian tribes into Ardora's mightiest militant state. [Wezette](/#label): The great eastern kingdom, over which reigns its icy despot. [Crystal Sanctum](/#label-yellow) A religious city-state with believes throughout Ardora, founded by one who claims to be God.  gt; Each burdened with its own dignity, thus is the curtain drawn on a struggle in which the fate of nations rests. All is for One's Homeland... War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius is currently in development. --- ###Relevant Links: [**JP**](/tg) * [JP WoTV Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9i0kNsyMIY) * [JP WoTV Official Site](https://www.jp.square-enix.com/WOTV/) * [Pre-Registration](https://sqex-bridge.jp/preregister/546154334D67666B5A41434D3378366463494A6759673D3D0A/new) * [Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj97dqIMaOU) [**GL**](/gt): * [GL WoTV Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0LCdIi51Gs) * [GL WoTV Official Site](https://wotvffbe.com/) * [WorldWide Launch Reddit Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bz6hrr/war_of_the_visions_worldwide_launch_confirmed/) WoTV already has a subreddit of its own and is found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wotv_ffbe/) --- # Conclusion That wraps it up for the upcoming month of September!

    <TEXT>I still like Akstar's design the most. Maybe because I've liked ronin characters all my life. Started with Rurouni Kenshin, then Onime no Kyo and it snowballed from there. Akstar: * Long white hair [x] * Kickass [x] * Dead serious/cold/aloof personality [x] * Badass [x] * One armed swordsman with eyepatch [x] Zeno may do more damage than Akstar, but Akstar definitely hits home for me.

    <TITLE>Chamber of Vengeful and GLEX units vs Future Banners</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-15 03:28:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure if this has been pointed out before but since the Chamber of Vengeful is now a permanent GLEX addition to the list of trials, expect a GLEX banner every month at least to couple with a "Vengeful" boss. GLEX banners | Chamber of Vengeful ---|---| Esther/Sylvie | Eggsterminator | CG Elena/Morgana | Empress Morgana | Tsukiko/Kaito | Obake Lantern | ###What does this mean? Hoard for GLEX units. Period. Or at least have some resources set aside for them. Some of them have made top of the list. Esther's banner featured 2 long shelf life units to date - Esther herself being a LB spamming bunny girl that has only recently been demoted half a point in rankings and Sylvie who is still an excellent support. CG Elena's banner featured GL's very first english voiced CG LB animated hybrid unit that's literally swarming all over the latest trials such as Scorn of the Wicked Moon. Morgana didn't last long however as she was displaced by Tsukiko and subsequently Kimono Fina. Tsukiko  gt; Kaito in their banner and she's one of the top 5 mages in GL's ranking. Kaito is sadly, disappointment. Lol. At this point, nobody is certain whether Summon Festival units will be a thing in GL as it was in JP but there will be at least some *other* GLEX banner that we can expect for sure apart from the SFest ones whose units can be UoCed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>GL Monthly Outlook - Oktober</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Welcome to another GL Monthly Outlook, the only thread that does not increase the price of lapis bundles! I #8217;ve adjusted my forecast tracker and did a more detailed overview of what #8217;s to come by sorting banners based on their event type. This makes things clearer and less smeared. Don #8217;t forget that we are getting occasional GLEX banners which we have absolutely zero foresight on.

I #8217;ve sorted them accordingly based on Story Event Units, KM Units, Raid Units and Summon Festival Units for ease of navigation. I #8217;m actively maintaining this list to keep up with the latest banners in GL/JP. From the previous GL Monthly Outlook, I #8217;ve realized that cross posting this here results in an absolute cluster fuck so it #8217;s back to the [usual link]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bj924w/gl_upcoming_banners_compilation_list/)! --- # Conclusion [**We are dangerously approaching the advent of the Summon Festivals.**](/gt) Will Gumi proceed with what JP did and make certain units non-UoCable and locking them behind tickets/lapis? No one knows. Stay tuned to find out! That wraps it up for the upcoming month of October! See ya next month! Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>FFBE GL - What DO the Players Expect?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-25 17:29:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>When it comes to the Final Fantasy franchise, we are looking at several specific categories of players, most of whom love a particular series for **nostalgia** - having played it when they were kids on now old and outdated electronic devices. Nostalgic feelings in reliving all possible emotions associated with playing said series  #8211; frustration, anger, sadness, happiness, joy, comfort, confusion, longing etc, mostly with strong character attachments  #8211; like how Aerith x Sephiroth was a momentous scene that 99.99% of the FF players remember to date or how the original FFX story ended. This forms the first category of players  #8211; loving the game for what it is. These players really don #8217;t expect much  #8211; they just want justice done to their favorite characters when ported over to FFBE as a gacha unit. These players will pull for **only** their favorite units under absolutely **any** circumstances and subsequently use them to play through the FFBE story or to clear trials and events. For Gumi, this isn #8217;t all THAT bad because they WILL get **some form of sales** one way or another as long as they continue cranking out units from the FF franchise. --- Next, we have the META players. Now this lot of players are sub divided further into 2 categories  #8211; the first (Pure Meta) totally ditches the need for nostalgia and only seek to be the strongest - aka the  #8220;I wanna be the very best that no one ever was #8221; group and the other (Semi Meta/Nostalgia) that strikes a balance between owning the latest unit while preserving *some form* of nostalgia. --- The Pure Meta players are straight forward  #8211; they seek absolute and utter domination over the game and unsurprisingly, will whale out to meet that need. You can even say that these players form the top percentile of the game, owning multiple fully decked out units clad in STMRs with eye popping ePeen and damage. Once they lock onto a unit, they won #8217;t stop until they satisfy that need of dominance- whether it is FFBE, FF series, Collaboration or Time limited units. Easy peasy. This is Gumi #8217;s golden goose. They **know** that these lot of players WILL spend to get what they want even though the banner rates or summon system is abysmal. --- Now comes the Semi-Meta/Nostalgia group which unfortunately, in FFBE, is one of, if not **THE** most difficult to satisfy. They want **THEIR FAVORITE** unit to be the latest and most powerful while clinging on to some nostalgia and will go bonkers if this balance isn #8217;t met. These players can sometimes be hyper-bipolar when it comes to banner/unit reveals. They either go into a berserker rage or orgasmic ecstasy to finally see their favorite unit being shat on or featured as the cream of the crop, respectively. Do it wrong and the entire lot of them will join forces as one and rage continuously  #8211; giving moderators like /u/Nazta one hell of a day(s) to shut down multiple repeated posts - extensive rants on how JP units differ from GL because they are *toned down for balance* are the staple or how JP #8217;s system is better than GL or why GL isn #8217;t getting this or that etc. Sometimes the rage even goes on way beyond after the banner has ended, although rarely because these group would probably have found something else to piss on. On the contrary, do it correctly and Gumi is looking at one heck of a spike in sales for the month. White Knights appear outta nowhere and praise Gumi for their generosity and tack, even pledging their allegiance to support the game until it dies if they continue their good work only to be disappointed with dreams often crushed (usually) one week later on news day. --- In the end, there is no one singular entity community with ONE demand or like what /u/M33tm3onmars said [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/d928sa/jp_niconico_live_42_925/f1etloy/):  gt; there *isn #8217;t* a unified voice on what the players want unilaterally Everyone has their own form of expectations in FFBE - even /u/TomAto314 has already lowered his and is stewing in post depression almost every other week. I #8217;m honestly surprised he's held up this long and hasn't checked in for professional help at this point. --- What I've said above forms barely a part of an intricate breakdown of what player wants. They can want anything and I mean **literally** anything - better drop rate for crystals, higher GIL cap, removing damage cap, revamp of old systems, transparency etc. This is afterall FFBE. A gacha game that intends to last a good 50 years into the future so it is utterly imperative that Gumi knows the players #8217; expectations. So, what **DO** you want?</TEXT>

For one, I would want her to have her main chaining skills (YSD/TCB) available without unlock.</TEXT>

I just had to re-apply the thunder imbue. * Myra's Fighting! elementally chains with Sakura's Quick Shock Blade after I equipped her with a Lightning weapon. Cid basically capped the chain. * Fid's Beach House Break upgraded Summer Sun to Ultra Summer Sun for that juicy 100% lightning imperil. * I did not bother to dispel Anima's defensive buff just to see if Cid can stomp through her defenses.... and he did not disappoint.</TEXT>

A banner re-run seems pretty likely. HOWEVER, if they do decide on a last min B2B Raid, it should be none other than FFV ft DM Exdeath/DW Galuf/LW Krile. | - | Re-run KM event | Goes hand in hand with banner re-run</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advent of Summon Festival - Who's included? Will there not be one in GL?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 21:45:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>As most of you are aware, this month's Story Event *should* be Physalis's; which means that next month, we're *most likely* getting [(CG) White Lily Dark Fina](https://youtu.be/xZ2AQsZYG_g)'s SE  amp; banner; assuming Gumi doesn't delay with some other GLEX^TM unit or follows JP with [Hyoh's SE re-run + ability awakening](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ae4h1z/jp_maintenance_hyoh_story_event_rerun/). In JP, her banner signals the start of what is known as Summon Festivals, basically a fancy name given to time-limited banners featuring FFBE and the FF franchise's main protagonists, where the on-banner unit(s) **cannot be UoC-ed** and can only be obtained via step-up and regular ticket pulls or when the banner makes a comeback. You also get to pull from a reduced pool of rainbows with certain excluded units and a 5% rainbow rate. Based on JP's data, I've already assembled a table listing out SF units [since April](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bj924w/gl_upcoming_banners_compilation_list/) with their respective banner info for referencing: |Banner Featured 5 #9733; Unit|5 #9733;Unit Name|Step Up/max Laps|Guaranteed **Featured** 5 #9733;?|Special Ticket Exchange|No. of Special Tickets Obtainable|JP Link| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |[CG Majin Fina](#I/Icons/u1541/)|CG Dark Fina|25k/1 Lap|Yes|No|-|[S.Fest #1](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/apqwgi/jp_summon_festival_vday_banners_megathread_212228/)| |[CG Aldore King Rain](#I/Icons/u1559/)|CG AK Rain|25k/1 Lap|Yes|No|-|[S.Fest #2](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/azqbpl/jp_summon_festival_2_banners_megathread_311320/)| |[CG Onion Knight](#I/Icons/u1577/)|CG Onion Knight|3k/1 Lap + 25k/3 Laps|Yes (Onion Knight on 25k)|5x Ticket of Choice|1x from 3k/ 3x from 25k|[S.Fest #3](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b7p2wz/jp_ffiii_cg_ok_fest_banners_megathread_41414/)| |[CG King Lasswell](#I/Icons/u1586/)|CG HK Lasswell|25k/1 Lap|Yes|No|-|[S.Fest #4](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bbj2tz/jp_summon_festival_4_lasswell_banners_megathread/)| |[CG Prince Noctis](#I/Icons/u1604/)[CG Aldore King Rain](#I/Icons/u1559/)|CG Prince Noctis/CG AK Rain|25k/5 Laps|Yes (Either)|5x Ticket of Choice for Either|2x/Lap|[S.Fest #5](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bj44vd/jp_ffxv_cg_noctis_banners_megathread_51514/)| |[CG Majin Fina](#I/Icons/u1541/)[Lunafreya](#I/Icons/u1610/)|Lunafreya/CG Dark Fina|24.5k/3 Laps|No|No|-|[S.Fest #6](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bkipvk/jp_lunafreya_cg_dark_fina_fest_ffxv_bonus_update/)| |[Madam Edel](#I/Icons/u1619/)|Madam Edel|26.5k/1 Lap|Yes  amp; 1x from Bundle|No|-|[S.Fest #7](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bmvhw6/jp_summon_festival_madam_banners_megathread_510520/)| |[Paladin Cecil](#I/Icons/u1642/)[Palom  amp; Porom](#I/Icons/u1645/)|CG Paladin Cecil, Palom  amp; Porom|25k/3 Laps|Yes|5x Ticket of Choice|2x/Lap|[S.Fest #8](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bv8i3s/jp_ffiv_cg_cecil_banners_megathread_61610/)| |[CG Zidane](#I/Icons/u1675/)|CG Zidane|25k/5 Laps|Yes (1 of 3)|5x Ticket of Choice|2x/Lap|[S.Fest #9](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/c7nj4a/jp_ffix_cg_zidane_banners_megathread_71714/)| |[Sakura of the Delta Star](#I/Icons/u1693/)[Nichol of the Epsilon Star](#I/Icons/u1696/)|Sakura of the Delta Star/Nichol of the Epsilon Star|25k/5 Laps|Yes (Either)|25x Special Box Ticket|5x/Lap|[S.Fest #10](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/cc7xts/jp_story_event_34_sakuranichol_banners_megathread/)| |[CG Tidus](#I/Icons/u1717/)[Yunalesca](#I/Icons/u1720/)|CG Tidus/Yunalesca|25k/5 Laps|Yes (Either)|5x Ticket of Choice|2x/Lap|[S.Fest #11](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ck9n26/jp_ffx_cg_tidus_banners_megathread_81812/)| |[Yuna X-2](#I/Icons/u1741/)[Rikku X-2](#I/Icons/u1744/)[Paine](#I/Icons/u1747/)|Yuna X-2/Rikku X-2/Paine|19.5k/5 Laps|Yes (1 of 3)|No|-|[S.Fest #12](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/cpxayy/jp_ffx2_banners_megathread_813822/)| |[CG Shantotto](#I/Icons/u1789/)|CG Shantotto|25k/10 Laps|Yes (Either)|5x Ticket of Choice|2x/Lap|[S.Fest #13](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/d6ud9r/jp_ffxi_cg_shantotto_banners_megathread_921930/)| |[Ifrit Rain](#I/Icons/u1801/) [Bahamut Fina](#I/Icons/u1804/)[Diabolos Sol](#I/Icons/u1807/) [Asura Akstar](#I/Icons/u1810/)|CG Ifrit Rain/Bahamut Fina/Diabolos Sol/Asura Akstar|4k/Regular 10+1|Yes (Random/Guaranteed)|10x Ticket for Random/30x Ticket for Choice|1x/10+1|[S.Fest #14](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dbdpwm/jp_4th_anni_esper_units_more_banners_megathread/)| Before some of you freak the fuck out, did you notice how the UoC interface in GL has been changed to include ticket count? To the optimists, this may mean that Gumi *may not* go ahead with the Summon Festival system and the above units will be available for exchange albeit at a higher UoC ticket cost. To the pessimists, this may just be a meaningless visual update with no impact whatsoever and the Summon Festival might still be a thing. Knowing Gumi, we may even wind up getting a separate GLEX^TM system altogether with a **new type** of "UoC ticket" specifically for the SF units that can only be obtained through some notoriou$ means. [Also, please don't forget that they can swap the order of these banners at will](/tg) or introduce some GLEX^TM unit that may potentially powercreep the above units right after their banner ends. That is all.</TEXT>

We've been getting a slew of mages lately and I've got another *hunch* that we're getting a GLEX unit soon^TM. Probably someone good for Halloween. Again, I could be wrong.

    <TITLE>Demon Matsuri ft TDW Fire Veritas</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-24 23:20:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>(LGD) 2/3 Missions: https://youtu.be/6FF6SmEy_mk Team Used: Unit | Role ---|---| [Fire Veritas](#I/Icons/u575/) | Finisher, TDW build with Water Axe, Diabolos Esper, Demon Killer [Summer Fina  amp; Lid 2018](#I/Icons/u1361/) | Breaker/Imbue Water Splash [CG Folka](#I/Icons/u1207/) | Healer/Ailment Protection - specifically Petrification [Wilhelm](#I/Icons/u469/) | Full Evade Cover/Provoke with fire weapon to "liberate mobs". [CG Fina](#I/Icons/u815/) | Healer/Reraiser [CG Charlotte](#I/Icons/u1422/) | Magic Cover Tank, Mitigation buffer, friend unit. **Key Notes regarding [Fire Veritas](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Veritas_of_the_Flame)** * Firstly, I chose Fire Veritas. Why? Because he **fucking absorbs** fire damage. Bet most of you forgot about him didn't ya? * Second of all, I made him TDW. Because if Cid can do it, so can he! * Third, it gives me a chance to finally use that damn water axe from Mercedes I got ages ago. What was it again? [Viking Axe](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Viking_Axe)? HELLYEAH! Fire Veritas's a fucking Viking alright! * Fourth, fuck all of you Elena users, bunch of GLEX whores and whimps! * Fifth, I love finishers. Period. And even more so, **MANLY FINISHERS**. --- **Notes on actual battle** * Everyone aside from Fire Veritas must have at least 100% fire resist. * I didn't bother with "doing as much damage to the boss before sealing" as suggested. Fuck that shit. Just camp out for 5 Sealing Shards, Seal, watch as half of Tsukumogami's health gets ripped in half, camp for another 5 Shards, Seal, and watch it disappear like every other Oni in animes. * Fid's kit fits **perfectly** in here. All of the summons are naturally weak to water. She imparts Water Splash to *everyone* and can turn any of my unit in to a pseudo chainer. It's all a matter of role dedication and assignment. * The more mobs Tsukumogami summons, the more LB crystals my team can generate; especially with Wilhelm's and Charlotte's high counter rate, allowing me to maintain full uptime on whichever LB I need. This is especially crucial post 50% HP when you get a fucking paper lantern festival handed to your face outta nowhere. Fina and Fid spamming their LBs post 50% while you extinguish those lanterns one by one with Fire Veritas after Tsukumogami dies is truly one of the best feelings ever. Trust me. * Fire Veritas, the man of the hour. Never regretted enhancing him. Heavy Stomp  gt; Power Stomp. Then use Full Charge Stomp whenever it's available. TDW means 2 hits. With Diabolos and Demon Killer coupled with Fid's breaks applied, Sealing Shards shatter and paper lanterns extinguish. Gearing a water axe means that *if he should die by any chance*, I don't have to reimbue him with water. --- That's about it. One of **the best fights** I've ever had in a while. I'll put up my Fire Veritas in my companion list should you require his aid. Best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears?* Units with unlockable abilities. Units like Ignis have a great kit, but its locked behind the need to unlock them through an ability. He will *almost always* fall short to units w/o unlockable abilities like MS Nichol. Even with enhancements, he **still** has to use Cooking to access the rest of his skills. I know Gumi's keeping it close to his lore but still... It just doesn't make sense for units in this era to have "unlockable abilities" or use X to unlock Y use Y to unlock Z.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-05 21:18:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Totally not a QoL post. Looking at Ignis, I have a suggestion for other units with unlockable abilities like Kryla for instance: [Suggestion](/#label): Add a number counter next to an unlocked ability. [Description](/#label-yellow): This allows the players to actually keep track of how many more turns an ability can be used until it has to be re-unlocked. I know Ignis probably won't be used as often as Nichol or Sylvie but hey, this helps the few lot of us who're actually using him in battle and it could potentially prove useful if Gumi decides to add more units with unlockable abilities going forward.</TEXT>

What gives? Akstar is using a TWO handed weapon even though he has only one hand ffs! Is it not honorable for a light saber to be wielded in a 2-handed manner?

    <TITLE>Prognosticator 411: Why we are getting AK Rain so early</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-08 17:57:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was giving some thought as to why AK Rain was pushed out so early and a few things came to mind: * **Ease of Trials**: Shinryu has been delayed and the next Scorn is that of the dreaded Machina - Aigaion. We also know Gumi has the tendency to push out units in tandem with trials so it won't come as a surprise if they decide to release AK Rain so early to help us out with clearing these. * **Magic DPS Units Rework**: This is mostly influenced by /u/jonidschultz's [Tinfoil Tea Hour](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBEblog/comments/dt5hkn/tinfoil_tea_hour/) suggesting that mages are getting some personal me-time with the Units Department. * **Personal Vendetta**: They've declared war against my monthly series and just aim to screw me over in front of everyone. Pretty ludicrous if you ask me lol. * **4th Quarter Sales Target**: Release a known "powerhouse" only to powercreep it later GLEX^TM style to reach that end of year $ales target. * **Hess King Lasswell is next**: This is a longshot but could it be that they're sticking to the well known "Bros before Hoes?". Why else would the [poster for NYC Livestream](https://sc-schemes.s3.amazonaws.com/28177/header_image.jpg) feature AK Rain and ~~Free~~ HK Lasswell back to back? That is all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't **really** need the Fist because 2h GS has a better output than the fist but I'm definitely looking forward to doing this trial. Went through several video tactics and I found 2 that I can probably reference to: * [Kugel's Clear with 2x Regina, SS Charlotte, Fid, Foltra, Sieghard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSG1wRbbOlQ) * [ #12362; #12387; #12385; #12419; #12435;'s Clear with 2x AK Rains, Elephim, Olberic, LW Lenna, SS Charlotte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNAyCjv8EQU amp;t=209s) Looking back at my past attempts with Kugel's strat, I failed half the time lol so I might have to come up with a strat of my own with IKEA Rains instead lol.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-14 23:39:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>TINFOIL HAT TIME! Let's see: Unit | Precursor Element ---|---| Esther | Storm (Thunder) Kaito | Sea (Water) Elena | Aurora (Light) Karten | Shadow (Dark) We have a total of 8 elements. This leaves us with Fire, Ice, Wind and Earth. I can foresee us getting the Precursor of **Blizzard** next month for Winter GLEX units. Fire (Inferno?) Precursor might come during the CNY event in February. Wind (Heavens?) and Earth (Mountain?) Precursors perhaps to debut in Spring next year? And we also have: Unit | Time Keeper# ---|---| Tsukiko | 2nd Godrea | 7th Christine | Last Just how many time keepers are there!? So what happens when all the Precursors and Time Keepers have been *assembled*? Will there be a end-game boss specifically for this GLEX^TM Lore? Will we be able to fuse Precursors or Time Keepers together to get a brand new ~~Captain Planet~~ unit?! Should I include this in my monthly series!?</TEXT>

Also really glad that we're finally getting World Reset ala GLEX^TM. Was on the verge of giving up! Now for this week's stuff- it might very well be a dead week *but* there's also that small chance Gumi might throw in another Raid event for funsies. We're also overdue for Kefka's SBB and Shinryu. Other than these two, I don't foresee anything else happening. If there isn't a old KM banner re-run, we can safely use our NRG to farm up crystals for ability awakenings and for the KM EP/ UoC Rewards. That's all for now. Have a great week ahead!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Real Talk: Units I regretted using resources on</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-18 20:10:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll be upfront and honest here, ever since we've gotten IKEA Rain, I've been looking back at the banners that I pulled on and the units that I've UoC-ed (list shown below) and weighing what *could have been* salvaged had I not made such poor decisions. Looking back, this was my pull history with Lapis: Unit Banner | Month | Outcome ---|---|---| Hyoh | September 2018 | Complete step-up. 4x Hyohs. Got another 2x as off rainbows to date. **Ignis** | October 2018 | Incomplete step-up. 15k Lapis wasted. Zero Ignis. ( #9583; #176; #9633; #176;) #9583; #65077;  #9531; #9473; #9531; Pulled 2x as off rainbows to date. Citra | October 2018 | Incomplete step-up. 2x Citras. Pulled another 4x as off rainbows to date. 2B /A2 | November 2018 | Incomplete step-up. 10k lapis. Pulled 1x 2B. Used trust coins to get her prism for her 7 #9733;. Sieghard | December 2018 | Incomplete step-up. 1x Sieghard. Still only 1 copy **to date** Folka | January | Completed step-up 2x Folka. Pulled another 1x as off rainbow to date. Ignacio | February | Completed step-up. Only 1x Ignacio. Still at 1 copy **to date**. Cid | March | Completed step-up. 4 Cids. Pulled 2x as off rainbows to date. Akstar/Zeno | May | Incomplete step-up. Failed to get Zeno. Somehow got 4 Akstars with 10k Lapis. UoC-ed 2x Zenos. Got another Akstar as off-rainbow to date. Summer Fina  amp; Lid | May | Incomplete step-up. Failed to get any. 15k Lapis wasted. UoC-ed 2x Fids. **Regina** | June | Incomplete step-up. Failed to get any. 10k Lapis wasted. UoC-ed 2x Reginas. **Aerith/Red XIII** | June | Incomplete step-up. 2x Red XIII. No Aerith. Landed 2x Aerith as off-banner rainbows and another Red XIII to date. SS Charlotte | July | Did special 5+1 summon for her. Ended up with 2x copies on first try Radiant Lightning/Neverending Hope | July | Incomplete step-up. 1x Neverending Hope on 1st step. Prism moogled RLightning's TMR via KM shop. LW Bartz | August | Incomplete step-up. 1x LW Bartz on 1st step. Prism moogled another of his TMR via KM shop **Sol** | September | Did several 2k lapis pulls. Failed. No Sol. ( #9583; #176; #9633; #176;) #9583; #65077;  #9531; #9473; #9531; Aldore King Rain | November | Did special 9+1+1 summon. 10k Lapis with 2x AK Rains. --- Poor choices in bold with deliberation: **Ignis Banner** I wanted to prep for upcoming finishers and thought I *needed* units that I could imbue. After recovering from Hyoh's full out pull, I was left with approximately 9k Lapis at that point and wasted it on Ignis banner. Had I known I was going to UoC Fid ~8 months down the road, I wouldn't have pulled. Possible resource salvaged: ~9,000 Lapis, Handful of tickets. --- **Regina Banner** Yes. You saw that right. REGINA. The one fuck of an android that I was getting all hyped about due to big damage and stuff. RNG was gracious with Cid but I **had to** go for another finisher in hopes of trivializing certain trials due to her super 1st turn damage and crazily backloaded LB. Trials that I *thought I could clear* with Regina: Lich/Glacial Bird/Neo Exdeath/Emperor/Kefka. None of them were cleared by her! Fast forward to the present when we recently got Emperor SBB- I even went ahead and used my one and only 100% STMR moogle on **NG Jake** thinking that I could defeat Emperor with his gun and running it through IW. Man was I wrong.. The unit that helped me with an initial clear was eShadowlord.. And subsequently IKEA Rain who clutched the fight in under 25 turns for that sweet 1,000 Lapis. She got [her enhancements in JP recently](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dtqcrz/jp_maintenance_story_event_elena_morgana_iw_enh/) and it's worth nuts. Honestly with units like FFVIIAC Cloud around, she absolutely pales in comparison. Worst. Decision. Biggest. Regret. Ever. Period. And the fact that they brought AK Rain forward rubbed the entire dead sea into my wound. Fuck! Possible resource salvage: ~8,000 Lapis, 2x UoCs, 100% STMR moogle, Handful of tickets. --- **Aerith/Red XIII Banner** Thought I needed a healer upgrade from Folka but turns out I didn't. Still using her enhanced form to date. Went in with whatever lapis/tickets I had in hopes of getting her but walked away with Red XIII instead. Subsequently got 2 of her as off-rainbows and I ain't even mad. Poor choice but RNG was kind later on. Not a real regret but just poor luck and choice on my part. Possible resource salvaged: ~5000 Lapis, Some tickets. --- **Sol Banner** Not sure why I even pulled on his banner. I don't use mages and I don't even any recent good ones on my team! No Tsukiko/ Kimono Fina/ Circe/ Christine/ Neo Exdeath. Best mage I had based on Furcula's sheet? BS Sakura / Mediena. Heck, I even planned on skipping Bloody Moon Kai! Wtf was I thinking? Dammit! Possible resource salvaged: ~4k Lapis, Some tickets. --- What was your worst choice for banners?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears?* DQXI. For the love of god, how many times are they gonna collab with this game? For one, I honestly detest the sprite designs let alone the unit's kit. I know it's somewhat a cash grab for SQEX or it's a gimmick to increase the already popular DQ but seriously? Judge me all you want but for the record, I've **converted all DQ units into Trust Coins** including 5 #9733; based ones. Yes, that is how much I hate it - removed all traces of them from my unit inventory. --- Based on FFBE Gamepedia's [Update Schedule](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Update_Schedule): Date | DQ Event ---|---| Apr 2018 | DQ KM Event: Dragonlord / Killing Machine / Golem / Orochi / Liquid Metal Slime / Robbin' 'Ood / Slime Sep 2018 | DQ KM Event **Re-run** Sep 2018 | DQ Raid Event : Estark / Marquis de /  #220;berkilling Machine / Slime Knight/ Dracky Sep 2019 | DQXIS KM Event: Mordegon / Great Dragon/ Eleven / Veronica/ Serena Nov 2019 | DQXIS Raid Event: The Lord of Shadows/ Japser Unbound / Erik / Rab/ Jade/ Sylvando **Five**. We've had it 5 times across a span of 1.5 years. What other collabs do we know of thats been done so many times in GL? None! Collab (Sorted Alphabetically) | Count ---|---| Deus EX: Mankind Divided | 1x (Aug 2018) Just Cause 3 | 1x (Jun 2018) Kingdom Hearts | 2x (Jan  amp; Sep 2019) NIER | 2x (Aug 2017  amp; Nov 2018) Octopath Traveler | 1x (Aug 2019) Secret of Mana | 2x (Jan 2017  amp; Jun 2019) Tomb Raider | 1x (Mar 2018) Valkyrie Profile | 1x (Oct 2018) --- For the upcoming DQ Raid this thursday, I'll raid just to get the milestone rewards and that's it. Will probably stop at 10% moogle or the last 4 #9733; ticket available depending on my mood. Fuck! I've had it with this shit! ( #9583; #176; #9633; #176;) #9583; #65077;  #9531; #9473; #9531;</TEXT>

Blasphemy! I'm just posting this to keep things consistent. If this week's banner is "Black Friday", shouldn't the banner that's coming on 12/2 be "Cyber Monday"? Also, Thanksgiving's this week. Hope everyone's in the midst of defrosting their turkeys; if you're using one that is.. Stuff yourselves, gain over 20 pounds, look in the mirror, make false new year resolutions and repeat you glorious fat bastards! **Bonus**: Forecast for the main sub over the next few days until maintenance - IS MM XON/AGT OLIVE GOOD!?

    <TEXT>If the main sub [has one](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/e1y2o6/sbb_kefka_friend_request_thread/), we should too! According to the [wiki](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/SBB:_Kefka), Kefka has 2025 DEF, human race (although he's actually in "god" form pfft) and is immune to DEF/SPR breaks but vulnerable to ATK/MAG breaks. So with that in mind, I'm setting up my AK Rain maximizing human killer/LB damage. Build found [here](https://i.imgur.com/peZBLsY.png).

    <DATE>2019-11-30 04:08:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am highly tempted to. But seeing what's coming, I might actually hold back. I need a tank and Sieghard obviously don't think I'm beautiful enough. It's either CG WoL or Lucas (GLEX^TM Xmas Mecha Tank) at this point. Also, seeing how Gumi's actually bringing foward certain FF series, it won't be a surprise if they drop FFVII AC randomly and I want to be prepped for AC Cloud even if they have to ~~nerf~~ balance his numbers first then rebalance them later.</TEXT>

At the rate we're going, this boss will be dead on arrival lol. --- [11R rainbow pull was fantastic](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBEblog/comments/e4vym8/first_blood_heres_my_11r_pull/). Gotten STMRs for Charlotte and Olive and 2x 50% moogles from 3rd copies of Ignis and Aerith. Funny how the game *knows* that my mage department is short-staffed: * 5 #9733; EX ticket on Friday nabbed me Operative Zyrus? Damn.. * 11R: I've always wanted Sol as a collection unit ever since his SE and I'm now contented. * 11R: Defeated Kefka SBB and got DM Kefka unit? Sure! * 11R: 2nd copy of Circe? Why not? * 11R: 1st Livid Shantotto? Uhh.. Okay.. Is the reflect tactic still viable? Bonus: 11R: 1st Esther! For real!? After all those dialogues I've inserted into my monthly outlooks and she finally decided to show up? And **of course** she drops when I've *already* prism-ed her TMR wayyy back then for Regina... **inhales** *You know what grinds my gears....?*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original comment link redacted. JP Folk 1's epic comment:  gt; 1. I was perfectly happy with summon fest in JP. In fact I'd rather summon fest than having to pull a unit to then pick their prism. Also I was really looking forward for Locke's STMR among others which just cost 40 UoCs in JP.  gt; 2. GL is pure shit, absolutely nothing redeeming in this "version" of the game... oh wait, there are the popstar collabs, well that's the only good thing in GL  gt; 3. Expert Missions and World Reset are way better than stupid "no summon fest" shit, with those resources I'd summon fest my way through the game happy and jolly  gt; 4. GL shouldn't even exist, I play both, in fact I do also play chinese and GL is the worst of the three by far, far as in multiverses of distance (considering each universe in its full length) JP Folk 2's milder comment:  gt; **JP Players**  gt; Laughs in all prisms and Ultimania Man...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grinds my Gears: Unit Ratings</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-06 21:39:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears?* Unit Ratings and the over-emphasis on them. I see unit ratings as a "guideline" for newbies who just picked up the game and want a rough idea of who's good and who's not. That's what I would do if I started FFBE today or any other game that primarily runs on owning a set of heroes/units/characters - so that I know what I need to be on a look out for and which are the ones I can ditch and that's about it. For a vet who's already savvy with the game, I don't care who's 10/10 or who's 7/10 or which unit is ranked 20.5 or 21 or who dropped by .5 because some folks came to an agreement after thorough discussion and decided that their knowledge was sufficient to act as the basis for promotion/demotion of units. Instead, I look at what the unit does, and what potential or additional benefits it brings for my team and whether it's companion-friendly. I don't want something meagre that hardly/barely raises my team's performance. If I can clear trials comfortably, it's all good. When I start feeling the heat, that's when I know I need an upgrade - example from Zeno to AK Rain. Upgrading to AK Rain from Zeno for me meant having more damage, AoE coverage, a fuss-free simpler rotation and more friends to chain with. I don't care if a time-limited collab arrives a week later and supersedes him by .5 score. If switching over meant having to *re-find* friends, spend unnecessary resources and losing my edge in AoE coverage, then fuck it. I'm staying with what I have. It's all about **Relevance** (to me anyway). That is all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Weekly News Prediction - December Week 2</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Week | News | Explanation ---|---|---| 2 | Week 2 SE | The usual -| KM Event | Makes perfect sense since the [special 5 #9733; guaranteed summon](https://lapis-prod-staticnews-gumi-sg.akamaized.net/prod//en/content/20191201GuaranteedSummonTicket.html) and [UoC ticket](https://lapis-prod-staticnews-gumi-sg.akamaized.net/prod//en/content/20191201FreeSelectSummonTicket.html) aligns on this date (damn now I sound like one of those astronomers. Or was it astrologists..? ) - | Shinryu | - - | Scorn of Iron Giant | Next in line --- Now for the KM event, we *should* get CG WoL this week. BUT, remember that we are getting Lucas (Tank) /Levinson (Hybrid DD) for Xmas event. 2 Tank banners in a month sounds pretty generous to me. In which case, the next possible KM may be CG OK's or even CG Prince Noctis's. Who knows? We'll find out soon I suppose. **Bonus**: Expect FMA Raid event soon^TM. Seeing how they brought forward DQXI, I wouldn't be surprised if FMA got brought over this early.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grinds my Gears: Item World</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 00:21:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears?* Item World. I'm sure this is all very relatable and I believe many of you would have probably experienced what I have. Triple 1% stats on Floor 10. Really? I find it absolutely frustrating that as the floor gets higher, the odds of you rolling shit stats increases. I mean seriously? God forbid getting a *relevant* stat while I'm at it - rolling MAG% on an ATK weapon or ATK% on a MAG weapon. 10 rounds of absolute horse shit and what's the best reward from IW to make up for it? A 4 #9733; ticket and a 10% moogle. That's it. Nothing else. I know we get this every month and we have many opportunities to grind an item up to expectations but nothing's worse than coming home, laying back, relaxing and wanting to farm up some IW for the 2 fresh oven baked STMRs I've got today only to get abysmal rolls while I'm at it. Oh and the best part? The assigned party disappears every fucking month. Doesn't matter if you set up Akstar x PG Lasswell to chain. It always resets to S1 Rain and Lasswell. Thank god for saved parties. I would have lost my shit if I had to re-gear a team of 3 every damn time I'm enhancing items. That is all, lali.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grind my Gears: The TYPE of Step-Up on FFXV Banner that maybe applied for future FF series</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 17:23:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears*? The TYPE of Step Up's reception on FFXV Banner that may herald how future FF banners will be introduced. First things first - the banner itself (incoming self-reassurance 101) I know the rate's horrible and many, myself included, were expecting the usual 25k/lap banner where you can get either Noctis/Lunafreya on the last step. But come as it may, I think it isn't as bad when you look at what JP got that made a whole lot of players quit on Lunafreya's banner. --- **Take 1**: JP's introduction of the FFXV units was worse. |-|JP|GL| :--|:--|:--| |Banner|[Lunafreya x CG Dark Fina](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bkipvk/jp_lunafreya_cg_dark_fina_fest_ffxv_bonus_update/)|[CG Noctis x Lunafreya](https://lapis-prod-staticnews-gumi-sg.akamaized.net/prod//en/img/20191210PrinceNoctisFeaturedSummon.jpg)| |-|[CG Noctis x AK Rain](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bj44vd/jp_ffxv_cg_noctis_banners_megathread_51514/)|-| CG Noctis **together** on a banner with AK Rain and Lunafreya **together** with CG Dark Fina. Nobody likes split banners. And to match them with 2 of FFBE's most prominent characters when they already had their individual banners some time ago? Insane. Not to mention that they **only** announced the coming of the prince in their livestream and the sudden Lunafreya bomb was dropped 3 days right after the prince's banner. Rage quit? Of course! --- **Take 2**: It *isn't that bad* in GL |Game|Banner|Step Up/max Laps|Guaranteed **Featured** 5 #9733;?|Special Ticket Exchange|No. of Special Tickets Obtainable|Total Cost to get on-banner unit| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|--:| |JP|CG Prince Noctis/CG AK Rain|25k/5 Laps|Yes (Either)|5x Ticket for CG Noctis/CG AK Rain (Choice)|2x/Lap|**60,000**| |JP|Lunafreya/CG Dark Fina|24.5k/3 Laps|No|No|-| |GL|CG Prince Noctis/Lunafreya|9k/10 Laps|No|8x for Either (Random)/ 16x Ticket for CG Noctis/Lunafreya (Choice)|2x/Lap|36,000/**72,000**| Despite the eye-popping costs, keep in mind that at the end of the day, you can prism either of the units in GL. So why the mad rush? You can skip this banner, get either of them from an off-pull rainbow and prism them anytime you like. JP didn't have that luxury and it was a "now or never" situation. If you've already bled dry on the double king banner, it is most likely that you won't have a chance at getting Lunafreya unless you have superb luck on ticket pulls or can exchange real cash for lapis ~~aka whaling~~. --- Thus concludes self-reassurance 101. *breathes* --- Now to the main point - the TYPE of step up models they're using.  gt; "If they do this to FFXV banner, they could do it again for future FF series!"  gt; "I thought this shitty step up was *exclusive* to Black Friday only! WTH GUMI!"  gt; "What'll happen to (insert favorite FF unit)'s banner?!" Fuck yeah. This is the part that absolutely grinds off my gears. Just when we thought this kinda step up was *only exclusive* to Black Friday, they proved us wrong by applying it to FFXV. **FFXV**! I knew all along that the idea of them giving us on-banner prisms wasn't "free". We had to trade something else for it. And this is probably it - the step-up model. What I foresee: The special 9+1+1 summon will only be for FFBE units while the current 2 step-up model will apply to all FF units going forward. We can only *hope* that the latter stops here and now and does not roll over. That is all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pre-Pull Depression - FFXV Brotherhood</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 20:23:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know there's been a guy going round doing post-pulls writeups but if [someone can do a pre-edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/ds311c/prepull_chair_rain_depression_thread/), so can I! It's a free country! #CG Crown Prince Noctis[CG Noctis](#I/Icons/u1604/) **Who is he?** Dude's a prince on a bachelor party when things start going terribly wrong. He's Regina 2.0 or as you may call him, Noctgina. Kit for Kit, he does the same as what she does. V-combo finisher with a chaining [CG LB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEwAwsEROu0). **Is he good?** Depends. Can you provide him with all the necessary support like a [training teacher](https://youtu.be/rUsOpKnHtZY?t=618), [a childhood friend turned cameraman who lost weight](https://youtu.be/cji-L0hu1Io?t=676) and a butler chef who [takes what Noctis's doesn't want in his burger](https://youtu.be/TNzXtGxP3Hc?t=141)? If so, then he'll be good in your hands. **I already have AK Rain, should I pull?** Do you like chairs? The only difference between them is their chairs. Noctis sits on his before warping in his LB but Rain's follow him all year round - even when he's taking a shit! Oh and obviously there's a color difference - one's navy blue and the other's an obnoxious red. One's from IKEA and the other's from Wayfair. Hey! Don't look at me as if I've played musical chairs all my life! How would I know which one's which?! #Lady Lunafreya[Lunafreya](#I/Icons/u1610/) **Who is she?** For the english speakers, she's [Lena Heady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Headey_filmography#Video_games). For the japanese folks, she's [Rina Kitagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rina_Kitagawa). She's also the last straw that made a whole ton of people quit the JP version. What can I say? She's a shocker!  #5461;(  #5147; ) #5463; **Is she good?** Do I look like the sorta person you can ask this question to? Do you like trident wielding blondes? For all I know, she took Triton's weapon and gave Ariel a run for her money. There's tonnes of things she does like mitigation, imbues, high value multi imperils, heals etc - you know, support stuff. I ain't spoon feeding ya! Go check [her kit out](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Lunafreya/JP) ya bunch of lazy fuckers! **I already have XXX support, should I pull?** Am I a helpdesk? Look at your own team, spot the missing components and figure it out you scrubs! If all else fails, ask /u/Sinzar_ or the Daily Help Thread! --- If you're after my personal opinion, I wouldn't go ham on this banner. I mean, you can prism them whenever you like as long as you've landed a copy somehow and got 8 pieces of UoC. They aren't detrimentally required for any trials unless you're seriously prepping for Dark Visions in 2020. That is all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The changes in step-up banners aren't GLEX^TM. It started in JP where they removed the usual step ups and swapped in the ticket campaign where you collect a certain number of tickets and exchange them for the featured on-banner units via regular 10+1 pulls. This started during the Esper unit mashups and have been on-going for quite a while now: |5 #9733;Unit Name|Step Up/max Laps|Guaranteed **Featured** 5 #9733;?|Special Ticket Exchange|No. of Special Tickets Obtainable|JP Link| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |CG Ifrit Rain/Bahamut Fina/Diabolos Sol/Asura Akstar|4k/Regular 10+1|Yes (Random/Of Choice)|10x Ticket for Random/30x Ticket for Choice|1x/10+1|[Esper Unit KM 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dbdpwm/jp_4th_anni_esper_units_more_banners_megathread/)| |CG Shiva Lasswell/Alexander Charlotte/Odin Raegen/Tetra Sylphid Physalis|4k/Regular 10+1|Yes (Random/Of Choice)|10x Ticket for Random/30x Ticket for Choice|1x/10+1|[Esper Units SE](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dim465/jp_4th_anni_esper_units_2_banners_megathread/)| |CG Cloud/Tifa (FFVIIAC)|5K/Regular 10+1|Yes (Random/Of Choice)|10x Ticket for Random/30x Ticket for Choice|1x/10+1 |[FFVII AC](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dpmb8k/jp_ff7_advent_children_banners_megathread_1111115/)| |CG Serah/Noel|5K/Regular 10+1|No|30x Ticket for featured units|1x/10+1|[FFXIII-2](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/e3wafy/jp_ffxiii2_banners_megathread_1211215/)| |Christmas Ayaka/Santa Lottie|Regular 10+1/18k/Lap |Yes (Either)|30x Ticket for featured units|2x from Stepup/1x from 10+1|[JP Xmas II](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/e6va8m/jp_christmas_2019_ayakalotti_banners_megathread/)| |CG Daisy|5K/Regular 10+1|No|30x Ticket for featured units|1x/10+1|[Daisy SE](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/e93yd9/jp_story_event_39_daisy_banners_megathread/)| --- In GL, it started with the Black Friday banner and rolled over to this Thursday's FFXV.

    <TITLE>Grinds my Gears: Ticket Removal from KM Shop</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-12 20:32:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears*? The KM rework and removal of tickets from the KM shop. And in it's place, a slot machine coin where you *stand a chance* to get a variety of tickets! Has the Mog King gone to Vegas one time too many?! I knew this change was coming looking at what JP got but I was probably hoping a little too much that GL wouldn't implement this. Once again, when expectation doesn't meet reality, disappointment sets in. Fast. Not only is there *more* RNG added, the amount of time to farm all the rewards has [increased to 10 days](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/e9pnje/psa_ep_updated_milestones/)! **10 fucking days** with naturally occurring NRG with no refills! Do you know what I could accomplish within 10 days?! Okay probably not much but still, 10 days for a (soon-to-be) casual like me is MONUMENTOUS! And even though I get to gain one more "special" 5 #9733; ticket than usual, I'm still complaining! You know why? Because the odds of me landing an on-banner unit with that ticket is close to, if not, nuts! It has **never** happened before and I'm sure this time it'll be no different. The only thing I'm grateful for several hours ago from this update is that I petrified Ardyn and walked away with 1k lapis in under a minute. My video clear will have to wait. That is all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears?* RNG. For several months, I've been running mageless. No mages pop from my pulls- whether its step ups, accursed 5+1s, normal tickets, EX Tickets, or even the special guaranteed 5 #9733; ticket from KM event. Following my mage drought, the game decided to troll me further by dropping multiple copies of outdated mDPS like Lulu, BS Sakura, Dark Fina  amp;amp;amp;amp; Emperor such that I obtained their STMRs. But who could I use them on? I still didn't have any of the really strong chainers like Christine or Elly or Circe even. Then all of a fucking sudden, RNG decides that it has had its fill of trolling me. The recent 10+1s nabbed me 2 Sols, 2 DM Exdeaths and 2 Circes! HORRAY its raining mages! I should be happy right? No. No, I'm not. You know why? Because this week, Gumi drops WF Dark Fina. And I'm 100% confident that the trolling will begin once again right when I expect my mage streak to continue. Fuck!

    <TEXT>**Magic** elemental imbue. Yes, you read that right. Magic! I mean I was just looking at WLDF and thought to myself: how nice it would be if there's a unit that could provide magic elemental imbue. Then she can elementally chain her LB. I mean if there's such things like "adding fire element to *physical* attacks", why can't we "add fire element to *magical* attacks?". Other current/future units whose highest nuke stems from non-elemental magic damage would greatly benefit from this like DM Exdeath/Sol/Bahamut Fina etc. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grinds my Gears: Upcoming FFBE Story Units</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-04 20:07:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears*? Upcoming FFBE Story Units, namely Sakura of the Deltar Star (SoDS)  amp;amp; Nichol of the Epsilon Star (NoES) and the lack of originality. [SoDS](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Sakura_of_the_Delta_Star/JP) is basically a mage version of CPN/Regina- perfect and complete with perma V-cast, killer buffs and mod boosts to her finishing skill. The upgrade? Her LB **elementally chains**! ~~At first glance, you might think~~ [NoES](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Nichol_of_the_Epsilon_Star/JP) DOES bring better buffs, support and role compression ~~but he's basically a copy + pasta of MS Nichol with shittier numbers and the ability to now AoE ice imbue~~ ~~Oh and he doesn't debuff your team while buffing them~~ ~~At least he's finally mastered the art of war I suppose~~ I retract what I say. /u/dangderr has proven me wrong about NoES. Looks like he's really awesome afterall! Talk about a (minor) let down. D: Despite the lack the originality, the said units are still good. ( #9583; #176; #9633; #176;) #9583; #65077;  #9531; #9473; #9531; Needless to say, I'm hopeful that they'll receive some GLEX buffs. That is all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Real Talk: Trading Outdated 5 #9733; Units for Trust Coins</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-05 22:46:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Foreword: Incoming downvote magnet post. Controversial as it is, this is what I've actually done over the past few days: analyzing what units do I not need at all and what potential units I can keep for the upcoming Dark Visions event where you can only bring your own units- no companions allowed. *"Heathen!" "Blasphemy!" "Sacrilege!"* I know. Especially since we haven't gotten the parameter missions on the number of 7 #9733; units awoken. However, I'm hovering around with more than a 100 7 #9733; awakenings. Even if I dip below 80 units, I couldn't care less. I don't use all of them for that matter- even for Chamber of Vengeful. The units that I've exchanged have all into the following categories: * STMRed Units * Outdated Units * Time Limited Units Units that've already gotten their STMRs and are lying around collecting dust will see a quick trip to the coin exchange. Some of these include Gilgamesh, Luneth, Lila, Nalu etc. The most controversial one: Time Limited Units, especially DD, are more of a novelty collection with little to no purpose. It really depends on your friend list. Fortunately, majority of mine only use the latest FF(BE) DD. The ones I've exchanged: Sora, KH Cloud, Dragon Lord, Eleven, Rab etc. I **really hate** DQ units. Since we're getting Dissidia models of some of these units in the future, it makes it even less sensible to have them around. If it's a unit that I seldom or hardly use in battle, it's off to the exchange: Tidus, Onion Knight, Squall, Cloud etc. Feel free to express yourselves here. I'm interested to see folks who share the same mindset as myself.</TEXT>

Welp, I've completely forgotten I've got this mini series on-going. New Year, New Forgotten series? If prediction holds and if we do get a raid, there are 3 possible ones that come to mind: * [Full Metal Alchemist](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dzg2he/jp_banners_full_metal_alchemist_collab_1121_1130/) * [Regis/Ardyn](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/bqskb9/jp_ffxv_ardynregis_banners_megathread_520_531/) * [Lid/Jake  amp; Fina/Dark Fina](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/b38bai/jp_ffbe_weapon_banners_megathread_320331/) Don't forget that we'll be probably getting a livestream soon^TM along with possible GLEX CNY units. I mean since JP is getting [Mouse Marie](https://i.imgur.com/5J9ujlH.jpg), GL *should* get something along the lines as well!

Each of which comes with its own sets of skills. When he's in Dark Mode, his skills costs **20% HP** to cast. I've tagged them correspondingly. He also gets one turn of 75% general mitigation by switching modes with 100% uptime if you constantly switch. (Thanks /u/BPCena for the last part) * ~~Lightning XIII-2 is a free KM unit and reason why I did not hyperlink her gamepedia info neatly like the rest is due to formatting issues. Not because she's free.~~ ~~Lol~~ Link working properly now. Thanks /u/dangderr! * Alphonse is a Time Limited Unit and the Full Metal Alchemist collab is subjected to availability in GL. * We have some GLEX tanks coming along the way from the Unit Design contest last year (hey! another "year" joke!) with unknown ETA and unknown numbers/kits so make ample preparations if needed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What happened to the CG designs of S3 BE units?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-08 16:47:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Note**: This is an unpopular opinion so let it rain downvotes. Also, **obligatory spoilers** if you don't wanna see any of the characters in S3 yet. I mean like what the fuck. Look at the recent CG animations: *  gt;![CG Daisy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pj6ueEJYdk)! lt;
     *  gt;![CG Kalmia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjRACfX6vUk amp;feature=youtu.be)! lt;
     I have no complaints on their actual sprites as it's fairly decent: *  gt;![Daisy](https://i.imgur.com/efOv0HC.jpg)! lt;
    *  gt;![Kalmia](https://i.imgur.com/Z514FEm.jpg)! lt;
     But the hell happened to their CGs? Are the JP artists/animators okay? Did they go numb or something? The CGs lack emotions on their faces unlike the cast of S2. And the latest one? Seriously? Are they trying THAT hard at the start of the year to dip into fanservicing? Crappy face design with plenty of cleavage? Is that it? *tries very hard not to flip any table*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My 2020 Pull Plan for FFBE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-08 21:57:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>After comparing my own monthly outlook with /u/jonidschultz's [DPS Future Watch](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/dtpcwo/future_watch_power_plateau_to_super_spike/), I realize that I can actually safely skip every god damn DPS banner like HK Lasswell, CG Onion Knight, CG Tidus or CG Zidane all the way up till Odin Raegen, AC Cloud and CG Squall. THAT is when I'll probably pull for those 3. I strongly believe that AKR/WLDF would suffice for trials up until then. As for tanks, if I do get P. Cecil, I can skip Charxander. Same goes for support. Since I already have eIgnis and Elephim on standby for her enhancements, I can hold off NoES too. Looks like 2020 will be a year of skipping and hoarding (for now)!</TEXT>

Here's my list of candidates: * Regina * Fid * MS Nichol * AKR * WLDF * Ignis * K.Ayaka * DK Leon * Eiko * 2B * Fire Veritas * Lunera * Sol * Queen * Myra * Circe * Aranea Even though I listed out that many, it's actually only a real contest among Regina, AKR, WLDF and Queen.</TEXT>

Camera starts from Wilhelm's legs, pausing for a brief second to show that he hasn't skipped leg day this time, moving up, showing a bulge that's made more obvious by his tight red shorts that reads "Lifeguard" at the side. Camera continues going up to his manly bear chest that would give Zangief a run for his money before stopping at his face where WIlhelm tugs gently on a side of his grand moustache, pulls down his awesome shades and says "Looks like you need a hand!", smiling and revealing his perfect pearly whites that bling before jumping into the water. Cue big splash and CG ends. #Equipment Selection |Category|Equipment| :--|:--| |Weapons|Daggers/Swords/Spears/Throwing Weapons| |Armors|L Shield/H Shield/Hat/Helmet/H Armor/L Armor/Clothes/Accessory| #Passives |Min Rarity|Passive Skill Name|Effect| :--|:--|:--| |5 #9733;|Body Builder|Increase resistance to all ailments by 50% (includes zombify/ berserk/charm)| |5 #9733;|Manliness Overload|Chance to counter physical/magical damage (100%)| |5 #9733;|Life Guard In-Training|Chance to ignore fatal damage (100%) when HP is above 40% (max 1 time)| |5 #9733;|Keen Observation|Increase LB fill rate (150%)| |6 #9733;|Clear Mind|Increase resistance to petrify/paralyze/confuse/silence by 50%| |6 #9733;|Quick Reflexes|Increase resistance to blind/sleep/poison/disease by 50%| |6 #9733;|Superb Stamina|At start of battle or when revived: Allows caster to dodge 3 physical/magical attacks for 3 turns.| |6 #9733;|The Ladies' Man|Increase chance of being targeted (80%).

HK Lasswell SE might be a little too soon since we just completed WLDF's SE 2 weeks ago. But hey, I don't mind more crystal farming stages.... If JP got Mouse Marie, then we *should* get something similar theme-wise if not exactly the same. But knowing GL, we'll probably have some sort of wave battle or a CNY precursor (Fire?) at least. As for S3, we *should* see a word on it soon, if not, together with the long awaited World Reset at least...Cmon' we need to start moving on the story already!

If you do, then this [other one](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/eog2n2/gl_120_imperil_and_imbue_units_img/) will let you access those killers with 100%~ value. I'll try to maintain this whenever there's an update on either GL/JP.

    <DATE>2020-01-14 21:21:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is the **second** "PPD" I'm doing ever since the previous one which was last year! HA! ANOTHER YEAR JOKE!  #5461;(  #5147; ) #5463; #(Free) Hong Kong Lasswell[CG King Lasswell](#I/Icons/u1586/) ###Who is he? Didn't you hear? If AK Rain's chair is from IKEA, then Lassie's chair must be from Living Spaces! Why can't it be other brands you say? Of course it can! Just conjure up random furniture brands in your head and throw it in! The first one that came to my mind is Living Spaces. Why? Because if it has a "L" and a "S" in its name, then **surely** it must be for him right?! ###Is he good? Is Akstar good? Is *any* stacking damage dealer good to you? I mean if they die, they lose their stacks. If you're fine with restacking him up like how you stack your chairs back in school, then it you *should be* fine! Also, his STMR reads "**True** Purple Lightning". Are you telling me that the one crafted by Ignacio, who obviously slept with Suzume, titled "[Purple Lightning](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Purple_Lightning)", passed down from Raegen to Lassie was a dupe all along? I'm sorry I don't follow anime much. Does it anything to do with the naming? Please enlighten me o' glorious weeabos! ###I already have XXX DPS. Should I pull? Are you a fan of collecting chairs? Do you have a set of *chair*men in your team? If so, adding one more to your collection wouldn't hurt. If you're like myself who absolutely detest musical chairs, then skip his banner! There are plenty more DPS coming right up your door! #Scartio [Scartio](#I/Icons/u1592/) ###Who is he? I have absolutely zero idea. A friend of Scar's from Lion King perhaps? I mean his hair *does* look like sorta mane right? ###Is he good? Is any 4 #9733; unit good these days? You might wanna grab his TMR if you're into y'know... *beast-human* stuff.. #Sister [Sister](#I/Icons/u1595/) ###Who is she? If you already have [Brother](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Brother), which I guess many of you do, well, this is his Sister then! Where's the rest of the family at? ###Is she good? You be the judge. Treat the siblings equally to avoid any family feud! If you've sold Brother to the Trust Coin shop, don't let him sit alone! Send his sister in there as well so that they can be together forever! --- Honestly, the only thing I like about this Thursday's post-maintenance content is the Story Event's name- "A Prayer for Hess." Don't we always do that? Send our thoughts and prayers whenever there's a global crisis somewhere? Looks like Gumi followed suit instead of giving us our Expert Missions and World Reset!

    <TITLE>Weekly News Prediction - January Week 4</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-19 22:15:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Week | Possible News | Long story short ---|---|---| 4 | HK Lasswell SE Week 2 | The usual crysts farming. - | Item World | *Hopefully* - | Scorn of Bomb Family | Next up - | Shinryu | Deader than SRDG  #9756;( #65439; #12526; #65439; #9756;) - | S3 Chapter 1 | It's almost time for it - | Esper Awakenings | Bahamut 2 #9733; maybe? - | Unit Awakenings | Overdue for Elephim/Jecht/Tifa/Crimson -| GLEX^TM CNY Wave Battle? | What else could it be? So /u/BPCena [guessed HK Lassie's SE right last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBEblog/comments/enrwfw/weekly_news_prediction_january_week_3/fe4tb22/?utm_source=share amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf )! Who knew he, too, had such foresight! Thanks to him, we've established a pattern. Time between Physalis and WLDF's SE: 21 days. Time between WLDF and HK Lassie's SE is **also** 21 days. If pattern holds true, the next SE (Madam Edel hopefully) technically falls on Feb 6th. Now, this week should be an interesting one. It's almost the end of January which means S3 Chapter 1 *should* be en route along with Bahamut 2 #9733; (maybe). We've also yet to get Item World for this month that's another thing to consider. Scorn of the Bomb Family to add? Why not? Onto the **main highlight**: Chinese New Year falls on this coming Sat, Jan 25th. This means the banner this week *should* be a CNY GLEX^TM Banner. What units? We have not a clue. Rat Mage Marie is a possibility but knowing GL, they'll likely throw in something flashy like Fire Godrea for instance. Plus, where's the damn update video?! It's been more than a month since the Winter update on Dec 16th last year!  #9756;( #65439; #12526; #65439; #9756;). Let us see if they'll have it up latest by Jan 20th. --- That is all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>GLEX Content: Precursor/Time Keeper/Nirvana/Five Gods</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-21 18:10:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Figured I put this together since GLEX^TM content is now a thing. I'll keep this post updated whenever they release new units that falls into any of the Precursor/Time Keeper/Nirvana categories. --- #Precursors Here's the list of known precursors with their respective element representation: |Unit CSS|Unit Name|Element|Element CSS| :--|:--|:--|:--| |[Esther](#I/Icons/u8229/)|Esther|[Storm](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Precursor_of_the_Storm)|[](#Z/Icons/z3/)| |[Kaito](#I/Icons/u8262/)|Kaito|[Sea](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Precursor_of_the_Sea)|[](#Z/Icons/z4/)| |[Elena](#I/Icons/u8256/)|Elena|[Aurora](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Precursor_of_the_Aurora)|[](#Z/Icons/z7/)| |[Karten](#I/Icons/u8241/)|Karten|[Shadow](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Precursor_of_the_Shadow)|[](#Z/Icons/z8/)| Just to clarify on Elena's element alignment, she does not represent ice. If you've paid close attention to the "Save Your Elf" event, you'll know that the Precursor of Blizzard is still to be found- based off the [Libra](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Elf_Off_the_Shelf) of "Elf off the Shelf":  gt; A "Great Destroyer" sealed by a brave warrior long ago. The seal has grown weaker over time, allowing a mysterious malignant spirit to regain some of its lost power. Unable to exist without a host, the spirit found and possessed a toy elf who had escaped from his workshop after growing tired of working all day and night. Its innate weakness to ice has been speculated to be the reason why the Precursor of the Blizzard was able to seal it in the past. **With the Precursor of the Blizzard yet to be found in the present**, it is up to Levinson #8212;the King of Toys #8212;and his faithful mechanical soldier to save their possessed friend. This leaves us with fire/wind/earth/ice as the remaining elements unless Gumi decides to include "non-elemental" into their list.

But to make things more interesting, since Christine #8217;s designated title is the  #8220;Last Time Keeper #8221; instead of specifically mentioning  #8220;12th #8220;, she could very well be the 13th Time Keeper for all we know. This whole Precursor-Time Keeper shenanigan started with her anyway! From Kryla/Christine's story, we also know the names of two other time keepers: Angelica and Cruze.

I #8217;m *assuming* Emperor Foo represents the yellow dragon due to his sprite design with the obvious golden dragon as his crown. If he isn't, then we should expect a sole unit for next year's CNY banner to complete the lore. #Future Speculation Once all the precursors, time keepers and nirvanas have been assembled, be prepared for a possible GLEX^TM event/trial/banner to bring everyone together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Extracted from the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xingtian)  gt; Xingtian (Chinese:  #21009; #22825;; pinyin: X #237;ngti #257;n; "Opposing Heaven", also Hsing T'ien) is a Chinese deity who fights against the Supreme Divinity, not giving up even after the event of his decapitation. Losing the fight for supremacy, he was beheaded and his head buried in Changyang Mountain. Nevertheless, **headless, with a shield in one hand and a battle axe in the other**, he continues the fight, **using his nipples as eyes and his bellybutton as a mouth** although they could not see.  gt; Xingtian symbolizes the indomitable spirit which maintains the will to resist no matter what tribulations one may undergo or what troubles one may encounter. As such, Xingtian has been lauded in poetry and prose. Looks like Gumi's gotten a little creative with the [upcoming "I smell a Rat" event](https://lapis-prod-staticnews-gumi-sg.akamaized.net/prod//en/img/20200122ISmellARat.jpg)....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Welcome to another GL Monthly Outlook ft February potential banners, a place where latent abilities and awakenings don #8217;t get delayed!

    <TITLE>Cleared Scorn of Bomb Family on first try with WLDF</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-23 18:44:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Prior to my earlier thread [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBEblog/comments/eriujg/team_comps_for_scorn_of_bomb_family/) regarding team comps, it turns out that literally **NONE** of my friends on my list I've seen thus far (except dangder) within 5 refreshes has a demon killer setup on AKR. 99% of them had either Man Eater+ or Beast Killer setup.... So instead of mindlessly refreshing and trying to find a team with AKR, I settled with WLDF and guess what? She cleared that trial within the first attempt! Kudos to my WLDF friend (I'm sorry I forgot your IGN) who has Barb's STMR and **two** Hexatheon Revelations in the setup. I'll probably do a proper video recording later once I'm free. My tactic was basically taking Dad bomb down really fast with Quad cast Red Demise and then slowly working Mom bomb down with Black Demise. The AoE reraise from LM Fina helped a great deal too. And of course, MVP is eIgnis with his 80% elemental resist buff.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grinds my Gears: Recent spike in burst modifiers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-24 19:45:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>*You know what grinds my gears*? The recent spike in burst modifiers. This topic solely revolves around the burst capability of a unit within the first 3 turns. After looking at a couple of videos featuring Karten and XWQL, I can safely say that the next couple of GLEX^TM DPS units eg. Precursor series will undoubtedly feature an exponential level of burst. Looking *solely* at the **base mods** excluding any CD boosters/killers/chain bonuses: Unit | Base Mod for Burst | Turn ---|---|---| XWQL | 180 | 2 Karten | 99 | 1 AKR | 35 | 2 What in the actual fuck? AKR looks like absolute jack shit next to those two! I mean if the battle can conclude within the first 3 turns or less **if you have a particular setup**, what's the point in pulling for units that need to fight out the battle across more than 10 turns other than nostalgic value? That is all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I did a random half price pulled and got my first XWQL. Decided to go ahead with the step up but had only enough for 2 steps. Got my 1st WoL Lenna and 1st BM Golbez along with 3rd Sol. But no signs of XWQL. I'm left with 3k lapis now. Should I attempt to reach 5k somehow and perform the 3rd step or...?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean who else could it be? XWQL! In all honesty, I didn't have any hype to pull on their banner at all. But right after I pulled one from the half pull, I dived head in without thinking. I'm not sure if it's the sprite design or some sorta unseen force magnetizing me to pull or I'm actually subconsciously desiring to pull on their banner. I haven't actually got around to pulling the 3rd step as I'm short on lapis. Lmao. Also, kudos to whoever updated the blog design! It makes me feel less bad that I'm posting *another* XWQL post!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Quest to obtain XWQL #2 (Part I)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-30 16:18:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Previously... on [my LNY Adventure](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFBEblog/comments/etvx2g/next_course_of_action/), I recently obtained my first copy of XWQL, coincidentally one of the most popular units to dates which flooded both the main sub and blog with their presence; even though there wasn't any hype to begin with... Inevitably, I dived into the step up banner, knowing well that I was short on lapis to even make it to the 3rd step. As a result, I've pulled 0 copies on the first two steps. **Today**, before going into the 3rd step, I tried exhausting my other options - rare summon tickets and 4 #9733; tickets from World Revisit, naively thinking that I might just save that precious hard earned 5k lapis. On the last 4 #9733; ticket, it miraculously broke into...  gt;!Elena #2! lt; Great! Just great! My hopes shattered like the rainbow crystal, sending my dreams and hopes everywhere into the void. Plan B. 3rd step. With just enough lapis to perform the 3rd step of the 1st lap, I went ahead, chanting and praying RNG to give me a 2nd copy. As the crystals popped one by one, with none of them forming back into a rainbow, my dream of getting a 2nd copy vanished until the last guaranteed rainbow which broke into....  gt;!Dr Aiden #2! lt;
