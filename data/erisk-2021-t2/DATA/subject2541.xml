    <TITLE>What is required to make an MMORPG?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-20 03:33:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope this is the appropriate place to ask a question like this. I am currently working on a novel and I am curious...What exactly is required before a developer releases an MMORPG to the public? I Have no Idea what it takes. Say I have a team and we completely finished an MMORPG game. Whats next? Is there legal action? I know there's ESRB ratings required? Do they have to reserve a domain online? Is money required?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you Just what I needed! One more thing. Is there anything that could have authorities have the game taken down? Or is there anything this person or team can do besides copyright infringement that puts there game at risk? Also could the creator be...anonymous?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. I mean just the risk of being shut down by the authorities. I was wondering if it would be viable writing about an MMORPG that seemed to just "show up" for users to play. I have few more ways I could spin my story but you've helped me understand a bit more about MMORPGs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Worried for my friend. And a little sad.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-20 08:09:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I have **some questions about peripheral neuropathy (Sensory).** My friend was recently diagnosed with it a few weeks ago. I listened to her complain about losing feeling or feeling numb in her feet for about a week or 2 before she was able to finally find a doctor pinpoint it. It had since seemed to move up to her hands and part of her face. We usually play a lot of online games and write together so this has really shaken things up for both of us but most of all her. She can't write like she used to or feel the keys a lot of the time when she presses buttons. She also was diagnosed with Sensory Neuropathy so **she can't feel sensations hot or cold. But she says she can feel pressure. She said the Dr said that it's on her Legs face and upper shoulders but I don't remember her specifically saying hands.** She has said that smoking weed seemed to help before but it doesn't always work. She also has carpal tunnel on her wrist and elbow. From my knowledge, I read that Carpal tunnel can go away if treated correctly. She has some sort of brace on her arm. **Could it be the Carpel tunnel mainly causing the numbness and pin needles in her hands? Will that helps get some of her feelings back if that goes away. WILL it go away?** She did some more tests but I can't quite remember what they were but the DR did say something about possibly being able to reverse some of the effects. I'm sorry this was a lot but my main question is. **Will her neuropathy get worst? Will, it spread more or is this the worst it will get for her?** **Do you have experience or know anyone that has trouble writing, typing, and playing games because of these symptoms? Have you found anything that helps?**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, I'll really try to bring something you find enjoyable. Its what I like too. Here are some Japanese Media I liked the idea of. Dothacks game was interesting but it never made sense to me how someone could go into a coma wearing a plain old visor. It never made sense how someone could get trapped in the game. They never really explained why anything was happening. It had a sense of wonder but never satisfied any of my curiosities. It never went into numbers or stats either or why at times they could "feel" things. Sword art, on the other hand, has a pretty cool premise. They talk about numbers and game mechanics but the characters are so bad because of the Harem. People still enjoy this series a lot clearly despite having their complaints. I am also someone who likes the idea of jumping into a world like that so I think that's what it may be.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I MIGHT have adhd and I feel like no one is taking me seriously.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-28 22:12:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>**As a child** I have been forgetful, I have gotten laughed at I've felt like I just don't get things sometimes and sometimes over-emotional. I didn't learn to tie my shoes until I was 10 or 11 so I did this half baked twist. I did random things on the spur of the moment one thing like walking up and in 1st grade literally turning a girls head to see who she was because she wouldn't turn around and I couldn't tell if she was another girl I knew. Some other stupid stuff at home I'd rather not say. I've gotten in trouble for drawing in class when or not paying attention when the teacher was talking. And throughout the rest of grade school I struggled in most of my subjects because they were boring. Not art. **I daydream constantly and think think think at night. So much that it always keeps me up. I can't fall asleep unless I am dead tired.** As an adult, I constantly forget to pay bills on time when I have the money. Luckily now there is auto pay but I get over-drafted sometimes still with that. I lose my keys every other day, My wallet even when I have a chain on it (though the chain helps) and my Credit card twice my debit card 3 times last year...I didn't replace the debit after the 3rd and I still haven't found it. I Forget things at work constantly even when I literally just looked at it and have a list. It happens so frequently everyone jokes about me being forgetful and if I have my wallet this and that. It's funny sometimes but it gets annoying others even though I laugh. If they didn't like me they would have fired me by now. I've forgotten an entire delivery once and let the order go bad in the back of the van. **Talking with parents :** I feel like they don't take me seriously. I'm 27 and I am nowhere that I hoped I would be. I still live with my mom because I can't seem to land a new job and I really don't want to be a driver anymore. I tell my mom I feel like I have ADHD and she seems like she is upset with me but she tells me to just go book an appointment. I ask her if she feels like she could have it because it can run in families. IDK if she has hyperfocus because there are literally times when she will stare at something shes working on and drown out any noise around her even when 3 people are yelling her name. She says its because shes older and has responsibilities. Which can very well be the case. She never even likes to relax. But she says as a kid "I was always the quiet kid I know how to focus etc. " and yet you don't need to be hyper active to have adhd. I've gotten told "You gotta do better" from moms boy friend and "You gotta make something happen." My aunt called me lazy when I try so hard. I just can't take this anymore. I felt like when I got a job and learned to drive this was great but no...not to everyone else..not for long. **My mom blames it on our generation growing up in the internet generation but no one seems to be as bad and behind as me... and my other friend who actually does have ADD though he never takes anything or seeks help for it. He kind of ignores when I tell him he should.** **Dad when it comes to my Dad. He says I grew up in the gaming generation and I play lots of games. So take that into account. He seriously never listens to me either. Even though he tries.** I just don't want to go to the doctor and see that nothing is wrong when I feel like so much is. I don't have insurance and I recently got a pretty bad traffic ticket for speeding on accident because guess what I wasn't paying attention. **Is it viable to go see a doctor or is this most likely just me being raised with internet and gaming? I'm sorry this is so long. I don't mind if you skim.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One other thing I forgot to mention I remembered faintly that I was taken to check for ADHD in high school but I do not remember the outcome. I only went there once and something tells me we didn't finish checking or something along the lines of not wanting me to take medicine or that it took a really long time. I don't know if it matters but I thought it was my mother that took me but it ended up being my grandmother and she is dead now so I can't ask her.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-30 10:46:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ill try to keep this short and sweet. (Sorry typing on a phone in my car) Im 27 and I live with my mother. Recently graduated full sail with my associates degree in animation (i regret it but oh well) I work as a delivery driver for a bakery and i get paid 9.50 plus my hours are pretty much cut so i only get about 185 every two weeks now. My credit score is 725. Ive saved over 2000 dollars so if I ever landed a decent paying job I could move out. Thats the thing. Despite getting my degree and despite working at my job for 2 almost 3 years now. I cant get another one. I have extreamly flat feet so any job where i have to stand all day is grueling so im trying to avoid it. My mother pretty much complains says she doesnt want me to waste my life be a man do something etc. And hell ive told her myself. I dont want to live with her. I want my own place. She treats me like i enjoy living under her. She really never takes a word i say seriously. But shes recently gone to making me go outside at 6am to go do something. As if I am some sort of shut in who doesnt know how to talk to women. I am introverted but im seriously not as bad as she thinks. I had so many plans that failed and now I dont know what to do. I have 4 months to find some way to move out with the scraps I make at my job. What do I do?? I can sraw and animate but i have no following. Im currently writing a book fantasy scifi set in a virtual world and simulated universe. Is there anyway i can land a extra job or something on the side with my skill set. I personally dont think im a failiure but sometimes its really hard not to be down...and to top it im almost positive I have adhd. I need a job where i can at least make 12.00 but if i can get something online andkeep my current job maybe i have a chance. Otherwise im going to live in my car and thats way better than the street.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TBH so many people see everything in this show as homosexual representation. I think back in the barn days one of the storyboarders was trying to force a Peridot and Amethyst thing on the low. But I digress. Steven and Greg are just that. The fusion between father and son. They both love music and Greg wanted to be a big rockstar and Steven sees his dad like that already so thats probably why they are the way they are. why his abs and shit are bursting out of his clothes? hes a Big guy and steven wore even smaller clothes than Greg. I Just feel like their face should resemble more of steven and Greg like the other fusions do the sum of their parts but I get what they were going for.</TEXT>

Or maybe they should just released Viera with helmets and hair. Who cares about race exclusive hair. They already released 2 hairstyles for everyone else now without updating what hrothgar and viera have viera have 8 and the gar literally can't change their hair at all. Thats no fun at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly rabbit ears are very flexible. With lop ear bunnies its not like its rigid and stuck like that. If you move them you can straighten them. Bunny ears can move in a few different directions even laydown on the heador move side to side. I wouldn't complain if they give the same ear style on certain hats and hoods. I Mean i'm not expecting lola bunny flexibility in the ears but if they want they can literally do anything to fix the problem. Rabbits have 270 degrees of movement with there ears.</TEXT>

And the thing is. I don't even like these helmets; Its the principle that counts. I want to have a choice. If I want to look like an asshole in this lame ass helmet come on let me look like an asshole. I just can't believe they haven't even tried to get any of these helmets working on the newer races. Its not that they can't. Its that they just won't do it. 100% Facts. They don't want to edit the models even more for these races takes too much time.</TEXT>

My boss tried to help me remedy the problem but at the end of the day, he said he couldn't afford this anymore so I had to be let go. (Possibly giving me something else in the future). Can I file for employment and if I can what category would I put this under: Layoff due to Coronavirus fire terminated or discharged from a job If I put fired whats the sub-category.

    <TEXT>Lol didn't bother me when I played an Elezen. That's funny that that bothered you #8212;to want every single elezen to acknowledge you. Anyway, the reason I ask is because Viera are so territorial and this is our first ever encounter with the natives. Of course, none of the flavor text actually pushes the story's main plot ahead but it can be funny or interesting still. When playing other races I have indeed gotten special responses in the past. Also, I'm not aware of how widespread Viis are is in the first. So it's not too absurd I think for one of the natives to take notice of A Viis walking alongside the scions. Since a Viera would be a person of the wood Why would they try to kill another one for walking through the woods? I assume because perhaps the rules are different since these are Viis and not exactly the same as Viera. so yeah, a teeny tiny sentence woulda been cool. They're just for fun usually.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ahh true Midgardsormr is a thing. I feel we may go to a whole different planet because of the nier stuff. I don't think we're going specifically to nier's world though. It was just something she said that kinda goes with the Final chapter of our star thing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When do teaser trailers usually come out?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 06:45:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Each expansion usually lasts about 2 years or so right? I know Covid slowed things down quite a bit but if none of that happened would it be safe to assume that 6.0 would have come out around summer 2021 5.4 should be the last part of Eden then 5.5 would be the final nier raid so I'm trying to figure this out. With the lack of a fanfest and covid slowing things down now I was just wondering when you guys think we would see a teaser trailer for 6.0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually I think Redmage would have that omph for a trailer. It uses a sword and big spells so yeah. Definitely if it was something that wanted to combine Light and Darkness then red would definitely be that thing. Also I want them to incorporate the warrior of light working with more warriors of light so we don't have to be the only ones while everyone else is some random adventurer we know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I think it did get cancelled. I hope they just show us things online or with special live letters instead. I think that would be nice and easier on the team</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm hype. So curious about the future of the series. Wondering how they top shadowbringers. I honestly feel like we might get another pretty okay expansion like stormblood before we get another amazing one</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What should I be doing!?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 07:41:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lol I love pso2! Been waiting literally freaking years for the game and I got now! With steam I am so [satisfied.Now](https://satisfied.Now) new genesis is coming out and these video games are starting to look a lot like their cinematic trailers! That's crazy! That being said. What the heck am I supposed to be doing to progress? I am at level 61. Should I actually be doing the story? I've done quite a bit of it but still on episode 1 and its nice to get star gems but there is so much content I'm kinda confused on my goal lol</TEXT>
