    <TITLE>Who was that guy? (Furiosa's second-in-command)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-05 21:51:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been reading through the Mad Max wiki, and I've noticed that there seems to be no information about Furiosa's apparent second-in-command (the guy who hangs off the door of the war rig at the start of her escape). Nothing on Google, either, and I can't even see a credit for him on IMDb (I'm guessing his name was "Gru" or something similar, judging by what Nux shouted when he tried to shoot Furiosa). Any ideas if this character even had a name, and what his story might have been? Surely I can't be the only one to have been fascinated by him!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing that really drove this home for me was when I went to see it for the second time. While I don't have epilepsy, strobes and flashes still make me uncomfortable due to sensory issues, so I had my eyes shut for a lot of the storm sequence the first time around. When it had ended, I was a little lost over what was going on for a short while. The second time I saw this film I decided to try and watch all of that scene, and found that I'd missed quite a huge chunk of the story simply by not looking for that minute or so, despite the fact that I could still hear everything. (And I agree with the others here; the visual storytelling and refusal to rely on dialogue and exposition makes this film even more fantastic.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been looking for a video I saw years ago that popped up on Youtube (close to the early days of the site) simply called "Youtubers" and featuring a compilation of early Youtube celebrities and vlogs. I seem to remember it being around 11 minutes long with some melancholy piano music in the background, and I remember it featuring clips of lonelygirl15 and geriatric1927 in particular. It was quite popular at the time, and I clearly remember it being featured on a few news sites. Does anyone else remember it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dropped my phone yesterday and cracked the screen, and I'm planning on taking it to be repaired tomorrow. I was going to take it back to Carphone Warehouse, where I originally got it, and apparently their repairs are covered by Geek Squad, who charge anything from  #163;60 to  #163;200 depending on the Samsung model. Has anyone else here taken their S7 to them to have the screen replaced, and if so, could you please let me know roughly how much it cost? It'd be good to know in advance whether to go straight to them or find somewhere a bit more affordable first (or at least have an opportunity to brace myself for the huge chunk in my bank account after this!)</TEXT>

It turns out it was made back in 2006, and so the snapshot you get of Youtube through this is very different to what it is today - less of a huge media platform filled with online celebrities and production companies and more of a tight-knit community.

    <TITLE>Looking for orchestral copyright-free music</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-18 16:04:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been looking for copyright-free music for my streams (I've been mostly playing soundtracks to movies and games, but of course they still get flagged and muted as VODs) but the only Twitchfm music I can find is almost entirely techno, which doesn't really fit my art streams, plus I'm just not that into it. I'd love to find something orchestral to draw along to, but aside from old classical music there seems to be nothing out there - in particular, anything that sounds like it belongs in a movie or could have been released by Two Steps From Hell would be ideal. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was thinking about this the other day, oddly. I'm a moderator in a few channels as well as a streamer, and while I enjoy streaming I feel even more passionate about modding. I've come to the conclusion that it's the same reason I used to be a stage hand for an amateur dramatic company - I love working behind the scenes to support creativity, and there's something very satisfying about knowing that I'm able to keep negativity and trolls out of chat, offer the streamer a helping hand when they need it and generally help things run smoothly. As for those who seem to beg to be a mod the moment they come into a chat, I agree that it's probably for the status, but wanting to be a moderator when you know the responsibilities is all about being able to help and knowing that you're supporting someone's creativity, at least in my case.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about wearing glasses with the Vive</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-17 14:39:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've found several posts about similar topics, but they all seem to cover wearing the headset without glasses, or with inserts, so I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out whether I could successfully wear glasses with a Vive. I've been saving up to buy one, but I'm shortsighted with astigmatism (20/200 vision without glasses) and need my glasses to see, and I can't wear contact lenses. I have a Samsung Gear VR that fits around my glasses just fine, so with that in mind, would I be able to wear glasses in the Vive without issues?

    <TEXT>I'm thinking of buying this skirt from Joe Brown's for a family party, but I'm utterly new to fashion (my idea of being stylish has always been wearing a t-shirt other than black with my jeans) and I have no idea what it'd look good with. As it's online with no shops near me that sell Joe Brown's, I can't try it on in person with anything, either. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I could wear? Anything with sleeves and without an exposed back would be a good start (scars and generally bad skin on my back that I'd prefer to keep covered, plus in this weather I'd rather not wear a cami top) and too much red isn't a great idea thanks to my rosacea, but besides that I'm open to suggestions. I'm thinking of wearing the skirt with some black tights and ankle boots (the "Cute to Boot" ones from the same site) if that helps - I'm hoping for a nice autumnal look if possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Of course, now I'm terrified about things like sepsis. I've just put some Savlon on the area, but I can't stop shaking and panicking.

    <TEXT>I've been reading a lot about starting threads using loop starts lately (as in doubling a single thread and looping the needle to anchor your first stitch) but the one time I've tried it, I ended up wasting a lot more thread than I usually do thanks to the amount left unusable once I'd finished the section and cut the thread. Does anyone have any suggestions, or any alternative start methods?

    <TEXT>The best two things I can suggest are life drawing, and taking note of what you particularly like about other character designs to help kick-start your own inspiration. Drawing daily is great, too! Practice is everything! :) (Seriously, compare your drawings at the start and end of a week, and you'll already see so much improvement) PS: If you don't have any life drawing classes near you, look up sites such as Line of Action and SketchDaily to let you do it for free online. Or if you want to practice drawing bodies in motion, one of my recent favourite exercises has been to find a music video with plenty of dancing, pause it at random intervals and roughly sketch the dancers mid-dance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had my first go at archery today, at a "have a go" display at a Viking festival. I have dyspraxia (coordination and fine motor skill disorder, for anyone unaware) and I'm hypermobile, but the instructors there were great and very accommodating, and I had a lot of fun despite my difficulties with it. I'd love to take it further and sign up for classes, but I'm aware that given the difficulty I had using a bow, holding it up for that long and trying to aim, I'll probably need some further help, at least at first. Does anyone here have any tips for taking up archery with a disability like mine, and would many archery clubs be willing and able to take on newbies who have more difficulties with aiming and general movement than most?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much to everyone who commented and gave advice/encouragement - I took the plunge and got in contact with my local archery club, and I've been invited to come over, check the place out and talk with the instructors about my disabilities and how they can best help me. And I've already picked out the model of bow I want as my first (a WNS Forged Elite Alpha) and set a tentative date for when I start lessons.  #128515; Thank you so much, I'm still a bit nervous, but I feel much more reassured now.</TEXT>

I'll be playing the campaign in the next few weeks, and the character I had in mind is a Goliath barbarian to act as the party's tank/heavy hitter.

What exercises do you recommend to condition myself a bit more for holding up a bow for that long (keeping in mind that I have basically no exercise equipment other than a couple of small weights that I bought for this and no access to a gym) and how should I warm up  amp; cool down before and after shooting to minimise pain?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to Song Facts: (https://www.songfacts.com/facts/the-foundations/build-me-up-buttercup) "There was a scene in a Red Dwarf episode, that this song was played for a musical montage type flashback" Maybe something that was shown in whichever episode this was when it first aired, then was taken out later due to copyright? The same thing happened with Being Human (an Alabama 3 song played during a scene in the original broadcast, and was replaced with standard music on DVD) so it could be a case of the same thing happening here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could be played in a different part/episode of the show that others may have remembered it from? The assumption that it's really Tongue Tied seems to stem from that being the first song that people jump to when they think of Red Dwarf - if it's from a montage, it could maybe be from a different episode, or even something like a Smeg Ups compilation. Either way, I'm curious now and rather determined to find this for myself!</TEXT>

I'm two weeks into lessons, and in a square stance with the corner of my mouth as my anchor point, the arrow appears diagonal and I'm lucky if I can hit my target at all instead of the back wall (I shoot left-handed and have even tried shutting my right eye to make sure I'm aiming right, and I don't think it's any sort of fear of the string - I try to keep it pressed into my face as much as possible when aiming). I've tried moving my bow arm forwards a bit, drawing an imaginary line from the arrow to the target, etc. but still no luck. I feel like there must be a trick to this that I'm just not seeing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Target quiver recommendations?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-25 20:34:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now that Christmas has been and gone, I've been thinking of what to do with the money I've been given by family members, and have decided to treat myself to my first quiver. I'm hoping to get a target quiver that isn't going to be too heavy after wearing it all day (I've given myself a bad knee before from carrying too much weight on one side, and I'd rather not do it again) available for a left-handed shooter, and my budget is up to  #163;60. I'm still new enough that I'm not sure which brands/models are the most reliable, so any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. I've been looking at the redesigned Avalon Tec One target quiver, so if anyone here can tell me if they're any good, that'd be amazing too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use Uni Posca paint pens to draw the designs onto it :) The two pieces of advice I'd give are to paint several layers, as it absorbs into the fabric quickly and needs to build up (a hairdryer on a low setting can help a lot, as the faster it dries the less it seems to absorb) and spray it with a sealer such as Scotchgard when it's done to protect the design for outdoor shooting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, but only use Scotchgard once it's finished and completely dry. That's more a protective layer than anything (and optional if you're shooting indoors only, it just gives that extra bit of protection). The most important thing is just adding more layers as each dries.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When to start using stabilisers?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-15 02:56:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been shooting recurve weekly for around a couple of months now; I'm still finding my feet, and last Sunday at my club my arm was moving around a lot, so I asked to borrow a stabiliser rod to try out. Immediately my shots got much worse - my arm kept dropping, and I was missing the target a lot before finally settling around 1s and 2s. I thought of leaving it for now, but I do want to get used to using a stabiliser system, particularly as I want to get into competitive target recurve. Is it better to get it out of the way and adapt to using a stabiliser sooner rather than later, or should I leave it until I'm a more confident archer with better form?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for all the help; I think I might wait a bit longer before trying a stabiliser rod again. I'm admittedly not that strong yet, and as I don't have my form completely down anyway I feel like the extra weight won't exactly do me any good just yet. It may have just been that I was having an off day anyway (which I was) and would be more comfortable with them when things are going more smoothly, but it could also be that I need to build up more strength and work on my form. It's always possible to loan them from my club, so I'll do that again in a few weeks/months and see if I'm any more comfortable making that transition then. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It can vary wildly depending on the show - factors such as how difficult the costume is to take off, other tasks they may have to do backstage, waiting for friends and just feeling too tired/not in the mood for being social can all affect this, and there's no guarantee that an actor won't just leave straight away (most will stick around if they're not in a rush, though). The best advice I can offer is to hope for the best while expecting the worst, and to prioritise maybe two or three actors that you're particularly eager to see. Waiting around for hours to get every last autograph isn't fun, so it's often best to pick the ones you're most desperate for and be prepared to call it a day once you've got them even if you're missing other autographs, or once you've gotten confirmation that you won't realistically be getting them.</TEXT>

I wasn't sure what they were (this is my first sight, and it came without any sort of instructions) so I put them aside ready to ask about them at the club. Today it turns out that a family member mistook them for rubbish (I'd kept them in the packaging for safekeeping) and threw them out. So my questions are what were they, were they vital for using the sight and do I need to contact Avalon for replacements?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently using an Avalon Classic soft case for my recurve bow - it's fine, but carrying that much weight on one shoulder gets a bit painful after a while, so I'm thinking of switching to a backpack. My budget isn't great, so I'm thinking of either an Avalon Classic backpack or an Easton Club XT one. I've seen a couple of reviews mentioning the Avalon Classic's fabric splitting along with many more great reviews, and none for the Easton backpack. Does anyone here have experience with either, and can you recommend either one or another in the same price range that's available in the UK? I'd prefer one with enough space for my extra bits and pieces, having to deal with typical women's jean pockets and not really wanting to keep bringing my bag with my bow bag.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Aluminium risers that aren't too heavy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-06 16:58:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>After a fair bit of saving up, I can finally afford my first aluminium recurve riser  amp; limbs (I've been shooting a wooden Ragim Matrix Evo until now). I'm aware that the higher weight will be a huge help in keeping my bow arm steady, but as I have hypermobile joints I have to be careful that it's not too heavy, otherwise my elbow's just going to bend backwards or sideways under the weight - I had a brief hold of another club member's Hoyt bow a while ago to see how an aluminium riser felt and immediately had this issue. Building up my arm muscles should help support my joints a bit more, so I'm working on that, but any suggestions for slightly lighter aluminium risers would be a huge help. (Preferably for an entry-level budget!)</TEXT>

My first new bow string arrived today (the other came with the bow) and I bought some nocking thread with it, then had the realisation that I do not trust my hands to be steady enough not to burn the string itself, or if I manage to avoid that bit then I'm worried about the possibility of the flame reaching the string anyway before I can blow it out. So is this step necessary and should I stop being a wuss, or is there an alternative I can try?</TEXT>

My cat was sprawled on the sofa, watching this mouse but quite content to do nothing at all about it (this mouse was the cheekiest thing I've ever met, too, and would sit there until I walked over to it, then waddle away just out of reach again). In the end I caught it with a glass bowl and a bit of cake as bait to drop it off in a field the next village over - my cat, helpful mouser that he is, decided that I had everything under control and took a nap for most of this, and the mouse seemed just as happy to sit there eating cake in his temporary home.

    <TEXT>It's surprisingly good. :) The bow is 20lbs and 56", and the arrows fit on my regular recurve's serving perfectly, so I've been able to shoot them from my usual bow at home. The target is a little small, but it has holes in the base that allow it to be screwed to a wall for eye-level shooting (it's currently attached to the shed wall). I'd just recommend using duct tape to fix the target to the base if you do that. The bow that comes with it isn't perfect, but it is ambidextrous and fine if you have younger family members who want to shoot. Overall, I'd say it's a good investment for practicing at home. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Warping frame looms with rotating warp bars for long weaves?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-11 20:16:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm completely new to weaving, and for my first loom I bought a peg loom with rotating warp bars. I'd love to make a scarf with it, and was wondering if there's a way I could warp it with threads longer than the loom itself to wind up. Could I warp it up for that without getting completely uneven tension?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the loom in question: https://www.bergeredefrance.com/wooden-weaving-loom-31-cm-x-45-cm-bergere-de-france.html I've had a go at some practice-projects and it seems good so far - the wingnuts and rotating warp bars are great for taking the finished weave off easily :) I know there must be a way to use it like the scroll frames I embroider on, I just haven't figured it out!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That could actually work - thank you, I'll try that :) I originally thought of cutting individual warp threads of the same length, but then tying the knots exactly the same could be tricky. This could be a much better way, at least until I can move somewhere with the space for a rigid heddle loom! (Dear lord, they look fun...)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For Father's Day this year I'm going to be folding Miyamoto Chuya's Grim Reaper as a gift for my dad (a huge Discworld fan, so I figured he'd enjoy an origami model of Death) and I'm going to be using tissue foil. I'd like to harden and preserve it, but I have no idea how well varnish would work on the foil. Has anyone else here varnished or otherwise preserved tissue foil models, and could anyone here please give advice on how to do this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've loved it :) My plan was to visit my nearest shop before the lockdown started to upgrade to a metal riser, but honestly after thinking it over I decided to leave it for now. I'm enjoying the Matrix Evo too much, and it has the bushings for my sight and stabiliser already, so I'm fine for that. The two potential downsides are that it isn't ILF and from what I remember, I think the maximum poundage may not be as high as others (I'll have to double check that) but if you're a beginner or just shoot a lower draw weight as I do, it's a lovely and very smooth bow to shoot. I've gotten a few compliments in my club over how it looks, too!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any advice for transporting a strung recurve?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 21:32:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>My club is finally opening back up for socially distanced shoots, and one of the new rules is that archers must arrive ready to shoot and leave as soon as they're finished. This isn't going to give me much time at all to set up my bow, and either way I'd rather spend as little time as possible there when I'm not actively shooting to minimise any health risks to myself or others. So does anyone here have any recommendations for bags/cases that I could use to transport my 66" recurve strung and as ready to go as is possible, particularly one that I could buy in the UK? (If there's space in there for my sight to be already attached, even better)</TEXT>
