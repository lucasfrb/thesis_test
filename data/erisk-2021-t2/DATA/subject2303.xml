    <TEXT>So that the game ends early and the person who quit is able to search a new game sooner as well? I disagree. Their should be at least some kind of consequence otherwise everybody who has a bad game might as well just leave and hope their team surrenders or wait the 20 minutes to hop into the next game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With  #8222;allow leavers to be replaced mid-match #8220; you mean some other random is gonna join that game? Who would want to join a game which is already half way done. And tbh I think if you start a game you should be able to play the whole thing. If you don #8216;t have enough time then don #8216;t search for one because you are ruining the game for your teammates. Everybody has bad games with bad teammates or insane skill leveled enemies, that doesn #8216;t justify you leaving the game and letting your teammates down. After all it is a team game. I agree though that the punishment right now shouldn #8216;t be bad or maybe removed at all because it is a beta and there are still bugs and errors that make your game crash. After full release there needs to be a consequence for leaving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But tbh if you can wait 1h (even if that seems pretty long for one match) and then instantly queue again after that you could have just played the game until the end. Even if it didn #8216;t go well. So I still think that at least after the full release of Valorant there needs to be a consequence for leaving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well if you quit in League of Legends you get a leave buster, for 5 games you have to wait 20 minutes before you can queue. So you play, you quit, next time you want to queue you have to wait 20 minutes and that five times. Considering LoL is made by Riot as well you can expect a smiliar harsh treatment. Also I am not saying you should get an hour ban for just leaving one time. If it happens more often though you definetly should.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You mean like buying service for that phone or connecting that phone to my WiFi and then connecting my host machine to the phone? Because where I live service isn #8216;t cheap and for example having unlimited data would cost 60 bucks a month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk if you even read my post. It seems like you think I wanna act like a dark net vendor or some badass hacker but as I said I just like the fucking topic and in my freetime I am reading about it. I said nothing about me being some big online gangster who knows everything about privacy these days, infact I even asked a question about online privacy. You abused this post to act like you are the big guy with all the knowledge about the topic and tried to expose me for being a newbie. Well congrats to you, you really showed me who is the cool guy with all the knowledge around here! Also about your pay-to-go phone method (you are probably just referring to a prepaid phone, but for whatever reason are not using that name). It isn #8216;t that hard to get tracked through that method. They check the cell towers and of course they dont get your exact location but they get an area where you could be. Now they have equipment for example antennas with which they can pick up WiFi signals very far away. They drive through the streets of traced area and suddenly the get the signal from your phone and thus now where you are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing with the mac adress was important to me because I thought that if you for example use a VPN today and connect to a starbucks WiFi and use a different VPN tomorrow at a different Starbucks but with the same MAC they can still link that connection to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aight thats cool, I am sorry for my reply earlier. As I said I am just interested in these kind of things as a hobby, nothing really serious and no big motivation behind it. You gave me some things to look into though, thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8216;s all good. But another serious question: The way I mentioned about tracking that phone WiFi hotspot.. in my head it seems like a possible way to track it. Probably you would have to waste a lot of ressources but is it possible that way? Or was it really that dumb?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just read that you were using Tails, network problems with Tails are pretty common, as stated on their website. I recommend reading their troubleshooting part on networking issues. No you are not under attack. You haven #8216;t posted anything on .onion sites so you are simply not relevant enough for anyone to waste their ressources on you and for LE you don #8216;t matter even if you visited illegal sites, as long as it isn #8216;t child p*rn.</TEXT>
