    <TEXT>Hearthstone is slowly chipping away MTGO. I do not play either of them, but I hope MTGO fails. If this will not happen, in the future there will be a risk to play more legacy online than the paper. In vintage this thing already seems to happen. Yes, this is a comment to complain about the Reserved List.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of words, a lacks of initiatives. Do not get me wrong: I love when someone talks about the Reserved List, because it is something that should be discussed ALWAYS. With internet, we can: 1) do a crowfounding campaign in order to try a legal action with the help of some lawyers that LOVE this game; 2) do a petition; 3) speak more often of the Reserved List to maximize attention. We are a motivated but messy army. Who seriously want to do something with me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With the realease of Eternal Masters, the discussions about the Reserved List appear to be increased and this is very good. I don't want to talk of why the Reserved List is an error that must be fixed as soon as possibile, but this year seems to provide a great support for eternal formats (Eternal Masters, Conspiracy: Take the Crown, From The Vault: Lore and Commander 2016). My question is this: even if you can not speak to us of the Reserved List, do you still talk about it when you are at work?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm 22 years old and I've broke my BlackBerry PRIV, trying to open it to avoid the reboot. I don't know a phone like that can't be opened, because I've formerly used low price phones that I could open to remove the battery to solve all problems. I love this phone, even if I'm too young to be a BlackBerry lover. I love his physical QWERTY keyboard and I bought it used at a very good price. The problem is that while trying to open it, I broke the lateral buttons of volume and pause. The entire part must be substituted, according to the man who sold it to me (he repairs phones from a lot of years). The spare parts are a big problem. Where I can find them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that Abrupt Decay is too good to be substituted by Swords to Plowshares. Don't forget: Aluren is not only a combo deck. It is great in the late game and it can win even without the combo. Your opponents will keep their counterspells while you cast creatures like Deathrite Shaman or Parasitic Strix. I don't know if white will be a better color. You can simply swap Imperial Recruiter with Recruiter of the Guard, the Taiga with a Savannah and Dream Stalker with Arctic Merfolk. I prefer the version with red because Dream Stalker is good to stall the board against Tarmogoyf or Batterskull and it can bounce your Aluren if someone tries a Golgari Charm. If you haven't enough money for Imperial Recruiter, you can try the white version. The most interesting part from the white version could be the sideboard options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the deck although now I'm only playing Aluren. I want to share some things to know based on my experience. 1) If a creature is equipped with Sword of Fire and Ice and Painter's Servant naming "blue" or "red" is on the battlefield, that creature loses the equipment. This is true even if Painter's Servant enters on the battlefield when the creature is already equipped. 2) Humility does not affect Painter's Servant ability, no matter who came first to the battlefield. 3) Cuddle the deck to have more feeling with it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-19 13:56:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few months ago we all saw a bad phenomenon that has rocked our community, especially those who wanted to start playing Legacy or who was already a player of this fantastic format: **the Reserved List buyouts**. I remember that one of the people involved in these buyouts announced that there would be other. If I remember correctly he was the man behind the buyout of Lion's Eye Diamond. **Even the trolling of Martin Shkreli** was a part of this "buyouts phenomenon". I know that all this was also due to the release of Eternal Masters, but **now the buyouts seem to have stood**. It's clear that *the Reserved List was an error and today it lost its original purpose*. Seems that the cards in the Reserved List have become a bad investment even for those who made money through it in the past, maybe for the lack of demands. If so, **this is another point in favor of the abolishment of the Reserved List**.</TEXT>

I think the same thing. **I don't buy booster packs even if I love booster drafts and sealed decks, because I don't want to pay Wizards of the Coast if they don't support the format I love**. I don't want one Legacy Grand Prix each month, but only a more accessible format to play with more people, **without the Reserved List**. Fortunately, where I play there is a good legacy community. I buy from the secondary market, in order to give as less as possible money to who make this game. **I'm sorry but it's one of the way to make this fight**.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Criticizing Starcitygames is the wrost thing to do.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-01 12:15:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have read several critical to the changes of Starcitygames. Recently they are giving less and less support for the Legacy. The problem, however, is not Starcitygames. We are in 2016, twenty years after the birth of the Reserved List and six years since its last change. Incredibly, the Starcitygame's announcement was made in the same year of the realease of Eternal Masters and other supplemental products. In the same year the Wizards of the Coast announced the decrease of the Grand Prix Legacy. **The Reserved List was born in a totally different time than today**, and for various reasons did not make sense to exist. Let's see what are the communication strategies about the Reserved List: * it is characterized by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), then one can not speak in detail; * any attempt to talk about it generates the same stereotypical answer that I will not repeat here because it makes me an absurd anger; * it is described as immutable and necessary, but it has changed repeatedly over time, so that **the original Reserved List is profoundly different from today**. There you are removing slowly the Legacy and you are not doing anything to change. Got to this point, perhaps the Legacy deserves to die. Here we are not playing the "blame game" but the fault probably is not even the Wizards of the Coast. Mark Roserwater has admitted several times that the Reserved List is a mistake and if it were up to him he would never have made birth. Before it's too late, an action is needed. **Starcitygames and others are really so irrelevant?** Why not organize themselves to discuss it and make a proposal? For myself, if I could not play legacy, I never would move on to other formats, but directly to another game. I leave you with a little news: **WikiLeaks has already released in the past the information on Hasbro, I'm surprised there are not yet on the Reserved List**.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have enough money, you can start with Legacy, but it's one of the most difficult formats. It is more expensive than Modern. Legacy is beautiful and for a lot of players is the best format. I've played also other formats, but Legacy is the only one I play right now. If you're in a place where Legacy is supported, try it, even with proxies or ask to someone a deck to borrow. In my personal opinion, Modern is a shitty format. It was born only to replace Legacy due to the Reserved List problem and because people did not like the latest changes made to the Extended format. Search the Legacy decks from the last Eternal Weekend, you will be surprised of how fantastic is this format! Vintage is also beautiful, but is inaccesible!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Reserved List was first published on 4 March 1996, as a response to the protests against **Chronicles and Fourth Edition**. During the years, the Reserved List is changed. The last and the **worst** revision was in 2010: if this had not happened, probably today we would have seen Masterpieces dual lands. I know that there is a lot of hype for Modern Master 2017, but I want to remember to all players that, at least until today, the Reserved List is **the unresolved mistake**. I hope we will see snow or legendary dual lands before it's too late.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think so. If at least one of your Commanders is in your Command Zone, you can only use the colorless mana ability. It will be good for snow Commanders, because these lands are not too powerfull. For Eternal players, these are just dual lands. You can also make them legendary and then print a similar cycle: for example, they can enter the battlefield tapped if at least one Commander is in the Command Zone. We have **a lot** of solutions, I'm waiting for them. Sorry for my bad English, I'm Italian.

I prefer to side out Etched Champion. - Against some decks you side out both the Lotus Petal, but you may side out a Karakas instead of the second Lotus Petal. - Why you sided out Etched Champion against UW Stoneblade? I think it is our "True Name Nemesis"! You sided out Umezawa's Jitte too, but why? - You never played against Miracles during the tournament. How do you feels against the deck? Back to Basics is the big reason why Steel Stompy needs green. I'm curious to know you sideboarding strategy against Miracles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Problems with the Swamp Thing's Growth-related power stunt</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-05 21:44:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I will be the GM of a DC Adventures group and one of my players want to play Swamp Thing as a character. In comics he rarely manifested the ability to become immense, so I want to power stunt is Plant Control array (45 points) to reflect this ability, using his PL 15 as a limit to build the power stunt. This is my idea: **Growth 13, Linked to Sustained Protection 1, Linked to Enhanced Advantage Improved Grab, Linked to Impervious Thoughness 17, stacks with Impervious 12**. In this way, he has 29 in Thoughness, 1 in active defenses, and +8 for an attack check that deals 22 damages. The problem is that his Fortitude wil break the PL, in fact his Fortitude and Will are 15 each before apply any modifiers from this power stunt. What can I do in this situation? Are there some ways to weaken the Fortitude, like a "reverse Enhanced Fortitude"? What are your advices?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-12 13:52:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Updating the previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mutantsandmasterminds/comments/ekjie3/problems_with_the_swamp_things_growthrelated/) with some progress in the making of these power stunts, based on a 45 points array, for Swamp Thing from DC Adventures "Heroes  amp; Villains Vol. 2". # Giant form  gt;**Growth 13 Linked to Enhanced Toughess 1, Reduced Fortitude 13**; Impervious Toughness 17 **(stacks with Impervious Toughness 12)**; **Reach 2 on Unarmed attacks**; Movement (Slithering); Movement 3 (Permeate), Limited to Vegetation; Enhanced Advantage Improved Grab; Enhanced Advantage Fast Grab; Enhanced Advantage Chockehold; Enhanced Advantage Power Attack; Enhanced Advantage Instant Up; Enhanced Advantage Prone Fighting; Enhanced Advantage Startle; Enhanced Advantage Power Attack. I need to know if the bold parts of this power stunt are ok by the rules. For example, I don't know if some problems related to fraction costs can occour: do Linked powers work like a single power? **Here will be some explanations** Enhanced Toughness instead of Sustained Protection is just a way to have access to the Reduced Trait flaw, in order to keep under this character the PL limits. In the Gadgets and Gear section I've read that Protection is the same of Enhanced Toughness, so I think it's ok by the rules, expecially for this case. The Movement (Slithering), the Enhanced Advantage Instant Up and the Enhanced Advantage Prone Fighting represent the capability of Swamp Thing of having a more complex physiognomy when he is giant, [as you can see in the last panels from this fight](https://comicnewbies.com/2016/12/01/superman-vs-swamp-thing-rebirth/). I will appreciate thoughts about the other part of this stunt, and if they are ok by the rules. # Battlesuit  gt;Enhanced Strenght 2; Enhanced Fighting 7; Impervious Toughness 3 (stacks with Impervious Toughness 12); Enhanced Dodge 7; Flight 1 , Winged; Variable 1 (vegetable extention from the body), free action, Limited to vegetal Improvised Weapons (5 points); Enhanced Advantage Startle; Enhanced Advantage Power Attack; Enhanced Advantage Improvised Weapons; Enhanced Advantage Improved Critical 4 (vegetal Improvised Weapons); Instant Up. **Here will be some explanations** Swamp Thing manifested the power to assume a ["battle-oriented" form](https://www.google.com/search?sa=G amp;hl=it amp;tbs=simg:CAQSsgIJA4Gb0a1f9kEapgILELCMpwgaYgpgCAMSKMoexR7cC-AXvBfNHrYXzh7GHskeuCzrKbUs7CmBJPMtgiSTOOUphCQaMFxtL5crQwxKkIHMkyrs5EZlmoQlpQih1X6QRCT7EijmOwc7lIVFYqUil4DfAVReSiAEDAsQjq7-CBoKCggIARIE_18-6KQwLEJ3twQkangEKGQoGY29taWNz2qWI9gMLCgkvbS8wMTJoMjQKHAoKY29taWMgYm9va9qliPYDCgoIL20vMDF2bmIKGQoHY2FydG9vbtqliPYDCgoIL20vMDIxNW4KJwoTZmljdGlvbmFsIGNoYXJhY3RlctqliPYDDAoKL20vMDJoN2xrdAofCgxpbGx1c3RyYXRpb27apYj2AwsKCS9tLzAxa3I4Zgw amp;q=dc+comics+swamp+thing+fly amp;tbm=isch amp;ved=2ahUKEwilpee6kv7mAhWPDOwKHcW0D1MQ2A4oAXoECAcQLw amp;biw=1280 amp;bih=913#imgrc=nGiEpiPhvO6GwM:) during the new 52 and he is capable of generating weapons, represented by the Variable 1 power. This form is the most balanced, because he have 15 to attack check, damage and defenses, even if a 16-20 critical may be too much powerful. Weapons can be like: **4 Strenght-based damage, Reach 1**, choosing the type of damage (bludgeoning, piercing or slashing) when he make them. I'm thinking even to make an improvised whip, so I need some advices. # What's next? I need some advices for the power of making clones for an attack, as you can see [here](https://comicnewbies.com/2016/12/01/superman-vs-swamp-thing-rebirth/).</TEXT>

Non parlo semplicemente del fatto che siano giochi sopravvalutati: non puoi sopravvalutare ci #242; che, di base, non vale nulla. Io parlo proprio dell'incapacit #224; del giocatore di ruolo moderno medio di non riuscire ad andare oltre quei pochi titoli (spesso uno o due) coi quali hanno iniziato. Nonostante siano pieni di pagine di regole inutili, complesse e superate da almeno un decennio, purtroppo vedo ancora gente ostinarsi ad adattare tali sistemi di gioco ad avventure che meriterebbero altri titoli per poter sfruttare al massimo l'interpretazione e la narrazione. Io sono un appassionato del Cortex Plus System, ma credo che una proposta come quella del post vada bene anche per il Fate Core System, o molti altri giochi di ruolo anche pi #249; di nicchia.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I use a Koraat smile razor as my first cut-throat razor?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 19:30:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am about to begin my first journey into the world of freehand razors. In addition to being a fascinating world, my goal is to eliminate the concept of "disposable" and "mass-production" which unfortunately also concern the world of safety razors. I also want to really get the most out of the shaving experience. In light of this, I would like to gather various opinions and experiences. I'd like to take a Koraat. They sell the Basic II, a near wedge razor with a slightly smile blade and they say it is for beginners; all at a fairly cheap price. I would like a near wedge because they fascinate me, I consider them truly traditional razors, and I think it is the right grinding for my hard beard. You can find it [here](http://www.koraat-knives.at/english/seite23.html). But here comes the doubts. Some people said me that smile razors are not recommended for beginners like me, and they require a different stropping technique. You can see an example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqqrVi2u05w amp;feature=youtu.be amp;list=PLhicNXLVkonzHswtLjfQpOfDHgDe4jUYG amp;t=228) by Mastro Livi, with English subtitles as well, at 3:50. He uses a little strop in the video but he does the same movement on larger strops as well. The razor he uses is not a smiling razor. Is this the right movement to do with a smiling razor too? Koraat are razors with a really slight smiling edge, but anyway... People recommend me to start with a vintage razor, but as for now I wasn't able to find a 50-100  #8364; old razor honed by someone who is considered good here in Italy. And I want a near wedge razor. What do you think about? Can I start from a Koraat? Is the stropping technique with smile razor all that troublesome? I'm in an e-mail communication with the producer, but I want to know your exeperience as well, and if any of you started from a Koraat or from a similar razor.</TEXT>

One to re-align the blade after you #8217;ve shaved, and one to occasionally sharpen. I already know that.

    <TEXT>You can try a combo or you can try a combo with a B-plan (combo with style). In the first case, you can try ANT, TES, Doomsday. I don't like storm decks because they become repetitive over the time. In the second case, you can try Aluren, Food Chain, Paradigm Merfolk or my favourite: Painter. There are so many versions of Painter. I'm currently playing Rw Jegatha Painter. The deck is a combo, but it can win with creatures (even if it's not a common thing for this deck) and also with lock cards. I suggest you Painter, Emry Urza Echo or Bomberman if you like artifacts, and the combination of lock  amp; combo, because I doubt you ever tried this playstyle. I've not mentioned all the option you have, because other users have already given you other good examples.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is MTGO good for Legacy or it will become a substitute to the paper play?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-07 15:06:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm thinking to play on MTGO in the near future, but I need to know how this will impact my view about giving less money as possibile to WotC, in particularly to Hasbro, that maybe is the real problem behind the Reserved List and other controversial MTG themes. A little more context below. Some years after the 2010's Reserved List revision, I decided to don't buy any of the sealed product from WotC anymore (even if I love Limited). I also decided to play only Legacy (and more recently, also Pauper) and to don't play to any of their console games. I was (and I am also today) frustrated due to the buyouts and their consequences, so I decided to limit at the minimum my "financial support" to WotC. I'm lucky enough to have a growing or at least stable Legacy community in my areas: it's maybe the southernmost Legacy community in Italy (even if it's in the Center Italy), so you can understand that my not-buying choices are motivated to a particular affection to the format and to what it represents for me, my memories and the community of which I'm a member. I tried XMage and I feel it's better than Cockatrice due to the rules enforcement, but I wanna play in a more competitive environment. What stops me is the question in the title.  #8203; MTGO seems good because: \- it's a good resource to watch the metagame health and evolution; \- if Legacy is popular on MTGO, [then WotC could think about some solutions to the biggest problem of the format](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/155088955703/a-lot-of-people-are-talking-about-this-after-the) (I'm speculating in these days about legendary enemy colored duals in Commander Legends with an added rules text that's unrelevant in non-Commander format, but it's a baseless speculation).  #8203; MTGO could be bad because: \- it could become the almost only place to play Legacy, like what happened to Vintage; \- I prefer to give as less as possible money to Hasbro. Yes, I know that a lot of WotC's employees hate the Reserved List and tried to get rid of it before 2010 (From the Vault: Relics is an example), but this isn't enough for me. EDIT: **I know that money is not directly given to Hasbro. I'm talking about how the secondary market influences the demands from sealed products. This is how Hasbro gains.**  #8203; I'm simply asking for your opinion to start a nice discussion about this theme.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;increased play and visibility online can only increase interest in paper. This could be a possibility, but I don't think it's a certainty. Reserved List limits the number of players. You can play poker with few money if you want to. You can do the same thing also with Legacy, but the risk is to not being competitive enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it possible to test a new feature that gives players the opportunity to meet each other like on MTGO Leagues? I don't know if it's legal. I'm talking about a server that has the feature to play with other players choosen at random, for a maximum of 5 matches, with a little entry fee and some prizes, maybe coupons to use in an online marketplace that sponsors the "XMage League". Players pay the entry fee for each format, that lasts an entire week. At the end of the week, they can redeem prizes based on their results in each league. I don't know if MTGO's Leagues work like this. Once a month there would be a Challenge for each format (or maybe two of them per format, so players from different nations can play) with a bigger entry fee and bigger prizes, that starts and ends the same day, or that lasts for more than one day in order to give "busy" players the chance to play if they can't dedicate too much hours a day to the game. If this idea can work, we need also an internal regulation. For example, using Cockatrice to end the match if there is a bug during the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't buy sealed products and I don't play on MTGA or MTGO. I play only Legacy and sometimes Pauper. This is the amount of "financial support" WotC has from me if they continue to keep the Reserved List. Some years ago I saw the consequences of the Reserved List, so I decided to stop drafting and playing the more supported formats. However, don't forget that they tried, years ago, to get rid of the Reserved List. I know a lot of players are angry about WotC, but we can keep a civil discussion and make our voice be eared.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually, opinions regarding the future of the Reserved List from random redditors are not welcomed here. However, the RL it's a very frustrating topic for a lot of players and, in my opinion, it should be discussed daily to raise the interest and keeping the focus on the RL problem. Personally, I play only Legacy and a bit of Pauper, I don't buy sealed products and I don't play on MTGO and MTGA. These are choices I made as a form of protest against RL. Back in 2010 there was at least one meeting at WotC to talk about the future of the RL. It was reported in Stacitygames articles and it's not a secret. Why big sellers and GP organizers don't team up to make their voices be eared again by WotC? Discuss again the RL can't be embarrassing if compared to Double Master flawed VIP packages, Jumpstart mass misprints and other terrible choices WotC has made during the last years.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Urza Echo discussion?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 17:21:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm testing Urza Echo because I can buy into it and it's really fun, but I haven't found an active discussion about the deck. The Discord server is pretty dead (I'm talking about the "Urza-decks" channel on Artificer's Academy server) and I'm not able to find some players of the deck that made good results in paper and/or on MTGO. I'm testing a more anti-hate sideboard. Here's the decklist: 4 Karn, the Great Creator 4 Narset, Parter of Veils 4 Emry, Lurker of the Loch 2 Sai, Master Thopterist 4 Urza, Lord High Artificer 4 Echo of Eons 4 Chalice of the Void 3 Lion's Eye Diamond 4 Lotus Petal 4 Mox Opal 4 Urza's Bauble 4 Ancient Tomb 2 Defense Grid 2 City of Traitors 3 Island 4 Seat of the Synod 3 Snow-Covered Island 1 Minamo, School at Water's Edge  #8203; Sideboard: 1 Lion's Eye Diamond 1 Engineered Explosives 1 Ensnaring Bridge 1 Mycosynth Lattice 1 Sorcerous Spyglass 1 Tormod's Crypt 1 Walking Ballista 2 Echoing Truth 2 Dismember 4 Force of Will  #8203; I think that playing 8 post board instants (instead of the 4 that you can usually find) is way better: you have FoW against combo and prison decks, and the 4 removal/bouncing spells against Collector Ouphe, opponent's Karn, opponent's Chalice and so on. You can also combine them: for example, against prison decks you can side-in 4 FoW and 2 Echoing Truth (siding-out 2 Defense Grid and 4 Chalice of the Void). But usually, if a Urza Echo player has some removal/bouncing spells in the sideboard, they don't have FoW. Talking about bouncing spells, I've seen some people playing Brazen Borrower instead of Echoing Truth, even if Borrower is worse for the deck: you can't pick it with Narset, you may not be able to recycle it with Echo and you are unable to bounce multiple Leyline of the Void. What do you think? I feel that playing other 4 artifacts in the sideboard is not a good choice for the deck because you can't deal properly with the hate or the lock/combo decks. Also, a lot of the artifacts you can usually find in the Urza Echo's sideboards are too much situational: Liquimetal Coating, 2 other Ballistas, Mystic Forge, and so on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, Dismember is the card against creatures that lock your gameplan. I think that Dismember is good against RUG Delver because they have Collector Ouphe (siding out 2 Karns), but against UR Delver Echoing Truth is better, because you can bounce Null Rod and all Pyromancer's Elementals (again, siding out 2 Karns). Also, UR Delver maybe is too aggro to side Dismember against them. Against Eldrazi I prefer Echoing Truth to bounce Chalice on 0, Thorn of Amethyst and Leyline of the Void (siding out 2 Defense Grid). I don't think that Dismember is necessary against them: the other cards in the maindeck are better.</TEXT>

Why big sellers and GP organizers don't team up to make their voices be eared again by WotC? I've asked this to Ben Bleiweiss on Twitter, because he seems interested on discussing the RL with players, as he wrote on a recent article, but I've received no response. I'm also disappointed with content creators: you have the power to feed the RL discussion and put WotC on pressure in order to encourage them to rethink it, so why don't you coordinate with big sellers and organizers in order to have a post-pandemic plan for another WotC meeting? Talking about the RL doesn't mean to abolish it: they can "simply" find the way to be more flexible about the "spirit" concept around it, as an alternative solution. For example, they can print Legandary Dual Lands that enter untapped if you haven't casted your Commander yet. These cards can help Legacy, and then help to value other solutions on the RL during the long term. **Discuss again the RL can't be embarrassing if compared to Double Master flawed VIP packages, Jumpstart mass misprints and other terrible choices WotC has made during the last years.**</TEXT>

Not the whole RL, but only this embrassing "spirit" concept, at least for now. Even if I want the total abolition of the RL, I know that it's not possible today because it will impact the company credibility. I've made the Legendary Dual example, but they can also print a Mox Diamond limited to 3 colors and it will be perfect for almost all Legacy decks. They want to keep the RL because as is because they don't want to lost credibility as a company, but they have a lot more to gain if they rethink it. They've done far worse things that haven't had such a serious impact on their credibility as a company.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The "Alternative List" policy. A proposal on creating an advocacy group with influential personalities and stakeholders in order to keep the Reserved List, increase its value over the time but change its spirit for designing alternative cards. "This format is not for you" is bad for the game.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-14 14:39:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>[The Reserved List](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/official-reprint-policy-2010-03-10) is a topic that generates constant discussions. It has been changed for the umpteenth time [about 10 years ago](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/revised-reprint-policy-2010-03-18), and it has been the subject of at least one [meeting](https://articles.starcitygames.com/premium/insider-trading-the-cost-of-cards-mr-bleiweiss-goes-to-washington-part-2-of-3/) with influential personalities after a lot of pressure from the community, but in recent months there have been new [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9 amp;v=d004BlPRVN4) and [proposals](https://articles.starcitygames.com/premium/why-its-time-to-remove-the-reserved-list-and-how-id-do-it/), all oriented towards radical change of the Reserved List or its abolition, in the general indifference of the WotC. In my opinion, some proposals made over the years have been pretty bad, but I appreciate the effort in discussing the Reserved List. For more information, see a summary of [how many times it has already been changed in the past](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Reserved_List) under pressure from the player community. What is currently lacking in the reserved list discussion is concrete coordination around this instance. After the Professor's video I thought it would be a good idea to start coordinating these scattered and messy opinions, in order to have an advocacy group based on a coherent, shared and influential project. Influential because, in addition to being influential personalities, everyone in the world of MTG has some sort of power: the single individual-player who can decide to buy or not (or complain, which is often the case), the content creator who can present an application to the general public, the judge and the pro player who can decide whether or not to participate in an event (in the past there are those who have decided not to participate in an event out of protest, at least among the pro players), and finally the great organizer (such as Starcitygames) who can implement influential choices in themselves. WotC employees themselves hold great power. I have two brief notes to make before continuing. * Stop saying that WotC does not want a growth of Vintage and Legacy because they do not gain anything. If WotC deemed it harmful to expand to these formats, they would not have insisted so much on promoting Commander, which uses both Legacy and Vintage cards. This has even been heralded as [the year of Commander](https://wpn.wizards.com/en/article/year-commander-starts-now), despite being a format full of Reserved List cards, it #8217;s not supported in any major DCI event (such as a GP, for example) and is a mostly for fun format. Expanding to niches can be extremely advantageous for a multinational, especially if they are niches with individuals who spend a lot: like, precisely, the players of the Eternal formats. * Stop saying that MTGO is the solution to the Reserved List. People need social interactions and it's nice to see a community grow and stabilize. MTGO offers you the convenience of playing from home, but does not allow you to have social interactions in person. In this period, we all know how much we miss the normality and closeness of other people. #  #10060; What we do NOT need: the abolition or modification of the Reserved List Although I am in favor of the abolition of the Reserved List, it would be impossible to create an advocacy group for such a radical change, which could even clash with an influential minority of individuals interested in keeping the promise represented by the reserved list. And precisely because it is a promise, its abolition would greatly damage the credibility of the WotC. Furthermore, my idea of  #8203; #8203;an advocacy group does NOT fight for the reintegration of foil loophole: it would be useless, risky for the price of the cards and would effectively invalidate the Reserved List. #  #10004; What we need: to insist on the flexibility of the concept of "spirit" around the Reserved List, while protecting the value of the reserved cards If the reserved list is  #8220;here to stay #8221;, the focus of the advocacy group is to re-discuss [the spirit of the reserved list](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/182971808703/could-rd-print-a-card-similar-to-one-on-the). In short, this [vague](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/2/e/2e5cd12a-2a07-44a8-8eac-de00d26fe9e3.jpg?1562800046) and [abstract](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/e/0e013033-3995-4ba8-b0c3-0614c79aaaab.jpg?1592517825) concept blocks the printing of cards similar to those of the Reserved List. In particular, it avoids the creation of cards that could provide valid alternatives to the more expensive ones that are currently used in competitive decks of various formats (mainly Vintage, Legacy and Commander). This is extremely frustrating for many players, it blocks the formation of new communities and prevents WotC from investing adequately in the market share of Eternal formats. In addition, it is especially very risky due to the continuous improvements of **counterfeit cards**. There are people who are constantly playing with counterfeit Reserved List cards, even in major tournaments like GPs, and I know many of you have heard or read various stories about it. Others are also unaware that they have counterfeit cards. Finally, I remind you that many shops still allow the use of proxies, which are often counterfeit cards: in my opinion, **this could already represent in itself a damage to the image of WotC**, also due to the struggle made in the past against counterfeiting. Returning to the concept of "spirit" of the RL, the point is that nothing stops WotC from printing dual lands that come in untapped if you haven't cast your Commander yet during the game, or that give flying to the \[\[Colossal Dreadmaw\]\] of your opponents. These are just a couple of silly examples. The concrete proposal is based on two apparently antithetical concepts, but in reality perfectly reconcilable and which indeed reinforce each other: 1. continue to protect the value of reserved cards over time as an investment and "luxury market"; 2. provide a cheaper but still competitive alternative to players, also regulated by a policy. # The Alternative List Below, a sketch for the idea. * Print cards that are alternatives to those of the Reserved List, with little influencing drawbacks, or with effects based on a particular concept of flavor and design, but still not very influential. Here is another example, deliberately ugly so as not to affect any future design work: a \[\[Plateau\]\] that enters tapped in multiplayer. In 1 vs 1 matches it would be irrelevant. I'll call it an equally bad name: Rocky Plateau. * Write a policy for these cards. Let's call it, for now, "Alternative List policy", containing precisely the "alternative cards". It is based on two key points. The first one is really complex and concerns "insider" issues, so read carefully. # 1) Mutual exclusivity **Whenever an alternative card is printed, a deck cannot contain the corresponding reserved card**. For example: if I have a Rocky Plateau, I cannot have any Plateau copies in my deck. If I have a Plateau, I cannot have any copies of Rocky Plateau. This would also help to test this type of banning based on pairs of cards and not on a single card, which, if I'm not mistaken, is already used in other games. Why is there a need for mutual exclusivity? More competitive players would prefer to have a different copy of each card (for example, one in the Alternative List and one in the Reserved List), to cope with game situations involving cards such as \[\[Predict\]\] and \[\[Surgical Extraction\]\] . This may also affect cards such as \[\[Phyrexian Revoker\]\] (in the case of nonland alternative cards with activated abilities) and \[\[Meddling Mage\]\] (in the case of nonland alternative cards). Also, in Commander, players would prefer to have both. There is another problem, however, which must be solved at the level of rules and which adds a level of complexity to the factor of mutual exclusivity: the ***meta-value of the card name***. This concept, already used in the [Godzilla cards](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/collecting-ikoria-2020-04-02), is complementary and internal to the mutual exclusivity and links even more reserved cards to alternative cards. Let's take a practical example: if I name \[\[Helm of Obedience\]\] with \[\[Cabal Therapy\]\], but my opponent has the alternative card, it will still have to be discarded. The same is true with different effects, such as those of Meddling Mage or Phyrexian Revoker. Obviously, the "alternative Helm of Obedience" will have a slightly different effect, and it cannot be replaced. For example, the alternative Helm of Obedience says "target player" instead of "target opponent", so, in this case, someone could redirect the effect of the card to you via \[\[Reroute\]\]. It is a very rare disadvantage that would justify the lower price of the alternative card, but it could also offer other interesting interactions. The meta-value of the card name, therefore, is based on the name only, not on other game issues. We have seen it, albeit in a different way, with the Godzilla cards, so it could be applied, with the necessary changes, also in the alternative cards policy. Fortunately, there are very few cards in the Reserved List strong enough to be played and to need these precautions regarding alternative cards, and moreover this rule can be remembered by adopting an aesthetic solution similar to Godzilla cards, with a reminder text box at the bottom to paper (perhaps aesthetically similar to what we see in the Mutate mechanic), and more. In short, there are solutions, they have already adopted similar ones in the past and could work in this new perspective. So why maintain mutual exclusivity if the name of the alternative card is considered the same as that of the reserved card? Mutual exclusivity, in my opinion, should however be maintained, both to avoid confusing the players with too many "slightly" different cards in the same deck, and to avoid taking advantage of certain game situations that include strange interactions between the reserved cards, the alternative cards and other cards. Slightly different texts can influence big game choices, including sideboarding ones. Mutual exclusivity and meta-value of the card name, therefore, are complementary precautionary measures. Mutual exclusivity creates a clear distinction between "mass market" and "luxury market", giving added value to the collection of a card in the Reserved List: providing an alternative would also help to protect more easily the cards in Reserved List from the wear and tear they suffer during the game, or from the risk of losing them or having them stolen, since the "alternative card" can be used. Also, for those who still want to play them, using the card in the Reserved List would be a new way to pimp a deck, which already happens when playing an Alpha Basic Land or a Guru Land. **It has already been widely discussed how the cards reprinted many times have retained their value, despite not even being part of the Reserved List or not used in any sanctioned format, like Old School**, so I don't think this would affect Revised duals, which instead would increase price over time, reinforcing their symbolic value of "exclusive cards", precisely because they will never be reprinted and it will have become impractical to falsify them to play. # 2) Protection of collector value and the luxury market In addition to market protection based on mutual exclusivity, **all the cards in the Alternative List cannot be printed foil, with the old frame, in full art or with other alternative frames**. This choice will protect the value of the cards in the Reserved List even better. Also, they will never be printed in Standard. Finally, it would be worth considering the possibility of printing them only in some languages, or even printing them exclusively in white border, but these are delicate and more extreme choices. The Alternative List is a complementary policy to the Reserved List: many people are still convinced that, in the future, the Reserved List will be abolished, for various reasons. The Alternative List does not modify the Reserved List, but strengthens it, increasing the credibility of a promise that has already been modified many times in the past, while allowing valid and competitive alternatives to be made accessible for playing Eternal formats. This could strengthen the luxury market: if I want to pimp my Legacy deck, I will not be able to buy a foil "alternative card #8221;, because it does not exist, so I have to take the corresponding reserved card. This would also help protect the value of Revised duals: now they are the "least expensive" option to have a dual, but with this policy they would become the first step in pimping a deck. Obviously, the market could be destabilized at first, but in the long run, the luxury market based on these cards would strengthen, while fighting counterfeit cards. Following a line based on prudence, WotC could do a cycle of Legendary Dual Lands with an irrelevant or almost irrelevant drawback in Legacy, evaluate their audience acceptance, and then print another cycle with another design, evaluating any future developments for cards like a Mox Diamond which can only add three colors, and so on. The options are many, as are the possibilities that WotC has to make money on such a choice. Even MaRo made a [hint about it](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/155088955703/a-lot-of-people-are-talking-about-this-after-the) on BlogAtog. However, I do not recommend the legendary duals, because they would damage the concept of mutual exclusivity of the Alternative List, which serves precisely to protect the value of the cards in the Reserved List, both for simple collection and for pimp reasons. How can we get what we need by looking at what has already worked in the past In the past, the voice of the communities has allowed some important changes in the game. Gavin Verhey, now a WotC employee, created the [Overextened](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/reconstructed/magic-and-me-2015-06-02), which was later welcomed by WotC and modified into the format we all know today: Modern. Without such an initiative led by a former pro player, probably none of you today could have played Modern, and even Piooner (also based on the popular "no rotation" concept, just like Legacy, Vintage and Commander). Another example comes from the popularity of Pauper, also fueled by influential people, such as the Professor. Finally, remember that the Commander, an extremely popular format, was born from the community and is regulated by it. There are also numerous examples that could be given of how, following complaints, the WotC corrected the course on some unpopular policies. You have already seen them in these months, so I will avoid focusing too much on them. But here, if many people have bothered the concept of [ #8220;this product is not for you #8221;](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2019/11/this-product-isnt-for-you/) with the Double Masters VIP Packs, then they should also organize themselves about changing the concept of  #8220;this format is not for you #8221;. The issues related to this situation could accumulate unexpectedly, so you cannot continue to leave these formats to speculation based on the Reserved List, which WotC does not want to influence for reasons it cannot declare, and which **leaves many communities of players in frustration or risk of counterfeiting cards**, which are now very common in Commander too. All this does not result in a good image for the company, if we refer to this specific context. Returning to the virtuous examples of the past, it is important to have influential people and communities that implement effective and lasting communication around this issue. # Influential people In the era of communication, without influential people, you can't go anywhere. For this reason, this post is an appeal to anyone who wants to coordinate for concrete action, taking advantage of the power that everyone holds. **Remember that this is only a starting point, because this is an imperfect and improvable proposal**. This can become a project based on common perspectives, and anyone interested will have to do their part, even if this may mean, only in extreme cases, taking a protest attitude towards the WotC. I'm not talking about protest against MaRo and other employees: they have already fought a lot to change the Reserved List and we should stop being rude to them on this subject. Below, here's how it could be managed in the perspective of an advocacy group composed of different communities. * **Content creators**: organize more content to discuss on the Reserved List. No more arguing using strictly personal opinions on impossible perspectives. "The Reserved List is a Lie" is more of a vain hope than a concrete argument, although I'm sorry to say this, and is based on the belief of many that the Reserved List has an expiration date. As much as I hope it is, the Reserved List does not seem to have an end yet in the near future. For this reason, we should rather insist, for all interested content creators, on a COMMON, SHARED and PLAUSIBLE perspective, starting from a proposal like mine (the Alternative List), which in fact does not contemplate any modification of the Reserved List, but a new approach to card design and accessibility. Therefore, I would like this proposal of mine to be discussed more extensively through videos and articles. * **Judges and pro players**: both could equally put pressure on this speech as they are also very influential members, simply by writing articles and making videos. If a protest is needed due to poor WotC response, they can arrange to refuse to attend important events. [This has happened in the past for other issues](https://www.google.com/search?q=gerr+thompson+refuses+to+play amp;oq=gerr+thompson+refuses+to+play amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4580j0j9 amp;sourceid=chrome amp;ie=UTF-8). * **Big organizers and big sellers**: Starcitygames and Channel Fireball, for example, have a great opportunity in this regard. Due to the economic crisis of Covid and the [continuing dwindling of players at some events](https://i.imgur.com/mww6Onc.png), they could use this opportunity to revive the gaming economy. Many people want to play Legacy, Vintage and Commander with strong and competitive cards, and my proposal linked to the Alternative List would allow them to do so, both at the level of sales and at the level of events. In the event of silence or negative response from WotC, they may decide to refuse to organize events (very risky choice) or to allow the use of reserved list card proxies at their Commander, Legacy and Vintage events (which, I repeat, many already do). However, great understanding and collaboration are needed on a common line. * **WotC employees**: you are part of the company, I believe you have a form of power to re-propose a corporate discussion on the subject after 10 years. * **Players**: Your feedback is important, but there are issues that you can't resolve with simple complaints. We need a new website or space on an already popular site, such as the Commander's website, to address the issue. I need people to write mails in various languages  #8203; #8203;about this particular proposal for the categories of people and stakeholders previously outlined in this thread. I expect to be contacted by volunteers for this project. # Conclusions It took me days to write this proposal and I am not a native speaker of English, so sorry if anything might be unclear. For Italians, I have the text saved in our language, if you are interested. Now there is a real need for a response from the various communities. You can comment or contact me to better organize the matter. I would like to share this post with some influential people, but you have to too. In this way we will have a support for a precise design able to encourage this change. "I've talked about this before but it's an important enough point to make again. The reserve list (the list that tells us what cards we can never reprint, for those who don't know) was created long ago by people who no longer work at Wizards. It was done to help ease concerns of our player base at the time. The majority of current R amp;D feels that the reprint list isn't fulfilling the function it was created for (and at times seems to actually counteract it), but, and this is the important sticking point, we've learned through market research that the majority of our audience feels it's important for Wizards of the Coast, as a company, to keep its word. So we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. We want to do what is best for the game and our players and we want to keep the confidence of our consumers. If anyone has a solution to this Gordian knot, please let me know." \- [Mark Rosewater, 2009](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/tweet-talk-2009-06-05). I think that now, more than 11 years later, there is an alternative to consider. I believe that the Old School format, the interest in pimp and collecting are important points to consider in order to understand how this proposal can be absolutely valid. Discuss again the Reserved List (even with another meeting) can't be embarrassing if compared to Double Master flawed VIP packages, Jumpstart mass misprints and other bad choices WotC has made during the last years. From the perspective of a lot of players and sellers, this could be an opportunity to gain more confidence in the market, to invest more in the game and to please an extremely large number of people for the difficult years ahead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a 26 year old boy and I look much younger than my other peers. I would like to start using eye makeup, to get an emo effect, someone recommended me a kajal. The problem is that I suffer from chronic allergic conjunctivitis, which occasionally comes back to me and causes me some minor discomfort, so I can't put on too much makeup close to the eyeball. I don't want too flashy makeup, but something that suits me. I decided not to put photos of myself because I believe that everyone can have different opinions on what could be better for me, but [this](https://www.facebook.com/JohnnieGuilbert/photos/a.2604750029753064/2830048083889923) is the result I would like to achieve. I saw this guy's tutorial, but the video is no longer available now. He put the makeup around the eye and then blended it with his finger. It seems quite suitable for me as a method, because it is not very "invasive". Are there products for difficult customers like me? I preferably look for organic products from environmentally friendly companies and I give priority to the best quality products. Price is not a problem, and I already know that a quality product that lasts a long time without drooling and that is hypoallergenic can cost a lot more than other brands. If blending with your finger might be insufficient, I also look for recommendations for a suitable brush.</TEXT>

They complain while still buying from them, playing MTGA and spending money on MTGO. [Gillette has lost a lot of customers for much less](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0). Please MTG players, stop being the k-pop fangirl that waits for a new product. Stop buying sealed product, stop playing from official clients, stop playing the most supported formats. I've understand that years ago and I regret almost nothing (I love Limited, but I prefer to not open packs if a company is so ridicoulous). Togheter, we have a great form of power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I understand, it's possible to see other Secret Lairs with mechanically unique cards and non-canon references or characters, at least in the near future. Those cards can be later reprinted with a more MtG-related art and name in other products, like Mystery Booster. Would you like if some of the future Secret Lairs will try to push the Reserved List "spirit"? It happened recently with cards like \[\[Deep-Forest Hermit\]\]. Also, the game seems changing enough to allow this. [Here](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/155088955703/a-lot-of-people-are-talking-about-this-after-the) you can find a BlogAtog post about the future of Legendary Dual Lands, even if making a Legendary Dual may be against the Reserved List, because it's simply a supertype addition, so they must also add some rules text that are non-relevant in formats like Legacy. However, the Legendary Dual Lands are only an example between the various possibilities, including non-Legendary Duals or other Reserved List cards. I know that a lot of us want the Reserved List abolished, but a company like Hasbro will prefer to proceed with caution about this particular re-discussion of the policy approach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every format they touch ends in a mess, but it would be a great idea if they find a way to learn from previous mistaked and also reprint Reserved List cards, making them ugly and less collectible (for example, only with the new frame, never in foil, never with alternative frames and only with the white border). As long as Hasbro has WotC or this game doesn't goes in a profound crisis, I doubt that a Reserved List reprint will happen. So, stop buying sealed products, stop playing the more competitive formats, stop playing on official clients, and support future initiatives against the Reserved List.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cockatrice/comments/ivc9fn/rooster\_ranges\_oktoberfest\_2020\_tournaments/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cockatrice/comments/ivc9fn/rooster_ranges_oktoberfest_2020_tournaments/) On Saturday afternoon there will be a Legacy tournament on Cockatrice, FREE and with MONEY prizes. It was originally placed yesterday, but I managed to get it moved to the 24th cause of the Eternal Weekend. **You have to register the previous days**. I recommend that you look at the links at the top of the post regarding tournament management, judge calls and more.  #8203; The prizes are: 1st: $ 100 2nd: $ 50 3rd-4th: $ 25 5th-8th: $ 20  #8203; I hope this tournament circuit becomes something more stable over time, as an alternative for all those who, like me, would like to play on MTGO, but have no desire to spend money on it just to finance Hasbro's desire to move Legacy and Vintage into the online dimension, rather than finding a solution to the stupid Reserved List policy. End of controversy, see you on Saturday.</TEXT>
