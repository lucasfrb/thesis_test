    <TEXT>Hi Portable Gamers! This subreddit is dedicated to Games you can copy onto a USB and play without installation. Sometimes you feel the need to play games on a college, work or public computer, but you dont want to install anything or leave behind all the files and registry keys. (Also it can be disrespectful to those who have to use the computer after you.) The point of this subreddit is to share and discover those portable games. If you don't know what a portable game or 'app' is, It's defined as a program which has been specially created or modified to run without certain permission. ie; No admin rights, certain ports blocked, certain intrusive features blocked, etc. It can usually be downloaded remotely or put on a external media at home (Such as DVD, USB or other removable media) and then run without installing. You should also be able to copy the installation between computers. Portable apps are incredibly helpful; you can drop them onto a USB and take them with you on the go. There are more uses than gaming, however this subreddit focuses on only games with the intent of curing your boredom! If you're interested in extending in portable applications that are not gaming related check out http://portableapps.com/. Join the discussion on everything Portable games related, focusing on the heap of free games to which you can run off a flash drive. Enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking at confirmed 25% growth rate per day but thats based only on 5 day delayed test results coming back and a whole bunch of other factors - not enough test kits - only testing people who've come into contact with international people - not testing symptom-less people - not testing ( in most cases ) people WITH symptoms so the number is likely higher as not everyone can get tested Goverment is continuing sending kids to school because they are "not impacted" but they can have the virus without knowing and spread to their parents and anyone they interact with (same with young people in general) They're kicking the can down the road because closing schools would mean more of the workforce staying home (gotta keep dat economy going - people are expendable)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This would have a great benefit - and we know they've done this before. The problem is the act of getting more gifts. ignoring the glaringly obviousl fact that people shouldnt leave their house, they would need to make 4/5 gifts drop per spin for those who can hit stops. Gifts could also contain gifts. And limit to 30/50 gift drops per day (down from 200 or something) or just a limit of 10 gift sourced gifts</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We built a new network - but instead of telstra + optus owning most of the cables NBNCO owns it all now (They bought all the outdated cables and ran some new ones) NBNCO then charges all of the internet providers to use the network - they are offering free extra bandwidth. Bad providers usually try to buy as little internet as possible to make the most money. But now that everyones working from home - people are using the internet more. **TLDR**: Your internet provider is in charge of buying enough internet for your neighborhood (which sometimes they can be bad at) from NBNCO And NBNCO is now offering them a deal on Internet bandwidth for the next 3 months so the NBN does not fall apart (any further)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The landscape this virus is going to create is going to catch a lot of people off guard. I know heaps of people who are just going about life as per normal. And it's partly due to the government and businesses handling the situation (economy and profit over the learnings from other countries) Ultimately you cannot control other people, and preaching barely pursuades anyone. Just do your best to look after yourself (and anyone who will actually listen) because if your young, not much is going to happen to you Except in a couple of weeks hospitals are going to be overwhelmed with older patients who can't handle the virus - make sure you don't need a hospital is my only advice Anyone who sounds alarmist / overly cautions is doing the right thing. Because in a best case scenario they will be wrong. Edit: but yes there is no need to hoarde anything, shops will remain open, just stop going near people ...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Economy can take a backseat. Keeping people alive is the #1 priority. Having a healthy, living workforce will mean we can pick our economy back up later, and quicker. Having things open longer will have a worse long term impact on the economy if the virus can spread faster. Note picking up our economy is going to be rough our current government has been miss-managing the economy for a number of years: - huge household debt - terrible NBN cost cuts [which cost more in the long run] - funding cuts to essential services like fire brigades and back burning (ala earlier this year, the 4th largest bushfires we've ever seen) - terrible infrastructure projects (Sydney light rail)</TEXT>

But MUTING is very useful in modern games thesedays, because even fun games can be ruined by just one individual. cut these people off early (in game mute) and you can often resume having fun!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Telstra wholesale is worse because it is designed to only match the competition (Optus / Vodaphone) - From memory it's used by Aldi mobile, Woolworths and belong Telstra retail network is telstras competitive offering which is usually well above the rest and built / reserved for themselvs Boost is owned / managed by Tesltra, but works on a prepaid model. Customer support is US based and pretty good. And live chat is also great (Not sure if COVID will impact this) Belong (also owned by Telstra) didn't secure the good retail network because of some conflict of interest / regulation. If you're thinking of swapping to Boost, but you're already on Tesltra, you cannot buy a simcard from your supermarket, they have to mail you a SIM card due to Telstra / Boost using the same network. (Ring their sales team instead) Otherwise if you're with any other network just buy a SIM at the shops. (And ring up support / or use live chat to port your number) Just make sure you arnt currently paying out any contract with your current service provider (wait until you're out of contract) I watched my partner trial Boost for a year to see if it worked before giving up my Tesltra plan. $30 for 20GB that rolls over each month if unused (I'm not a large data user)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its normal for decaying exponential growth to look like its exploding Our curve isnt terrible - and remember it takes at least 8 - gt; 20 days before isolation actually is reflected in the curve. because people today are already infected, they will eventually add to the curve. Here is another good video where someone has explained how to understand exponential growth - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc The **problem here** is that each curve is ONLY drawn from confirmed cases and in Australia there are strict rules around who CAN be tested. we are going to run out of people who have "interacted with someone overseas" so testing will just STOP, and so will "confirmed cases" meanwhile cases are increasing. In reality, the curve will never accurately reflect our current stance because you cant realistically test everyone. but when no-one gets tested, is the government just going to say "we're fixed!" - thats some china level stuff right there. and we have growth we cant actually see because its incorrectly recorded.

    <TEXT>From the page: - You have returned from overseas in the past 14 days and you develop respiratory illness with or without fever - You have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days and you develop respiratory illness with or without fever - You have severe community-acquired pneumonia and there is no clear cause - You are a healthcare worker who works directly with patients and you have a respiratory illness and a fever How are you supposed to get tested if you come into contact with someone with community spread? the largest spread vector. All of the respiratory based issues are fair, but we know the majority of people have mild cases - and will go untested / unrecorded because they dont fall in these buckets. Someone linked another article saying that doctors have been advised to test every 5th person, which is great news!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days" Most of our baseline "infected" were only acknowledged if they were from overseas. meaning if you are part of un-tested community spread (the person who gave it to you wasnt tested) you also cannot get tested. As soon as we get rid of rule #2 the better. These rules are literally written assuming that only international people can spread the virus - which is obviously highly flawed.</TEXT>

Heat has a significant impact on disabling the virus living outside the body (which is circumstantial at best when translating to how it infects inside the body) but if it lives shorter lifespans on surfaces in hotter weather - then you can expect winter to be pretty rough for us Also note that weaker immune systems has no impact on not getting infected with COVID-19 because we have no immunity to this foreign virus. its only going impact if you have an increased chance of death (however pre-existing health conditions - high blood pressure, asthma, obesity etc) will play more of a factor sources for heat : https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051524v1</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A very high level overview of bank accounts / investment strategies are: Transaction / everyday accounts - basically no interest, but you can move money anywhere you like Savings accounts - Higher interest than everyday, but you have to add X amount per month, or make X transactions per month (or both). Long term deposit account - Deposit X amount of money for X number of months and no longer have access to it, supposedly higher but locked in interest rate. Higher Risk Investments - shares, stocks, ETF that appreciate (hopefully) over the very long term Due to the current economic landscape the original person you replied to is suggesting keep your money at the savings account level. there is increased uncertainty that could result in you not having access to your money at those higher tier investment options. Keep up the good work, there isnt any magic way to duplicate your money without risk, and depending on your risk tollerance - its probably not the time to do so now.

All these studies around "how long does corona last" don't really give a good answer on "how long does activated corona last" because to test that you have to take those detected virus particles and try to infect someone with them - which is not only questionable but also really hard to determine they didn't catch it somewhere else.

    <TEXT>Having no Football (soccer knowledge) im going to try explain it without that context This particular tornament - a "Win" was re-classified as winning the game by 2 goals In this particular elimination bracket, it was about to end with one team leading by 1 goal This 1 goal does not classify a win under the new 2 goal rules - and they were going to be eliminated They decided to score an own goal - which made the 2 teams scores equal. This triggers overtime where the rules are "next goal wins" from what I can tell therefore any goal scored on overtime is instantly worth a win (or 2 goals) From the context I gathered, the game never made it to overtime because the upper-bracket team caught on and scored their own own-goal to ensure the lower brackets teams "win" was only by 1 point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>support is a 3rd world call center detatched from Niantic. They only respond to known issues with the game they can help with. Its highly likely that you'll get a cookie cutter response and your feedback thrown in the bin. The only thing Niantic will listen to is collectively as a country we go on a strike and not spend money - something thats not going to happen unfortunately. This change has to be identified by even the most dedicated whale as a bad change for this to impact Niantics decision.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know there are different types / releases and frameworks of cloud platforms, especially that have come out in the last 3 years right? They could be changing cloud stacks to the latest version While in theory it could be done without maintenance, it might be a big enough jump they need to take the game down. Niantic may have not kept up to date with the upgrade path, that's sounds exactly like what they would do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless Niantic is explicitly coming out saying its a new feature. Always expect nothing is happening. - there are basically no rumours / hidden new features in PokemonGo. - they already make billions on this game by doing nothing The only hidden agendas Niantic has are to ways to make more money. Even if they announce a new feature - why get excited? its likely riddled with bugs on launch anyway? You cant get mad that they are doing some inconsequential changes to try improve the game - even if it does have a 50/50 chance of making the game LESS stable ----- My initial point is that ""fully managed, scalable, relational database service" usually means you can do upgrades seamlessly as you can swap out your tech stack with no impact to users. thats one of the benefits of cloud computing - 100% uptime. however my counter point was - thats assuming that Niantic has maintained their platform correctly over the years, which may not be the case OR they could find themselves in a rare edge case where they need to make a big tech jump to the next platform that will require a full outage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you say "basemap update" do you mean visual map update for the game? They dont need this change to do that - because they've updated the map in the past. They likely arnt doing this - because last time there were so many greifed map elements they included (like cities covered in water) that it was not worth the payoff for them to update the map. If you're interested - this might give you some insight on how they feel (even though its a april fools day post) https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2018/04/01/niantic-openstreetmap-collaboration/</TEXT>

The press conferences Dan was putting out = were Day compared to Night, aka the ones Scomo did that were incomprehensible... It put me at ease knowing "most" of the acceptable behaviors I could undertake obviously some teething issues came out (L Platers / renters lock) but they are a small price to pay for clear, concise messaging, and unfortunate side effects of fast action. You cant really measure the benefits because the alternatives are on a different timeline. but I see very little was actually lost during the time of "dRaCoNiAn LoCkDoWns" - obviously mindful of lost jobs here, but that is happening worldwide and also a complex issue. amongst those who have unfortuantely lost things between COVID19, you also get unknown victories from people who wernt impacted, or benefited from quick action.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The other person has some great points. However as a support, if you stay in lane with your carry then you're halfing the amont of XP your leaning partner is getting out of the lane. If you can let them safely farm on their own, you can stack the camp. In cases where you couldn't farm the stack yourself, you've doubled the XP for your carry who can rotate and clear that stack later. Also on older maps, you could pull your creeps into the stacked camp (not sure if this is still in game) denying the XP to the other team, and then the lane equalibrium (where the creeps meet) would fall back below your tower where your carry would be safer under tower</TEXT>

Customer support is US based and pretty good. And live chat is also great (Not sure if COVID will impact this)  gt; Belong (also owned by Telstra) didn't secure the good retail network because of some conflict of interest / regulation.  gt; If you're thinking of swapping to Boost, but you're already on Tesltra, you cannot buy a simcard from your supermarket, they have to mail you a SIM card due to Telstra / Boost using the same network. (Ring their sales team instead)  gt; Otherwise if you're with any other network just buy a SIM at the shops. (And ring up support / or use live chat to port your number)  gt; Just make sure you arnt currently paying out any contract with your current service provider (wait until you're out of contract)  gt; I watched my partner trial Boost for a year to see if it worked in a blackspot area before giving up my Tesltra plan.  gt; My current plan is $30 for 20GB that rolls over each month if unused (I'm not a large data user, currently rolling over to 40GB every month) I am a IT consultant with no affiliations with any telecommunications provider, and hate Telstra with a passion, however I will always highly research  amp; buy the best product for me I feel like blackspots are most likely when you will need a phone the most - but its nice to go to the beach and always have reception</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think at this stage of the game - XP is irrelavent even if more levels are added. There is no doubt that another game element will be tied to new levels, where the extra steps / requirements (in addition to XP) will be the limiting factor to leveling up - like the way ingress works. Heaps of people have been level 40 for 1-2 years, and adding more levels and having them retroactively just get added to peoples accounts is not going to cut it IMO **TLDR:** Niantic will augment the in-game progression system with additional requirements, and the XP component will be irrelevant if they ever add additional levels over 40.</TEXT>

In regards to ISPs - I won't reccomend anyone other than Aussie Broadband. Australian owned, they always buy enough CVC (won't slow down in peak times) great service and are doing great things for the ISP competitiveness. They arnt the cheapest, but you're paying to know your internet isn't ever going to be slow. NBN has it's limitations, but Aussie Broadband have an amazing web portal, and you can instantly schedule in a plan change that comes into effect for the following month if you want to change your data cap, or speed - without having to talk to anyone. Their main call center is in gipsland and everyone I've spoken to on the phone was knowledgeable , and could properly communicate what was going on - but I already have a good understanding of NBN technologies due to my line of work</TEXT>

There was genuine interest in mapping, cateloging and building community sites with the data Niantic was providing. This was not harnessed, and immediately shut down as "missuse" however Ingress has this already (and while it has been missused) PokemonGo could have a community friendly version of this API's in scales 10 times larger than PokemonGo exist - but Niantic refuse to aknolege this as something people were interested in</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of parts of this game have animations / extra detail just for the sake of having it. wish there was a way to turn off all the animations and high textures ESPECIALLY to save battery life. There should be more emphasis on actual gameplay - thats the thing most people should care about. Maybe there is a high correlation between "This game looks amazing" and "im going to spend money on this amazing looking graphical game" because this problem runs systematic through modern games, where gameplay suffers over "wow this looks amazing" in so many modern games/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know online games have been slowly taking over the last decade or so. Especially due to isolation, there were some LAN games that were playable even if everyone was in their own homes. Did anyone else attempt to set up their own games during isolation? Below are the games I found success with hosting from home (Install Server | Port Forward | Tell friends my IP) **Minecraft** Minecraft server code is easy to download, install and find custom maps for. it meant I didnt have to buy a server - I could just host one temporarily on my server PC - and everyone could join. **Teeworlds** A free game on steam, 2D platformer, again the server code is easy to find, download and deploy, was fun for a good 30-60 minutes - so shorter timeframe, but still fun. **CSGO** Download the server tools from SteamCMD, annoyingly the server is like 25GB, BUT a pro tip if you're going to do this - the valve wiki has a cool community tool that will automatte all the scripting and instalation. (csgosl) Anyone else play any LAN games hosted at home over the internet? or just online only games?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This likely stems from a number of poor design solutions that have compounded over time. rather than "technology keeps moving" Many games can be optimised to run properly on 32bit devices. Whats more likely is that the compounding issues of Niantic head office - Developers only allowed to work on new features - Developers not given enough time to create good working features - Poor / inadequate testing (or none at all) - Good developers leave due to the poor decision making / work culture - tech debt grows until they have such a poorly maintained codebase they are literally dropping support for older devices. I dont know about you, but If I had a multi-billion dollar free to play game (which funds itself on the sheer number of people who enjoy playing the game) founded on the basis of community getting together and interacting.

    <TEXT>Having watched a lot of both SalC1 usually dosnt pad out his content like FitMC does - FitMC has a greatly different content style. In saying that - SalC1 has my favorite flavour of videos - duplicating items on pay-to-win mine-craft servers that break the ToS. a genre I didnt even know I wanted (but not really mealtime appropriate) FitMC is probably better for non-minecraft players, as SalC1 will talk about pretty indepth topics, while FitMC used to be a teacher, and applies that delivery style to his videos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Minecraft rejuvinated the sandbox genre back in 2009. You are essentially thrown into a randomly generated world of Dirt, Trees, water, caves etc. You have to fend for yourself, and mine resources using your hands (punch trees) or tools You can then craft the resources you gain from the land into items, tools, or cosmetic blocks On release you had to play in conjunction with the dedicated wiki sites, but now there is a book that tells you what you can craft with your available resources. Let me know if you want any additional resources, but Minecraft is basically virual lego, where you can choose to do a seemingly infinite number of tasks from - Mining - Building / Decorating - Automating And this is just vanilla Minecraft - because the game is coded in Java thousands of mod developers have contributed to an almost infinite number of possibilities if you're willing to get technical. Pokemon recreated in minecraft, Dragons added to Minecraft - almost anything mod developers have customised. Multiplayer servers are also an option - with the java version allowing anyone to join your server via LAN if they're on the same network.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tf2s success hinged on the fact that it was valves testing ground. The Free to play model was basically born here. And in it's Hayday, valve was testing new features like cosmetics, new weapons and other community engagement experiments. It was only once CSGO and DOTA took off, and they didn't need TF2 as a testing ground anymore that they moved on. My main point being that TF2 is bloated because that was its purpose, new iterations were added because it was designed to be constantly kept fresh with new trial content. But valve perfected their model, and moved on developing other things, and TF2 was frozen as it is today</TEXT>

Other people (outside of this forum) arnt going to understand this mindset - some might, but not all your friends will. It's completely up to you, but if you're already saving your target rate, you should also prioritise your friends as well. You could offset this by hosting cheaper events, or attending ones that you think are good value for money. But after a certain point you might find that friends stop inviting you to anything that costs money because they instantly assume you won't go.

Enabling steam mobile authenticator will trigger a **15 day trade and market hold** (this is you) But swapping an already established authentication to a new mobile device using text message verification (NOT removing and re-adding) will only incur a **7 day trade and market hold** restriction This is because steam wants to give people 15 days to realise if someone is trying to hijack their account by adding a malicious mobile authenticator. But they only give you 7 days if you're just swapping devices because you've already done the initial setup and maintained security levels - it's less likely someone other than yourself is doing it</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;so I just disable Wi-Fi and mobile data before launching the app You need internet to log into the steam mobile authentication app. If by "app" they actually meant the steam desktop program, thats still overkill you're correct that your phone will continue to generate time-sensitive authentication tokens - with or without internet. but you dont need to kill wifi permanently on your phone to achieve what OP is asking for. you can just log-out of the steam mobile app, and it obviously will not show you as online via mobile app. you can still generate login tokens while not being logged into the mobile app. A few loopholes here though. - To trade on steam, you need to accept trade confirmations, which need internet and being logged into the mobile app. - To sell on the market, you need to accept market verifications, which need internet and being logged into the mobile app. - If you're not on a desktop, you might like viewing profile data on your mobile app. All of these reasons might make your solution invalid. I've found that the setting inside the mobile app "Settings  gt; Go Offline" usually respect my offline preference for the duration of the session. Note you can also make an andoid homescreen widgit that shows you your mobile autnenticator code regardless if you're Logged In, Offline internet etc. (but not trade / market confirms)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no way to do it. The only way is to go back in time and have set up the authenticator 15 days ago. These holds are in place to ensure people have ample warning if someone hijacks their account. by adding a mobile authentication you're much safer overall, but steam have decided that the process of getting there needs a cooldown. **risky alternative - not recommended** You have one potential avenue you could explore - but its highly risky and only reccomended to be done with a close friend. Im not sure if this will work - because you're in a 15 day hold period. but when you dont have mobile authenticator - people you've been friends with (like 90+ days) only have a 1 day trade hold. you could see if trading the knife to a VERY CLOSE FRIEND (who has mobile authentication set up) might buy games for you after selling the knife. **Important** your friend would have to have: - good standing mobile authentication (for 15 days) - THE SAME STORE CURRENCY as you. - be VERY trustworthy. you can check immediately with a different item - just initiate (but not send) a trade offer request to your friend. there will be a yellow popup banner that says "this trade will be held for X days" if it says "1 day" you're sweet **WARNING** - I think you will actually reset your 15 day ban if you pull the knife off the market (assuming the knife is currently on a market hold) and I dont know if that will incur a trade ban... so this solution is only if you've run out of options - and 100% want to try getting these funds within the current steam sale. because it could extend your ban / hold time a little longer if things dont work as I am expecting them to.</TEXT>

It's a systematic issue from the top, where developers are told to prioritise speed and new features over doing things right.

If you search a topic and only 1 thread with two comments shows up - you bet their bottom dollar they're going to ask again. sure - theres a majority of players who are going to post repetitive questions regardless. but why punish those willing to do some actual research on a topic in older threads?? deleting posts achieves nothing other than frustrating people, unless you're trying to scrub the subreddit clean with your own narrative</TEXT>

They make mistake upon mistake, and seem to purely focus mostly on advancing AR tech and Their Point of Interest (POI) database - TBH they cant even do that correctly All this miss-directed focus comes at the detriment of their playerbases / games. That being said, millions of people still play the crap out of their games for some reason been playing since launch and seen so many issues with PokemonGo that range from basic fundamental programming issues, to pure untested design errors - all presumably a resultant from their terrible upper management structure which is laregly not visible from anyone on the outside. - this also includes offering the least amount possible of offshore in-game support branded to look as if its their own company. most of my top rated comments are from pointing out issues with the game - in a subreddit that basically removes any non-constructive threads  amp; comments</TEXT>

Testing adequately is how you identify, track, trace and manage the outbreak - the numbers we are getting lately are un-manageable for the tracing team to get on top of, and have the large potential to grow exponentially if we can't understand the numbers. You have to remember that the next 8 days of case are already locked in - as it takes 8 days to gestate, and we haven't done any preventative measures yet. Again, the numbers have the potential to snowball from here, and not only the economy will be impacted, but all the elderly, sick, immunocompromised and other vulnerable people (avoidable deaths) will be impacted ALONGSIDE the economy.

    <TEXT>I think you're wrong, but not for the conventional reasons here. Revisiting old projects by valve employees is not really something that is done unless significant innovations can be made. Consoles arnt something that valve have a lot of control over, or interest in.

I don't know much the console developer process has changed, but 10 years ago valve was burnt by Sony / Xbox charging developers obscene amounts to release updates. Valve are keen to make games for all gamers, but they have a bias towards their own platform , making new innovative games over remakes of old one, and on a platform that won't be backwards compatible in 10 years time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heres my rough notes: All numbers presumably since midnight Wednesday **Border checks for cars** - 85k Cars checked on borderlines of lockdown zone - 151 fines; most common reason visiting friends, family, overnight stays **Other fines / building checks** Latrobe street premises 10 party-goers fined, then later in the night, another 24 fined after additional callout Landlord was also issues a fine under the pretence on presumably how the premises was leased. "KFC is popular" one person was fined after insisting to dine in, and authorities were called. 10 People having a pissup on the street A carload of PokemonGo players were fined, as it does not adhere to the 4 reasons to leave your house Massage parlours / sex working is not permitted and ~40 fines have been issues to attendees  amp; $10,000 fines for the businesses Callouts are resulting in people hiding in cupboards and garages, which is not appropriate, and a signal of people being found regardless of where they try to hide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're asking seriously, Dota2 is a MOBA (Multi online battle arena) If that dosnt make sense, and you've never heard of Leauge of Legends or smaller MOBAS like Heros of the Storm. Then basically, 5 players are versed against another 5 players. there are usually 100+ different charachters with different spells (stun a player, heal players, increase attack damage / attack speed / extend someones respawn time) Your teams goal is to destroy one building burried in the other teams base, your team will have to spread out across the map collecting experience from the "creeps" that act accordingly around the map, as your charachter levels up, you get stronger / more abilities. and the game transitions into killing the other team, and detroying their stronger buildings - progressing towards their base to eventually win. The other team is also attempting to do this - and whichever "Ancient" building dies signifies the losing team. The sheer number of Heros and items available means there is almost infinite combinations of battle possibilities, like chess on steroids. Other details: - Players can be a pretty toxic at times if you mess up - The skill floor (how long it takes to learn the basics) is usually around 100 hours - as a result game-play can be rewarding - usual games take between 30-60 mins - balance patches that change hero skills + values usually make gameplay "fresh" let me know if I made sense or any questions</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's disappointing to read all of the bad takes from people in this thread How do people think fully reopening economy is more valuable than thousands of people's lives? Everyone using the pandemic as a scapegoat to somehow 100% reopen the economy must either be a corporate shill, overwhelmingly ignorant or a narcissist. Hospitals arnt overwhelmed because of our previous efforts... Edit: I understand the economy is an important keystone to human life sustinance and agree with you, but it needs balancing just like COVID does. its not a matter of ignore COVID and the Economy comes back on. All of these armchair pandemic response experts coming here and criticizing our government, specifically holding Dan Andrews 100% responsible. Dan's not perfect and has learnt a great deal from some of the mistakes made in this pandemic, but he didn't singlehandedly cause the entire thing. anyone shitting all over him appears to be just looking for an easy blame target for their frustrations filling their inflexible, selfish, ignorant brain. Haven't seen a single person offer logical alternatives to Dan's management stratergies. We live in a world where you can go and get the answer to something within 30 seconds, and I guess people can't comprehend a complex situation anymore, this thing will likely drag on for 4-5 years, these people are constantly going to struggle adjusting and realising this is the new way of life. My heart goes out to people who are doing it tough. As another comment has said - this is a biological disaster and there are huge barriers to how we usually solve humanitarian issues like this - coming together as a group - as helping those who are the most vunerable is something that could make a lot of people feel much better about this whole situation. But we can do one thing to help the vunerable - the best thing we can do for these vunerable people is listen to the health advice, limit your exposure to the outside world and stop making selfish decisions. Mental health is another factor we don't have many solutions in place for, and I'm not going to pretend I have any answers. Most of what I said here is going to fall on deaf ears, because I assume people will either agree with my comment already, or they specifically come here to spruke the points I touched on as a form or stress release. TLDR - Lots of people seem to embrace their own opinions that the economy is king (despite it not being able to handle this pandemic very well) and are wishing with every fiber of their being that things just magically return to normal. Anyone who's realised that this isn't really a possibility seem to think it's one single persons fault instead of using their intelligence to consider the complex nature of our state. Let's try excersizing some compassion, flexibility and not just blame a single person - this pandemic isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand there are risks to the economy receding, but the economy shouldn't drive us as a species, it's here to serve our needs. We've lived through a 30 year period of GDP growth, avoiding the GFC but with a reliance in areas such as Tourism, International Education, Leveraged housing prices, exploited mineral extraction. Some of those things are under strain now, and arnt returning anytime soon. What point is 30 years economic growth if 3-4 bad years undoes it all? The system is sounding a bit broken I'm not an ecconomist, but if the economy isn't able to adjust to a period of downturn, then that's going to have to be managed accordingly alongside the virus. It's not really a one-or-the-other scenario.</TEXT>

I am a naturally stoic person as my coping mechanism, but realistically: If you look at other successful countries, they have some restrictions lifted, and we can aim for this - but putting a timeframe on it is borderline impossible. It's going to be a constant balancing act, which I imagine people are going to get tired of - and that's going to have to be factored into the plan too.

    <TEXT>In Australia - Steam's refund policy goes against our consumer rights So FYI for Australians, Steam will still give you a refund even if you've breached your 2 hours, or its 2 weeks old - no questions asked provided the game is broken, or you cant play it for any reason. You cannot use the reason "game is now cheaper" because that is not a valid refund reason under Australian consumer law. (But steam will still allow this if you satisfy the 2 hours + 2 week rules) Australia has amazing consumer laws which protect its citizens against the sale of defective or broken products (including online goods) Big lawsuit won by ACCC couple of years ago - instead of updating the refund policy, they just dont question if you attempt to refund from Australia</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Limited account is just for new accounts that have just started on steam. Long standing accounts can actually fall out of "good standing" which is similar to limited accounts. To avoid this you need to make sure you need to purchase a game or product from the steam store (using any fund type; credit card or wallet) at least once every 365 days. If you don't buy at least one item each year valve considers your account "not in good standing" and you'll be unable to trade or use the steam marketplace To restore your normal features you'll need to buy something AND wait 30 days before your account will be lifted back to "good standing" (Don't know if microtrasactions from games work, eg CSGO keys) Prevents scammers hijacking abandoned accounts for their rare items, and slows down any successful attempts at doing this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just an FYI OP. Once you've purchased something from the steam store (a game or DLC) it will take a further 30 days (apparently only 7 now!) before you can use the market or trade items. This is a measure to protect accounts that steam considers "abandoned" because they consider it unusual to not buy anything once a year. For my alt accounts I set reminders every summer and winter sale to buy a 70c game to avoid this exact issue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tail grab latency is a systematic issue of multiplayer online gaming. While its annoying, the reality is that in a 30+ player environment like this - the only other alternative is players lagging around the map constantly re-evaluating their actual position. The modes can likely be optimised in some way, but its never going to be perfect. Know that likely you've been the cause of other peoples tail misses, and 15 foot reach on someone elses PC too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The start of this article harps on about how Crisp's opinion was that ADF was not required. The direct quote from Dan in the article was  gt;"[It's] fundamentally incorrect to assert that there were hundreds of ADF staff on offer and somehow, someone said no," This would be a lie if the federal government had already earmarked ADF support for victoria which was then passed down. You could argue that there was an implication of "hundreds of ADF staff" but it sounded like Victoria already factored private security into their response. This is hindsight, but ADF have also been proven to be problematic in outbreaks in our other states. You can hammer the english language any way you like, but if you look at this statment just as hard from the other perspective I dont see how this is a lie.</TEXT>

This update seems so rushed... Rewards not working - Llamma decal dosnt have a blue skin colour alternative. lots of stuff not going smoothly with servers etc.. **Edit2:** Still an issue 16 hours later - anyone know how to raise a support ticket? **Edit 3** Finally worked out that the decal is for the Octane - I did check the Octane ZSR. I dont know if I experienced an issue at all - but this should still be a lesson learnt - the challenge menu should really have an "Equip this decal" button to fix this issue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The current system fulfills those needs if the mega energy just became a lot more readily available outside of eggs. You mean available outside of raids? Unless im so disconnected with mega energy that I didn't now you can get it from eggs now. I agree more ways would be great - but it seems like Niantic is adverse to making mega energy easy to obtain. Also presumably if the pandemic ends before this game gets updated into obscurity by Niantic, raid passes are also a free way to complete mega raids (with other people)</TEXT>
