    <TITLE>Barn upgrades don't actually do anything?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-19 21:21:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>My next barn upgrade is Titanium Barns, but I'm hesitant to start working toward it because my last two barn upgrades didn't actually do crap (it claimed they'd increase storage space . . . nothing doing). Should I just ignore it for now and focus on my steamworks (i.e. is this a feature that's incoming and not active yet), or is this a bug? EDIT: I really appreciate people answering, but the folks who are doing so seem to be MUCH further along in the game than me and I'm not . . . really sure what they're saying. So here's the thing. Before I did any upgrades at all, my barns held 5K Catnip each (along with other supplies, but I'm still at the point where Catnip is the important one). I did an upgrade . . . still 5K each. I built a new barn, thinking maybe this upgrade wasn't retroactive. Still 5K. I did a second upgrade . . . . still at 5K. So do upgrades not actually affect how much your barns can hold? It SAYS it does, but it doesn't actually appear to do so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so. My next upgrades are Silos and the Titanium Barn, but I haven't started making Titanium and don't yet have enough Science for Silos. I'm grinding away on Warehouses one at a time trying to get to my next Barn, and the going is slower than slow--it's taking 2-3 hours to get all the materials for the next one. Is there some way to speed this up?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Getting very close to first reset now, how does selling work?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-11 08:09:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just got the option to research Concrete buildings, 101 kittens, preparing to build my first Factory. But I'm a bit confused by advice I've seen in other threads and I'm hoping someone can help: I've seen advice to sell stuff off in order to quickly boost your resources and take advantage of some kind of "no longer capped" bonus after your reset. But I'm not sure what to sell. Am I supposed to be selling all of my storage, e.g. Barns, Harbours, Warehouses? Or am I supposed to be selling all of my NON-storage, e.g. Observatories, Libraries, Calciners, etc.? And if it's the latter, am I supposed to also sell my housing (e.g. Mansions, Huts, Log Houses)? Once I've sold stuff off, am I then supposed to hoard those resources, or pour them into what I'm supposed to be keeping? Do I want a bunch of assets sitting around when I reset, or do I want stuff as close to zero as possible? Someone please clarify for me, because if it takes me another three days to get to reset I'll be absolutely shocked. This is information I'm going to need very soon.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Bug?] Resetting not providing Paragon?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-21 09:31:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I did my first reset a little under a week ago, and I'm extremely confused. Other people's resets are netting them tons of Paragon. I had one Paragon pre-reset, and although I had over 130 kittens (don't remember the exact number, but it was over 130 and under 140), I still only have one Paragon and only 0.860 Karma. What the what? Has anyone else ever run into this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A reset question I've never seen: What about the second one?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-25 18:44:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we all know there is now an FAQ because of the sheer number of "when do I reset" questions. But having reset once, I'm now approaching the place I previously reset (Concrete Huts) at a rapid pace, such that it seems like resetting here would be pretty ludicrous. What would I gain out of it? Not much, especially as I've shaved almost 2/3 of my time--my first reset was at Year 1850-something (with shutting off the computer at night--most of that is active playtime), and right now I'm on Year 660 and just building up my Observatories so I can get Geology (and that time includes idling overnight). So is there a general guideline for where your SECOND reset should be? Is it just the point where you start feeling the extra Paragon and Karma would help you? Do you reset at Concrete Huts a few times and then zoom through the first part of the game into the Space part? Will it vary by person, or is there consensus on a good place for subsequent resets?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does Kitten Scientists remove the need for a Mint, or is that only true in early game?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-05-10 22:06:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm playing Kitten Scientists so I can idle overnight because I'm at the point where adding new housing and storage costs quite a bit (second reset, just got past Chemistry), and I realized that if I set the script to hunt at full Catpower, let my Furs build up to a few thousand, and then started slowly creating Parchment, I could end up with a never-ending supply of Furs and Parchment. Likewise, I'm at the gamepoint where the only thing I need Ivory for is the happiness bonus and trading with the Nagas, and I've got almost 1M Ivory socked away. (I'd have even more than that, if I hadn't been trading like mad.) Is there just . . . no point to building Mints if you're running Kitten Scientists? Should I even bother? Will I need them later in the game?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do I do now?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-05-11 19:55:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is my first post here, so here's the skinny: One of my friends directed me here after hearing about the fight I'm about to describe. I actually sat in a Starbucks struggling not to cry out of sheer relief because my entire life I've thought my problems are because I have autism, and if I were "normal" I wouldn't have these problems. Hearing that I'm *not* the only one and that it has nothing to do with me and my funny brain and everything to do with choices my mother has made to which there are no good responses . . . it was like being able to breathe for the first time in 26 years, even though I still live with her and escape in the immediate future isn't possible. So when my grandmother died, each girl got an inheritance: one china plate she'd painted, one china doll she'd fired and painted, one vase she'd painted, one of her strings of imitation pearls, and a little bit of costume jewelry. My aunt stole my plate and doll and replaced them with a different doll that had broken parts. My mom has my vase and says I'll get it "when I get a permanent place of my own," which pretty much means "when she dies." I got four pieces of costume jewelry, of which two are unwearable (they're old and contain lead) and one is, or was, broken. My mom promised to have it fixed for me 13 years ago and I haven't seen it since. That leaves my string of pearls (which I had to fight for) and a single pin. It's not worth anything--it's gold-filled with a plain old white enamel rose on it--but it's lovely, and it's the only thing I have that my grandmother chose for me with her own hands. (Do I believe it was sheer chance I got the unwearable jewelry? No. No I do not, especially when my mother--who doesn't wear jewelry--got several full sets, which I'm not even permitted to borrow.) I keep it for special occasions; the first time I wore it was to my sister's wedding, the second was to my high school graduation. It's for those times when what I really want to do is call my grandma and ask for her support, but since she can't be here I have the next best thing. I made the mistake of letting my mother borrow it for a job interview. And now she wants one just like it. She hunted to find one identical, and when she couldn't--this being a pin from the 1960s not marked with a manufacturer and all--she got as close as she possibly could, even after I said I really didn't want her to because it felt like the last special thing I had from my grandmother was being stolen from me. To add insult to injury, the pin she found was on Etsy, and because I have an Etsy account and she doesn't she asked me to buy it for her. Then she asked what she owed me, and in a fit of hurt I texted back to her "not a damn thing. I wanted one thing, just one, that was just mine from Grandma, and I couldn't even have that, so take the damn pin." There was an argument of a magnitude that led to me going to work the next day with a sore throat because I have let her bleed me of everything that means anything to me, and I finally found that one thing she just couldn't have even if it meant I screamed my lungs out. So it's been a week. The pin sits on my dresser because she told me she'd throw it out when it came, and I don't care that it was an eight-dollar pin, I only make eight bucks an hour and she's not throwing it away. She spent four days on vacation and on her return it took less than 12 hours for her to pick a fight--ostensibly because I hadn't planned anything for Mother's Day (conveniently ignoring that I was *working* on Mother's Day), but I've been doing this long enough, and I'm guessing you guys have too, to know what it's really about. Today she showed me two pins she found in a different shape and with a different rose, but similar leaves. On this basis she whined that if it was too similar, well, then, tough. (The first pin she found differed only in the placement of the rose and that there was an additional gold curlicue on it.) I looked at the new pin, which looks nothing like mine, and commented that it was cute. She burst into tears. I have no idea what to do. She refuses to take the second white-enamel pin, and at this point I just want her to *stop crying and yelling* and she could have a damn replica of mine if it would just make her stop. She told me she "thought we were on the same page doing something good together" because while she was looking for a replica of my pin I was looking for something *different* from my pin but from a similar manufacturer--hoping to get her one different from mine so she'd be happy and stop. Now she tells me I overreacted by being hurt because her intention wasn't to hurt me. (As many times as she's said that, I'm not going to believe it until "I'm sorry" actually makes its way out of her mouth. So pretty much, I'm never going to believe it.) That her reason for wanting the exact same damn pin is because "white roses symbolize new beginnings." (Do you know how many pins there are out there with white roses on that don't look like mine? Take a guess. Any number you select will be too small. I know. I looked.) The fact that it's something so special to me, something that means so much to me, was sheerly coincidental, according to her. What do I do? Wait for it to blow over? Cave and keep looking for a replica of my own pin, even though it means I will have absolutely nothing unique and special to me that was chosen for me by my grandmother to carry into my future when she couldn't be with me? I've already taken mine out of my jewelry box and hidden it elsewhere in my room for safety's sake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a relative newbie to the game (about three months-ish?) and have some motor skills problems, which makes me kind of slow on advancing through rhythm games; I've seen folks who started around the same time as me or even later already breezing through FC EX songs, but I'm still in that awkward "I can FC most of the Hard songs I've unlocked, can play SOME EX songs, can play some EX songs with a Stamina team and . . . lol on the rest" stage. So tonight I was playing EX on the Honoka event and hoping for easy songs like Yujo No-Change. And I pulled Anone Ganbare AND ACCIDENTALLY OPTED IN WITH MY SMILE TEAM WHEN I TRIED TO SELECT MY STAMINA TEAM. For the record, my Smile team has a single Stamina member (Maid To Order Maki). Granted, there are four perfect-lock cards, but that doesn't help me much when the notes are this fast. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE I PASSED THE SONG WITH A C RANK AND CAME IN THIRD PLACE. With a team completely undesigned for either a Cool level or an EX one!!! Maybe I really am getting better.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-09-17 23:40:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>So following the maintenance from the last event, my sound went back to normal. I assumed KLab had fixed the sound issue in that maintenance, and went on my merry way. But now I'm starting the current event, *and the problems are back.* They weren't there between events; now they are, even when I'm not playing the event song. It's the same story as it was--music going silent and then picking up later, and on Nawatobi EX--a song I know really well because it's one of my three faves--I can actually tell that it's skipping some of the music. Like--if it disappears on the "na" in "nawatobi" and picks up two beats later, it picks up on the first syllable of the word that follows, instead of on the "bi" where it should be. Then I have to go off-beat to let the notes catch up. I'm on iOS 7/iPhone 5. Is anyone else having this problem where the sound issues specifically disappeared between events? Is it across iOS updates/iPhone platforms? (Android users, I know you guys are having your own whole other set of issues as well, but have you seen this?)</TEXT>

IT'S SO FRIGGING CUTE.) http://i.schoolido.lu/cards/363idolizedMaria.png (Idolized. Fill in the middle with solid rather than sheer fabric and I would find excuses to wear this. I would wear it to the grocery store with matching earrings just to make it more fun to pick out cereal.) http://i.schoolido.lu/cards/168Maria.png (Unidolized.

    <TEXT>Before anybody says "go to the Q amp;A megathread," I want it to be known that I searched four pages of megathreads and couldn't find the current Q amp;A megathread. It is possible I just suck at searching, but I don't think there is one. (If there is, feel free to say "you should've been searching for THIS, dummy" and push me at it with a dunce cap on.) So on EN, my Pure team is pretty pathetic. (It's my weakest team on JP, too, but at least on JP it's competent for a team that was only started two weeks ago. My EN account is something like three months old, it has no excuses.) There's a Pure Nozomi coming up in November on EN, and I've got to tier for her. T1 is the goal, but I'll accept, grudgingly, T2. (Okay, it won't be grudgingly, I'll just be sad to have only the idolized rather than idolized and skill leveled up.) I don't make a whole lot of money, which makes the idea of "I'll just drop a hundred bucks on some gems, no problem" absolutely laughable. Which means lots of grinding to save some up. I'm already going for things like the daily bonuses, S-ranking/S-comboing daily B-sides wherever possible, playing the EX songs to earn the love gem, and so on. My issue is that my other potential source of gems is the S-completion, and I am extremely bad at setting open-ended goals. If I only had 4-5 songs unlocked it wouldn't be so overwhelming, but during this last event I leveled up enough to unlock Loneliest Baby. That's a lot of songs. Does anybody have any tips for how to set love gem grinding goals? Should I start with my songs that already have A-completion? Try to get everything up to A-completion and then go for blood? Space out my plays among all the songs? PLEASE SEND ASSISTANCE, WE ARE TRAPPED.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EDIT: I GOT MY DRAGON SCALES I wanted to post an update (last one). About three days ago I finally couldn't take it anymore--it was getting really bad, on levels I won't describe because it's gross--and soaked my fingers in bleach. It's a last-resort, "this is like the last thing you ever want to do to your body on purpose if you can help it" kind of treatment, *but it worked.* By the end of my work shift I had patches of "dragon scales" all over my fingers, which is what happens when the rash goes "Screw this, I'm out of here" and dries up all at once (as bleach is wont to do) and just leaves these thick pads of skin it killed. And they literally look like dragon scales, which is why I call them that. (For a few days after you get them you can actually tap them with a pencil or an unaffected part of your skin, *and you won't feel anything*. It's so weird.) I'm a couple thousand points from Hanayo and my hands are almost as good as new. I thought for a day or two I wasn't going to make it, and I was ready to send my transfer code screenshot to my backup when I woke up with hands that no longer felt like a swarm of angry bees and *oh it was wonderful.* Two of the 20 million players gems later I was caught up to where I needed to be to make the casual-play SR at my pace, without feeling like I'd had to dip into the gems I have hoarded for Nozomi. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH for having my back. Knowing you were here if I needed it meant so much--it's easier to play even when you're in pain when you know someone's pulling for you.</TEXT>

I'd hit them and get misses, with my phone acting like I hadn't even touched the screen. At first I chalked it up to still being a relatively new/mediocre EX player, but then I compared my score on Music S.T.A.R.T. with other songs of similar difficulty and something didn't seem right--namely, I might get bads or goods on those notes rather than greats or perfects, but I should be hitting at least *most* of them closely enough to register as having been hit, rather than 80-90% of them registering as misses. So today, now that the event's over, I decided to indulge my curiosity and prepared to sacrifice some LP. Sure enough, if I hit that first long note head-on and hold it, I'm fine--but if I let my finger slide, this glitch activates and other notes will stop registering at random. (I'm not good enough yet to say for certain that it's *only* long notes being affected this way--a miss could be a glitch, but I'm only just graduating to getting goods and up with no misses.) Has anybody else encountered this, on this or other songs? I mean, it shouldn't break the game as long as you're not butterfingers like me, but . . . what's going on?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-10-27 21:28:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>SO. I'm playing this Score Match on EX for the first time ever--by which I mean "I intend to play it entirely on EX, unless my LP dictates that a Hard level is in order before work/bed." And last night I clicked EX and got put on Baby Maybe Koi no Button. Played through. And then stared at the screen in SHOCK. All Perfects and Greats with only a single Good? What the actual what? I ALMOST FULL COMBOED IT. So I went to play on EX again. Dodged a couple of times trying to get back to Koi no Button, because I literally could not believe what just happened. Finally pulled it up, and my hands were shaking so hard--DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN WHAT WHAT WHAT--that I set my PL team more or less as insurance. It's still mostly low-level and doesn't activate often, but having it set made me feel a little better. Turns out I didn't need it. I GOT MY FIRST EX FULL COMBO AS THE SECOND SONG OF THE EVENT. You guys, I did it!!! I FC'ED AN EX!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Luck] I wanted to strengthen my Pure team in preparation for the Nozomi event, so I took a deep breath and risked it. WORTH IT.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-28 02:07:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So none of these are my best girl, alas. But let me give you the state of my Pure team just so you can understand how pathetic it is: I have two of the initial Rare Nozomis that kind of look like Valentine's outfits (I forget which song that outfit is from, but you guys probably know the one I mean), and I've been waiting to practice them together because even with those duplicate Nozomis I don't have enough Pures to make a whole team--there are two Smile SRs tagging on at the end, and for SRs, only the two swimsuit girls we got over the summer (both unidolized). When I say my Pure team is pathetic given how long I've been playing, that's *kind.* Today I saw the Pure Attribute box. I had 92 love gems saved up for Fairy Nozomi, and I've been told I should easily be able to T1 with only 40-50 gems. Even, I reasoned, if I couldn't earn back that last eight gems by the time the event starts, I could use the ones I earn during the event to supplement, and buying ten gems hurts my wallet a *heck* of a lot less than buying, you know, fifty. So I took the plunge. [This is going to transform my entire team.](http://imgur.com/hfweJYQ) Two SRs, both of which should be able to oust those Smile SRs before they even reach Level Thirty! The Rin I got three of is new to my account in spite of looking like she belongs to a rather old team--I can both Idolize her and level her up right away. I've previously idolized the maid Nico, but accidentally practiced her away before max-leveling--I've had one copy of her sitting here for days, trying to regular-scout another. She can also be Idolized and leveled, so I can level another card that's more powerful. Same story with the Umi--I'm not exactly sure where she disappeared to, but at some point I had her, and I no longer do. I already had one of her in my inventory, though, so she's now re-Idolized again, and while I already have that Hanayo Idolized and max-leveled, she's one of the most powerful girls on my team--plenty enough to help power me up by being a duplicate until I can level her into the version of her I already have. All I need now is more G and more Ns to practice with. I can't wait!</TEXT>

Today while playing I've gotten three Rares via the "congrats, you cleared a song" rewards: one of the initial Makis, and two of the same Hanayo again. She's like a perpetual skill-leveling machine.

    <TEXT>So the other day someone said they wanted to play Junai Lens without hearing it 83957285738723 times, and I suggested "Welcome to New York" by Taylor Swift as having a similar beat. There are a few favorites I use that are similar (sometimes eerily exact) to the SIF beatmaps. (I should note I've only tested these on Hard.) I time them by hitting "play" when the album art comes up at the beginning of each Live: Snow Halation -- gt; Some Folks by Alice Cooper After School Navigators -- gt; Uprising by Muse (HAHAHAHA) Susume - gt; Tomorrow -- gt; Someone Like You by Adele No Brand Girls -- gt; Cartoon Heroes by Aqua Wonder Zone -- gt; Magic by Olivia Newton-John Anone Ganbare -- gt; Down The Rabbit Hole by Adam Lambert Eien Friends -- gt; Tik Tok by Kesha (confirmed to work on all three difficulties) Binetsu Kara Mystery -- gt; Mitternacht by E Nomine Donna Tokimo Zutto -- gt; She's A Rebel by Green Day Ai Wa Taiyo Jyanai? -- gt; Goodbye To The Circus by Aqua Oh, Love  amp; Peace! -- gt; So Long by ABBA Wonderful Rush -- gt; Truly Madly Deeply by Savage Garden (WARNING: although the beat matches, early parts of the beatmap will seem weirdly fast compared to the slow pace of the song. Consider it a challenge mode!) Sweet  amp; Sweet Holiday -- gt; Bad from Little Shop of Horrors (movie version; fast-forward to the end of the line "over my dead body!" around 20 seconds in, pause here, then start the game and restart the song) And now the one all the completionists are going to love me for: If you hit play immediately *after* the album art disappears, Pink's "Raise Your Glass" is a perfect beat-for-beat match for Yujo No-Change. You're welcome. Anybody else have songs they swap in that they'd like to share? (Expect me to keep adding 'em, I'm trying to hoard tokens right now and I can't take the cuteness anymore.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Super Mario 64--lost bugs, rooms, cutscenes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-22 08:25:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm going to begin with the "implausible as hell, but what else could it be?" explanation I've had for this for years. (You'll quickly see why I think it may be ME, instead.) Then we'll do a rundown of the changes I'm looking for confirmation/denial of. So this might get a bit lengthy, sorry. So first, I described this game several years ago to a group of hardcore gamer geeks. The kind who do things like combing source code for fun and cataloguing cool glitches and unreleased cutscenes for us mere plebs who find them interesting but can't code. I figured if anybody could explain it it'd be them, and they had a go at it, but admitted their solution didn't make much sense even to them. What they came up with is "somehow, some way, you owned a partially-debugged beta copy of this game that would play on a regular Nintendo 64." Here's where that theory falls apart: 1) Beta cartridges in the N64 time period were not made to play on "standard" machines, nor did they come in the same shiny market packaging as normal cartridges. As per this same group of geeks, you had to own a special testing machine because of the possibility of horribly gamebreaking bugs damaging a regular machine. 2) Cartridges available for purchase were mass-produced. There's no way you'd end up with a single cartridge that randomly had completely different programming on it. 3) One of these geeks very kindly went through the source code of both an English and Japanese rom and couldn't find any evidence of the cutscene I'll describe below, nor anything that would indicate the possibility of the glitch related to the cutscene. He was actually really excited and offered me $10k plus a replacement cartridge on the spot if I would sell him my "beta" cartridge, as no known English beta copies of SM64 survive and even a partially-debugged "how the hell did this happen" cartridge would be of massive value to video game historians. (Needless to say the cartridge was damaged beyond recovery long before the offer was made, or I wouldn't have so many student loans now.) So far, so good. We have a game my mother purchased at Radio Shack in 1996, new in box in a companion deal with the N64, and the only possible explanation a group of super-hardcore geeks could come up with is what's above. I'll describe here the content available in that cartridge that is NOT in the Wii digital console port nor either of the two N64 cartridges I've owned since. Some of it will unfortunately be incomplete because 1996 was a very long time ago, but quite a few of these memories are very vivid to me (I've even done weeks-long playthroughs trying everything I could think of to activate this content, to no avail). 1) The thing that first led to the "you have a beta copy" theory: there were sprites in my copy of the game that were different from a standard cartridge. One of the geeks trying to help me solve this mystery asked if I'd ever seen stills from the beta, and I confirmed I had not. He then proceeded to send me some demo footage and stills from the beta, and I caused a minor uproar on a message board by excitedly announcing THAT'S IT THAT'S THE ENEMY I REMEMBER when looking at a small pink sprite originally slated for Lethal Lava Land. These alternate sprites appeared in a few different levels, although Lethal Lava Land is the only one I can confirm as "yes, I definitely saw these other enemies there". I also identified Bowser's sub from Dire, Dire Docks as having a different design--which also matched the beta. 2) The slide outside the Dire, Dire Docks room was accessible. There were two "secret exits" from Hazy Maze Cave, one inside the maze and one inside the Metal Cap room, and entering either one would cause Mario to slide down the slide and under the teal wall. The one in the maze was particularly insidious--it was placed inside one of the three "fresh air shelters," and was impossible to distinguish from the door that actually led you out of the maze. If you picked the wrong shelter and the wrong door, you had to start over. 3) Standing on the main staircase, five steps down, and doing a Pound the Ground would drop you into a room below (not onto the basement staircase). In most cases it was black space similar to the well-known glitch involving the top tower and the Wing Cap, but at least twice I found my way into an *actual room* there with a brick ceiling and walls. There was a painting in this version of the room, although I don't recall it allowing entrance to a playable level. Many years ago I discovered (via a glitch guide) the glitch where you could phase through the side of the staircase and make the camera move freely instead of having to use preset angles, and got super-excited because I thought it had to be related to the room under the stairs--only to see the glitch guide say the glitch worked because there was nothing there. 4) There was a seventh Star in Lethal Lava Land (or maybe more accurately I should say "the Stars changed"). Instead of having to do that gravity-defying balance act in the bottom right corner of the world to get to a Star, you had to fight a Bully there; there was a balance Star as well, but it was located elsewhere in the level, and wasn't set up the same way as the one in the current game. I looked up today what little surviving beta footage exists to refresh my memory, and Lethal Lava Land originally had a very different layout that would be consistent with at least one of these Stars (but not with the way the level was laid out in my memory). 5) There was a fourth slide. I don't remember where, although my brain is suggesting it was a "hidden slide" in Cool, Cool Mountain. (No, this is not the "frozen wood" slide that brings you out in the cabin. It's a different slide entirely.) This is sort of fragmented in my memory--I remember being on it when I was eight, and I remember searching for it when I did a 100% playthrough in college and being incredibly frustrated because I knew I couldn't finish the game at 100% without it, but the actual location or what you had to accomplish on this slide is lost to me. In setup it was probably closest to the one from Tall, Tall Mountain, but is definitely *not* that slide--see #7 below. 6) Wing Mario Over The Rainbow had a different title screen. It showed "Rainbow Ride" at the bottom as it would for the correspondent level on the other side of the main room, then a single spinning Star (as though you'd entered an entirely new level) with "Wing Mario Over The Rainbow" as the title of the Star. 7) In my first playthrough when I was eight, I didn't get very far. Reasons for this include "3D gaming was an extremely new thing and having a full-range playing field changed how we'd previously thought about video games" and "I was eight years old." I did, however, have a mom who was pretty cool about games, and she played with me for quite some time before losing interest. Thus, I had access to areas you wouldn't normally expect an eight-year-old to reach, like the second floor. I remember being extremely startled when I replayed the game at age 16 and found the slide in Tall, Tall Mountain--it was one of my favorite levels as a kid, one of the few I was really good at, and I swear when I was eight years old there was no slide. No, this did not have to do with not being able to perform the Long Jump across the waterfall--I couldn't Long Jump *consistently,* but I could do it, and explored all parts of the mountain on my own. 8) There was some kind of glitch that would prevent the Big Boos from appearing out back. I don't remember how it was activated, but it was most certainly a thing. 9) No hidden Red Coins level in the Jolly Roger Bay room, nor even the holes in the wall for it. 10) This is the bit that's most inexplicable to me, and it's going to be a two-parter. In Dire, Dire Docks, there's a level called Board Bowser's Sub. In the game as it exists now, this sub disappears after the first level and a giant hole appears in the wall below the waterline. Nothing changes that. In the game as I remember it, the sub was a different sprite (this also matched the beta) and completing the Star actually activated a cutscene--the sub going underwater, ramming the wall, surfacing in the moat, tearing the bridge to pieces and fleeing across the pond. One of the geeks attempting to help me identify what this cartridge might be went through both English and Japanese source code--the cutscene doesn't exist. I don't mean it's not in the final game, I mean there's no code that would indicate a scene was there and got dummied out, either. 11) Related to #10: game-breaking bug. In this version of the game, performing Pound the Pillars before Board Bowser's Sub would leave the sub in the level, and make it impossible to retrieve some future Stars. You'd still get the cutscene, but when you re-entered the level the sub would still be there. Again: nothing in the source code indicates this glitch should be possible, and indeed video-game physics don't work this way (although you come out in the moat if you swim through the hole in the wall, there is no need for an actual physical path to exist for a sprite that disappears between levels). There would literally be no need to code this in except to make the game harder. 12) Not my copy specifically: I distinctly remember rumors about being able to find a playable Luigi in the game, and Shigeru Miyamoto straight-up saying in an interview that Luigi was never intended to be in the game. Today when I went looking for beta footage to take some stills for this post, I found an interview stating the exact *opposite*--that Luigi was intended to be in the game, but hardware limitations made it impossible. Does anybody else remember *any* of this? Any at all? Did I lose my mind years ago, or is this potentially how SM64 actually looked in another reality?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My legs aren't that long</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-26 05:35:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was 16 years old, biking home from Taco Bell with lunch. This was a rare treat because of my family's small income, so I had a ton of energy focused on carefully balancing three drinks and two bags of food from my handlebars. Close to home, I had to cross a highway intersection. It's worth mentioning that I grew up in a rural town, so "highway" sort of translates to "two lanes with a yellow line down the middle," but at this point you're still talking two lanes and a turning lane. I dutifully got off my bike, rebalanced all my drinks, and started across on the WALK sign. I was somewhere in the turning lane when a pickup in the wrong lane ran the red light well over the speed limit. This was a full-size pickup, probably a 350 or 450--the top of the grille was over my head--and I thought, very clearly, *I'm going to die* and screamed out of pure reflex. The grille was close enough for me to touch without stretching my hand out . . . . . . and then I was standing on the sidewalk, my tray of drinks sitting neatly at my feet with not a single drop spilled, my bike next to me with the kickstand down, with this giant truck barreling past me. I'm not even sure the guy saw me. I was standing in the middle of the road--in fact, the only reason this clown nearly hit me is because he apparently thought "that lane in the middle with the arrows down the middle, yup, that's definitely the lane I need if I want to keep driving straight on." There's no way I jumped an entire highway lane (and then some) from a near-standstill, in a long skirt, with a bicycle and a tray full of large drinks, only to land in the position I ended up in. It's not possible. Bags would have flown off my handlebars, the drinks would have fallen, my skirt would have torn, the bike would have been dragged or caught on the pickup, I probably would have fallen and scraped my hands or knees, there are lots of possibilities, but "I standing-jumped 20-30 feet and landed perfectly upright with everything neat as a pin" is not one of them. So far, so creepy, but it gets creepier still because someone else saw it. The sidewalk at that point has this little . . . mini-garden, I guess you'd call it, made out of concrete slabs about as tall as a curb, and I sat down on this "second curb" because I was shaking too hard to stand (also hyperventilating, which I think is a perfectly rational response to almost becoming roadkill). This lady from the other side of the light careered into the gas station on that corner as soon as the light turned green, got out of her car, came running up to me and said "oh my god, are you okay? I thought he hit you. I swear I saw him hit you. There was blood and I thought--you're okay? Are you okay? He didn't hit you?" I was breathing too hard to speak, so she pulled my dad's drink out of my tray and made me sip it. There's nothing quite like the taste of a soft drink you hate to bring you back to reality, so finally I was able to tell her I wasn't hit, there wasn't so much as a spoke out of place on my bike and I was only a block from home and if she'd help me get back on and get my drinks balanced it was sidewalks and a residential back road all the way. It's been eleven years and I still have no idea: what the hell?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Theory] The PODS Effect</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-04 20:34:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>So first, I need to explain the origin of "The PODS Effect" before I can explain how this relates to the Mandela Effect. "PODS Effect" was sort of an in-joke with people at my university, and it began with a story my college advisor told me. It's named for her discovery of PODS (those giant portable storage units), and someone mentioning them to her completely independently in the same day. PODS Effect works as follows: 1) You discover a fact, item, program, etc. We'll say you just discovered the TV show NCIS. Good enough. 2) Within 24 hours, someone who does not know about your discovery will mention the fact, item, program, etc. in a context completely unrelated to your discovery. (e.g.: "I love your hair!" "Thanks! I got the style from Abby on NCIS.") This is different from Blue Car Syndrome, in which something is brought to your attention and you henceforth notice it more (named for the phenomenon in which you buy a blue car, and then have difficulty finding your car in a parking lot because you never noticed before how many blue cars are out there). Could PODS Effect be one potential cause of Mandela Effect, or diverging/merging universes trying to "correct" themselves by hammering home the new reality?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I called it a "religious experience" then, but . . .</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-05 04:37:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm going to start by saying there will be some discussion of 9/11 from a personal standpoint in this post, so if that kind of thing is troublesome for you, please skip this one. The day and the time of this glitch can be very well documented: 11 September 2001, sometime between 6 and 8pm EST. I was barely thirteen years old, homeschooled, and I'd spent the day cleaning the entire house in a terrifying show of efficiency. My sister worked two blocks from the Pentagon and my then-best friend lived very close to the original reported location of United 93, and I had one of those weird ideas you get when your brain is trying to cope with massive trauma: "If I just keep cleaning, they won't be dead." [Both of them are alive and well, but I didn't know that at the time.] Around 4pm I got a phone call from my pastor: members of the church were holding a vigil that night and he knew my sister was in DC, and if I wanted to come pray he or his wife would pick me up. I did, of course. Ours was a very tiny church, so to make a prayer circle we literally just picked up the pulpit and altars and moved them out of the way. To put what's coming into perspective, we once had 90 people in the church and we had to move a third of the group downstairs and have them listen into the sermon via baby monitors from the nursery. There was literally *no room to spare.* So we have about 20 people in a circle, on their knees; mostly adults, only two or three teens and nobody under the age of 12. It's not an impossible fit, but it's crowded. And then somebody put their hands on my shoulders. I assumed--as one is wont to do in a church where laying on of hands is practiced--that they were praying for my sister. But I happened to open my eyes, because keeping them closed too long with people mumbling around me was likely to put me to sleep, and realized I didn't know the person who had his hands on my shoulders--nor was he some random passerby from town. As a matter of fact he was wearing a robe, and curly-pointed shoes, and had an extremely long beard. I looked up, intending to say something to the other people in the prayer circle, and realized there were no less than 200 people somehow inside the front quarter of a sanctuary that seated 67: women with their hair covered, men in Jewish prayer shawls, people in clothing made of threads far thicker and coarser than any I'd ever seen in a store. Dirty, cracked nails; dry skin. These were not people from rural USA, 2001. And although they were not speaking English, I could understand perfectly that they were also praying for us and with us: for the loved ones we were still uncertain of, for the lives lost, for the sense of doom that hung over us all as we wondered if the very world was ending. That's a lot to take in when you're in eighth grade, so I left the prayer circle and went out to our wheelchair ramp to get some air. Shortly thereafter a second group of parishioners showed up to relieve the first group, with the intention that we would have someone praying through the night, and our piano lady came outside to see if I was okay. I asked if she'd seen the other people in the sanctuary. Not only did she indicate she had not, she had no idea who I was talking about. At the time, I assumed I'd been sent some kind of comforting religious vision--something along the lines of "everyone on earth and in heaven is praying with you." But now that I'm older and a lot less religious, I find that idea hard to credit--even though I know the event happened. What do y'all make of it?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-03-07 06:09:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Literally just now. Playing video games with my Pandora on, headphones in, and "No Good Deed" from Wicked comes on. First line after the opening chanting: "Let his flesh not be torn, let his blood leave no stain, when they beat him let him feel no pain." It jarred me right away, because I was given my first copy of Wicked about a month-ish after the OBCR came out. (That's about 12 years I've been listening to this, for non-fans keeping track at home. I have always, *always* known this lyric as "let his flesh never tear." But I just listened to the copy on my computer and my copy of the workshop, and nope--both say "flesh not be torn." AZLyrics agrees. What makes this even weirder is that "not be torn" doesn't make sense from a repetition standpoint. "Let his blood *leave,* let him *feel,* may his bones never *break,* let him never *die*," all very simple and strong infinitive verbs. "Not be torn" isn't the same kind of speech (I think it's an irregular participle, but the exact grammar really doesn't matter--it's not an infinitive is the point). "Never tear" is the one that fits repetitively with the rest of the lyrics. Have I sung this song incorrectly literally thousands of times, including (oh god would this be embarrassing) as an audition piece? Or has anybody else noticed this, too?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Who is the dude in my lobby at work, and why does he keep talking to me???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-12 09:55:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so, I work at a Taco Bell. You've been in one before. If you're not from the United States, think McDonald's for similar ambiance. The Ritz they ain't, but they're wide-open and bright and easy to see in. A favorite game in our store is to get on the headset and tell whoever's running front cash "hey, someone's in lobby!" and then laugh when they haul ass up there only to find nobody there. (We're a bunch of assholes, I can't defend us.) But about three weeks ago someone said this to me and I'd actually gotten as far in greeting as "Hi! Sorry for the wait--" when I realized I was addressing a stack of trays I'd washed and not put away yet. Except I wasn't. I was talking to a very tanned white man about 6'2" with brown hair, khakis, and a dark polo shirt, dammit, and I've seen him well over two dozen times since. I've seen ghosts in the past, and this isn't like that--it's more like when you were a little kid and screamed to your mom that there was a monster in the closet, and when she flipped on the light the "monster" was actually your jacket with the hood shoved back. The difference is that unlike the aforementioned jacket, 1) I've worked here over a year and I'm quite familiar with what our counter looks like, there's no reason I'd suddenly start mistaking a rather short POS system for a rather tall customer 2) I've seen this dude from multiple angles. It's not something on the counter that's conveniently dude-shaped--I've been in the lobby wiping tables and seen him from behind, I've been working on the line and seen him from a 45-degree angle, and a few days ago I saw him as I was walking into the building and when I got through the door he wasn't there anymore. All this is weird enough, but I've also *heard* the guy. You need to understand that there are only five guys on our staff, and I've heard this very distinctly male voice on nights when we were running an all-female crew. "Yo, anybody back there?" "Hi!" and weirdest of all, someone placing an order--when nobody was standing at the POS, and the entire lobby was empty (in fact, at least twice I've seen him when our lobby was closed and all the doors locked). And these aren't like the kinds of "hearing voices" you associate with some mental illnesses--this dude is clearly having a conversation I'm hearing, but not part of, and it's a conversation that lines up perfectly with where I see him. Older members of the sub might remember the days before digital telephones were the norm, where you could pick up your phone and hear someone else talking. This is like that. TL;DR there is apparently a glitched-out NPC standing at my front register, only I can see and hear him, wtaf???</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Remembering "backward"? (Or: a giant ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-24 21:38:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so I'll explain this via an example first. I'm wondering if this might be related to glitches in some way. There's this game I play called LoveLive School Idol Festival. It's a rhythm game based on an anime/idol group, which has songs written specifically for it--the idol group doesn't do covers. Two of the songs in the game are "Private Wars" and "Dancing Stars on Me!", and I have the weirdest feeling every time I play those levels--it feels like they want to trigger a memory from when I was three or four years old, if I could just. Remember. What. It. Was. The kicker here is, LoveLive came out in 2013. I was born in 1988. There's no way these Japanese songs have anything to do with my early, All-American childhood. "Dancing Stars on Me!" does have a very 80s-sounding opening (in fact it specifically reminds me of "Everlasting Love"), but "Private Wars" doesn't even have that kind of "oh, yes, I see they were going for a retro feel here" connection to be made. If we assume time isn't linear, though, that problem disappears. I started watching (badly-dubbed, highly-Americanized) anime when I was six, and LoveLive is absolutely the kind of show that would have appealed to me. Perhaps in some way I remembered backward--as a child, I "remember" this stuff that didn't come out yet because time isn't linear and in some way it *had* already come out. Does anybody else have memories like this? You know you *can't* possibly remember that thing/event/experience/etc., and yet somehow you do. Or perhaps you feel like a memory *should* be there, but it's not--like those doors in old houses that were placed for symmetry rather than function and just open onto brick walls. (For the record, LoveLive songs are not the only ones where I've experienced this. "Kiss From A Rose" by Seal makes me smile not because it's a favorite, but because it reminds me of something good. I don't know what it's reminding me of, but it was nice.)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-04-12 22:01:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realize that by definition this starts with "when I was a kid . . . " and is thus somewhat suspect, but please bear with me, because I feel like I can't be the only person this has happened to. So, I hang out on Tumblr, and as you may expect if you're also a Tumblr denizen I have a dash full of Steven Universe fans. And this is how I encountered [Sugilite](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/d/d2/Sugilite_-_Cry_for_Help_with_Flail.png/revision/latest?cb=20151213211659). So here's the thing, I've watched exactly three episodes of Steven Universe, none of which had Sugilite in them, and yet when stills of her first turned up on my dash I went "holy shit, where do I remember this character from?" and instantly had the very strong feeling I'd seen her before *as a child.* Given how very 1980s her design is, I thought "oh, of course, she must be designed as an homage to something I watched back in the day, mystery solved." Except . . . not really? Because I can't find *anything* I watched back-in-the-day with a character resembling Sugilite. (Before anybody suggests it: I was just a little bit too young to have watched *Jem and the Holograms,* and didn't discover Jem existed until I was in college.) And yet I'm *positive* I saw such a character at some point before I got past second grade or so. I briefly considered the possibility that some version of Steven Universe existed in some way in another universe when I was little, but after discussion with some SU-loving friends this theory doesn't really hold up--the show contains homoromantic themes that would never have passed muster with the censors in 1993, and features multiple character designs and subplots that are clearly reliant on its creators having been part of 1990s American anime culture. Indeed, huge chunks of the main plot would be impossible had the creators never seen *Sailor Moon,* which didn't come out in the US until 1994 (and only began in 1992 in Japan). My theory, then, is that Sugilite is an homage to a character *who didn't exist in this timeline," making this an ME that only has half a pair. Has anybody else experienced things like this? Song references to things that no longer exist, shows you know were spinoffs but the original doesn't seem to be here, etc.?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Soft Scrub color change?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-15 10:01:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so yesterday. Cleaning out our undersink cabinet, putting away supplies, and I found a bottle of Soft Scrub gel that's DARK BROWN. Here's the thing, I grew up in a house with white Formica countertops. I remember when the bottle changed from green to white because the company was updating the logos (accompanied with NEW AND IMPROVED on the bottle and all that jazz, no Mandela effect there), but in my memory it's *always* been either green or white. We had to bleach our countertops twice a week because my mom was paranoid about raw meat and the Formica was quite old (it literally stained if you set a coffee cup on it), so I had reason to be very familiar with the Soft Scrub bottle. There are some new versions with a teal bottle, but given that it's an all-new product in the line that doesn't surprise me. What *does* surprise me is this sudden dark brown bottle--it looks absolutely *nothing* like anything I've ever seen as part of the Soft Scrub line, and the dark brown clashes horribly with the teal/green/yellow logo. And Mom claims she got this bottle when she and Daddy first moved to this house, but that's impossible--I've cleaned out the undersink before (as in "everything comes out, wipe the bottom clean, put it all back") and never seen it. What the heck, Soft Scrub???</TEXT>

    <TITLE>'cause I'm Mr. Brightside</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-21 09:31:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this is sort of a Mandela effect in reverse. On Tumblr, there's this post that goes around sometimes that asks the question "does anyone ever actually learn the lyrics to Mr. Brightside or are we all just born knowing it?" Presumably this post is meant to be tongue in cheek, but when I first read it I stopped cold and went "but wait . . . . " So here's the skinny. I remember hearing Mr. Brightside exactly one time before 2009. It was at a school dance in a cafeteria with horrible acoustics and a deejay who thought more bass = better music, so my first experience with the song was basically "BADADADADA CAGE BADADADADADA WANNALL BADADAA KISS BADADADADA SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE." You really couldn't hear it for shit, and it was mostly the beat of the song that made me recognize it later. A brief interlude: in high school, and through most of college, I was the kind of nerd who only listened to showtunes, video game soundtracks, and Japanese rock. Someone is going to tell me "oh, you must have heard it somewhere else," and my reply is going to be "where, the Final Fantasy album I took my Directing final music from?" I literally *did not listen* to anything post-1995 or so unless it was from Broadway. Back to the story: we're now in a gas station in 2009 and I'm listening to this super-shitty radio I convinced my boss would make the store "friendlier to customers." (Reality: do you know how fucking boring it is to work at a gas station in complete silence when three hours might go by before you see someone?) The song comes on. I should emphasize *I did not even know the name of the song.* I just started singing along with it and only at the end did I go " . . . who *sings* that, anyway?" I literally *did* know the words to Mr. Brightside before I had any reason to have meaningfully engaged with the song. And not only that, I mentioned the post to my best friend and she had no idea what the song was until I went "I'm coming outta my cage and I've been--", and she replied by singing the next line. She, too, knew all the words but not the name of the song or band, and couldn't remember a time when she didn't. Anybody else experience stuff like this? Not just deja vu, but deja vu that seems to be shared by large numbers of people? (Anybody else inexplicably know the words to Mr. Brightside?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay. So this is more surmise and less "please actually throw a 30-page manifesto at me," but speaking specifically about those who think the Mandela Effect is some kind of conspiracy: Okay, but *why?* Let me put it another way. If I say, for example . . . "Lee Harvey Oswald was in the pay of the CIA, who wanted Kennedy killed." There are lots of potential reasons for this. Kennedy very nearly pushed us into nuclear war and could have been seen as a threat; Kennedy was pushing for integration, which was dangerous and controversial; Kennedy had multiple affairs, and may have been considered a security leak for McCarthy's list of supposed communists. There were lots of reasons to assassinate Kennedy, is what I'm saying, and it doesn't necessarily sound like I'm sitting here in a tinfoil hat if I say "I don't know that it was some *Mission: Impossible* style plot, but I do believe there may be more to the case than we know about, and god do those missing frames in the Zagruder film grind my gears." So okay, let's assume the Mandela Effect is in fact some kind of conspiracy. Mind control, altering the matrix, whatever. In god's name, *why?* Sure, some Mandela Effects would have huge impacts on world relations (Mandela and Castro, for example), but I'm pretty sure it makes zero difference to my life trajectory if I grew up eating Kit-Kats and reading about the Berenstein Bears instead of eating Kitkats and reading about the Berenstain Bears. Why bother with such apparently worthless changes, especially if secrecy would seem to be desirable by the very concept of being a conspiracy?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Attention, Duelists: An Unusual Request</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-08 20:53:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I apologize for making this my first post (I actually didn't even know this sub existed until a couple of days ago). I did clear it with the mods, and I'll try to keep it short. I recently started a project on Tumblr for my nephew, Bubbie. Due to medical negligence when he was eight years old, Bubbie was left profoundly disabled--we were told first that he'd never wake up, then that he wouldn't recognize us, then that he wouldn't be able to feed himself . . . you get the idea. Turns out, he's our miracle kid. This month he's graduating high school. Bubbie adores Yu-Gi-Oh--he's only ever seen the dubs and can't see or read well enough to follow subtitles, but he loves the original characters, and he freaking *loves* the card game. Although he can't duel even with first-generation lore, he loves sorting and playing with his cards and looking at the artwork. For his high school graduation, I've been asking folks with extra YGO cards to send him cards (both the dueling kind and the graduation kind) this month--YGO and mail are two of his favorite things. The response on Tumblr has been incredibly generous, with a few dozen folks from seven countries offering to send Bubbie cards and sketches of his favorite monsters, but I'd love to make this as huge as I can. Bubbie is a special-needs boy in a tiny town, and his world is very small; I'd like to make it as big as I can. You can read the original post about The Great Big Yugioh Project [here](http://prismatic-bell.tumblr.com/post/143447369296/its-time-to-d-d-d-do-something-awesome), and see his reaction to the first packages [here](http://prismatic-bell.tumblr.com/post/143865788761/more-cards-more-pics-i-cant-get-over-that) and [here](http://prismatic-bell.tumblr.com/post/143600685746/attention-duelists-the-first-packages-have). Can y'all help me out? If you're interested, I have his address available via PM (I don't want to just post it in a permanent location on the internet, because who knows where it might end up). Thank you for reading! EDIT: a few folks have expressed some (understandable) concern about whether I actually know Bubbie, and if he's actually disabled. I promised to provide some proofs when I got home from work, so here we go. This took a bit of doing, because the only picture I have of Bubbie *with* me is 1) over ten years old and both of us are pretty much unrecognizable, and 2) buried in a shoebox somewhere in a garage full of crap from our last three moves that has never been unpacked. He lives in Oklahoma, I live in Phoenix, he has hundreds of seizures a day and can't travel, so there's not much opportunity for photos. (I'm going to OKC in November; it'll be our first pictures together since he was a baby.) So first, [here's a screenshot of my sister's first reaction post](http://imgur.com/SS1A1IM) to Bubbie's first day of mail. You'll be able to see some of the same photos that are in my reaction post above, but more importantly, you can see that I can access her Facebook. Next, [the Six Degrees of Bubbie](http://imgur.com/q4NGbJC). I know my mom has pictures of herself with Bubbie *somewhere* (and by "somewhere" I mean "probably on her phone, where she will forget to upload them until the stupid thing crashes and she goes "oh no, I had so many pictures on there!"), but I can't find them. I took the second-best option: the base picture is my mom and I, and on the right is my mom with my sister and my sister with Bubbie. You can compare the me in the photo to the me [here](http://prismatic-bell.tumblr.com/post/136363422881/come-on-put-on-your-war-paint). And finally, [proof of Bubbie's participation in Special Olympics](http://imgur.com/HYaxs5j). These are from this year's event, and you can see one of the medals in the picture of his winnings around his neck in the picture of him with his Olympics partner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello everyone! Exactly what it says on the tin. I've been using one of these for months, and one I used to use, stopped, and recently started again. SO LET'S BEGIN, SHALL WE? I've got two apps for you, ReceiptPal and ReceiptHog. Very simple: you make a purchase, you take a picture of the receipt, the apps check the data on the receipt for marketing and such and you earn points (on Pal) or coins (on Hog). X number of points will earn you a gift card (on Pal) or real, cold, hard cash via PayPal (on Hog). You can use the same receipts on both apps, and Pal even lets you forward e-receipts (as long as they're in English)! It does take awhile to accumulate enough points for the $25 iTunes card on Pal, but seriously. Free money. Worth the five minutes a week to fill your points cards. I know both of these are available for iOS in the US; I think Pal is also on Google Play, and Hog *might* be in some other countries. (I have never lived in another country, I'm sorry.) Enjoy, lovelies!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-05-24 10:17:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so. Let me explain what I'm talking about first. When I was a kid, there was this super-cool two-screen theatre in my town. It had an "adults" side and a "kids" side, and the idea was that you could drop your kids on the "kids" side to watch a children's flick, then go watch whatever on the other screen. (It was the early 1990s, in a town so tiny nobody locked their doors. I actually remember walking into a neighbor's house and leaving a cup of sugar on her counter because my mom had borrowed some, and the neighbor wasn't at home for me to return it in person.) Obviously, most kids' movies do not make up the runtime of a movie aimed at adults, so until I was six or so I got to see movies in the coolest way possible--they still did cartoons before them, and sometimes they did little things after them that today we'd call "DVD featurettes." One I remember seeing was this explanation of how green screen was used in *The Indian in the Cupboard.* So in this theatre, I saw a version of *The Lion King* that was decidedly *not* the one I brought home on VHS. It featured a far more graphic death for Mufasa, along with a few lines of dialogue that do not exist in the final film. I remember very little else of the film on the big screen, but I definitely remember that scene. So years go by, I think I'm out of my mind. College hits! One of my friends is in theatre with me, but is actually an animation major, and while slightly more toasted than I'd like to admit at a cast party, I described to her the "phantom scene" from the movie. She got super-excited. Turns out, that scene *did* exist--the cool thing happening that week in my podunk little theatre was a test screening! The death scene as I remember it can be viewed in rough animation almost in its entirety on the *Lion King* DVD, and she'd actually gotten to study it in one of her classes. It was removed from the final film precisely because it was so graphic--a lot of kids reacted negatively to it, so we got the version with Mufasa falling into a dust cloud, instead. What if we all shared our professions and/or passionate hobbies so we can sift actual Mandelas from "believe it or not, that thing *actually existed* for like two weeks in New Hampshire" experiences? So often odd things get dismissed right away as "you must have been dreaming" that when we find this sub, we assume "oh! All of those you-must-have-been-dreaming moments must really have been Mandelas!" and no, that's not necessarily true.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When did Czechoslovakia break up?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-05 22:32:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Someone posted about "completely different countries" and how nobody ever seems to have them in their Mandela effects. WELCOME TO SYNCHROSITY, I HAVE ONE FOR YOU. Okay. So my first day of college was in August, 2006. I took a class called Cultural Geography, which sounds way more interesting than it actually was. (I assumed it'd be stuff like "how different geographic regions have influenced clothing, myths, art, etc." when I signed up. It was actually stuff like "here's how birth and death rates work in Africa.") On the very first day of class, we were told to do away with the idea that we would be discussing "countries," because countries can and do change all the time. The professor told us--I remember this very distinctly, the kid to my left was a Rubik's cube world champion and was fidgeting with a 5x5 and the woman to my right was an adult student, I could close my eyes and draw you a diagram of this classroom--that we tend to think of country borders as being permanent and immutable because we see them on maps, maps are paper, and in our cultural consciousness paper is associated with impermanence. But--and at this point he pointed to the map at the wall, which was fucking *giant,* I'm 5'6" and this thing dwarfed me--"maps are not permanent. In fact, that piece of paper became outdated today." He then told us about Czechoslovakia, which had been trying "for more than a decade" to split, and that it had just signed an accord becoming Slovakia and the Czech Republic. So I cracked a joke elsewhere on this sub about the map changing in 2006, and someone commented that it happened in 1993. I was sure they were talking about the final formal dissolution of the Soviet Union, and responded in kind, but then looked it up just for shits and giggles and *they were right.* In 1993, I was in kindergarten and still learning how to write lowercase. The concept that I took detailed notes on complicated world politics in 1993 is *ridiculous.* This is not some random comment I remember some teacher making at some point. It was my very first day of college, third class of the day (the other two were math and English 101, very unlikely places for a discussion like this to take place). I could describe the teacher well enough for someone to draw. This being the first day of both the class and my college career, I took copious, even excessive, notes. The memory is very clear. So yes, I *do* in fact have a memory of a completely different country that should not have existed when it did. When did Slovakia/Czech Republic break up for you?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is anybody here ACTUALLY interested in what's going on, or just in feeling special?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-20 00:55:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I first found this sub, it was because I'd found the list of common Mandelas on Fiona Broome's site and was stunned by two that I shared: the "death" of Fidel Castro, and the cause of Jim Henson's death. Both were things I was quite familiar with--Castro because I was taking a current-events class at the time and had to read the newswire daily, Henson because most of my college friends were animators and I picked up quite a bit of knowledge from helping them with their final projects and sneaking into their special guest lectures. I was excited. This was some weird shit, and I wanted to know more. Then I found this sub, and in the last couple of months it's devolved into "omg, I'm a bad speller, so I'm *totally* from another dimension!" I've had people here insist to me that the Earth is flat and that they know it's flat because the bible says so and NASA are a bunch of liars; that things completely contrary to the laws of physics are the source of Mandelas; and perhaps the rock-bottom point, recently someone suggested a song lyric Mandela that makes *absolutely no sense* in context, and when I pointed this out they went "but I remember that way" and continued saying "but I remember it that way" in spite of all evidence being that their memory was wrong. Certainly it appears that something odd is going on, but explaining away every single memory inconsistency as "omg, I switched universes! Science is a lie and Thomas Edison is a witch!" is getting old. I'm starting to think this sub is full of people more interested in feeling special and wearing tinfoil hats than actually exploring the science behind something so widespread.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] Aqours "tribute" set? What would you want to see?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-24 21:55:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>So if you haven't followed the Aqours story yet, here's the skinny: the girls of Aqours, like the girls of  #956;'s, go to a school that's on the verge of being shut down. Chika is a fan of  #956;'s, and hatches a plan: save her school the same way Honoka and her friends saved theirs. Okay, now that you're up to speed if you weren't before: I'd really love to see a card set where Aqours pays tribute to  #956;'s--not an exact copy of an old  #956;'s costume, but one where you can tell they're basically saying "thank you,  #956;'s, for inspiring us and showing us how we can save our community." If such a set were to exist, which  #956;'s outfits would you want Aqours to pay tribute to? What modifications would you want to see to show they're paying tribute, not being copycats? How would you set up the idolized/unidolized cards? Who would you make the UR pair?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Discussion] For players on JP/EN: if you could blend your accounts, would you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-04 08:46:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>With the discussion of the upcoming KR blending with EN, I had this thought: surely KLab knows plenty of EN players are on the JP server, as well. What if, with the accelerated "let's catch them up" stuff we have going on, "blend your EN/JP account" was part of EN 4.0? Here's how I envision it working to prevent abuse: 1) You can only blend one account on each server. So you can't just reroll 4000 times to get an all-UR team for free--you have ONE JP account you can merge into your EN account, and then the ability goes away forever. 2) Some kind of "must be this rank to blend" cutoff. (100 seems reasonable, especially with halved LP.) This would do the same thing--prevent rerolls for that "perfect roll" and then blending in that account. You'd have to *actually play* on both servers. 3) Any cards not yet released on EN would be "locked" after you blend. So for example, right now I've got three of the recent Dancer cards on JP. If I were to blend my accounts today, right now, those three cards would be in a separate album on EN with little padlocks on them, and when they became available in EN scouting, I could unlock them and put them in the main album (perhaps for a nominal fee, like one love gem each or something). 4) Loveca would transfer over provided you were playing on the same OS for both accounts, but you wouldn't get, like, 892074239 LP to do a mega-rank-up. If your JP account was of a higher rank than your EN account you'd "catch up" after playing a song, but you wouldn't go from Rank 101 to Rank 200 from all the LP you got on JP. 5) "Blending" means just that--two accounts become one. There's no "oooh, I'll do this because I happen to have the same UR on both accounts and then I'll have one idolized and one not," it's "I've blended so now I can idolize that UR, but my JP account functionally no longer exists." In theory you could then start fresh on JP if you wanted to, but you wouldn't have a "mirror" of the old account. Would you do it? I frankly would, because with the catchup coming and the influx of KR players it's going to be nearly impossible to tier on both servers for me, and soon we're going to have the play-to-idolize/tier-to-idolize events. If you like the idea but not how I laid it out, how would you do it? Thoughts? Questions? Comments? Concerns?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reverse observation: What's the name of Taco Bell's exclusive lime-flavored Mountain Dew?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-15 11:14:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Quick! Don't look on Google, don't read the rest of this post until you answer the title question in the comments. Got it? Yes? Gonna add another line of filler here so you can scroll. Okay, let's go. I have ALWAYS known this drink as Baja Blast, ever since it was released when I was in high school. And all the equipment at my job--from our soda fountain labels to our advertising--agrees with me. But a lot of my customers lately have been calling it Baja *Breeze,* and expressing confusion when I say "A Baja Blast?" Baja Breeze would almost make sense because the slogan is "A tropical storm of flavor," but let's be honest, how many of you knew it even had a slogan? Or would get "breeze" out of "tropical storm"? Or would expect a light, airy word like "Breeze" out of a place whose advertising is done all in giant ugly block capitals that yell stuff like YOU'RE THE BOSS and EAT LIKE A MAN? Part of me says "that is because customers are idiots," and there is a lot of truth to that. (Actual conversation I've had at work: "Y'all got a box of twelve tacos?" "Yep, the Taco Twelve-Pack!" "And how many tacos is in that?" THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME FOUR TIMES AND NONE OF THEM WERE JOKING.) But part of me also says that I've heard a multitude of names for the Baja Blast, and those misnames almost always get the "blast" part right. A partial list: Lime Blast, Mountain Blast, Mountain Dew Blast, Berry Blast (don't ask me, man, this genius turns up drunk a few times a week and always asks weird questions like "is your sour cream a dairy product"), Mountain Dew Lime, Blue Dew*, Blue Blast, are you starting to see a pattern here? People mostly drop the "Baja," keep the "Blast," and tack on whatever seems appropriate to them. And yet suddenly quite a lot of people are doing the opposite--keeping the "Baja" and dropping the "Blast." This has been a consistent pattern since I started working here, and suddenly it's reversed. In droves. What gives?? *I have never had a woman ask me for "the blue Mountain Dew" unless she was relaying instructions from a male family member. I'm inclined to think this is related to colorblindness, not Mandela, because the Freeze version is even more obviously green and yet the same guys who ask me for "blue Mountain Dew" will ask for "the blue Freeze."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Scars and other bodily changes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-09 07:21:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So by now, I'm pretty sure you guys know I'm a hardass. I believe in the Mandela Effect, but I'm not willing to attribute every last misremembered thing to shifting dimensions or whatever. But something really fucking weird happened to me tonight, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Okay, so let's start here. When my mom was 27, she had a mole removed from her right arm. It was about the size of a pencil eraser and black. This was an issue. Weirdly, although I was born when she was 29, I remember this happening. I was five or six years old and scared because my mom was having surgery, and the doc was one of those cool guys who was like "yeah, surgery's a scary word, but guess what, I can cover your mom's *whole surgery* with a bandaid." (This would've been the early 1990s, before microsurgery was a thing.) So. That's been said. A few years ago, I noticed a scar on my arm. One that looked like I'd had a couple stitches. Now I've had stitches twice in my life, once in my face for a dog bite and once on my knee after I briefly took flight on a bicycle. In fact, it's pretty rare I even get injuries on my arms even though I'm really clumsy. I have never had stitches in my arm. Just now I reached over to scratch my arm and felt a bump. I thought it was probably an ant bite or something, so I turned my shoulder to see what'd bitten me in case I needed to put triple-bac or something on it. And there is a dark raised mole about the size of a blunt pencil lead where the scar was, and no scar. I'm freaking out. I know my own body. The mole itself doesn't scare me (maybe it's benign, maybe it's cancer, either way I can have it removed so who really cares), but *what the fuck?* Where did the scar go? Why is my mother's mole on my arm? I just turned 28 a couple weeks ago, did I literally pick up a copy of my own younger mother's arm?? Has anything like this happened to anyone else? I'm freaking out a little here.</TEXT>

I don't mind if you do the same thing I planned to do, or if you decide to "graze" throughout the evening (I have plenty of loveca for it), I'm just really mad that someone else's lack of planning has led to this when I planned this event so carefully.

    <TITLE>But Vincent Price died when I was in high school?!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-25 21:42:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been a long time since I've been here, because when I was here last I was getting highly disillusioned with both ME and the number of people here who seemed to feel any "I don't remember that way" was a personal attack on their character. But last night I ran across something I can't explain away, and it's downright creeping me out. First, it's going to help if you know I'm young for a Vincent Price fan, but I am one. When I was five or six I remember watching one of his old black and white movies just to hear the "Halloween voice." (No idea which movie, the important part to me was the voice.) My "favorite movie of all time" is split equally between The Wizard of Oz and The Great Mouse Detective. I own the 25th anniversary edition of *Welcome to my Nightmare* specifically because there's an alternate take of a couple songs that includes narration by Price. He's been a huge inspiration to me professionally and I adore his work personally, is what I'm saying, and I very clearly remember the day he died. I was in tenth grade, and I was so upset I actually left school a period early, went home, put in the only Price movie I owned at the time, and sat on the couch crying. My mom got home and asked what on earth I was doing with an already-fragile VHS tape I'd had to unplug the DVD player to watch, rewinding it to listen to "The World's Greatest Criminal Mind" over and over and over, and when I told her she also started crying and sat down next to me. . . . . I was born in 1988. Last night I was looking to see if there was a 30th-anniversary DVD release of Mouse Detective because the last edition was so awful (do not remaster for the sake of remaster jesus wept why is this so hard to understand), and stumbled on a forum that said Price died in 1993, shortly after the re-release of the movie. I was sure it had to be a typo, and ran to Wikipedia. It's not. According to Wikipedia, Vincent Price died shortly before I started kindergarten. *That is patently impossible.* I remember having a DVD player at the time of his death (it was one of those giant clunky early things that had to be all but dismantled to plug the VCR back in), I remember my English teacher asking if I was okay when he saw my face after sharing the news. Perhaps a more grounding event for people in my age group: I remember him dying after Fred Rogers, because it felt like all my childhood idols were vanishing along with my grandparents. I loved the man with the deep Halloween voice, and he was gone before I ever got to truly know the length and breadth of his genius but after I was old enough to appreciate the loss.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-12-06 08:55:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like in the coming month, lots of people are going to be going "wtf!" as they pay more attention than ever to songs that, although they think they know them well, have really only ever been background for most of us. Add to that the number of new recordings of old songs and regional variants, and we're going to have 752987230492 threads of people going "but the lyrics said--!" and twenty other people going "yeah, but there's a second version. It's been recorded both ways. And more ways than that." I don't say this to knock the people who genuinely don't know about stuff like uncommon verses or regional variants, it's just that in two days I've already seen three Christmas threads and the answer to *all three* was "it's a regional variation you're not familiar with." I mean, if you discover that a certain popular song I really hate now says "last Christmas I gave you my lungs, the very next day I took a big plunge," yeah, that is a Mandela effect. But if what you've got is "to save me from/some tears," I'm pretty sure both have been recorded. Is this a thing we can do? At least until the spendstravaganza season is over?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>UPDATE: The Great Big Yu-Gi-Oh Project, And My Nephew Bubbie</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-06 23:44:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! If you remember me at all, it'll be very dimly. I pop in from time to time to see what's going on with YGOPRO, but I'm more anime than card game, and I've only ever posted here once. A few months ago, I posted about my [Great Big Yu-Gi-Oh Project](https://prismatic-bell.tumblr.com/post/143451036171/its-time-to-d-d-d-do-something-awesome) for my mentally-handicapped nephew, Bubbie, asking if folks from Reddit would like to join in. AND BOY DID YOU. I finally got to see Bubbie in person a couple of weeks ago, and brought back pictures! Here are some updates: 1) My sister still has an entire dresser drawer full of special cards that Bubbie can look at, but not play with. I'm not sure what comes from Reddit and what comes from Tumblr, but these include a Gold Set (Legendary Set? I can't remember the name, sorry, it's a gold box with five decks in it), a couple of creative projects people built out of cards (one person made a story using cards slotted so the titles were visible, talking about being strong and true to yourself), a random card signed by LittleKuriboh that I honestly suspect was somebody's impromptu con treasure because it's literally an XYZ card or something he has no connection to, the pack of cards you could buy at DSoD in Japan, and like . . . a solid wall about as long as my arm of just cards, cards, cards that may or may not be "special" but that she simply has not been able to get to yet. Even though he can't use them in "decks" to "duel," he loves them. 2) She still has all your envelopes. ALL OF THEM. There is literally a US Mail sorting bin under her desk full of envelopes. If you sent a box, she cut the address off and saved it. She has five kids and a full-time job, but she still means to send each and every one of you a thank-you card. (I meant to get photos of the envelopes. I didn't have the chance, I was only there for two days.) 3) While I was there, I had the chance to give Bubbie something I paid crazy con prices for and don't regret it a bit: a voice recording from Eric Stuart as Kaiba, inviting him to duel as partners. It cost me $30 and I'd pay twice that twice over for what it caused: my sister and my mother both agreed that Bubbie's response to it was more than he's said all at one time without prompting since before his surgery. Immediately after hearing it, he just had to go through all the cards you guys sent him, hunting for BEWDs so he could help Kaiba. He laughed, he kind of danced a little, he was so excited, it was amazing. 4) Bubbie is normally very possessive of his cards. When my sister said "Nina wants to look at them. Remember all your mail? Nina's friends sent you that," he got this *huge* smile and pulled out these giant file containers for me to see. His short- and long-term memory are both permanently damaged, but six months later he still remembers the amazing thing you guys did for him. 5) While sorting his cards with him, I found one, way more Dark Magician art variants than I ever knew existed, and two, an ultra-rare holographic that apparently my sister missed while going through a few thousand cards. (Understandable. You guys will see why shortly.) I quietly sleeved it and suggested to my sister that it go in one of the "special rares" binders, and she put it away posthaste. I feel like that one had to come from one of you guys, and I wanted to give my own heartfelt thank-you (it was here that I found out just how damned expensive some DMs can be), and promise that it is well-protected for him to look at without destroying. 6) About all those cards . . . . . . . I'm gonna have to charge my old phone and re-upload its photos to my computer, apparently, because my pictures of Bubbie aren't on here. But when I do, hoo, boy, do I have a picture for you guys. It's a pile of Yu-Gi-Oh commons and duplicates about as big around as a manhole cover and deep enough in the middle that when I sank my hand into it for measurement, it disappeared, and I've got big hands for a woman. What you came together to create for my nephew was so much bigger than the sum of its parts. Every now and again he's *still* getting a stray piece of mail, and it's still brightening his day every time. Thank you, all of you, so very much. EDIT: I forgot I mobile-posted these to Tumblr when I was actually in OKC! Here, have some photos, no praying to the old phone needed! [I told you, manhole-sized pile.](http://i.imgur.com/pCdDrhn.jpg) [My sister said she's pretty sure he also got a couple of cards in Chinese, but they're still in the dresser drawer.](http://i.imgur.com/UKXssRj.jpg) I also forgot to add, none of these photos include the binders that were sent to him. I know at least one came from here on Reddit. These have been sorted if they weren't already, and shelved in her home office where Bubbie can come look at them. If I recall correctly, there were a total of five. What amazes me more than anything is the number of people who didn't just send old, worn-out commons--although he would have been ecstatic to receive them. It's the number who sent him their treasures, their rares, key cards to decks (even knowing he can't really duel) and literal entire shoeboxes and duel boxes *full,* saying "I have no idea what's in there, I don't care if any of it is valuable, he can have it." One person from here in the US spent $26 *just on shipping.* Call me cheesy if you want, but I feel like what you guys did is the spirit of Yu-Gi-Oh all over.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Update] The story of Jacob and the ???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-12-10 04:40:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>As promised, I spoke tonight with Dov at temple. I didn't tell him why I actually wanted to know--I told him it was a difference in translation between the bible I grew up with and the English text in my Torah, and I wanted to know what it "should" be, from the Hebrew directly. Dov immediately agreed it should be an angel, but also seemed to feel the original Hebrew had some wiggle room (he did identify Jacob's opponent by the Hebrew word "melach" or "malach" or something like that, it was hard to tell for sure because his accent is so thick)--that it was actually deliberate that it was uncertain who, or what, Jacob was wrestling. He was downright indignant over the idea that it was just some dude referred to as a "man," however, and actually advised me to check my copy of the text against a different Torah. Unfortunately, I don't have one. However, I *can* say that the Torah I use is one that was recommended to me by my rabbi, and that it is the same study copy he uses. My rabbi has a resume about a mile long--if there were an error as significant as "a divine being is referred to as an ordinary person" in a copy of the Torah he used, *he would know it.* So yes, based on what Dov said, I would say this is certainly interesting, especially since I recall having an illustrated children's bible as a kid that explicitly said "angel."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got a Chanukkah station playing on Pandora while I clean tonight because, well, it's Chanukkah, I'm not going to sit here listening to Christmas music while my chanukkiah is lit. So anyway, you guys know "The Hanukkah Song" by Adam Sandler? Like possibly one of the only good things he ever did in his life? I'm familiar with a few different versions of it because he's done multiple recordings of it and also multiple "parts," but apparently the live one that appears on his album *What The Hell Happened To Me?* has Ralph Lauren in it, pronounced "lo-REN." The interesting thing is, although he plays fast and loose with some pronunciations to fit the beat, the name would fit the beat better if he pronounced it "LAU-ren." There's no reason for him to have pronounced it this way if he didn't genuinely believe it was pronounced with the accent on the second syllable.</TEXT>

I'm going to work in about 20 minutes, but when I get home (around 1am) I'll update this post with reports from other states. ARIZONA *McCain: Call his Washington office at (202) 224-2235. All other offices have full inboxes or disconnected lines. I tried all four. *Flake: ALL inboxes, including Washington, are full or disconnected. Email him at https://www.flake.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact-jeff to voice your opinion. TEXAS: Cornyn: I only tested the SE Texas number, 713-572-3337. It worked fine, but I had to call three times to get it to go through--seems like the line might be going down. If this isn't your part of Texas or your part has ceased to work, you can get an alternative number here: https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/contact</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[rant/vent] Told my Nmom I had a shitty day at work. Her response was ridiculous.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-08 07:17:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I said I didn't want to talk about it, that I wanted to write and just forget my job exists for a few hours. She responded by CALLING ME (I should note: I have autism, going nonverbal is a huge coping mechanism for me), demanding I talk to her until I screamed at her, then telling me her day was really hard and that she couldn't "take it" if I was yelling at her. She also demanded I stay on the phone "just for three minutes" because she was driving drunk and wanted to talk to me so she could focus. I refused, telling her I'd had to put a friend on hold on Skype so I could answer her call. Her response: "Fine. All I asked was three minutes. But you're getting mad at me so I guess I'm not worth it." She came home, stamped around until she was sure I was too rattled to write, insulted me for not letting out the dog (because I assumed she was in bed and that he'd recently been out! Don't fucking call me stupid for making a logical assumption!!!), and then went to bed. Now my night is shot and I'm heartbroken and maybe this is extremely selfish of me but I really need someone who isn't railroading me with "solutions" for my job to just say "I'm sorry your day sucked. I hope tomorrow will be better" and I have nowhere else to ask for that at this hour.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there such a thing as "cycles" in narcissism, like cycles in bipolar disorder?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-10 07:47:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Or can it be made worse by comorbid bipolar? Because I'm starting to feel genuinely crazy. Like, okay. Sometimes my mom can be the most stereotypical N on the planet. Manipulative, "why do you do this to me," poor-little-Nmom, gaslighting, etc. (Tonight it was whimpering "I don't want to be on this earth anymore" after I told her that I felt like she didn't believe I had a right to my own opinion, or any knowledge of how I want to live my own life, because she keeps FORCING me to listen while she talks about how I should become a phlebotomist even after I say no multiple times and get angry.) But then other times . . . other times . . . . Like, Chanukkah, okay. I'm converting to Judaism. This was my first Chanukkah as a Jew (in prospective). In the Western world, Chanukkah has sort of evolved into "Jewish Christmas" even though that is 100% not what it's actually about, so she asks what I want for Chanukkah and I'm like "um, well . . . I dunno. I already got a chanukkiyah." And she goes "yeah, I was going to get you one but I thought you might be upset and feel like I was upstaging you because I saw you already got one, so I'm kind of out of ideas. What do you need?" I didn't have a blessed clue. So she spends the holiday in Houston with my sister (also converted, many years ago) and on the second day of Chanukkah she calls me in a panic: "it's supposed to rain really badly there and I sent you something for Chanukkah and I don't want it to get wet!" Moves heaven and earth to get hold of the Amazon delivery guy to be sure my package will be safe. I get home from work, light the chanukkiyah, open the package, and it's the most beautiful mezuzah, straight from Jerusalem. My mom is not well-off and mezuzot are not cheap. That wasn't a gift from an N. That was a gift straight from the heart, a gift of both monetary value and spiritual earnestness. I don't think a hardcore N, put in my mom's position, would have been even *capable* of coming up with "I know, I know barely anything about Judaism but I know mezuzot are important and she doesn't have one yet, so I'll get her one. Let me research it and buy one from Israel so I can be guaranteed it's kosher for her." That's just . . . that is a lot of levels of thought for someone who isn't yourself. And no, it didn't come from my sister--she said she did a little bit of checking about the mezuzah Mom picked because Mom was *militant* in her insistence that my first mezuzah should be kosher and she knows enough to know she doesn't know enough without the help of a Jew, but my mom both came up with the idea and selected the mezuzah. And my sister doesn't sugarcoat things. I'm the auntie who will occasionally be "grandma" by purchasing birthday and Chanukkah gifts and signing them "from Gramma" so the girls won't know (although the older one's gotten smart enough that her last birthday I got a phone call thanking me for the gift "from Gramma" and saying she knew it was from me because Gramma still thinks her birthday is in August, not May. I put her on hold to cry for a minute, told her I hoped she had a really really *good* birthday, and begged her not to tell her baby sister. She said she wouldn't. My nieces are so good, you guys). But my sister? Nah. She gave up on Mom years ago, and maybe she's smarter for it. If she'd picked out that mezuzah herself, she would have said so, and told me it was because she wanted me to have one. I know my big sis. Can you be, like . . . N only *part* of the time? Is that a thing? Because she's like the little girl with the curl. When she's good, she's very, *very* good. And when she's bad? She's HORRID.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-02-11 22:50:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>What it says on the tin. I called my sister and apparently this behavior is not new. Mom's been threatening suicide a couple of times already, this is just the first time she's done it to me. Her thought processes have been jumping from place to place so fast I can't keep up (and I have ADHD! I usually follow her better than anyone else), and when I get frustrated that I have no idea what she's talking about, she gets furious. She's untreated bipolar, but this swing is so bad it's approaching psychosis and bringing out all her FLEAS with it. This isn't a post about her, though. Not really. It's a post about me. I've spent so much of my life gauging her moods, her needs, her lapses, that now that I'm trying to break away a little at a time and realizing how badly-off she is and that I deserve better than to go down with her, I have no idea how to pull myself out of that. The obvious solution is to remove myself from the situation entirely, but that can't happen for a couple of months yet. Does anybody here who's still at home/not yet NC have any advice?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>This is NOT the street I turned down.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-12 09:49:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>(because this explanation gives pretty explicit directions to my house, all street names have been changed.) So first, you should know I live in a major city that actually has some small amount of planning. As a result, our major streets are all one mile apart, both north/south and east/west. The east/west streets are numbered. The streets going north/south have a few different name schemes going on, but they're still in squares and all a mile apart. Pretty convenient, really. So I work on 107th Ave and Jones, and live a block off 75th Ave and Smith. Smith and Jones are two major streets consecutively. There's a small street in the middle between them we'll call Cellar Street that has a stoplight, but it's not a "major" street by our definitions. Tonight I leave work--keep in mind I was only doing a three-hour shift, it's not like I'm exhausted here--and drive down Jones toward 75th. I stop at McDs, eat in their parking lot, and head to the light at 75th and Jones. From here, to get home I drive a mile north (left) down 75th, go through the light, turn right on Reed and my house is at the end of the block. No problem. Very straightforward. So I turn left onto 75th, and this is where it gets weird. I SWEAR I went through the light on Smith and turned right. I swear I did. I listen to Broadway in the car. These are not short songs, and the song playing when I turned left was not the same song playing when I turned right. I went through the light on Cellar, I went through the light on Smith . . . . . . . . and ended up on Antipasta Drive. Now, I've heard of Antipasta Drive before. Although that name is fake, the real name is just as weird--it's one you remember if you see it written down on a form. I look up at the street sign and I'm on 74th Ln and Antipasta Dr. So I wonder if perhaps I blinked at exactly the wrong time and drove a block past Reed, and . . . . try to retrace my steps only to get lost in suburbia hell. And by "lost" I mean "I didn't actually go that far, but it seemed like everything dead-ended in weird places and nothing connected." When I finally find 75th again I shoot out onto it not quite in a panic, but certainly in a great deal of relief. I turn right, which is what the presence of a 74th anything tells me I should do since 74th should be to the east of 75th . . . . . . . . and end up back at Jones, having never crossed Cellar. According to where I came out, I drove about two blocks up 75th and turned left. That's nowhere NEAR home. I don't know how long I was in that subdivision. My car clock said 11:26 when I went in and 11:13 when I came out. I can tell you I went in with not quite three quarters of a tank of gas, just barely a hair below the 3/4 line, and came out sitting on half, even though I don't think I drove far enough to actually justify using that much gas. TL;dr, in my memory I drove a mile and turned right, but reality is trying to convince me I drove two blocks and turned left. What. The. HELL.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dear Mom, It's 2:20am and I should really be getting to bed because I have to be back to work at 10, but my head is full and so is my heart. I blocked your number today. I never thought it'd get to this point. The point where I had to actively force you to stop making contact. I thought low-contact, low-engagement would be enough; sometimes I'd get to see my family and be able to deal with the little criticisms and bullshit for a few hours, and it'd be enough to make me feel like I had roots to belong to. God knows we have little enough, and you and Cartoon Villain Aunt seem hellbent on tearing each other apart. But I blocked your number. And I don't know when I'll unblock it. And that makes me feel so many things: sad. Hurt. Angry. Things I was never allowed to feel in your house. It has been sixteen days since I moved out and it still feels like it was yesterday. In much the way that I imagine a cut to the bone feels like it happened yesterday a few weeks later. I'm sad that I will never have a mom. That what I have is someone who has left me unable to trust, to the point that it feels safer writing this anonymously on an Internet forum than it does writing it in a diary. I haven't kept a written one since I was fifteen and you were "curious" what I was "always scribbling about" and tried to get me committed. Because that was easier than acknowledging how you made me feel, I guess. I'm hurt because you will never understand. Because you are so well-insulated in the idea that you are right, and I am wrong, that you literally accused me of having Munchausen by proxy disorder rather than accept that your words have power. I'm hurt because I turn 29 this week . . . . and I don't think you even remembered it's this Saturday. And I'm angry. I'm angry because I'm almost 30 years old and you still have the power to make me feel this way. Because I am so much more than you, and yet I feel you in everything I do--what would Mom say, would Mom like this dress, Mom would hate this band. I see you when I look in the mirror and I hate it. I have a pedophile for a father and a narcissist for a mother, and a kind and gentle stepfather you've tried to destroy. What kind of "family pride" am I supposed to take from that? Right now, at this precise moment, I feel like a giant cosmic mistake. No sane god could make a child like that exist. I'm angry because now that I'm almost completely out of your life I am realizing how completely, totally, thoroughly you poisoned mine. You told me once your favorite song was "Mother" by Pink Floyd, and I should have realized what a gigantic warning flag that was. Because it's true: I overshare constantly because I feel like I need approval, like I'm not allowed to have a personal life if you don't know about it. I'm squeamish about having a sex life because I know you will ask about it. When I was in high school I had a grand total of two friends and you did your damnedest to destroy both relationships (and one of them, you did). Eleven years later, you tell me you don't understand why I never had friends, and how much it hurts you. Bullshit. If it'd hurt you, you wouldn't have been making tampon jokes to a 15-year-old boy and asking if you could braid his hair. I'm sitting outside by a pool you will never see, writing this on a computer I bought with my own money earned at my own job and which you have threatened more than once to smash. I keep having to remind myself I don't have to look over my shoulder to see if you can tell I'm still up half an hour after getting home from work, because my roommates recognize that I am an adult and have an unusual work schedule and need cooldown time and all they ask is that I don't go banging a brass band past their doorway when I get in. I could go take a shower right now and not get screamed at for being selfish and running water after other people are in bed. I can even turn on lights in the house. Hell, I'm sitting here eating sunflower seeds! I stopped because you wouldn't have them in the house, even though I was always careful not to make a mess. You hated that sometimes there'd be a stray shell here or there and it wasn't worth the screaming. I blocked your number today, Mom. And I'm crying right now. I'm sure you'd be pleased; seeing how far you had to push to make me snap and either scream or cry seems to be a favorite hobby of yours when you're on a manic streak. I'm crying. I'm crying because I actually wanted to write this by hand, but I don't have any notebooks anymore. It never seemed safe. I didn't even like to draw in case you decided to take a flip through something. And I'm not so fast with my hands anymore as I used to be. I wonder a little, I wonder what else you've taken from me that I didn't even notice, a little bit at a time so as not to alarm me. You know, like how if you put a frog in boiling water it'll jump out but if you put a frog in cool water and slowly turn up the heat, by the time it notices anything is wrong it'll be cooked. How high did you turn the heat? How damaged am I? Will I ever write on paper again? Will I be able to use the art supplies socked away in my new room in my new house with my new roommates who know how to knock on doors? It's oddly comforting to sit next to a pool even when you don't have your feet in it, as long as you know it's there. The breeze helps. I blocked your number today. Because you can't respect my time when I'm at work or on a date; when I try to go to temple you make it clear you don't respect God's time, either, because every time I go with you, we're horribly late. Because my time is worth more than your can-you-just. My time is the equal of your time and I deserve to have that respected. I never quite figured out I had the right to a clean body and a dinner that wasn't in darkness, but I figured out that my time should be respected. I blocked your number today. And even now I'm not ready to say goodbye.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am a Taco Bell shift leader. AMA!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-16 10:52:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been working at a Taco Bell in the Southwest United States for two and a half years, and just celebrated my one-year as a shift lead (shift manager). I began as a Food Champion, moved to register, then cross-trained to all positions and became a Team Trainer. Following this, I started developing to move into management, and ran my first shift on my own last 4 July. Ask me your questions about the Bell, working there, or anything you'd like! I may decline to answer questions that require personal identifying information (like "what store do you work at") or would require me to break company policy (like "what's your next new item"), but if so, I'll explain why I'm not answering. **My Proof:** I didn't really know what to put here, so you guys get pictures. [This](http://imgur.com/j6OZfHB) is what it looks like when you fill out those surveys we're always begging for (yes, we see them. The blur in the bottom left corner is my store number). [This](http://imgur.com/G0nHHtX) is some cool shit I've earned by being really really good at getting those surveys. [This](http://i.imgur.com/8VFH8Ie.jpg) is a shirt from my pajama drawer that I used to wear, and the actual colorblind fashion disaster I wear to work every day now. (I wanted to use my Quesalupa shirt for the left-hand picture, but I just moved. The Quesalupa shirt is in a box. Somewhere. I think. I've given so many of my old shirts to new Team Members, I have no idea what logos I do and don't have anymore.) And [this](http://i.imgur.com/rVBSy8p.jpg) is what happened one night when we were in a speed competition with another store, our ice machine broke, and I literally vaulted the counter to get to the lobby and still make it under 60 seconds. I, uh, kinda came back across and knocked right into the tortilla shelf. (The shelf lived. So did I. But we needed new Doritos tacos.) EDIT: I have returned to answer more questions, along with my kitten, who is Helping. (read: chewing my fingers.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RBN online cookbook/found-family cookbook?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-20 08:18:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was thinking, one of the few things I DID leave Nmom's house with was a basic knowledge of how to get around a kitchen. (No small part of that is thanks to Alton Brown and Gordon Ramsay, but I digress.) A lot of people on the main RBN sub seem to have not had that opportunity. When you leave such a situation, you often don't have family recipes you can drag out for parties or home cooking, and it can be discouraging to try to do it all from stuff like America's Test Kitchen--because those *other* people, they have their shit together. They have a fancy kitchen they put on television that they make expensive, precise recipes in. You don't know pot roast from popcorn. They have garlic presses and six kinds of coffee machine. You have a beat up set of pans from Goodwill. They use words like "braise" and "umami." You use words like "Hamburger Helper." Their cookbooks are well-meant but ultimately impersonal and require a basic knowledge of how to get around a kitchen. Could we start an online cookbook of our own personal recipes that other RBN users can access to start developing their own cooking abilities? My family cooks a lot of Depression-era casseroles and such; if you have a one-cup measure, a set of spoons and one pot I can make you the finest dinner you've ever had. There are lots of delicious, simple recipes like this that are great starters to practice on while also not subsisting off ramen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't really have the spoons to even try to dissect it. It's easier to play an anti-anxiety game on my phone. Or browse Tumblr. Or think about how sick I feel right now and how I'm probably making it worse by crying. I realized that I'm crying in complete silence because to do otherwise growing up was to invite "something to cry about," and I tried to actually let myself cry out loud and I couldn't do it, and that's what broke me. I am miles away from her, living with roommates who, if they heard me crying at all at this hour, would probably knock on my door, ask if I'm okay, and offer me tea. There would be no shouting, no dragging me out of bed by my hair, no calling me a bitch or a pretentious lazy cunt, no telling me to shut up and go to sleep because I had school in the morning (or work, now, I guess). And I still can't do it and everything past tears is just numb. Just numb. See the thing is-- --my mom is sick. I don't mean mentally sick (although she's that too). I don't mean she has a cold. I mean she lost an eye in an emergency procedure this April with four days' warning between "we think we can fix it" and "it has to go," and her eyes are to her what my hearing is to me or what breasts are to some women who have to have a mastectomy and say they don't feel like women anymore. She's not faking a loss of sight. The eyeball itself is gone and may or may not be replaceable with a prosthetic because of problems in the healing phase. She's turned to drinking to dull this. Seven, eight, ten beers in a day, playing a numbers game where it's ultra-light so it's REALLY only three or four. And I want her to be well. I love her in spite of everything. If she were to truly be like "good g-d, I fucked up. Can you ever forgive me? How can I make it right?," yes, I would forgive. Yes, I would give her the chance to make it right, without hesitation. I don't want her to be missing an eye. I don't want her to be an alcoholic. I don't want her to be suicidal. I don't want her to be in this much pain. (Hey, I made a noise typing that, does it count?) I want her to be well. I don't hate her. I've tried to convince myself it would be EASIER if I hated her, but I don't think I have it in me to hate. Not that way. Hell, I sent a get-well card to my senator, who straight-up doesn't think I should have basic human rights, because he's recovering from a life-threatening illness. What is hate? I love her. And there was a space of about two years where she was lucid and kind and recognized how bad things had been when I was a child and wanted us to be better and we WERE better, she was TRYING and she was trying so hard and it was like a completely different woman stepped in to be my mom and I MISS her, I fucking miss who she was and who she wanted to be so badly then and who she was so close to being and I want my mom back, my real mom, the one I had for that year or two years and not this evil clone. I want her to be better. Physically. Mentally. I want to go out to lunch and swap tastes off each others' plates because both of us are looking at the other one's and going "ooh, I should've ordered that." I want to take her shopping and I know she hates it, but I want to go just long enough to find an outfit that makes her feel pretty again, real again, like she has a life worth living after this surgery, and then come home and watch some stupid shit on TV that we both like. There's not much of an overlap, but there is one. I want to go to a concert again the way we did in 2010 when it felt like she, and the world, were new. When we were so high off music and glitter and excitement that all we could do was scream at each other in incomplete sentences like "OH MY G-D WHEN HE CAME OUT FOR THAT ACOUSTIC SET--" "I KNOW RIGHT?" and drink our postconcert milkshakes and stay up swapping stories til 2am, both too hyped up to sleep. I want the woman I had during that time. Not perfect, but good. Healing. Better. Mostly happy. I want my mom.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-08-25 06:28:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>[see bottom if you're like "WTF." Otherwise just enjoy a chuckle.] You guys, I have a serious problem. I think my cat is a narcissist. See, every few days I have a bowl of ice cream, and whenever I do, even if he's in a deep sleep he'll jerk up as soon as he hears my spoon on the bowl. Then he'll climb in my lap and try to get my ice cream. If I lean away from him to get a bite, he'll climb up my chest and put his paws on my shoulders so he can sniff my chin, sometimes pushing me back on my bed in the process. If he succeeds, he'll lay across my chest and purr while my ice cream melts. I have to struggle for every bite, sometimes going as far as to stand up to eat my ice cream. I need him to understand this is not acceptable behavior for normal cats. Sure, everybody has a favorite book that might get laid on, or the occasional issue with hairballs, but trying this hard to keep me away from dairy is just not normal. [So the less funny side of this is, my mom used to do this with hot food. I'd sit down to eat and she'd say she needed a drink/a napkin/ketchup/the TV remote/a fork/salt and pepper, and keep coming up with items until my food was stone cold. If I expressed any sense of frustration that I couldn't get even a single bite of food between sitting down and having to get up again, she'd yell and throw things about and storm off to get her own whatever-it-was--and mysteriously not need anything else, although then I'd be subject to comments about laziness throughout dinner. Far less purring and scent-marking, too. But I was watching my cat tonight going "you know, if it was as simple as 'I just want it,' it'd be less frustrating somehow." Yes, I let him lick the bowl after, he's a kitten and he can still handle a few licks of dairy.]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First: Lasagn_? NOW I'LL EXPLAIN. I've always used "lasagna" for the Americanized version and "lasagne" for more authentic versions. I think I picked the usage up from a cookbook, but I don't remember anymore. (Irrelevant.) Point is, I've been doing this since college, so . . . six or seven years? I've seen both spellings used interchangeably by a LOT of people, in cookbooks, on TV, etc.--the "American vs Italian" usage is just kind of personal preference, if you feel me. . . . . except now apparently it's ONLY LASAGNA, as per my spellchecker. I mostly have spellcheck turned on to catch typos, because I'm a fast typist and I make them a lot. If I'd been getting that red wiggly line under lasagne for the last six years I WOULD HAVE NOTICED BY NOW. What. The. Hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Awhile ago, we talked about starting a weekly thread of easy recipes and cooking skills for people whose nparents barely taught them how to boil water. Let's begin! [If I'm the one running these threads, they're going to be running according to my workweeks, which run Wednesday to Tuesday instead of Sunday to Saturday, and will be posted sometime on Tuesdays.] This week: the humble Crockpot. Introduced in 1970, the Crockpot (more generically known as a "slow cooker") lets you make food over a period of many hours without actually being present. Over time, people discovered that not only could they use this ability to make reasonably tasty "normal" meals, they could also use its low-and-slow cooking method to produce things normal oven cooking couldn't, like fall-off-the-bone ribs and insanely tender pot roast. Although the Crockpot is often associated with soup--the easiest thing to cook in it--it can be used to cook literally hundreds of dishes. Brand-new Crockpots often even come with a little booklet of recipes for you to try. This thread will be active from 17 October to 23 October. Please post your favorite Crockpot recipes, and/or explain skills that might be required to make them. Generic internet stock pictures (e.g. "you will need a utility knife, which looks like this") are fine to post as long as the post isn't only a picture. If you wish to make a picture or video guide to preparing your meal, PLEASE SHOW ONLY THE FOOD AND, POSSIBLY, YOUR HANDS. In keeping with RBN policy, please do not post anything that would identify you or your place of residence. Instructions should be as precise as possible. For example, if I say that my favorite soup requires "three russet potatoes," that tells you *nothing.* You don't know what market I shop at, where my potatoes are sourced from, etc. But if I tell you that my favorite soup requires "two pounds of russet potatoes, or more until you like it," you can use the scale at YOUR market to find out how much "two pounds of russet potatoes" is where you shop. If you use nonstandard measurements (e.g. a pinch, a dash, a smidgen, a twist), and you can take pictures of what that measurement looks like next to a common object of reference like a coin, that'd be *rad.* Recipes should be shared in in this format: **You Need:** [All your ingredients should be listed here, including quantities] **Your Equipment Is:** [Anything you need to cook with, e.g. a paring knife, a stirring spoon, etc.] **Suggested Cooking Time:** [What it says on the tin.] [Instructions go here, in the order that things must be done. Remember that things that may be intuitive to you--such as turning on the Crockpot to heat broth before putting veggies into it--may not be intuitive to someone else.] Questions? Comments? Concerns? Please let me know. Let's share some awesome recipes and skills!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I feel like it was a horrible dream.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-19 04:05:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I moved out of my mom's house on 1 June. We are not NC, but I've been able to be in contact on my own terms. I have roommates who are wonderful, loving and supportive people. And: my mom has entered therapy for unrelated issues. (She was suicidal. Genuinely so, not the "you'll miss me when I'm gone" kind of bullshit.) So far she's been diagnosed with C-PTSD and anxiety, both of which sound pretty spot on to me. Here's the thing: between these diagnoses, and having been out of her house for four months, I keep finding myself doubting. Was it really that bad, or was I projecting? Did I imagine some or all of it, in spite of the people around me all agreeing something is VERY wrong with my mother and my sister's therapist actually straight-up saying that based on my sister's sessions it sounds like Mom has a cluster-B personality disorder of some kind (this is the group that includes narcissism)? Was I being too harsh on her? Was I expecting too much of someone who's genuinely physically ill and disabled? Especially because now, at some distance, our relationship feels almost normal--yeah, I still have to be like "mom I am hanging up NOW, I have to do X" to get her off the phone, and her thought processes honestly make no sense whatsoever to me sometimes, but like . . . . we can go for lunch. I'm housesitting for her right now while she's in another state having surgery. When I see other people talking about being stabbed or starved or stalked across the country, I wonder if I was making it all up for attention . . . even though the cues of everyone around me say no, I wasn't. Is it normal to feel like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of you might remember me coming earlier this year to inform the sub about the untimely loss of the poster Sarah, Rivkah Chaya bat Avraham v'Sarah. My sister is in Israel right now, and took with her a letter from me with Sarah's favorite picture of herself. Both were delivered yesterday to the Western Wall, and today she sent me a photograph of the place in the Wall where she left them. The likelihood I could find it just from the picture is slim, but when I finally travel to Israel myself I mean to try. Sarah is with G-d literally, and now in a metaphorical way. Blessings on her name and grief for her passing have been taken to the most sacred place of prayer and left for others to see and remember her name. May her memory be for a blessing.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I had to nip our pap's tail. Will it grow back?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-31 02:35:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So basically, our pap got into some very gnarly burrs in the backyard, like to the point that I couldn't find parts of his tail fur under them. I brushed him as best I could, but eventually I could actually feel the fur tearing as I tried--so I grabbed my sewing shears and nipped off about an inch and a half from the fur spray right at the end of his tail. According to my mother, this will never grow back. I can't imagine that the fur just wouldn't get longer again, even if it looks slightly different (he's not a show dog or breeder, just a pet, so it's not like that entirely matters), but now I'm concerned. Did I cut his tail for keeps without knowing?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Suggestion] "Hide" buttons?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-31 10:09:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I'm on like my eighth reset and basically just trying to accumulate Paragon at this point, and if it's possible--which I do not know because I have the coding skills of a stick of gum--I would like to make a game improvement suggestion? Custom hide buttons. Like, right now there are the tabs that sort things by type (all storage, all housing, etc.), and that's great. But there comes a point where, for example, I do not need any more libraries. I can far more efficiently increase my science via Bio Labs and compendiums. By that point, my screen is *jammed* with eighteen million buttons. I like to see how everything is playing together (e.g., do I need more storage for titanium, or are my titanium structures still small enough to hold off?), so just separating by type is not a good option, and doing it manually on paper would quickly get outdated and out of hand. Is it possible to have buttons where we can "hide" specific structures we don't need at the moment? Like the sell buttons, or like what happens when you click on resources on the bar on the far left, but to remove them from the main Bonfire tab. They could still be accessed from the specific-building-type tabs, or maybe just have an option to reset building visibility in the options.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Negative days?!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-16 09:09:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not sure if this is a bug or just something I've never seen because this is the furthest I've gotten in the game so far, or what. (This is my 13th reset, but I did a few rapid ones early on to build paragon for metaphysics.) Okay so, I was waiting on the last 13 seconds of science to build another . . . . Space Elevator, I think, might have been a Moon Base, doesn't matter. I'm just sitting there watching numbers. K? So then suddenly ALL of my resources drop to 0/sec. (For comparison, right now I've got minerals at 149.696K/sec. This was not just a sudden production difference.) Nothing is moving--not going forward, not going backward. I glance to the right--Winter, -4 days?! I watch it count down and then, as it hits Winter, Day 1 my production all goes back to normal. Was this a bug? I built my first two Chronospheres tonight, did that cause it? What happened???</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mom . . . . I need a mom to talk to about what's going on with you. I feel so helpless.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-30 09:59:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Mom, three years ago you were told you had a blood clot in your eye, and you'd need injections for the rest of your life to prevent loss of the eye. "It's okay," they said, "this is really rare in a woman your age, so it's probably related to this blood disorder you have. The odds of it getting significantly worse are almost nil. Just take your injections." And I was fine. It sucked, but I was fine. I could support you, and it didn't get too much in the way of your life. And then your eye started getting better! So dramatically better your doctor actually said it should be in textbooks! We called it a miracle. A year and a half ago they said "hmm, your eye decided to grow new blood vessels to get around this clot. That's not good. We'll need to increase injection frequency, but you'll be fine. At this point it'd only be a problem if you got a second clot, and you have better odds of winning the Powerball than of *that* happening." And I was worried, but I was fine. Your body was healing itself after a few-years-long bout with your eye, and complex pneumonia, and it was going to be okay. Eight months ago, you went to the eye doctor for pain so severe that you said it made giving birth feel like a zero on the pain chart. "We can fix it," they said. "You'll lose your sight on that side, but we can fix it. You'll still have an eye. We just have to inject alcohol into it. The odds of you losing your eye altogether are only about 20%, and it'll be at least a year before you have to worry about that." I was *very* worried. I cried and didn't tell you. I was about to move out, and wondered how you'd do with me gone. Ten days later I drove you to surgery to have your eye removed. You picked a fight on the way to the surgery center. You jumped out into traffic three times. You screamed at me and called me scum. Later you'd tell me you couldn't possibly have said that, until Aunt Louise said "I was there, and yes, you did say that." You apologized and said you were in so much pain you didn't know what you were saying. Which seemed legitimate, except that when you first screamed those horrible things at me, Aunt Louise told me not to take it personally because you were in so much pain and didn't know what you were saying and you screamed at her, too. I tried not to take it personally anyway, even though you'd made both of us cry. I slept through your surgery. I'd closed the store the night before, got to bed around 3am and got up again at 5:30 to drive you in. I was okay until they wheeled you out to the car with a giant pad of gauze where your eye used to be. And then I wasn't okay, but I pretended I was. You cried a lot. You drank too much. You took to smoking like a chimney. They put a special implant into your eye to help the socket retain its shape so you could get a prosthesis. I washed up like a surgeon every day, disassembled your eye, cleaned it, medicated it, and put it back together. You started calling me your special nurse. I wasn't okay, but I pretended it was because of other things. Tension at work. The suicide of a friend. Bills. You know, stuff that would be sucky all by itself, but add on a mother going through a mental breakdown and it's *really* sucky. You went to see the eye doctor. He said "the good news is, the odds are so far against this happening in both eyes, you'll need checkups for the rest of your life for safety's sake but you should be just fine." You went to a different state for cataract surgery on your remaining eye, and it was like a miracle. You said your sight improved to 20/15 and you could see colors you hadn't seen in years. You didn't know then that it was the last time you'd see your granddaughters, and neither did I. I want to scream in your doctor's face that he did this, he with his talk of odds and how fine you'd be. Every time he quoted you odds, you defied them in the worst way possible. I know it's not true, but you know how some people say that calling the Titanic "unsinkable" was like making a bet with G-d? That's how I feel about him and his talk of odds. He was betting with G-d and you suffered for it. I don't know when you'll lose this eye. But I know that in the space of a week you have become legally blind. I know that every time we speak, I have to listen to you talk about suicide and how you don't want to be here. I don't think it's occurred to you that less than six months ago one of my closest friends swallowed 700 pills and isn't here anymore for me to talk to. I know that my sister has said taking care of you isn't her responsibility, it's Daddy's. I know he won't pick up that responsibility because I've talked to him and all I hear is "I'll try," "I'm looking," "I was thinking," never "I'm doing." I know if I don't do it, there is nobody else. I am 29 years old. I have a rental with friends, a job, a small business, and a cat. It's a small life and not a wealthy one, but it's mine. And I am facing the possibility that I will have to rehome my cat, get a third job, and move back home at the age of 30 to take care of you because the man who should be doing it won't. I feel like I'm drowning, Mom. I go on vacation this week and I spent a large chunk of my evening crying, sobbing, thinking "enjoy next weekend, Nina, because it's going to be the only vacation you get for the rest of your life. You're going to spend the next 20 years being a bedside companion and when that's over you're going to be impoverished and disabled from the work you did to keep your charge alive." I'm crying right now. And I'm not okay, Mom. I'm not okay. And I can't talk to you about this. When I try you just say you're sorry you're a bother. You make me feel guilty just for wanting to live and exist and have my own little life, with my cat and my crochet. In 30 years I've never had the chance to just--be me, be an adult, make my own choices. And I want nothing more than to run away, go anywhere, do anything, change my name, pretend the choice wouldn't haunt me for the rest of my life. I'm not suicidal, Mom, but I would honestly rather die than face the life that looks like it's ahead of me. And I'm not sure it even matters. Three jobs? No downtime, slowly losing my friends, stuck in a city and state I hate, unable to afford my own antidepressants? I'll be dead within a year. I don't think it's occurred to you, and that's good. I don't think anyone else cares, and that's bad. I'm not okay. I'm drowning. I'm breaking. I'm dying. I need a mom and you're the reason, through no fault of your own, and I don't know how much longer I can take it. We're a week into this nightmare and I just want to wake up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know I'm breaking format here a little, but: I posted here a few weeks ago about my (IRL) mom's ongoing sight issues and imminent blindness, and my reaction to it. The moms here reacted with not only support, but excellent advice. One of you said something that really resonated with me: "don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm." It was like a badly needed bucket of cold water to the face--I hadn't looked at the situation that way, but it's true. In the last few weeks I've gone on my vacation, spoken with my rabbi, gotten a plan together with my sister, and tackled the issue of my mother's care and safety in a world she can no longer see. My sister told me last night: "thank you so much, so much, for whatever you said to [my stepdad]. I knew if anyone could get to him it'd be you. Whatever you said made the difference." My dad has gotten a local truck route instead of his OTC route, and is looking for better-paid employ; my sister and I are now mostly on the same page regarding how to approach our other relatives; and I just feel way more at peace with the situation and ensuring my mom is safe without having to sacrifice my future. It's going to be a bumpy road, but it IS a road now instead of a cliff. Thank you for your support and words of wisdom, moms. I couldn't have done it without you.  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so. I'm working on a fanfiction and introducing a pair of original supporting characters who are Jewish. My friends know I'm a big fat Jew who insists on injecting Jewish characters into every fandom she visits, but this particular fic has gotten kind of popular, and I KNOW not all of the people reading it will know that about me. The characters in question are a husband and wife loosely based on my in-laws (who are great people with lots of character). In story I plan to show Jewishness through things like a well-placed "Happy New Year" in the middle of October and talk about kosher, but--simply because such things will straight-up go over people's heads, I've been in fandom for 25 years, I should know--I want to give them names that you wouldn't often hear, if ever, outside the Jewish community. The wife, for sure, is Miriam, but I'm struggling with the husband. I've used Chaim for a character in a different story and I don't want to use Schlomo for family reasons. What are some other good, strong Hebrew names that would immediately make you think at least "yes, this man is definitely from a Jewish family"?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-07 08:08:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so, I'm buying in the US, $600 or less, and I've been using Acer Aspires since 2006. I checked the Quick Picks bar, and was delighted to see the Aspire E5 listed as a gaming computer. My question is this: It's listed as good for gaming (which is rad, because my current Aspire is old as *frick* and will not run Steam), but I also need to be able to edit photos for a small business on Etsy. (I run GIMP for this purpose, which my current laptop can . . . kind of handle, but not well. I'm not sure if it's because it's five years old or because it was never meant for photo-editing.) Should the Aspire E5 be good for this in addition to its suggestion as a gaming computer? I can live without being able to game, but the Etsy thing is part of my livelihood. That one's vital. I don't want to drop an entire paycheck's worth of cash on a computer, get it all set up, and realize it won't do what I need it to do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Tiffany Effect: how many Bible Mandelas are related to this?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-13 08:13:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So to elaborate before anyone reads further--lest I start terrible arguments--this isn't me being a skeptic, per se. I've experienced Mandelas of my own. I just think a lot of the stuff that gets thrown around this sub is a result of lack of knowledge and overabundance of panic and/or paranoia. So this post, specifically, is "the answer may be none, the answer may be most, let's just consider and discuss." So there's a post going around Tumblr talking about "The Tiffany Effect." Apparently, the name "Tiffany" was a medieval form of Theophania. Although it mostly died out for several centuries until "Breakfast At Tiffany's" came out, it is in fact quite an old name--and I bet that's tripping you right out, because it sounds so 1950s teenybopper. The only reason it didn't trip me out is because I knew "Jennifer" began life as a dialect version of "Guinevere." But you don't want a character named Tiffany in 1450, right? Nobody would believe it. A few historians have added to that post, adding things like "Roman maps included travel times and were equivalent to an early form of Yelp" and "nipple rings were actually a big fashion in Victorian times." These are things you don't really learn unless specific time periods or areas of the world are your area of study, because frankly nobody is going to teach ten-year-olds about Victorian nipple rings and this is 2018, who needs to know how to read a map from the Roman Empire? I'm wondering, with the massive influx of stuff like "guys! The word matrix is in the Bible!," if perhaps a lot of this has to do with The Tiffany Effect. People who don't know the origins of these words, or that their meanings have changed over time ("matrix" actually began as a word referring to the uterus; nowadays, it's almost entirely used in reference to computer stuff), see the old meanings and wig out. Obviously this doesn't cover things like the lion/lamb thing, but I do wonder if it's responsible for some of the other "changes." How many people have actually read and memorized the whole Bible cover to cover?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Warning to sub members about possible triggering content</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-12 08:55:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>So every now and again, someone on Tumblr gets it into their head to make some ranty, often very inaccurate post about how "[insert mental disorder here] doesn't mean what you think it means, stop being an asshole!" These include but are not limited to "psychotic people are never a danger to others," "depression self-care means not actually doing any of your daily tasks and indulging permanently in feeling nothing," and now . . . . . . yep. They've hit narcissism. And there's a post going around right now to the effect of "narcissists aren't actually abusers, they're just sick, you're denying them resources for help when you say they're abusive." Keep in mind there are abuse survivors *and even recovering narcissists* all over the notes going "um, guys? Guys. This is bullshit. This is wrong. This is victim-blaming and gaslighting." But there are also people who have named this sub and suggested "bombing" it with a copy/paste of the post text. In the couple of weeks to come, please use caution on this sub when opening stuff from usernames you don't know. So far the post is under a thousand notes, and enough people seem to have been calling bullshit on it that I don't *think* it's going to spread to the point that we get inundated with ignorant Tumblrinas, but . . . be careful. The person who made the post is literally using N tactics to "explain" why Ns aren't abusive, and I can very easily see that being very triggering for some folks here. EDIT: I looked at the profile for the OP and it turns out *they* are an N (who's surprised?). I'll be contacting the mods momentarily to pass the specific post on to them so they can stop it as soon as it pops up here, because I have the really bad sinking feeling now that it's going to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently LC with my mother because of some shit she pulled over Grampa's funeral, up to and including telling family I wasn't going to bother coming because I didn't care enough (this, while fighting her for the actual funeral date/time!). She forgot to pick up his obit when we were home and I have to take her the copies she requested. I set things up so she thinks I'm actually doing a "from one location to the other" work run and can't stop, but it's not going to be pleasant regardless. Please wish me luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been NC for a week, and I #8217;m genuinely afraid I #8217;m going crazy. I keep seeing Nmom everywhere. Everywhere! And it #8217;s like #8212;it #8217;s not actually her stalking me, it #8217;ll be things like I see her and I blink and then realize it #8217;s a different woman with similar hair or the same purse, sometimes someone who bears almost no resemblance to her at all. Today coming into work I saw a woman with her cell phone in her hand and it actually registered to me as a white cane. Does this happen to anyone else? Does it ever go away? Do I need to call the local psych ward?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Not allowed to have my own religion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-04 01:29:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Still on the detox from going NC, but this has been bothering me immensely. I converted to Judaism last year, and ever since, Nmom has used her Jewish best friend to invalidate everything about my faith--even though I have explained, multiple times, that there are many kinds of Judaism, all with different rules. An example: during Pesach, you're not supposed to eat chametz, the "five grains." (Wheat, oats, barley, rye, and spelt.) In America, some people also choose not to eat kitniyot, which are foods that can resemble chametz (like legumes and rice). I follow this prohibition precisely because it restricts my diet so much--during the eight days of Pesach, every meal is one of thankfulness that I live in a country so rich that I don't have to go hungry. During this past Pesach I heard *every single day* about how I was making things unnecessarily difficult, because her friend is Orthodox but still eats kitniyot. (I'm Reform, and the prohibition against kitniyot isn't followed by everyone--it's a personal choice.) She's also done things like . . . . Yom Kippur is the most important day of the Jewish year. It means "Day of Atonement," and you're supposed to fast for 25 hours and spend the day in prayer. I take medication that has to be taken with food, and I have blood sugar problems (which she insists don't exist). The days leading up to my first Yom Kippur were full of anguish for me--how could I fast without putting myself in the hospital? I talked to my rabbi and a couple of the more strictly devout members of my temple, and found out it's perfectly okay for me to eat due to health reasons. So, I chose to restrict myself to only a couple of kinds of food that aren't particularly stand-out foods (like crackers and cheese instead of a fab plate of nachos), eat the minimum required for my health, and fast from electronics for 25 hours. (Given how much I use my phone and computer, this is pretty significant.) Her response was to tell me simultaneously that 1) I didn't need to eat 2) I should come to lunch with her instead of to temple to pray 3) her friend said Orthodoxy doesn't permit eating even for health (which is, one, a lie--it's right in Torah that you may not fast if it would endanger your life--and, two, even if it was true *I'm not Orthodox*). Recently she bullied me into asking my rabbi to renew her marriage vows. I told her I didn't know if he could do it because rabbis are only supposed to officiate over Jewish weddings. Now I would like to point out that the *laxest* requirements for conversion require that you live as a Jew--which means prayers, temple services, and in my case, keeping kosher--for a year and take a class of study before you can actually convert. I've been living as a Jew for about two and a half years. As I type this I'm looking at a library of reference books that covers most of a shelf. And in spite of all this she said "well, my friend said" and I'd finally *had it* and said "I'm the Jew. You're the gentile. I know more about Judaism than you." Her response: "yeah, like a whole thimbleful." I hung up on her and she called back to ask why I couldn't take a joke. This year she called me on Easter just to tearfully tell me she was so sad I couldn't join her for dinner (pork, beans with pork, chametz, chametz, chametz, and yams), and that she was *so* glad Easter was still important to me because of Pesach. *Easter wasn't even important to me before my conversion.* I agreed to let my dad bring me a plate of yams at work. After four hours they hadn't shown up and I texted because I was worried. She proceeded to blame everything on him because he made dinner, and he told me it was his fault and not to yell at her. I'm sorry, but my dinnertime came and went and now it's close time and you want to bring me food? Fuck off. Not a single conversation went by for awhile where she didn't say she didn't understand why she couldn't be a Jew because the only thing separating us was a belief in Jesus of Nazareth as Mosiach. It didn't matter how many times I said "because that belief is fundamentally incompatible with Judaism" or "No, there are a LOT of differences you're not acknowledging"--she definitely knew better than I did about how she's totally a Jew but with added Jesus. (Which is not a thing. Even people who claim it's a thing are basically just Christians wearing tallitot.) She'd keep pushing the point until I got angry, and then she'd accuse me of trying to stir animosity. Other stuff she's done: repeatedly pronouncing "Ashkenazi," as in "Ashkenazi Jews," as "ash-nazis"; deliberately trying to trick me into eating pork, then saying she "forgot"; calling me on Fridays when I'm at temple with "emergencies," only for me to leave prayer and call her only for her to say "it's okay, I took care of it"; constantly refers to my synagogue as "church" and my Torah as a "Bible"; calls Chanukkah "Jewish Christmas"; makes Islamophobic comments and, when I call her out on it, says "You're Jewish, aren't you supposed to hate them?" Here's the thing. My sister is also a convert (to yet another branch of Judaism--she's Conservative), and she's . . . neither of us are GCs, exactly, but she's way closer to one than I am. *Nmom doesn't do any of this shit to her,* and I've never seen any signs of antisemitism from her otherwise. She literally uses antisemitism only against me, and apparently only to piss me off/upset me. The worst thing? During one of her "I'm trying to be a human being" periods, she actually bought me an absolutely beautiful mezuzah, with my sister's help. (It's actually the one that still hangs on my door.) She researched it, made sure it was kosher, it's made of olive wood from Israel, perfectly within my aesthetic, and I know it was *not* cheap. She was all for my conversion right up until it started giving me the tools to question the way she treats me. I hate that I have put so much time, heart, and effort into my conversion and subsequent life as a Jew, and she does everything she can to invalidate it. Not even to make me Christian--just to make me feel like less of a Jew, or perhaps like my religion is less valid than others simply because it's mine. I survived a cult while growing up, and seeing the wonderful and supportive group I've fallen into be treated this way breaks my heart.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My roommate is doing an amazing thing for me and I don't know how to react</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-16 10:19:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so, let's start here: I've been NC for a little over a month. (Wow. That hurts. For lots of reasons.) To recap: this began when Nmom decided to lie about me, my aunt, my sister, and my Grampa, when he wasn't even in the ground yet, basically trying to make his funeral all about her. I went NC and haven't spoken with her since. I've seen my dad once, but unfortunately cutting her out basically means losing him, too. I lost three parents in one week. This week, I'd normally be getting a card from my Grampa. My thirtieth birthday is in six days. His cards tended to be a little early because I have a cousin with whom I almost share a birthdate and he could never remember which of us was the 13th and which was the 22nd, but he *never* missed it--even last year when he was sick he got someone to go out and buy a card for him to sign. This was a big deal, because Nmom actually makes a joke out of fucking up my birthday on purpose. I don't celebrate July 4th, so this is the first yearly milestone I've had without him, and also being NC with my parents. And that's where we're at. Now to the roommates. They're Jehovah's Witnesses, which means they don't celebrate birthdays at all. But after seeing the last eighteen months of my life--which have been so horrible there was actually a point where I considered turning the wrong way onto the freeway for a few seconds on the logic that if I was comatose I wouldn't have to go to work--they decided I deserved more than an "oh yeah you celebrate happy birthday" and . . . . I don't actually know *what* we're doing this weekend, I just know I was told to request off work and this is going to be a multiday thing. (Apparently neither stripping nor burlesque is involved and none of us are big alcohol fans so I assume it's not clubbing, either, but I have nothing else to go on except that my roommates are awesome and I trust them way more than most of my family.) I. Am apparently getting the first birthday party I've had since I turned ten and my sister threw me one. (That flopped horribly, through no fault of hers. I was just an extremely unpopular child and she couldn't magic some friends out of thin air for me.) One of my roommates runs an Etsy and is actually using it to *raise money for whatever we're doing.* She's in only slightly better financial shape than I am, but she still felt it was so important to say "you survived this year and we're having a weekend about you" that she found a way to *reshape her budget* to make this happen. What do you even say to that????? What kind of reaction is even appropriate for "we appreciate that you're still here, and for religious reasons this isn't something we make a habit of but this time it's important" when only a year ago your "nearest and dearest" were calling you "immature scum"? I have no idea where to start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The big 3-0 is in approximately 40 minutes, and yesterday Nmom broke soft NC to tell me she needed to talk to me about something important. I texted my dad, instead. He doesn #8217;t even know what she needs to talk to me about (I suspect I know #8212;it #8217;s my Grampa #8217;s life insurance policy), but he opens with  #8220;I don #8217;t know what #8217;s going on with you and your mother but you owe her an apology. She never lied. #8221; I owe HER an apology! When she told SO MANY lies about the funeral that my sister said she #8217;s not sure mom knows where the truth ends and the lies begin! So I shared my proofs with him that I know she was lying, and he told me mom wants to meet with me to give back my coin collection (which....I have my coin collection, wtf?) and my shirt (huh?)  #8220;if that #8217;s how it #8217;s going to be. #8221; So I finally issued the declaration. If she #8217;s going to continue lying, and refuses to issue a basic apology for turning my Grampa #8217;s funeral into a family war, I don #8217;t need her in my life. Period. Radio silence. Happy fucking birthday to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So for those who missed it, my roommate was deeply unhappy with the state of my life for the last 18 months and wanted to do something nice to celebrate my 30th birthday. So she literally RAN A FUNDRAISER to go all out. So two days ago, we went for the Super-Fancy Pedicure at my pedi place that I #8217;ve wanted to do for three years, but haven #8217;t been able to afford. And yesterday we had lunch/dinner and much gaming at Dave and Buster #8217;s, and today we #8217;ve just been vegging at a friend #8217;s house. I #8217;m still kind of overwhelmed, but in a way where I #8217;m still bowled over someone thought I was worth this. It #8217;s been SO MUCH fun, with only a minor attempt from Nmom to destroy the weekend (easily brushed off). There are good people out there who will love you for exactly who you are.

    <TITLE>Trying to get fit without being able to see a doctor--advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-27 05:40:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so, here's the thing. I'm a big-boned woman from a family that's big on both sides. I'm not worried about my weight (I'm somewhat above 200 pounds, but probably below 215--I'll get into the whys of that not being a priority in a moment), but I turned 30 last weekend and discovered about a month ago that I can no longer jog up a flight of stairs--in fact not even half a flight--without being winded. Screw the numbers--what am I doing to my heart and lungs to be in that shape at my age??? So I've started working out. Right now I'm using Dance Dance Revolution as a way to do timed aerobic workouts, because as embarrassing as this is . . . I literally can't make it through 15 minutes on Basic. (Or, well, I can *now,* but I couldn't ten days ago.) The pauses between songs let me catch my breath and get some water and grab a towel, because even that much leaves me drenched. I struggled mightily with an eating disorder through my teen years--(my so-called "ideal weight" is 135--in high school I was at 117 and still trying to lose more), and I'm making a conscious decision to focus on how I feel rather than the number on the scale because I do *not* want to end up back where I was 15 years ago, convinced I was too fat because my menses hadn't stopped yet. Thing is, how I feel right now is really not good, and more than once I've had the thought that I should really be doing this under a physician's supervision. Because of my financial situation, that isn't an option. What can I do to help myself get to a healthier place without landing myself in the hospital? My current plan is just to keep aiming for the point where I only have to take one breathing break during the 15 minutes, then up it to 20 minutes, and just keep going from there. Should that be enough to keep me safe? Given where I am physically right now, is 15 minutes even doing anything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I'm Nina.  #8203; I've been in ACA for about a month, attending one local meeting. I've also been slowly detaching from my parents for a little over a year; my stepdad is a wonderful guy but an enabler, and my mom is abusive and alcoholic. (I actually also have an occasional presence over on raisedbynarcissists because of my family situation.)  #8203; I cut off most contact, what RBN would call "very low contact/VLC," in June, after my grampa's death. Lately, my mom's been very strongly laying on the guilt trips and asking if I care at all about her health, she doesn't understand what she's done wrong, etc.  #8203; I haven't actually started working a program yet--my group is in the part of the Red Book that deals with the Twelve Traditions and how meetings are set up--but for me, myself, personally, I've been trying to work on my anger toward my mom for the crap she put me and my sister through, both together and separately. And when she contacted me via text with her passive-aggressive BS yesterday, I just . . . lost it. All the progress I've been trying to make, I said "screw it" to all of it and said "you want to know why I haven't been talking to you?" and I laid it *all* out--the lies, the cruel words, the lack of responsibility, the emotional abuse. And then blocked her number.  #8203; I feel terrible. I feel cruel. I feel like if she's going to make a foolish decision with regard to her own life, this is the kind of thing that will push her over the edge, and I'd be responsible. Never mind that I literally pointed out she is a 60-year-old woman who refuses to take responsibility for her own poor decisions, and that I'm done taking responsibility for them for her--it still feels like if something horrible happens, it'll be my fault.  #8203; One thing that did help me was talking to my sister. She received similar texts and showed them to her AA sponsor, whose response was: "Wow. The alcoholic attitude is so obvious. You're doing what you need to do to get healthy and take care of yourself, and she can't or won't, and she can't stand that you're getting better and she's standing still." Knowing what I know about AA and what it takes to become a sponsor, it was weirdly affirming to hear my sister relay that statement--no, it's not just me. No, I'm not just overreacting. No, I'm not imagining things. But it's still really hard to say "it's really over, isn't it." This relationship wasn't aborted, it was stillborn, and everything that came after was just playing dress-up with a corpse.  #8203; I just don't know what to do now. I feel so untethered and anxious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since I posted here last, I've been able to enter therapy! Better still, it's run through the local Jewish Family and Children Services, which means my therapist is also a Jew, and I don't have to pause to explain cultural things or lay down boundaries about how my religion explains or expects certain things to be done, because he already knows.  #8203; Thing is . . . . every time I go in, I end up having nightmares. And I know that's just my brain processing stuff, but today . . . today was *awful.*  #8203; I forgot I had an appointment and so stayed up WAY too late, and while I did go in, I did it on only 3 hours' sleep, so afterward I napped. During that nap I had this bizarre dream I, thankfully, don't remember most of, but near the end of it for some reason I was forced to be present when Nmom returned from some kind of trip. This dream was timeline-real (as in: this was mostly not abstract, in the dream I was aware of the schism that originally led me to go no-contact early and of how much time has passed since I did), but we were in the house I grew up and was originally assaulted in.  #8203; In the dream, I fell asleep while waiting for her, because I was intending to be like "you're home. Bye" since I couldn't get out of it, but instead woke up with her laying on top of me and kissing my face all over, like she was trying to smother me, and, of course, ignoring all demands that she let me sit up. I woke up and felt short of breath, like someone had actually been lying on my chest, and just . . . . ugh. I needed to tell someone, and you guys are my go-to.  #8203; Has anyone else experienced stuff like this? Dealing with this in the aftermath of NC/therapy?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What to do with a troublesome coin? Opinions from fellow Jews needed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-26 11:12:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Warning: I'm getting into some Holocaust stuff here. Okay, so, I'm a coin collector. One of the things in my possession is what I call "The pirate's chest"--a fun way for me, and my nieces and nephews, to study geography. You print out a world map on kraft paper (to look like a treasure map, you see), and then I have this giant tequila bottle with an old-timey label that's full of world coins. You pull out the coins, try to figure out where they're from via context clues rather than just looking up pictures on the Internet (although that is an option if all else fails), and then mark your "treasures" on your map. It's a lot of fun, and way more interesting (and memorable) than the tiresome lists they gave me for two weeks in high school. So a few years ago I was on a coin collecting forum, and said I was trying to find coins from every country in the world that currently uses coinage, in an attempt to create the "perfect treasure map" for my nieces. Someone on the forum who'd been collecting for 40+ years, and knew how much I love coins for their historical rather than monetary value, excitedly asked if he could send me a pound of common coins to use for this purpose. Of course I said yes! . . . and he, not knowing my family is Jewish (I was still a gentile at the time), and meaning only the best, included a Nazi one-pfennig in the package, saying that he wanted it to be in the hands of someone who would appreciate its historical value without fetishizing it for what it represents. Which is an admirable sentiment, to be sure. When he found out my family is almost entirely Jews, he was horrified--the awful sinking feeling in my gut when I opened that package and saw the iron eagle was *not* what he'd intended at all. Here's the thing. I still have it. I don't know what to do with it. I don't want to sell it and use the money to buy another coin, or trade it for one, because I feel like anything I received in exchange for it would be tainted--plus, I have no way of knowing in whose hands it would fall. I don't want to just toss it in the bin, because as atrocious as it is, yes, it *is* part of history, a part we must be reminded of so as to never repeat, and there's something that just feels . . . *weird* about throwing it in with my old mail and banana peels. But I have to get rid of it somehow. I don't want it. And my coin collection is really the only thing of value I own, and it's bequeathed to my nieces. Regardless whether that coin is worth three bucks, or three thousand--if something awful were to happen to me tomorrow, is that how I'd want them to remember me? Opening a box of things I'd curated so carefully, so lovingly, and finding a Nazi coin inside? (Survey says, hell no.) I thought of possibly donating it to a Holocaust museum, but I don't know if it would be wanted or simply seen as in poor taste (or even as a threat). Faced with this situation, what would you do? (Is this even perhaps something I should take to my rabbi to ask for his advice?)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mandela test: looking for information on a lost town</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-27 01:22:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so a small amount of background first. This is a thing that happened to my mom, and I posted about it to Tumblr. If you think this story sounds familiar "from somewhere on the internet," you're probably right--it went viral across social media, although I was never contacted by anything like Buzzfeed to confirm the story.  #8203; What I found weird--given that it was originally posted as a GITM--was the number of people in comments who went "wait, what do you mean it doesn't exist?! But I've been there, I could almost draw a map" or, alternately: "I've been there, and you're right, I saw it traveling one direction but not going back the exact same way." All of these commenters agree on the general makeup of the town. Everyone who's actually been there agrees it's somewhere in the southern half of Arizona, although opinions are split on *where* in southern Arizona. At this point two or three dozen people have agreed they've been there. We're talking about a tiny rural town, so finding that many on a single social media website seems quite significant to me.  #8203; POINT OF THIS POST: I am looking to confirm the existence of a town called Bare Feet, Arizona. We have actively ruled out the possibility of it being Bear Flat.  #8203; \[Description to follow. If you think you've heard of Bare Feet from somewhere that wasn't my original Tumblr post, please indicate so in the comments BEFORE reading the description, then come back to see if it matches in whole or in part. Trying to do this as scientifically as possible with a vanishing town, which means trying to avoid giving anyone false memories.\]  #8203; Bare Feet, as we've been able to piece together from these scattered accounts, consists of (but may not be limited to) a Native-owned truck stop, a diner, and a competing gas station. Only one person has mentioned any kind of visible domiciles (a few trailers). The most recent sighting was in 2015, and was of the "it was there, it WAS, my mom and I were both there but we just looked on a map and what the fuck" variety. The most recent travelers have indicated that the town--which is not a ghost town and still functions pretty much as any other tiny Arizona town--seems to be getting progressively more anachronistic; one person said that in the 2000s Bare Feet's gas station still had the kind of pumps where you had to wind them up before you could use them. No mention of anachronistic prices by anyone, but multiple people have stated that being there felt like "not being in the right time;" two younger people who contacted me about it and said they'd been there were surprised by the number of working payphones in Bare Feet. My mother reported it being somewhat south of Maryvale, Arizona, in 1973; another person placed it near the Arizona/New Mexico border, and several have stated they traveled through it between Phoenix and California.

Nobody has indicated finding it late at night.  #8203; I would be willing to write this off as a very elaborate glitch, or perhaps a place where two worlds occasionally get their wires crossed, except for the (comparatively) very large number of people who've been there. Bare Feet itself has under 100 people, so when three dozen say "I've been there" over the course of almost fifty years, and several of those three dozen had accompanying witnesses, the number of people who've been there is almost as large as its population.  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I need to vent/some advice on someone in my bat mitzvah class.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-17 11:22:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, we'll call this lady Rose. (Not her real name.) Now let it be stated, I'm becoming bat mitzvah at age 30 because I'm a convert, and for me this is a step toward being able to read all of Torah in its original language (which I find very exciting). Our class includes two converts, three elderly women who grew up Conservative or Orthodox and never had the chance to become bat mitzvah . . . and Rose.  #8203; Here's an incomplete list of stuff Rose has done during her time in our class:  #8203; \--complained that she was "turned off" being a Jew shortly after she turned 13, and hasn't been in a synagogue since. (I'm not quite sure how old she is, but late 50s at least.) \--complained that she had to be a temple member in order to take a temple class, because she doesn't like giving money to a synagogue. \--repeatedly refused to come to Friday night or Saturday morning services even at the insistence of our teacher, and instead keeps demanding that we cut class short one day so we can take her into the sanctuary to see the layout and run through how a service is supposed to go \--asked what the Shema was. After it was explained to her with great reverence by five of us, she turned to me about three minutes later and said "so the Shema is just some prayer?" \--asked why the synagogue would cancel religious school for Easter; when everyone stared at her and went " . . . because it's Pesach," she went on a rant about how we shouldn't be celebrating a holiday that has nothing to do with us, in spite of us repeatedly telling her we were celebrating an important Jewish holiday \--stated that she married a Christian on purpose so she could raise her children as gentiles \--stated that we should change the chant for her parashah because it's "hideous" and "not cute" and "ought to be modernized" even though I explained, multiple times, that the chant is a form of sanctifying Torah \--keeps calling the bimah a "stage" and referring to herself as "getting onstage" \--is upset that she's being asked to make aliyah for someone else's reading because she doesn't want to recite any of the prayers, saying it's "too hard" \--in the early parts of the class, kept complaining about having to learn the Alef Bet \--refused to do written practice until shamed into it by the rest of the class \--refuses to give a reason for becoming bat mitzvah, including refusing to write an interpretation of her parashah because it's from Bemidbar and "it's boring" \--refuses to read from Torah itself, saying it's too hard to learn without the vowels \--apparently plans to lay her photocopied study sheet on top of the Sefer Torah scroll?! \--is upset about having to wear a tallit on the bimah \--said she was "jealous" of my parashah because I'm sharing the Ten Commandments with a couple of the other women; when I pointed out that she was given the option to become bat mitzvah on Erev Shavuot with us, and refused, she sulked and went back to complaining that we "had it easy" \--stated she didn't want to learn the prayers, do a community service project, talk at all about what made her want to be bat mitzvah, or attend services because she works 40 hours a week and it's too hard. I should point out here that I work 60 hours a week at three separate jobs, *at night*, and find a way to get to class at 9am along with attending weekly services, baking for the oneg, planning my community service project, learning my parashah, *and battling depression,* and I've actually had less time with my parashah than she has. If you really want to do it, *you find a way.*  #8203; I feel like her shenaniganery is cheapening my own efforts. Am I wrong for feeling she shouldn't be allowed to become bat mitzvah and occasionally even questioning if she's actually Jewish? My roommate is a Jehovah's Witness, and when we were discussing this one day I asked her what her thought would be if she was at a Bible study with someone who kept talking about not believing in Jesus, making the sign of the cross, and complaining about having to learn to be conversant with large swathes of the Bible. Her response: "I'd be looking for the Molotovs and the lighter." This is exactly how I feel about Rose--I don't know what she's doing there, I'm not at all convinced it's benign, and I'm torn between anger (that her demands and tantrums are cutting into my own learning time; that she's not taking this seriously; that this is apparently an acceptable attitude in a bat mitzvah student) and fear (what on earth is she *doing* here???). I've talked to my rabbi and the head of the religious school, but while my rabbi is deeply concerned, neither of them have so much as spoken to her.  #8203; What should I do? Let it go and let her make a fool of herself and a mockery of the service? Keep pushing for the rabbi to speak with her? I'm at a loss, and I could really use some advice.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-19 07:41:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/u9JA8zp).  #8203; So, a little more background: I spotted this weird bubble all the way from Sanctuary and ran on up there. On arriving, I found this. The Vault door appears to be missing; there's just this weird yellow painted patch, recessed as though the door got stuck, where you'd normally see the words "stand back" and the metal that has the faded "VAULT 111" on it. The bubble is visible from both the inside and the outside of that area (as in, I could walk into it, and it was still visible). When I tried entering the Vault, I got stuck on a black loading screen.  #8203; Since I'm on PC, I decided to try porting out to QASmoke, and found a random automatron there. I've played around pretty extensively in the test rooms just for kicks and giggles, and NEVER seen an automatron there before. After determining I could in fact port to different places, I ported out to Sanctuary--but couldn't move. No walking, no jumping, no crouching. It was like I was still stuck on the nonexistent door into the Vault.  #8203; Reloading fixed the "no movement" problem, but the black bubble is still there and the door is still missing. I fast traveled to Taffington and then back to the Vault--still a bubble, still no door. As far as I know, I don't have any mods that should cause this--I first noticed the bubble a couple days ago, but my last mods download was before that (and had nothing to do with the Vault; I picked up the mod that lets you have orphans). In addition, the bubble has a refID--I tried clicking it and using the "disable" command, and not only did the bubble disappear, so did that weird yellow-textured thing--I was actually able to walk right up to the hole, as if the door had gone down, and to jump down--where I found, wait for it, *the door*. Correctly textured and everything. But still on the same cell--it never loaded me into the Vault. It's like the door is stuck halfway between the surface and the loading screen, although the fall looked like quite a long way (no damage, though).  #8203; I ported into the Vault via console commands--no problem getting in, but the elevator was missing, and no attempt to use the activation port from inside was working. I ported back to Sanctuary, slept--since in-game time was well after midnight and it was dark as hell--and then went back to the Vault. Bubble still gone, door and weird-textured-thing still missing, but it was now daylight enough that I could look down the shaft and see that it goes down far enough to run out of texture--you can see dirt at the bottom. EDIT: I decided to reload a save from before I disabled the bubble, then tried disabling/enabling it, wondering if that would make the door come back. No dice (although the bubble returned! So like . . .take that as you will.) I also tried disabling the Vault around it to see what's under there, and the answer is nothing. That yellow texture is a square when you take the rest of the Vault away, but there's no indication of anything else there at all.  #8203; SECOND EDIT: If anybody was wondering, the refID for the bubble is 000244ec \[EP\].</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A question about my bat mitzvah talk--could use some opinions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-24 09:40:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Preface: while Orthodox folks are welcome to chime in, I'm Reform (or perhaps Conservaform, as it were), so those answers might be more . . . . useful . . . . to my specific situation.  #8203;  #8203; So, my bat mitzvah reading is on Erev Shavuot. I'm sharing the ten commandments with a couple of other adult b'nei mitzvahs, and my specific two commandments are three and four, but I'm planning to speak about all ten (especially since at least two of the other women aren't planning on speaking).  #8203; Here comes the question. It's a weird one.  #8203; My take on the ten commandments is summed up in the thesis "the ten commandments aren't really about the ten commandments. They're a blueprint to follow that sums up all 613," in which the outline of that blueprint is "be kind," set in an ever-widening circle: be kind to G-d (commandments 1-3), be kind to yourself (commandment 4), be kind to your family (commandments 5 and 7), and finally, be kind to your community (commandments 6-10).  #8203; I really kind of want to open with a quote from Harry Potter: "someday, you will be asked to choose between what is right, and what is easy. On that day, remember." But then I wonder if a children's series about magic--even if it's just a particularly apt quote--is really an appropriate thing to quote from the bimah.  #8203; Your thoughts? Is the source of the quote a problem? Is it frowned on to even introduce another book, even though I'm using it as sort of an overarching everything to encapsulate my points about Torah?</TEXT>

I know this probably seems like an odd request, but--is there anyone here who'd be willing to stop at Giant Eagle and pick up a wildflower bouquet with one of those little free notecards, and take it to his gravesite? I can provide his name to locate the plot (it's pretty close to the front of the cemetery--right across from the Jewish section), I'll reimburse you for the flowers, and I'll pay $20 for your time and trouble--just send me a picture of the receipt so I have an exact total.  #8203;  #8203; If I can't be there myself, it's the next best thing I can do.

    <TEXT>Mom,  #8203; I haven't talked to my bio-mom for almost exactly a year. Today I got a phone call from my aunt, sobbing and begging me to call because my mom has MRSA in her one remaining eye and her legs are so swollen her feet are black. She's been a heavy drinker (teetering on the line of alcoholic) for a few years, a chain-smoker even longer than that, and abusing prescription drugs for more than a decade, and I suspect her kidneys may be shutting down.  #8203; My aunt begged me to call her. I promised I would, but said I wouldn't make any further promises--not seeing her, not visiting her, nothing. Those ties are more or less broken and I have little to no interest in mending them.

    <TITLE>I'm in some real dental trouble, and it's not cosmetic.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-08 22:28:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>WARNING: KIND OF GROSS PICTURE.  #8203; Okay, so. I have some pretty weird teeth because I had a lot of high fevers as a kid, and in the last few years I've had a couple of teeth just . . . hollow themselves out. No apparent cavities or anything (although I have plenty of those elsewhere, my teeth are crap in spite of regular brushing and my funds are low), they just go hollow.  #8203; A couple of weeks ago I noticed this weird swelling on my gum. But it didn't hurt, and this being December and me working in the service sector, I sort of went "I should get that looked at" and forgot all about it.  #8203; I woke up this morning and that swelling is very, very angry about being forgotten. It's doubled in size, it's centered right over one of those hollow teeth, it's *throbbing* and the gum around the tooth is bright red. I've had to do this before: it's an infection and the course of action will be "dental visit, 'we can't save this tooth,' antibiotics, another visit, pull it."  #8203; Even through the cheap dentist in my town that's going to be around $450: three hundred to pull the tooth (*I'm not joking it's fucking ridiculous*), $60 each for dental visits, and about twenty bucks for the antibiotics.  #8203; In the past, I've always been able to pull money from *somewhere* when one of my teeth decides to go rogue. But because it's year-end/year-start, my final 2019 paycheck was out-of-cycle and constituted one week's pay that has to last three weeks instead of my usual "two weeks' work for two weeks' pay". Once I paid phone and rent, that was all gone, and I don't get paid again til the 21st.  #8203; If some guardian angel wants to throw the whole $450 at me I certainly wouldn't say no, but right now my main concern is eighty dollars: enough to get in, get meds, and get this infection down. I'm running through PayPal because GoFundMe says it takes up to a week to get funds and I literally cannot wait a week (if the infection got that much bigger that fast, its next stop will be my sinuses), so I can be found at [technicolor\_nina@yahoo.com](mailto:technicolor_nina@yahoo.com), BUT . . .  #8203; If you want proof, here's a (gross, sorry) picture. You can see the hollow tooth third back, with the broken bottom. That weird gray/black quality isn't cavity--it's literally a lack of tooth innards. I had to get the camera too close to my mouth to do the traditional "paper with my reddit name on it" thing, but you can pop the image into Google search, nothing else will come up. https://preview.redd.it/05si4s7msm941.jpg?width=2016 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=cf7205569b8cdca0c4c7732e993c2d41ec75704e</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's really not, and it actively bothers me that there's no synagogue in FO4 (not even the ruins of one). So basically around the same time I said "screw you" to McDonough and decided to build A City Even Better Than Diamond City (tm), I decided I had to figure out how to build a synagogue.  #8203; Behold, Temple Beth Miflot (House of Refuge):  #8203; [https://imgur.com/a/44XHlGj](https://imgur.com/a/44XHlGj)  #8203; I can't move the curtains in front of the ark, which has no Torah in it because in all my mod packs there's not anything that even looks like a scroll (and so far I haven't even figured out how to access assets and stuff to make mods, in spite of poking at like three different programs--otherwise I'd have a Sefer Torah, menorah, Chanukkiyah, kippot, actual tallitot, challah, the works). But with the assistance of roughly six mods, I came up with makeshift ark, ark cover, eternal light, prayer books, tallitot (prayer shawls), bimah, and carpeting that mimics the colors in a kosher tallit. The plants in the corners would probably be fake in-universe, but palms, especially date palms, are deeply significant in Judaism, so the plants were chosen for that reason. I used benches instead of chairs because it meant fewer hitboxes to try and line up. And it's set up for egalitarian Reform-style seating instead of separated Orthodox-style seating because I'm Reform and I said so. And yes, if anybody's wondering, it's oriented correctly with the ark on the eastern wall.  #8203; I'm still looking for single candle stubs so I can make a menorah, and I'm considering downloading that "flags of the world" mod to add the Israeli flag because most synagogues have one, but given that there's basically zero assets in the original game that would allow for something like this, I'm pretty pleased.  #8203; (Mods used: HZY Furniture Pack, V's Stylish Decor, Just Some Rugs, Settlement Objects Expansion Pack, Functional Objects Overhaul, and of course, OCDecorator.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I decided to clear the Switchboard before heading to meet the Railroad for the first time, because I wanted to see if there was any special dialogue for it.  #8203; Most of the synths weren #8217;t there (I did run into a couple roaches and Radscorpions, though, including one that rather hilariously yeeted itself through the wall when I shot it and reappeared a couple floors below, waiting to be looted), and the turrets were all in two pieces, the tops sorta floating next to the bases. It felt genuinely abandoned #8212;like wow, these people died and nobody even bothered to move the bodies? What happened here?  #8203; It #8217;s probably the closest I #8217;ve gotten to what it would actually feel like to wake up in Vault 111 and step out into the real world. We #8217;re expecting it because we #8217;re players and so it #8217;s not such a shock, but for the character it has to be WILD.  #8203; EDIT: I died last night right at the end because I forgot those stupid cryo mines were there, so today is when I actually got all the way outside. You know the synths that normally appear in Slocum's Joe after the quest? Not present. Neither is the minefield outside.  #8203; Doylist explanation: The quest has to be activated to trigger the synths and mines. Watsonian explanation: The Institute has a much, much closer eye on you than you think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm currently doing Charlie's quest, and there's a line of dialogue from one of the triggermen: "every minute you hide, I just get madder." Pretty normal and repeatable, along the same lines as the stuff the raiders yell at you.  #8203; Thing is, in the second warehouse I got this line . . . and it sounded like it was spoken by a synth? I didn't exactly have time to grab my phone and start recording, but it wasn't at all like a usual triggerman voice.  #8203; There was no synth component on any of the triggermen in the warehouse, but is it possible to pull synth triggermen? Is that a thing? (Might that have *been* a thing that ceased to be a thing and they never dummied it out?)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An eerie thing I've discovered about the Glowing Sea . . .</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-02 11:11:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I decided to head in with my regular leaded armor, a bunch of Rad-X and RadAway, and nothing else, on Survival mode. (Okay, full disclosure, I DO have a mod that lets me make chems I can save my game with.) Mostly because I'm down at Somerville Place anyway and I'm curious to see what happens if you get to Virgil before you start the main questline, assuming I can ever get past all these motherfucking radscorpions.  #8203; Anyway: there's a specific rock you can stand on when you leave Somerville Place where, if the Glowing Sea isn't having a storm, you can look in one direction and see the roof of Somerville Place and look in the other direction and see the spire of Hopesmarch Pentecostal Church, which is the first location marker inside the Glowing Sea (at least, this particular part of it, I know there's an actual "edge of the Glowing Sea" marker elsewhere).  #8203; In real life, that'd put the two locations less than a mile apart, because the ground is so hilly and the air itself a little hazy even on a non-storm day.  #8203; There's something very eerie about that. A ten-minute walk and you're on ground zero. A nuclear bomb fell there and killed tens of thousands of people. Nobody inside that crater survived. Most probably had time to say "what's that sound?" as the bomb fell, and then they were dead. The lack of skeletons isn't the result of being eaten by later mutations--the bodies just vaporized, or possibly were burned to nothing as the ground melted and turned to volcanic glass. The impact of the bomb itself would have been amplified by car batteries, plutonium wells, all the other sources of radiation within that immediate radius. They would have melted down and created mini-explosions of their own.  #8203; And there's a pair of little kids growing up less than a mile from that.  #8203; They can literally climb the hill and see it while they're playing, if they want to.  #8203; Maybe it's just me. But the thought brought a little chill to my heart.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On my way back out of the Glowing Sea on my "main quest? What main quest?" excursion, I found the Sentinel Site . . .</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-04 08:01:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>. . . . I have to wonder. Google Maps tells me this whole area is currently wetland and woodland reserves with a few highways going through. The Sentinel site, plus a few random factories, are all that remain after the blast; was that whole area a small town designed for military needs?  #8203; Inside, there are very few skeletons, a whole lot of ghouls, a barracks . . . and a long-ago initiated launch sequence.  #8203; Is this why Boston was bombed? To prevent the Sentinel site from ever being used? They were doing experiments to load higher-yield bombs onto ICBMs; did they finally work?  #8203; Did the people living in here even know the War happened? The building was designed to be bomb-proof and radiation-proof because of its intended purpose; it would've functionally been a giant fallout shelter when the bombs hit. Did they feel the building shake? Did they know what it was? Did they cry? Did they pray? Did any of them care? As they hit the launch button, did they clap each other on the backs and say "good job"?  #8203; Did they know it was a suicide mission?  #8203; And how did they all become ghoulified? Did someone open the door to the outside to see what was going on, everyone else crowded around, concerned because of the sudden loss of communications? What happened to those skeletons, still in their lab coats; did they quickly become food for their suddenly-savage former coworkers? Did they all know, and realize all they could do was keep the doors shut, only to succumb to the Mark 28s on the levels below? Whatever happened had to have happened quickly, because there are multiple terminals but no entries explaining the building's fate.  #8203; What happened here, the day the world died?</TEXT>

I'm talking stuff like "hey, this adds cool textures" or "I deeply enjoy the clothing not looking like it was designed by a colorblind person" or "nifty, the trees don't have to all be dead."  #8203; My personal fave in this category is Delightful Ivy, which makes the vines in the game actually look like real-life "this slowly eats buildings but isn't it pretty" ivy. In the real world it's the kind of thing that would have actually overtaken Boston, as opposed to "we are barely clinging to life and look like grapevines" ivy.  #8203; What's yours?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-18 01:10:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>GAMEPLAY HAS BEEN SET FOR FRIDAY AT 7PM. If this is a significant conflict for a lot of people, we can squish the time around.  #8203; I #8217;d have to find a site that offers free board games, but I know Cards Against Humanity and Scrabble can both be played online. My synagogue is shut down for a minimum of eight weeks, and it #8217;d be nice to have some Friday night community, even if it #8217;s all online. EDIT: First, I should have said "watch this space for updates so I'm not spamming the board." My bad. Anyway, watch this space for updates so I'm not spamming the board. THAT SAID, right now thanks to people in the comments we have a few options: 1) [https://www.happymeeple.com/en/](https://www.happymeeple.com/en/) is a collection of modern board games. Not the stuff we're familiar with like Monopoly, so we'd all (or mostly all) be on new ground. It's free. 2) [https://en.boardgamearena.com/](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) includes Yahtzee and a lot more games than HappyMeeple. Looks like a lot of tabletop RPG offerings. It's free. 3) For those feeling irreverent, I checked to see if Pretend You're Xyzzy is still online. (It's a Cards Against Humanity clone.) It is, and it's also free. 4) Jackbox Games . . . . is apparently $30. Eep. I can't afford to join in that madness right now, as much as I'd like to (Quiplash ftw), but if someone who already has it or has the cash to drop wants to head up a Jackbox night, I am entirely in favor.  #8203; 5) [https://www.pogo.com/board-games?sl=2 amp;filters=board](https://www.pogo.com/board-games?sl=2 amp;filters=board) Looks like our place to go for "classic" stuff everyone is familiar with, like Monopoly, Risk, and Trivial Pursuit.  #8203; DON'T VOTE HERE. Click through them, look to see what's interesting to you, tomorrow I'll post a new thread asking for votes on where we should all meet.</TEXT>

Someone who owns it will have to confirm, but apparently as long as one participant owns it, everyone can play for free. Other options may be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/fkgyql/comment/fkv5u4r?context=3 Please select the site that sounds most interesting to you, and post it here BY NAME (not like  #8220;the third one #8221;) by 12:01am on Thursday. If a multiple-game website is picked, we #8217;ll need to choose a game, so take a look at what you think is interesting! And finally: this could be going on for awhile, so if this goes well, we could do it next week, too. Maybe in a few weeks we can all meet at Starbucks or something, and do it in person.</TEXT>

But I'd also like to be able to actually shorten travel times by using the bridge where the initial confrontation takes place.  #8203; Thing is . . . I don't want to run without the unofficial patch, and I have to have Automatron installed to use it.  #8203; Theoretically, if I got close enough to see all the robots and then deleted them (Ada included) before the shootout could finish, would it prevent the storyline from starting? Or would it just leave me with "talk to the robot" and an unfinishable DLC questline?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is going to sound very random, but . . .  #8203; As quarantine drags on, please consider paying with your card rather than cash whenever possible. (Ordering via mobile or kiosk is even better.) COVID-19 can survive on paperlike surfaces for 1-2 days, and you have no way of knowing (nor do we) where that cash was before you got it. While your card is still a risk--and I'd strongly recommend you clean it once in awhile because all kinds of nasty viruses (including COVID) and bacteria can live on there, I just learned about this for my ServSafe certification--it's touched by exponentially fewer people: you, possibly people in your home, and any cashiers you have to hand it to. Yes, we're all wearing gloves now, but the gloves we have available for cash handling *are not medical-grade.* We're wearing the same gloves used in food prep. (Sometimes not even that. My store has cheaper vinyl gloves for the cashiers and better-quality nitrile for the line.) What's that mean? It means that strictly speaking, those gloves are better than nothing, but far from foolproof.  #8203; So: Card or touchless. Cash only if absolutely 100% necessary. Please, please, and thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>. . . . that sounds kind of unclear. Let me explain.  #8203; When I see services that are streaming but directed toward people present in a physical synagogue, it feels more like I'm on the outside looking in than it does like I'm actually part of the service. I'm looking for someone doing a service that's specifically intended to be for an online audience that's in quarantine or practicing social distancing.  #8203; I'm personally Reform, but I'm more than happy to participate in a Conservative stream. (Nothing against Orthodox folks, but I'm queer and nonbinary. I don't think they'd like me very much. Also I read Hebrew but not that well yet and I'd struggle *a lot* with an Orthodox prayerbook.) And while I'm personally on US West Coast time, I "attended" a one-off quarantine Shabbat stream a couple weeks ago that was from New York--I don't mind the time zone not perfectly syncing up.  #8203; Are there any such streams out there? (If not, should I start one? I'm not a rabbi, but I can sing all the prayers and my rabbi's said if he had the money he'd send me to seminary, so like . . . I can offer at least a *little* insight.)</TEXT>

Here are the things I need to do in order to make the mod I want to make. Please keep in mind these are all in layman's terms. \--Add a way to milk brahmin and make their milk into an item. \--Add a way to tap trees for sap. Ideally, there should be two kinds: maple trees should produce maple sap (an edible item), while other trees should produce sticky sap (cook these down to make adhesive). REALLY ideally, these should recognize trees from mods that use the vanilla assets, as well as regular vanilla trees. \--Add individual recipes for about twenty new menu items. Some use these new items, some are all vanilla items. \--Add . . . icons? Objects? Anyway you should be able to drop these items on the ground and have them appear visible. \--Add milk, saps, and new food items to merchant lists. *I have no idea how to go about any of this, or what order I need to do it in.* It's the fact that I'm a visual worker and everything is *words* that's really fucking me up. How do I find things? What are commands named? Skimming these menus it's like I'm not even reading English. I need help.

    <TITLE>Unique dialogue in Emogene Takes A Lover</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-08 09:21:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>So awhile back, I killed the Pillars of the Community, mostly because I wanted to see what would happen if you did it from a far distance. (Damn, they'll track you *forever.*)  #8203; So I'm running the Cabot House quests right now, and discovered a fun thing. If you do the Emogene quest after you run into the Pillars the first time, you get a new little bit of dialogue: "I killed the last guy running this scam, just so you know."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Most people have no idea how long ago the war really was"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-10 05:43:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just finished Cabot House last night, and this is something Jack said that gives me pause.  #8203; It's 2020. If I asked anyone on this subreddit to go correctly cook me a meal on a stove from 1820, could you do it? Probably not. I'm a history buff and I have some knowledge on how it should be done, so my bread and meat might turn out *slightly* more edible than yours, but my marker for success would still be "I didn't destroy it" instead of "it tastes good."  #8203; What about technology? If I was generous and skipped you ahead to a hundred years ago and asked you to use the first radio, could you do it? (I couldn't.) Hell, if I put you in the 1960s and asked you to use a transistor radio or one of the first home TVs, could you? It's a lot more familiar than a crystal radio, but you might still struggle, especially if you're a Zennial or Zoomer.  #8203; Okay, okay. We can make the argument that a lot of things from 1820 are beyond obsolete. I won't disagree. But let's look at things we still have in a similar form: could you use 1820s makeup? (Ignoring that most of it was wildly toxic.) What if I asked you to put on 1820s clothing? This was the Regency period, and probably the point between 1600 and 1900 where clothing would look the most like it does today, but while the ladies among us might do okay with the Regency shift dresses, I'm guessing anybody who wanted to take a turn at the men's clothing would find themselves frustrated very quickly by cravats and unusual jacket hems. (And the ladies would shoot me if I made them do their hair.) How about an 1820s straight razor? Tooth powder, hair powder, hairpins, bootjacks? Do you have a clue what any of those even are?  #8203; I think the general consensus here would be "no," except maybe on the hairpins.  #8203; So with all of that said, how is it that people in FO4 are still using things from 200 years ago with relatively no problem? The clothing of the 1950s is a lot easier than the 1820s, but nobody's manufacturing zippers in 2287--how are people still using them with ease instead of buttons or ties? (Where *are* all the clothes with ties?) If the war was long enough ago that people can no longer conceive of how long ago it was, how does the technology of that time still make sense, especially given that most of it is--like stuff from 1820--obsolete? (Who's kept Takahashi in shape all this time? How are 50s-style generators still in use?)  #8203; And how much of the stuff that surrounds them everyday is stuff they just look at and go "I wonder what this was"? Things that no longer work, things that are redundant like telephones and watches . . . what do they think of them?</TEXT>

But being a guard of some kind would explain why he can travel all four parts of the park.  #8203; So I looked up Germanic folklore, because I've had this feeling all along that he's not actually a fae but rather something else, and check out what I found.  #8203; " The name ***Wiederg #228;nger*** refers to different [zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie) or ghost phenomena from different cultural areas. The word means "one who walks again" in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language).

They usually cause problems and frighten living people. They exist either to avenge some injustice they experienced while alive, or because their [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul) is not ready to be released, as a consequence of their former way of life."  #8203; Could he be a wiederg #228;nger?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Yet another possible reason Warin chose Leah</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-11 12:06:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>If I'm right, she really is fucked.  #8203; So to start:  #8203; Part Two: Leah tells us she doesn't meet Warin until she's been on the job a month. Thus, the reason she was "doomed from the minute she set foot in the park" wasn't him. Three other things of interest happen: Warin shows her his wounds almost immediately (in fact Leah has to tell him to basically stop giving her a striptease), and Mitchell seems eager to keep her away from him--first being rattled that Darius isn't the one who picks up the walkie when Mitchell asks for help, and then storming into the breakroom after saying he'd wait outside. Interestingly, although we know Warin enjoys freaking people out, there's no mention anywhere else in the story of him going all Magic Mike on someone--only Leah. And finally: Warin drools on her. Gross, not apparently immediately harmful, but worth keeping in mind because of Part Three. Part Three: Leah meets Moth. (The Mime.) Again, she gets drooled on. This is also where the mysterious rock-thrower comes from. *I don't think it was Warin.* He made no bones about stepping in visibly when he got between Leah and Mulberry (SPF), which leads me to believe it was someone else. I'm kind of wondering if that someone else was Dale.  #8203; Part Four: just for levity's sake, I decided to point out here that Dale apparently has no idea what it looks like when a woman hits on you. (We could all use a bit of cheer at this point in the story, frankly, could we not?) On a more serious note, though, this is when we first see his notebook, and Leah comments to us, the readers, that she had the thought it looked like he was speaking incantations out of it. Interesting that's the first thing she jumped to.  #8203; Part Five: Leah gets her first look at the contract. (Which, yes, does appear to be written down, although she didn't read most of it.) She also tells Warin that if he ever needs anything, he should let her know. Wording is important here: *she tells him to tell her, but does not agree to fix whatever the problem might be.*  #8203; Part Seven: Warin writes out Leah's name. Prior to this, she hadn't even mentioned it to us, and there's no mention of her introducing herself to Warin. He had to get her name from somewhere, but where?  #8203; Part Nine: When Dale accuses Leah of "doing detective work behind his back," his immediate response is to stammer "what?" confusedly, then immediately jump to another line of conversation.  #8203; Part Ten: Leah gives Warin a gift. If she owed him anything after Part Five, it's now been repaid, but there is some question of whether it's adequate. Given his response, I'm going to go with yes.  #8203; Part Thirteen: Leah has a vision of a little girl when she enters the bathroom. It seems likely this is Millie, based on how the vision goes. Here's the interesting part: *Leah is an active part of this vision.* She reaches for the little girl, who seems to be lost out in a field, and the little girl actively reacts. Also, Leah has a reaction to the restroom--Darius doesn't.  #8203; Part Fourteen: Leah looks in the mirror in the bathroom and sees a stranger. Notably, this is different from the most recent installation, where she knows the reflection is hers but feels detached from it; in this case, she actively sees someone else.  #8203; Part Fifteen: Dale checks that Leah remembers her name. He confirms that Leah is turning, but also that she shouldn't be, because nothing has happened to trigger the process. He also states that Leah isn't bound by anything the way he is, but he hesitates when saying it. And finally, we find out that his self-injury is scarification--in case he forgets his name, as he tested with Leah.  #8203;  #8203; So where does all this leave us?  #8203; It leaves us with someone who's apparently a hell of a lot more insightful than previous researchers have been, who was instantly picked by Warin as someone to taunt with his real nature, and who's affected by the realm of the Wild Ones when nobody else around her is.  #8203; What brought this to my mind was this: we're told that Colt is in his thirties when the fatal bargain is struck.  #8203; It seems pretty weird for a man in his thirties in the 1800s to not be married, harelip or no harelip, doesn't it? Like okay, maybe he was gay or unlucky, but I find it far more likely he had a wife who went unmentioned. And where there's a wife in the 1800s, there are kids.  #8203; A wife and kids who might have run away after the bargain claimed the man of the house.  #8203; What if Leah is a direct descendant, and the reason she was chosen--and doomed from the moment she set foot in the park--is because Colt's widow broke the bargain by running, and so now it's her descendants that have to pay for it? Is it possible, since Warin wears Colt's face, that Mitchell noticed a physical resemblance between Colt/Warin and Leah, and that's why he's been so gung-ho to keep her away from him?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-14 09:04:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like, let's start here: what he was going to do to Leah was a dick move.  #8203; *BUT.*  #8203; It is an *understandable* dick move. He's in love with Nathan. The point he decided to help Leah was the point when Leah decided to help Nathan. Dale has been in a no-win situation literally since he was born, and it's only gotten worse. The idea that maybe everything could be okay, maybe he could get his partner back, maybe he'd have this bit of comfort, is a deeply, *deeply* tempting one, especially when you add love into the mix.  #8203; But now he's in a situation where either Nathan dies (and Dale loses him completely), or Nathan finds out the bargain Dale was going to make (and Dale loses him completely).  #8203; Like.  #8203; It really fucking sucks to be Dale and I feel badly for him. The vast majority of the things that have happened to him *are not his fault* and were decided for him over a century ago, and his attempt to fix things only made them worse.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Was A Stagecoach Driver; Now I'm Not (the completely unauthorized sequel)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-16 12:22:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Okay, to be clear: this isn't *completely* unauthorized. /u/girl_from_the_crypt gave me her blessing to write it as long as I made it clear I'm not her and this is a fan work. With that said, the only thing she knows about it is that I expressed a desire to see Nathan kick some ass, now that his ass is no longer limited to a box seat. So this isn't canon. But if you want to know what *might* have happened after the end . . . here you go. And yes, there will be parts.)  #8203; Two weeks after it was all over, I found out it barely started. I should probably explain. My name is Nathan. If you've read my friend Leah's posts, you already know some of what I've gone through. That's why today I found myself back in a place I swore I'd never go again. I thought I'd update you all, since things are even weirder than normal in this part of the world right now. There are some things nobody tells you about trying to reclaim your identity after a decade of not existing. Like how to explain to the DMV why you don't have an ID to replace, for example. Or discovering that if you have two hundred bucks in the bank, and don't touch it for ten years, at the end of the ten years you'll have a whole two hundred and fifteen or so. Also, you're really not going to want to go back home to see what your boyfriend's done with the place. And so I ended up going back to work, instead. Dale looked stunned when I showed up in his office. Not surprising, I guess. I rode in with Mitchell, but he apparently didn't think Dale deserved the heads up, and I still don't have a phone, so this morning it was just Mitchell checking in on the horses and me standing in front of Dale's desk while he stared at me with his mouth open and his coffee halfway to it, apparently forgotten.  #8220;Let's start here, #8221; I told him.  #8220;This isn't a reunion visit. I still don't know where we stand, not anymore. I do know nobody's looking to hire somebody with a ten-year gap in their employment history, not right now. So. Do I still have a job? Or at least back pay? #8221; Dale looked like he hasn't been sleeping well since the whole trying-to-renegotiate-the-contract thing. It hit me right around the time I noticed the bags under his eyes that he was probably realizing I was wearing a sweater far too big for me and a pair of jeans that clearly weren't actually mine. Was it cruel to show up at his office in another man's clothes? Probably, but it's not like I have much of a choice in what I'm wearing right now. At last he cleared his throat.  #8220;I don't know if I can convince them on back pay, #8221; he whispered. I know the financials are actually his job, but I decided not to call him on it. After all, I did throw it at him out of nowhere. At eight o'clock in the morning, no less.  #8220;But I'll find a way to make the job work. That's the absolute least of what I owe you. #8221; I thought about saying something nasty back, but didn't. I need the job. And also I still haven't made up my mind about whether I could trust him with a second chance. Feelings are some real bullshit that way. Instead I told him I appreciated it.  #8220;But, #8221; I told him,  #8220;if you tell me you need me riding that coach again, contract or no contract, I'm going to tell you exactly where you can stick it, Dale. #8221;  #8220;Would it make you feel better if you did? #8221; I think I sort of blinked at him. It's been so long I barely remember the nooks and crannies of his sense of humor anymore.  #8220;I don't know. Maybe? #8221;  #8220;Then I'm going to need you to drive the coach. #8221;  #8220;Dale, you can take that stagecoach, and you can #8212; #8221; I was halfway through saying it when I caught the look on his face. I really did forget that morbid streak adjacent to his funnybone. I started chuckling, and then he started, and thirty seconds later I was in the chair in front of his desk bent over laughing. It wasn't even funny, really, but there's a real learning curve to becoming human again. Last week I was crying over a Jeopardy commercial. And unlike the commercial, this had the one-two punch of being like #8212;  #8212;well, you know. Before. He finally pushed his coffee across the desk at me. He probably meant for me to take a sip and calm down, but instead I just stopped laughing and pushed it back. It was already half gone, probably safe to drink, but still. Still. Dale looked down at the desk and cleared his throat.  #8220;No, #8221; he said, finally.  #8220;I don't need you on the coach. Or want you there. Mitchell took it over #8212;*voluntarily*, don't look at me like that, Nate. It's not more dangerous than any of the other pretenders now. Not since, let's say, its *former owner* left the premises. He . . . he can get off again. When it's time to go home. #8221; Dale took a deep breath and tapped the top of his desk like he was closing a conversational door.  #8220;I'll tell you what you could do, for a start. You know Twin Vale probably better than anyone else on the grounds. You could show Madeleine around while I . . . get things moving. She's going to be taking point. As the above-ground leader. I was able to get her approved since the contract was breached. It's not perfect, but it's better. #8221; If the morning had ended there, I wouldn't be here now, telling you about it. But it didn't #8212;I stopped in the horror section, thinking I'd say hello to anyone who happened to be there, and spotted Leah sitting by the haunted hospital with Mr. Scratch rolling around at her feet. Just a girl and her monster-dog . . . except for the way she was staring. Sort of off and into the distance, like a painting. I had to call her name twice to get her attention, and when I finally did she didn't seem at all surprised to see me. She just bounced to her feet and headed my way, still just a little bit . . . off, somehow.  #8220;I knew you'd be back, #8221; she told me, and then I realized where that sense of offness was coming from: even though the park isn't open yet, she was in costume. And then she said something else, something I could never imagine my empathetic friend from the stagecoach saying. That something else is why I'm here on this forum right now. Let me tell you, I haven't felt this painfully self-aware of being ten years behind the times since Mitchell tried to show me how to use his tablet. But Leah is easily the best friend I've ever had, and I think she's in trouble, and that means I have to use whatever tools I can find to help her. You all know her better than I do, so this seems like a good place to start. Does it sound like her, do you think, to look at the park, and smile, and say  #8220;there's something in it that just makes you never want to leave #8221;?  #8203; [Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g2z86f/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Getting Human Again (Part Two)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-17 10:11:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g2dwa4/i_was_a_stagecoach_driver_now_im_not_the/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf) Thanks for the responses, guys. I don't know that it means anything, not yet, but I'm keeping an eye on Leah. I guess I should tell you what's going on now. Dale called Mitchell last night and asked to talk to me. I used to wonder why he sounded so exhausted after  #8220;board meetings. #8221; I guess now I know, huh? He didn't even bother with the pretense last night #8212;just said  #8220;I talked to them. #8221; A couple of people have been pretty upset about me not getting back pay. I appreciate you guys having my back, but apparently it's not as simple as writing a check. We get paid a hell of a lot better than most amusement park employees because of taking care of the pretenders, and ten years' worth of base pay #8212;not even counting the annual raises that kick in after year two, mind you #8212;would be enough to buy a house. Maybe two. Any amount that large has to go through upper management, and that's before I have the problem of explaining to the bank how I ended up with almost half a million dollars overnight. So Dale made my case, and upper management said no. Dale had a hell of a fight with them over it, or at least that's what I gathered today. He said he's still going to try and see if he can't get at least part of it on the basis of how it puts the park in violation of labor laws or something. But he also had news about my new job--which cost him a serious set of scratches he was forced to give himself, and I feel like I seriously owe him something for that--and part of me wants to scream every filthy word I know and part of me wants to laugh myself senseless. Anyway, I turned up in his office today in jeans and a flannel shirt to pick up my new phone and my cowboy hat and find out if Target's finest passed muster with a company spokesperson, meaning Madeleine. She thought I was delightful. Dale gave me this sort of noncommittal noise, like he didn't want to actually comment on my appearance in case I took it the wrong way. At least, that's what he did until I turned to leave, and then I heard this kind of *squeak!* I haven't heard, hell. Probably since we first started dating. I turned back and raised my eyebrows. He was making the kind of face that said he didn't want to say anything because he'd start laughing.  #8220;Want to share the joke? #8221;  #8220;Nate, where'd you get those jeans? #8221; I looked down at them to make sure I didn't grab a pair with a ripped-out crotch or something, but they looked fine. Almost new.  #8220;Mitchell's place? #8221;  #8220;Might want to get a different pair before the first. #8221;  #8220;Because . . . ? #8221; I knew there was no way he was going to keep a straight face, but I didn't expect him to just whip out his phone and take a picture of my ass.  #8220;Hey! #8221; He held out the phone before he put his head down on his desk and laughed. I took the phone and looked at the pockets, and so basically tonight my legs hurt like you wouldn't believe from chasing Mitchell all the way across the park for giving me his girlfriend's old jeans and Dale has a picture of my butt covered in white and purple rhinestones. He told me he's saving it for blackmail material, the asshole. With me heading back into Twin Vale to take Warin's place as an actual actor, the number of actors and pretenders has remained the same but fallen totally out of balance. I'm not minding a pretender, and Madeleine is joining Candyland as a pretender without an actor. That puts three of us in Twin Vale and five of us in Candyland, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a vaguely uneasy feeling about it. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just the idea of things being out of whack after so long. Speaking of new, Leah wasn't at work today, even though she pretty much never misses. I guess she and Anne and Maxine went out for lunch since the park reopens in less than two weeks. It was a relief, hearing that. Seeing her sitting on that wall with Monster Mutt yesterday was totally unnerving. I did text her my new number, since Dale got me a phone. It took about half an hour before I heard back, but when I did it was by phone call, with a very loud background, and Leah doing that thing where you laugh so hard you sound drunk even when you're not. She asked me a question about the Silmarillion, and as soon as I stammered out an answer I heard her laugh-yell  #8220;see, I told you it wasn't in the book #8221; before saying  #8220;thanks, love you, bye #8221; and hanging up. I have no idea how she knew I used to be into Lord of the Rings, but I was so stunned by anybody but Dale ending a phone call to me with  #8220;I love you #8221; I don't think I could've asked her if I'd tried. Maybe Dale unearthed some Halloween pictures from the year I dragged him with me as Frodo and Sam. It's been ten years and people are still bitching about black hobbits being unrealistic, but Dale has that Sean Astin look down pat, and with the two of us together (complete with furry slippers) you couldn't mistake us for any other literary pair if you tried. I'll have to ask Leah where she found out the next time I see her. Come to that, I wouldn't mind seeing the photos again, either, if Dale still has them. I haven't mentioned that weird feeling about Leah to anyone else yet. We've been working together for up to five years, some of us, but nobody here has ever really gotten to know me, except her. I'm not sure they'd take me seriously if I brought it up. Not yet, anyway. I have to go pick up jeans and a pair of boots tomorrow to break in before the season starts, so I'm going to see if I can get her to go with me. I have this feeling the more time she spends out of the park, the better. I'll keep you guys posted if anything new comes up.

    <TITLE>I Was A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm The Watchman (Part Three)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-18 10:05:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g2z86f/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Well, today was . . . interesting. Leah picked me up this morning and immediately handed me a ziploc bag. Apparently I make pretty funny faces when I'm shocked, because she started giggling.  #8220;You found milk and cereal bars! #8221; She shook her head.  #8220;I think they've been discontinued everywhere, but I found a couple of copycat recipes online. They're . . . okay, I guess. I think it's one of the weirdest things I've ever eaten. #8221;  #8220;Says the freak who drinks raspberry Mountain Dew. #8221; I managed to eat three of the bars on the way to the mall. They're not the same as the ones I used to grab on the way out the door #8212;I think it's mostly the telltale flavor of preservatives that's missing #8212;but close enough. Of course, I've also discovered that when you haven't eaten in four or five years, *everything* tastes different. I ate a banana the other day and I swear they weren't sweet the last time I had one. Also, if you think there's something stupid about accepting unwrapped food from someone in the park, I know what you're thinking. I'd know that smell anywhere these days. And I could be wrong, but I think Leah and Dale are probably the two people I need to worry about least #8212;Leah because she's been through the same thing, Dale because at some point in the last ten years he turned into the kind of person who keeps a bottle of whiskey in the bottom desk drawer and dresses like a hobo, and I don't think it's entirely because of general park stress. I'll give him this, he seems like he's genuinely trying to make things right. And he basically wouldn't let me leave the park yesterday until I took his credit card to go get clothes, on the basis that if he hadn't landed me in limbo for ten years I wouldn't need new everything. Which is how I ended up with six bags of clothes, a couple of new books, and glasses. Leah dragged me to one of those walk-in places after she saw me at Burger King, in her words,  #8220;squinting at the menu like you're trying to be a film noir detective. #8221; Two hours later, I walked out with a pair of those quickie frames and an immediate decision to get contacts. I don't seem to have picked up any facial lines or anything during my time on the stagecoach, but apparently driving around from dawn to dusk every day for ten years is hell on your vision. We ended up back at Leah's, going through clothes to cut off tags and watching Skyfall. I almost dropped my Pepsi toward the end. Leah didn't get why Bond saying he had a gay fling was such a big deal. That's good, I guess. At least not *everything* has gone to hell while I was away. Apparently there's a prequel trilogy to LOTR now, too. I'm not going to run out of movies anytime soon. You might be wondering why any of this was interesting. And honestly, that part isn't. It's just . . . you have to understand how normal the morning was to understand all the weirdness of the rest. I noticed a weird smell in Leah's apartment as soon as I stepped in, but I didn't want to say anything. That's just rude, you know? I kind of wondered if maybe there was a problem with the pipes in the building, but when she opened the fridge to offer me a pop the smell got stronger and I knew exactly what it was. She'd had vegetables in the fridge so long they'd gone rotten. There was dust on the TV remote, too, when I went to turn up the volume. And when I went to the bathroom, the tub had that weird bone-dry look you see in houses that've been empty for awhile, like it's not just dry but dehydrated. All of that is weird enough, but it gets weirder. *Leah didn't seem to notice any of this.* If it was someone else, I'd say they were a slob. But Leah's always looked neat and clean. When she brought me clean clothes, they smelled fresh. Hell, when I saw her after she fell off the stagecoach she had bandages so expertly done they could've come off a movie set. Nothing I know about her lines up with a grody apartment. She kept squirming through the movie, too, and a couple of times I saw her reach under her shirt to scratch her back. I'm not entirely sure why that bothers me so much. Some people have dry skin, sometimes your body just decides it wants to be an asshole for a little while, there's nothing weird about having an itch. But something about this *was*. I don't know how to explain it to you. Dale would call it my spidey sense, and I guess that's as good a word as any. Leah asked if I wanted to stay over, and since I don't want to be that person who stays for  #8220;a couple of days #8221; six weeks long, I took her up on it and gave Mitchell a call. Leah's got an actual air mattress instead of a couch, too, which is great. I appreciate Mitchell letting me stay, don't get me wrong, but it's really nice to be able to stretch. It's night now. I'm still worried about Leah. We ordered pizza for dinner, and she ate #8212;while laughing at me because I'm now in several-years-delayed mourning at the death of the twisted crust pizza #8212;but she seemed not entirely there, somehow, and afterward I was the one who moved the leftovers into the fridge because it seemed like she forgot all about them. I ended up calling Dale after she went to bed. Call me stupid, but I wanted to hear his voice. And to see if he could offer up an explanation for Leah's behavior. I caught him just before he left the park. Apparently with only a few days to go before reopening day the Ferris wheel threw a linchpin during safety testing, so after he and Gary #8212;Gary's the head of maintenance, he seems like a pretty decent guy #8212;found the pin and found out it was rusted through they had to replace it, and then do a manual check of every single nut and bolt and pin on the whole damned thing, and *then* Dale had to do paperwork for the health and safety people. And you know the worst part of the whole thing? In the end they had to replace one linchpin, one bolt, and a lightbulb. Nine hours' work for three pieces I could hold in my hand, and if the work wasn't done properly it could kill people. Even when you take the eldritch abominations out of the question, I am *so* glad I don't do Dale's job. Since he was still there, I asked if he could check on something for me. He wasn't happy about it #8212;and I don't blame him, I wouldn't be either #8212;but he went. After the whole thing with Warin, the window to the  #8220;out of order #8221; bathroom was screwed shut. I wanted to know if the screws were still there. Dale said they were, and then I heard this awful rusty *clunk*, and then he came back to the phone line.  #8220;Window's sealed, the back stall is sealed, the door's locked and I had the key changed. There's no way she got in there again. #8221;  #8220;Do you happen to know if #8212; #8221; and this is the part that pisses me off, the part I'm finding it so hard to forgive, not the changing but the leaving #8212; #8220;did anyone ever tell you if I was this spacey when I first got on the coach? #8221; There was this big long pause. I'm pretty sure he was trying to stop himself from crying.  #8220;No. Nobody did. #8221; There was another pause, but this one was shorter.  #8220;And Leah isn't, normally, either. #8221; We didn't talk for long after that. I told him I should let him get on the road. He told me I'll never believe how many devices use Bluetooth these days, but he let me go anyway. So now I'm sitting here filling you all in. I don't know what's wrong with Leah, but it's getting more and more obvious the Wild Ones aren't done with her. I'm not sure how, or why. But I know I have to put a stop to it.  #8203;  #8203; [Part Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g46lts/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Hot Mess Instead (Part Four)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-19 12:06:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g3l6vt/i_was_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not_im_the/)  #8203; Well, it couldn't be avoided forever. I went into the park today to help Mitchell with the stagecoach, because apparently the horses weren't taking so well to someone new. I expected it to be a mystery that'd take hours to solve #8212;if I could solve it #8212;but actually, it's just that Mitchell is left-handed and kept trying to get up on the wrong side of the box seat. It's funny, sometimes, the things that drive the pretenders nuts. Anyway, I still don't have a car, and I came in with Leah, so that left me to bum around the park and try to get reacquainted with parts I haven't seen in what feels like a thousand years. The horror section is almost completely tested and ready to go for next week, so I decided to see if Darius was in and if, possibly, I could sweet-talk him into turning on one of the dark rides so I could have a turn. Darius was not in. Dale was, though, and it was my luck he was, in fact, doing a test run on the exact ride I was hoping to catch. So much for that, I thought, and I thought I'd go catch Leah instead, but Dale saw me and waved me over. I didn't really want to go #8212;for a whole host of reasons I'm sure are obvious #8212;but he's currently my boss, so I went. He shut down the switchboard outside the ride and raised his eyebrows at me.  #8220;Glasses? #8221;  #8220;Hate them already. I'm getting contacts. I thought all the safety testing over here was done? #8221;  #8220;Mostly. Haunted Hospital's the last one to check. I'm just re-timing strobes right now. Can we talk? #8221; #8220;I guess. #8221; Dale suggested we eat in Hollywood. The restaurants are still all shut down, but the Hollywood breakroom has one of those vending machines in it that has sandwiches and stuff, and if you swipe a park ID the entrees are free. It sounded as good as anything else to me, so we picked up lunch in the breakroom and headed for the pianist's restaurant to eat. I really didn't want to hear Dale beg. Or even try to lay out a case for getting a second chance. He didn't, though. What actually happened might have been worse, in a way where sometimes you just don't want the better option. Dale sat down, took a sip of his Coke, and then gave me the I-don't-want-to-be-doing-this-either look. He started with  #8220;listen, #8221; and I was ready to cut him off before he held up a hand.  #8220;I already know how you feel. And why. I'm not going to try to tell you to hurry up and sift through a decade in two weeks. But the only way you being here works #8212;from the human side, that is #8212;is if you and I can actually work together. I'm reasonably sure nobody else on the crew would accuse me of playing favorites, but nobody's going to want to tiptoe around dynamite while we get our shit together. Once those gates open, if there's bad blood between any of us, the guests will know, too, and I don't want that. If I have to run this hellhole I might as well make it worth it for the people who show up. #8221; I haven't cried about what fell out between us for probably seven or eight years, but I almost did then. At some point when I wasn't around my sweet, daydreamy boy turned into a sad-eyed pragmatist with the first few strands of gray creeping too early into his hair. I really hope when Leah took Warin out she made him suffer, the son of a bitch. Finally I just nodded, and did my best to smile like he hadn't just killed me with five short sentences.  #8220;I can work with that. Thank you. #8221; He gave me the same smile back. Between the two of us, I'm pretty sure we should be nominated for an Oscar.  #8220;How's Leah? #8221;  #8220;I don't know. I really don't. #8221; I ran back over the same weird stuff I told him about last night before adding another three to the pile: a sad, wilted plant I noticed in the window, a weirdly empty spice rack on the counter, and #8212;equal parts amusing and alarming #8212;a *very* specific look, aimed at me, from one of her elderly neighbors. I finished up with that uneasy feeling I shared with you all yesterday #8212;just something wrong, something I couldn't name or define but knew as clearly as I know my own name. Dale frowned when I finished up.  #8220;Nothing in the rebuilt contract should affect her this way, #8221; he finally told me.  #8220;I know she made a deal with . . . certain parties I won't name #8212;and I'd prefer you don't, either #8212;to get you back. I wouldn't be surprised if he turned that deal around on her. But if he's gone, the effect of that deal should be null. #8221;  #8220;*Is* he actually gone? #8221; Dale sighed and took three whole bites of his instant soup before he answered me. I got the feeling he was trying to word things #8212;not stall. One thing I've picked up pretty quickly, wording things exactly right to minimize harm might be the most important part of Dale's job.  #8220;I'll tell you the truth, Nate, I don't know. He and I broke our respective contract terms on the same day, within hours of each other, and both without the other knowing. As far as I can gather, that made us both equally culpable. I can't imagine he got much forgiveness below for breaking the contract, especially since he went directly against the wishes of the group. At the same time, after he disappeared, Leah and I both noticed the window into the central bathroom open. I also can't imagine he'd go back if he didn't think his survival was reasonably assured. I wish I had a better answer for you. #8221; Lunch was pretty quiet for awhile after that. When we started talking again, it was the kind of meaningless bullshit you talk when you have nothing else to say. Leah's on both of our minds, I'm sure of that. I thought about asking Dale for a meeting with the other actors to see what we can come up with, but that runs me into another problem: Leah would have to be present at any such meeting, and I don't think she knows what's happening to her. Or maybe it's better to say I don't think she knows anything is happening, period. I'm the only test case we've got for someone reversing course after starting a transformation, and what happened to me doesn't match up with what's happening to her at all. I didn't know why I suddenly didn't need to sleep and couldn't leave the park, but I knew it was happening, and I was aware for the whole thing. Leah's still coming and going freely and acting like nothing's changed, but she's having weird lapses in memory and attention. I think maybe the best thing I can do at this point is to tackle the rest of the actors one or two at a time. They still might not be ready to believe me by myself as that guy they've all worked with but never properly met, but I've got Dale to back me up now on her weird behavior. And with opening day drawing ever closer, I should probably take the chance to at least say hello to them all anyway. I just hope we can pin down the problem before it gets worse.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I Tease The Animals (Part Five)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 10:44:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g46lts/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) Progress! . . . kind of. First, I should tell you all I did the stupidest thing in the park today that I've done since I accepted a certain Coke. And it was totally worth it. I reread Leah's account of the last few months last night to get an idea who I should start with today, but before I could make a decision myself I literally #8212;and I do mean literally #8212;ran into Anne at the entrance. Hard enough I almost knocked her over, actually. I didn't, but this is what I get for rediscovering Angry Birds. Anne caught her balance pretty quickly, though, and then gave me this huge, dazzling smile. I kind of wonder if she was a cheerleader in high school.  #8220;Hi! So we finally actually meet, #8221; she said, and stuck out her hand to shake.  #8220;Dale said you're still going to be in Twin Vale. Are you, um . . . okay? With, you know, everything? #8221;  #8220;Not totally, but I'm taking it as an excuse to basically dance on that asshole's grave, and that's helping a lot. #8221; She gave me that giant smile again, and when she said she had to head into Candyland I asked to go with her. She shared a little with me about opening procedures, since I'd never actually been part of them before, and told me a little about staff I haven't met yet but will once non-actor crew start coming back in more regularly. I think she ended up laughing at me when we walked into Candyland and I went running straight to the carousel. That might sound weird, going straight for the merry-go-round like a kindergartener, but you've probably never been on a carousel like the one in this park. It's the original one from the 1800s that first turned on its lights here when the park was a fairground. You can still see where the brass rings were and everything. Only a few of the horses have been replaced in all that time, and the ones that have been are carved from wood just like the originals. You can tell which ones are new because they're different animals, tigers and dragons and stuff, but they have the same glass gems and detailed paint as the horses. I honestly thought I'd never see it again. I used to sneak on after my shift was over and ride it when the end-of-night music was playing. I couldn't imagine Dale getting rid of it, not after over a hundred years, but it was great to see it was still there. At least until the fucking mime dropped in front of me, that is. I did tell you guys I did something stupid. If you're wondering if the stupid thing might have been provoking the mime . . . yeah, it was. Not much, but I did call him a motherfucker and ask if he missed his boyfriend. He hissed at me and tried to grab my shoulders. I ducked and told him I bite when I'm provoked, and that's about when Anne came running up, wailing apologies and dragging him away.  #8220;He was fine, and then he saw you and just . . . lost it, #8221; she told me a few minutes later, after she'd pulled him off to his cage.  #8220;I don't think he really cares about . . . you know who, but he can tell you, you know . . .  #8221; She sort of blushed and looked down. That's going to be a problem, I think. Nobody here except Leah is willing to just take  #8220;you were stuck as a freak of nature for a decade, but you're not now #8221; as a basic fact of life. Water is wet, the sky is up, I used to be a pretender.  #8220;I wasn't human for awhile. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, that. #8221; I suggested maybe this wasn't the best place for me to be for an afternoon, if Anne wanted to let the mime run free for a couple more days, and she walked me back toward the front of the park. I almost forgot why I'd gone looking for her in the first place, but she stopped me just outside the office with a look like she'd been pulling together her courage for the last hour or so.  #8220;Hey, Nathan? #8221; she asked me.  #8220;Have you talked to Leah lately? Other than when she called you the other day? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, I'm staying with her right now. #8221; I had the feeling she was going to ask a specific question. I wasn't wrong.  #8220;Has she seemed . . . not totally there? To you? #8221; She didn't have to ask me twice, of course. I spilled everything about the apartment to her, and about seeing Leah sitting in the horror world like some kind of creepy doll. Anne's shoulders dropped like she was going to cry, but in that way where someone finally believes you. And then Anne shared her half, and I hated hearing it because I don't want to see Leah literally fade in front of me, but I was glad to know it's not just me. Apparently, the lunch I saw her go to was the first time since the deal that anyone from the park had been able to get her to go anywhere. Anne and Maxine both noticed she seemed distracted;  #8220;hectic #8221; was the word Maxine used, while Anne went with  #8220;desperate. #8221; Both agreed she didn't seem to realize how she was coming across, and when Maxine suggested they should see if I'd check in on Mr. Scratch for a couple of days so they could take a pre-season long weekend, Leah got agitated and upset. By the time Anne finished, she was almost in tears. So I asked if any of the others might know more. And that's how we ended up in an almost-all-the-actors staff meeting after all. A couple of people weren't in today, but pretty much everyone who was agreed: either they didn't see Leah often enough to know if she was being weird or not, or she's gotten *very* weird. And then they all looked at me. It's funny how sometimes you can tell exactly what people are thinking. So I just said it.  #8220;We didn't go through the process the same way. But she's turning into a pretender, and if we want to stop it, I don't think we have very long. #8221;  #8220;So how do we do it? #8221; I was kind of surprised to hear the question from Oliver first. I got the impression he and Leah didn't really talk. It doesn't surprise me the others would want to help her, though. Leah is the kind of person you can't help liking. It's nerve-wracking being the only person here with any kind of experience this way, though. I know barely anything and I still know more than anyone else. Except . . .  #8220;I think finding out how it works is our first step. And that's going to mean tackling Dale. #8221;  #8220;He'll talk to you before any of us, #8221; was Darius' opinion, and he's probably not wrong, but personal opinion here, being friendly with Dale and shelving the relationship question until later means not trading on any hopes he's got.  #8220;If we go as a group he's more likely to cave. #8221; Or would have been ten years ago, at least. We agreed to see if we can't ambush him tomorrow, as a group, and maybe #8212;possibly #8212;get some answers. I'm just hoping he has them.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Gang Leader (Part Six)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-21 11:54:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Five](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g4qjwf/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not_i/)  #8203; Well, today didn't go . . . badly. I kind of wonder a little bit what Dale thought when he walked in and saw six of us all piled outside his office. I was there, of course, but so were Anne and Maxine and Darius. I'm not sure if Oliver was interested in joining the press gang or if he got dragged by Mitchell, but by the time Dale got in the only two people missing were Caroline #8212;not yet in for the day #8212;and, of course, Leah herself, who'd gotten in with me and made a beeline straight for Mr. Scratch. Dale's gotten a lot better at poker faces in the last ten years. Either that, or I'm completely out of practice at reading him. He just looked at us all and sighed.  #8220;If this is a mass walkout, you all picked a hell of a time to do it. #8221; Dale threw me for enough of a loop I didn't have an immediate answer for him. It was Maxine who spoke up.  #8220;This is a mass 'our friend is in trouble,' Dale. #8221; Dale looked at me. I'm pretty sure he was waiting for me to say psych, but of course I didn't, and finally he just shook his head and motioned us all to the weeping willow. There's not enough space in his office for seven people. Strictly speaking, there's not enough space in his office for two people, sometimes.  #8220;Okay, #8221; he said, once we were all settled.  #8220;Shoot. #8221;  #8220;Let's start here. #8221; I should probably tell you all Leah and Warin gave you a very biased picture of me. Leah saw me during her telling only as someone in desperate need of help, and to Warin, of course, I was a plaything. I'm not as much of a hardass as some people, but I'm not a pushover, either.  #8220;Is it true you were going to trade Leah for me, when you were negotiating with someone we're not mentioning? #8221; . . . actually, sometimes I'm just a bastard. I thought he might try to say no, especially in the face of five other people going into a minor uproar, but he just put his head down and ran his fingers into his hair.  #8220;I thought about it. I wasn't a fan of the idea. But I wasn't a fan of leaving you when I had the opportunity to save you, either. #8221; He gave me this kind of helpless look. I decided not to give him the slack.  #8220;The way I see it, Dale, you owe her. She might've told you she was okay with it, but I don't forgive that easily. She tried to help you and you turned on her. So spill. #8221; Anne took over before I could ask anything.  #8220;How are pretenders made? That's really what we're here for. We can't stop it if we don't know how it starts. #8221; Dale gave me one last pleading look for an out, but honestly, after rereading Leah's story again, I'm less interested in giving him another chance than ever. It's nice to think he finally got around to giving a shit, but not at someone else's expense. At last he shook his head.  #8220;I've only seen it as an adult once. As a kid . . . I don't remember much. Laila was here one day and gone the next, and a couple of weeks later the nurse showed up on the grounds and scared the bejeezus out of me. Of course, she got turned mid-season, too. Wouldn't surprise me if the official story was she quit, and my parents just kept her out of sight until . . . everything was over. You know what happened to you. And I'm not convinced you took the . . . normal route. I'm pretty sure the someone we're not mentioning was keeping you in stasis of some kind. You wouldn't have finished the process until I retired. #8221;  #8220;So once someone starts, you only have a couple of weeks? #8221; Oliver was giving Dale this look like he couldn't believe Dale hadn't said anything before we all ambushed him.  #8220;What about Leah? #8221;Dale just kind of shook his head at all of us.  #8220;I know the more poison you drink, the faster the process. I don't know how much she took. And I don't know if the process can be reversed in the absence of . . . certain parties. #8221;  #8220;Just so we're clear, is there a reason we're not naming him? #8221; Mitchell actually scared me when he spoke up. Or startled me, more like, I guess. I'd forgotten he was there, but I didn't need Dale to answer this one.  #8220;Names have power. And it's not totally clear what happened to him. If he's gone, fuck him. If he's not . . . I'd rather not have his attention back here when we're trying to deal with this, you know? #8221; I don't think anybody expected me to field that one, but you do pick up a few things, riding around Twin Vale all day with nothing to do but think. Mitchell kind of made this  #8220;fair enough #8221; face and focused back on Dale.  #8220;So what do we do? #8221; Dale shook his head and spread his hands.  #8220;Not a clue, Mitchell. I don't have a damned clue. This isn't related to my family's contract. I don't have any say in it. And I don't know how much more I can tell you. See if you can brainstorm something, if you want. Look for loopholes. Try to spend time with her while you can, just in case. #8221;  #8220;And if we find a way out, #8221; Darius chimed in,  #8220;you'll help us save her? #8221;  #8220;If I'm able. #8221;  #8220;We're all going to hold you to that, you know, #8221; Anne told him, and then everyone got up in such perfect unison it was like we'd rehearsed it. The other five had pretenders to check on, but that left me standing with Dale. I thought he might try to justify himself again, but he didn't. The hell of it is, I agree with Leah on this one: I understand why he thought it. I might have, too, if our positions were reversed. And he was panicking. But I don't think I could have seriously considered it, and that's where we differ. If the contract was that close to broken, there had to be a way to get me out without throwing someone else under the bus. Dale turned around to head to his office, and that's when I had the idea.  #8220;Do you have a notebook? #8221; I thought he was going to ignore me, but he didn't.  #8220;Notebook? #8221;  #8220;Loose-leaf, if you've got one, but I'll settle for spiral. #8221;  #8220;I've got some legal pads. #8221;  #8220;Can I buy one from you? #8221; I never thought I'd see a grown man get that close to crying over a notebook, but it happened.  #8220;Nate #8212; #8221;  #8220;There's a reason I'm asking. That isn't because I'm pissed at you. And a pen. What's the going price for a pen and a legal pad? Fair exchange. You give your price, I decide if I want the pad that badly. #8221; I saw his eyebrows go up when I said *fair exchange.* And good #8212;good. He got it. Maybe not all of it, but he knew why I put it that way.  #8220;Did you bring lunch? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. I convinced Leah to let me cook last night. Mostly so I could clear out her fridge, but I cooked. #8221; #8220;Did you bring actual food, or a box lunch? #8221;  #8220;Actual food. #8221;  #8220;I'll take whatever your side is. #8221; And yes #8212;it's been a decade and I'm pissed at him, and I'll probably be for awhile, but he still got exactly what I was going for, and I couldn't help giving him a smile anyway. Food is definitely the best option.  #8220;Potato salad. #8221;  #8220;Oh, hell yes. I can't make yours for shit. #8221; I just kind of rolled my eyes at him.  #8220;It's 'cause white people think paprika's a four-letter word, and I never got you out of the habit. I left my lunch in the horror breakroom. I can bring it by when I swing through. Mind if I take the pad on a couple hours' advance? #8221;  #8220;Be my guest. The interest's going to cost you a fork. #8221; I wrote my notes on my way back to Leah, being careful to scribble down in the margins what information I was taking as payment on her behalf for Dale going behind her back. At some point soon I'm going to have to convince her he owed her something for it, but that's tomorrow's problem. For now, I have a written record of the conversation. A few ideas written down, too. Let's hope I'm on the right track. [Part Seven](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g606hl/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is is possible to do a math-based mod in FO4?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-22 03:46:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, I'll explain.  #8203; I am an absolute baby in the modding game--I'm following Gopher's tutorials, as per a suggestion on this sub, but I'm only a couple videos in--so at this point I have more questions than answers. This particular question involves me not knowing if you can even do this with the FO4 engine.  #8203; So in one of my settlements, I have a "hotel." Read: some of it is set up like what *would* be a hotel, if we had the option to actually build those. Especially because it seems absolutely stupid that as large as the Commonwealth is (for a single person on foot), there are only three hotels, and all three are in major metropolitan centers (Bunker Hill, Diamond City, Goodneighbor). Surely there must be an enterprising person or two with an extra bedroll they rent out for weary travelers, especially on the edges of the Commonwealth where folks come in from elsewhere? Actually building this seems simple enough: you designate beds that are "owned," that's that. (I have a mod right now that marks specific beds as "yours" so settlers can't use them.) I can't imagine that's too hard even for a beginner. But it'd be kind of cool if you could *build a hotel,* like, the beds are marked as owned (they don't count toward the total number of beds you need for your settlement), and you have a chance of earning caps for having them in your settlement. I was thinking a 10% chance, per bed, per day in-game, to earn five caps. (Much as you'd pay more for a Hilton on Fifth Avenue than a Motel Six in bumfuck nowhere, I assume these beds would cost less due to being not in a major metropolitan area.) It's not a lot of money, especially in late-game, but it's a fun little immersion thing.  #8203; Now if I wanted to get *really* complicated--which could be fun from a gameplay perspective but probably not at all from a modding one--you could go with "it's a flat 10% chance, but every new service you add to your settlement increases the odds of earning by 2.5% of base value," so like add a trader and it's 12.5%, add a doctor and it's 15%, add a weapons dealer and it's 17.5%, until by the time you've added all six main trades--if I did this math right--it's a 25% chance per bed per day. (After all, a bedroll on some farmer's floor is all well and good, but a thriving small town with some stores to trade in? Now *that's* worth a stop.) And if we wanted to get stupidly intricate, perhaps sleeping bags earn less than floor mattresses, and floor mattresses earn less than proper beds. (I know, I know, at this point I'm overthinking it.)  #8203; These caps would be collected passively through the workshop, just like they are from any vanilla shop.  #8203; Can you actually do math things in this game? Am I too early in my modding skill to give something like this a shot?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need some help troubleshooting a problem with the Conquest mod</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-22 10:26:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so I have the Conquest mod, and I built a frankly gorgeous settlement in Old Gullet Sinkhole. (Legit, I kind of want to live in my own settlement now. I based it on a combination of Montezuma Well and Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater and I'm in love.) Put in crops, water, defenses, beds. So far, so good. Turned on the settlement beacon.  #8203; Got one settler. Tried to assign her to crops. Immediately the game counter showed zero settlers, but still registered as having not enough crops (since "nobody" was assigned to them). Tried to send settlers from other settlements. They never showed up.  #8203; Meanwhile, my game decided to close, so I had to restart. Interestingly, although this settlement is officially named "Lyon Outpost," in my settlements list it shows as Old Gullet Sinkhole. No idea if that's part of the problem or not.  #8203; MOVING ON. I went back to the sinkhole, which now claims I have three settlers. I can't actually see/find any of them, so I built a Vault-Tec population manager . . . which claimed I had no crops I could assign.  #8203; Okay, no sweat, I pulled out my crops and replanted them. The manager tells me I can now assign exactly one person as a farmer. I assign that person . . . and it assigns them to a single stalk of corn, in spite of the fact I have eleven planted. And I still can't find the people. There's not much to do by way of sandboxing yet because the build space is so tiny, but damn, guys, where are you?  #8203; I closed the game, restarted, and opened the manager. This time it said I could assign all three settlers as farmers. Cool! So I did that . . . . and got no crops. I found one of the settlers wandering around and assigned him manually. Nothing--the game gave me the "this resource has been assigned" message, but nothing was actually assigned. Instead my settlers dropped back to zero. I looked at the Conquest page on the Nexus and it says I should be able to get bugfix information from the in-game readme holotape, but guess who doesn't have one of those and can't figure out how to get it?  #8203; This isn't happening in my vanilla settlements. I have a mod installed that turns Fairline Hill Estates into a settlement, too, and that one is also just fine. The problem has to be with Conquest. What do I do?  #8203; I'm going to post this without my mod list just in case there's a quick and dirty "oh yeah, that's known, happens all the time, do this" fix, but if you're reading this with no modlist appended and going " . . . yeah we need the modlist for this," please know I've posted it and immediately started editing to add my list. It's just that it's, um . . . extensive.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Cut-Rate Sherlock Holmes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-22 12:24:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Six](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g5duo4/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; I got a late start to the park today, but I think I've got more to report today than I've had so far. It's a pretty mixed bag, but I've got a direction to go now. I asked Leah if I could borrow her car this morning if I made coffee on the stove, which she's apparently never had. I don't bother with it often #8212;there's a reason we have electric coffeemakers #8212;but I can do it well enough, and she agreed without even thinking twice. She was antsy about getting to the park, but as soon as I said I was planning to get in this afternoon she said she'd take the morning to do laundry and get some cleaning done. I can't say her staying out of the park by choice made me cry any tears, either. I threw something on the stove and made a beeline out. I headed straight for the library as soon as I got out of the apartment, and went right to circulation. You can read all you want without a card, but I need a computer for this. The address on my ID hasn't actually been mine for a decade, but I'm pretty sure Dale isn't going to report me for mail fraud. I spent an hour on the computer, and then way too much time in the  #8220;new age #8221; section, trying to sort mostly-fact from  #8220;oh look, easy money mystical nonsense. #8221; I ended up with three pages of notes and a deep and abiding hatred of legal pads. How Dale can work without being able to move pages at will is beyond me. This is the paper I started with, though, and I traded for it, so I'm going to have to keep it and make it work somehow. Dale insisted on giving me five hundred dollars the day he rehired me. We argued about it until he told me I could take it as a gift or take it as a paycheck advance but either way I was taking it, and finally I gave up. Dale isn't stubborn often, but when he really picks a spot to stand you'd have better luck trying to move Everest. I wasn't going to spend it until I saw how picked-bare Leah's fridge was, and after that, my resolve kind of crumbled. Call me weak if you want, but McDonald's puts whipped cream on their shakes now. I found that out this morning and my biggest regret was not getting a large. Leah was pale when I got back to the apartment. She gave me this awful smile and told me she wasn't sure she could go in. I was ready to throw her in the car and burn rubber all the way to the hospital, but she shook her head.  #8220;I tried that soup you made, #8221; she said.  #8220;I think I'm probably allergic to something that's in it. It burned all the way down. That isn't your fault, though, I didn't even know I had food allergies. I'll be okay. I just need a nap. #8221; I checked the recipe as I was packing up the soup, and nearly kicked myself for not thinking it through. I already know there's a problem. I didn't need to make it worse. Bay leaves, salt, fennel, I'm surprised I didn't kill her. Although her *not* dying on contact is a good thing for a whole bunch of reasons. I got in around three and headed straight for Dale. He was actually in his office this time, feet up on the corner of the desk, on the phone and making faces that suggested he'd rather be out doing something simpler, like training killer bees. I waited until he hung up and threw his head back with the most pitiful groan you can imagine. Think like bear cub caught in a trap here. I dropped the soup on the desk in front of him before the groan could turn into a whine. I've seen him do it before. It's kind of cute, but I don't really have the time for it right now.  #8220;Five minutes of your time. #8221; Dale jumped so hard I was afraid for a minute he might actually land on the floor. Instead he banged his hand on his chair and cussed.  #8220;Jesus! #8221;  #8220;I can see where the confusion comes from, but nah, I'm not him. I would *strongly* recommend not spilling this. #8221; I tapped the soup. Dale looked down at the container, then back at me.  #8220;What are you up to now? #8221;  #8220;More questions. Five minutes. What the *hell* is on your hand? #8221; It looked like he might've stabbed himself with a fork. No wonder he swore when he hit it.  #8220;Warning shot. #8221; He gave me this kind of we-know-this-get-on-with-it look.  #8220;You were saying? #8221;  #8220; . . . maybe this is a bad time. #8221; I wondered how he managed to clean and bandage his hand alone. And what he'd done with the fork.  #8220;Tell you what. You bought five minutes. Ask your questions, I'll tell you if I can answer. #8221; I turned it over in my head for a minute and thought about it.  #8220;Okay. #8221; Dale nodded me to the chair in front of his desk and put the soup on the shelf behind him.  #8220;Shoot. #8221;  #8220;I found Leah's blog online. She wrote about what happened here. The diva and the pianist . . . they were your relatives? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. My granddad's sister and her husband. #8221;  #8220;How long have they been here? As pretenders? #8221; Dale looked off into a corner of the ceiling. It's funny, when you know someone well enough, you can read every tic and expression. You lose some of them after awhile, but not all. Not the most important ones, like *can you believe this* and also *I can't count backward for shit.*  #8220;Since the fifties, I think. #8221;  #8220;And the nurse, Laila, when you were a kid? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; Something about that timeline bugged me, but I bought five minutes, and even though I'm pretty sure Dale wouldn't be counting the seconds . . . it's important. I pulled off my glasses and closed my eyes, hard. I thought of it last night in a dream and didn't write it down when I woke up, like an idiot.  #8220;*The hospital.* Dale, when did St. Macabre's go in? The haunted house? #8221; Dale just gave me this quizzical look.  #8220;In the horror section? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; He shrugged. Then he stopped, and spun his chair around, and went picking through the file cabinet. More fun stuff you learn as the manager's boyfriend: every single attraction in the park has its own file in there. Safety inspections, maintenance notes, original blueprints, the works. Some of the older ones are almost as thick as a novel, but I've seen some of those files, and I'd take the novel over the files any day. Finally he pulled out one of the thinner folders and opened it, flicking through the papers before he stopped in surprise.  #8220;I'll be damned. It didn't go in until 2002. Then what was there before? #8221; He went picking through the cabinet again. I looked at the clock on my phone. What was in the horror section before the haunted hospital was an interesting question #8212;but one for after my time was up.  #8220;So it went in after Laila became the nurse? #8221; Dale stopped his rifling and turned to look at me so slowly I swear I could hear him creaking as he did, like a windup toy.  #8220;A season later. Son of a bitch. #8221;  #8220;Do you approve all the new attractions? Or I mean . . . you, your family, the humans in charge of the park. #8221; Dale looked troubled.  #8220;I think I'd better talk to my dad about his time here before I answer that for sure, Nate. I have, both times rides have changed with me in the chair. But the situation itself's changed, hasn't it? #8221;  #8220;Something like that. #8221; I checked my phone again.  #8220;I'm about out of time. I'll let you get back to work. #8221;I was halfway out the door when something hit me, and I turned around.  #8220;One more question. Not important. I don't think. You don't have to answer. #8221; Dale looked up from the St. Macabre's folder. He was still frowning and looking for information on its predecessor, I guess.  #8220;Yeah? #8221;  #8220;According to Leah's blog, Mr. Scratch and the stagecoach both belonged to your family. The diva and the pianist are direct relations. Laila specifically pissed someone off and got punished. A certain somebody decided to request Leah and me. I can definitely say I was never involved in any supernatural makeout sessions, so okay, he wanted Leah as a . . . a pet, or something, but where do I come into this pattern? #8221;  #8220;I wish like hell I knew what he wanted with Leah, Nate, but really, you have to ask where *you* come in? #8221; Dale raised his eyebrows.  #8220;Whoever or whatever the Wild Ones are, they don't pay too much attention to human marriage laws when they decide what constitutes family. #8221;  #8220;Great, I got more rights from a bunch of evil fairies than I did my own government. #8221; Writing that down sounds like I'm one of those people who's always got the perfect one-liner, but if you'd actually been in the office, you probably would've been able to tell it was something I spit out from sheer shock and just got lucky it was halfway funny. Even if I wasn't currently on the feelings-go-round from hell,  #8220;I'm Nathan, Dale's husband #8221; just sounds bizarre. I found out that's just kind of a thing now when I was in the hospital, but I guess I'm still playing catchup. I'd pay good money to see a sci-fi movie with cryogenics where the frozen people actually deal with culture shock when they wake up.  #8220;What a deal. You don't suppose Leah's secretly a descendant of somebody's bastard kid a few generations back, do you? #8221;  #8220;You know, I'm pretty sure you're joking, but let's renegotiate payment before we go hitting that wasp nest with a stick. #8221; I left the office and went to check on Mr. Scratch. I figured Leah'd like an update, but he perked up when I got close to the cage and then put his head down with a whine as soon as he saw me. I tried giving him some scratches behind the ear anyway, but he wasn't having it. He picked his human, and I'm not her. I wonder if she'll still be his person if she's not human anymore.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I Could Be In Trouble</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-23 12:23:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Seven](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g606hl/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Today was depressing. Oliver agreed I could try my luck with the Aged Diva, and I met him outside the Pianist's restaurant this morning. Sure enough, she was inside, listening to him play, and suddenly I didn't want to disturb them. You get so little time to actually enjoy yourself when you're an unalive entity. I was debating whether I should try anyway, and then I got my own little message from the Wild Ones. They didn't have to be violent about it, either. The Pianist and the Aged Diva both turned their heads, quick and sharp, and stared straight at me. And then the Pianist started to play something different. Every couple I've ever met with an  #8220;our song #8221; has a cutesy story to go with it that sounds half-finished from the outside, and I guess Dale and I aren't any exception. You probably know ours. It's an instrumental, and the huge gag that turned it into  #8220;our song #8221; was us discovering the trailer music for The Two Towers actually originated in Dale's favorite movie. It's the biggest cinematic agreement we've ever had. That's the whole joke, if you're wondering. I told you these stories always sound half-finished from the outside. When I started working at the park, this was the restaurant I worked in. I've heard probably everything the Pianist knows. Most of his songbook is old jazz standards and 1940s swing. You know, the kind of stuff you'd expect in a flashy, high-class Hollywood restaurant. And pretty consistent with Dale's guess on when he ended up stuck here. Lux Aeterna is from 2000. But the Pianist knocked it out in one shot, no hesitation or missed notes or sheet music or anything. And then he and the Diva turned their heads back to a normal position and he launched straight into Night and Day like he hadn't just scared the bejeezus out of me. I apologized to Oliver and told him I thought I'd save the interview for another day, and got out of Hollywood as fast as I could go. I could be totally wrong, but it seems obvious to me: that was a threat. I've asked Dale too much, and I need to stop or face the consequences. Although I have this sinking feeling I wouldn't actually be the one facing them. I decided to head to the horror section, instead. Either I'd catch up with Leah, or I'd introduce myself properly to Darius. Either one seemed like a good option. I found Leah in the last place I expected to #8212;St. Macabre's, checking on the nurse. She jumped and screamed when I tapped her on the shoulder, which, in all fairness, was a pretty stupid move on my part. I'd scream if you sneaked up behind me in St. Macabre's, too. Yeah, even with the effects lighting off. Once she composed herself, she told me Darius was out sick with food poisoning, so she checked in to give him a day off. We headed for Mr. Scratch's cage, and on the way I found myself telling her about the Pianist and the sudden creepy appearance of a very personally significant and totally incongruous piece of music. Leah got this sudden look of despair I'd never seen on her before, not even facing down Warin.  #8220;It's because of me, Nathan. #8221; I haven't seen a smile that sad in my entire life.  #8220;It wouldn't matter so much if you were asking because you and Dale were getting back together. But you're not. #8221; She closed her eyes, and when she opened them again I saw tears standing in them.  #8220;I know what's happening to me. #8221;  #8220;I'm going to find a way to stop it. You did it once, I can too. Especially since you weren't part of the contract. #8221; She shook her head at me. She looked almost frantic, doing it.  #8220;You don't get it, do you? You were the one who got away. They're *pissed* about you, Nathan. They won't let it happen again that easily. It'd take something really drastic to get me out of here. And I don't think any of us have that kind of bargaining chip. Just . . . keep me company, while I still know you? #8221;  #8220;Please, you have a massive DVD collection and a couch. You're stuck with me. #8221; Leah started laughing, the kind of watery laugh you make when you're about to cry.  #8220;Tell Dale I want a *good* shed. And if anybody calls me Indiana Jane because of the whip he has to punch them. #8221; I shook my head right back at her, and then did something I remembered my mother doing, when I was a kid: took her face in both hands to make her look right at me.  #8220;You didn't give up on me. I'm not giving up on you. #8221; She hugged me, and I hugged back. And pretended not to notice when she started soaking through my shirt crying. Mr. Scratch nuzzled up against her, but even that wasn't getting through. I ended up being the one who drove us home. Dale texted to ask if everything was okay when he saw us leaving. I told him I'd call him later, but after I got Leah fed and showered and in bed I ended up texting him instead. *I'm pretty sure I was warned off today.* *Are you calling it quits?* *Not a chance in hell.* *Then stay safe.* I probably shouldn't have sent him anything else, but it was two in the morning and I have yet to see a single good decision made after midnight. *Hey, Dale?* *Yeah?* *Why did you never come?* That was two hours ago. I didn't mean to stay awake so long, but I started looking at my notes and trying to piece together what I know, and when I looked at the clock again and realized he'd never answered me I decided to go to bed. I'm not really tired, but it'll pass the time until daylight again. Maybe I'll go see the Diva tomorrow.

    <TEXT>[Part Eight](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g6lo6w/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not_i/)  #8203; Sorry for the long break between updates, everyone. I didn't see much point in rehashing the same things over and over. I've made two more attempts to talk to the Diva, once about the Pianist and his repertoire #8212;which was a total bust #8212;but once my contacts came in I had an idea and showed up doing the wide-eyed teen girl meeting Justin Timberlake thing. Or I guess now it'd be the wide-eyed teen girl meeting One Direction thing. The pop idols change, the face doesn't. Either way, she loved the vintage hair comb I found online, and I found out she remembers life before being a pretender. I told her I'd had an awful time finding her early work because nobody really recognized how genius she was and asked if she could tell me where to look, and she got out  #8220;why, I sang at fairs to get my start, dearie, with my #8212;my #8212; #8221; before the glitter implosion came. She disappeared for two days after that. I wasn't a fan of doing it, but I finally took a plate of fruit and milk to the central bathroom and left it outside the locked stall as an apology. She was back the next morning like nothing ever happened. Oliver told me she didn't seem to remember the conversation at all, but she still had the hair comb. I'm glad for that, at least. I think I put her through an awful lot of trouble. Dale and I haven't talked outside manager-and-employee interactions. Caroline told me the other day she gets now why I thought he was cute, though, and I guess he's started putting in an effort to look like a human being again. Part of me is glad #8212;I've been the person with no shower and no shaving and it makes you feel like garbage. On the other hand, I know he's doing it because I'm here, and I'm not sure I want to be responsible for whether he's taking care of himself. And finally, Leah. The transformation seems to have stalled out. I'm not sure if we've reached the end of what Warin did to her, or if it's just taking awhile to reach the next step. Either way, she's been pretty cheerful the last couple of days for reasons that seem to be completely related to being able to still get out and do things. We went out for lunch yesterday with the whole acting crew. They gave me a walkie-talkie and a flask. The flask confused me until Oliver pointed out I'm going to be out in the sun for hours at a time in jeans and leather and long sleeves, and I can fit an entire bottle of Gatorade in there. He kind of looks like one of the Dapper Dans from Disney World when he's in costume, and he said even though his outfit is pretty light he still has to duck into the restaurant kitchens for water a lot. I suggested to Leah we get her one and she told me she keeps a couple of bottles in the breakroom. The horror section is the smallest one, so it's not hard for her to step in from time to time.Fair enough, I guess, but I'm still going to get her one. It's less about the drink and more about the reminder to do it. Today was pretty cool, though, except for one thing I'll get to later. The park opened to the general public today, so I was out in full costume for the first time #8212;chaps and fake revolver and everything. Dale unearthed the rules for being a pretenderless actor, probably from Laila's old file. They're pretty simple: pick a character name and answer to it while in the presence of parkgoers, always stay in character when you're onstage, hand-to-hand contact with parkgoers #8212;like handshakes and high-fives #8212;is okay but any other contact is strictly forbidden. The park doesn't open til noon, so we get dinner, not lunch. It starts at four and runs through seven, and you get an hour but you can never have both actors from a single section offstage at the same time. I'm Martin Eastwood, but you can call me Marty. Oliver seems to be the only one who caught the reference when I shared my new alias this morning, but when he did he laughed so hard Sprite came out his nose. We spent a minute swapping favorite quotes back and forth, to everyone else's confusion, and then we did a last-minute go-over on the opening day gameplan, and then we all split up to go to our respective sections. I spent most of my morning hanging out with little kids and taking pictures, and being pissed at Warin for a reason completely unrelated to me ending up on the stagecoach: he got to do this for *years,* the bastard, and I bet he never even properly enjoyed it. I also got one very scandalized mother asking if I was drinking liquor on Main Street when I pulled out my flask. It was actually cherry Gatorade, but I told her it was sarsaparilla and I would *never* be so crass. I'm not sure what offended her more, the answer or me staying movie-polite while giving it. You can't win them all, I guess. Dinner was 4:30 for me today, but I ended up not really eating it. I brought in enough lasagna for everyone to have a hot lunch, and most of the breakrooms have microwaves, but I was only four bites into mine when the walkie-talkie decided to yell  #8220;I need help in Candyland, now, *please* #8221; in Maxine's way-too-panicked voice. I was mostly out of costume #8212;I didn't bother changing out of the flannel shirt or the jeans, but the vest and chaps and stuff are a pain to sit in and I didn't want to spill on them, so I stripped down to basics when I got in for dinner #8212;so I didn't have to worry about being in character when I sprinted out and headed straight for Candyland, doing a mental checklist as I went. Candyland is off-limits to Darius because of his costume, Mitchell couldn't leave the stagecoach without going all the way to the back of the park, Leah would have to put up Mr. Scratch before she could even think about leaving horror, and whether or not Anne was free depended entirely on what the Mime was up to. Oliver and I, probably by virtue of being the only two able to run, got to Candyland first, almost crashing into Dale and Madeleine at the entrance. Anne was soothing a little girl having a complete meltdown. Her mother was livid. Dale headed straight for the girl and her mom and Oliver and I went hunting for Maxine. It didn't take long to find her, starfished around the Sugar Plum Fairy behind the stage. It was like watching someone have a whole-body fight with a pair of cats. Oliver caught my eye.  #8220;Count of three? #8221;  #8220;Sounds good. #8221; We counted, and grabbed the Fairy's arms. I don't know how gentle Oliver was being, but I didn't bother a bit. Her entire face was out. No wonder that poor kid was having a fit. Maxine rolled over twice until she could find her feet under her hoop skirts, and stood up.  #8220;Trailer, #8221; she gasped, and sort of waved in the direction I assumed we'd need to go.  #8220;She needs put in. #8221; We marched the Fairy to the trailer and locked her in. There were a few random thumping noises, and then silence. She'd probably started dancing again. Maxine had a hell of a cut on her arm, probably from the Fairy's beak. I told Oliver to go ahead and head back to Hollywood, and I headed for the front entrance with Maxine, who was trying not to bleed on her dress. The family I'd seen on my way in was missing, but I could see the light on in Dale's office. We headed that way just in time to see the mom leading her little girl out. I grabbed Dale's door before it could swing shut and pushed Maxine inside.  #8220;Is she going to be okay? #8221; He didn't have to ask what I was talking about. At this point Maxine had given up on the dress and was using a layer from beneath the tulle to try and stop the bleeding. Dale got up and pulled the dress away from her arm so delicately you'd think he was a surgeon, not a park manager. Maxine gave me this kind of gobsmacked look over his shoulder that would've been funny if I wasn't worried about her health and humanity. None of the others, except Leah, have gotten to see Dale in not-a-manager mode before.  #8220;Did you see spit? #8221;  #8220;No, but I wasn't really looking. That little girl grabbed her tutu and she lost it. I just tried to get her out of arm's reach before the kid could get hurt. She's so little. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, she's four, #8221; Dale agreed, still looking at Maxine's arm.  #8220;Her mom thinks it was a malfunctioning animatronic. Fairy's put away right now? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; He looked up at me.  #8220;I'm pretty sure she's going to need stitches. Can you take her? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, but I don't have a car. #8221; Dale snagged his keys from a hook off the wall and handed them to me.  #8220;Black truck, end of the first row. There should be a blanket in there you can use on her arm. #8221; There was. There was also a stick shift, and I wanted to beat my head on the wheel because Dale is the one who taught me to drive stick and I didn't have that long to learn before I ended up driving a pair of reins instead, but at least I had some idea what I was doing, and honestly I should've expected it. I'm pretty sure Dale's never owned anything with an automatic transmission in his life. Anyway, I got Maxine to the hospital and only stalled out once on the way, and the ER staff #8212;after we got it straightened out that I'm her coworker, not her brother, but Maxine was still okay with me being in her room #8212;bought the story about the electronic puppet gone wrong. Maxine ended up with thirteen stitches. She normally rides in with Caroline or one of the other guys, so I dropped her at home and told her to get some rest. She said she'd throw the dress in some cold water and see if she couldn't get the blood out before bed. I told her I thought she was crazy, but she just kind of started laughing. All of us have three costumes #8212;the idea is one in the wash, one you're wearing today, and one you'll wear tomorrow #8212;but I guess she's got a point, the princess dress would be pretty annoying to try to replace. I didn't get back to the park until after sunset #8212;close to closing. Dale met me in the parking lot and told me Maxine would be fine; he'd already heard from upper management. I wanted to hug him until that exhausted look got out of his eyes, but I didn't. That's a dangerous road I'm not ready to travel down. So that was the first day back at the park. Leah heated up some leftovers when we got home so I could have actual food. I'm about ready to sack out, but I figured I'd update you guys. Hopefully tomorrow is less eventful.

    <TITLE>I'm the one who asked for help troubleshooting Conquest. Update for you all</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-25 01:10:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I tried dissolving the settlement and re-settling under a new name. Didn't help. After that, I tried loading a save from before I made the settlement, and threw down some beds and mutfruit on the logic of "I refuse to spend five hours building a nonfunctional settlement again."  #8203; I got one settler. I was able to assign her to crops, but only one plant at a time (I could increase how many she tended, but I still had to assign each individually), and I had to manually assign her to a bed.  #8203; . . . at which point it occurred to me, I think this *entire mod installation* might be borked. I had a settlement at Jalbert Brothers that I hadn't completely finished putting in (no attempt to attract settlers yet) and it fell victim to the "the workshop has vanished, everything you built is here and supposedly so is the settlement but there is no workshop and attempts to open it just toggle you into third-person" glitch, and for some weird reason I had a settlement *at Hangman's Alley.* Literally I died, the game respawned me at my last save point (Hangman's), and when it did it said "you can now build at Garwood Outpost" which was right on top of Hangman's. No workshop I could find to delete Garwood, either, and of course the actual mechanics of Conquest mean such a settlement should be completely impossible.  #8203; So I've deleted the entire mod and I'm doing a fresh install from the Nexus instead of Bethnet. If that doesn't work, I may have to bid a sad farewell to the idea of custom settlements, but I hope not.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Just Perplexed (Part Ten)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-25 10:45:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Nine](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g76ndf/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) There was a letter waiting for me in the breakroom today when I got in. It was from Dale, of course, and #8212;surprisingly #8212;handwritten. Dale's always been embarrassed about his handwriting; his printing is the kind of utilitarian blocks and slashes you see a lot on stuff like order manifests, and his cursive is just straight-up illegible. I tried teaching him the same script my grandmother taught me, but he never got it. The entire time we were together he did everything he could to get around writing things down #8212;recording cassette tapes, typing letters, texting me a grocery list instead of leaving it in my car #8212;to the point that if he had to handwrite something for business, he'd ask if I could transcribe it for him. I wondered, while I was unfolding the paper, what he did for handwritten business after I was gone. He started off with *I still don't know how to give you the explanation you deserve*, and then, well . . . he tried. He told Leah I wouldn't understand, and he managed to pull off giving me too much credit and not enough at the same time. I think I get why he decided poisoning me was the only way out, now; the other options were saying no and letting Warin pick off dozens if not hundreds of people, one at a time, by slow torture, or saying yes and turning me over to the Wild Ones. Instead I got one last quiet moment with somebody I loved before it all went to hell. It was the best of a whole slew of bad options, I guess I can get that. But he lost me at his family #8212;he spent half a page trying to explain to me what it means to lose a family that actually gives a shit about you, and he probably would've had better luck trying to explain color to a blind person. And he still didn't tell me why he never so much as stopped by to say hello. I don't know if he's ducking the question or hasn't figured out how to put it in words. I was still sitting at the breakroom table when Mitchell came in and pushed a totally different envelope in front of me.  #8220;Hey, it's payday, #8221; he said, and I jumped, because there's no way he should've been able to get up behind me that quietly.  #8220;Dale asked if I'd bring yours down. He's gotta leave early today. #8221;  #8220;I bet. #8221; I guess if I wrote four pages about something I called the worst day of my life, I wouldn't want to hang around for another twelve hours to talk about it either.  #8220;Hey, Oliver said there's a freezer somewhere on the grounds we're allowed to use. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, it's in Hollywood. The ice cream parlor has this thing that looks like a fridge but it's actually a freezer. The bottom shelf is ours. #8221;  #8220;Hell yeah, I'm gonna bring a cheesecake tomorrow. #8221; I grabbed my cowboy vest to shrug it on, and Mitchell kind of gave me this sideways grin.  #8220;The fuck were you planning to do with the rest of your life, Nathan, be a chef? #8221;  #8220;Nah. My dad wanted me to go into the family business, but I wanted to be a kindergarten teacher. #8221; Mitchell stopped halfway through putting on his bolo tie.  #8220;Yeah? What's the family business? #8221;  #8220;Being a Baptist preacher. #8221; Apparently I get to be the funny one on crew now, because Mitchell started laughing so hard he had to sit down.  #8220;And here #8212;here #8212;oh, *fuck*, #8221; he said, but he was kind of wheezing, like the words and the laughing were both trying to cram out one tiny door and neither one could fit all the way.  #8220;Here you fuckin' are. #8221;  #8220;And here I fuckin' am. Wearing a cowboy hat and being told I look like Dul #233; Hill by a bunch of people who can't remember his actual name. #8221; Mitchell kind of gave me this *look.*  #8220;Man, you look *way* too young to be Dul #233; Hill. #8221;  #8220;The guy from Holes? #8221;  #8220;The guy from Suits. Probably the same guy, huh? #8221; I just shrugged #8212;I've never heard of Suits, but there can't be that many Dul #233; Hills in Hollywood #8212;and finished adjusting my belt. One thing nobody ever tells you about those old Westerns, carrying a gun (even a fake one) and a flask and a coin bag gets damned heavy. It's enough to make me want to throw suspenders on under the vest. I should probably tell you a little about how Twin Vale is set up, if you really want to get a feel for it. There are five streets in Twin Vale: Main, First, Second, Gold, and Union. Main, First, and Union all cross right in the middle of Twin Vale, like an asterisk. Second is this little alley off the far end of Main, where the stagecoach meadow and the breakroom are. It's also what you might call backstage #8212;you'll find maintenance equipment back there, sometimes some out of service ride pieces or furniture, that kind of thing. Gold is just a ring that runs from the end of Second out around the edge of Twin Vale. It's mostly just a place to get the horses turned around so you can come back down a different road, if you're on the coach. There are a few rides, all from close to the park's opening #8212;a wooden roller coaster, a newer (but still pretty old) and smaller version of the carousel in Candyland #8212;but the main draw down here is stuff like photo booths and, of course, the saloons. They're both actually restaurants, but with the exception of the Pianist's restaurant, they're also the only place in the park to get alcohol. I like the smaller one, on Union, because they make really good barbecue and sometimes if I can get there right at closing they've got leftovers, but the bigger one is a great place to hang out and look for kids because it's at the foot of Main right where the three streets meet. Mostly, I need you to understand how *big* Twin Vale is. Hollywood is bigger, but not by much. It honestly kind of surprises me sometimes there aren't more actors down here. Why do I need you to get this? Because you need to understand why I was ready to just cram my chicken in my face and nap for my entire break by the time it came around at six. I actually did exactly that, and when I woke up it was because a very small set of fingers was poking my face. I almost swore, and then tried to swear in cowboy because why a child would be in the breakroom was beyond me but *stay in character*, and then I realized it was Madeleine.  #8220;Hey, kiddo, what's up? #8221; Madeleine just kind of gave me this sad little shake of her head. Taking over Warin's job meant giving up her voice, and she seems pretty okay with signing and pantomiming most of the time, but it's also pretty easy to tell when she's frustrated by things she just can't get across.  #8220;Can you show me? #8221; She pointed at my phone, and I unlocked it before handing it to her. She opened my photos and started scrolling. There's not much in there, and most of it is reaction images, but she found what she was looking for and passed my phone back, tapping the screen aggressively.  #8220;Leah? #8221; She nodded.  #8220;Is she okay? Like right-now okay, not . . . you know, in general? #8221; She nodded again.  #8220;Is this about her . . . turning? #8221; Another nod. Then she reached into my lunch bag, found a peach I hadn't eaten yet, pointed at my phone, and threw the peach into the trash with more force than any kid her age should be able to muster. Then she pointed at the phone again, did this kind of dramatic pirouette, grabbed her ears, pulled them down, and fell over. Guessing games like this aren't nearly as entertaining as TV makes them out to be.  #8220;Okay, so . . . no fruit for Leah . . . .  #8221; Madeleine sat up and nodded.  #8220;Because it'll kill her? #8221; She shook her head and grabbed her ears again. Then her whiskers, and then the sides of her face, shaking her head back and forth.  #8220;She'll turn into an animal? #8221; I could see her getting ready to give up; *close enough*, basically. I ran back over her charades.  #8220;It'll make her turn into a pretender more quickly. #8221; More nodding, so frantic I was afraid she'd give herself a headache.  #8220;She barely eats fruit to start with, I think it'll be fine #8212; #8221; Frantic head-shaking. She scissored her hands back and forth #8212;*no way, nope, no, no.*  #8220;No eating fruit at all? #8221; More nodding. Then she looked at the clock on the breakroom wall and covered her nose with both hands. I followed her line of sight and said something I really shouldn't have said in front of a six-year-old. Seven-ten. I overshot my break. Madeleine pushed me out the door. My chaps were still inside, but I didn't exactly have time to go back, and I had the hat and belt, so I was recognizable enough. I booked it down to Main to see if I could find Mitchell. Sunset wasn't until after eight today, but sometimes it's good to get the horses in early #8212;they go a little nuts even before it's time for them to go up for the night, once in awhile. As luck would have it, he'd actually tied the coach outside the smaller saloon. It's called Jack's Place, and if you're onstage but really need something to drink it's out-of-the-way enough to grab a pop or some water without being bombarded, which is exactly what Mitchell was doing. I sat down next to him and asked for a root beer old-fashioned, which is actually just a root beer in a cocktail glass about half the size of a regular pop glass. Helps to keep from wasting too much time at the bar. I told him what Madeleine told me, and he just kind of shook his head when I asked if he'd ever heard of anything like it before.  #8220;But man, if she's warning you about it, I think you might want to put a lock on the fridge. Otherwise why wouldn't she just tell Leah herself? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. Gonna have to get the fruit out of the apartment altogether, I think. #8221; I took a big swig of root beer. I don't know what brand is actually served on the grounds, but I guarantee it's not whatever Coke or Pepsi pass off as root beer.  #8220;Am I supposed to tell her, though? Like am I supposed to keep this a secret? Is it supposed to *tell* me something? I'm lost. #8221; Mitchell just shook his head again. Then he stood up.  #8220;Keep me posted, but I've got to get the horses put up before they go psycho, 'kay? #8221;  #8220;I will, #8221; I told him, and I finished up my root beer and followed him out. I was most of the way back to the main plaza when it hit me, this poem out of one of Dale's books that I read years ago, about a girl who ate fruit she bought from goblins. I picked up all the fruit in Leah's fridge at the same grocery store where I stocked the rest of her cupboard, but who knows where it started before that? And sure, I paid for it with the last of Dale's gift, money actually changed hands, but if somebody wanted to claim the price wasn't fair . . . I don't think I'm going to put strawberries on that cheesecake. [Part Eleven](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g8ecz0/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Menace, Apparently [Part Eleven]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-26 13:29:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Ten](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g7rkat/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Work was canceled today. I got the call from Dale around 7:30. Normally the park stays open if the weather's questionable, because in this part of the world if you don't like the weather you wait five minutes, but the forecast today was severe thunderstorms and flash floods from three in the morning all the way through to midnight. Even if it lets up later in the day, nobody's going to go out, and there's going to be maintenance at the park. Gary's going to have his hands full with downed trees, probably. Hopefully it's only trees, and not power lines. Dale hates thunderstorms, but I love them. My only problem is they make me want to do everything, all at once, and there's only so much you can do when the whole world is putting on a Vegas-worthy light display, so by the time I was done making way too many freezable meals and helping Leah mop and vacuum and running my stuff down to the laundry room and back up again, Leah was ready for a nap and I was ready to crawl the walls out of sheer boredom. I told you. Thunderstorms are like that. Even after spending ten years with nothing between me and the rain but a lean-to big enough for the stagecoach and not much else, thunderstorms are like that. I finally ended up texting Oliver and harassing him into playing Words With Friends when the power went out and I couldn't watch any more Iron Chef. Challenging him might have been the most entertaining mistake of my life. I had no idea he was an English major. Also, I know what  #8220;ubiquitous #8221; means now. And Oliver knows coriander and cilantro are the same thing unless you're in the US, so I guess we both learned something. The power came back on, but the TV said it couldn't connect to wifi #8212;and honestly I'd really like to know when somebody decided televisions needed to connect to the internet #8212;so I was going to try to take a nap myself when my phone chimed. It was Dale, who wanted to know if we could get coffee. *As friends,* he specified. *Or coworkers, if you like that better.* I thought we'd go to Denny's or something, but we ended up at Starbucks. There was a covered porch, and the lightning was settled enough to sit outside without a deathwish, so we did. I was afraid it was going to be an hour of awkward silence and trying to pretend everything was totally normal, but instead we sat for a little while watching the rain in that kind of quiet where you don't really need to say anything. Then the lightning flashed again, so bright the entire sky went white and the world turned into the inside of a drum, and I started laughing and Dale swore and almost fell off his chair.  #8220;That was cool. #8221;  #8220;You're a menace, Nate. #8221;  #8220;That's me, spreading food and chaos everywhere I go. I've got a peach crisp in the car for you, by the way. I made it night before last and then Madeleine told me I couldn't let Leah eat fruit and I didn't want to waste it. #8221; Dale looked grim.  #8220;I can't tell you why, but she's right. #8221; I sort of shrugged at him.  #8220;I mean, it's a huge thing in folklore, isn't it? Don't eat fae food? Especially if you think you're bewitched? I don't know what makes all fruit fae food, but that's kind of #8212; #8221; Dale shook his head.  #8220;It's safe for you to eat. Just not her. And I can't tell you anything more than that. #8221;  #8220;I don't want you to tell me anything more than that. #8221; I didn't plan to tell him about the Pianist, but it kind of spilled out anyway. Trying to keep it to myself was stupid, anyway. I've never been able to keep secrets. Not from Dale, anyway. He shook his head at me again, but this time more like he was disappointed. No #8212;not disappointed. That little not-a-smile he gave me when he told me to drive the stagecoach was back.  #8220;I think it's probably a good thing for the fate of the entire world we don't need you to be some CIA secret agent, what's his face. James Bond. #8221;  #8220;Fuck James Bond, I want to be a Bond boy. All I'd have to do is wear tight pants and shoot things and take long showers and have sex with Daniel Craig. I could live with that. If I survived to the end of the movie, anyway. #8221; I was trying for just a little sarcastic, hoping he'd laugh, but he didn't. There's only so far gallows humor can take you when it comes to lightening the mood.  #8220;I see Leah's been indulging your total lack of taste. #8221; He sighed.  #8220;I'm sure they're watching you as closely as they watch me. Leah really caught them by surprise. And I'm not sure they totally understand what's going on with us right now #8212; #8221;  #8220;Forget the Wild Ones, *I* don't totally understand what's going on with us right now. #8221; Dale kind of waved his hand #8212;the kind of wave you only get when you've known someone long enough to tell the difference between acknowledgment and dismissal.  #8220;But they know . . . . they know I still care about you. And they know you're a threat. They wanted Leah dead. She might be turning because of an overstepped contract, but they're not going to let her go that easily. Actually, I think they might go well beyond their normal efforts to keep her. #8221; He paused.  #8220;That, I can tell you. It's not really anything you don't already know. #8221;  #8220;I don't want any information here. I just want an opinion. #8221; I waited until he looked right at me #8212;I knew I had his attention already, but I wanted to see it.  #8220;Do you think it's too late for me to help her? Don't say you don't know. Just tell me what your gut says. #8221; Dale leaned back in his chair. He looked like he was sifting things over in his head.  #8220;I *don't* know, Nate, that's the thing. This is all new. Nobody's ever tried it in the entire history of the contract. Not as far as I know, at least. I'm not even sure how I've been able to talk to you all as much as I have. Because Leah already shared the contract with you all, I guess. I think if you forced me to say yes or no I'd lean maybe-to-yes. But I'd also say if I know anyone who can find their way to a win from what should've been an unwinnable situation, it's you. #8221; I just kind of nodded and played with my straw. He's right, the odds are so high I should just try winning the lottery instead, but even though I wanted him to be honest with me I didn't *really* want him to be honest, if that makes any sense. We sat for a little longer, and then the rain started really coming down again. Dale looked at Leah's car and kind of raised his eyebrows at me. I shrugged. I was hoping to get to the library again, but not with rain so heavy the windshield wipers would be a formality.  #8220;Mind if I follow you home? #8221;  #8220;Oh, you're a *polite* stalker, #8221; I said, and this time he did laugh. He actually snorted so hard I thought he'd choke on his drink, but he coughed once or twice and got back on top of it.  #8220;No offense to Leah's car, but if you hit anything even approaching a puddle you're not going to make it. The body on that thing is way too low for this weather. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, not my smartest decision ever. #8221; I thought about it for a minute.  #8220;You can make sure I get back okay. I don't mind. #8221; Leah was watching Hell's Kitchen when I got back. I think it was Hell's Kitchen. Might have been Kitchen Nightmares. Something with Gordon Ramsay screaming at people, anyway.  #8220;Good date? #8221;  #8220;It wasn't a date, but nice try. #8221; She gave me this kind of somber look.  #8220;Learn anything? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, Dale's a vampire stalker. He'll follow you everywhere but you have to invite him first. #8221; Leah laughed until she turned red in the face. I waited until she got down to giggles before making the *yeah?* face at her.  #8220;Sorry, I just #8212; #8221; She put her palms at the bottom of her neck, fanning her hands up the side of her face.  #8220;I imagined him in the *collar* #8212; #8221; And then she was off again. It is pretty funny, I've got to give her that one. But more importantly, it distracted her. I didn't want to have to dance around him telling me it might be too late. Tomorrow I have to ask Madeleine about the fruit again, if the weather lets up. I'll let you all know.

    <TEXT>The new chapter is coming in a bit, but first, a quick announcement.  #8203; I outline chapters on my break at work, and actually write them when I get home at 1am. This normally isn't a problem for me because I do the same things day-to-day, but this Thursday, I'll be livestreaming a reading of Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett to raise money for the WHO for COVID-19 relief.  #8203; That means I have to be in bed *way* earlier than usual, so there won't be a chapter on Wednesday night. (Depending on how well the fundraising goes, there also might not be a chapter on Thursday night. If we reach the fundraising goal, I'll be working my way through 400 pages, aloud, with voices, and I have *no* idea how long that'll take.)  #8203; Thanks to all of you for indulging my "yeah, but I need a happier ending" ridonkulousness. You'll have two more chapters to tide you--and then, just a small break.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Horse Thief, Apparently [Part Twelve]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-27 13:04:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Eleven](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g8ecz0/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) Sometimes the stuff that happens in this job is so intense without the Wild Ones even having to get involved, I have to wonder how the people at Disney do it. Today started off with another one of Dale's weird, cryptic texts to the entire crew. *Early call. 10am. New post discussions.* I'd love to tell you he knows how to communicate like a normal human being and he's just really terse in work texts, but after our first date he just sent me *Tuesday?* like I was supposed to know he was asking if I had time for lunch. Anyway, Leah and I showed up at a quarter to ten, Leah puzzled and me trying not to throw up. The last time I heard  #8220;new position #8221; . . . well, you know how that ended. We all gathered in the Pianist's restaurant. I was waiting for him to wig out again, but he didn't. I caught Oliver's eye, and he nodded a little, so while we waited for Dale I headed for the piano. #8220;Hey, do you take requests? #8221; The Pianist raised his eyebrows at me. I took it as a yes.  #8220;Could you play Lux Aeterna? #8221; He frowned that kind of slightly-disturbed smile really rich people use to say *you're a fucking idiot.*  #8220;I'm afraid I'm not familiar. #8221; I glanced over at Oliver and shrugged a little. He shrugged back.  #8220;Never mind, then. Thank you. #8221; I dropped a buck into his jar. I have no idea where that money goes, but it seemed rude not to, and anyway, he gave me information. I had to pay him for it. And then Dale finally walked in, five minutes late, and dropped a bag on our table with a loud *clunk.*  #8220;So let's be clear, nobody is on the streets at all between one and four, unless there's an emergency. You can stay in later if you think you need to. Leah, Nathan, Mitchell, especially you three. Most of you can trust your judgment on whether the pretenders go away while you're indoors, but Scratch and the mime have to. Might not even be worth letting the mime out until four. Everywhere on the grounds that sells beverages knows if any of you show up and ask for something between four and six they should give you soda water #8212;the hell are you all looking at me that way for? #8221; He glanced at me, and I guess he realized he didn't make any more sense to me than he did to anyone else, because he let out this long-suffering sigh.  #8220;Am I the only person here who watches the weather report? #8221;  #8220;Probably, #8221; Darius told him.  #8220;I never bother, it's always wrong anyway. #8221;  #8220;Jesus *Christ!* #8221; Mitchell, insightful as always, staring at his phone like he thought it was going to bite him.  #8220;A hundred and *three?* #8221;  #8220;Mine says a hundred and five, #8221; Anne commented, looking like a little kid who just lost her ice cream on the sidewalk.  #8220;All week? When do we *ever* get weather like this? #8221;  #8220;It happened my sophomore year, #8221; I told them.  #8220;The week we were supposed to run the mile. Half of us faked sick just to get out of it. Coach was a Marine, he didn't give a *shit* if it was 98 degrees. #8221;  #8220;So we're just . . . not going to be outside? What about parkgoers? #8221; Leah gave Dale this look like she might nail him to the wall with eye-daggers alone.  #8220;You're going to let them in? #8221;  #8220;There'll be a heat advisory posted, and people can choose to visit indoor attractions. Or to not come. But you eight are usually supposed to be outside, all the time. If you're indoors it keeps you safe and it encourages other people to be inside, too. So you're getting indoor posts for the hottest part of the day. #8221; He pointed around to each of us in turn.  #8220;Oliver, you'll be here. Caroline, same for you. Encourage the Diva to stay in here, but if she wanders off, let her go. Darius, St. Macabre's. Anne, you'll be in Fezziwig's. #8221; I didn't even know where I was going yet, and I was already jealous. Fezziwig's is a soda fountain. It's been there at least since the forties, and it's barely changed. There's still a soda jerker and everything.  #8220;Mitchell, you're going to be at Jack's Place. Nathan, you'll be in Doc and Kitty's. #8221;  #8220;Oh, come on, why does he get to go to Jack's? #8221; Whining isn't my prettiest personality trait, I know, but Doc and Kitty's *sucks.* It's the bigger of the two saloons, often standing room only, and if you're going to run into somebody in Twin Vale who wants to be a problem, Doc and Kitty's is where you'll find them. It's not really a saloon, or even a Western-themed restaurant #8212;it's more like a hipster's idea of what a saloon-themed restaurant should be. Jack's is the small one with good barbecue and a bartender who actually knows how to do some of the cool tricks you see in movies. The bad thing about Dale being my kind-of-boyfriend is, he's had plenty of time to grow an immunity.  #8220;Because for some unknown reason, people keep telling me you're *charming,* and Doc and Kitty's is just off the main plaza. #8221;  #8220;Just stick me in a sandwich board, why don't you. #8221; I thought I mumbled it, but apparently it was loud enough, because he shot right back at me.  #8220;Don't tempt me. Leah, you're in the arcade. You can move between the coffee shop and the games, but don't head into the ride section. Maxine, you'll be offstage. There's nowhere I can put you that's public-facing indoors and also within easy reach of the Fairy. That means your break is early this week. I expect all of you to be carrying something to drink. #8221; He tipped over his bag, and I watched a series of bottles roll across the table: Gatorade, Smartwater, Pedialyte.  #8220;If you pass out because of heat or dehydration, you had all the tools to keep yourself safe and didn't use them and I don't feel sorry for you. #8221;  #8220;Dibs on mango! #8221; Oliver yelled, and when we were done swarming the drinks Dale rolled his eyes at us all and shooed us off to get dressed. I was kind of hoping the heat would hold off long enough I could stay out of Doc and Kitty's until two, but Dale apparently had an eagle eye on that forecast; we went onstage at noon and by twelve-thirty I was sweating through my shirt. I ended up heading in early, instead. Most weekdays this early in the season are young adults who either want to be ten again and come off as totally delightful, or adults of various ages who, for some reason, come to an amusement park in spite of hating joy. I was expecting Doc and Kitty's to be full of the second kind, but instead when I sauntered in #8212;I won't lie, I did the batwing-door thing and everything #8212;there was just one group of six girls, apparently having a party because one of them had just gotten her first apartment. They waved me over as soon as they spotted me. Sometimes fun adults are even better than the little kids, because you can't say  #8220;you're moving *all* of these fine young ladies into your, uh, new property, ma'am? #8221; to a five-year-old, and even if you could the reaction would be really underwhelming. They insisted on getting me a drink, so I asked them to get me a house highball. Fun fact you might not know #8212;if you're at a bar, don't bother going up to the bartender and asking for a house special. Whatever you get isn't going to have any alcohol in it. It's a drink they hold in reserve specifically for employees who can't say no without upsetting a patron. I served my fair share of them when I was working in Casablanca Nights #8212;that's the Pianist's restaurant, by the way #8212;and the house highball is pretty good. It's simple syrup, pineapple juice, and soda water, but when you add the word  #8220;house #8221; in the park you also get a couple of drops of food coloring so it looks like it's actually whiskey, or champagne, or whatever kind of drink the glass type works with. This is where I started realizing my backstory was absolute shit. If I'd realized I was going to need to entertain an entire group of giggly, flirty twentysomethings by myself, in character, I would've done a better job putting it together. Finally I sneaked into my  #8220;wallet #8221; #8212;by which I mean one of those leather bags you see on men's belts in the better class of Western movies #8212;and found my phone, and did what I hoped was sending Mitchell a text: *help me!* Maybe Dale isn't the only one with bad texting skills, actually. Anyway, Mitchell showed up in about ten minutes flat, which isn't bad for running across two-thirds of Twin Vale. Everybody in the bar shot up to look at him, because he wasn't exactly quiet about coming in, and while heads were turned I made a *get me out of here* face at him and kind of gestured at the table. I had no idea how he was supposed to do it, but I knew I was going to blow character if I stayed.  #8220;Martin Eastwood, #8221; Mitchell said, and put a hand on his prop gun.  #8220;You're under arrest, under the authority given to me by law. #8221; I had no idea how to pull off a Jack Sparrow grin, but I gave it a shot anyway.  #8220;Sheriff. And as you can see I haven't done a thing but keep company with these lovely ladies. #8221;  #8220;Eastwood, you're wanted everywhere from here to Tombstone. Embezzlement, horse theft, holding up a mail coach, hunting on Sioux land, breach of promise, and I don't even know what else. Now are you going to come quietly, or am I going to have to advise these poor women to take shelter? #8221; I got up from the table, took off my hat, and gave a big sweeping bow.  #8220;Ladies, #8221; I said, and let him cuff me and walk me out.  #8220;*Thank* you, #8221; I muttered at him as we got onto the porch.  #8220;Fucking *Dale*. He didn't tell me we had to *talk.* #8221; Mitchell snorted. Then he steered me between Doc and Kitty's and the gift shop next door and sprang the cuffs. There's a pair of cellar doors near the front of the gift shop that I always thought were ornamental, but it turns out they really do lead somewhere. The room underneath was empty except for a bunch of shelves, but it was cool, and more importantly it was away from the housewarming party.  #8220;We should do that again, #8221; I told him.  #8220;Just kind of lure Dale up here and stage the shootout at the O.K. Corral. #8221;  #8220;Hey, maybe you can get away with that, but he'd murder me if I dragged him all the way up here, #8221; Mitchell commented.  #8220;Was kinda fun, though. Maybe we could put together a stagecoach robbery. Stage it a couple times a week. We've got all the parts. #8221;  #8220;*Now* you're talking. I wonder if he'd go for it. #8221;  #8220;Are you kidding me? Dale won't care. Until all the shit went down with Leah we all kind of assumed Dale didn't care about *anything.* He likes to make himself out to be the nastiest bastard on the face of the planet. #8221;  #8220;That's hilarious. He made me watch Million Dollar Baby and cried through most of it. #8221; I chugged half my flask in one go. It's weird, even when you're out of the heat it makes you thirstier.  #8220;If he pulls it off that well, *he* should be an actor. Make him chase the damn Sugar Plum Fairy. #8221; We stayed in the cellar for about fifteen minutes #8212;basically long enough for the girls in the saloon to get distracted by something else #8212;and then Mitchell headed back to Jack's and I sent Dale a text to let him know I needed to relocate, and why. He thought me getting arrested for breach of promise was *hilarious.* Apparently it's an old-timey charge for getting engaged, knocking the girl up, and then running off. Anyway, he sent me over to the leather shop, which is actually a gift shop, but there's an actual leathersmith who works there, which is pretty cool. The first time I worked here I was saving up for a pair of leather boots when, well, you know. They're expensive, but worth it. I figured even if there weren't too many people in yet #8212;which was how the day seemed to be shaping up, the heat and it being a weekday conspiring to keep people away #8212;I could always watch the smith. And I did, but the whole time I kept having this weird feeling about that room Mitchell took me to. I was sure I knew everything about Twin Vale. Even Dale said it: I know Twin Vale better than anyone else here. I would have sworn the area under those doors was just a concrete slab. I never even saw Warin come out of there. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to go back in there. It's got to beat Doc and Kitty's, right?

    <TEXT>I have no idea which mod of mine is doing this, but frankly with 200 mods I'd rather just use console commands to fix it. One of my mods made it so that when I try to increase my strength, my carry weight goes from 115 to almost 20,000 pounds (not a typo, *twenty fucking thousand.*) Now this is convenient, but I don't play Survival for convenience.  #8203; Could someone please give me the actual carry weight you start with if you have only one Strength, and also tell me if it's +10lbs per additional buff the way it is in lower difficulties?

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm An Urban Explorer [Part Thirteen]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-28 13:57:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Twelve](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g90apg/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; There's an entire park inside the park. Sorry, this is one of the most terrifying things that's ever happened to me. Also one of the coolest, but predominantly terrifying right now. I sat on the weird new cellar in Twin Vale for a few days, and then decided to talk to Oliver about it. Of everyone in the park, he's second only to Leah in just kind of rolling with whatever the hell happened to me. It might sound weird, but there's something kind of nice about being able to actually joke about it instead of tiptoeing around everyone. Also, he's got what people these days are apparently calling an  #8220;absolutely banging #8221; taste in movies.I'm not criticizing anyone here, I'm just saying ten years ago we would have said his movie collection was the shit, and banging was a verb *definitely* not related to whether or not something was great.Anyway, when I told him about the cellar his biggest surprise was that it wasn't connected to anything else. At least, not that I know of. I haven't been back down there yet.  #8220;You didn't know about the hidden park? #8221; Which, speaking as someone who once thought about swimming to Discovery Park on a family vacation, is about the most awesome thing anyone could ever say to me. The heat was bad enough today that we were taken offstage entirely from two to four, so I literally got paid for Oliver to take me through Hollywood the back way, which involved a ton of doors hidden with mirrors and poster panels and all kinds of other stuff. Most of the space we were passing through was completely empty, which is weird #8212;I've never seen anywhere in the park just *empty.*  #8220;So what's the story behind all the dead space? #8221; Oliver shook his head at me.  #8220;The chick who did this job before me showed me around, but she didn't know all that much. I know the space under the photo booth was originally planned to be the breakroom, but they changed it for some reason. And there's a room at the back of Casablanca I'm pretty sure was a movie theater, but like, *years* ago. I, uh. Might've pretended to leave one night and gone exploring, instead. Appreciate if you didn't tell Dale that. #8221; Dale's probably just a little lucky Oliver's straight, if I'm going to be totally honest. He's cool enough I don't think I'd try my luck because he's fun to hang with, but I might, if I had enough to drink. Something about there being an abandoned movie theater in Hollywood didn't strike me as right, so I asked if we could check it out, and seriously, I want to know who *built* this place. The door to the theater is totally invisible from the outside #8212;set hard against the corner of the back of the building, and with the door seam so perfectly camouflaged in the concrete that I leaned right against it before he pushed it open and never saw it. The inside was pitch black, not just dark but *painted* dark, but you could hear how big it was. There were no echoes, probably acoustic panels or something, but our voices still had to travel before getting eaten.  #8220;So just how much of this place have you seen? #8221;  #8220;Not much. My flashlight was dying and call me crazy, but I had this feeling if the door shut with me in here I'd never get out again. #8221;  #8220;Oh, that's comforting. #8221; I turned on my phone light and looked for the corners first.  #8220;Hey, you're right. Look. The far wall's white, to project on. And there's a projector booth. #8221;  #8220;Wonder if anything's still in it. #8221;  #8220;One way to find out. #8221; I headed for the ladder in the corner, wondering why there wasn't a staircase. Maybe it was to save space, but it seemed like a really weird setup.  #8220;You know, I have to tell you, I've always wanted to be one of those people who like, travels to abandoned places and stuff for fun just to take pictures. My inner fifteen-year-old is losing his *mind* right now. #8221;  #8220;You know what's even better? We're getting paid for this. #8221; I found the door to the projector booth and kind of frowned at it. The only way in was literally to push the door open with one hand and then crawl into the booth. I couldn't see any sign of an old platform or handles or anything that might've been removed, either. I finally got in, but it was a real squeeze. At least, I thought, there was a light switch. Which turned on absolutely nothing when I flicked it.  #8220;There's a reel-to-reel in here! #8221;  #8220;Holy shit, seriously? #8221; I couldn't see Oliver, but I could tell he was staring up at the booth. He kind of had that tone in his voice.  #8220;Yeah. Still loaded and everything. This is weird, Oliver. Dale's into this kind of stuff, these are *expensive.* Why would somebody leave it here? #8221;  #8220;Y'know, I've always gotten the impression the manager before Dale's dad wasn't exactly all there in the head. Maybe he forgot it. #8221;  #8220;Maybe. #8221; I shined my phone around the booth.  #8220;This is weird. Reel-to-reels usually come in two-part setups with a rewind machine. There's just the one machine and one reel. No rewind, no second projector, nothing. One reel isn't enough for a movie. And it doesn't look like anything was ever moved out of here. #8221; I stuck my head out the projector window.  #8220;And honestly, Oliver, if Dale knew this was here, I don't think it'd still be aband #8212;Jesus *Christ!* #8221; Dale probably knows how to operate a reel-to-reel. We had a DVD/VCR combo when we lived together, and I've seen him take three destroyed copies of the same movie and splice them into a single working copy with scotch tape and an exacto knife. For fun. I, on the other hand, welcomed DVDs as my savior from having to fix the tracking, and never looked back. I couldn't fix a VCR if you paid me. And I definitely couldn't operate a reel-to-reel. For that matter, I wasn't even touching it when it turned on. I fell backward on my ass and landed hand-first in something sticky but *thick,* like tar, all the way up to my wrist. Oliver started screaming at me to shut it down, and I started flicking every switch I could reach from my knees before I realized the damned thing wasn't even plugged in. I thought maybe I could push it over, but it was bolted down, so instead I bailed for the ladder. Something reached out the projector room door and slammed it shut when I was halfway down.Oliver was down near the white wall, banging on the corner and apparently trying to open a door that wasn't there. I grabbed his hand and dragged him back up to the door we came in through. I couldn't get it open, and then I realized there was a normal handle from the inside instead of just pushing like we'd done when we came in. We finally stopped running when we hit Ocean Boulevard. Ocean, like Second Street, is an employees-only road, and well out of the sight of parkgoers. Oliver just kind of stared at my hand. I looked down and realized it was covered in some kind of brownish-blackish-greenish . . . *stuff,* and pulled my hand up to smell it before making a face.  #8220;Rotten. Ugh. Is there a bathroom in your breakroom? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; He held the door open for me, and I washed my hands twice before asking the question I'm pretty sure both of us were thinking.  #8220;What the *fuck* was that? #8221;  #8220;Fucking weird, is what it was. Nathan, did you see the floor in there? #8221;  #8220;Gross? #8221;  #8220;I think I saw a body. When you turned the projector on. #8221;  #8220;I didn't turn it on. It wasn't even plugged in. And even if it was, there's no power to that part of the building. #8221; He just stared at me.  #8220;Then did you see the movie? #8221;  #8220;No? #8221;  #8220;Do you ever read creepypastas? #8221;  #8220;Used to love them, until my life turned into one. #8221;  #8220;It was like something out of one of those fucking, I don't know, lost episode ones, or something. I'm gonna have nightmares. Nathan, we've gotta tell Dale. If somebody's actually dead in there #8212; #8221;  #8220;Weird question, Oliver, are you sure it was a human being? #8221; His mouth fell open. He didn't answer me. I told him about the thing I didn't see in the projector room. Then I checked my phone, sure we were going to end up late back onstage. We were only in there for ten minutes. It felt like years. I know time works differently in the Underground and stuff, but I'm pretty sure we were still in our own place, this plane or dimension or whatever you want to call it #8212;we were just that scared. I suggested to Oliver we head into Casablanca and place a specific order. He thought I was nuts when I came back with milk, bread, and a fruit and cheese plate and put them right outside the hidden movie theater door, but I'm not fucking around with whatever's in there. I told Oliver to wait a day before telling Dale, but honestly, I don't know if I want to tell him at all. I have this bad feeling about anyone going back in there, and I'm wondering if I should nix my plans to go back in the cellar in Twin Vale. A lot of the places we walked through today just seemed abandoned or forgotten #8212;which is creepy in its own way, but it's *normal* creepy, *totally-of-this-physical-world* creepy #8212;but that theater didn't have that feeling. I felt watched. The question to me now is, does whatever's in there have to do with the Wild Ones? Did Oliver actually find a body? And just how much do I need to worry about it?

I was trying to imagine the Woody character from the parks and I was like  #8220;that isn #8217;t cute and doesn #8217;t make sense with everything else Leah told us, if I saw that I #8217;d run screaming. #8221; You see him as a face instead of a suit character and it makes a lot more sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He does in the rough draft. Toy Story was almost scrapped because Woody was *such a gigantic asshole* in the rough draft. The producer hated him *that much* he gave the crew like a week to the character or scrap the movie.  #8203; Which frankly, all things considered, is very darkly hilarious.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Panicking [Part Fourteen]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-29 13:27:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>\[\[Content warning on this chapter for body horror, a panic attack written by someone who actually has them, and a noose.\]\] [Part Thirteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/g9nnr4/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203;  #8203; *Fuck.* I should elaborate, that's . . . no, that about sums it up. Honestly, I'm kind of lucky today was Darius' birthday, or I might've missed it altogether and then things would be even worse, but they've gotten pretty bad. The heat wave has finally subsided, but it's still pretty hot, so we asked Dale if we could stay in the park until midnight to celebrate instead of doing cake in the morning. Not only did he say yes, he told us if one of the bartenders was willing to stay we could have drinks in Casablanca or Doc and Kitty's. We passed a hat, put together a couple hours' wages and some tip money, and got Jessie to stay. She's one of the Twin Vale bartenders, and when I approached her around six to ask if she'd stay she put aside some entrees to cut up into snacks, too. It was a pretty great party, and when we were done we cleared up the dining room for Jessie so all she had to do was load our plates and glasses into the dishwasher. We said our goodnights and headed home. There was a thunderstorm brewing, but not yet broken. So far, so normal. I woke up around two to noise coming out of Leah's bedroom. If you've ever heard a little kid having a nightmare, you know about what this was like. I got up and headed over to see if she was okay and saw her sitting on the side of the mattress, rocking back and forth with her arms around herself.  #8220;Leah? You okay? #8221; She gave me this absolutely terrible smile.  #8220;Yeah, I've had period cramps worse than this. I'll be okay. #8221; And then she let out this really awful gasp and leaned forward, panting, and I saw her shirt stick to her chest before she gave me this look like an animal caught in a trap.  #8220;Maybe not. #8221; I thought she might just be sweating, or possibly she got food poisoning, but when I got eye-to-eye with her I could see her collarbones over her tank top, and that idea went out the window fast. #8220;*Fuck.* Leah, we have to get you to the park. #8221; She looked scared. Terrified, even.  #8220;The park? #8221;  #8220;It's starting. I'm so sorry. Shit. Come on. We've gotta go. #8221; The elevator in Leah's building works, but it's incredibly slow and she only lives on the second floor, so I usually take the stairs. Today I wish I'd waited for the stupid thing #8212;we got three stairs down and her legs went out from under her. We made it to the bottom, but it was like trying to walk with a jellyfish, and when we got to the car I had to buckle her in. I called Dale as soon as I hit a straightaway. He sounded like he was still awake.  #8220;We need to get into the park. Now. We're on our way. #8221;  #8220;The hell . . . ? Nate, are you drunk? #8221;  #8220;I need to get Leah into the park, #8221; I said again, and took a look over at her while we sat at a red light. She was mostly curled into a ball around the seatbelt and crying a little.  #8220;But we need your keys. #8221;  #8220;You want me to drag my ass down there at two-thirty in the morning? Whatever you left there after your party, Nate, it can wait until morning. #8221;  #8220;She's fucking dying, Dale, if you're going to do this again I'll find a way to climb the fucking gates myself. #8221; It occurred to me in some part of my brain still trying to stay calm, I don't think Dale's ever seen me pissed before. Not in any meaningful capacity, anyway, there's a big difference between getting pissy with yourself for dropping a dish and actually being ready to strangle your ex. He was silent. I just kind of shook my head.  #8220;You know what? Forget it. #8221; I tossed my phone in the backseat. I heard it start ringing again, but ignored it. The entire last half of the drive is down a strip of highway that doesn't have streetlights because the park is the only thing out that way, and the town packs up early enough I figured I could floor it at this hour and not worry about cops. And I did, trying to think about what Leah might have in the trunk that I could use to get over the wall into the park, but Dale still beat us there. I pulled in and cut the lights, and saw him do the same. Leah sat up, but at this point her entire shirt was sticking to her and she was so pale she looked white. I wasn't actually totally sure she was fully conscious, either. I got out of the car and ran to Leah's side. She still couldn't unbuckle herself, and when I tried to help her out she went splaylegged on the ground again. I swore and tried to pull her up, and then Dale leaned down next to me and scooped her up.  #8220;Come on. Fuck. Okay. Shh. We've got you. Let's go. #8221; He swung his hip at me.  #8220;Keyring. Grab it. #8221; I pulled his park keys out of his pocket by the lanyard and ran for the gates. The keys have changed since I used to ride in mornings with him, and I spent way too long trying to find the right one, but the gate finally swung open, and Dale jogged past me with Leah in his arms. He laid her down on the bench under the willow by the entrance and pushed her hair out of her face. She whimpered.  #8220;She's breathing. Nate, what the fuck *is* this? #8221; I shook my head at him and tugged off her pajama top before the seepage from the blisters could stick it to open wounds.  #8220;Christ. #8221; Dale tugged the park keys out of my hand and headed for his office. He wasn't exactly jogging anymore, but he wasn't going slow, either, and it didn't take him long to come back out with a water jug and a first aid kit. Leah was still in that kind of soupy not-really-awake state, but she wasn't making that awful crying noise anymore and her breathing was getting more regular, which I took to be a good sign. Dale stopped at the bench and lifted her head so he could sit down.  #8220;Here, pull her up, I'll clean her back. #8221; I did, letting her rest her cheek on my shoulder, and Dale swore.  #8220;Her tattoos are gone. Totally gone. What the *fuck #8212;* #8221;  #8220;I read about that in her blog. They started bleeding out because there's iron in tattoo ink. She lost all the linework. #8221;  #8220;She lost *everything,* #8221; he said.  #8220;There's nothing here. Except blisters. Jesus. #8221; He started dabbing at her back with the water and a pack of paper towels. The light under the tree wasn't great #8212;just a single streetlamp, and the willow is trimmed short enough you can see the bench from outside but it's still a weeping willow #8212;but it was enough I could see red and yellow in the fluid he was washing away. I just pet her hair and kept babbling the kind of nonsense you say to a hurt little kid, like *shhh* and *it's okay* even though, very obviously, it was *not* even a little bit okay.  #8220;This is going to sting like a bitch, sorry, #8221; I heard Dale say, and then I heard a kind of little plasticky click and Leah made a hurt noise and more or less tried to crawl into my chest.  #8220;Dale, you're fucking *hurting* her #8212; #8221;  #8220;I'm not leaving this to get infected. #8221; I looked up to snipe at him and saw a bottle of rubbing alcohol in his hand.  #8220;Almost over. Shh. Okay. I don't have anything that's going to cover this, I've just got bandaids. #8221;  #8220;Anything you put on'd just stick anyway. Switch me? #8221; He nodded, and I held Leah up by the shoulders while Dale scooted out and took my place before I sat down behind her and leaned her against me again, and he went to work cleaning her front.  #8220;Boy, #8221; she said, and her voice was weak and broken but still loud enough in the otherwise-silent park to make us both jump,  #8220;if you asked me to imagine being topless with a pair of guys this is *not* how it'd go. #8221; Dale let out a grim laugh and went back to his swabbing before pulling out the alcohol again.  #8220;Last time. Longest thirty seconds of your life and it's over, promise. #8221; Leah nodded, but she still tried to squirm away from the alcohol. I can't blame her. I've had those burns. Getting them cleaned is probably better than leaving them dirty, but I can't imagine having to actually put antiseptic on them. There was another plasticky snap #8212;Dale closing the bottle. Leah shivered, and I pulled off my tee and slipped it over her head. I heard Dale gasp and realized he probably had no idea what happened to me on the coach, but between my scars and Leah's blisters he could figure it out pretty easily.  #8220;We're going to have to find a place she can go. She can't just sleep on a bench. It's exposed and any minute now the rain's going to start. #8221;  #8220;I can stay with Mr. Scratch, it's okay. #8221;  #8220;I'm not putting you in a cage. #8221; Dale actually sounded angry. I remembered something from Leah's blog, him telling her not to think of the pretenders as human. Times have certainly changed and challenged, if your name is Dale and you run a cursed amusement park.  #8220;There used to be a living room hidden in Candyland,but fucked if I remember where. #8221;  #8220;I can stay in the maintenance shed for the night to keep out of the rain. #8221; Leah sounded like some kind of Victorian heroine recovering from fever.  #8220;Where they keep the hay for Mr. Scratch. I used to do that with a friend when I was a kid, we'd sleep in the barn. #8221; Dale looked at me like he was asking a question. I nodded.  #8220;There's some ponchos and stuff in the Twin Vale costume room. We can put something down so she's got blankets. Kind of. #8221; Dale nodded and passed me his keys again.  #8220;You go to Twin Vale. I'll take her over to horror. There's a flashlight in my desk. Top left drawer. It's one of those giant industrial ones, you can't miss it. #8221; I grabbed the flashlight and headed for Twin Vale. There are streetlamps there #8212;old-timey ones that look like the ones that needed lamplighters, they flicker and everything #8212;but they're on a timer. There's no reason to have them on once staff is gone, so they shut off at midnight. By the time I got up to Twin Vale, the rain was finally coming down #8212;just a few drops at a time, those fat warm drops that look dime-sized on the sidewalk and feel like tiny bursts of shock cutting through the humidity haze. And then all hell broke loose, and between Leah and Twin Vale I'm starting to wonder if I'm losing my mind. I've told you before what Twin Vale looks like. Literally the only way to get lost in it is to walk down the wrong street, and then you just turn around and head back to the plaza. That's it. I thought I could find my way around in my sleep, and Second is literally in a straight line from the entrance #8212;walk in, walk down Main, there's Second #8212;but I was wrong, apparently, because I got completely turned around. The third time I walked into the main plaza, I started to freak out a little, especially because the rain was going from fat to driving. I was sure I hadn't actually turned anywhere. Straight shot, no reason to do anything but go forward. I ran through the plaza, feeling like I must be wasting far too much time, and found myself down by Jack's. Turned around, and the leathersmith shop was right behind me even though it's actually on First. I ran back toward it, sure I'd end up in the plaza again, and instead I ended up by the little cluster of kids' rides on the far end of Union without ever going through the plaza. I decided to just run out to Gold and take it around, but when I got to the end of Union I was in the plaza again, and at that point I said fuck it #8212;Doc and Kitty's has a little stash of table linens for people getting married and stuff, and it had to be at least as good as a poncho. If I kept running in circles I'd still be going at sunup and I'd be carrying things back to Leah in a downpour. So I turned toward it, and saw myself hanging from the end of the porch. You can probably understand why I screamed. I dropped the flashlight. It went out. Lightning flashed, and instead of me on the porch I saw Warin, hanging from the same noose and giving me that shitty dripping-black ask-if-I-care grin while I backed away so fast I fell on my ass. I got my feet again and kept going. Someone grabbed my shoulder. I turned around #8212;nothing there. I took off running again and felt someone slap my hip, but when I tried to knock them aside I just hit air. I tripped over a barrel outside one of the shops and fell and felt someone, maybe the same someone, take an iron grip on my wrist. My glasses went flying. And then I heard Dale shouting my name and he picked me up.  #8220;What happened? #8221; I tried to explain, but I couldn't make actual sentences work. I finally just spit out  #8220;*him* #8221; to try and get the point across and waved behind me at Doc and Kitty's. There are some things you just don't want to see.  #8220;Doc and Kitty's? #8221;  #8220;The *body*, Dale, the *body,* they *brought him #8212;* #8221;  #8220;Nate, there's nothing there. #8221; I didn't want to look, but I had to. The porch was kind of blurry without my glasses, but he was right. The only thing on it was the same old rocking chair and barrel setup as always.  #8220;Did you get the ponchos? #8221; Somehow, I managed to explain that no, I'd spent the last who knew how long running in circles. Dale frowned at me in the light from his phone.  #8220;Let's go grab them and get out of here. You're panicking. #8221; He did a quick scan of the ground and found my glasses.  #8220;I just saw Warin in a *noose*, Dale, he #8212; #8221; He kind of made this shushing noise as soon as I said the name.  #8220;Look, this is the first time you've been here in the dark since you've been out and it's a hell of a night. But you're *extremely* wigged out and I think your brain took whatever you actually saw and turned it into nightmare fuel for you. #8221;  #8220;Dale, *I saw him.* And me. He was me. Before he was him he was me. #8221;  #8220;Okay, #8221; he said, but I could tell he was humoring me.  #8220;I'll talk to Madeleine tomorrow and see if I can figure out what happened. Let's just get what we need and get out of here, okay? #8221;  #8220;I lost your flashlight. #8221;  #8220;It's okay. #8221; He flipped his phone as we headed down Main. Totally normal, not in circles, only one plaza Main.  #8220;Leah, #8221; I heard him say. I was only half paying attention, though #8212;I kept looking in windows and doorways and not being sure if it was better or worse to see nothing there.  #8220;Yeah, he's okay. He had a panic attack. I should've sent him with you in the first place. You okay? Good. Drink some more water. We'll see you in a few minutes. #8221;  #8220;How'd you know? #8221; I almost panicked again over the keys before remembering I'd dropped the lanyard over my neck when I started running. I unlocked the costume shop and flipped on the light. I've never been so grateful for electricity in my life.  #8220;Nate, I'm pretty sure people three counties over know. You've got a hell of a yell on you when you're scared. #8221; We scavenged three ponchos and one of those long gunslinger duster-type things, and after we locked the door again Dale took the keys and steered us behind the building. There are a couple of maintenance golf carts in the park, and there's usually one in Twin Vale because of the size of the place. I told him what I thought about the tablecloths in Doc and Kitty's, and he nodded.  #8220;Let's just pick one up in horror. #8221; The ones in horror were black instead of white, but it sounded like a fine idea to me, and when we had it doubled up and laid over some loose hay Leah flopped on it like we'd given her Serta's finest. I tossed a poncho down next to her and sat down, and she stared up at me.  #8220;What are you doing? #8221;  #8220;I'm not making you stay here alone, are you crazy? #8221;  #8220;Go home, Nathan. #8221; I opened my mouth and she waved a hand to stop me.  #8220;I've got Mr. Scratch. I'll be okay. Go home. #8221; She smiled, and I could tell as bad as my night was, hers was worse. She looked exhausted.  #8220;I appreciate the offer, but no. #8221; I wanted to argue, but finally I just kissed her forehead and did what I could to tuck her in. She was back out before we even closed the shed. Dale grabbed a cinderblock from outside and eased it back into the shed behind the door so he could leave it cracked without the door blowing open in the rain to give Leah some air and what might pass as a nightlight--the streetlamps go out, but the light on the front of the maintenance shed doesn't.  #8220;I'm sorry, #8221; he said, as we headed back for the entrance.  #8220;I didn't know what you meant when you said you needed back in here. I would've been here even sooner if I had. #8221; I just kind of nodded at him. Adrenaline crash is a hell of a drug. He locked the gate again.  #8220;Do you need somewhere to go? #8221;  #8220;I've got Leah's key. #8221;  #8220;That isn't what I meant, and you know it. #8221; I thought about it for a second #8212;as best I could, anyway, if that's what panic attacks feel like I never want another one #8212;and nodded.  #8220;Okay. Come on. #8221; He helped me into the truck and got me settled with the truck blanket around my shoulders before taking Leah's keys and moving the car into a more unobtrusive #8212;and actually properly-parked #8212;spot. He came back and gave me the keys and my phone. I haven't actually been back in our apartment since I left the park, and today I've mostly just stayed in the kitchen, but last night I literally only got around by muscle memory. I couldn't have told you what was different and what was the same if you paid me. Dale sat me down at the table and gave me some warm milk, which probably would have made me laugh under different circumstances, and then he dug out a pair of pajama bottoms from somewhere. I have no idea where. I've never known Dale to bother with nightclothes, but he sent me to the bathroom with the bottoms and a tee-shirt to replace the one I gave Leah and to change out of the bottoms I'd basically destroyed in Twin Vale. And then he tucked *me* in, and you can call it stupid if you want to, but I know I slept better knowing someone else was next to me. Maybe it was his weight on the mattress, maybe it was being able to smell the sheets even in my sleep and know I wasn't back on the fucking stagecoach, but I actually made it through the night without waking up. I didn't wake up until Dale was already gone, actually. He left me a note on the kitchen table with Leah's keys that he was considering me called out sick, and said if I needed to get anywhere he'd get me a cab, and that I should call when I woke up to check in. I did, and found out Maxine brought Leah clean clothes and Darius was trying to find a futon to put somewhere on park grounds. Dale had the idea that the longer we could keep things as normal as possible, the more time it might buy me to find her a way out.  #8220;Did she get a shower? #8221;  #8220;There isn't one on park grounds, but I took her some more water to wash with. And soap. #8221; He paused.  #8220;I should've done all this ten years ago. #8221;  #8220;At least you're doing it now. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, I guess. #8221; He paused again.  #8220;I went down to Twin Vale this morning with Gary. We covered the whole porch at Doc and Kitty's. I don't know what you saw last night, but there are no hooks anyone could actually hang the weight of a body from. Hell, there aren't even any extra nails. Or holes where something might've been taken out. I haven't talked to Madeleine yet, but if there was something there, it wasn't physical. Not the way you and I would normally use that word. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; The body looked pretty damn deadweight to me, but I was also losing my mind, and for all I know Warin can levitate and go as limp as he wants.  #8220;I'm going to stay here for awhile today. If that's okay. #8221;  #8220;It's your place too. Even if you're not sure you want to keep it yet. #8221;  #8220;Thanks. #8221; So that's where we are today: the other actors are taking care of Leah in my absence, I've stress-cooked enough to fill Dale's freezer for a month, and I need to get one hell of a move on. You know. Before it's too late. [Part Fifteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gbht83/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

It #8217;s almost the end of June, nobody #8217;s seen him since the beginning of April, he can #8217;t possibly have been just hiding all that time. Especially with the park open again.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Historian [Part Fifteen]</TITLE>

    <TEXT>[Part Fourteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/ga9fii/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) Well, I'm back to work. I ended up staying an extra night at Dale's. I was going to ask if he could drop me at Leah's last night, but he'd still have had to pick me up in the morning, and he asked if I needed to go but also had that  #8220;I'm so exhausted if you say yes I'll cry #8221; look. Okay, and also if I'm going to be totally honest I didn't exactly want to go. Really, last night is the best way to explain Dale. We slept next to each other in the same bed we shared for two years and he never tried his luck, but when I woke up at three in the morning with nightmares he was up almost before I was, and he didn't stop holding me until I stopped crying. And then he brought me a wet washcloth and a glass of water, because giving people things to drink is Dale's way of handling everything. I nixed the water, but I let him wash my face. And then we went back to sleep. If you don't get why I'm torn between wanting to tell him to fuck off and wanting to tell him to fuck me at this point, I can't help you. We stopped by Leah's this morning so I could change out of Dale's pajamas and pick up some stuff for Leah, and water her spider plant. It was starting to put out baby plants, so I pinched one off and put it in water to take her. I made some pancake batter and threw it in a pan while I went hunting for food and underwear, too. It was Bisquick instead of from scratch, but it had to be better than yesterday's funnel cakes. ' I tossed two bags and a box in the back of the truck before hauling myself back in: two books, as many half-decent prepackaged snacks as I could find, clothes, Leah's laptop. Her pillow. The zip-up sweatshirt she left perpetually tossed on the end of the couch for convenience's sake. You know, the kind of stuff you start missing, when you're away from home. We pulled up at the same time as Gary. Dale tipped him a terse salute and looked over at me. Ten years ago, this is the part where we'd kiss goodbye before putting aside the boyfriend business to go do the work business. This time he just took in a breath like he was going to say something, let it out, and said  #8220;Leah's in Candyand #8221; before getting out and unlocking the truck bed.  #8220;You find that living room thing you were talking about? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. Some of the other actors turned it into a studio for her. #8221; He paused.  #8220;And the Diva, apparently. She showed up, gave Leah a champagne glass, and left. #8221;  #8220;I didn't know any of the pretenders could leave our sections. Except . . . you know. And now Madeleine. #8221;  #8220;They can't. Well #8212;couldn't. I don't know if a certain departure freed them from that. Or if maybe . . . under the circumstances . . .  #8221;  #8220;Welcome wagon for the new arrival? #8221;  #8220;Something like that. #8221; Dale hoisted the box into his arms. I grabbed the bags and swung the bed shut with my hip. Candyland is nowhere near as easy to navigate as the other three sections. The main road goes in a kind of lumpy circle, there are all kinds of little side-roads where the rides are, and right in the middle of it is a fairytale plaza with another couple of random roads going through it #8212;Jack and the Beanstalk, Hansel and Gretel, those ones. There's a castle at the far end of it #8212;a little one, with a combination gift shop and restaurant inside, of course called King Arthur's Court #8212;and as we headed toward it I looked up at its main window and felt a chill. I never noticed it before, but the story on the stained-glass window is the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and the window was open. I guess I should've guessed the hidden living room would be on the other side of it. When I was a waiter here, I subbed in King Arthur's a couple times. I've always known it to be a two-story building #8212;the gift shop and most of the public restaurant seating downstairs, birthday parties upstairs. Turns out, if you go into the gift shop and go behind the counter, there's a doorway that's hidden completely by forced perspective on one side and a display on the other, and it leads straight to a staircase #8212;right up to a *third* floor. Dale grabbed a horseshoe off the end of the railing as we passed. There isn't just a living room up there, either #8212;there's a bathroom and, something I found out when he opened the door and slid the horseshoe inside, an old radio broadcasting studio.  #8220;Dale . . . ? #8221;  #8203; "She can get out if she has to and nobody's come yet. It'd hurt until she was past it, but she can get out. It's just certain other parties can't get *in.*"  #8203; Fair enough. And probably smart. "That was a microphone?"  #8220;There was a deejay here in the sixties and seventies. The transmission tower's in the castle spire. They used to play nursery rhymes and stuff. Every hour on the hour he'd give the time and every hour on the half he'd give Candyland news about the old actors, giving you hints where you could find them. You know, Little Red Riding Hood was spotted, that kind of thing. When my dad took over the park he cut it. #8221;  #8220;And the studio was never dismantled? #8221;  #8220;Nope. #8221; Dale knocked on a door on the right side of the hall, then opened it softly when there was no answer. The room Leah's in right now is a hell of a lot better than a maintenance shed in horror. There's the window #8212;which is creepy, but from the inside the light coming in is pretty, too #8212;with one of those little mini Zen stone fountains in it, and a sofa. Darius found a futon. The coffee table got repurposed into a nightstand, with a lamp and a phone charger and everything. Dale's small file cabinet was sitting in the corner with a microwave on top of it. Someone brought her bedding, and she'd made herself right at home in it. She was still out like a light. Dale set down the box of snacks and pulled down the neck of her tee-shirt enough to see what was underneath, and then nodded at it before kind of jerking his head to motion me out of the room. I set down the bags on the coffee table and followed him out.  #8220;Anne and I cleaned her up again last night after park close, but it was still pretty nasty. Looks like everything's scabbing over now she's got the chance to actually rest. #8221;  #8220;You'll be amazed how fast it'll heal over. Until she tries to leave again, anyway. #8221; I was pretty sure Dale was going to say something, but he didn't. He knew exactly how I knew what I was talking about. I gave him a minute to make up his mind before I nodded up at the window.  #8220;So given how this place was founded . . . why the *hell* would anybody want the Pied Piper in here? #8221;  #8220;It was dictated by upper management. #8221; Dale nodded toward the outdoor seating, and I took it. It's almost July, but in the morning it's still pretty nice.  #8220;It's a true story, you know. The Pied Piper. The rats came later, but in 1284 a piper really did come to Hamelin and really did take the children away. There was a window put up in the local church sixteen years later to commemorate it. Scholars have been trying to figure out for years what actually happened. #8221;  #8220;But you know. #8221;  #8220;Yeah. I know. #8221; Dale looked glum.  #8220;Am I allowed to know? Just, you know, curiosity's sake? #8221;  #8220;Probably nothing you can't guess yourself. Upper management calls them  #8220;the old-worlders, #8221; but it's the same group. The original deal had nothing to do with rats. There was a famine. The old-worlders made a deal with the town: here's a bit of our land up on a hill, plant it for us with wheat and fruit, harvest it and make us bread, we'll make sure your crops grow but don't take a single bite of ours. #8221;  #8220;And the kids ate the fruit. #8221;  #8220;Told you there wasn't anything about this story you couldn't guess. Of course, in 1284 saying you made a deal with the fair folk was a great way to get the Pope to send people to raze your entire village, so they made up some bullshit about a mysterious piper instead of a faerie parade. #8221; He gave me this look so somber you'd think somebody'd died.  #8220;A friendly little reminder of what we stand to lose. According to Oliver, the two of you found another one. Don't look at me that way. He panicked when he found out about Leah and asked if the two of you pissing around where you had no business being could've caused this. #8221;  #8220;Could it? #8221; Dale shook his head.  #8220;Doubtful. You know what that place was, though, right? #8221;  #8220;A movie theatre. #8221;  #8220;Yes. #8221; Dale suddenly squeezed his eyes shut and slapped himself. I dropped my coffee and grabbed his arm. He opened his eyes and stared down at his hand, then pinched his nose. My coffee was a total loss, but the breeze was light enough I still had my napkin, and I pushed it into his hand. He finagled it around his nose to help with the sudden unexpected appearance of a nosebleed in his morning.  #8220;Them? #8221;  #8220;Them, #8221; he confirmed, voice muffled by his hand.  #8220;Speaking of places you're not supposed to go #8212; #8221;  #8220;Dale, *don't #8212;* #8221; He waved a hand at me.  #8220;Remember you asked when St. Macabre's went in? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, but #8212; #8221;  #8220;I found a bunch of old blueprints from the park development. I know you're into that shit. Thought you might like a look, as long as you don't go running into half-rotten abandoned areas. Consider it payback for filling my fridge. #8221; He pulled the napkin away from his nose, examined it, dabbed at his nose, nodded, and threw the napkin out before standing up. I was going to protest again when it hit me: half-rotten. To the average ear, just a descriptor. But to somebody who knows the park's maintenance just a little bit . . . . anything routinely maintained wouldn't be rotten at all. And anything totally abandoned for so long it'd vanished from view would be more than half-rotten. *I see what you did there.* Hopefully no other significant parties did, though.  #8220;I will, thanks. #8221; I had three hours before call, so I took the file Dale gave me and headed back to the outdoor tables in Candyland to flip through it. Some of the papers were so old they were yellow; some of the others had clearly fallen apart years prior and been recently restored. I looked at the carefully-cut and scraped lines of tape and knew exactly who'd done the restoration. I know Dale's work when I see it. He was right: even without knowing if anything in these pages was of interest to Leah's cause, it was cool to look at just to see how the place had grown and changed. I flicked through invoices and scale maps, some of them so big they'd take up the entire table when unfolded, and then paused on one labeled *1999 Expansion Project 11/99.* Most of it was blocked out in Dale's dad's handwriting #8212;I'd seen it on enough greeting cards and letters and old park paperwork to know. But one structure wasn't: a building in the horror section, readily identifiable 20 years later as St. Macabre's. But Rick had originally labeled it as *Holmes House,* only for his label to be aggressively scratched out and replaced with a single word in jagged letters: ***her.*** Laila's hiring documents were right behind it. October of 1999. I just stared down at the papers for a minute. Her resume said she'd just graduated college with a degree in marine biology. She'd included a headshot #8212;something all the actors needed, to make sure they fit the character profile #8212;and it didn't take somebody interested in girls to know she was drop-dead gorgeous. Rick's writing covered the resume, and near the bottom he'd written something startling: *Silent Hill/HH attendant?* When we were in high school, Dale and I hung out with this group of four people who basically became friends with each other because nobody else would. One of them was a girl named Veronica. She went by Vinnie, and she was a hardcore gamer before that concept even really existed #8212;puzzle games, shooters, RPGs, she loved all of them. She used to joke she was going to have three kids: Riven, Gex, and Majora. And if you got her to open her mouth on whatever she was playing at the time, you'd never get her to shut up. Which I guess was fair enough, since I spent the exact same time period never shutting up about My Chemical Romance and being secretly, hopelessly in love with Gerard Way. I knew exactly what Rick meant by Silent Hill. I wondered if there were any pictures of Laila in costume before the change, and when I flipped behind the resume I found one. It wasn't particularly good. Dale would've just been getting into photography at that point, and he didn't know anything yet about photo composition, so it was weirdly framed and the light was bad. But it wasn't blurry. She was standing behind the arcade with a cigarette between her fingers. And yes #8212;if you knew what Rick's inspiration for the costume was it was absolutely clear, but more importantly #8212;to me, at least #8212;it was nearly identical to what the Nurse wears now. More cleavage, and with a mask instead of a broken jaw, but still easy to see how she'd gone from one to the other. And at some point she was planned to transition to a new character, but before she could, Warin happened, and whatever Holmes House was, it was turned into . . . . *Turned into.* I flipped back by about seventy years and found the Hollywood plans. Sure enough, there it was, marked in the plain but elegant hand of whoever'd been in charge at that point . . . no, very specifically someone who'd marked their initials in the bottom right corner of the map as *R.L.M.* Robert. Robert oversaw this plan. Robert was the one who'd indicated a large building, just off the main plaza of Hollywood, as *Bijou Theatre.* It was Casablanca. And also the abandoned theatre attached to it. The door through which Oliver and I had entered was marked *employee and colored entrance*, and I made a face at it before it hit me: it was a Jim Crow theatre. The back half was fitted with a cheap whitewash screen and a single projector in a subpar booth, probably also run by a black employee. There might have been a reel rewind in there at some point, but they hadn't put in the expense for a multi-projector setup, not for the black audience. The front half, well, I'm pretty sure the outside of Casablanca is still 90% what was once the Bijou, and I doubt the white audience had a painted screen, let's put it that way. I grabbed my legal pad and sketched out Casablanca #8212;front of house, back of house, and bar. Then I added the abandoned section. Then I put another piece of paper on top, outlined the building, marked off the projector booth in the Crow section and where the vaudeville stage must have been, and held both papers up to the sun. *I knew it.* I told you before Dale's a film buff. If it has to do with cameras #8212;either the still or motion kind #8212;he's all over it. Which is how I know way, way too much about silent movies and the soundtracks provided to them by theatrical pianists. It was guesswork. A lot of it. But if the modern-day kitchen was once part of the Crow theatre, and the modern-day wine storage and bar was the projector's booth and staircase for the whites-only theatre, then the Pianist's stand would fall right next to the wall of the Crow theatre, down by the screen, where a theatrical pianist would have sat. The modern-day raised seating section lined up perfectly with my estimate of a stage. And if the weird little dead-end kitchen hallway with the cash register was once a door between the two halves of the theatre . . . No wonder the back half was abandoned. The beginning of integration probably gave them a good excuse to shut it down, but I doubt that was the real reason. I'd be willing to bet cash Robert was turned in the Crow theatre. Maybe Grace, too, come to think of it. They headed out one night through that back entrance, and Warin was waiting for them. I rifled back through the pages so hard I almost tore them. *Three years. She came to the park three years ago. Warin spotted her almost right away. Dale's added things and taken them out since I ended up on the stagecoach, but there hasn't been a major renovation project . . . .* And then I spotted it, and almost threw up on the spot. A blueprint of the horror section, in Dale's handwriting, marked two months before Leah's hire date. Part of the arcade was missing in the blueprint, and in its place was something labeled *hallway to hell.* Probably a working title, but it didn't really matter, because someone had scratched it out, and the same jagged hand from the 1999 blueprint had written over it: ***Leah.***  #8203;  #8203; [Part Sixteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gc5kl0/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's true.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Highway Robber [Part Sixteen]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-02 12:22:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Fifteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gbht83/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Life's been pretty shitty lately. So today was kind of a nice change. I only ever worked one Fourth of July at the park, and my experience with it had literally been  #8220;the bartender needs somebody to open beers #8221; because it was so busy. According to Oliver and Caroline, though, it was going to be just as wild outside. I was advised to fill my flask right before going onstage and stop often, and told I should try to get offstage every two hours, even for just five minutes, just to kind of let my brain catch up so I didn't hit a wall right in front of a group of kids. Leah asked me to bring sunscreen, and we spent ten minutes in her room smearing it everywhere we could reach. I even went up under her hairline around her ears, since her costume is hatless. Oh. There is one other thing I should tell you. We'd had a staff meeting the night before. Just the actors, mostly going over what we could expect for the day, how to handle breaks, shutdown everywhere but Hollywood for the fireworks, that kind of stuff. We also decided it was better to beg forgiveness than ask permission, at least where Dale is concerned. Which is why at one o'clock, about an hour after park open, I hid Leah in the little cellar in Twin Vale with one of the doors open, and Oliver behind the false front on the leathersmith's, and parked myself on the porch at Doc and Kitty's, waiting for Mitchell and the horses to pull by. As soon as he got to the leathersmith's, I let out the biggest *yee-hoo* whoop I could and jumped off the porch. Leah darted out of the cellar, and from the roof of the leathersmith I heard three loud pops: the crackers in Oliver's popgun going off. He slid down one of the front porch posts, and all three of us surrounded the stagecoach. Around us, a crowd of parkgoers was reaching for phones and cameras #8212;they knew a show start when they saw one. There were no good girls' costumes in the Twin Vale costume shop where we found Oliver's poncho and gunbelt, but Maxine is part of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and she'd gotten Leah into a shift and corset and button-up boots with this long ruffled purple and red skirt that looked like it belonged on a Wild West brothel madam. So, you know, perfect.  #8220;Hand over the reins, son, #8221; I told Mitchell, and he did a decent job looking offended.  #8220;What do you think you're doing? #8221; Leah stepped up.  #8220;Rumor has it there's a hundred thousand dollars in gold bullion in that coach, mister, straight from California back to Dodge to head east. #8221;  #8220;None of your business if there is or there isn't. Out of my way. #8221; Mitchell picked up the horsewhip I'd never actually used or carried, like he was going to unlimber it, and Leah pulled out this ridiculous little revolver I'd actually found in a box of  #8220;Indian headdresses #8221; that wouldn't have been considered okay even when I first ended up on the stagecoach.  #8220;I say, it *is* our business, Mister Wells Fargo Man. Now why don't you do what the nice man said and hand it over? #8221;  #8220;This gold is the property of the United States Government, missy, now #8212; #8221; Oliver's popgun let out another bang. I couldn't see him around the horses, but he'd demonstrated his I'm-a-black-hat grin this morning, and I could imagine it perfectly. Mitchell dropped the whip.  #8220;Missed you on purpose, son, now I think you want to listen to Jane and Martin before I change my mind. #8221; Mitchell's gasp wasn't exactly Broadway quality, but he tried.  #8220;Martin Eastwood and Smiling Jane Hart? #8221; He jerked his head back toward Oliver.  #8220;And Tannen Brown? #8221; I tipped my hat to him.  #8220;See you've heard of us. Now I'll say this one last time, you can hand over those reins, and there's a friendly Sioux campment near here we can drop you off in. Or Tannen there can change his mind, and there's some awfully hungry buzzards through here who'll be happier for it. #8221;Mitchell pulled out his own ridiculous revolver and aimed it at me. Leah pulled her trigger, and I had just enough time to hope I'd actually loaded the blanks right, or we were all going to look like a bunch of unarmed idiots. There was a loud bang, and Mitchell dropped his revolver.  #8220;My hand! #8221;  #8220;You know, they say if I challenged Annie Oakley she'd lose, #8221; Leah told him.  #8220;Last chance, mister." Mitchell dropped the reins. The horses stamped, finally nervous. And then it hit me, of the three of us in this last-minute Wild West gang, I was the only one who knew how to drive. Well. Too late to back out now. So I swung on and beckoned Oliver up with me.  #8220;Tannen, tie his hands. Jane, you're the caboose on this merry train. You got enough bullets? #8221;  #8220;I could take the whole U.S. Cavalry, if they were dumb enough to try it. #8221; Leah climbed onto the bar at the back of the stagecoach, where a signalman would have been in real life.  #8220;Let's go, Marty. #8221; I gave the horses a yell and we took off, people cheering and clapping behind us. I gave Oliver a grin over Mitchell's head. Mitchell snickered, then squeezed my knee #8212;the kind of reassuring thing you'd normally do to somebody's shoulder, if, you know, you weren't supposed to be their prisoner, with your hands tied between your knees.  #8220;We're gonna be in so much trouble. #8221;  #8220;Nah, Dale's gonna be pissed right up until he hears someone say it was the shit, and then he's going to *act* like we're in trouble but we won't be. #8221; I turned down Union #8212;the shortest way to Gold and back off the damned coach #8212;and then pulled up to Jack's Place.  #8220;Forgot there was an actual hitching post here. #8221; I threw the reins around it, and Mitchell stared up at me, mouth open.  #8220;You can do that *without getting off?* #8221;  #8220;Um . . . yeah? That's the point in it being so high. #8221; I jumped down and helped Leah off the back. You could tell she'd been laughing all the way to Jack's, hair falling out of the little Victorian roll Maxine'd put it in, skirt hitched up to keep it out of the wheels.  #8220;That. Was. *Awesome.* #8221;  #8220;*Was* it, now, #8221; I heard Dale's voice say, and I kind of felt my heart sink a little. I was hoping to get Leah and Oliver out of the way before he found us.  #8220;Why the hell is it, whenever something happens around here, it's always you two? #8221; I turned around to defend the rest of my band of outlaws and immediately found myself faced with Dale, not the manager who hired me as an actor this year but the one who first told me he could get a job a decade ago: clean-shaven, buttoned shirt and neat jeans, decently-not-messy hair, and I kind of forgot what I meant to say. Which is probably why it's lucky I had a co-conspirator, honestly, because I don't think I could've gotten anything out if I'd tried.  #8220;Okay, just being fair here, this was at least halfway my idea, #8221; Mitchell protested.  #8220;Nathan just ran with it. #8221;  #8220;I just thought if it's the Fourth of July and we have a whole Wild West section we should be *doing* something with it, #8221; Oliver said.  #8220;You don't get much more American than Old West stuff. #8221;  #8220;I just wanted to do something fun, #8221; Leah said, and she drooped so far I wanted to yell at Dale even though he was just doing his job. And wearing Levis.  #8220;Christ. Don't make that face at me, Leah, you're worse than Nathan. #8221; He sighed.  #8220;Did *any* of you, Leah and Nathan especially, think about the implications of your  #8220;something fun #8221; involving waving a bunch of guns around? #8221; I was about to say they weren't loaded when Leah gasped and covered her mouth before shaking her head, and I realized what he meant. Dale shook his own.  #8220;Hand them over, #8221; he said, and the other three did, so quickly it looked like a dance. I was going to point out mine was part of my costume, but then I remembered so was Mitchell's, and I just gave it to him.  #8220;I have to get to a meeting. Mitchell, get the coach back on circuit. Nathan, get back onstage. Leah #8212; #8221; He kind of paused for a second.  #8220;How the hell did you two have the time to get over here, anyway? #8221;  #8220;Caroline's watching the Diva, #8221; Oliver said.  #8220;She doesn't have anything to do until two-thirty anyway. #8221;  #8220;I had Mr. Scratch out around ten and I was going to give him his first break at twelve-thirty and take an hour to come over here and get back, but pretty much as soon as the park opened he dragged me back to his kennel, #8221; Leah told him.  #8220;He did *not* like all those people today. #8221; Dale grunted and headed off. I thought about following him, but didn't #8212;work-Dale had a meeting, and work-Nathan was in some kind of shit of indeterminate depth, and I didn't want to risk work-Nathan and boyfriend-Nathan, who's still pissed but increasingly having an existential crisis about it, getting crossed. I was the first one on break, at four, and as soon as I got back Madeleine was waiting for me behind Doc and Kitty's. She handed me a note. I read it, groaned, and headed for Dale's office. I met Oliver and Leah on the way there, so I guessed it was going to be all four of us. Or maybe Mitchell was excused because of the horses, which was my guess when I realized he wasn't there. Dale waved us all in. He had his feet up on the desk again. It sounds like he fucks off a lot when I say that, but he kind of sits that way everywhere. Even when we were in high school, I don't think I ever saw him sit like a normal person. Our prop revolvers were spread out in front of him.  #8220;Your little stunt could have gotten us in a hell of a lot of trouble today, #8221; he started.  #8220;If it wasn't the Fourth I doubt anybody outside Twin Vale would've mistaken these things for firecrackers, and I wouldn't have been able to tell them what was going on. Leah, Nathan, you two know even better what's at stake, bringing an unholstered prop like this into Twin Vale without permission. #8221; We all nodded at him. I felt just a little bit like a kid in the principal's office. Dale gestured at the revolvers.  #8220;Lucky for all of you, your little gunfight already made it onto YouTube, and everyone thinks it was an officially-sanctioned performance. Reviews are in and they loved it. So you'll be doing it again at six. #8221; Dale nodded at me.  #8220;Nathan, Mitchell's on break so he'll be back in time. Take him his gun. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; Leah and Oliver ran off to change, but I stayed behind. Dale shuffled some pictures into a file #8212;the YouTube video, probably #8212;and looked up at me.  #8220;Need something? #8221;  #8220;I gave you a lot of trouble today. I wanted to apologize. #8221; Dale looked kind of surprised. Then he chuckled and shook his head.  #8220;Nate, the day you *stop* giving me trouble is when I start to worry. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, well, most of the trouble I give you doesn't land you in 'meetings' on a day absolutely no American human beings would be having meetings. #8221;  #8220;You're not wrong. But it turned out all right. #8221; He looked exhausted.  #8220;I was mostly worried for Leah, if I'm honest. She almost got killed in this park because my dumb ass gave her an old revolver. I had a hell of a time explaining the connection between the Old West and the Fourth of July in American popular imagination, but we got there eventually. #8221;  #8220;So we get to go play dress-up. #8221;  #8220;Yeah. Speaking of which, I'd get back if I were you. #8221; He tapped his phone.  #8220;You've got 45 minutes to get into Twin Vale, fill in Mitchell, and get everyone positioned. Any more fancy plans I should know about? #8221;  #8220;I mean, Mitchell and I were thinking about trying to do the creaky-floorboard thing in the saloons tonight to remind people about the fireworks, but that's not, you know. The same thing. #8221; Dale nodded at me and went back to his paperwork. I was on my way out when I saw him reach into his bottom drawer. I don't think he noticed me, but I still wanted to scream. The Dale I knew ten years ago wouldn't have kept a bottle of whiskey in his desk. Hell, the Dale I knew ten years ago barely drank beer. The second stagecoach robbery went off great. I found out Leah knows just enough about horses to drive a stagecoach, at least provided its original driver is right there to keep the horses from freaking out. She and Oliver leaped up alongside Mitchell, and I'm not entirely sure it wasn't planned to keep me out of the driver's seat again, because as soon as they did Oliver yelled me to the back to get up on the same signal bar Leah rode earlier. Also, Leah's a fucking speed demon. I never knew you could have a lead foot with horses, and I *really* don't ever want to see it again. We closed down Twin Vale around eight-thirty. Or more correctly, we started doing the rounds to remind people about the fireworks at eight-thirty, and then we were free to head to Hollywood if we wanted to see them ourselves. I'm pretty sure absolutely nobody was crying about getting off 90 minutes early and still getting paid for it. I certainly wasn't, anyway. It felt weird, heading into Casablanca in costume while the park was open. It looked about like I remembered from the Fourth I worked the bar #8212;three bartenders, all with open black bowties and white sleeves rolled up to their elbows, shaking and pouring and pulling taps, all but running to keep up, every tabletop in the dining service area full. I wandered up, fished a five out of my onstage wallet, and slid it across. I was answered by one of the female bartenders, whose nametag said  #8220;Alex #8221; and who reminded me in some vague way of an old movie star. Not just because we were in Hollywood, either, it was something about the face. Maybe her makeup.  #8220;How much for something that looks like whiskey and isn't a damn house? #8221; She kind of laughed and tried to push my five back.  #8220;I've got a julep made with coffee. You know you don't have to pay in here. #8221;  #8220;That's very nice of you. Keep the five. #8221; And then I watched her literally tuck it in her half-buttoned shirt. She picked the wrong person to try it on, but she pretty obviously knew how to pull in tips. I used to have a trick for tips, too. The short version is, there comes a certain age where you can call a woman  #8220;miss #8221; instead of  #8220;ma'am #8221; and suddenly you have a new friend who wants to give you money. I ended up putting another five on the bar just for the effort, so I guess it worked after all. You can't count on people to tip on holidays, especially when it's busy and they think they've had to wait five seconds too long. Out of the four main plazas in the park, Hollywood is easily the prettiest. Almost the whole thing is built out of movie references #8212;the lampposts are from Singin' in the Rain, the fountain is a model of one in Central Park that gets used in movies a lot, the clock above the plaza is modeled after the Big Ben face even though it's not in a tower, and there are lights in the trees. At some point in the last ten years, a decent chunk of the brick cobbles were taken up and replaced with Hollywood stars, too. They're blue instead of pink, probably because of copyright or something, but they're there, a perfect ring around the edge of the plaza. I don't recognize all the names, but I'd bet Dale picked them himself, and he didn't need Wikipedia for it, either. I was standing on the steps of Casablanca with my coffee julep, watching the crowd and feeling just a little smug to be standing on its front steps after what I learned last week, when Dale popped up next to me.  #8220;I wondered if you'd be out here. #8221;  #8220;I used to wonder the same thing about you, every year. #8221; There was an awkward silence, and then he said no.  #8220;I'm surprised. #8221; Dale shook his head.  #8220;The first Fourth I spent as the manager here was the one where I dragged you out from behind the bar to watch with me. After that . . .  #8221; His eyes met mine, and I was surprised to see he looked sober.  #8220;You told me it was the first Fourth you'd ever celebrated. It . . . seemed wrong, after that. To be out here. #8221;  #8220;It was. The first one, I mean. My family celebrated Juneteenth instead. #8221;  #8220;So this . . . . is your second one? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, basically. #8221; We stood on the stairs for a few minutes while I finished my julep. I put the glass down on one of the trays by the doors. Alcohol usually doesn't leave Casablanca, but there are exceptions for firework nights. Some people just want to watch with a beer in their hand.  #8220;Nothing to drink? #8221;  #8220;I had one earlier. #8221;  #8220;That's it? #8221; There was one of those pauses you get when someone's trying to put something into words, and while Dale put things together I heard a hiss, and a click, and then  #8220;I've Been Everywhere #8221; started playing over the Hollywood plaza speakers. He finally picked up again about the time Johnny Cash started rattling off state names.  #8220;I really let myself go to hell after what happened to you. Maybe if I hadn't, I could've found a way to help you sooner instead of having to wait and rely on someone else. #8221;  #8220;Okay? #8221;  #8220;And now someone else is hurting under my watch, because I fucked up. I've already determined Leah's turning is outside the contract. I can help her, or at least try, as long as it doesn't come into direct conflict with the rules I'm bound by. #8221; He met my eyes again. His looked watery, like he was trying not to tear up because then the bawling would start entirely outside his control.  #8220;Giving up and letting somebody else clean up my mess the first time was chickenshit. Doing it again would just be a fucking insult to you. #8221; He looked over the plaza.  #8220;If I'm going to help you help her, I have to get my shit together. Getting drunk isn't a luxury I can afford right now. #8221; Taking his hand was probably stupid, but there's some things, when you know somebody well enough, you can say better without words, and I think *thank you* is one of them. We ended up getting slowly pushed down the steps by people leaving Casablanca, crowding the plaza to the tune of Party in the USA. I saw a few sparklers going off on the cobbles #8212;the nice thing about Hollywood is, there are so many nooks and crannies in a basic big open space, you can cram a whole lot of people in the plaza and still be spread out. The crowd was getting louder, though, the same kind of louder you hear when you're at a concert and the band's about to come on but the lights aren't down yet. I felt my phone go off in my wallet, and glanced around to check for little kids before pulling it out. It was Leah, crammed into the Pied Piper window with Anne and Maxine, all three sticking their tongues out at the camera. *You coming up? View's great.* *I'm in Hollywood with Dale.* What I got back was an entire line of emoticons I couldn't decipher. *English, please?* More emoticons. At least these ones were all winking and blowing kisses, which translates just fine back over a decade. I rolled my eyes. *Don't be a jerk. Enjoy the fireworks.* I paused. *Don't forget to put your fountain back when you're done being idiots in the window.* I know I couldn't actually hear her laughing all the way from Hollywood, but it sure felt like it. Dale glanced over at me.  #8220;Everything okay? #8221;  #8220;Just Leah being obnoxious. #8221; Dale snorted. Then he squeezed my hand. When the fireworks started, I squeezed back.

    <TEXT>To go with what /u/girl-from-the-crypt said, I made myself an actual multilevel blueprint/planogram for Stagecoach Driver. It is in NO way, shape, or form canon (although it includes all the canon structures), but if you #8217;d like it, I can try to photograph it and upload it. I will warn you it #8217;s quite large and there are spoilers on it, though.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me plan my commonwealth-wife settlement layout?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-03 04:38:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So having determined that Conquest basically fried my game, I had to go back to the point where I left the Vault and start over. So, this question comes with a blank slate. I want to build an actual this-could-be-an-economy Commonwealth, rather than  #8220;every settlement has the same damn thing. #8221; So one might have just enough to feed the settlers there but predominantly focus on pottery and carpentry manufacture, a coastal one might be full of fishers, one would be a trade center, a couple others would be nothing but food, one would be for mining, one would focus on alcohol brewing, etc. and all, of course, connected by a trade route. (Yes, I have mods for all this, including one that lets me assign 12 food per settler.) I would also like this to be logical-looking, like each settlement #8217;s industry makes sense given its location and available resources. Other than  #8220;Sanctuary is clearly the trade center due to its distance from Diamond City and size, #8221; where would you guys put each industry, and why?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Furious [Part Seventeen]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-03 13:35:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Sixteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gc5kl0/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) Sorry for another gap in reporting in, guys. Things have been happening here for the last couple of weeks, but none of them have really had to do with anything. It's more like  #8220;stuff happens, when you're alive. #8221; I'll share a couple of them just to get you caught up with me. Dale found a box in the back of the closet when he was trying to find a pair of workboots, and when he opened it he found out it was mine. Apparently he packed it full of stuff of mine he couldn't bear to throw out and couldn't stand to look at, which means I have a lot of my important stuff back, or, well, the kind of stuff that's important to you when you're twenty years old and broke as hell. Half a dozen band T-shirts, some CDs, my good copy of the Silmarillion, some photos. For starting my life over from a single box, it's a pretty nice little treasure trove. Leah told me to consider her spare bedroom mine, at least until we can get her turning reversed. I'm still on an air mattress, but with my stuff back #8212;including a couple of Dale's old photography projects on the wall, the ones he couldn't stand and I thought belonged in a damn museum #8212;it feels like having an actual home again, albeit one with a very noticeable missing presence. I have a scripted line now for girls who want to ask for my phone number while I'm in costume. Caroline and Oliver apparently have the same problem, but I have an advantage they don't, which is that it's completely in character for me to not know what a phone number is, or, for that matter, a phone. I got a real laptop with my last paycheck. I've been scanning in Dale's park documents #8212;the old blueprints, the purchase orders, everything from the file he gave me. It hasn't really turned up anything, but I can do stuff like laying blueprints overtop of each other to see the park in 3D now. I ran into a little kid in the park the other day who told me when she grows up she wants to be a ballerina astronaut cowboy princess ninja doctor. Not all of these things at some point, mind you, she wants to be all six at once. I told her when I grow up I want to be a train engineer but instead of a train whistle I'll just stick my head out the window and yell really loud, and she giggled until she fell on her butt, and then just kept giggling from the ground. The kids in this job are a trip and a half. I'm actually kind of glad I didn't end up back in Casablanca at this point, although I'm never going to say so out loud, just in case upper management gets any ideas. At least three people who've seen Maxine and me in the same spot have asked if we're siblings. We don't even look alike. At this point we're just kind of laughing about it, because what else can you do. Oliver bet me fifty bucks I wouldn't ride the drop tower in the horror section. It's nowhere near the biggest one in North America, but it's still 175 feet tall, and I'm not afraid of heights but I'm not a huge fan of them, either. Mitchell and Maxine decided to get in on the bet, which ended with me throwing up as soon as I got off and then staggering over to Leah's little corner of horror with a hundred and fifty bucks it only took me about two minutes to earn. We decided to use it to order something incredibly fancy for dinner and ate in her studio that night after park close. I broke the only-hand-to-hand-contact rule without thinking about it when a kid fell off the hitching rail outside one of the gift shops and busted his face. Dale told me he'd let it go because the kid was covered in blood and I was trying to figure out if he had a head wound. (It turned out to be a tooth he knocked out on the edge of a barrel.) He did tell me he had to give me at least a verbal warning for it because the rule is in place to prevent lawsuits and he had to do the same with me as he would anyone else, and I told him that was fine, but I'd take the warning over watching a kid sit and scream while his mom waited for first aid help to come any day. He told me that was about what he expected. Six different staff members have asked for my biscuit recipe and only one's gotten close to replicating it. They're all assuming I have some secret family ingredient I don't tell them about. The sad truth is, I actually got the recipe from the Betty Crocker cookbook and it's just that none of them can follow directions. Anne asked *incredibly* shyly if I know how to make ratatouille. I said yes, like a complete liar, because she's adorable, and then I went home and looked up some recipes and I have no idea how I didn't learn this years ago. We had a pre-open lunch with my first shot at it, and Leah and Darius both decided I should be on Masterchef. I showed up to one of these pre-open lunches and found Maxine sitting on Leah's lap and giggling, and Darius sitting on Maxine's lap and giggling, so I sort of shrugged and sat on Darius' lap, and then Oliver came in and sat on my lap, and then Anne sat on Oliver's lap just as Dale walked in and the whole damned stack of us fell over with our legs around each other, laughing like hell. Dale just said  #8220;it's too early for this shit #8221; and walked back out, and we all laughed harder, and then Leah made a crack about what if Dale sat on Anne's lap, and I shouldn't be allowed to speak before food and coffee in the morning because totally without thinking about it I said  #8220;he's 250 pounds, I don't feel like being under that today #8221; and in the resulting pandemonium I also said it was too early for this shit and ducked out. Caroline promised me brownies if I came back. To her credit, she did actually bring brownies the next day. I don't think they came out of a box, either. It's been four days and Anne still can't look at me without cracking up, but Oliver's stopped wolf-whistling at me, so there's that. I also still don't know what the tower of lap-sitting was for, by the way, just if you're wondering. Oliver found out somewhere I thought he was hot, and I kind of panicked and tried to apologize, and he just gave me the most confused look I've ever seen and said something that kind of caught me off-guard:  #8220;You're allowed to be a human being, you know. #8221; Then we spent five or ten minutes going back and forth over whether I was out of line, and he finally called an end to it by telling me he didn't care if I was gay, he'd care if I was a creep, and there's nothing inherently creepy about having eyeballs. I'm starting to get my head around the idea that  #8220;gay people are people #8221; happened while I was gone, but  #8220;and straight people don't care #8221; is still blowing my mind.  #8203; Also I get the impression he kind of wants to punch my dad now, but a lot of people want to punch my dad, so that's nothing new. And that brings us up to today. Like I said, all random life-happens-while-you're-alive stuff. Today, though, I cornered Oliver while he was letting the Diva out and said  #8220;hey, wanna come spend some unsupervised time in an abandoned bunker? #8221; I don't think human beings can actually perk their ears the way dogs can, but he sort of gave the impression of doing that anyway.  #8220;Are there bodies? #8221;  #8220;Not that I know of? #8221;  #8220;Is there actual light in there? #8221;  #8220;I brought flashlights. With wrist straps. #8221;  #8220;Are we gonna get attacked by random shit again? #8221;  #8220;Hopefully not. #8221;  #8220;I'm in. #8221; We got to the Twin Vale cellar by ten-thirty, and when I handed Oliver his flashlight and headed down the steps he peeked his head in and shook it before following me. We shined our flashlights around, and I filled him in on how I'd first found the place. The cellar is small, maybe six feet by eight feet, with regular concrete walls and a few of those aluminum industrial shelving units around. Oliver pinned one of the shelving units with his flashlight.  #8220;That's painted. #8221;  #8220;Huh? #8221;  #8220;Listen. #8221; He walked up to it and knocked on one of the shelves. I was expecting a metallic *clank.* Instead I heard a solid and distinctly wooden *thunk.*  #8220;Why paint it to blend in? Why not just leave it alone? Nobody's going to care about mismatched shelves in a storage space. #8221; He stared at it a minute longer, then peered between the shelves before reaching back to knock on the wall. It wasn't wall. It was a shelf-back, painted to look like concrete, and it sounded *hollow.*  #8220;There's something back here. #8221; Oliver nodded me up to the painted shelf, and between us we pulled it forward enough to see a black, door-shaped hole behind. We looked at each other.  #8220;Are we going in there? #8221; Oliver looked uneasy. I didn't know if I looked it, but I sure felt it. Neither the cellar, nor any empty space attached to it, appeared on the park blueprints. Any of them.  #8220;Stick something between the shelf and the wall so we can get back out. #8221; Oliver looked around, then pulled out his car keys and set them on the ground. He glanced up at me.  #8220;I put an iron ingot on there after what happened this winter. #8221;  #8220;Good idea. #8221; I wanted to point out his car keys wouldn't help much if something, or someone, decided to take a more traditional approach and just blockade the shelf, but we had enough problems without adding to them. The hole turned out to be a hallway. A manmade one, too #8212;still floored and walled with concrete, with wooden beams for weight balance. I was about to ask Oliver *why not steel?* when the concrete abruptly ended, and the hallway turned into an open alcove walled with dirt, and I thought I might pass out. In all these years, it never occurred to me to wonder where Warin's enclosure was, until I was standing in it. The alcove had to be set right below Twin Vale's main plaza. There was a dark pool of water on one side I wouldn't have taken a drink from if I was dying of thirst #8212;it smelled *stale,* and dangerous in a way I'm not sure I could describe if you gave me a lifetime to do it. The room was lit #8212;albeit dimly #8212;by these weird tendrils I thought might be bioluminescent plants, although how any kind of plant could survive here was beyond me. Some kind of moss or lichen living on the wooden support posts, maybe. Or maybe something from the Underground. And all around the walls, pictures. Hundreds of them. Some were black and white, and odd sizes that became more understandable when I saw them up close #8212;a woman with light, probably-gray hair, wearing a long-sleeved and long-skirted dress, looking adoringly at a tall, spare man in glasses, sitting at a piano. The same couple on a stage. A newspaper clipping, showing them on the steps of the Bijou Theatre. Grace and Robert. There were two or three of a young woman who looked remarkably like Leah, but her hairstyle and clothing made it clear she was someone else, from long ago. There were angry X's drawn over her photographs. I spotted a row of promo pictures, an unimpressed blonde in a revealing nurse's costume circled in each. Half a dozen of the photos were Polaroids, taken from weird angles, the lighting patchy, like someone was learning how to use a camera. I'd seen another shot exactly like them in Dale's files #8212;Laila, taking her first and only set of park photographs. There were a whole slew of them that pissed me off to the point of rage, and you probably know exactly who was in them, but the reason I saw red and felt my hands shake had nothing to do #8212;well, almost nothing #8212;with my face on Warin's walls. It was the composition #8212;weird angles, but more confident, the kind of thing a reviewer would probably call  #8220;a unique perspective. #8221; And a certain kind of intangible thing anybody who's a photo expert could probably tell you about #8212;the thing where you can just look at a photo and say  #8220;I know who took this. #8221; That, and a memory: *Fucking asshole isn't even supposed to be outside Twin Vale. Nate, did you grab my camera bag?* These weren't just photos of me. They were *stolen* photos of me. Dale never did find his bag, and he was way more upset about it than his dad could understand, given that his Nikon was in his hand when the bag came up missing. But I knew why: there was an entire roll of film in there he'd just finished, and our entire first day at the park together #8212;before I worked here, before Dale was even the manager #8212;was on that roll. The two of us on the carousel, me trying (and miserably failing) to win something at the Twin Vale shooting gallery, a mini-tripod shot in an offbeat corner with the park just visible behind us and Dale's signature framing separating us from it. I pulled a couple of the photos down before Oliver could see them. Dale hadn't exactly spent the entire roll at the park, if you get my drift.  #8220;There's a whole wall of Leah in here. #8221;  #8220;I'm not surprised. #8221; One of them was a newspaper clipping from the park centennial. Leah was near the front of the shot, laughing at the camera. Like Laila before her, she was circled in every group shot. Oliver looked between her photos and Laila's, and then at the wall I was standing in front of, still furious but also kind of shocked just how many of the photos *hadn't* been taken by Dale. One was in a frame, and I recognized it at once #8212;he and I both had a copy, and he'd kept his on his desk. His dad had taken it, the two of us sitting on the bench under the weeping willow by the front office and laughing at each other. It was the one Leah mentioned in her blog, and I yanked it off the wooden post it'd been attached to. The asshole didn't have a right, not to any of us, but splashing the most private parts of our life together across his room like some kind of torture porn *really* tore it for me. Oliver frowned.  #8220;Hey Nathan? #8221;  #8220;Yeah? #8221; I was trying to sound calm, and kind of being grateful Warin was dead, because if he wasn't I would've killed him, and that *really* wouldn't have gone over well with upper management.  #8220;Why's everybody circled in group pictures, but when it's just you and Dale together there aren't any circles? #8221;  #8220;Because he #8212; #8221;  #8203; I stopped. Oliver was right. When Grace was pictured with a second person who wasn't Robert, she was circled. When Robert was shown next to her in a picture with what I assumed to be the rest of the family, they were circled. Leah and Laila were both in group pictures, and circled. There was a photo of me as part of a formal lineup at Casablanca, and I was circled. But the shot of Dale and me on the carousel #8212;no circle. The one in the little odd corner #8212;no circle. The only time any of us pretenders weren't circled was when we were alone in the picture, or standing with another pretender and *only* another pretender. Leah's blog about Dale's scars, his name scrawled desperately all over himself with a knife, slammed back into my head. *He just barely got out.* For some reason, Warin decided not to take both of us. Maybe because he thought it'd be more fun to watch Dale suffer. Or maybe because he planned to take both of us at separate times, and Dale got one step ahead of him by making himself literally unforgettable. Part of me wanted to yank all the photos off the walls and run out with them. Another part recognized how wildly impractical that would be, but most of me was just . . . spinning. In shock, I guess. Oliver touched my shoulder, and I jumped.  #8220;We'd better get back out of here, #8221; he said.  #8220;We know what it is now. It'll still be here after park close if you want to, you know . . .  #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; We left it, but I still didn't want to. I was clothed in the photos I left up, but somehow I felt more naked leaving them there. I handed Oliver the framed photo.  #8220;Do me a favor, would you? Do you have time to run this to Dale before you have to get dressed? #8221;  #8220;Probably not, but I have to cut through Candyland and I can give it to Madeleine. #8221;  #8220;Please. #8221; I watched him head off before I went to get changed. I wasn't able to go back after park close #8212;I mean, I could have, in theory, but after ten hours running around with kids all I wanted to do was check on Leah and go home. But I want to go back. I want my damned pictures. And I want to find out who the girl is in the crossed-out photos.

    <TEXT>In Japan, dinner service is usually part of the experience for non-corporate hotels, and you must tell the staff whether you #8217;ll be in for the meal, as it #8217;s several courses long. If the man was specifically referred to as an  #8220;innkeeper, #8221; then this was probably a ryokan, and the disappearance would have been noted with disapproval at dinner and concern by morning, when his futon hadn #8217;t been used.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It helps to pinpoint his disappearance, too. Missing a meal without saying you #8217;re dining elsewhere is rude, but Japanese culture highly values conformity and routine. Missing dinner AND sleep AND breakfast at a hotel whose room you have purchased can only be the sign of either a terribly-raised person, or a total disaster, by Japanese standards.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Walking Disaster [Part Eighteen]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-05 14:37:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Seventeen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gcqorl/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; \[\[TW: sexual themes of a noncon kind.\]\]  #8203; I quit asking for help when I was ten years old. My social studies teacher said on Wednesday she'd give a very nice amount of extra credit to anyone who could memorize all fifty state capitals by the start of class on Friday. I'd bombed a test near the beginning of the year and wanted to make up the points, so I took on the challenge, which is a lot harder to pull off in 48 hours than it sounds. At some point on Thursday evening I told my dad I was having problems. His response was  #8220;Nathan, meditate on the Lord, and he will help you. #8221; I thought I was being logical when I said  #8220;Jesus don't know the state capitals, Dad, he's from Galilee. #8221; But in my dad's eyes, I was simultaneously mouthing off and limiting the Holy Spirit, both of which were huge no-gos in our house. I didn't get the extra credit. I was at home, trying to find a halfway-comfortable way to sit, and reading the Bible to find a miracle to write an essay about for my dad. After that I decided it was better to just figure things out for myself. Even when I was living with Dale, who probably would've figured out how to build a damn rocket if I asked him to bring me a star, I had to sort of come up sideways on asking for anything as simple as help with the dishes. I've never really stopped being that way. I was ready to sit on my ass and rot forever in the park rather than accepting Leah's help, and that should probably tell you a lot. I'm not telling you this for pity, by the way. It's just that I really need you to understand how unintentional this was. Also, it's incredibly embarrassing. But I promised to be honest, so just know you can't possibly judge me any harder than I'm judging myself. We had another day of the worst possible weather yesterday, and this time it included hail *and* a tornado watch, because why the fuck should this year go halfway on *anything*, so Caroline picked up Maxine and Anne and me and took us to the park to spend the day with Leah, since it was closed. I was nervous about going until she told me she had a Jeep, but those things will drive through anything. The stick shift Dale taught me to drive on was a Jeep. I ran into a tree with it and the tree lost. In my defense, I'd never driven a car before where you didn't have to floor the gas just to get started. All of us took something to eat, which in my case was rum babas. This is where my major mistake started, because in addition to food Anne brought a bottle of Ciroc, and Caroline brought a bottle of whipped-cream-flavored vodka, and Leah apparently had like three entire boxes of hot chocolate mix stashed in her room. I've never been part of an all-girls' party before in my life, but apparently it involves movies, and giving a haircut to a shut-in, and a *lot* of alcohol. Also screaming with more glee than terror when there's lightning and the power goes out, at which point there's nothing much to do but sit with the window open for light while continuing to share drinks. I should probably tell you here that Dale and I are two very different kinds of drunk. He's the kind who asks questions like  #8220;do you think clouds ever get lonely, and when planes fly through it's like they're hugging them? #8221; and then starts crying because clouds don't have mouths and can't ever *tell* anyone they're lonely. I'm the kind of drunk who laughs a lot and can't stay on topic and tells you too much about his sex life right before trying to involve you in it, which is why I actually try to avoid alcohol most of the time.I didn't yesterday, which is where my mistake continued. Eventually the conversation turned to why we were all in the park on such a shitty day to begin with, and Leah said at least we didn't have to worry about Warin showing up, since he was free-roaming, because she'd worry he'd try accelerating the process again. I'm perfectly capable of making the decision to shut up when I'm drunk. At least, in theory. In practice, I don't think I've made the decision to shut up while drunk ever, even once, in my entire life.  #8220;What I don't get, #8221; I told her, and I remember telling her this but not whether I'd forgotten Maxine and Anne were there or if I'd just decided it didn't matter,  #8220;is why he kissed you, but *I* got to drink something he spit in. I'm not sure if that's racist or homophobic or both. #8221;  #8220;Maybe it was like that one Egyptian myth, #8221; Caroline said.  #8220;With the god who put his come on a salad and got another one of the gods to eat it #8212; #8221;  #8220;*Excuse* me, the only come I've ever swallowed in my life was #8212; #8221; Leah covered my mouth. I really don't think I can explain to you how much I love her sometimes. Of course, eventually she had to move her hand.  #8220;You know what? I'm going to go with racist, because the stupid motherfucker had *my naked pictures* hanging over his fucking *bed* and he doesn't get to jack off to my face and then say he doesn't like gay people. #8221; Have you ever seen one of those movies where something happens that's so drastic there's a literal record scratch, and then everyone all turns to stare at one thing, all at the same time? I had no idea that could happen in real life. I've also never heard four completely different responses so perfectly add up to  #8220;what the fuck? #8221; before. Caroline went with  #8220;your *what?* #8221; while Leah went with  #8220;he had a *bed?* #8221; and Maxine chipped in with  #8220;he *what* now, #8221; but the absolute winner went to Anne, who's about five-nothing and chubby with actual ringlets and looks like she ought to be one of Santa's elves, who spit out  #8220;the sick bastard stole your fucking *nudes?* #8221; I don't think I've ever heard Anne swear before. Maxine actually grabbed her phone and took a picture of my face. It'd be hilarious, if I didn't know what was happening when I made it. I spent a couple of minutes on a loop of  #8220;you *swore*, you dropped an actual *f-bomb,* holy shit Anne you *swore* #8221; before Caroline nudged me back toward explaining what *exactly* the fuck I meant by naked pictures and Warin's bed, and I told them about the cellar in Twin Vale and the pictures on the walls. I'd been spending a couple hours a day down there trying to pull them all down, but there were a lot more than I'd thought at first, at least a couple thousand, and it was taking forever. I think I tried explaining the thing with Dale's camera bag at least three times. None of them quite seemed to get why it was so important to me. To be totally fair, *I'm* not sure why it's so important to me, except maybe that Dale's photography was something of his that was untouched by the park, something that was *just* his, and Warin had to take that too. Eventually I got bored with trying to explain the photos and told them about the Jim Crow theatre. Leah chimed in with an empty passage she found in the arcade over in horror, and how she thought possibly at one point it was a haunted house, and the subject moved on. And that could have been where it ended, except for one thing: Apparently, no matter how much alcohol you drink or how susceptible to it you were when you were fully human, if you're even part pretender, you can't get drunk, and Leah likes to *fix* things. Which is why, when I turned up at work this morning with literally the worst hangover I've had in my entire life, consoling myself that I'd have a couple of hours in dark and solitude to recover #8212;and possibly the chance to vomit on Warin's floor #8212;I instead found myself met with Anne, Maxine, Caroline, and Darius. The girls had already heard the story. Darius didn't know most of it, but he knew he needed to come hold a bookshelf open, and not one of the four was willing to let me refuse.  #8220;Leah'd be here too if we thought it'd be safe for her to go down there, and you know it, Nathan, #8221; Maxine told me.  #8220;We're going to finish it today if it takes us right up to open. #8221; Anne looked at least as hungover as I felt, so at least it wasn't *just* me, and we were mostly silent until we were in the dirt alcove. Maxine wrinkled her nose.  #8220;Smells like a damn tar pit in here. #8221;  #8220;Smells like his spit in here, #8221; I told her, and started pulling down photos again. Caroline put a box on the floor for us to toss pictures in, to be sorted later. I'd already started leaving a few bare patches on the walls, but with the girls helping it was like watching one of those long-exposure films where you can watch a flower bloom in 30 seconds. Maxine bent over near the pool, and I had the thought I should probably grab her before she could fall in #8212;because who knows what's in there #8212;and then she stood up with something in her hands.  #8220;Nathan? I think I found something, #8221; she said, and then I heard a zipper and then a startled *oh* and then she pushed the thing into my hands.  #8220;Maybe you better be the one to go through this. #8221; It was Dale's camera bag, and other than a few black stains, it looked exactly like it had when it came up missing.  #8220;Holy shit, he had like three thousand dollars in lenses in here, he's gonna be so what the *fuck.* #8221; There was another roll's worth of photos inside, none of them the kind you'd put on your parents' piano. Certainly not ones I knew had been taken. And completely lacking in the crisp clarity signature to Dale's photos. These almost looked like the person taking them had never used a camera #8212;kind of jittery and dark. In a few of them a finger was visible at the bottom, and after a couple seconds it hit me what the weird glare in the corners was: Dale's office window. You don't need to know exactly what the photos were. If I tell you we were both nineteen and stupid and ever so slightly adrenaline junkies and that Maxine decided they were private after a single glance, that's probably enough context for you to figure it out on your own. What you *do* need to know is that they were taken from outside the office, and that I knew exactly what day this was, and when, and that I could confidently say absolutely nobody else was in the park at six in the morning, not even maintenance. Well. Except one person, who strictly speaking didn't even have to sleep.  #8220;Where did that son of a bitch get a camera? #8221; I didn't even realize I'd said it out loud, but all three of the girls stopped what they were doing, and Anne actually asked what I was talking about before Maxine touched her shoulder and said something too low for me to hear. I zipped the bag up so fast I thought I broke the zipper, and almost started crying before deciding my head couldn't take it. Caroline touched my shoulder.  #8220;Do you want to take the bag to Dale, and we can finish up down here? #8221; I really, really didn't. Strictly speaking, I know I didn't do anything wrong. Warin stole the rolls of already-taken pictures, and apparently a camera; Warin chose to intrude on us being a pair of dumb fuckstruck teenagers. But if I gave Dale the bag I'd have to tell him about where I found it, and what else I found there, and the idea of telling him *by the way, somebody else saw the photos we took our first night in the apartment, the ones that were supposed to be yours, when you used to spend entire nights trying to convince me I wasn't going to hell for being human and we had our own little bubble in the world and it was small and simple but it was ours* made me sick to my stomach. I didn't actually say any of that, but apparently there's a specific facial expression that goes with it, because Caroline took my hand and tugged on it.  #8220;We can go together. There's not much left to do anyway. #8221; I pulled my hand away and shook my head, and she grabbed it again before reaching for my other one, too.  #8220;You've done so much for Leah. Just let us help you back, would you? #8221;  #8220;Do I have to? #8221; Caroline let out a squeak like she was trying not to laugh, for the sake of those of us still nursing our mistakes from the night before.  #8220;I think we'd appreciate it, yeah. #8221; I finally let her walk me to Dale's office. I spent the whole time trying to figure out in my head what I could say to him #8212;*the good news is, we found the camera bag, the bad news is what's inside it* #8212;but when we were finally standing in front of him I opened my mouth, shut it, opened it again, bit my lip, saw him give me this look like he thought I might be about to tell him someone died, and then just put the bag on his desk and started crying. Not particularly elegant, but it got the point across, I guess. I was pretty sure he recognized it, and I thought he'd open it to see what the hell was wrong now, but instead he got up and put his arms around me. There were slightly more arms than there should have been, and after a second it dawned on me Caroline was hugging me from the other side. I could tell they were talking over my head, or, well, Dale over my head and Caroline over my shoulder, but I was too busy being hysterical and hungover to actually take part in the conversation. Eventually Caroline gave my arm a squeeze, and then it was just Dale and me. It hit me suddenly that we were standing in front of the same fucking window, and I took a step out of its immediate line of view, dragging him with me by the waist. Which put us right in front of the open office door, and it's humorous now in this stupid dark kind of way, but at the time I didn't even think about the absurdity. Talk about locking the barn door after the horse. I have no idea how long we were standing in the corner, but by the time I finally slowed down from bawling to crying I felt like somebody'd driven a railroad spike into my head and Dale was covered in both tears and snot. He just kind of shrugged out of his button-down to the tee-shirt beneath it and kept on stroking my hair until I managed to start breathing like a normal person again.  #8220;Do you want to go through it before I open it? #8221; I just kind of shook my head. I didn't even give a shit if his camera lenses were in there anymore, and I'd been so excited to see the fucking bag when I remembered what was supposed to be in it I almost forgot my hangover for a minute. Dale pulled me over to one of the chairs in front of the desk and coaxed me into sitting before opening a desk drawer, pulling out an envelope, and opening the bag. He shuffled the photos into the envelope and tucked the envelope closed before holding it up.  #8220;Do you want me to destroy them, or do you want to? #8221; I just shook my head again. There's a point, when you've been crying really hard, where it sort of feels like you're not exactly a person anymore. Things are happening, around you and maybe even to you, but none of it registers.  #8220;Do you want me to do it? #8221; I nodded, but more because the idea of someone else doing something so I didn't have to sounded as good as anything could in that post-bawl state. I heard a *thwack* I was pretty sure was the envelope being tossed on his desk, and then he sat down in the chair next to me. I think I actually dozed off while he was making a phone call, because I thought I only blinked but when I opened my eyes again Leah was standing next to me. I ended up not going on shift until five. Leah put me to bed in the castle and gave me a glass and a gallon of water, and woke up around four with a soft knock at the door. Caroline peeked in and asked how I was doing and if I wanted soup. My head still hurt #8212;still does, actually, and probably will tomorrow, too, it's been through a lot today #8212;but it wasn't trying to murder me anymore, and when I told her I didn't want to put her through the trouble she rolled her eyes and told me King Arthur's and Casablanca have the same soup recipes and repeated the question. I finally said yes to the soup because I thought it'd make her feel better, and when she was gone I sat up to have some more of the water and saw an envelope on Leah's bedside table with my name on it in Dale's handwriting. I opened it #8212;but carefully, it was taped instead of tucked and Dale never actually seals envelopes without good reason #8212;and found it was full of ashes. I think I actually smiled at it, kind of, before closing it again and tipping the whole thing into Leah's trash can. I washed my face and ate the soup Caroline brought and got into the park. I swear Twin Vale actually felt different, like some kind of infection in it had been drained. I hope that's true.

    <TEXT>I mean . . . I'm not, really. I don't think I will be for a long time. But I'll learn to live with it. At least the bastard's dead now. And I checked in with Anne and Maxine, neither of them found anything questionable with Leah in it. I mean, other than the fact the photos were down there at all. So that's good.  #8203; I can't lie, I'm really grateful for Dale right now and I'm not even going to try to parse how I feel about feeling that way. We were both in those photos, he had every right to say he wanted to see what they were, but I'm pretty sure he actually torched them inside the first envelope he put them in. Kind of ironic, when you stop to think about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Leah texted me today and basically said this exact same thing. Oliver sent me this really hilarious text that said "Maxine just called me and told me to send you 'that done bullshit about oceans' and I think she meant John Donne saying 'no man is an island' so whatever that means to you, I'm supposed to tell you." Earlier I felt like I was never going to laugh again and for the last ten minutes every time I catch my phone in my line of vision I start. I'm not sure it's going to last long, but it feels pretty good, knowing I still can.  #8203; Dale checked in on me, too. Which is kind of unusual. He's made it kind of clear that he's not going to go chasing after me unless I invite him to follow. I'm guessing it hit him pretty hard, too, honestly. That equipment was his baby and it got turned into . . . that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm An Emotional Support Nathan [Part Nineteen]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-06 13:29:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Eighteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gdyvxh/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) Dale didn't come to work today. At first, we all thought maybe he was just coming in closer to call time; he's usually there by seven or eight in the morning, but sometimes he shows up at call at 11am, and sometimes even not until 11:30. But when noon rolled around it was Gary who unlocked the gates, and by two all of us were trying to reach him by phone. Days off happen #8212;we all take them, once in awhile, and Dale's no exception #8212;but pretty much never without him telling us he won't be in. By breaktime, I was ready to lose my mind. I asked over the walkie if anybody else had had any luck reaching him. The answer, of course, was no. Mitchell's been riding in with someone because his alternator died and he's got to get it fixed, but he offered to move into horror after the horses were put away if Darius could take me over to Dale's, so by nine we were on the road. Darius's car has a port where you can actually plug in your phone and play music, which I think existed when I landed on the stagecoach, but only for people way richer than me. Anyway, he plugged in and put on somebody named Bruno Mars. It's my first new music since the stagecoach, and I kind of get the feeling Darius knew that. It was mellow enough to help with my nerves, but not so quiet it put me to sleep. Granted, some of it hit pretty close to home, but what the fuck doesn't these days. We pulled up outside the apartment, and Darius cut the engine.  #8220;Do you have a key? #8221;  #8220;No, but I know where the spare is. #8221; Assuming Dale hadn't moved it, at least. Darius nodded at me. #8220;How long do you want? #8221;  #8220;I can text if it's going to be more than an hour? #8221;  #8220;Sounds good. #8221; He squeezed my shoulder.  #8220;Call me if you need help. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; The spare was still living exactly where I left it the last time I put it away a decade ago, but most of the rest of the apartment wasn't. I didn't really notice the last time I was here #8212;I was too busy being out of my mind scared, and later drained #8212;but at some point in the last ten years Dale stripped everything down to nothing. Pictures of the two of us were gone, which didn't surprise me, but the ones he'd taken and put into a triptych when he took his first and only trip to New York City were missing, too, and that did. The walls were noticeably bare #8212;even more, if you knew where to look for the nail holes. Dale was on the sofa, apparently passed out. The camera bag Maxine found in Warin's lair was sitting next to the coffee table, and what was left of its contents was spread over the table #8212;camera lenses, a couple of rolls of film carefully labeled in Dale's blocky handwriting, a small digital camera I remember someone in his family giving him. He used it twice, basically so he wouldn't look ungrateful, and then went right back to his Nikon. There were two bottles of alcohol on the table #8212;one the kind you might clean camera lenses with, and one the kind you might clean your insides with. The second one was a lot emptier than the first one, and when I got closer to the table I saw one of the lenses was cracked down the middle. Not an old-looking crack, either. No #8212;this looked more like Dale'd gotten way too involved in trying to clean them and damaged one. At first I thought the pink, raw scrapes on the backs of his wrists might have had something to do with damaging the lens, but when I took one of his hands to look at it #8212;just in case he'd been up to something more concerning #8212;I realized no, these were rub marks, not cuts. There was one on his shoulder, too, just visible around the neck of his shirt. He was breathing okay, so I took a look around to try to piece everything together. If Dale's anything, he's loyal to his commitments. I couldn't imagine him being late for anything less than an ambulance, either his or someone else's #8212;much less not showing up at all. It didn't take too long to figure it out. If anything, I wish it'd taken longer. Sheets stripped off the bed so violently the fitted one was all but shredded through one corner, multiple wet washcloths and a mostly-empty body wash bottle dripping in the tub, hand soap in the kitchen knocked into the sink, and a small pile of used cotton swabs on the coffee table near the camera lenses and a dish of rubbing alcohol. The ones near the bottom were covered in a thin layer of grunge and even a few small chunks of dirt, but toward the top they started looking cleaner, even unused. Dale isn't quite what you might call a neat freak, but the level of chaos he'd created apparently trying to get clean would drive him crazy under any other circumstances. I picked up the bathroom and tossed the top bedsheet in the washer with the blankets on the floor. The bottom sheet was a total loss, but it was plain white #8212;nothing that couldn't be easily replaced from another set. Then I headed back to the living room and tried to wake him. It took a couple tries, but when I finally got him awake he looked up at me like he couldn't figure out who I was. Eventually he blinked a couple of times and shook his head.  #8220;Nate? #8221;  #8220;Hey. #8221; In the way the world always works, I had the thought *no, it's Bugs Bunny* when this would've been the absolute worst time to use it. I've never quite been able to match his level of sarcastic comebacks because they never come to me at the right time.  #8220;Let's get this one out of the way first, how much did you have to drink? #8221; He looked embarrassed. And also at least mostly sober.  #8220;I don't know. #8221;  #8220;Any clue what time it is? #8221; He shook his head. I sat down next to him, and he immediately put his head down and squeezed his eyes shut. The danger of trying to move Dale anywhere is, he's literally almost twice my size #8212;he's got eight inches and over a hundred pounds on me. I've actually knocked myself over a couple of times doing things like trying to help him off the floor or pulling him off a stool. I almost did it again pulling his head onto my shoulder, but at the last possible second he realized we were going to topple over like a pair of very mismatched dominoes and grabbed the couch cushion to stop himself. And then he started crying. I knew it was coming. I just wrapped my arms around him and let him go. He'd done the same thing for me the day before, but with more snot. I'm a really ugly crier, but Dale is the kind who's mostly quiet and ends up with a case of the hiccups. I kind of wished there was a blanket on the sofa I could put around him #8212;I can get totally lost in one of Dale's hugs, but for the reverse, I need a little help. So instead I just squeezed as hard as I could and let him hold on. And thumped his back a couple times when the hiccups started, because sometimes that helps.  #8220;You need to talk? #8221; Dale shook his head.  #8220;You shouldn't have to clean up my bullshit. #8221; I rolled my eyes at him.  #8220;I'm sorry, are we both still speaking English? I don't think I asked if you need maid service. #8221; He almost laughed, but it got lost in another hiccup and shower of tears. Then he shook his head again.  #8220;This is my fault. You've got enough without dealing with my #8212; #8221; I have no idea the last time Dale heard anybody call him by his full name, but it's been long enough it actually made him stop and stare at me.  #8220;Seriously, Dale, I'm not here for the self-flagellation. You're allowed to feel like shit happened to you, *because it did.* I'm not the only one involved here. I'm going to ask this one more time and I'd appreciate an answer this time, do you need to talk? #8221; He swiped at his eyes. I found a box of kleenex on the end table and passed it to him.  #8220;I thought I knew just how much shit I put you through. I didn't know there was a whole other pile of it. #8221; He squeezed his hands together, and I took one before he could cut himself on his own fingernails.  #8220;I know why he was after you now. I can't tell you why. #8221; He stopped long enough to blow his nose and throw out the tissue.  #8220;But this had nothing to do with you and he had to drag you into it anyway. #8221;  #8220;You didn't see that room. I wasn't the only one with a stalker. All the pretenders #8212; #8221; Dale shook his head and tapped the table in front of the lenses.  #8220;This? This wasn't about you. This was entirely about me. You were his collateral damage. #8221;  #8220;Why? #8221;  #8220;I can't tell you, #8221; he whispered, and I just hugged him again. What else can you do, in a fucked-up situation like this? After a few seconds he started patting my arms.  #8220;Nate. I can't breathe. #8221; I let go.  #8220;Sorry. #8221; This time he really did laugh. It was watery, but it was real.  #8220;Absolutely nobody looking at you would believe you could squeeze a man to death. #8221;  #8220;Just part of my natural charm. Have you eaten? #8221; He nodded.  #8220;Yeah. I pulled out some of your spaghetti sauce. #8221; He pushed his hair out of his eyes.  #8220;Thanks for checking on me. #8221;  #8220;Thank you for yesterday. #8221; He kind of gave me this confused look.  #8220;For being my friend. #8221; I started laughing a little. I couldn't help it.  #8220;My fucked up, what the fuck are we doing, this should never work friend. #8221; He laughed back the same way.  #8220;Thanks for letting me be your friend. Even after everything. #8221; I squeezed his hand. He squeezed back.  #8220;Are you gonna be okay if I leave? #8221; He nodded and gestured toward the lenses.  #8220;I was going to clean this stuff up, and I . . .  #8221; He shrugged.  #8220;I don't know what happened exactly. I remember looking down at my fingers and seeing this black crap on my fingertips, probably mold, and going to the kitchen to wash it off, and then I just . . .  #8221; He shrugged again.  #8220;Snapped. #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221;  #8220;Do you need help making the bed? #8221;  #8220;No. #8221; He looked vaguely ashamed.  #8220;Not sure I want to sleep in there tonight. #8221; My phone buzzed. I pulled it out of my pocket and saw a text from Darius. I was going to send something back, like *give me a few minutes*, but Dale spotted the name and gave me this kind of sad smile.  #8220;Your ride? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; He nodded.  #8220;I'll let you go. I've put you through enough for the night. #8221;  #8220;You'd do the same for me, don't lie. #8221; Already had, actually, but I wasn't going to bring it up again. Instead I got up. He grabbed my hand.  #8220;Hey, Nate? #8221;  #8220;Yeah? #8221;  #8220;Thank you. For being my friend. #8221; I squeezed his hand one more time.  #8220;Thanks for letting me. #8221; Darius had something new playing when I got back in the car #8212;some girl whose name showed up on the digital display as Billie Eilish. He glanced over at me.  #8220;Everything okay? #8221;  #8220;As okay as it can be, everything considered. #8221; He nodded.  #8220;Hey, listen. I know it's late, but do you want to grab a burger or something before I take you to get your car? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, that'd be good. I had an early break today. #8221; We stopped at Denny's, because it was the only thing open, and swapped concert stories over cheeseburgers. He told me about going to see someone named Ariana Grande and the absolutely mortifying ordeal of her mistaking him for a child instead of a teenager, because she was his first major crush but he didn't actually get his first major growth spurt until he was 15. I told him about going to see My Chemical Romance and deliberately wearing the shirt I bought at the concert when I asked Gerard Way to sign it just so I could get him to touch me, because I was eighteen and trying to cram an entire replacement teenagehood into a couple of months. He laughed and called me cringey. I rolled my eyes and told him he was whack. Then he told me nobody says whack anymore, and I told him it's not my fault people don't know how to speak proper English, and we both cracked up. He ended up dropping me at Leah's instead of back at the park. The good thing about Denny's is, they're open 24 hours, and if you lose track of time talking, you don't get kicked out. The bad thing about Denny's is, they're open 24 hours, and if you lose track of time talking, absolutely nobody is going to tell you it's one in the morning. I'd barely gotten out of the car when I got a text and heard a chime behind me. Darius pulled out his phone. It was Dale, in the employee chat: *seriously, 32 messages? Bill collectors don't call that much.* Maxine shot right back. *Maybe if you'd pick up so we didn't have to worry if somebody finally put a hit on you.* I sent him a series of raindrops emojis with a phone #8212;cry me a river and answer next time, basically #8212;and immediately heard Darius start laughing behind me and saw three different *NATHAN NO* texts come in all at the same time. There was a significant pause in the chat while I tried to demand Darius explain the joke. Then Dale texted again. *I'm going to do you the favor of assuming you have no idea what that's used for, and ignoring it.* Darius finally got himself under control enough to explain before he headed out, laughing and shaking his head at me in his rearview. I decided to be petty and answer Dale entirely in leetspeak. Somehow, Mitchell was able to read it. Everyone else was mystified, though, and that was fine by me. I got a separate, private text from Dale as I was opening the door. *You okay?* *Yeah. Just tired. You?* *Hungover. It's been a few weeks, I thought I'd try it out again.* *And?* *Not my best decision.* I saw the little dots on the bottom of the text window and waited. Two minutes passed, and then he sent me *I'll see you at work tomorrow.* I almost asked what he'd been typing all that time, but knowing Dale, I could go in circles for hours and never find out. Instead I said okay, and goodnight, and plugged my phone in and flopped on the mattress before texting Leah. *Hey, you never told me what you wanted for lunch tomorrow and it's your turn.* I was almost asleep when she texted back *CREPES* all in capital letters and then said goodnight. So now I'm just trying to fall asleep. It's going to be a long time coming, I think. It's hard, feeling this way and knowing there's absolutely nothing you can do #8212;no law to invoke, no warning you can give, not even a living face to punch. I'm just going to have to hope it gets better. [Part Twenty](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gfskdp/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He was the very first person I thought of when I read the description of Nathan's eyes. I didn't use a picture from Holes, but we actually get to see him play a character from the Wild West period and just . . . perfect.  #8203; Sadly, for some of these folks--especially the ladies--we'd have to find lookalikes. Dul #233; Hill and Ricki Lake look NOTHING like this anymore, Olivia Newton-John is now old enough to play the Aging Diva herself (actually, she's that perfect mix of beautiful and "your star has faded" to do it), and Gloria Swanson passed in 1983. (Although if you want to see her play *an* aging diva, if not *our* Aging Diva, look up a movie called Sunset Boulevard. It's wonderful and fantastic and sad, and is a true example of "they just don't make 'em like this anymore.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do pop culture conventions. Some of the people I've met would make you lose your mind, and I don't say that to be name-droppy, either. It's just I've been doing this so long.  #8203; Doug is one of those people where somehow I manage to always miss his movies but they're always movies I want to see, and it drives me bonkers.

    <TEXT>Ohhhh. Yeah, that #8217;s way different from here. COVID has postponed or cancelled five conventions within what we #8217;d consider  #8220;a reasonable drive if you stay the night #8221; (about six hours, I know, I know, it #8217;s crazy to Europeans) from me. And that #8217;s within a very small sub-sector of the US, AND we haven #8217;t even canceled or postponed all area cons yet. See if there #8217;s enough interest in your area to start one! It #8217;s a dicey proposition in the US, where we #8217;re already well-saturated, but if there aren #8217;t many in your area it could go well. Start small. Look at local comics shops, library programming (library cons are a great way to start), stuff like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My problem with Marcy is that she literally never has a single moment of not being horrible. Like, if you hang in Sanctuary long enough, you'll hear Jun have conversations with both Sturges and Mama Murphy--Sturges checking in on him, and Mama Murphy telling him that no, the Sight doesn't let her talk to the dead.  #8203; Marcy has no such conversations. You never hear her ask Sturges if the current defenses are enough, or say anything like "I miss him so much," or ask Jun how he's doing. She just stomps around being nasty and making comments that give no context to her life ("What, you think we're friends? Here's a tip, don't get close to anyone in this world if you don't like misery" as opposed to "What, you think we're friends? Because we're not," for example). If you didn't know she was Jun's wife, you'd literally never know she lost a child. They did a terrible job connecting her to her own storyline.  #8203; They even had an opportunity to let her open up to the Sole if you choose to save Mama Murphy. She'll blame you if you let her die, but if you save her? There's nothing like "maybe Preston was right to pick you" or "I guess I'll trust you. A little" or even a "kiss my ass." There's *nothing.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help! I need to fix a disappeared companion.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 08:53:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I had this problem with Curie before, and I'll tell you what happened this time around and then go back to how I tried (and failed) to fix it with Curie.  #8203; So I'm on survival but have SKK's console commands mod, and I might have cheated just a little bit and gone "fuck, I'm way too far east on the map and it's 5am and I don't want to have to walk all the way back to Sanctuary so I can save" and used console commands to port there. And by might I mean did. When I got there, Codsworth (my current companion) was gone. I figured I'd accidentally left him in the National Guard Training Yard, so I turned on the companion tracker to confirm, and . . . . he's gone. Nowhere on the world map.  #8203; Now this happened before with Curie (different file). I tried doing a placeatme to take myself to her, and it moved me like three whole feet (and she still wasn't there). I ended up doing a recycleactor and trying to add her back into my faction, but it just gave her generic dialogue and wouldn't let me re-recruit her, and the companion tracker still wouldn't find her.  #8203; I deeply enjoy my spicy English robot (and still need his perk). How do I get him back?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Goodness! Well . . . here, let me put it in perspective.

Alaska's bigger.)  #8203; As for big cons, I mostly do anime conventions, so my go-to would be Sabotencon, here in Phoenix. I can do you better with do-nots than dos: if it has "Comic-Con" in the name, it's going to be a ripoff. You pay to get in the door, then you pay to see specific guests, then you pay to go to specific events, then you pay to get autographs . . . and that's assuming you can even get in the door. Doing just about anything at SDCC or NYCC is almost impossible. You get in line at 9am for something at 3pm and hope you get in.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Running Out Of Time [Part Twenty]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 12:46:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Nineteen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gek10d/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Before anything else, let's get this out of the way: I'm not fired. I'm just suspended. It sucks, but it's like Dale said: he's not going to play favorites with me, and I actually respect that more than I would him giving me the slack. Although frankly, right now, me being suspended is the least of my worries. I guess I should explain all that, huh? Today didn't start out as a shitstorm. I brought soup and got to teach Madeleine a clapping game, because between Anne, Leah, and me, I was the only one who remembered most of the hand motions for a game all three of us called different things, but I grew up calling it  #8220;C.C. My Playmate #8221; and that's what I'm sticking with. I only taught her the first three verses. Anne wanted to keep going with the one about the BB gun, but there's some things kids Madeleine's age just don't need. Maxine's been learning to make bread and brought a side for the soup, and Oliver decided he was going to get in on this and bring salad. Not to brag, but Casablanca doesn't have anything on us. We sifted through some of the pictures from Warin's lair, picking out stuff Dale and Leah and I might want #8212;the old family photos, the news articles, and Mitchell made this super-dramatic gagging noise and said  #8220;get a room #8221; and frisbeed a photo at me of Dale and me sitting on one of the booths in the horror arcade #8212;him making the stupidest, worst-acted  #8220;help I'm terrified #8221; face in the world, me gnawing on his arm and trying to look menacing. There are some things that are permanently true, though, and one of them is that it's very hard to look menacing when you're nineteen and look like you're not old enough to drive without an adult. I think it's the first time I've laughed over any of the photos we found down there. Anne looked at it and asked if this is why I said I bite when provoked, which is right around the point Dale walked in with our paychecks, since he knows where we all go before call now.  #8220;I take it you told them about the mugger. #8221; The way this whole crew can just move in perfect unison without practicing it is a little eerie, honestly, especially when they all turn to look at me at the same time. I showed him the picture and shrugged.  #8220;Okay, so there was like this special screening or something of this movie Dale wanted to see down in the park, and we decided to hang out for awhile after it was over, and when we were leaving this guy decided he was going to pull a knife on Dale and take his wallet, and when Dale said he didn't have it the guy called us faggots and pushed him over and it pissed me off so I bit him. #8221; I didn't understand the facial expressions I got back from this story, but they were pretty epic, including Anne just slowly going  #8220; . . . you *bit* him? #8221;  #8220;Look, his arm was in easy reach, okay. #8221;  #8220;Nathan sent him to the hospital, #8221; Dale interjected.  #8220;He ended up needing eight stitches. And IV antibiotics. #8221;  #8220;Damn. #8221; Darius kind of gave me this look like he was waiting to see if I was going to go on a cannibalism spree. Madeleine applauded. I shrugged again. Teeth are a good weapon in a pinch, is all I'm saying. And it was a good morning. In fact it kept being a really good day right up until about three o'clock. And then Maxine and Anne both walkied in at the same time with horror stories from Candyland. Here's something you have to understand. We work with kids from babies to teenagers. Most of the time the teens kind of keep to themselves unless they're in horror, and the younger kids are pretty great. They can be a handful #8212;they're sugared up and running around with *rides* and *lights* and *real actual princesses and cowboys*, of course they're a handful #8212;but they're a *fun* handful, if you get me. They're there to have fun and they want us to make it fun. Sometimes you get accidentally smacked in the face by a kid doing an overenthusiastic photo pose or something, or you have to make up a fast excuse when a kid tries to hug you, but for the most part it's the kind of stuff you can laugh off and five minutes later you've forgotten all about it, unless it was particularly hilarious. Maxine has a lot of stories about kids bouncing off her hoop skirts. That kind of stuff. But once in awhile, you get a kid who makes you wonder if the Wild Ones are secretly sending changelings to the park just to fuck with you. The kid Candyland was calling about was one of those. According to Maxine, he'd asked for a picture and then deliberately tried to look up her skirt, and pushed her over when she pulled it around her legs. And according to Anne, he'd tripped the mime on purpose. According to both of them, his mom seemed to think it was hilarious. And he was headed for Twin Vale. Mitchell nodded me back to Second and asked if there was any good way to put up the horses mid-day. He was worried #8212;and as soon as he brought it up, so was I #8212;the kid might deliberately run in front of the carriage, and while the horses are about as perfect as you can get, at least during the day, there was still the risk they wouldn't be able to stop in time. We got the horses put up and agreed it'd be best to pull off our gunbelts, too. The props we carry are never loaded (except, very occasionally, with blanks), but they are real revolvers. And unlike modern guns that can use plastic for parts that don't get hot, these are made of nothing but metal and wood. A kid pulling one of those could do a lot of damage just by waving it around as a club. Mitchell pulled out his utility knife and added it to the pile of stuff we were leaving in the breakroom. I thought about it for a couple of seconds and decided to leave my phone #8212;Mitchell has one of those cases where you could do just about anything but light the thing on fire and it'd be safe, but I'm still trying to find one that does all that and fits my hand. Seriously, screw being  #8220;petite #8221; sometimes. I pulled my flask off my belt and tossed that on the table, too. Mitchell took a giant swig from his and then did the same. And then we headed back into the park. We both figured we might get hit, or pushed, but that'd be the end of it. Not pleasant, but not the end of the world. I had a kid in a wheelchair accidentally run over my foot at one point when he was pulling away from a photo, and that had to be worse than anything this kid could whip out on purpose. I was most of the way back to the main plaza when I heard a kid yell  #8220;hey mom, that cowboy's black! #8221; I get that reaction a lot. Usually from black kids who've never gotten to see a black cowboy, actually. It's not even all that surprising to me. I probably would've done the same thing at their age. Once in awhile it's some incredibly sheltered white kid, and if I turn around fast enough I can see the exact moment their parent gets really embarrassed and realizes this kid really needs to get out more. Either way, Mitchell and I have an agreement #8212;there's never even a hint I might be an outlaw when that phrase gets yelled, and since Mitchell's a sheriff, that means I'm usually on my own. So I turned around to tip my hat to whatever kid was the shocked one of the day, and then hit my ass straight in the dirt. Ah. Not just any kid. *The* kid. I opened my mouth to say something like  #8220;whoa there, partner, we don't do that kind of thing in Twin Vale, #8221; but before I could he smacked me in the face. So I tried getting to my feet instead, and got kicked in the leg hard enough to lose my balance, and then in the butt before I could try getting it again. I looked up hoping his mom might see somebody getting their ass beat by her kid and put a stop to it, but she was laughing and calling him  #8220;rambunctious. #8221; Some lady who looked absolutely disgusted with the mom reached her hand out to help me to my feet, and I took it. I'd almost gotten my balance when the kid jumped on my back, and I went down face-first. So I rolled before the kid could get out of distance again and grabbed his arm.  #8220;You, #8221; I told him,  #8220;are damn lucky you're not my kid. #8221; Apparently, this was enough for the mom to start screaming bloody murder. By then Mitchell was already headed in my direction at a run, yelling something into the walkie. I let go of the kid and kind of staggered to my feet, ready to go meet Mitchell, and got knocked to my knees *again.* I managed to get up, ready to call Gary and ask him to send park security, but before I could get my walkie the mom screamed at me to turn around, and when I did she had a taser pointed straight at my chest. I decided it'd probably be better to raise my hands than grab the walkie.  #8220;Ma'am, I would *seriously* appreciate if you'd put that thing away and tell your son to stop hitting me. #8221;  #8220;He's a *child*, and you *assaulted* him #8212; #8221;  #8220;Ma'am, that's a weapon and there's a crowd around here #8212; #8221; I saw her click the deployment button. And then the taser hit the ground, and the mom was holding her hand and screaming, and Leah #8212;who wasn't even remotely smiling #8212;stepped out between the buildings, her whip in her hand.  #8220;You could've killed him, you dumb bitch, #8221; she said, and there was something about both her tone and her language #8212;I've never head Leah say bitch, not even jokingly #8212;that made me take a closer look at her. Her eyes didn't look like Leah at all. I wasn't paying attention to whatever bullshit the mom was screaming #8212;or her kid, who was actually cheering for Leah. Not in some cute wholesome *wow I can't believe you hit that right out of her hand* way, either. Nice family. I didn't really care, though. I was more interested in finding the nearest post to sag against before I hit the ground again for reasons totally unrelated to being hit by a kid. And that was about when Dale came running up. I was pretty sure he'd actually run the whole way, too #8212;there was a patch of sweat between his shoulderblades and his face was red.  #8220;What in *hell* is going on here? #8221; I just shook my head. Leah was looking down at her whip like a wind-up toy that lost all its steam. Mitchell was the one who spoke up.  #8220;Kid knocked Nathan down and started beating the crap out of him, boss. Lady tried to tase him and Leah hit it out of her hand. #8221;  #8220;He didn't even yell, #8221; the kid said. He sounded disappointed.  #8220;I thought he'd yell. #8221; Dale looked at the mom.  #8220;Is that what happened? #8221; She started wailing about how I threatened her son, and she thought I was going to break his arm, and what kind of place was Dale running, anyway, the lady in the Candyland section got upset because he gave one of the actors a little push, too, and we should all be used to it by now, and that bitch with the whip could have killed her. On and on. You know the type, probably, if you work retail or you're around little kids ever. Although this kid wasn't exactly little. He had to be at least ten or eleven.  #8220;That isn't what happened, #8221; said the lady who'd helped me up.  #8220;That young man #8212; #8221; she pointed at Mitchell #8212; #8220;had it right. #8221;  #8220;I got it on video, #8221; said this kid I hadn't even noticed before. He looked like he was maybe fifteen or sixteen, with a faceful of metal and a gravity-defying green haircut. Dale sighed and shook his head.  #8220;Leah, Nathan, my office. Mitchell, if you wouldn't mind. Stop in Candyland on the way. See who made the complaint over there. #8221;  #8220;Both of the girls called over here, boss. #8221;  #8220;All right. Tell them they're wanted at the front. #8221; He turned to the kid with the piercings.  #8220;Don't suppose you could send me that video. #8221; I was about to head to the front when I realized Leah was still standing there. I reached out and grabbed her elbow. She shook her head and looked at me, confused.  #8220;Nathan? #8221;  #8220;We've got to go to the office. #8221; And then she said something that almost made me stop breathing.  #8220;Why am I in Twin Vale? #8221; I never knew that stupid suspense-novel line about your blood turning to ice in your veins could be a real feeling, but I got to experience it firsthand while I led her up to the office. We were met by Anne, Maxine, and Mitchell. And then we just waited, while Mitchell explained to the girls why Leah was there. Leah kept shaking her head, looking mortified.  #8220;I'd never use the whip on somebody, I hit myself a couple times when I was learning to use it and it hurt like crazy, I *wouldn't*. I would've gotten between you first. #8221;  #8220;We'll be talking about that. #8221; Dale, getting off the maintenance go-kart.  #8220;Leah, if you didn't have to stay here I'd be sending you home right now. I want to hear from all of you. Separately. What happened here. #8221; Mitchell went first. I just sat on the bench outside Dale's office. I could feel a bruise growing on my leg. Probably another one on my tailbone, too. That kid had to take karate. At some point Mitchell came out and Maxine went in, and while she was in I saw the mom and her kid, both still screaming, getting escorted out by security. If looks could kill, that mom would've sent me to the morgue with or without her taser. Anne went faster. She'd basically gotten the mime to his feet and hightailed it away from the kid before he could give Moth a reason to introduce him to his own insides by way of vivisection. Then Leah and I got called in. Leah started . . . I don't want to say babbling, but she was definitely talking fast, and all in a panic, before I could even open my mouth.  #8220;Dale, Mitchell said I *whipped somebody*, I don't remember, I don't even remember going to Twin Vale, I'd just put Mr. Scratch away and I was going to the roller coasters and then Nathan was talking to me *I don't remember #8212; #8221;* And then she started crying. Not a little bit, either. In between sobs I kept hearing her hiccup out  #8220;I don't remember #8221; again and again. Dale sighed and caught my eyes over her head. We both knew. It's just neither of us wanted to say it.  #8220;All right, #8221; he said, and if words were rocks you'd think he was lifting Mount Rushmore by himself.  #8220;Nathan, see if Maxine's still out there. If she is have her take Leah up to the castle. #8221; She was. I hugged Leah, and kissed her forehead. I was pretty sure at that point I was kissing her goodbye, and I was trying not to start bawling myself. Dale waited until the door was closed behind her before nodding at me to sit down.  #8220;You're damned lucky there's video, Nathan, or I'd have to tell you to go get your things. #8221; I just blinked at him. I was expecting the last four words of that sentence, but not what came before it. Dale sighed again.  #8220;Look. I understand your reaction. I really do. But you *can't* touch park guests. You can't. That isn't just a rule. It's a way to keep you out of trouble with the law. #8221;  #8220;So if I'm not fired, how much do I have to worry about? #8221;  #8220;Well, tasers are prohibited on park grounds, and we have two videos of her son assaulting you, one from another parkgoer and one from a security camera. And two people gave me their contact information in case she decides to press charges. Right now the question is whether she's willing to risk her own testimony getting turned around on her and landing her and her son in hot water. As for what you have to worry about from my end, you're not fired, but I can't turn a blind eye even though there were extenuating circumstances. If you'd only acted in self-defense, you'd be fine. But you grabbing the kid when he wasn't touching you is a problem, and I have to suspend you. #8221;  #8220;How long? #8221;  #8220;Three days. You won't be allowed on park grounds. I'll make sure Leah's taken care of while you're out. #8221;  #8220;What's going to happen to her? #8221; Dale looked bleak.  #8220;I'll give her the option if she wants to self-suspend or go back into the park. But if she's already losing her memory? Nate . . .  #8221; He met my eyes, and I saw tears standing in the corners of his.  #8220;She might be gone. #8221; I remember shaking my head at him, and telling him she wasn't, but I couldn't tell you how he answered me if you paid me. I know we went around about it for a couple of minutes. Finally he just shook his head at me.  #8220;I've got to send you off. Do you want me to send Gary after your things or do you want me to walk you back? #8221; I didn't think I could face Twin Vale, so I asked if Gary could get my phone and my flask. Dale called him on the park phone. Then he hugged me.  #8220;You'll be back in three days, #8221; he said, but we both knew he was saying it because he couldn't say  #8220;she'll be okay, #8221; and somehow that made it worse. He filled out my suspension paperwork while Gary got my stuff out of the breakroom. I signed it and got up.  #8220;Hey, Dale? #8221;  #8220;Yeah? #8221;  #8220;Thanks. For not firing me. #8221;  #8220;Don't do it again. I'm pretty sure the other actors would mutiny if I fired you over something like this, but some sue-happy parent would have a field day with your file if you turned up doing it over and over again. If something like this happens again, you do whatever you have to do to get away, but you don't engage. You're not going to get in trouble for breaking character to call for help. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; I've spent most of the night going over the park documents Dale gave me. I called Leah earlier, and she told me she took the suspension option. She sounded depressed as hell. I pulled the other actors and Dale into a group chat and asked if someone could take her some food if I cooked so she wouldn't have to eat in the restaurants while I was away if she didn't want to. There's some pretty great food in the park, but it can get old if you eat it all the time, and also I had the feeling losing access to food from home while we were both suspended would just make it worse for her. Mitchell's car is still out of commission #8212;I'm starting to think he'd be better off just getting a new one, I was around for this particular blowout and when his electrical system went all at once it was \*nasty #8212;\*and Anne doesn't drive, but everybody else volunteered. Leah's place is on the way to the park from both Dale's and Maxine's, so they're picking up for her, and if either can't make it Oliver spoke up as backup. I really wish I knew what to do.

    <TEXT>We've all been texting back and forth trying to figure out what to do. I'm pretty sure Leah turning is outside Madeleine's control, because she made a deal with Warin. I have to figure out how to either go over his head, or, if the fucker isn't dead, talk to him directly. Which I am *not* looking forward to, but, you know, if it's got to be done.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can anyone tell me where to find a good soft-serve ice cream cone?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 14:22:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I grew up on the east coast, right near a god's-honest walk-up ice cream parlor. I'm an essential worker who's going absolutely crazy doing nothing but work-sleep-work-sleep-work-sleep, in a customer-service position where I spend ten hours a day in a mask and deal with an endless stream of people who don't care. Today's my day off and dammit, I just want an ice cream cone. That's all I want. Let me have an ice cream chocolate-vanilla twist. I just want one fucking soft-serve ice cream cone to get through this week before I crack. (or put another way: let me be twelve again for five minutes.)  #8203; Thing is, I've never found such a thing down here. (Dairy Queen doesn't count. I don't know what that stuff is, other than "gross," but it's not ice cream. Where I grew up we had a DQ move in across the street from the ice cream parlor and it was literally in business and out of business in four months.) Does it exist? Where would I find it? I live in the West Valley, but I'm not even playing, I might seriously consider a drive to Tempe even with my janky mostly-nonexistent AC if that's the only place I could get one.  #8203; Please tell me one actually exists. Not gelato, not italian ice, not those snow-cone type things you see street sellers with, not a Mexican ice cream place that does all the fancy ice cream desserts, *soft-serve ice cream.* All those other things are awesome, but they're not what I want right now.  #8203; Anybody?</TEXT>

Even the occasional kid who wants to be a jerk usually just leaves it at yelling rude stuff, and the kind of hitting I #8217;m used to is like....a kid throwing out their arms for a photo and not realizing your face is right there, and then you just kind of laugh it off because they haven #8217;t figured out depth perception yet. Even Dale seemed kind of mind-blown, actually. I #8217;m guessing this doesn #8217;t happen often. And you and me both. I #8217;m working on something now, I hope.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve read the name in a couple old novels and always thought it was one of those things authors made up because it sounded way too on-the-nose to be real. If it #8217;s been around that long, it #8217;s got to have something going for it. And ah, the Sugar Bowl. I used to love that place when I lived in Scottsdale and I almost forgot it existed. (Glendale might as well be the other side of the planet.) I #8217;m glad to hear they #8217;re still around!

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Getting Closer, Maybe [Part 21]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-09 13:48:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part Twenty](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gfskdp/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) The thing about trying to undo an evil curse is, life just keeps on going while you're undoing it. I got back to work today. Caroline was hosting the pre-call lunch #8212;barbecue chicken, with real barbecue sauce. It was great, but Leah was barely picking at hers. Everybody was pretty quiet, actually. And then Dale walked in. I don't know what any of us were expecting was going to happen today. Dale in black jeans and top with a pair of gloves tucked in his belt wouldn't have been first guess. Or my tenth. He stared sort of awkwardly at the table, then nodded at us.  #8220;Mind if I take a seat? #8221; I'm pretty sure he wasn't expecting three people to pull out chairs at once, but he took one between Darius and Caroline. Mitchell pushed the dish of chicken toward him, and Oliver passed back the corn. Dale kind of gave me this nonplussed look and then served himself.  #8220;Look, I'm not going to waste time pretending we're all just fine and great this morning, #8221; he said.  #8220;It's not going to help anybody, I'm not up for it, and I'm pretty sure none of you are either. #8221; We all just kind of made these noncommittal agreeing sounds. Dale poured some iced tea and drank about half the glass before he kept going.  #8220;Right now we have two options. We can let Leah stay in the castle and take her off the roster, or we can assign her an actor. #8221; He paused. Leah looked ready to cry.  #8220;I'm not too fond of putting her in a stranger's hands. Not when there's still a chance to reverse what's happening. How good that chance is, I don't know. But I know Nathan's been going at it and I know some of you have been helping him, and I'm not going to undermine it. #8221; He took a breath.  #8220;So I'll be going into the park with her today. #8221;  #8220;You don't have to do that. #8221; Leah looked so defeated I'd probably have to ask Dale for an appropriately-dramatic word for it. Dale reached across the table and grabbed her hand.  #8220;I know I don't. #8221; He squeezed her hand, then let go.  #8220;So if anybody has anything to say, now's the time. #8221;  #8220;Not to be the downer in this group, #8221; Anne said,  #8220;but if you're with Leah all day, don't you have paperwork and stuff to do? #8221;  #8220;I can get in earlier. #8221;  #8220;And then when exactly are you going to sleep? #8221; I probably should've kept my mouth shut, but I couldn't help it #8212;he's already in before anyone else and out an hour after we are on days when Gary's not in.  #8220;What if I stay in horror from noon to two? You'd have to relieve me *at* two so I could go get dressed and get to the Pianist, but it'd give you a couple of hours. #8221; Caroline gave Leah a smile.  #8220;And anyway, I've always wondered what the goth side of life looks like. #8221;  #8220;I can take over at two, #8221; I said, and Dale shook his head.  #8220;You set her off last time. Pretty sure the last thing we need is the two of you teamed up in horror. #8221;  #8220;Then I can take the stagecoach and Mitchell can take over for a couple hours. #8221;  #8220;Hey, I'm not gonna wig you out making you drive that thing #8212; #8221;  #8220;I said I'll take the fucking stagecoach, didn't I #8212; #8221;  #8220; #8212;going to put a potential emergency on my hands when I need to be #8212; #8221;  #8220;Stop. #8221; I don't think any of us realized we were yelling until Oliver cut in.  #8220;Nathan, you used to work in Casablanca, didn't you? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221;  #8220;So you know what a Hollywood dinner rush looks like. I doubt it's changed that much in ten years. So Caroline can team up with Leah from noon to two. Nathan can come to Hollywood at two, *I'll* take the stagecoach, and Mitchell can tag-team Caroline from two to #8212;what time does Twin Vale dinner rush start? #8221;  #8220;About six. We get hit later because we serve alcohol. #8221;  #8220;Mitchell can tag-team in from two to four. Dale, you take over for Mitchell at four, he goes on break, at five he relieves me and I relieve Nathan. Nathan goes on break at five-fifteen. That gives him time to get back to Twin Vale so he can eat and puts him back onstage for dinner. My costume won't fit him, but there's a pretty great blue sequin jacket in the costume shop we could probably put with something #8212; #8221;  #8220;Black pants. #8221; Oliver gave me this confused look.  #8220;Black pants? #8221;  #8220;And a wig. A big blonde fuck-off 1980s wig. Or locs, if there's one that doesn't look like somebody made it out of Bob Marley's back hair. Jareth the Goblin King. #8221; He just kept giving me this blank look. I rolled my eyes at him.  #8220;Fucking straight boys and your not having an identity crisis at age eight over David Bowie in snakeskin pants. #8221;  #8220;Oh, trust me, *I* had an identity crisis, #8221; Anne said.  #8220;Do it. #8221;  #8220;I loved that movie, #8221; Maxine said.  #8220;I had this *huge* crush on Sarah when I was ten. Pretty sure I've got something in my makeup bag that'll show up on you I could use to give you the eyes. #8221;  #8220;Early bloomer, #8221; Dale cut in.  #8220;I was thirteen. #8221;  #8220;Hold on, you're not allowed to agree with me on movies. #8221;  #8220;I didn't discover Gene Kelly for another year. My options were limited. #8221; Even Leah laughed. Dale added his plate to the stack. Leah looked down at her hands.  #8220;Honestly, I #8212; #8221; She'd stopped laughing. Then she looked up at Dale, and I'm pretty sure everybody at the table was ready to cry.  #8220;Do I have to stay out all night tonight? #8221;  #8220;No. No, you don't have to. #8221; I'm not sure if it was incredible acting skills or the idea that everything else happening was already so damned weird anyway that kept the rest of the crew from not looking shocked at Dale dropping into the same quiet voice you'd use for a little kid with a skinned knee. He's normally so loud that even when he's not doing the manager thing you'd never expect he could be that soft. Leah just kind of nodded. Dale sighed and looked back at the rest of us.  #8220;Anything I should know before I head back up front? #8221;  #8220;I'll grab you the spare walkie and get it online before I go get dressed, #8221; Darius told him.  #8220;The other one from Nathan's set is in my trunk. Make sure you take something to drink. Even when it starts getting cooler at night you'll still be hot with all the people. Especially in horror. We get hit when everybody else starts clearing out. #8221;  #8220;All right. Mitchell, I'll meet you . . . where, Scratch's enclosure? #8221;  #8220;Sounds good. #8221; I caught Dale on the way out of Casablanca.  #8220;I need to talk to you. #8221; He nodded me toward his office, and when we were inside he took a seat in front of the desk. I sat next to him, but I really didn't want to. I wanted to pace, or stand, or do *something.* Sitting felt too calm.  #8220;I need to offer you a deal. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; Dale looked wary at the word *deal,* and I'm not surprised, really. Not after seeing where deals have gotten his family.  #8220;I will give you literally whatever you want to ask for if you'll ask upper management three questions for me, and give me the answers. Assuming the answers aren't going to cause you harm. #8221; Dale raised an eyebrow.  #8220;Nathan, 'whatever you want' is the *stupidest* offer you've ever made anyone. #8221;  #8220;No it isn't. Probably if I was making it to someone else, but it's you. #8221; Dale rubbed a hand across his face and sighed. When he raised his head again I realized just how exhausted he looked.  #8220;Two hours, #8221; he said.  #8220;Two hours out of this fucking park to be a normal human being. No management, no pretenders, just . . . whatever people do when they don't have a ball and chain on their ankles. #8221;  #8220;That's it? #8221; I was pretty sure there was some kind of fair-exchange rule being broken. Dale just gave me that same defeated, weary look.  #8220;Nate, you have no idea what just two hours would be worth to me. Give me your questions. #8221; I pulled a leaf from my legal pad out of my pocket. I was pretty sure he'd be able to remember the questions #8212;*pretty* sure, depending what the answers might be #8212;but the paper would give him a place to write answers down. And something tangible to go back to if they decided to rake him over the coals.  #8220;Thank you. #8221;  #8220;Thank me later. #8221; Dale opened the paper and waved me off for call time. The day went pretty smoothly, all things considered. We couldn't find a wig with locs that looked even remotely like real hair, but we did find one pretty close to the original movie, and after some consultation with Maxine she decided putting me in lipstick would help balance out the bleach-blonde and make it look less like something I scavenged last-minute and more like an actual 1980s villain. I was a little worried about how the Diva would take it, but she decided more or less instantly that I looked like Liberace, and just rolled with it. Although it did result in an interesting tidbit #8212;her telling me that her husband was a better pianist by far. No melting, no popping, and I decided not to push it because I'd have no way of finding her again, but I'm pretty sure that, along with her mentioning the fair, confirms pretenders remember *something.* Oliver came back at five, as promised, and steered me into the Hollywood breakroom to get changed back into Cowboy Martin before sending me back to Twin Vale. Mitchell waved me down right at the edge of Union.  #8220;How's Leah? #8221;  #8220;She's okay. Depressed, but she knows who she is, and she's not having any problems interacting with guests. Yet. She said she's probably going to ask Dale to drop her at the castle around seven-thirty. #8221; I actually skipped my break and just clocked out at seven. I knew Dale might give me a little hell, but I wanted to see Leah before she headed upstairs. She and Dale met me at the employee entrance to the gift shop. If Leah looked tired, Dale looked like a corpse walking. I was pretty sure he'd already had his chat with upper management, and when he handed me back a folded piece of paper I was certain. Leah gave me a hug and said she was going upstairs. I stopped her.  #8220;Hey, Leah? #8221;  #8220;Yeah? #8221;  #8220;This is gonna sound weird as hell, but the day you ended up in Twin Vale. You didn't eat any fruit the day before, did you? #8221;  #8220;I haven't had fruit in weeks, except the cranberries Oliver put on the salad that one day, #8221; she said.  #8220;I've mostly just been eating what you've been bringing. Is that important? #8221; Dale and I turned and stared at each other. I'd never told the rest of the crew, only Mitchell, because when Madeleine told me about the fruit I was the only one doing the lunch cooking. Leah looked between us.  #8220;It is, isn't it? #8221;  #8220;Well, #8221; Dale said.  #8220;Bad news is, you ate them. Good news is, if you don't eat them again, you might be okay. #8221; Then he slapped himself. I grabbed his hands and pushed them down to his sides before anything could decide to follow it up with a suckerpunch.  #8220;Don't do it again. #8221; Leah nodded.  #8220;This is one of those things you can't explain, isn't it? I just have to take it at face value. #8221;  #8220;Pretty much, #8221; Dale said.  #8220;Just stay away from fruit. Fruit juice, too. #8221; He pulled her into a hug, and then kissed the top of her head.  #8220;I'll bring you some vitamins. Get some sleep. And try not to worry too hard. We're here for you. #8221; Leah rolled her eyes, but she was still smiling a little.  #8220;Yes, Dad. And I'll brush my teeth. #8221;  #8220;Being a smartass has never become you, #8221; he told her, and she threw her arms around me before kissing my cheek and telling us both goodnight. She still had that sad, wistful look, but she didn't look like she was being crushed under it anymore, and I figured I could work with that. Dale turned to me.  #8220;Aren't you supposed to be onstage? #8221;  #8220;I clocked out already. #8221;  #8220;Nathan, what the hell #8212; #8221;  #8220;See, the way I see it is, you asked me for two hours, and Twin Vale's basically shut down for the night anyway because it's getting dark, so I could wait until ten, but then at a bare minimum we'd be looking at midnight, and then I still have to get home and cook for tomorrow, so, you know. Might as well go now. #8221; Dale gave me this look like he wasn't sure if he should be irritated or grateful.  #8220;Someday I'd really like to understand what the hell goes on in your head, Nate. #8221;  #8220;Right now what's going on in my head is I have literally never, not once in the whole time I've known you, gotten to drive you anywhere, except when I was trying to learn to drive the Jeep. And I have a car right now. So let's get the hell out of here. #8221; I thought he was going to argue, but he didn't #8212;just asked to stop at the office for his keys and his jacket. I told him I'd start the car and asked him to meet me in the parking lot, and when he stepped out I already had the CD player going and my questions tucked neatly back in the legal pad in the back, under a couple of books. I waved at him and honked. Not that I really had to, mind you, but ten years ago I was still trying to get my credit in decent-enough shape to get a car, and being able to honk and wave was kind of cool.  #8220;Where are we going? #8221;  #8220;You'll see when we get there. #8221; There's a state park on the other side of town with some pretty gorgeous beaches in it. Strictly speaking, it closes at sundown, but there aren't any gates to keep you out or anything. It's all honor system, which is why we ended up on the beach around eight-thirty with a driftwood bonfire and our feet in the water. Dale looked ready to fall asleep. So I splashed him. Like I said, sometimes I'm just a bastard.  #8220;Hey! #8221; I gave him a big grin.  #8220;Yeah? #8221;  #8220;The hell was that for? #8221;  #8220;Well it's very nice water, and it seemed like you weren't appreciating it. #8221; And then I jumped up and went running into it. I was pretty sure he'd follow me, and I was right. I was also pretty sure I was about to get dunked on, and I was right about that, too. I don't think he was expecting me to come up and dunk on *him,* which is why it worked, but it was enough to make him surface laughing and try to push me under again. I have no idea how long we were in the water, but it was long enough we were both complaining about our stomachs hurting from laughing too hard, and when we staggered back to shore I gave him one last giant splash.  #8220;I thought we called truce! #8221;  #8220;Yeah, that was for the water fight. This is for the wet T-shirt contest. #8221;  #8220;Ah, fuck you, #8221; he said, but he was grinning when he said it, and I flopped back down next to the fire to dry out. Dale sat down next to me.  #8220;You ever try to find your zodiac sign? #8221;  #8220;Huh? #8221;  #8220;Your zodiac sign. The constellation. Have you ever tried to find it? #8221;  #8220;Huh. No. Have you? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; Dale pointed straight up.  #8220;Capricorn. You're Virgo, aren't you? End of this month? #8221; I kind of stared at him.  #8220;I'm surprised you remember. #8221; And just like that, it was awkward again.  #8220;I never forgot. #8221; I shrugged and tried to steer back out of uncomfortable waters.  #8220;They all look the same to me. Except the Big Dipper. I'm pretty sure everybody can find that one. #8221;  #8220;When we were kids Dean wanted to be an astronaut. He had the whole star map on his ceiling with those little glow in the dark stickers. I had to learn way too many of these. #8221;  #8220;Please tell me you learned the zodiac ones first just to fuck with him. #8221; Dale started laughing.  #8220;The first one I learned was Orion. I don't remember most of them anymore. #8221; He sighed and reached for the pile of shoes and phones we'd left behind when we went swimming. Or, well, splashing.  #8220;I don't know what time you started the two hours from, but it's after ten o'clock. #8221;  #8220;Oh. #8221; I stretched and felt my back crack. The one bad thing about being in the driver's seat is, you can't really do that.  #8220;Okay. What's an Orion and where is it? #8221; Dale stared at me. Opened his mouth, shut it, opened it again, shut it again, and then sat there with it kind of half-open like he was pretty sure there was a response to *what's an Orion* but didn't know what it was.  #8220;You asked to be a normal human being. Normal human beings don't put a timer on having fun if they don't have anywhere else to be. Tell me some stupid zodiac stuff. Isn't one of them a crab? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. Um, yeah. Cancer. Cancer's the crab. You don't want to leave? #8221;  #8220;I mean, I'm good, but we can go if you want. I can drop you at the park to get your truck. Or you can come over to Leah's, I already asked her. I was messing around trying a tiramisu recipe and the layers separated, but it still tastes okay and it's not gonna eat itself. #8221; Dale voted for tiramisu. We put out the fire, and I grabbed a couple of blankets from the trunk so neither of us had to ride in damp jeans. Dale almost fell asleep in the passenger seat again, and after dessert I told him he should probably stay over #8212;I was almost positive he'd fall asleep behind the wheel if he tried driving home. I found the sweatpants Leah gave me when I was on the stagecoach, and paired them with a tee shirt. Most of my clothes are too small for Dale, but I like loose clothes for sleeping, and it at least gave him something to cover up with. I threw his clothes in the washer while he got changed, considered the possibilities for lunch, and said  #8220;fuck it #8221; and threw together a five-minute marinade for some kebabs. As long as it's filling and it tastes good, I'm pretty sure at this point nobody cares what I feed them. Dale peeked out to say goodnight when I was on my way to bed, and hugged me. He didn't say anything. He didn't really need to. I hugged back, and I didn't say anything either, until I told him he was leaning on me and if he fell asleep we were both going to hit the floor. He laughed a little and headed back to Leah's room. Tomorrow, I'll look at the answers he got me. But normal human beings don't have to sneak to the car to read things, either, and even if he doesn't really know I kept the paper out of the apartment, I get the feeling he *will* know, kind of, somehow. Maybe he'll sleep better, and then I'll feel like it was actually a fair exchange.

    <TEXT>\[\[AN AUTHOR'S NOTE FIRST. Although I try to stay entirely in-character in both these posts and the comments, I'm sure people noticed the two-day absence. I took a night off, because if I was writing this in November I'd have been a NaNoWriMo winner in only 23 days, and the following day I was cutting a snack while working on this chapter and ended up with four stitches in my thumb. I'm going to attempt to continue the one-a-night posts, but my ability to type has been severely curtailed by both pain and, you know, being a touch-typist who's down a finger. If chapters get slightly longer in between, please rest assured the story is already plotted through to the end, which is rapidly drawing close, and that if I actually need to keep going past the next ten days, one-a-night updates will resume when I have a functional thumb again. Also, it doesn't really matter for any practical purposes, but it is deeply important to me that you know the knife joke in this chapter was planned *two fucking weeks ago.*\]\]  #8203; [Part 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/ggfpoo/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Well, yesterday happened. I'm in Dale's truck outside a gas station right now, and you probably couldn't guess what I'm doing here if your life depended on it, which I guess means I have to find a way to lay this out without sounding like I'm a complete disaster. You know what, scratch that, you already know I'm a disaster. Some days at the park are nice and almost lazy. You're working, but there's just this mellow rhythm you fall into and the next thing you know it's dusk. Some days you get one random wild event that sticks out, but the rest is pretty generic. And some days you go postal on your boss, who also exists in a very gray area somewhere between your close friend and your ex. Yesterday was the last kind. I dropped the kebabs off at Casablanca, but I wasn't really feeling up to people, so I told everyone I was going to head to the Twin Vale breakroom to chill for awhile. Nothing personal #8212;sometimes you just don't feel chatty. I figured I'd spend some downtime, which I haven't had much of lately, looking at the notes Dale gave me yesterday and relaxing a little in a place that wasn't so obviously devoid of its proper owner. Dale's handwriting looked rushed, the kind of thing you'd expect from somebody transcribing something, and the idea gave me something of a chill. I wasn't just looking at what he'd gleaned from whatever was said #8212;I was looking at the actual words of the Wild Ones themselves. *Is it too late to return Leah to being human?* *It isn't too late, but the longer you dawdle, the higher the price.* I'm pretty sure I sighed in relief so hard I shrank a couple inches just from stress. Maybe not much time left . . . but at least still a little, enough to figure it out. *Leah told Warin 'I want my humanity back' when she accepted his wager. Why is him not giving it to her a breach of contract?* *She stated desire. She did not demand terms.* I was pretty sure they were quibbling, given that he accepted  #8220;I want you to stop this weird shit #8221; as a demand, but strictly speaking, they'd find some way to justify it. Lost cause there. I got to the last question and stopped. *Since Leah's initial turning was against the terms of the original contract, why won't you just let her go?* The word  #8220;NO #8221; was scrawled beneath it in huge, jagged letters. There was a blotch on the paper, like possibly Dale'd written it bearing down so hard it'd snapped his pen tip. There was a tap on my shoulder, and when I spun around I saw Dale standing there, looking a little shocked.  #8220;Leah said you skipped out on lunch, you okay? #8221;  #8220;No. You know what, Dale, no, I'm not okay. #8221; I held up the paper.  #8220;They won't tell me anything, I'm watching my best friend turn into some kind of fae-zombie, I've been spinning my wheels trying to help her going through hundred-year-old park paperwork that tells me nothing, just found out I've been getting perved on by some creepy supernatural motherfucking . . . shapeshifting doppelganger, I literally can't figure out how to use half the shit everyone around me takes for granted because electronics have changed so much in the last decade and nearly destroying the coffeemaker out of pure when-did-these-get-computers is, let me tell you, *not a fabulous time,* and half the things I need to know from you you can't tell me and the other half you fucking *won't*, because I guess it doesn't matter *why* you fed me to the fucking wolves and then just pissed off for ten years without so much as a by-the-way-fuck-you-Nathan, who fucking cares because it's over, right? Except it's *not* over, Dale, I still get to deal with the nightmares and the culture shock and everything and everyone I knew being fucking *gone*, and every time I ask you just leave me on read or find an excuse to change the conversation so no, Dale, I am *not* fucking okay. #8221; I didn't realize how loudly I'd been yelling until I heard how quiet the room suddenly got when I stopped. Dale looked like I'd slapped him.  #8220;I'm sorry. #8221; Dale sighed and ran his hand over his face.  #8220;Don't be. I, uh. I guess I've had that coming, haven't I? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, well, I didn't have to be an asshole #8212; #8221;  #8220;You weren't. #8221; Dale sat down and looked down at his hands for an uncomfortably long time before looking back up at me.  #8220;I've spent way too long trying to find a way to make this not sound totally pathetic. I'm pretty sure it can't be done at this point. #8221; I opened my mouth to tell him he wasn't pathetic #8212;Dale is a lot of things, and not all of them are nice, but pathetic is for bullies and people who lose their shit over a 25-cent expired coupon #8212;but he cut me off.  #8220;If you really want to know, come see me after work. At the apartment. I don't think I'm going to have answers that'll satisfy you. But you'll know. #8221; I thought about not going, if I'm going to be totally honest. It isn't like Dale to just duck and swerve around questions. He'll sooner say  #8220;I'm not telling you that #8221; than he will to just run you in circles. Something about him being so unwilling to speak up gave me danger vibes. But I went, because I wanted answers. Whether he thought they'd satisfy me or not. The first thing I noticed walking in was . . . *empty.* I'd seen the apartment already, and it didn't seem like anything in particular was missing, but it *felt* like something was missing, if you know what I mean. Dale was sitting on the sofa drinking directly from a bottle of tequila. He raised it at me when I walked in.  #8220;I'm sober, #8221; he said, by way of greeting.  #8220;Mostly. #8221; He capped the bottle.  #8220;If you want something to drink you'll have to get it from the carton. #8221;  #8220;I'll pass, thanks. #8221; I sat down next to him, still trying to figure out what exactly was pinging me as being so *off*. Dale stared at me, suddenly serious.  #8220;Nate, do you trust me? #8221; He caught me off-guard enough I didn't even answer right away. *What the hell kind of a question is that?* I finally shrugged.  #8220;More than I did three months ago, if that answers your question. #8221;  #8220;Do you trust me enough that if I tell you I'm doing something for your safety, you'd believe me? #8221; I thought about it. More to the point, I thought about Leah #8212;Dale surrounding her sanctuary with iron and running water, swabbing her blisters and cradling her in his arms until she reached safety. All things he didn't do for me. Maybe all things he learned from me he needed to do, all things considered. It was bitter . . . but it was okay. It was better than him abandoning her to the dark corners of the horror section. Finally I nodded at him. He took a chain from around his neck and draped it over mine. There was a key dangling at the end of it.  #8220;Then I'll tell you the answers to your questions. And as soon as I have, you have to leave. If you can't promise me you'll do that, I can't tell you anything. #8221;  #8220;I promise. #8221; Dale took a deep breath.  #8220;I'm going to go backward. You'll understand why when I'm done. #8221; He settled in, hands between his knees.  #8220;You asked me why I never came to visit you. That isn't totally true, but you wouldn't know it. It took me two and a half years to work up the guts for it. I was terrified of what you'd say. You were the first person who ever really completely believed in what I wanted out of my life and I didn't think I could stand watching that disappear. But I knew I owed it to you and finally I . . .  #8221; He made a face.  #8220;Christ, I was stupid. I went to see you because I wanted to try to make it up to you, and they . . . they'd just announced it, the Supreme Court made marriage legal. I was going to ask if you'd marry me. I couldn't change what I'd done and I couldn't have pulled off the kind of rescue Leah did, but I could promise to stand beside you. #8221;  #8220;But I never saw you. #8221;  #8220;No, #8221; Dale agreed.  #8220;I wanted to get there first thing in the morning, but it was the kind of bullshit day where I couldn't get *shit* done. There was something every minute and none of it could be put off. I finally got back to Twin Vale around nine at night and you were sleeping already. So I grabbed a blanket out of the car #8212;I had a Land Rover then, I didn't keep the Jeep after you were gone, I couldn't #8212;and figured I'd settle down next to you and talk to you in the morning. Maybe you'd kick me right the hell off the coach, I didn't know, but at least you'd have the chance to say your piece. And that's what I did, until about two in the morning. #8221;  #8220;What happened at two in the morning? #8221;  #8220;I thought I woke up because it was raining, and then I realized that didn't make sense, the coach was under the lean-to, and even if it was raining it shouldn't be warm, and that's when I looked up and realized W #8212;you know who I mean. He was dangling off the roof over me with his mouth open. #8221; I didn't actually say anything, but I must have made some kind of face that expressed *Jesus fucking Christ, Dale* pretty clearly, because he laughed. It wasn't a nice laugh. It reminded me of the first time he showed me any of his film-editing, not able to say anything about his own work except how much it sucked.  #8220;I just about fell off the stagecoach. He just laid up there laughing while I ran. I didn't know if I'd swallowed anything, but I . . .  #8221; He unbuttoned the top of his shirt and pulled it down off one shoulder. I know Leah told you he had scars in her blog, but she didn't really explain what was there #8212;waves and lumps and lines ranging from thin and fine to jagged, like his cutting implement stuck and he just kept going, gouging his own blocky and hated handwriting into his skin.  #8220;I must've done ninety the whole way home. If they can't take your name, they can't take you. So I . . . I made sure I wouldn't forget. #8221; He buttoned his shirt.  #8220;It was a utility knife, by the way. I went for the butcher block and swore I could hear you yelling at me about paring knives being for potatoes. #8221; It probably says a lot about the kind of people we both are that I started laughing.  #8220;Jesus, Dale. #8221; His smile back looked a little queasy.  #8220;Yeah. So there you have it. The reason I never came back. He wouldn't have stopped trying. I could dish it out, but I wasn't willing to sit at the table myself. Pretty fucking knight-in-shining-armor, isn't it? #8221; I think he was hoping I'd lose my shit on him again, but when I finally looked up and met his eyes the look he gave me back was shocked.  #8220;Did you know, if you want to commit suicide, and you go jump off a dock, your body will still try to kick in your automatic drowning response to save you? Even if everything in you says you want to die. Your body won't let you until it can't keep you alive anymore. #8221; Dale opened his mouth, and I shook my head at him.  #8220;I can be pissed at you for a lot of stuff, Dale. I can't be pissed at you for not wanting to end up like me. It'd be the same as getting pissed at you for not drowning. #8221;  #8220;Thank you. #8221; He looked like he might cry.  #8220;Really. Spent a lot of years thinking the best thing I could do would be just give up and let him put me wherever the hell he wanted. But Mom was still dealing with Deanna dying and . . . you know. I didn't want to take Dean away from her by bringing him out here too. #8221; He rubbed the back of his neck, probably to keep me from saying exactly what I thought about Dean and taking over the park. I decided to skip it.  #8220;Why would he want to make you a pretender, anyway? #8221; Dale reached out and tucked the key under my tee-shirt. Then he took another of those deep breaths, and reached into his shirt pocket. He handed me a pack of Polaroids.  #8220;What are these? #8221;  #8220;Look at them later. #8221; He took one last deep breath. When he started talking again, it was faster and more fluid than anything I'd ever heard out of him in the entire time I'd known him. He'd been practicing it for hours #8212;I was sure of it #8212;and it came out like a rapidfire machine gun.  #8220;When I was eleven I started taking pictures, you already know that. By the time I was twelve I'm pretty sure I'd photographed every single thing in the fucking park from every possible angle and I was sick of it, sick of doing the same things in the same places day after day and not getting to go anywhere because Mom was busy with Dean and so this one day when my dad was busy I stole his keys and got into the locked bathroom. #8221; I was going to say something like *what the FUCK, Dale,* but he held a hand up to stop me.  #8220;I actually got pretty far in before I got caught. I couldn't see the hole anymore and then he grabbed the back of my shirt, he . . . he dragged me back out into the bathroom and he was *pissed*, I was sure he was going to kill me, and then he just kind of turned his head to the side and started laughing and pointed me out of the bathroom, it was morning when I went in and I could already see the park lights going out for the night so I asked him, I asked him . . . *fuck,* #8221; he said, and I saw him dig his nails into the backs of his hands,  #8220;I asked him if he'd promise not to tell my parents, and told him I'd bring him something good, I didn't even know I was making a fucking deal when he nodded at me and I, #8221; he rocked forward, toward the table.  #8220;I brought him a pack of fucking *Pokemon cards,* he didn't take them and I, my fucking stupid ass, I thought he was just letting it go but he decided the something good was *you #8212;get the fuck out of here, Nathan #8212;* #8221; I blinked at him. It wasn't that I meant to break my promise #8212;he just caught me off-guard.  #8220;Huh? #8221; Dale lunged at me. Or, well, something else wearing Dale's body did. He grabbed the chain around my neck, and I grabbed his hands. One of his knees slammed into the coffee table. The stack of Polaroids went everywhere. The tequila bottle toppled and #8212;  #8212;bounced. I looked up at the window, and the small part of the kitchen visible through the door, and it hit me what was wrong, why the place felt so empty: My knives, the blinds, the lamp from the end table, all of the glass and sharp things were locked in the bedroom, *and I had the key*. Dale got to his feet, pulling me with him by the chain. No wonder he wanted me to leave, and take the key with me #8212;this was his punishment for saying too much, for telling me about the Underground. At least one of us was going to die. They might decide suicide was the best option for him, but given I was still in the line of fire, I had the feeling that wasn't how it was going to go. Between us, Dale and I balance out each others' flaws pretty well. But neither of us has ever been good at thinking before we act. For Dale, that usually ends in disaster, but either better luck or better self-preservation instincts mean it usually works out for me. Also, I might be small, but I spent every day for ten years wrestling a pair of 1500-pound supernaturally-psychotic horses. So I wrenched his hand back far enough I heard a snap, and when his grip on the chain loosened I kissed him. Some idiot out there, several of them actually, have suggested that life-saving kisses are some sweet thing with birds singing and bells chiming and all that corny bullshit. In reality, it looks more like a pair of men, one with a broken wrist and one trying not to choke on a far-too-high-quality necklace, going in circles in front of a coffee table like a pair of dancing drunks until one of them finally goes limp. Not the choking one, thankfully, because that one was me. I was suddenly a leaning post for someone about twice my own weight, but I wasn't unconscious. I gave Dale a few seconds to stop breathing so hard before I patted his back.  #8220;I'd like to be able to move, thanks. #8221; Dale staggered upright. Then he stared at me like I'd punched him directly in the head instead of yanking him off me by the wrist.  #8220;What did you do? #8221;  #8220;Saved your fucking life, dumbass. Don't ever go telling me shit you know's going to get you killed ever again. #8221;  #8220;You saved my #8212; #8221; He stopped. His eyes grew wide.  #8220;You just *opted in #8212;* #8221;  #8220;I think that's what it's called, yeah, and if you try to get me to take it back I'm gonna be really pissed. #8221; I picked his arm up by the elbow and brought it up to his chest.  #8220;You're going to need a cast, sorry. I didn't know what else to do. #8221; Dale kind of looked down at his wrist like he'd only just realized it was injured.  #8220;Oh. Okay. #8221; Then he stopped and looked back up at me.  #8220;*Why?* #8221;  #8220;Well, you were kind of choking me out to get the key #8212; #8221;  #8220;You kissed me. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, and like I was saying, I didn't know how long the chain was going to hold and it seemed like a really bad idea to #8212; #8221; Dale shook his head. Hard.  #8220;Why did you save me? #8221; He met my eyes, and I think I've said this before, but I'd really be totally okay with resurrecting Warin just long enough to kill him again, just as a little thank-you for the stuff that put that kind of look in Dale's eyes. And the stuff that left him with a pain tolerance so high he could basically ignore a broken wrist, that too.  #8220;I didn't save you. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, well . . .  #8221; The problem with doing things when you don't think about them is, if they don't work you can always say you didn't think, but if they *do* then you have to explain yourself.  #8220;Either you were gonna kill me, or I was gonna lose you, and I wasn't really okay with either one of those. #8221; Dale made this kind of choked-off noise and looked down. I pulled his head onto my shoulder and let him stay there. Maybe this sounds stupid #8212;maybe it *is* stupid #8212;but whether it turns out to be a good decision or not at least I finally made one, and that's kind of a relief. It's one less thing to worry about, and right now that's more than just  #8220;kind of #8221; a relief. I finally told him I had to take him to the hospital #8212;he was going to need a splint at a bare minimum, and that was if the snap I heard was a serious sprain instead of a break. He nodded against my neck and let me walk him out to Leah's car so I could drive. He wouldn't let me drive this morning, though. Dale doesn't usually go in for macho bullshit, but on the rare occasions he does decide it's the best thing he can possibly do, it's impossible to convince him otherwise. I made him agree I could ride in with him just in case. Now I get to explain all this to Leah. That's going to be a trip and a half.

    <TEXT>That is HILARIOUS.  #8203; I actually kind of went "this is pinging me for some reason," so it's probably something I read about in a linguistics book at some point, but I was actually looking up names for the mystery third sibling (since Dale says he has "siblings" but we only meet one so I figured there were more offscreen somewhere), and that's when it popped up and I went "you have *got* to be fucking with me."  #8203; . . . . . and then I proceeded to give the third sibling a name that meant "valley" just in case it wasn't coincidence because I didn't want to ruin your symbolism.  #128514; #128514; #128514; #128514; #128514;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Birthday Boy [Part 23]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-15 13:56:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/giad1j/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; I hate my coworkers, and also Dale. Okay, that isn't actually true. I don't *hate* them. I'm just really not a fan of being made to cry in public.Today was my birthday. I'm not sure if it counted as 22 or 32, but the logistics didn't matter to the rest of the actors, who scared the shit out of me when I walked into Casablanca carrying a crockpot dish only to hear *happy birthday* screamed by not just the actors but also the entire Casablanca kitchen staff, who normally leave us to our own devices as long as we don't make a mess but also apparently couldn't resist being part of the drama. I've never been a big birthday person. When I was a kid my birthday every year consisted of going to buy new school shoes and then getting pizza for dinner. I don't think I ever even had a birthday cake until Dale and I got together, and I didn't have enough time to get in the habit before I stopped having birthdays altogether. Either Dale told everyone this, or they were determined to make up for what they saw as ten missed years of parties, because there were balloons and everything, and after Leah and Oliver literally dragged me to the table I discovered there was also a cake, which was apparently a joint project between Maxine and Darius, and also lunch #8212;Mitchell convinced the Casablanca staff to let him use a stove, and he and Leah put together Swedish meatballs and spaetzle. Anne took my crockpot and spirited it off to the kitchen, yelling gaily about how I'd brought chicken wings and dinner was going to be awesome. I was looking forward to my wings, but apparently Mitchell dug out his family cookbook for lunch, and it was pretty great #8212;even knowing they were going to make me blow out candles afterward. I was hoping to survive to the end of cake and then suddenly remember something important I had to do in Twin Vale, but before I could excuse myself Anne and Caroline pulled out one of the little rolling dish tables I remembered from off-season catering. There were *packages* on it, and I was ready to start actively protesting when I glanced up and saw Dale standing by the only unlocked door, checking his phone messages and ever so casually blocking the exit.  #8220;Christ. You guys are actually going to make me to the whole birthday thing, aren't you. #8221;  #8220;You want what's in there, Nathan, #8221; Oliver told me. He pushed a bag at me.  #8220;Here, start with this one, the rest'll be easier. #8221; It was a bottle of Jack Daniels. The honey one. I was laughing too hard to wonder who told Oliver it the only alcohol I ever bothered keeping in the apartment on the regular. Leah got this huge mischievous grin, and suddenly every single one of the girls had a phone whipped out and pointed at me.  #8220;This isn't at all disturbing, #8221; I told them. They all just kept grinning. Leah peeked over at the cart. #8220;Hey Darius? Can you get the blue one? #8221; Darius hefted the package.  #8220;Jesus, Leah, what'd you get him, gold bars? #8221; Leah just snickered. Darius pushed it across the table to me.  #8220;Watch out, I think this might be your new personal training program. #8221; Apparently, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who tear their wrapping paper, and those who actually try to find the ends of the tape and unwrap it nicely. If you're the second kind, and you're unwrapping something from Leah, she will tear the paper for you. I understood a little better why half the crew had their phones trained on me once I saw what was inside, anyway. I guess Leah wanted me screaming  #8220;holy shit! #8221; in a voice-breaking octave from as many angles as possible. And also, possibly, was hoping at least one person would catch me landing on the floor when I tried to hug her and fell on my ass instead.  #8220;I had to find something online since I couldn't leave, so I started looking up J.R.R. Tolkien books and looking for titles I didn't recognize. #8221;  #8220;I literally couldn't afford this when the complete set came out. #8221; *The Complete History of Middle-Earth.* Go ahead, call me a fucking nerd. I won't see why that's a problem, but I won't argue. Anne took the last thing off the cart and cradled it in her arms. I saw her and Caroline exchanging that oh-boy-what-if-we-fucked-up look. Finally Anne set it down in front of me and put a hand on top of it.  #8220;Okay, so, Dale said not to tell you anything, but he did so much on this and I really don't feel like it's *right* if I don't tell you that so . . . this is from all of us. #8221;  #8220;Anne, remind me if I ever get my hands on the international nuclear launch codes, you're the person I want to give them to, #8221; Dale commented. There were a couple of distracted laughs, but it was pretty obvious everyone was waiting to see me open the package. I finally slit the tape and pulled out the contents, and that's when I started hating my coworkers, because I started leaking from the eyes right away, and it only got worse the longer it went on. It was a photo album. A big one. I recognized a lot of the photos from Warin's walls #8212;but someone had gone carefully through and repaired the damage done by ten years underground. I flipped through, wanting to see what parts of my life I was getting back, and then hit the back half and just straight up started crying. It was all new. Everyone at the table had gone through their phones and found pictures of the spring and summer and gotten them printed, and then they'd put together an album.  #8220;Seriously, guys, seriously? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, #8221; Caroline said.  #8220;I asked Dale if he thought you'd be upset if I tried to clean up some of the photos from Twin Vale because you said something about them being stolen and I figured that probably meant you didn't have copies, and he said it'd probably be something you'd like for your birthday and then he said he might still have negatives of at least some of them, and it just kind of . . . mushroomed. #8221;  #8220;Dale and I went through negatives until I thought my head was going to explode, #8221; Mitchell told me.  #8220;I have no idea how anybody can do that for *fun.* I didn't even get to play with the chemicals. #8221;  #8220;If you want to play in a darkroom, you'll have to find someone willing to teach you first. Nate, if you cry all over those I don't have a way to fix them. #8221; I wiped my eyes.  #8220;So you literally redeveloped *all those fucking photos?* #8221; I wasn't the pretender with the most photos in Warin's lair #8212;that was Leah #8212;but there were still a couple hundred just of me and Dale hanging on the asshole's wall.  #8220;Only the ones I had negatives for that I thought you'd be interested in. Caroline did digital processing on the rest. #8221;  #8220;I was a graphic design major, #8221; Caroline said. I guessed that was supposed to explain things.  #8220;I just took bets on how hard you'd cry, #8221; Oliver said, and I flipped him off.  #8220;You know what, in the immortal words of Alice in Wonderland, fucking *bite me.* #8221;  #8220;Eat me, #8221; Oliver said, in this tone of voice like it was causing him physical pain to hear someone fuck up Alice in Wonderland.  #8220;You missed your chance, straight boy, that offer expired when I stopped being single. #8221;  #8220;Wait, *what?* #8221; Anne shrieked the question so loudly it actually hurt a little. I ran the last thirty seconds back over in my head.  #8220;Fuck, this isn't how I was going to tell you guys that. #8221;  #8220;It's like being in charge of the world's most juvenile PTA, #8221; Dale mused.  #8220;Good job, Nate. All of you can stop staring now. #8221;  #8220;Stop being a jerk or I'm going to show everyone the hobbit pictures, I know I saw them in here. #8221;  #8220;You guys got back together? #8221; I thought Anne was going to start crying.  #8220;Like really back together? #8221;  #8220;No. Yes? Maybe. Kind of? It's complicated. #8221; Anne screamed and threw her arms around me and started babbling congratulations. When it comes to park people, Anne makes me feel tall #8212;and weak as shit. I batted at her arms and she loosened up the vise grip a little. Dale shook his head and rolled his eyes.  #8220;And if I ever need a character witness, your absolutely *unshakable* testimony is what I want on the stand, Nate. #8221; Anne finally let go of me. She was teary-eyed.  #8220;Do I need to be worried? #8221;  #8220;She thinks, #8221; Oliver said, and made a face like he'd just stuck his head right in the kitchen trashes,  #8220;you guys are *cute.* #8221;  #8220;I mean, I do look pretty awesome, but Dale's in cargo pants, he loses all rights to be called cute today. #8221; The entire table burst into laughter. Dale reached past me, took my bottle of whiskey, and dropped it into his knee pocket before heading for the door. I had to chase him out into the plaza before I could get it back. Anne had actual tears running down her face when I got back inside. I'm pretty sure she saw me kiss him and it was too much for her. We broke up for call not long after that, and I stashed my gifts in Leah's room. She asked if I'd take a look at her back while we were up there #8212; #8220;I don't think the futon likes me much, #8221; were her exact words. I didn't see anything wrong, except the lack of tattoos. I just told her I'd never seen an actual *white* person before, and she laughed and told me she's never been able to tan. Then she got quiet.  #8220;Especially this summer, #8221; she said, and turned around with her shirt in her arms.  #8220;Look at my neck. There's no tan line at all. I actually think I've been getting *paler.* #8221; She met my eyes, and I hugged her.  #8220;It's part of the change, isn't it? #8221;  #8220;I don't know. I wish I did. I guess we'll find out once we get it reversed, right? #8221;  #8220;I don't think it's going to reverse, #8221; she said, but her voice was so soft I barely heard her, and when I let go so she could put her shirt back on I had to wipe her eyes. We walked down to call together, and she teased me that she might show up in Twin Vale later to rob me and get the entire crowd to sing happy birthday to me. I told her, with all the love and respect I could muster, that if she did I would personally bring Dale to the castle with the full cut of *La Roue,* make some casual remark about film editing, and then put the horseshoe right in the middle of the door so she couldn't leave. She told me to get bent. Which, in all fairness, is about the same reaction I'd have if somebody told me they were going to trap me with a seven-hour-long silent movie and no way out of watching it. It was a pretty good afternoon. When I went on break Madeleine made her way over to Twin Vale with a doggie bag from King Arthur's. I was going to tell her I already had dinner, but then I realized she'd gotten hold of a permanent marker somewhere and written *GIFT* all over the bag. I didn't even know she knew how to write, but if you've ever seen a kindergartener's handwriting, you know there's no adult handwriting on earth like it. I was going to make a joke about it being a gift bag before I realized why she'd done it #8212;she couldn't *tell* me it was a gift and not a contract, so she found a way to make sure I knew anyway #8212;and then I just wanted to hug her for a million years. She's a sweet kid. She'd gotten some of the tissue paper from one of the hotdog carts and wrapped up one of those string friendship bracelet things in it, and then put the whole thing in the bag. I tied the bracelet to my keys while she pantomimed her way through an explanation about Maxine teaching her to make them. Then she asked if she could teach me while I ate my dinner. I'm not really the crafty type, but I said sure just because it's got to get lonely being a little kid living in an amusement park with literally nobody to talk to. We try to make sure she's got books and toys and stuff, but it doesn't change that we're all still adults with a job to do. Dale was waiting for me in the Twin Vale breakroom at the end of the night. Leah was already in bed, and he'd come by with my box of gifts. We ended up sitting in the bed of his pickup for a couple of hours with a pair of drinks we mixed at the Casablanca bar. Dale plugged his phone in through the window at the back of the cab so I could use his flashlight to read, and in-between essays we talked about getting in trouble as kids for the weird ways we'd find to read when we weren't supposed to. He doesn't really know how to handle being able to just *talk* without having to weigh every word in realtime yet, so it was kind of a weird conversation, but it was . . . nice. I'd say it was like old times, but it really wasn't. It was a lot calmer, for one thing. And neither of us said anything about Leah, but her car was still parked just a few spaces from Dale's, and we both looked at it more than once. Eventually Dale checked the time and told me it was after midnight. I don't think either one of us wanted to leave, there's so much shit going on in the park right now it was nice to have a couple of peaceful hours, but you can't just stop the world for an indefinite amount of time while you chill, unfortunately. He kissed me goodnight, and I thought about something Leah said he told her #8212;that the Wild Ones always know where he is and what he's doing #8212;and broke off a little faster than I might've if I hadn't thought it. If I want to stay with him, that's going to take one hell of a lot of getting used to. If he noticed, he didn't say #8212;he just double-checked the front gates and saw me to Leah's car. I guess birthdays aren't so bad. I still kinda hate my coworkers just a little for the crying thing, though.

    <TEXT>Younger than that. I pieced together u/girl_from_the_crypt's timeline, and we have this:  #8203; Leah indicates Dale is "a douchey guy in his late 20s." We know she's an unreliable narrator, so we can put Dale's age anywhere between 27 and perhaps 33 (the point at which I'd expect her to notice he's got fine lines and perhaps bump her age estimate).  #8203; Nathan says he and Dale reconnected "years after" high school, and also that they were living together--which implies they were together for I'd say at least six months.  #8203; Dale says Warin took Nathan after spotting a photo of the two of them on Dale's desk, so they're together long enough that Dale is comfortable basically announcing to the park that Nathan is his partner. Keep in mind Nathan says he's been on the coach for ten years, so we're going back to 2009-10 here--Dale making that statement, even by something as neutral as a presumably G-rated portrait, would have been *incredibly* risky, and not something I'd imagine he'd do after only a month or two.  #8203; Nathan, of course, states that he's been on the coach for ten years.  #8203; If we go at the *absolute oldest age possible* by Leah's descriptions, then Nathan and Dale were only about 22-23 when Nathan was taken.  #8203; If we accept Leah's statement about Dale's age as fact, then Nathan had to have been a little fast and loose with his "it was years after" statement (unless, perhaps, he dropped out and got his GED, since he got kicked out of the house in his sophomore year--it could have been "years after" for him, but not Dale), because at that point the absolute oldest either of them could have been when Nathan was turned was *nineteen.*  #8203; Yeah. The more you look at the timeline on this story, the worse you feel for Dale.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Concerned [Part 24]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-19 13:45:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gk9kes/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; The regular season ended today. If you ever wondered why Leah's blog made it seem like everyone works seven days a week, 365 days a year, that's because of the way amusement park schedules work when you're at an actual old-fashioned kind of park as opposed to, say, Disney World. We *do* work seven days a week . . . but it's more like 130 days a year, from May first through Labor Day, and you can take one day off a week as long as you have adequate coverage for your pretender. Then it's weekends-only through Halloween, and then a couple hours a day #8212;not necessarily every day, either #8212;for the rest of the year. Thing is, during the off-season, the pretenders' actors still get paid for coming in. During the season, it's hourly #8212;but in the off-season you earn a half-day's pay just for being in for an hour. Two hours, and you've made your day. It's good money, too, at least for the actors at this park, since the family has a vested interest in keeping turnover low. Pretty much all of the actors have told me at least once the summer crunch is worth it just for the winter lull, and while there's a pretty big turnover in the operations staff #8212;just like anywhere, I guess #8212;there are enough people who come back every summer that Dale can offer to open individual sections for catering special events during the off-season and know he's got staff. The rides don't run in winter #8212;although the lights might get turned on for photos #8212;but you'd be amazed how many people like the dining venues enough to rent them out for weddings and stuff. I'm pretty sure the option was closed down for the last few years, because nobody's mentioned having to put up the pretenders while an event was going on, but it's definitely going to be big this winter. I won't have the option of making my day by coming in for two hours because I don't have a pretender, but I told Dale I want to go back on the serving staff for winter, and he said that was just fine by him, so I'll have probably enough coming in to skate through winter without needing either a second job or a dip into my savings. I'm pretty sure it says a lot about this crew that Leah's situation didn't even come up at lunch, when we all started talking about last-day park plans. We all just took it for granted that we'd be in to spend time with her and take care of her until we could get her out. She actually looked . . . relieved, if anything. I can't exactly blame her. Finishing out the last six weeks was hard as shit for her because she's been constantly second-guessing herself and her memory. Once the park starts to empty, the possibility of her lashing out will be a concern, not a danger. Lunch was wild, incidentally. I usually bring in food, and sometimes somebody else does, but this is the first time we've had food ordered from offsite, and it was courtesy of Dale, who ordered Chinese for us. He's only at lunch with us about half the time #8212;he keeps saying he's our boss, not our friend, even though at this point we're pretty sure that's him trying to uphold formalities #8212;but he was there today, and after getting a lot of shit from the rest of the actors about being a bad boyfriend he sat next to me and kept sneaking bean sprouts out of his rice and onto my plate. I was going to get revenge by returning the favor with *his* least-favorite ingredient, but the mushrooms were really good, so he got off easy. This time. He told us he'd be taking Leah all day, and asked if we could run the stagecoach robbery three times #8212;every two hours from two to six, nothing at eight because it was past sunset. Leah quietly said she'd have to sit out, and Dale shocked all of us by saying he'd go with her, if she wanted to take part in it. With Dale as a third, we didn't have to wrangle too hard to get a full gang put together for all three robberies. Leah was going off-shift early again, but Maxine offered to take Leah's spot at six so she could relax with Mr. Scratch for the last couple of hours of her shift. And so we broke for call, and headed out for one of the busiest days of the season, and everything was pretty normal until four #8212;right before I was supposed to go on break. It was the second stagecoach robbery, and with Oliver gone for the start of Hollywood dinner rush, it was just the three of us: me, Dale, and Leah. Dale couldn't come down off the roof via the porch like Oliver #8212;Oliver's a total beanpole, but Dale's not #8212;but he'd figured out shortly before the first robbery that his legs are literally long enough to step onto the shotgun rail, into the window, and straight onto the top of the coach. Given how often I saw Warin do the same fucking thing, I really kind of wonder how I never picked up on the Cowboy and Dale being related. Once you see the family resemblance, you can't unsee it. Dale definitely has a nicer nose, though. I'm not sure how different it looks, but it scrunches up when he laughs, and that's definitely an improvement. So I yelled, Dale legged up onto the stagecoach, I ran to stop Mitchell . . . . . . . and realized Leah missed the cue altogether. I'm not the world's loudest person most of the time, but I grew up singing gospel in an all-black church, and that does *things* to your lung capacity. If I need to be loud, it's not exactly hard. I couldn't imagine her not hearing me, even in-between buildings, even with the Labor Day crowds around. Dale noticed, too #8212;he had to take over Leah's demand for the gold bullion, and when he did he gave me this look: *where the hell is she?* We sped through the rest, Mitchell kind of helping us hobble along when he realized Leah wasn't with us, and taking off fast as soon as Dale dropped into the seat next to him.  #8220;Where's Leah? #8221;  #8220;We're going to have to go back and look for her. She never showed up after the cue. #8221;  #8220;I left her the same place she was at two o'clock, #8221; Dale said.  #8220;She was in my line of vision all the way up until the stagecoach pulled forward. #8221;  #8220;She was just behind mine, but I would've seen her if she'd headed out the front. She must've gone behind Doc and Kitty's. #8221; Mitchell took a turn down First.  #8220;I can drop you guys off by the devil's wheel. If she's still back that way she'll be easy to spot. #8221; The devil's wheel sounds like something really wild, but it's actually a ride that's been in the park for over a century. I'm kind of surprised it's still allowed to operate #8212;it's just this giant disk you lay on while it goes in circles and you try to hold on, until you literally fall off. It's you versus centrifugal force, and physics is going to win every time. But the devil's wheel at this park, specifically, also has a tall bridge overtop to hang the ride name on #8212;although they literally call it by its name here, The Devil's Wheel #8212;that's easily accessible by a maintenance staircase, and it's pretty useful when someone's lost. I've been up there a few times looking for wayward kids. The top of the devil's wheel didn't turn up any glimpse of Leah. Neither did a scan from the top of Doc and Kitty's. But when we cut through the space between Doc and Kitty's and the gift shop, headed back for Main, I spotted one of the cellar doors open. We'd stationed Leah next to it. Not in it. I was down in the cellar so fast Dale called after me to ask if I fell. I was too busy swearing to actually answer him, but it didn't take him more than a second to see why when he followed me. The wooden shelf was pushed open, the hallway behind it fully exposed. Dale stared at it like he thought it might eat him alive. I spotted a light at the end of the hall #8212;incredibly faint at this distance, but when there's a light in pitch-black you'll see it #8212;and headed straight for the hallway. Dale grabbed my arm with his good hand.  #8220;Nate. #8221;  #8220;I think we found her, Dale. #8221;  #8220;You know what's down there, don't you? #8221;  #8220;Dale, I've been down there. That's where I found our pictures. #8221; He gave me this kind of starey, half-panicked look, and for a second I could see him at twelve, a big-eyed kid with braces and skinned knees and a camera about to get him in a whole world of trouble. I was about to remind him the underground had to be accessed through the bathroom, and then it hit me: this wasn't the underground, but it was Warin's space, more than anywhere else in the park.  #8220;You don't have to come with me. #8221; I thought about it for a second, and what it might sound like to him.  #8220;I won't hold it against you. #8221; His grip on my arm loosened up, and I took a step away from him, toward the hallway. Then he grabbed my hand and locked his fingers through mine. Dale's one of those people who's pretty much always warm, but this time his hand was icy-cold. And shaking. But he walked next to me straight into the hallway, and when we got into the alcove he was the one who approached Leah, sitting by the dark and stagnant water.  #8220;Time to go, #8221; he said, and her shoulders kind of twitched.  #8220;It's quiet down here, #8221; she said, and looked up at the alcove ceiling above the pool.  #8220;I feel like I can hear myself. #8221;  #8220;Let's see if we can find somewhere less dangerous for you to hear yourself. #8221; Dale offered her a hand to her feet. She was still looking vaguely up at the ceiling, almost like she was daydreaming. At last she looked at me.  #8220;Did you ever know this was here? #8221; I shook my head. Leah looked upset.  #8220;It didn't call you? You never felt like you had to see it? #8221;  #8220;I didn't even know it was here until earlier this summer. #8221; Leah shook her head. She was quiet until we stepped back into the main storage room, and then she put a hand on my chest to keep me from going up the stairs. She had that same sad look she did when she told me she knew what was happening to her.  #8220;I can hear things down here that aren't me, Nathan. #8221; And then she turned and went back up the stairs. I spent my break on my laptop, trying to line up the old blueprints with Warin's lair, looking to see if there was some old forbidden structure there or something, but the best I could do was the 1898 expansion, when the area that would later be Twin Vale was first marked off as three permanent fair exhibits and structures #8212;*freak show* to the right of the modern-day entrance and *pavilion* near modern-day Second and *Indian dance powwow and Wild West marksmanship* to the left of the entrance, around the same place as Doc and Kitty's. Gotta love that old-timey casual discrimination. It looked like Warin's nest might've been beneath a supply shed for the marksmanship exhibit, probably the one where they stored clay pigeons and stuff like that. That explained its modern-day camouflage, anyway. Of course, it also assumed the entrance was always in the same place, and there wasn't an older filled-in tunnel anywhere. Now *that* was a nice, comforting thought #8212;more abandoned and mostly-hidden spots for Wild Ones to be lurking in. I checked in on Leah by text. She told me she was probably going to take Mr. Scratch offstage #8212;he was getting antsy with all the people again. *It's weird, I don't remember him ever doing this before,* she said. *He used to love holiday crowds.* *Robbery at six? Could use another gun at dinner rush.* *Nathan, the way you text, you must be on all KINDS of FBI lists.* *Apologies to the FBI for making them look at my stupid cat pictures.* Leah sent me back a line of laughing emojis, but she didn't say no to the robbery, so I took it as a tentative yes that turned into a solid one around a quarter til, when she and Maxine walkied me from the Twin Vale breakroom to pick them up. I headed their way and actually did a double-take when I spotted Maxine. Suddenly I understood exactly how she managed to tear around in that princess dress all day, hoops and all, like it wasn't anything #8212;she'd gone home on her break and gotten one of her SCA costumes, and she was standing there in a dress with a fucking *bustle.* And a corset. And a jacket. And shoes that looked like they came straight out of a Sherlock Holmes illustration. With heels. And then she introduced herself as Wild Minnie Wilson, and I just about died. If it wasn't for the evil overbosses, I'd love this job. Actually, I already do love this job. I'd just love it more without the fairies. Dale ended up tagging along with Leah again, so for the first time we ran the robbery with four people. Calling all four names was way too much for Mitchell without starting to sound like an after-school special, so he ended up gasping out  #8220;Martin Eastwood! #8221; when I stepped into his line of vision and  #8220;Harry Mansell! #8221; when Dale dropped down from the top of the carriage, and then I just gave him a giant grin and said  #8220;now, ignoring a lady isn't nice, is it? Jane, Minnie, why don't you remind this fellow of his manners? #8221; to give him a little more to work with. Getting away from the robbery was harder. There's room on the stagecoach for five people #8212;if all five are an average size. I'm pretty small, but Mitchell's a big guy, and Dale makes him look small. Ideally I would've thrown Leah and Maxine on the seat and Dale and I on the shotgun rail, but Maxine couldn't sit on her bustle because the seat wasn't open-backed, and I only had a couple of seconds to move everyone. I was about to resign myself to driving again when Leah put on that chillingly lazy outlaw's smile that made Smiling Jane such a great nickname, called Dale to the front, *and climbed on top of the carriage.* I really hoped there were people planning to post photos of it online, because I caught Dale's face when she did it, and if he'd had a camera in his hand I think he might've just said  #8220;fuck it #8221; and broken character to take a shot of Leah, skirt fanning between seat and roof, silhouetted by early-evening sun. I don't have Dale's eye for photos, but sometimes I can see *exactly* where he's coming from. It must be great, living in a world where you see that stuff all the time. And then she leaned forward, grabbed the reins out of Mitchell's hands, yelled to the horses, and we were off. I was scared shitless she was going to fall backward off the roof once we hit full speed, but as far as I could tell from the back, she didn't even waver. She didn't stop at Jack's Place, either. She actually took us the full loop around Gold and let us off by the breakroom, laughing and breathless the whole way. It was actually good to see #8212;the real total human *joy* in her laughter was so different from Warin's teasing malice in the same position. I hoped it felt as good to her doing it as it did to me watching it. Dale helped her down off the stagecoach, and all four of us piled into a giant laughing, squirming group hug. Maxine glanced up at Mitchell as the laughter calmed.  #8220;Get off your high horse, cowboy, #8221; she said, and then we started laughing again because he was in fact sitting behind a high horse. Mitchell isn't much of a hugger, but he got down and joined us anyway. When he finally got back on the coach to do one last circuit of Twin Vale before sunset, the rest of us piled into the Twin Vale breakroom to get Leah and Maxine out of their corsets and able to walk into Candyland without comment. Dale and I stripped down to our shirts and jeans, and we all headed for the castle to see Leah safely upstairs. She stopped us outside the employee entrance. The smile on her face was sad . . . but peaceful.  #8220;I don't know if I'll ever get to do that again, #8221; she said. Maxine opened her mouth, probably to say something like *of course you'll do it again,* and Leah shook her head to stop her before she started.  #8220;I might not . . . be here, by the time next season starts. But for the first time all summer I don't feel afraid. I don't want to go, but after today . . . it's okay. So . . . thank you. All of you. Nathan, you'll thank Mitchell for me, right? #8221;  #8220;You can thank him yourself tomorrow at lunch, and we're going to have you driving the damned thing on opening day next spring just like today. #8221; I took her face in my hands again.  #8220;It isn't too late. I asked #8212;Dale, *Jesus!* #8221; I rubbed my side. You wouldn't expect a guy as big as Dale to have elbows like that.  #8220;I'm just going to advise you to think for ten seconds about what you were about to say, and ask yourself if you think it's a good idea for your general physical wellbeing to say it. #8221; I stopped and thought about it. Then I sighed.  #8220;It's a fucking contract thing, isn't it? #8221;  #8220;It is, in fact, a fucking contract thing. #8221;  #8220;Shit. #8221; I sighed. Then I looked at Leah again.  #8220;Let's leave it at this, then, don't go giving up on yourself just yet. #8221; I kissed her forehead, and she threw her arms around me and kissed my cheek. Then she let go and did the same thing to Dale before giving Maxine a hug so tight I was surprised she didn't tell Leah to let up on her ribs.  #8220;I'm probably going to watch the fireworks from up here because it was a really great view last time. You guys can totally come up if you want, but I won't promise I'm not going to fall asleep on you. #8221;  #8220;Just don't fall out the window, #8221; Dale told her.  #8220;I'm sure that's not how the cleaning staff want to finish the main season. #8221;  #8220;Ugh, *Dale!* #8221; Leah made a terrible face at him. Then she ran up the stairs, stopped at the top, and waved us goodnight. I heard from her one more time before fireworks #8212;around 7:30, telling me she was exhausted and thought she was just going to call it a night. I told her to sleep well, and she sent me a couple of hearts and a sleeping face. I passed it on to Dale. He met me in Hollywood again about an hour later. He was still in his Twin Vale costume #8212;minus the gunbelt, anyway #8212;and I had to fight not to laugh. Men's clothing in Western frontier times was close enough to modern designs he more or less looked like he'd just walked in off one of the local farms, but Dale is so completely not a vest guy most of the time.  #8220;Twin Vale shut down? #8221;  #8220;Almost totally. I announced fireworks and it cleared out like *that.* #8221; I looked up at the speakers around the Hollywood main plaza, and the people starting to gather. A few of them were dancing #8212;enjoying the breeze and the evening break from the late-summer humidity, I guessed.  #8220;Didn't we do this like two months ago, but with way worse music? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; Dale suddenly stopped, like he was a computer program that'd frozen up #8212;the way somebody does when something just hits them.  #8220;That was the day I realized I had to decide whose side I was on, anyway. I can't believe it's been two months. #8221;  #8220;Whose side? #8221; He shook his head.  #8220;Forget about it. #8221;  #8220;I'm in the contract now, you can't just blow me off that easily, Dale. #8221;  #8220;Then forget about it until tomorrow, okay? #8221; He stopped and took a look at me #8212;a good, long look, like he wanted to be sure I knew he was serious.  #8220;I don't remember the last time I actually enjoyed a day. I'm worried like hell about Leah, and tomorrow's going to suck because it's time for maintenance paperwork, but today . . . today was good. The first good one in a really long time. Maybe the first really good one in ten years. So let's just leave serious shit alone for now. #8221; I nodded up at him, then hugged him. He hugged me back. I'm not quite sure how we got from there to slow-dancing in front of Casablanca, but we did. I took off my hat and plopped it on Dale's head for lack of a better place to put it, and he started laughing. And then I heard something behind me that made me freeze #8212;a little kid's voice.  #8220;Hey, mom, the cowboys are dancing! #8221; I stopped. Even in this big a crowd, it'd be easy for things to get nasty incredibly fast.  #8220;Leave them alone, Jayden, they've probably had a very long day. #8221;  #8220;But why are they dancing? #8221;  #8220;Because they want to. Finish your Gatorade. #8221; I let out a breath I didn't even realize I was holding. I've been trying to get used to it all summer, but hearing some mother I didn't even know just dismiss us as part of the background scenery was when it really hit me: it's been ten years. Things are different. Food, music, even the park, it's all changed. But tonight, when the Hollywood lights went down and the fireworks went up, I got to dance in the middle of a crowd that completely minded its own damned business, which only kind of happened at the concerts I used to frequent and happened not at all at prom. Nobody threatened us, nobody stared except a couple of people you could tell were doing the *someday I want that* thing. They didn't have any idea what we're struggling with right now, but it was kind of nice, being somebody else's dream instead of their punchline. Tomorrow is the first time all summer I'll have a full day off to actually sit for hours, for as long as it takes, and research until my eyeballs fall out if I have to. I don't know if I'll be in the park or working somewhere else, but I'm not stopping until I have an answer to help Leah. Tonight I got to spend a few minutes in the life I might've had, uninterrupted, if the park hadn't had other ideas. It sounds kind of sad when I put it that way, but it really wasn't. It was just . . . peaceful. I hope it lasts.  #8203; \[Part 25\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gq99c1/i\_used\_to\_be\_a\_stagecoach\_driver\_and\_now\_im\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gq99c1/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The person who posted these is Korean. In several Asian languages (I'm aware of it being a thing in Japanese, Korean, and Burmese, but may also exist in others), the L and R sound are identical--there are no separate characters for them. As a result, people who speak these languages may not differentiate between L and R in writing. (You don't even have to have poor English skills for this to be an issue. I'm a Yu-Gi-Oh fan and we have one pair of characters in one of the spinoffs who have *three different official spellings* of their names because it depends on whether you choose to read specific characters as L/R and C/K.)  #8203; It's probably just a language barrier. That's likely also why the price on the ticket looks so low--I just checked one of those "tips for visiting Korea" websites and I'm having a bit of trouble because it appears to have been written in Korean and then Google-translated to English, but *if* I'm reading it right, the price on that ticket is actually intended to be $25 USD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's no problem, I figured you didn't know so that's why I commented  lt;3 A lot of people who don't speak any languages with non-Latin alphabets have no idea *how fucking ridiculously gahdamn hard* it is to transliterate, because most other alphabets are either based on full syllables rather than single phonemes (e.g. in Japanese #12288; #12373; is actually the sound "sah," transliterated "sa" and pronounced like the end of "Sansa") or they make weird distinctions not present in English (I speak Hebrew, and a *really* fun one to try to explain is the difference between  #1492; and  #1499;, which to most English-speakers are apparently interchangeable even though *they are completely not*), or English has distinctions that language's alphabet doesn't have (like the difference between L and R).  #8203; And that's before you even get into languages where every character means a specific word!

    <TEXT>All this is true, but there's also this:  #8203; You can't necessarily control what sets your fun bits going, and sometimes it's some pretty fucked-up stuff.  #8203; Psychiatrists have long puzzled over the fact that far and away the #1 most common sexual fantasy among women is rape. Even when you adjust variables for sexual abuse victims, cultures, etc., it's rape. Why? Well, if you can definitively and positively answer that question, several thousand sexual-health researchers really, *really* want to talk to you, because they would genuinely fucking love to know.  #8203; It's totally possible to look at Warin/Leah and go "he's a fucking sicko" and at the same time be turned on by the concept of the exotic, the danger, even the fact that he apparently gets off on controlling and humiliating others. And it isn't necessarily a reflection on anyone's character to be turned on by it.  #8203; Like, personal thoughts on Leah/Warin? I don't like it and it actually makes me a little sick. (I had an insanely hard time writing about Warin's cave in Stagecoach. It made for some great plot, but oh, G-d. There's still stuff about the cave I *have* to come back to instead of leaving it loose and I so totally do not want to.) But I'm also not going to judge anyone for going "I am completely aware he's a fucking creep, but my nethers disagree."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think what you're saying here is walking dangerously close to the idea that people can only read things that are "pure" and "good" and "untarnished," and that isn't how the real world works--nor is it how fiction works.  #8203; There's plenty of published literature out there that *actually* glorifies abuse. *Fifty Shades of Grey* comes to mind. So does *A Song of Ice and Fire* and its TV counterpart, Game of Thrones. Nothing about Cryptic Park is glorified.  #8203; I really don't think a few people fantasizing about something dark in an internet story is something to get "fucked up" over. I'm also pretty sure about 100% of the people who ship canon or near-canon Leah/Warin are *completely* aware of how awful the relationship dynamic would be in the real world, and would have a problem with it if it were happening in the real world. (And I say that as someone who doesn't ship it even in AUs.) Sometimes, however, you just want to watch the world burn, and fiction (especially fanfiction) is a great place to do that.  #8203; YKINMKATO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>. . . . . that is the most . . . . *interesting* combination of words I have ever heard in regard to kink tomato.  #8203; It's basically a way to pronounce YKINMKATO, which is a fandom acronym from the 90s and early 2000s. Stands for "your kink is not my kink, and that's okay." The name "kink tomato" comes from the fact that the words "kink" and "mato" appear within the acronym in almost perfect succession, and we were all kind of on crack in fandom back then. Yes, even 11-year-old tiny Nina.  #8203; Also, I wasn't going to say this here because it's pretty personal, but I'm a total trash gremlin about keeping my subs separate via usernames, so anybody who backreads my history enough can find it anyway: I'm saying this as a rape survivor. ***The fiction you consume does not always reflect on what you would find acceptable or pleasing in real life.***  #8203; Leah/Warin grosses me out to the extreme. (To pull another useful phrase from the days when we rated our fanfiction with a fruit scale, it deeply fucking squicks me.) But here's the cool thing, *nobody is forcing me to read it. Or look at art of it.* I can mind my own damn business and just keep scrolling. Hell, if the original story had been too far ruined for me by how turning works, *I could've stopped reading that, too.* I am an adult who knows how a back button works. As long as nobody here is actually trying to step on unconsenting people to spit in their mouths, we're all good. And I trust the people on this sub to be mature enough to know that in real life, that behavior wouldn't be okay.</TEXT>

I'm currently running a quest in Fallout 4.  #8203; In real life would I actually go around gleefully setting people on fire and then firing from a sniper position? Hell no. (In real life the only gun I've ever fired was a .22 and the last time I did it was 15 years ago. In real life I'm total rubbish at gardening, too. Not only do I have no interest in doing these things in real life, I don't even possess the skill set.) Do I do it frequently and with great abandon in-game? Oh yes. Sometimes I even yell things at the feral ghouls like "here's your fucking extra hot sauce, Karen" before I throw my Molotov cocktails, which I hope approximately zero people take as me getting ready to shoot up my place of work. But it's deeply therapeutic when it's on a screen.  #8203; The same can be said for kink. On the page, Warin/Leah might be deeply hot to some people, who at the same time would look at a real-life assaulter and be ready to shiv the dude--and who would really, really like to know *why* it turns them on when it's on the page.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You raise another good point about how ships work. I tend to be the "imagine them happy together" type, but there are absolutely people who ship for all kinds of reasons. Shit, I have a fandom where I ship two people who not only never meet, *they're never even in the same fucking city.* And one of them is a villain. I just think it'd be fun to watch him get taken down six and a half pegs by the lady in this ship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh no I didn't take it that way! It was more "yep, we all have our reasons."  #8203; And absolutely. I hang out in Yu-Gi-Oh fandom and my two big ships are rival and puppy. Or: Kaiba/Atem and Kaiba/Jyonouchi. The latter of which, if you take canon and freeze their development, would be *deeply* abusive. But if you let them continue to grow along the tracks their arcs lead in (especially Kaiba), you can totally end with it working. Sometimes it's nice to watch the world burn and sometimes it's nice to watch the world *work.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Fanfiction Author, But Today I'm Not: Park Blueprints [Twin Vale Edition]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 14:15:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm due to get my stitches out today, but they were kind of sore and I didn't feel like trying to put together a whole damn chapter with them still in. (Stitches-sore is like nothing else you've ever felt. Plus you have to work around little pieces of plastic *in your damn finger.*)  #8203; As luck would have it, however, I'm left-handed, and my stitches are in my right hand. I've had a couple of people ask if I was working from blueprints in Stagecoach Driver because I seem to have a very elaborate and consistent setup.  #8203; The answer is yes.  #8203; See, the biggest gift /u/girl_from_the_crypt gave me in canon was going "here are some basic indications, but the rest? It's free real estate." Creating full blueprints and doing an obscene amount of research on amusement parks is absolutely mild compared to some of the shit I've done for fanfiction (including but not limited to: learning to speak Middle Egyptian, developing an entire conlang plus two dialects and a written alphabet, and living for a week with my left hand constantly behind my back to determine how someone with a malfunctioning, and also deeply secret, cybernetic arm would have to live while trying to fix it).  #8203; My blueprints were on the same paper I use to create my crochet patterns, which means they were very small, obscured by a grid, and pretty ugly. I decided if I was sharing them, I was going to make them actually usable for people who are not me.  #8203; So I dropped $25 on a roll of butcher paper to make full-size blueprints and building sketches. (I am justifying this with "it was my fucking money which I earned, I love the way butcher paper sounds when you unroll it, I will do *so many fucking crafts* with this and also did I mention it was my fucking money which I earned.")  #8203; I have discovered that I also had a plethora of errors in my originals, many (but not all) of which were caused by trying to use rectangular paper for roughly-square plans, so transferring them over to the better paper is going to be a project and a half but will make for much better blueprints.  #8203; AND NOW THE FEATURE PRESENTATION 1. While I've tried to account for all the canonical features no matter how big or small, these blueprints are *not* canonical. They are the map and historical timeline I'm using for Stagecoach Driver, nothing more. 2. You are free to use them, if you want! Please note that because I'm using a school ruler and a drafting compass made out of a pair of knitting needles, absolutely *none* of this is to scale. (A note specific to Twin Vale: yes, the spacing on the roads is deliberate. If you move things around in your head you'll be able to see that when Twin Vale was first sectioned out in the 1910s, a fourth road was planned but never built. For those following along with Stagecoach Driver who've already gotten to Rick's and Dale's altered blueprints, the answer to the question you may be asking in your head is "yes, and it was the stagecoach.") 3. Transcripts on the ride and building notes will be provided because I know my handwriting is kind of small, but you guys are going to have to find the actual names of places yourselves. 4. With one exception (listed in the notes), all dates are 100% accurate and the rides in question could in fact have been installed in the years given. 5. Additional lore will also be provided so you guys don't have to spend a week hunting down obscure Wikipedia links and translating things out of German. 6. The other parks will also be transferred to butcher paper for you to look at if you want, yes. But it's going to take a bit of time.  #8203; WITHOUT FURTHER ADO:  #8203; [The full Twin Vale map, featuring my super-lame not-actually-a-drafting-compass up top](https://preview.redd.it/xc0b1rpy8xz41.jpg?width=3024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=e7603cf543760bbeaaee8167eb525278237d9325)  #8203;  #8203; [Western Twin Vale](https://preview.redd.it/2mwm9h449xz41.jpg?width=3024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=c08f97470613de6369e75d0a6fd0b4a5902d5859)  #8203;  #8203;  #8203; [Southern Twin Vale](https://preview.redd.it/g87zq6xa9xz41.jpg?width=3024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=82914bdb4dc9396bda5d3e1c341631c0c70a913d)  #8203; [Eastern Twin Vale](https://preview.redd.it/f976sfad9xz41.jpg?width=3024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=9f7d76ab23230fd163ba40c0c39e44522c14794f)  #8203; [Northern Twin Vale](https://preview.redd.it/r9wwt3nj9xz41.jpg?width=3024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=e5abfea8f0ed3267a17154c07e909bb1b48c8a83)  #8203; And now the transcripts, because . . . my handwriting. Transcripts will begin at the Twin Vale entrance (at the bottom of the Southern Twin Vale image) and go around each section in a clockwise direction. Transcripts will start at the main plaza and work out toward the edges.  #8203; 1. Olde Time Photo/picture booth. You get to dress up in goofy Wild West costumes and take photos. I didn't note it on the blueprint, but this would've gone up in the 1920s, when getting your photo taken was still something of a novelty. 2. Sodas - Ices - Chocolate. Ice cream parlor, named "Delilah's" in park files. The name of this small cafe doesn't actually appear on the building. The "chocolate" referred to is drinking chocolate, not the kind you eat. 3. Flying coaster/"bump." Installed 1917, manager John. Only original flying coaster remaining in US. (There is now a completely different extreme ride called the flying coaster.) If you try to find it on the Internet, you won't--the manufacturer has been out of business for *decades* and the ride is basically no longer in existence. (The one at my local amusement park, which we called--you guessed it--The Bump, was removed and replaced in 1995.) The original Flying Coaster was a series of cars attached to a central hydraulic post, running around a track like a small roller coaster. At several points in the track, there was a small raised hill or bump, and when the car hit it, it would fly up into the air--hence the name "Flying Coaster." I spent a few hours trying to find a single other example of this ride anywhere in the world but Waldameer, and couldn't. My installation date for the ride is based on the appearance of the Waldameer Flying Coaster, since no apparent record of the ride exists. 4. Skyride. Installed 1992, manager Rick. This is an open-air gondola lift, allowing a full view of Twin Vale when the ride reaches its midpoint by Olde Time Photo. 5. Pretzels - Popcorn. A fair snack food kiosk featuring the named items and also candied and caramel apples, cotton candy, and fudge. This is simply a numbered kiosk in park files. 6. "Top of the World." Installed 1949, manager Robert. This is an Eyerly Roll-O-Plane. Only three or four of these are still known to exist. 7. Doc and Kitty's. Serves alcohol. Twin Vale fine dining. This is the large saloon mentioned in the original story. 8. The Devil's Wheel. Installed 1913, manager John. I honestly have no idea if this ride would even be legal in the US these days because the whole point of it is to sit on a disk while it spins and you try to not get knocked off by centrifugal force or a giant ball and the last person still on the disk wins something, but let's be real, does this family care if it's legal? 9. "Haunted Swing." Installed 1924, manager Robert. This is the first construction Robert completed in his tenure as manager. Explaining how this ride works is *incredibly* difficult, but basically you're in a dark room and the walls and floor move and through the magic of physics it feels like you're being turned upside down and flipped when actually you're sitting on a flat plane and the room is moving around you. 10. Gift shop. Self-explanatory. 11. Warin. This is the cellar that leads into his lair. 12. Twin Vale Express. Train, installed 1931, manager Robert. It's just a fun little train that takes you around part of Twin Vale and runs out along Gold Street. 13. "The Caterpillar." Installed 1921, manager John. This is the last construction in John's tenure as manager. I've also noted it as the subject of urban legends, because original Caterpillars are in fact exactly that: there are two known to still exist in the US, but every few years rumors surface of somebody seeing one, not necessarily operational, in some backwater park somewhere. *Of course* one of them would be in this park. 14. Kids' rides. I didn't actually lay out what kind of kids' rides these are. If you've ever been to an amusement park, you know the kinds of rides they have for little-littles. That's what these are. 15. Bathrooms. They're bathrooms. Placed near the kiddie rides for what I hope are obvious reasons. 16. Across the street: horse pasture. 17. Across the street: three-in-one building. From left to right: maintenance (including an area behind heavy wire for storing the go-kart and heavy equipment, and an interior for regular tools and electronics), storage for props/costumes/onsite laundry/spare tack for the stagecoach, and the breakroom, with both a bathroom and a shower.  #8203; Just so you guys don't get lost, we're at the top of the map now and we're going to be to the right of Main Street.  #8203; 18) Mechanical bull riding. Installed 1974, manager Brandy. 19) Pretzels - Popcorn. Same as #5. 20) "The Waltzer." Installed 1942, manager Robert. This would be the last construction on park grounds until 1947, due to WWII, and the last construction in Twin Vale until 1949. (This ride is super cool, you guys. It's like a bigger version of a Tilt-A-Whirl and I want to ride one now *so bad*, but apparently they're really rare now outside Germany.) 21) Across the street: "Miner's Run." Installed 1927, manager Robert. This is a Prior and Church coaster. It's similar to the Coney Island "Cyclone," which wasn't a Prior and Church construction but was designed by one of their workers (and is similar enough to Prior and Church works that it's often mistakenly classified as one).  #8203; This is kind of a weird jump because Miner's Run is way the hell and gone up in the far right corner, so for reference's sake, we're now in the right-hand wedge between First and Union.  #8203; 22) Gift Shop/Leathersmith. Self-explanatory. Come shop for stuff, get custom leather goods. Do not ask the leathersmith to make you BDSM gear. You will be turned down. (Even if you're Dale, who did not actually want BDSM cuffs, just "my boyfriend is a wannabe emo and that plastic shit from Hot Topic is destroying his wrists" cuffs, and who is never going to live down his own poor communication skills.) 23) Bathrooms. They're bathrooms. Placed by the picnic pavilions for what I hope are obvious reasons. 24) Picnic pavilions. If you decided to bring your own food, or you just want to sit somewhere nice but also outdoors while you eat, this is where you go. 25) "Mighty Rio Grande." Log flume ride. I listed this as an "Old Mill variant" because I wasn't paying attention, but it's actually an Old Mill *replacement.* (Old Mill rides were the predecessor to the log flume.) It was installed in 1965, manager Robert. This is a Schwarzkopf flume, and the last of Robert's construction during his tenure as manager. 26) "Texas Spin." Installed 1955, manager Robert. This is an Eyerly Octopus ride. 27) Shooting gallery. Just like the ones you'd find on any midway in America, except it's bigger because it's standalone. Shoot enough targets, win a prize. 28) Bathrooms. They're bathrooms. 29) Jack's Place. Serves alcohol. This is Nathan's go-to for good barbecue and a drink when he's trying to escape work crowds for ten minutes. It's the smaller saloon mentioned in the original story. 30) Madame Fortuna. Fortune-teller, because of course she is. 31) Twin Vale General Goods. Western-style grocery. Park BBQ sauce, penny candy, bottled drinks, jams, etc. Basically you stop here if you need a water bottle or liked something in one of the Twin Vale restaurants and want to take it home, and they also sell a few by-the-item things like an actual Western general goods store, like penny candy and pickles. 32) "The Whip." Installed 1919, manager John.  #8203; TO THE EAST: CANDYLAND TO THE SOUTH: HOLLYWOOD TO THE WEST: HORROR</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EEP  #8203; I'm sorry I'm so incredibly bad at taking compliments  #8203; So the original was on a piece of grid paper, because in the chapter of Stagecoach where Nathan describes the layout of Twin Vale I suddenly realized I'd transposed three different buildings in my head, so I literally just grabbed my crochet notebook and started scribbling. It was pretty ugly and took like 30 minutes, but I added to it a little at a time as I went.  #8203; This one took about three hours, but that's mostly because I'm not used to being able to draw on such a huge scale. It's roughly 24"x24", and I kept making things WAY TOO SMALL. (Also, I was trying to convert a rectangular drawing of a round space to a square paper, which, um. Eep.)  #8203; ALSO I FORBID YOU FROM FEELING BAD I HAD SO MUCH FUCKING FUN WITH THIS. Worldbuilding is where my heart lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, yes, but all of my work comes with a crushing sense of "Nina you really need to work with your therapist on this and start *accepting you can fucking do things.*" (I say as though I haven't at least gotten to the point I can say "I'm bad at accepting compliments" instead of "no, I'm really not that good" and meaning it.) It's a work in progress. Also usually I write fanfiction for stuff that's originally Japanese, so the odds the creators will ever see my stuff are like . . . nonexistent. It's very weird to be in a position where I'm not only talking to the original creator, that original creator doesn't have to worry about the whole lawsuit thing and so is actively participating with fanworks. Not like "ew I don't like this" weird, but like . . . damn, that is *never* gonna be a thing in most of my fandoms weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm working on it! Someday I'm actually going to put out a book and be like "look, I did a thing." That's the actual ultimate endgoal. Assuming I can stop Tolkienning stuff.  #8203; Honestly? If you wanted to edit it into a book, *you could.* It's incredibly well-written, the plot is great (someone on the cryptid-fucker-support-group discord server, which is a sentence clause I can't believe I just typed, pointed out there's a hidden twist within the ending a few days ago and my brain fucking *exploded*), and like . . . your characters are *compelling.* Leah doesn't really have character development in the "follows a growing arc" sense (the fact that she trusts Madeleine tells you outright that she has learned *nothing*), and yet you don't sit there going "ugh, what a dumbass Leah is, why doesn't she figure this out" but rather "Leah! Dammit! Come on you're so smart *why is this the thing that's tripping you up??*" just like you would with a real person.  #8203; Also I've read it for free and I'd totally preorder it at a bookshop just for the pleasure of having it on my shelf to reread in bed at will. I don't even do that for my Stephen King books. So if you want to know what kind of potential audience you'd have, like. I'm ready to go drop twenty bucks *on something I read for free.*  #8203; *\^////\^* In all seriousness, though, who *doesn't* love Nathan? Like early on you introduced us to his backstory and I was like "please tell me he's not going to be a background character, please tell me he's going to be a major character . . . . " almost instantly. You made him sad without making him pathetic, which is something a lot of media seems to struggle with these days. I'm just glad you think I'm living up to the amazingness you put out.  #8203; Also I still find it hilarious I meant for this thing to be like six to ten parts and *here we fucking are.* Closing in on the ending, but still.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not the asshole. This is an integral part of your husband-to-be's culture (mazel tov, by the way!), he has indicated it is incredibly important to him, and you're standing up for him. All he is saying is "I would like to be seen" and you are saying "This is the man I love, see him." If anything I'd say it makes you not just "not the asshole," but whatever an anti-asshole might be called. Far too many spouses-to-be would say "honey, I know it's important, but I *reaaaaally* want my parents at our wedding . . ." and force him to choose between his culture and his bride. The fact that you're insisting he has the right to include what's important to him says a lot about your character, and it's all good.  #8203; I would suggest you take a quiet night for yourself to think about your parents' reaction and ask how it might play out down the line, because to me it sounds deeply racist. (I mean, at a bare minimum--your child is asking to spend time with you before the wedding! Why would you object to *anything* related to that?) The fact that they're refusing to participate in a ritual that's deeply important to your husband disturbs me. It may be best to make your distance now and see if there's another family member, mentor, or close friend who'd be willing to take your parents' place at the tea ceremony. I know my sister's dad was a deadbeat, and at her wedding she danced with our grandfather for the father-of-the-bride dance. It wasn't "the same," but it was deeply special and meaningful to her anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you grow up inside a family, it can be hard to see until you have a little distance (like the kind that forms as you're starting your own separate family circle). Like--I'm not proud of this, but I grew up knowing the N-word as "it's not about black people! It's about a certain kind of poor character!" (The kind the wider world might call "ratchet" today, which is a word that has all kinds of its own problems, but point being--there is not now nor was there ever any need to use the N-word.) I was in college before I was very harshly corrected. It's totally possible that it wasn't until OP had another culture as part of her everyday life that she went "wow, this is concerning," without being any reflection on her character. It's also possible that she was like "my parents are kind of narrow, but surely not THAT narrow," only to be sadly mistaken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're welcome. If it's something you haven't had to think about, you probably come from a far less dysfunctional family than mine, which is both a blessing (you don't have to deal with this shit!) and a curse (you have no idea this shit is out there, and it can narrow your perspective). I hope OP is able to sort this out. I can't imagine saying "no, I don't want to be part of a traditional ceremony to be welcomed into your spouse's family." Like if I had a kid getting married and I was invited to this I'd be like "yes! What's the dress code? If it's that important I want to get something special to wear" without a second thought.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm An Independent Contractor [Part 25]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-25 11:18:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gmou6f/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; Some days, I really think we're going to come out on top of this thing. This was one of those days. My day actually started last night. I got home from fireworks and couldn't settle down #8212;not after a shower, a cup of chamomile, prep for jambalaya, and even a Benadryl, which I swear left me even more awake than I was before. Finally I grabbed Storkie and Leah's car keys and drove over to the apartment. I was going to let myself in and hopefully nap on the sofa, but I'd barely settled in under the lap blanket Dale keeps on the sofa before he wandered into the living room in the direction of the bathroom, and on his way back he spotted me.  #8220;Nate? #8221;  #8220;Couldn't sleep. #8221;  #8220;And you're on the sofa because . . . . ? #8221;  #8220;I didn't want to wake you. #8221; Dale made this kind of noise at me that was like the audio equivalent of rolling his eyes. Then he bent down and scooped me off the sofa, which is one of the things I actually really love about being small. He settled me into bed, tucked Storkie under my arm and then crawled in next to me and put his arms around me.  #8220;What's on your mind? #8221;  #8220;Leah. Wondering if things are going to change now the main season's over. Wondering how much time I've got left. I think at this point I'm looking in the wrong place entirely and I've been wasting time all summer. I got distracted by a wild goose chase. #8221;  #8220;Goose chase, or information you don't know how to use yet? #8221;  #8220;What do you mean? #8221;  #8220;Park's been around for almost 150 years. I don't know any more about this than you do, but it wouldn't surprise me if the answer is tangled up with the history. #8221; He kissed my forehead.  #8220;There's nothing you can do at . . . whatever the hell hour it is. Late. Get some sleep. We'll put our heads together in the morning and see what we can come up with. #8221; Either I'm the most pathetic person on the face of the planet, or I'm more exhausted than I know I am, because I'm pretty sure there was another sentence after that but I was out already. Dale was as good as his word, because when I woke up his side of the bed was mostly cold but I could smell coffee and a stumble into the breakfast nook showed me both his notes and mine stacked up next to each other with my glasses on top. Dale was trying very hard to make toast. I don't know how he does it, I'll set the toaster to make toast perfectly, he'll throw in some bread, touch *nothing,* and what he gets out will either be untoasted or charcoal. I used to tease him and say he was cursed, but it's not so funny anymore. Apparently he's made at least somewhat of a truce with the toaster, too, because when he set a plate of toast next to the coffee carafe on the table it was dark but not inedible. Nothing I couldn't cover up with jelly, anyway.  #8203; If he noticed I waited for him to drink his coffee before I took mine, he didn't say so. He settled in across from me, and we ate our toast and coffee in the kind of quiet that builds up when you're not really awake enough for conversation yet. Dale finished his second cup of coffee, sighed, and sat back before reaching out and taking his notebook.  #8220;I've needed to show you this for a couple of weeks, #8221; he said.  #8220;I didn't want to. Felt like if you didn't know what was in here, I'd be able to protect you. But it's the other way around. The less you know, the more danger you're in. I learned that the way-too-fucking-hard way. #8221;  #8220;What is it? #8221;  #8220;The contract is in it. #8221;  #8220;The original one? #8221;  #8220;And the amended one. #8221; I stared at the little notebook.  #8220;I didn't know spiral notebooks existed 150 years ago. #8221;  #8220;Funny. No, this is mine. I'm sure other managers have had their own. I know my dad had a binder instead. #8221;  #8220;So that's it. The heart of the whole thing? #8221;  #8220;So, uh. #8221; Dale sighed the kind of sigh you hear when somebody's about to explain something they really don't want to and aren't quite sure how to, like how they happened to cheat on you or where all the missing money is or what, exactly, is in a notebook about making deals with evil fairies. He tapped the first page.  #8220;A lot of this stuff is probably totally irrelevant to what you want. Park balances, stuff like that. A lot of the things we'd consider relevant to the contract were either vague or never explained. Like how often sacrifices have to be made or what the criteria are for selection. That'd be useful to know, but nobody ever explained. We've put together a little information based on what we've seen, but we're more or less in the dark. #8221;  #8220;Did they ever explain *what* sacrifices had to be? #8221; Dale stopped between sentences and stared up at me.  #8220;What . . . ? #8221;  #8220;There isn't a whole lot out there on fae in America, but what I've found from Ireland and Germany says you can do things like leaving bread and cream on the doorstep. I've done it a couple times in the park when I thought I might be trespassing and I'm pretty sure it actually worked. Do sacrifices have to be living beings? Or was that a certain somebody's invention? #8221; I've surprised Dale before. Multiple times, in multiple ways, even. This was the first time I left him so speechless he just sat there with his mouth hanging open.  #8220;I'm just saying, I'm wondering how many problems we'd solve by taking some fruit to the underground entrance a few times a week. Has anybody ever, you know, *tested* this stuff? #8221; I took his continued gapemouthed silence as a no. Then I wrote his answer, or lack of it, down in my own notes.  #8220;Probably not going to help with Leah, but it's good to know. #8221; I took his notebook again and flipped through some of the numbers. At last I reached actual words, and Dale took it back from me. Or laid it down on the table between us, at least. The contract, as it was originally written, was maddeningly vague. Three guardians of the property, rendered voiceless,  #8220;occasional #8221; sacrifices, and the phrase Leah mentioned in her blog: *we who now take ownership of this land are aware of and willing to pay the price.* Something about it bothered me, and I wrote it down. I need to show it to someone. I'm not entirely sure who, but I know I know somebody who can explain what's wrong with that statement, and I'm pretty sure everything hangs off it. The major amendment to the contract wouldn't be any help to Leah, because it was made after her turning, but it's still a start: sacrifices to come only from within  #8220;the owners. #8221; Which I guess means I'm still in danger, but if there's one thing I've figured out from reading fairy tales and old folklore all summer, it's that words-lawyering is basically an Olympic sport for the fae. I'm going to have to get good at it, and fast, but it's still something that might be in my favor. I didn't share any of this with Leah. Not yet. It's good information, but I don't know yet what I'm supposed to *do* with it, and I don't want to do that to her. So instead when we went in today I took her food and demanded the right to watch Casino Royale with her, because, I told her, she wasn't allowed to introduce me to blonde James Bond and then not follow through. I really hope it's enough to go on. I've got to figure out what's up with that sentence. I *know* the answer is there.  #8203;  #8203; [Part 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gsu34s/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like there's something about the grammar. One of those trick question things like "man without her woman is nothing" or how you can say "I didn't take the money" and whichever word in the sentence you emphasize changes the meaning. I just have to figure out what it is. My strong subject was math, not English.  #8203; And you're not wrong about Dale. I can tell he's trying to get sober again, but it's a hell of a lot harder for him than I'd expect if the problem was just alcoholism without anything else going on. For that matter, I'm not even sure he *is* an alcoholic. Alcoholics don't say they don't have the luxury of getting drunk.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm In Pain [Part 26]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-29 14:34:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 25](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gq99c1/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) Today fucking sucked. Not for any reasons related to the Wild Ones, it's just sometimes things suck. It started out so well. We met in King Arthur's, because Casablanca staff was prepping for a wedding party. I'd finally given in to Darius' near-begging, and made fried chicken. I hate making fried chicken because it's one of those dishes that goes to hell if you so much as breathe wrong while you're making it #8212;which you wouldn't expect out of something people imitate with Shake n Bake, but it's true #8212;but it's really rare he actually requests anything specific for lunch. Dale joined us, and he was the one who asked Leah if she was okay. She'd grabbed a plate, and she'd demolished her sweet potato fries in about ten seconds flat, but she was barely picking at her chicken. I craned to look at it.  #8220;It's not raw, is it? Because I'm pretty sure everything hit temp, but #8212; #8221; Leah shook her head.  #8220;I just really kind of want strawberries. #8221; She pushed the plate back.  #8220;Actually I *really* want strawberries. But, you know . . .  #8221; She shrugged. I gave Dale this *what-the-fuck-do-I-do* look, and then three things hit me and once and I jumped up from the table.  #8220;Kitchen's open, right? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. Nathan, what are you #8212; #8221; I'd love to say I planned to sound mysterious and dramatic when I said  #8220;Hamelin-town #8221; and dropped my notebook in front of Dale before running off, but actually I just assumed he'd know what I meant and it wasn't until later that he told me he thought I might be having some kind of breakdown. I couldn't find a food scale in the King Arthur's kitchen, so I had to estimate a little, but it still didn't take me too long to get back to the dining room and drop a pair of plates on the table.  #8220;Okay. Listen and don't argue. #8221; I pushed one of the plates at her.  #8220;Leah, you need to take this to the bathroom in Hollywood. Leave it outside the door. Dale, she's gonna need your keys. And probably somebody to go with her. #8221; I've been the weird one in a lot of places in my life, but this is the first time I've had almost a dozen people staring at me like I'd lost my mind. I rolled my eyes.  #8220;Okay, fine, so Dale told me this story, and I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to share it, but I was thinking about it and then I thought of a different thing and put those together with another thing and I think I know how Leah can eat fruit again, and no, I can't make it any clearer than that without probably having to go stab myself or something. #8221;  #8220;Needs cream, #8221; Oliver said.  #8220;You're going for first fruits, right? #8221;  #8220;For what now? #8221;  #8220;First fruits. You know, first fruit of the harvest, first slice of bread, that kind of thing. You're supposed to do it with cream. Or beer. Cream's probably easier to get in Candyland. #8221; I headed back to the kitchen. I couldn't find any cream, but I found some half-and-half, and I was most of the way through piling some into a dish to take to the table when both my hands lifted off the dish of their own accord. *Fuck.* I waited to see what they were going to do to me. Then my hands dropped back to the dish. Okay. A warning. Probably a *don't go any further in what you say.* Warning noted. I took the cream back to the table. Dale gave me this wide-eyed look.  #8220;Nate #8212; #8221;  #8220;I'm good. #8221; I dropped the dish in front of Oliver, who'd apparently spent the last five minutes explaining traditional fae sacrifices, because when he started opening half-and-half cups and pouring them over the strawberries nobody seemed surprised. Then he pushed the dish to Leah.  #8220;Don't eat *any* of this, #8221; he told her.  #8220;The other dish is yours. We should probably send somebody to Hollywood with you. #8221; Then he looked at Dale.  #8220;If this doesn't work, how soon are we going to know we fucked up? #8221;  #8220;Instantly. Or close to it. #8221; Dale looked grim.  #8220;Leah, I can't stop you, but really think about this before you do it. #8221;  #8220;You know what? #8221; She met his eyes across the table, and I could see why he gave in to her demand for answers the first time.  #8220;I'm okay with it. I can't go to the gym. I can't make most of my own food. I can't leave a mile-square area and I just want some fucking *strawberries.* If it makes things worse, I won't remember. At this point I'm okay with that, Dale. #8221; There was a long pause. Then he just quietly said okay and passed her two keyrings, his own on the lanyard and a smaller set with a park keychain on them. It took me a second to place them before I realized they were the keys to the maintenance go-kart. Darius and Mitchell got up to go with her in case there were problems in the bathroom. Then Anne bounced to her feet.  #8220;I can carry the dish. #8221; She gave Leah this somber look.  #8220;If you blank out you might try to eat it but if I have it, I can throw it. #8221; They left, and the rest of us sat in silence.  #8220;Take Me Home, Country Roads #8221; started playing, and everybody swiveled to look at Dale, who just gave us all this *and?* look before getting up to answer his phone outside. Leah and her crew got back before Dale did, and we all waited for her to eat like we were watching an execution. She got through one and a half of her strawberries before she looked up at me with this huge grin.  #8220;I don't feel any different, #8221; she said.  #8220;Except better. I feel better. I don't think I knew how much fruit I ate until this started. #8221; The whole table relaxed. A couple of people actually laughed. Leah went back to her chicken with renewed gusto, splitting her time between it and the strawberries while I laid out some basic rules: always offer the same food at the bathroom before eating, always offer more of it, and make sure nothing offensive was on the plate. She wasn't really listening #8212;she was way too engrossed in her strawberries #8212;so I grabbed my notes to write down what I'd told her, and that was when the day took a turn for the shitty. Dale came back in with his phone in his hand, and after a look at Leah #8212;and a very visible relaxing of his shoulders #8212;he looked back at me and nodded me outside. I raised my eyebrows at hi, and he just jerked his head toward the doors again.  #8220;Everything okay? #8221;  #8220;No. Uh #8212; #8221; I must have looked more scared than I meant to, because he held up his hands.  #8220;In a normal way. Well, not exactly normal. Not a management way. That wedding party at Casablanca? Four servers and a cook were all in the same car and that car got in an argument with a pickup. Everybody's alive but nobody is making service tonight. #8221;  #8220;*Fuck.* #8221;  #8220;Yeah. I've been trying to get hold of some of the other serving crew from King Arthur's, but it's a weekday and school's started. Even the staff from Leroux aren't answering. #8221; I stared at him. Leroux is Leroux Manor, in horror behind the arcade. The staff there isn't bad, but they're a lot more dyed and pierced than you'd expect to see in Casablanca. Dale had to be desperate.  #8220;I know you're not supposed to be picking up shifts for another six weeks, but . . .  #8221; In Dale's defense, I don't think he knows just how well he does puppy eyes. I'm actually not sure he knows he does them at all. He just kind of gives you what he thinks is a  #8220;well, fuck me #8221; look that conveys exactly nothing he thinks it does.  #8220;I'll pick it up. Ask the guys, I think Darius used to be a fine-dining server. I'll have to get my shoes from Leah's. #8221; At least I'd already gotten a pair. Darius wears the same kind of nonslips you'd use in a kitchen when he's in costume, but in Twin Vale we have cowboy boots and that's about it.  #8220;You'll have time. They'll need you by two. #8221; You wouldn't think picking up a shift would be enough to ruin a day, especially a four-hour-long shift, but that's the way things work, sometimes. I got back to Casablanca at a quarter to two with the serious hope there were spare aprons in the back of house, and also a shirt I literally last wore a decade ago, but the uniform hasn't changed, so, you know. Money I didn't have to spend. I went inside and found myself face to face with a scowling kid who threw an apron at me.  #8220;You ready to actually work instead of running around playing pretend? #8221; I just kind of stared at him. The service industry is hard work, no doubt about it, and I think fine dining might be even worse because it tends to come with a certain sense of entitlement. But the job I do doesn't exactly constitute  #8220;not doing work, #8221; especially when it's ninety degrees outside. He made a disgusted noise.  #8220;We all know why you're here. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, I heard, I'm really sorry #8212; #8221;  #8220;I meant because you're screwing Dale. #8221; A few hours later it occurred to me I could have said *jealous?* and really burned his ass by not giving a shit, but at the time I was stuck somewhere between *what?* and *little fast, don't you think?* I ended up going with something really articulate:  #8220;huh? #8221; He opened his mouth, but before he could answer me the actress-looking bartender who served me on the Fourth came out of the back with her hair in a ponytail I definitely wouldn't have expected.  #8220;Stuff it, Josh, he's been working for the park since you were eating paste in middle school. #8221; She tossed a dishtowel at him and stuck out her hand.  #8220;Are you Darius or Nathan? #8221;  #8220;Nathan. Darius is coming? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, Dale said he pulled three of the actors for me. I guess you know what happened this morning. #8221;  #8220;Yeah. Dale told me. #8221; She sighed.  #8220;Of all the fucking days. Nathan, this is Joshua. I'm Alexis. You can call me Alex. Josh, aren't you supposed to be helping with tables? #8221; Josh made a discontented noise and started shuffling off as slowly as he could. Something about it set off something in my brain #8212;a little more than a hunch, but a little less than a certainty.  #8220;How'd he get this job, anyway? #8221;  #8220;Dale's dad has a friend with a kid who needed a college job, #8221; Alex said, just loud enough for Josh to overhear her. His shoulders kind of stiffened and he suddenly remembered how to hustle. I know, I know, but I've said it before: sometimes I'm just a bastard. Alex sighed and shook her head.  #8220;So most of the staff tonight are Casablanca regulars, but you and Darius are coming from the actor side with . . . Maxine? #8221;  #8220;I didn't know she had any serving experience, but she's pretty great. #8221; Alex nodded and gestured me to a table to sit.  #8220;Well, we've got you three and Dale finally managed to get hold of one of the King Arthur sous chefs, so we're only down by one instead of five. I've only got two people on the bar, but it's a limited bar menu, so that shouldn't be a huge problem. #8221;  #8220;I thought you were a bartender. #8221; Alex started laughing.  #8220;Honey, I'm the house manager. I started here as a server six years ago in college after Dale tried to hire me for Caroline's job and upper management said no. They thought I wouldn't be 'dependable enough'. Family, am I right? #8221; I know enough about upper management to bet it wasn't actually Dale's family, but she still wasn't exactly wrong.  #8220;Especially Dale's. #8221;  #8220;I literally worked my way up the ladder just to spite them. And now here we are. Dale said you used to work Casablanca, a really long time ago. #8221;  #8220;Ten years. #8221; Alex whistled through her teeth. Then she looked up and waved. I wasn't too surprised to see Darius already in a Casablanca uniform, but Maxine surprised me a little. She's not the type I'd expect to have a pencil skirt just casually in her closet, much less a pair of pantyhose or black dress flats. Maxine and Darius joined us at the table. Darius apparently worked at Ruth's Chris for two years before starting at the park. Maxine waitressed at Denny's all the way through college, but, as she put it, her entire job these days is working with small children and smiling no matter what, so the snobbery is the only thing she should have to learn. I thought Alex was going to fall off her chair laughing. Casablanca uses tablets for orders now instead of paper pads, and Alex said she'd show us how to use them once they were finished charging and updating #8212;apparently the happy couple chose to go with paper  #8220;movie #8221; tickets for dinner, but drinks could still be rung in via the tablets. Darius and I offered to walk Maxine through the finer points of waiting a formal table while we waited, and then we got table assignments. I was really, *really* hoping I wasn't going to end up with Joshua, but occasionally life likes to kick you when you're down. Service actually didn't go too badly. Joshua fucked off for most of it, which didn't surprise me all that much. Every job you ever work is going to have one of those. It kind of surprises me there's none among the actors, simply because, well, law of averages. I just hooked a tray holder over my arm and carried all eight place settings at one time. At one point I saw him texting back by the cash register and just gave him this giant smile while I walked through with the soup. There's one of those giant security mirrors hanging over the doorway to the hall, and I got to watch him staring after me with this *I may have fucked up* look on his face as I headed out. His loss, because every time I brought drinks to the table somebody wanted to stuff a ten in my pocket. Not for the bartender, either, although I was keeping tabs on what I was getting to split with the bar at the end of the night. It was hard #8212;working an eight-top by yourself on a regular night is hard, forget doing it for a full formal setting #8212;but I was handling it okay. Right up until the thing with Maxine and the spilled brandy. The bride and groom in this party were incredibly sweet, and also apparently interested in food history, because almost the entire menu looked like something that would've been served in the 1940s. Dessert was a pair of flambeed options #8212;cherries jubilee a la mode or peach Melba with crepes. If you've never seen a flambeed dessert, they're made in a sauce that's loaded with some kind of liqueur, and then you bring the whole thing to the tableside and light it on fire. The result usually gets served on top of something else so you don't just have super-sweet fruit. It's pretty cool, as long as you're not the idiot who leans over when you're lighting the thing. The flambe at Casablanca involves just pouring the alcohol right on top of the fruit, and that's where the night went from  #8220;okay with a small amount of crummy #8221; to  #8220;shitty. #8221; Maxine was on her way out of the kitchen, following the server she'd been paired with #8212;one of the long-standing veterans, an older guy named Jose. We only worked a couple of shifts together, but I actually remembered him from my first time at Casablanca, and it wasn't his first season even then. He was carrying the tray with dishes of peaches and cherries on it, and Maxine was behind him with a bottle of brandy. One of the other servers, trying to squeeze past Jose, bumped into Maxine, and the brandy spilled. No real problem. It happens. Except for one thing: In the panic to get everyone in place on short notice, nobody stopped to ask if Maxine's dress flats were nonslip shoes. I wasn't carrying anything, and that was pretty much the only thing to be thankful for when I reached out to grab her. I got her under her armpits, which meant she didn't hit the floor, but I felt it all the way up my back, too. I managed not to yell. That was the other thing to be thankful for. I got Maxine to her feet and shooed her out behind Jose. One of the other servers ran up to me and asked if I was okay. I asked her for some ice and a food-storage bag and tucked the whole thing under my shirt. She gave me a Midol, which was the only thing she had on her, and asked one of the bussers to run out to her car for her spare shoes for Maxine. I grabbed the dessert tray for my table, Joshua still nowhere in sight, and hooked the tray stand over my arm because the one-hand thing looks cool but there was no way I was going to manage it. Luckily, the party was going until 9:30 but dinner service was only until six, and then we just had to help clear the tables. I stopped in the kitchen at one point to lean my back against the freezer door, then headed back out to the table and found Alex waiting to release me. I did a quick once-over, but if anybody was planning to tip for dinner #8212;not usually, at formal services, but sometimes, and I had this feeling this crowd was absolutely a sometimes #8212;they hadn't yet. She gave me this little nod you'll see between servers sometimes if they're trying to be discreet.  #8220;Josh already picked up tips, he should have your half. #8221;  #8220;Well, I'll never see that again. #8221; I shouldn't have said it out loud, but it pissed me off. Alex gave me a concerned look and nodded me back into the kitchen. I didn't play up what he didn't do, but I didn't downplay it, either. Alex went through this whole spectrum from concerned to shocked to angry.  #8220;Why didn't you tell me? #8221;  #8220;My job wasn't to bitch, it was to get things done. #8221; I leaned against the wall and winced, and she gave me this deeply concerned look.  #8220;You okay? #8221;  #8220;I'll be fine. #8221; Which is a lie you tell a lot, when you work in the service industry. Just in case you were wondering. Alex shook her head.  #8220;Go ahead and call it a night. I'll deal with Josh. Stop by tomorrow, okay? #8221; I said I would, but I'm pretty sure I still won't see those tips. It wouldn't bother me if he'd actually done, well, *anything*, but he was taking money I'd earned. Still, even without end-of-service tips, I'd taken in a pretty decent amount. At least one of the couples at my table had been the aunt and uncle of the bride, and they were in a jolly enough mood to make sure I had enough to split with the bar and still walk out with a couple hours' pay just in tips. I headed for the parking lot before texting Leah, and told her I didn't think I could handle the King Arthur staircase. She asked why, and when I told her she replied with *that sucks* and then *I feel your pain. Kind of. I don't know what I did to my hand a couple days ago, but it's been super-stiff. I thought it'd be worked out by now. Hey, if you get some good drugs for your back, bring me some?* I told her I'd be working on a deal for ten thousand OxyContin right away. She sent me a line of laughing emojis. I thought about just driving home, but nixed it in favor of crawling into the back of Dale's pickup. Dale's never bothered with one of those plastic truck liners, so I could lay right on the metal and let the cold soak through my shirt. I figured he'd be at the park until at least eight #8212;I'd have time to let my back calm down and be out before he had to worry about it. That was the plan, anyway. Instead I woke up, with no idea I'd been asleep, listening to the wind scream around the truck. The *moving* truck. Not a situation I'd imagine the creators of Bluetooth ever imagined their product being used for, but when I called Dale picked up. Not at once, like he usually would, but close enough. He probably had to fight his splint to get to the phone buttons. He answered me the same way he'd answer a business call, which was kind of hilarious, actually. I guessed his Bluetooth didn't have caller ID.  #8220;Hey, where are you? #8221;  #8220;Oh, hey! #8221; It was probably the most natural greeting he's given me on the phone since this whole thing started. Which is pretty funny, when you consider we were having the conversation four feet apart at sixty miles an hour.  #8220;Surprised you didn't stop in before you went up to Leah's. What the hell happened at Casablanca? Alex was *livid.* #8221;  #8220;Pull over so I can get in the cab, and I'll tell you. #8221; You know your boyfriend's life is unspeakably weird when he hears something like that, and just . . . does it. As soon as I sat up, I heard him swear through the cab window and felt the truck turn off. He got out and hurried to the bed door to let me out.  #8220;What the *hell,* Nate? #8221;  #8220;It's cold in there. #8221; I could've explained that better, probably, but you try it when your whole back feels like somebody just threw a rock on it. I'll wait. Dale helped me one-handed into the cab. I gave him a rundown of the shift #8212;as best I could, anyway. Midol might be great for period cramps, but it doesn't do *shit* for pulled muscles. Dale swore a couple of times. Then he parked #8212;outside the apartment, not Leah's #8212;and helped me back out.  #8220;I told Dad he was going to be a problem. He wanted to audition for an actor slot and when I told him we weren't hiring any actors this year he was *pissed.* #8221; Dale sighed.  #8220;I'll have to call before Josh can get Daddy Dearest screaming on the phone, if he hasn't already. Alex isn't what you'd call shy about stating her opinions. Maybe I'll finally be allowed to give him a final. #8221; Dale got me a bottle of water and one of whatever the hospital gave him for his wrist, and settled me in bed with an ice pack on my back before going to call his dad. You'd think it'd be a nice end to the day, stretched out in bed with nothing to do tomorrow but research, but all I can think is, there's no way I'm going to be able to sit bent over a book or laptop tomorrow. I guess I'll see if Leah wants to get together, if I can get up the stairs, and see if we can work on unturning her in tandem. At this point I'm pretty sure she won't find it weird if I just lay on the floor to take notes.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Failure [Part 27]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-30 11:10:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gsu34s/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) I failed. Before anybody tries to come down on my side here--which probably won't happen, but the internet is full of weird people--let me make this incredibly clear: I got overconfident, and arrogant, and Leah's lost her life as she knew it because of it. This is my fault. I spent the last three weeks thinking I had this whole thing figured out. The success of the fruit offering seemed clear enough. We started taking fruit and bread to the bathroom daily and it actually seemed like things were reversing #8212;Leah's appetite picked back up, and so did her energy, and one day last week she actually ran all the way out to the parking lot to wave goodbye. She hasn't been past the gates since June. Her hand wasn't healing, but I figured with everything else going on it'd catch up eventually. You know, like an idiot. I assumed there was probably a faster way to help unturn her, but it was working, whatever poison Warin put in her was finally working its way out, and so I slowed down. Took a couple nights off. Had Dale over to the apartment to help me cook enough to refill both Leah's park freezer and her apartment one. Stayed with him a couple nights, too, and things looked so good for Leah, Oliver and Maxine didn't even take the time to be somber before whistling when I walked in wearing one of Dale's jackets. The season's over in a week and I was sure by then Leah would be home, or at least able to leave the park for a few hours every day while the process finished reversing. I'd been right, it never had to be human sacrifices at all, and I was just waiting for the day she came home so I could call Rick and Betty because at least somebody in this family didn't just passively sell her out. Life would start going back to normal, I could help her get back to the normal workaday of being human, Dale and I would be free to regroup and see how we wanted to go forward, the winter park schedule would take over and everything would be okay. And then today I found out I was wrong. I really was looking in the wrong place all along. It was a wild goose chase. And it did waste time until it was too late. I almost had it once, but I got distracted. Because Leah's not a pretender. She was never becoming a pretender at all. It was raining today, which was the absolute pits because October rain is freezing and turns everything into glue and pastes the leaves to the sidewalks so you can't walk without slipping, so almost half of us didn't show for lunch #8212;it was just me, Maxine, Anne, Leah, and Darius, with Madeleine sitting by the piano raptly listening to the Pianist with the Diva and nibbling on some veggies. I've gotten in the habit of bringing her whatever kind of interesting salad stuff I can, because she doesn't *have* to eat any more than I did on the stagecoach, but it's still nice to be able to eat good food. Dale was in horror, checking game calibration in the arcade and making noises about coming to Casablanca for some chili. Caroline texted to ask if one of us could ask the Pianist his question at three because her street was too flooded out for even the Jeep, and at three minutes til Darius dutifully walked up to the piano and waited for his phone clock to turn before asking and returning to the table. It was normal, in other words. Like pretty much any other day, but with fewer people. And then, sometime after the Pianist and before Dale's intended end of day, we were laughing and talking about postseason plans when Leah stopped midsentence. Actually, that's misleading. The sentence kept going. Her voice stopped. She went on for three or four syllables before realizing something was wrong. Then she stopped, eyebrows knit together, and started again. Still silence. She looked up at us with the beginning of alarm on her face, and then we all heard it #8212;a loud, piercing scream, far too high-pitched to be Dale or Gary and far too long to be human. We were all on our feet at once and running out the door, raincoats and umbrellas forgotten behind us. Leah stumbled, and Maxine yanked her to her feet. The screams were coming from Candyland, and I was almost to the gate between it and Hollywood, icy water splashing up my jeans cuffs, when someone crashed into me with enough force to knock me on my ass. I shook my head and looked up just in time to see a blur of colors race across the back plaza and slam into the bathroom door. It was the Sugar Plum Fairy. Only not anymore. Her face was unzipped like a body bag, that giant black and pink beak thrust out of it. Her scalp was peeling back, scattering candy decorations from her hair as it went and showing a pair of dark, multiclustered eyes like spiders' eyes far, far back on either side of the beak. The hands she was beating on the bathroom door looked like cassowary feet instead of a human child's hands, and the green and yellow tutu she'd always worn was vanishing into some kind of thin, coarse bristles with a pied wrinkled skin beneath. This was no Sugar Plum Fairy. This was pure Mulberry, scratching at the metal door hard enough to leave long dents and even, in one spot, a puncture. That was about when Dale came running. I've seen Dale in gym class, and emergencies, and one unpleasantly-memorable night eleven years ago hightailing his ass to get ahead of a tornado touchdown and into the storage space below our building. He's not athletic, but he can hustle when he needs to. The rate he was going across the back plaza with his keys in his hand would've made that other, younger Dale look slow. He got to the bathroom door and shoved Mulberry aside. I had half a second to realize Leah'd slipped again, and then the bathroom was unlocked and she was flinging herself repeatedly into the door of the locked stall.  #8220;Move, will you, I can't #8212;you need a *key,* dammit, #8221; Dale growled, and finally slid his arm under Mulberry's to get the key in the lock. The door swung open. Mulberry flung herself inside, still screaming. The sound faded a lot more rapidly than you might expect from someone simply going down a hole. All of us were breathing hard. Anne was clutching her side. Leah was looking down at her feet, uncomfortably like the day in Twin Vale when it seemed like she'd simply lost all memory. The four of us inside the bathroom were actually steaming as the rain got a taste of the warm indoor air. Darius and Maxine were huddled under the overhang over the door, but neither seemed to be making any attempt to stay dry. The silence was louder and more ringing than any concert I've ever been to. And then Leah looked up. She still looked like Leah . . . mostly. Her eyes were far too green, her skin chalky-pale. Her injured hand looked like the swollen thumb pad had actually grown into a differently-shaped muscle and forced the thumb backward, almost into a claw, and when she raised her other one to push her soaking hair out of her face it looked the same as the injured one. She looked down at her hands, and then at each of us in turn. She wasn't panicked #8212;not yet. Right then, before anyone said anything, she just looked stunned. She opened her mouth like she was going to say something, and I thought her teeth looked different. Longer, maybe. In a horse kind of way, not a vampire kind of way. Then I saw a single drop of spit fall off one of her canines. I didn't actually remember backing into the wall, but in fairness to myself #8212;what I deserve of it, anyway #8212;I got there so fast I'm not sure it took more than a step.  #8220;Oh Jesus Christ. #8221; Leah looked at me, puzzled. Then she blinked, hard, and shook her head, like she'd been blinded, and rubbed the back of her hand across her face. It came away with a thin line of black across the fingers. She looked down at it, and then up at me, and I saw tears forming at the corners of her eyes.  #8220;Leah #8212; #8221; I was going to apologize, I think. I know I reached out for her. But before I could actually get to her she'd bodychecked Darius out of her way and fled into the rain.  #8220;Spread out. #8221; Dale didn't have to say what he meant. I'm pretty sure I've heard people at funerals not sound so grim. We fanned into the back plaza in silence. Maxine and Anne headed back toward Casablanca. Darius nodded toward horror and mumbled something indistinct about Mr. Scratch. Dale and I headed for Candyland. I found his hand and took it, squeezing so hard I thought he might say something, but he didn't #8212;he just squeezed back. A sudden John Denver chorus broke through the silence and the sound of the rain. Dale let go of my hand to pull out his phone.  #8220;Did you find her? #8212;oh. What's up, Gary? No. No. Fuck. Okay. No, let her go. I know where she's going. Take the padlock off the storage cellar, would you? Yeah. Okay. Thanks. #8221; He hung up and just stopped walking, head down, in the middle of the little garden path between Hollywood and Candyland.  #8220;Where is she? #8221;  #8220;Twin Vale. #8221;  #8220;So the padlock is #8212; #8221;  #8220;Iron. #8221; Dale swung the gate open and stepped into Candyland. There are a bunch of tables near the Hollywood entrance that look like giant mushrooms, with caps big enough to mostly protect the tables from the rain. He sat at one and stared at his hands between his knees before pulling out his phone. A few seconds later I got a text alert, from Dale to the four of us in the park: *Can someone go to the cellar by Doc and Kitty's to pick up Leah?* Maxine texted back almost at once, followed by Darius, both already headed that way as soon as Dale's text arrived. The two of us sat in silence broken only by the loud thud of rain on the plastic mushroom cap for what felt like a week, but was actually probably only a minute or two long. I broke it.  #8220;She's not a pretender. #8221;  #8220;No. #8221;  #8220;Did you know? #8221;  #8220;No. #8221; Dale looked like he might shatter like a piece of glass if somebody didn't do something, and finally I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him into a hug. He kind of choked into my shoulder and tangled the fingertips of his splinted hand into my shirt. I put my face against his collarbone and cried. I have no idea how long we might've sat there bawling on each other if Dale's phone hadn't gone off again. Dale lifted his head and picked up, but he didn't try to disguise his voice. I'm pretty sure everyone knew we were breaking anyway. There were a few murmured words and he hung up.  #8220;We need to meet them in horror. #8221; I nodded against his shirt. I didn't want to go, because maybe if I didn't it wouldn't be true, but unfortunately, the real world doesn't work that way. We spotted Maxine and Darius coming down the horror midway as we came in across Hollywood. They were cradling Leah between them like a sleeping kid, Anne holding a huge umbrella over them. Leah was huddled under one of the ponchos Dale and I had used to make a bed for her, once, a million years ago. Darius set her on her feet outside Mr. Scratch's enclosure. She opened it #8212;the lock on his cage, at least, is steel, not iron #8212;and stepped inside before sinking to her knees, sobbing. Anne stepped forward and put a hand on her shoulder. Leah twitched away and crawled a couple of steps forward. Mr. Scratch came out of the bad-weather enclosure and snuffled at her. She wrapped her arms around his neck, and I saw the word  #8220;puppet #8221; silent on her lips before she buried her face in his fur. We all just kind of looked at each other. Darius had tears in his eyes. Maxine didn't, but she was fighting a losing battle with them. Anne was just straight-up crying. Dale looked about as numb as I felt. You don't know helpless until you see somebody you counted a sister crying her heart out and knowing you have absolutely zero way to help her. I finally ducked into the enclosure behind her and wrapped my arms around her. She didn't look up, but she didn't pull away, either. I heard feet behind us, and then Maxine saying  #8220;Madeleine, honey, it's a really bad time. #8221; I'm not proud of what I did next. You don't have to tell me it was a shit thing to do, because I already know, and if I could go back to stop myself I would. But when I heard her name, the first thing I thought of was Warin's voice above me, telling Leah she wasn't salvageable, that she would have been like me except that she'd gone to the underground . . . *your little bunny is a prime example,* he'd said. I ducked out of the cage and grabbed Madeleine's shoulders and gave her a shake. She let out a frightened rabbit squeal. I don't actually remember what order I accused her in #8212;if it was spying on Leah first and conspiring to trap her after, or the other way around #8212;but either way it was an absolute shitshow. Madeleine shook her head so hard her ears flopped. I called her a liar. I've never raised my voice to a kid before in my life. I'm not a big fan of raising a hand to one, either #8212;the closest I've ever gotten before was restraining the kid who kicked my ass in Twin Vale. But I gave her another shake anyway, and then somebody grabbed my upper arm and yanked me away. I looked up and saw Darius giving me this look like I was the world's biggest pile of dogshit, which when I calmed down is about how I felt, but just then I wanted to backhand him. Anne stepped between Madeleine and me.  #8220;What's wrong with you? She's little, she's scared! #8221; I opened my mouth to say something, but suddenly I had no idea what. It hit me: I'd just attacked a kid. Me. The guy who'd wanted to work with little kids since he was ten and had the supposedly bottomless well of patience. I just kind of stared back at everyone. Leah hadn't even noticed. She was still in the enclosure with Mr. Scratch.  #8220;Nathan, go home. #8221; Dale, behind me, voice heavy but stern.  #8220;I #8212;I wasn't #8212; #8221;  #8220;I said go home. #8221; I turned around to look at him, and felt like I was getting a sudden look into what he must have seen all those months ago when I walked into his office and said *this isn't a reunion visit.* I've seen Dale irritated before, but never angry #8212;not at me, at least. I put my head down and took a step toward Mr. Scratch's enclosure to give Leah a hug goodbye. Darius stepped in front of the gate. It hurt, but I wasn't really surprised. This was Leah's fourth season in the park. I'd been there all along, but when it came to being an actual interactive part of the crew, it was my first. And I'd just made a massive scene when she was being destroyed by heartbreak. I just sort of gave this numb nod and stepped past Anne and Madeleine. Madeleine was wrapped in Maxine's arms, but she still shrank away when I got close, and I wanted to shake myself for shaking her. I would've never seen it in myself to get rough with a kid. Sometimes I wonder if the park even has an effect on the actors, not just the sacrifices. I picked up the car keys from Casablanca and headed home. I've sat in the living room most of the day, watching the rain. I don't know if I still have a job; Dale might have counted this as my third strike. For that matter, I might not have a boyfriend. Dale isn't the on-again-off-again type, but he's got a soft spot the size of Texas for Madeleine, and I'm the adult who should know better. But even if I've lost both, I have to take something to Madeleine tomorrow, to apologize. There's absolutely no question I fucked up, and if Leah fades fast from here I don't want one of her last memories of me to be me as the world's biggest asshole. She already has to live with the consequences of my fuckup, I can't saddle her with any more. I'm going to bed now. In the morning I have to text Dale. I hope I can sleep.

    <TITLE>AITA for being annoyed at my coworker for hogging work space?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-31 13:58:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I work in fast food. My coworker is *huge*. I don't mean fat--I mean he's probably four inches taller than me and twice as broad. He's got a little extra weight, but most of it is just. He's massive. I'm honestly a little surprised he doesn't play football (he's in high school). I'm his supervisor.  #8203; *This kid has no concept whatsoever of spacial reckoning.* We work in a galley-style kitchen, and there's just barely enough room for two people to walk past each other. He is *constantly* standing with his body right in the middle of the aisle, meaning you can't go by on either side of him. If I need to get into the warming cabinets behind him I'll have to say "excuse me" two or three times because he doesn't seem to understand that he's blocking the door. (Sometimes after the third or fourth time I'll just open the door into his legs because physical contact seems to be the only way to get through, and then he'll step forward enough for me to get in but won't acknowledge that he was in the way.) A couple of times I've actually gotten blocked into the office because he stops to look at the schedule rather than taking a photo, and doesn't respond to me saying "Excuse me" multiple times. Oftentimes he'll go around corners without looking or slowing down and just crash into whoever's coming the other way. I actually ended up with an injury about six weeks ago when he slammed into me and I almost fell. I don't think he's deliberately bodychecking people--he's just. Not looking. Or not realizing that he's literally twice the size of a couple of people on our staff, and smaller people might bounce off each other but he's a steamroller. I run into people sometimes, but I always apologize and ask if they're okay. When he crashes into someone he'll just kind of let out this soft "oh" and keep meandering on his way. If it's his turn to do the floors at the start of preclose, he'll sweep right over my feet. Then he'll pour water to scrub and get right up to the edges of my feet instead of waiting or moving to another section until I can move. I've told him he needs to pay attention to where other people are because our kitchen is small. He doesn't ignore me, but I'm just not getting through. Everybody else is aware that you have to make yourself small so everybody can get by--work close to the line, be careful at corners, don't block equipment. He's been with us a year and still hasn't figured this out. I haven't actually been like "dude you're fucking huge, get your ass out of the aisle," because that's neither professional nor polite, but I won't lie--I have thought it. It's frustrating when he's on my shifts, because I know it means I'm going to spend my night playing Dodgem with someone who doesn't understand the concept of things, including people, existing in 3-D space. AITA for being annoyed, because size and clumsiness are not choices? Or is it reasonable to expect him to at least try to make it possible for people to pass, put things away, etc.?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Note And Trigger Warning For All Stagecoach Readers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-01 10:19:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys,  #8203; So not to get depressingly real-life on you, but I'm going to get depressingly real-life on you.  #8203; My state has entered a state of emergency due to the George Floyd protests and riots, and because my store is owned by some stupid assholes who care more about their numbers than their people, we are literally basically the only fast food open for a three-mile radius. On top of the insane workload caused by this, I also got to spend today setting up evacuation plans for my crew in the event the store was involved in a riot, and being on high alert for ten hours straight to keep my crew safe.  #8203; I. Am. EXHAUSTED.  #8203; So I'm anticipating not being able to write the next chapter until Tuesday afternoon, because in twelve hours I get to go in and do it all again. Tuesday is my next day off.  #8203; This, however, kind of works out, because I work Wednesdays but I'm off Thursday and Friday--meaning the timing works out perfectly for me to do a two-part finale.  #8203; Yes, we're at the last three chapters.  #8203; Which brings me to the second part of this: the trigger warning bit. Stagecoach has taken some dark turns before, and if you're still here after all of canon you're probably pretty sturdy, but in the next three chapters you can expect:  #8203; \--major character death \--minor character death \--suicidal ideation \--suicide-like situations \--language that was very progressive in 1962 and is now just downright offensive \--more extreme body horror (yes, worse than Mulberry) \--Nathan just straight-up pulling a gun on somebody else in the main cast  #8203; And now, having said all that: I feel like I have to assure you that Nathan and Leah survive, and this is not a Hunger Games-style ending where Everything Is Horrible Just Because. (I love THG, but I fuckin' *hate* endings like that.) Mostly I feel the warning is necessary because I don't know about anybody else's mental health on this sub, but unexpected character death fucks me *up.*  #8203; Hope to see you all on Friday . . . .  #8203; \--Nina</TEXT>

I hope I manage to elicit the same level of anguish from you at least once :D  #8203; Agreed. We had some folks in last night who I'm pretty sure were on their way to protests and/or riots after leaving our store. They were clearly angry, but not at us, and there was this deep feeling of unease and tension while they were there. I get the anger 100%, but I really hope they understand we're being forced to work.  #8203; ("Hey Aunt Nina, can you tell me about 2020 for my school project?" "Yes. I worked.")</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\[Warning: this is *not* a MacCready-friendly post. Please do not try to change my mind.\]  #8203; So on my first playthrough, I got all possible non-faction companions (except Preston, obvs, because I was following directions straight to the MM).  #8203; I promptly fell *deeply* in loathing with MacCready. He struck me as selfish, hypocritical, whiny, lazy, and at best incredibly neglectful of his son. (Who's watching Duncan while MacCready is up in the Commonwealth "drinking himself blind" in his own words and playing around with the Gunners? Why didn't he bring Duncan with him?) I was dismayed when I found out all companions are essential and I thus couldn't just murder him after getting his perk, because seriously, fuck MacCready. (And hopefully whoever has Duncan down in the Capital Wasteland is doing a way better job than his deadbeat dad.)  #8203; So this is my first *full* playthrough since then (not counting all the times I've gotten wildly bogged down in sidequests and never finished). I just took him through Med-Tek, I was deeply looking forward to turning off his essential status and nuking his ass from orbit . . . . and then Daisy said "take care of MacCready, he's one of the good ones."  #8203; I have absolutely *zero* idea on what basis she feels this way, because I have yet to see anything admirable or honorable in MacCready, but I absolutely adore Daisy.  #8203; I know she'd never actually know if I killed him and dumped his body way down in the swamps (or perhaps even better, the Glowing Sea). But I do dislike the idea of letting her down.  #8203; Should I go ahead with my months-awaited murder? Or suck it up?</TEXT>

Either they jackknife into action or they are bad people. Also, if they are doing offline activism, they MUST keep everyone informed about it, even if doing so could be detrimental to the cause. (Let's be real: he posted information for a protest in Dublin, and it seemed likely he was going to it. If he'd said "I'm going to this" do you think it would have remained a protest or would it have been a bunch of fangirls screaming to meet him?) Fuck's sake. He posted on his IG during the time you're so butthurt about and gathered information. Not having a kneejerk response, taking a day or two to process, is *not a bad thing.* I'm not crying over him.

    <TEXT>He would be uninformed because *shit was happening very rapidly here.* I hate that I even have to say this, because this should not be a possible sentence in any kind of sane world, but there were no riots after a good two or three dozen high-profile Black deaths in the last few years. The fact that we hit this tipping point is necessary, but *wild.* It is *entirely* possible that by the time he got online, things had gone from "oh shit, another Black murder" to " . . . . and Minneapolis is burning, that's happening, oh, and they're shooting protestors. That's great. This is fine." It would literally have only taken a few hours for that to happen, and he may not have wanted to speak up until he had some idea what the fuck was going on because *none of us did.* Yelling RACISM IS BAD fifteen minutes after something happens sounds nice, but it has no real substance. We have no idea on what timeline he would have said something without fan pressure. But I can tell you from previous actions that *he does act without fans requesting it.* Sometimes it takes him a little while. About two days after the Squirrel Hill synagogue shooting he posted some links on how to donate to the Jewish community, and frankly, that was a hell of a lot more than most celebs were doing for us. We don't know why he didn't post sooner, we don't know what's going on in his personal life or what's going on in his head. But bitching about how he wasn't fast enough for you *one time* does absolutely nothing. Bitching about it *repeatedly* when he has, what, a consistent five-year track record of speaking up loudly and often, just makes you look petty. And yes, things are building and intensifying. But they're not doing so on the backs of celebrities. Pretending they are is disingenuous at best.</TEXT>

Many people have added brahmin milk, a few have added salt, and one has added honey (when I actually get this titan off the ground I want to ask that person if I can make their beehive mod a prerequisite for my mod because it's *beautifully* done and why reinvent the wheel), but NOBODY has added maple sugar. You can even tap trees in Far Harbor! . . . . but all you can do with it is make Ware's Brew. Where is the maple syrup? Maple sugar used to make further goodies like mutfruit pies?

And I am *damned* well aware that if shooing them onto the roof or out the back door is what it comes to, my body will be between innocent workers and cops, not innocent workers and Those Angry Oversensitive Black People The Media Wants To Pretend Exist, and that it will be police I'm lying to about where my crew went, and that it is police who may well beat or kill me for it. I've been trying to make peace with myself about that. I've long known I might die doing this job (armed robbery is common in my part of town, and so is meth), but this is the first time it's felt close enough to touch. I am *very* aware of what the police and stupid fucking . . . white thrillseeking moronic jackasses are doing. "Fifteen minutes" as in "how other people were doing it." You know. The way you seem to feel entitled to him doing it. Plenty of people immediately started screeching the RACISM IS WRONG line. Also, like, in case you didn't notice, he did post the day after George Floyd's death, specifically in response to it. So it was two days he didn't engage. He noted the situation, offered his support, and *shut the fuck up.* Having to lie about what he did and didn't do in order to get mad is not a good look. I will repeat: we do not know what he was doing for those three days. It's entirely possible he saw the news and went " . . . nope, can't handle any more, if I post right now it's going to be something we will ALL regret later" and waited until cooler heads prevailed. Or that he was told by his label to wait because they were planning actions. Or that he simply felt he had nothing to add to the conversation, and shut up. And if that's not what you said, then maybe you need to reconsider your words, because it is damn well what it sounds like. The fact that pretty much everyone on this sub is getting that message from you suggests whatever you're trying to get across isn't clear.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Getting Informed [Part 28]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-04 14:17:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 27](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gtclm6/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) I didn't actually get to see Madeleine or Leah yesterday. I stopped by the park around ten in the morning, but as soon as I saw Dale's truck I just kind of turned around and pulled back out. I just got the  #8220;you're not welcome #8221; vibe and decided it might be better if I tried again later. I headed to the library, but Margie #8212;she's the main librarian #8212;just kind of shook her head at me before I even got past circulation.  #8220;Nothing new, honey, #8221; she said.  #8220;I've still got that Tuath D #233; book on ILL for you, but it hasn't come in yet. #8221; You know you spend too much time at the library when you manage to read through two whole sections in six months and then get started on interlibrary loan. I thought I might at least try to make something for an early supper and settle in with my notes, but I literally managed to burn a grilled cheese sandwich. They're easy to burn if you set the heat too high, but grilled cheese is literally the only food I was allowed to make by myself before leaving home and I had it down to a science by the time I was twelve. That was about the sixth time I texted Dale. He'd left me on read a few times, and I was trying not to dwell on it, but finally I couldn't help it: *curious minds want to know, am I just having a shit day or experiencing retaliation?* He answered, but all he said was *idk,* which wasn't exactly helpful. And then I slept like shit and woke up with a crick in my neck. Which was fine, because I wanted to get to the park before anyone else did. I let myself in the employee entrance with Leah's key around eight in the morning and headed straight for Casablanca. Mulberry's original trailer was still on the grounds, and Madeleine had nominally accepted it, but in practice she actually slept in Casablanca most nights. I found Maxine's purse and keys on our usual table alongside a plate that looked like it might be some homemade bread. Madeleine was still sleeping on the piano, so I just sat quietly until she woke up and immediately padded off to the bathroom. She came back with water all over her whiskers, so I was pretty sure she went to wash. She saw me and squeaked.  #8220;Hey. #8221; I tried to be gentle greeting her, but she was still looking at me with her ears and whiskers down. You have no idea how expressive rabbit faces are until you see a giant one on a little kid.  #8220;Hey, can we talk for a minute? #8221; Madeleine nodded, but she headed for me like she thought I was about to make soup with her. I squatted down so we were face to face.  #8220;Listen, I did something *really* shitty the other day. #8221; I try not to swear in front of kids, but I couldn't think of a better description #8212;mean isn't really it and *I was a jerk* really undersells it.  #8220;I got mad and scared and decided it was your fault when it didn't have anything to do with you, just because of what you look like. And like #8212;if there's anybody who should know *exactly* how shitty that is, it's me. I could've really hurt you, for something that wasn't your fault. And even if it was your fault, hurting you wouldn't fix it. #8221; Madeleine kind of nodded and shrugged. Then she held her hands up and wiggled her fingers. She's lighter than me or Maxine, but you can still tell her head is the only white thing about her.  #8220;Even before those assholes dragged you underground, huh? #8221; She nodded. Her whiskers weren't drooping anymore. I decided to take that as hopeful.  #8220;So #8212;I don't actually know if I'm welcome here anymore. I might've gotten myself kicked out, and I understand if I did. But at the very least I wanted to tell you I'm sorry. You didn't deserve it, it didn't solve anything, and it didn't make anybody happier. Actually I think it kind of made all of us more miserable. So . . . I apologize, for yelling and shaking you. #8221; Madeleine kind of put her head on the side. Then she took a couple of very slow steps forward and put her arms around my neck, almost like she was waiting to see if I was going to bite. I hugged her back, and when I did she buried her face in my neck and squeezed me as hard as she could #8212;which is a lot harder than most kids her age, but still not exactly terrifying. Eventually I started swaying.  #8220;Listen, if you want to keep hugging me that's fine, but I have to sit down. #8221; Madeline leaned. I fell, first from the squat onto my ass and then straight onto my back. She let out a shrill little-kid giggle and one of her ears flopped into my face. I just stared up at the ceiling.  #8220;Okay. You know what, okay, that's fair. #8221; Her giggles intensified. And that was about when I heard the door, so the first thing Maxine saw was me on the floor and Madeleine pinning me with no apparent intention of stopping laughing anytime soon.  #8220;*What* is going on in here? #8221;  #8220;Send help. I've been kidnapped and subdued by really cute fairies. #8221; Madeleine's giggling got so much harder I swear the kid started vibrating. I finally pushed her off me #8212;gently, though, the way you do when you have a small kid on you and can't breathe. She fell on her butt, still giggling. There were a few clumsy thudding sounds from Maxine's direction, and then I looked up and saw Leah standing behind her. She was barefoot, probably because her shoes wouldn't fit over where her feet used to be. They were still foot-colored, but narrow, and long, and her toes looked almost like they'd fused together. She was in her favorite yoga pants, though, and a tee-shirt, and it looked like Maxine had washed and braided her hair. I let out a breath I didn't even know I was holding. Seriously, the worst part of the whole stuck-in-the-park deal is personal hygiene. Seeing Leah washed and turned out was a relief. She saw me and clamped her lips shut over her teeth. I pulled myself to my feet and crossed the room to hug her, not letting myself hesitate. If I did, she'd see #8212;and I couldn't let her. Leah stayed stiff as a board when I hugged her. I let go of her shoulders with one arm so I could grab what used to be her hand, and she finally relaxed a little.  #8220;Are your feet cold? #8221; She nodded against my shoulder.  #8220;Want me to see if I can pick up some moccasins or something? #8221; There was a pause so long I almost wondered if time stopped. Then she nodded again.  #8220;I'll take a look in town after I go. Even if there's nothing that'll fit you there's got to be a place selling leather and we can make you some foot wraps. Or ask Charlie. I'm pretty sure she'll still be in Twin Vale on Halloween. #8221; Charlie is the leathersmith, and she was Dale's first hire, although he wasn't in charge of the park at the time #8212;he was sixteen, and found her at a local street fair selling her work, and he picked up a leather bicycle seat and then pestered Rick until he offered her a job. Rick wasn't a fan of hiring a butch lesbian leatherworker because he thought she'd show up dressed like the Folsom Street Fair or something, but Dale sweet-talked him into it, and now she's the longest-lived employee in the whole park. And if anybody could figure out how to make a pair of shoes to fit Leah's new feet, it's Charlie. The three of us sat down to warm up #8212;it wasn't raining today, but October in Ohio is October in Ohio no matter what you do #8212;and I jumped before grabbing the paper grocery bag I'd left by my chair.  #8220;Hey Mads, this is yours. #8221; Madeleine looked startled. I ran back over what I'd said.  #8220;Sorry. Madeleine. #8221; She shook her head so hard her ears almost hit her in the face. Then she grabbed my leg.  #8220;You like Mads? #8221; She nodded.  #8220;Okay. This is yours. #8221; I pushed the bag toward her. There wasn't much in it, but I had the feeling if I tried to hand it to her she'd topple over. She peeped into it, then let out one of those high rabbit squeals. Maxine shot upright and stared at me like she was going to grab the first convenient object and bash me with it, and then Madeleine fell over trying to pull the stuffed tiger out of the bag. It wasn't that big, but it was big enough for one of the paws to get caught on the edge. I grabbed the bottom of the bag so she could pull it out properly and watched her bury her face in it. Maxine sat back. I was going to offer Madeleine the bag back so I could tell her there was something else in it, but before I could Caroline burst in with Anne and slapped a bag of her own down on the table.  #8220;Guess what I found. #8221; I shrugged. Maxine raised her eyebrows. Leah just looked vaguely depressed. Caroline dumped the bag and put one of those little grocery store arranged single-serve fruit and cheese platters in front of Leah before slapping a pack of cocktail swords down next to it.  #8220;I found out you can hold these things like cigarettes and still use them to eat off of. Go on, go on, I already left another one at the bathroom. #8221; She flopped into a chair.  #8220;Oh, hi Nathan. #8221; I forgot she wasn't there when I lost my shit, but Anne apparently hadn't.  #8220;Have you talked to Dale? #8221; I waited for Leah to dig into her fruit before I answered.  #8220;He's not responding to my texts. #8221; Anne winced. She might still be pissed at me, but that one hit her hard.  #8220;He should be in soon, if you want to talk to him . . .  #8221;  #8220;I want to talk to him. I don't think he wants to talk to me. Hey Mads, you're missing something. Look in the bag again. #8221; Madeline all but crawled into the bag to reach the bottom, then let out an excited scream.  #8220;Well, someone sounds happy. #8221; Dale's voice. If Madeleine noticed I reacted, she didn't show it. She just ran up to him with the other half of my apology gift in her hands and shoved it in his face. Dale shook his head a little and pulled the case back so he could see it.  #8220;Looney Tunes, huh? I haven't seen these since I was a kid. #8221; Madeleine danced around him and pushed him toward the kitchen, which was kind of funny, actually, because she's so little and he's so huge it was a little like watching her push on a rock. He looked down at her.  #8220;You good? #8221; Somehow she managed to convey wanting to watch cartoons on the big screen in the old theatre. Dale made some grumpy bellyaching noises about not having a setup for it until Maxine pointed out Leah had a DVD projector and Caroline suggested us being in the theatre would make things easier for the Casablanca staff, decorating for the big Halloween shindig in a couple days. Dale rolled his eyes and shooed them off to get Leah's projector, Caroline taking the DVDs so Madeleine could cart her tiger. I didn't look at Dale until we were alone.  #8220;Are we fighting? Because I feel like if we're fighting it'd help a lot if you could specify what it is we're fighting about. #8221; Dale gave me this look: *are you fucking kidding me?*  #8220;I don't appreciate the sarcasm. #8221;  #8220;I'm being serious. Is this only about Madeleine? Because okay, fine, be mad at me, I was an absolute asshole, but it'd be helpful to know if there's something else I should be worried about. #8221; Dale stared out the doors. Casablanca is fronted entirely in glass, and some days it's gorgeous, but others #8212;like today #8212;it's just kind of gray and depressing.  #8220;I'm not convinced you ever actually turned all the way back, Nate. #8221; He turned to look at me again.  #8220;The Nathan who got on that stagecoach would take one look at the Nathan I saw two days ago and fail incredibly at beating the shit out of him, but he'd try. #8221;  #8220;The Nathan who got on that stagecoach was just starting to believe he wasn't going to be abandoned every time he wasn't perfect. That changes you, you know, just a little. No fairy potions needed. #8221; Dale hid his wince pretty well. Not great, but pretty well.  #8220;You know what I mean. #8221;  #8220;So do you. #8221; Dale ran a hand through his hair and sighed.  #8220;We could sit here and go in circles about this all damned day, couldn't we? #8221; He flopped into a chair.  #8220;No. It isn't just Madeleine. I'm pissed about Madeleine, but I'm worried about you, too. If I thought for a single second you'd actually accept it I'd find a way to drag you as far from the park as I could and keep you there. #8221;  #8220;Why? #8221; Dale looked bleak.  #8220;Because fae adopt humans they like, Nate, and Leah adores the shit out of you, and I don't have anyone to go to bat for you this time. #8221; There was a small squeak behind us. We both swiveled, and spotted Leah standing near the doors.  #8220;Leah #8212; #8221; I have no idea what I actually meant to say to her, but it didn't really matter #8212;she crossed the room, inhuman speed making up for clumsy inhuman feet, and scrabbled at my legal pad with the pads of her fingers until she found a blank page before grabbing my pen in a clumsy fist. I grabbed at it, but she yanked away and scribbled a series of children's letters across the pad. *SAFE,* it said. Then she looked at it, shifted the pad frantically with her elbow and wrote *BOTH* above it. Dale looked bleak.  #8220;I want like hell to believe you, Leah. But we don't know what happens from here. I . . .  #8221; He ran his hand through his hair again.  #8220;Fuck it. I'm scared shitless. I want to help you, I don't know if I can. I want to protect Nate, I know I can't. I don't want to lose you, but I might. None of us know if you . . . if *you* will be here tomorrow. #8221; I wanted to yell at him, tell him to stop frightening her, but the truth is, none of it is new to her. She knew it all already. Her lip wobbled, and I thought she might actually break down completely into tears. Then she got this *look* I don't know how to describe, but I wouldn't want to be the person trying to fight Leah with that look. She scrabbled the pen into her claw again. *Nobody touch,* she wrote, and then, under it: ***I PROMISE.*** Underlined. She dropped the pen, and I saw a drop of blood run down her wrist where what used to be her thumbnail was dug in while she wrote. She just looked at both of us, solemn as a church. I didn't wait for Dale to come up with a response. I just stood up and pulled her into the tightest hug I could and kissed her cheek. She hugged back, but with her arms, not what used to be her hands. I wondered in a morbid kind of way if it was because they hurt her, or because she was afraid of hurting me. She let go, leaned toward me, pulled back, stopped. Then she grabbed her shirt collar, using the heels of her hands to push it against her chest so she could slip her claws under it, and pulled it over her face. And only when she was satisfied her mouth was totally covered did she kiss me back. If I wanted to cry when I saw her crawl into Scratch's cage, it was nothing to how I felt feeling her lips through a well-loved cotton-blend collar. I heard a noise that wasn't me and wasn't her #8212;Dale, trying not to bawl. I don't know if Leah reminds him of Deanna, but she reminds me of my sister, and honestly that just makes the idea of losing her worse. Dale reached out and took her claw and squeezed. Gently, though, like he was afraid of breaking whatever strange new bones were under the surface. Leah promptly got dragged into a game of Miss Mary Mack as soon as the three of us got into the theatre. Dale looked around with the kind of  #8220;I'm not impressed, but I'm impressed #8221; look you get when something is way bigger than you, but also totally familiar. He took Leah's projector rig #8212;actually made to show on the far wall of the living room, but good enough #8212;and tucked it in his shirt before hoisting himself up the ladder. I decided to follow, because I have a death wish, I guess. Dale pulled the reel off the ancient projector and set Leah's more modern tiny little thing up on the window ledge of the projection booth.  #8220;We don't need that shit playing in here today. #8221;  #8220;What *is* it, anyway? Oliver was scared shitless of it. Said it was like watching a creepypasta. #8221; Dale shrugged.  #8220;That's about it. You can probably take a pretty good guess what happened in here, back in the sixties. #8221;  #8220;This is where Grace and Robert were turned. #8221; Dale nodded as he hunted for a plug.  #8220;Robert stopped to fight and Grace came up here to hide. No idea why she didn't just run out the back door. #8221;  #8220;It was labeled as a Jim Crow exit on a couple of those old blueprints. Might've already been locked for the night. You know, can't have the Negroes sneaking back in here to stare at a blank screen. #8221; Dale snorted and shook his head.  #8220;Gross. But it sounds logical enough. *Here's* the fucker. #8221; He plugged in the projector.  #8220;The reel in the old projector . . . it's what happened to them. But sped up. Motion-lapse, I guess you could call it. Movie editing as taught by the Wild Ones. #8221;  #8220;Have you seen it? #8221;  #8220;Once, and that was enough. More than. #8221; He pushed a button, and I heard the fan whirr on.  #8220;If I'd known you two were going to go fucking around back here, I would've made you take me with you. I'm not entirely sure what lives here now. I don't think it's actually the Wild Ones. More like something that hangs out with them. The way you'd expect to find stray animals living in a vacant lot or wildflower fields near a beehive. Brownies or something, maybe. But it's not something you should play with. #8221; I thought he might leave the booth once the DVD was playing. Each disk was a couple of hours long. But instead he grabbed one of the stools sitting in the corner and put his feet up on the ledge, well away from the projector. I decided to join him. I didn't put my feet up, though. I couldn't actually reach. Apparently there's a warning now on Looney Tunes DVDs about them coming out in the forties and being full of stuff that isn't acceptable anymore. Which is kind of cool, I guess. I would've rather had the ones I grew up on, whether they were edited or not, but at least they owned it. After awhile I grabbed my legal pad and started going back over notes. At this point, with all the stuff I have taped to the pages, I'm surprised it didn't fall apart when Leah grabbed it. Dale glanced over at it and frowned.  #8220;Why do you have a picture of my Aunt Eileen? #8221; It was the crossed-out girl. Who I'd never heard of.  #8220;Who? #8221;  #8220;Aunt Eileen. My great-aunt, technically, I guess. She was the first female park manager. Right after Robert. #8221;  #8220;She looks like Leah. #8221; Dale peered at the photo.  #8220;From that angle, I guess. Where'd you even find that? Nobody talks about it anymore. #8221;  #8220;A certain photo enthusiast's collection. #8221; I pulled it off the page.  #8220;Any idea why she's crossed out? #8221; Dale shrugged.  #8220;She was murdered, #8221; he said, and it sounded weirdly casual until I realized he was probably talking about a woman a couple of generations previous who he'd never met.  #8220;1969. Told her husband no kids and three days later they found her body under the Lemon Squeezer and her head a little farther afield. Roller-coaster in Hollywood, #8221; he explained.  #8220;Her sister #8212;my grandmother #8212;took over the park and the first thing she did was tear it out. #8221;  #8220;What the hell *happened?* #8221;  #8220;The official story is, a ride test went horribly wrong. Family gossip points out her husband wasn't seen again, either. #8221;  #8220;Do you think W #8212;a certain somebody decided to deal with him? Because I get the feeling she was marked down to be a pretender. #8221;  #8220;I know he did. Ah, shit! #8221; Dale grabbed the projector remote and flipped to the next short. Somewhere below us, Madeleine protested. Dale ignored it.  #8220;Sorry. #8221; I shrugged.  #8220;I wasn't even paying attention. More family gossip? #8221; Dale kind of gave me this sympathetic *you're an idiot, but I love you* look.  #8220;I'm guessing you didn't look around too hard the first time you were up here. #8221; I stared at him. Then I swiveled around on the stool to stare at the pile of blackish stuff I'd stuck my hand in a few months ago, and then back to Dale. He just shrugged at me.  #8220;It won't come up if you try to clean it. Just if you're wondering. #8221;  #8220;You know, you say shit like that like it's totally normal and it kind of makes me wonder how *anybody* in your family gets married. #8221;  #8220;You don't get to know all the really cryptic shit until you're in the manager's chair. Like you only get to find out about the aliens in Area 51 after you become President. Eventually . . .  #8221; He shrugged.  #8220;You just get used to it. #8221;  #8220;I think I must not've been using English the first time, let me try this again. You say shit like that like it's totally normal #8212; #8221; Dale started laughing, and I think that's when we got okay again, but something pinged me about what he said #8212;that way where you know you're about to realize something important, but it runs off before you can get it. I did have an idea, though. Or part of one, when he said *you only find out after.* Halloween is in two days. It used to be Warin's day. Now it's Madeleine's. And pretty much every pagan and Western folkloric text I can find goes on and on about how important it is. I'm pretty sure, if there's hope left, if there's something I can do . . . . . . . I've got about 48 hours to figure it out. [Part 29, Section One](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gx78wl/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on the immediate resources and medical knowledge of those around you, which does \*not\* have to be extensive.  #8203; Like, this would be a DEEPLY crude way of doing it, but: tourniquet to stem immediate bleeding. Machete. Hot fire. Lots of liquor down your gullet while the machete heats up to white-hot, and then bam, bam, cauterized and let's stimpak that fucker up. (If a stimpak can heal a broken bone in moments--and in-game dialogue confirms that is what happens--then I maintain it can heal whatever didn't cauterize properly.) Take antibiotics and herbal microbial to prevent infection. Wash daily with clean water. It'd heal ugly, but it would heal. Hell, you could actually do it on your own, if you could work up the guts (and frankly "if you don't you will die" is a very fast way to do that).  #8203; Far more dangerous than the wound itself would be the possibility of infection, especially because nobody in the Commonwealth seems to have realized what soap is for.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Murderer [Part 29, section one]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-05 15:58:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 28](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gwia5n/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/) [[OOC WARNING: the link embedded in the story below contains strobing lights.]]  #8203; Well. I won. If you can call that winning. It only cost me everything. Today didn't start off like the end of the world. I woke up in Leah's shed, which is actually the hay shed near Scratch's enclosure. She couldn't climb the castle stairs anymore, and after the first night #8212;when nobody could find her anywhere #8212;Gary reported a small nest in the shed, old horror costume pieces thrown together in the hay to make a bed. Everybody else promptly descended with her blankets and some books, because she can still turn pages, and Anne brought her a space heater and a table to keep it on so it didn't catch the hay on fire. I stayed last night to keep her company. She's right, sleeping in a hay bale is pretty comfy, as long as you keep a blanket down to avoid the straw scratch. Dale was there when I woke up, watching me. There are a whole lot of ways you can watch somebody sleep, and most of them are pretty creepy, but when I sat up and rubbed my eyes he just kind of gave me this crooked smile like he'd been there awhile but decided Leah and I could both use the rest. He nodded me out of the shed with a finger on his lips #8212;not that he needed to tell me, I know a lot better than most people how much of an escape sleep can be #8212;and as I crossed the threshold it hit me, all at once. *We who now claim ownership. You don't get to know #8212;until. If the new contract lets me.* At eight this morning, I thought I was a fucking genius.  #8220;I know how I'm going to solve this. All of it. Leah. Your family. Everything. #8221; Dale just kind of gave me this look like I'd suddenly taken a three-mile jump and left him behind. I waved a hand at him.  #8220;I have to talk to Madeleine. I might get on shift late. #8221; And I pecked his cheek and zipped off before he could ask questions, because I think I've pointed out before that running on instinct is how things usually turn out best for me. Except this time, I guess. I found Madeleine in Casablanca #8212;little surprise there, I guess #8212;with this little thing that kind of looked like a tablet but apparently was actually a DVD player, ears-deep in Looney Tunes.  #8220;Morning, Mads. I need to ask you a question and it's important. #8221; She put down her DVD player and tilted her head at me.  #8220;You're in charge of the park, right? Like #8212;from the Wild Ones side. #8221; She nodded.  #8220;But you're not the one in charge of the Wild Ones. #8221; A shake of the head this time.  #8220;So if I needed to talk to someone about the contract, it wouldn't be you. #8221; Another head shake.  #8220;Do you know who it would be? #8221; Nod. I took a deep breath. The question itself was simple. It was everything that went with it that was big.  #8220;Do you know how I can talk to them? #8221; She looked horrified.  #8220;Mads, please. It's important. #8221; She pinned her DVD player to her chest and shook her head, hard. I sighed. I'd have to ask Dale, and I didn't want to bring him into it, but that was the choice I had left.  #8220;Okay. #8221; I got up and scratched between her ears.  #8220;Have fun today, okay? Last day of the season. #8221; I headed back to horror. Leah was getting up, rubbing at her eyes with the backs of her claws.  #8220;Hey, sleeping beauty, want some help with that bird's nest? #8221; She bared her teeth at me. It was weird and, honestly, kind of terrifying, the first time I saw it, but even though it'd only been a couple days it didn't take me long to figure out it was about what she could do now for making a horrible face at someone.  #8220;Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, everybody loves me 'cause I'm cute and not for my charming personality. Cold world. Turn around. #8221; I sat down while she got herself turned around. I was halfway through brushing out the knots when Dale reappeared in the doorway. I swapped him spots in the chair and he started sectioning out her hair. Leah twisted around to look at him.  #8220;Yeah, I can't do anything from this angle, you have to sit still. #8221; She kept staring at him. He made a turning motion with his finger and started a braid up near her hairline, tucking pieces as he went.  #8220;I used to have a little sister, #8221; he told her, finally.  #8220;Deanna. She was halfway between me and Dean. She was a cheerleader. I learned how to braid her hair because it's safer than ponytails. #8221; He tucked up the pieces right behind her ears.  #8220;If it's flat against your head it's less likely to get caught on something. #8221; Leah raised both her hands in a shrugging motion. Dale grabbed a couple of her bobby pins out of the little tray on top of the space heater and stuck them in the corner of his mouth.  #8220;She died a few months before I took over the park, #8221; he said.  #8220;Her boyfriend said she swerved to avoid a deer and hit a pothole. #8221; He paused long enough to tuck the bobby pins in and find a hair elastic.  #8220;She was sixteen. #8221; Leah twisted around again. The braid whipped out of Dale's hands, but at least the elastic was mostly on. She stared up at him, then wrapped her arms around his legs and laid her cheek on his knees. Dale sighed and leaned over to finish securing the elastic.  #8220;Yeah, it fucking sucks, #8221; he said.  #8220;I still miss her. She's not stuck running this hellhole, though, and that's something. Do you want to get in costume now or later? #8221; Leah held up her wrist and tapped it. Dale looked at his phone.  #8220;Just after nine. #8221; Leah made a kind of waving gesture like she was throwing something. *Later.* Dale hoisted himself out of the chair.  #8220;I'll see if one of the girls can help you around ten-thirty, then, #8221; he said.  #8220;Casablanca's a no-go this morning, but there's going to be a brunch bar in King Arthur's if you're hungry. #8221; Leah grinned. Then she stuck out her feet. I grabbed the really piss-poor excuse for moccasins I'd managed to cobble together so I could slip them on her feet. They're basically just tubes of black leather with a zipper sewn into the top to make the only seam, but they keep her feet covered. I'd been planning to ask Charlie for something better, but if I could get Dale to work with me, I could do even better than that. I zipped her into her moccasins, and she pushed herself to her feet before pushing her tee-shirt over her face and kissing me and Dale and speeding off toward Candyland. Dale glanced at me. I thought he was going to say something about Leah, but he didn't.  #8220;I'm supposed to tell you that what you're thinking about, whatever the hell it is, is incredibly dangerous and you shouldn't do it for any reason whatsoever, but if you still want to see upper management, Madeleine will take you. There's a bend in the underground tunnel where they can speak but you won't turn. #8221;  #8220;I don't 'want' to see them, but I have to. Sort of like changing diapers. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, I had the feeling you'd say that. #8221; He took a chain off from around his neck and scooped the pendant into his hand.  #8220;I'm going to send you with this, then. If you'll take it. #8221; He tipped the whole thing into my hand. It wasn't a pendant at all #8212;it was a pair of silver rings.  #8220;What are these? #8221;  #8220;There used to be one hell of a question attached to these. I wouldn't ask it right now and if that changes in the future I'd get a different pair. But they're sterling. I've worn them every Halloween in the park since I bought them. You shouldn't carry iron or laurel to a meeting with the Old Ones, but silver is fine. It'll protect you. #8221; I pulled both of them off the chain. He was right #8212;I could just see a little  #8220;.925 #8221; inside the bigger band. I put it onto my thumb, let it dangle for a second, and then slid it onto his finger. He stared at me.  #8220;Yes, I'll give you the chance to prove you deserve to ask it someday. #8221; He gave me this incredibly tired, but contented smile. I don't think I've seen that expression since before I landed on the stagecoach.  #8220;That's a hell of a lot more than I thought I'd get six months ago. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, well, at some point this guy I know told me he was done not standing up for himself and it was kind of attractive. #8221; Dale started laughing. Then he hugged me and put the smaller ring on my finger. If I'd known then what I know now, I might not have let him.  #8220;Be as careful as you can be, #8221; he said.  #8220;And don't forget. You need to look for every single loophole in anything either of you say and close every one as tight as you can. #8221;  #8220;I will. #8221; He held my face between his hands for a minute, like he was studying it to be sure he wouldn't forget it. Then he kissed me.  #8220;Christ, Nate, be careful, #8221; he whispered. I leaned against him.  #8220;I'll do my best. #8221; I took some provisions with me into the underground. Nothing I read all summer told me anything about going into the fae realm #8212;except, you know,  #8220;don't do that #8221; #8212;but given how hard some of these old entities leaned into a specific set of hospitality rules, it seemed like it might be a good idea to take some stuff with me. Madeleine met me at the Hollywood bathroom, drooping all over. I got to one knee and gave her a hug. Then I kissed her cheek.  #8220;It's going to be okay, kiddo. Really. #8221; Then I made a face and pulled a white piece of fur off my lips.  #8220;Ugh. Kid, we need to get you a hairbrush. #8221; Madeleine still looked scared, but she giggled anyway. Then she pulled the door open with both hands, and unlocked the far stall. I stared at what was in the bottom of it. The floor didn't extend past the edges of the stall, and I was looking at a patch of bare earth, a few roots sticking out here and there at the edges of the hole into the underground. Madeleine stepped in front of me, made a couple of gestures to indicate I should follow her, and then dropped in. I thought it might smell like rotten fruit, or maybe ripe fruit, after reading Leah's description of the underground, but it didn't. Not where we were, at least #8212;here it just smelled like old sour dirt. Madeleine suddenly disappeared, and I stopped walking at once. Then a very small hand stuck out of what looked like solid wall until I reached out and took the hand and realized no, it was just a combination of dim light and a narrow doorway. Madeleine breathed a sigh of relief.  #8220;This is the only good part about being back down here, #8221; she said, and I kind of stared at her.  #8220;What? You wouldn't like it if #8212; #8221;  #8220;I don't think I've ever heard your voice before. #8221;  #8220;Oh. #8221; Her whiskers drooped a little, then perked back up.  #8220;I have to go find someone who can talk to someone who can talk to who you want to talk to. It's okay, though. This is close enough to the surface time won't be weird. It's where contract meetings are always held, when they have to be. #8221; I nodded and sat down on a root. Madeleine left the way she'd come. According to my phone, it was about twenty minutes later when Madeleine darted back in. She looked terrified.  #8220;She's coming, #8221; she whispered.  #8220;Please don't taunt her. *Please.* #8221; I squeezed Madeleine's hand and got to my feet, and pressed my thumb against Dale's silver ring for comfort. I had no idea what kind of creature might come walking in, but I had the feeling it wouldn't be anything I'd recognize. I wasn't wrong. If you asked me to explain what I was looking at, I literally couldn't do it. The creature in front of me would have made Dale look impossibly short; it had spiders' eyes and forever-dripping fangs easily as long as my hand, and as big around as my wrist, dangling in a drooping mouth. It had something you might describe as hair, I guess, but it looked more like roots. It was humanoid, I guess, kind of #8212;if  #8220;it has a head and two arms and two legs and stands upright #8221; is enough to qualify something as humanoid #8212;but each of its limbs had an unnerving amount of joints, and the hands had seven uncannily-long fingers each. Its skin reminded me of some kind of tree fungus, but if the fungus was free-hanging and also partly rotten. I looked up at it and tried not to gag at its nose. If you could call that a nose. It almost looked like it was just straight-up the nasal cavity in a skull.  #8220;So you are the new addition to the family, #8221; it said. It sounded like a chain smoker trying to talk through a milkshake.  #8220;We meet at last. May I have your name? #8221; I did my best to look like I'd totally expected that question #8212;maybe even a little offended by it. Tricks, yeah, okay, fine, try to fool me, but don't be so fucking blatant about it.  #8220;No. Why don't you just call me Ainsel? #8221; The Old One laughed. Genuinely amused laughter, it seemed like. There were three or four other, smaller creatures behind it, and they started laughing too.  #8220;Ah, #8221; it said.  #8220;*This* one has a brain. #8221;  #8220;I try to. What should I call you? #8221; It made another amused noise.  #8220;You may refer to me as Old Mother. #8221; *Holy shit. This might actually be the original one.*  #8220;Thank you. #8221; I held up the bag I'd slung over my back when I left King Arthur's.  #8220;I won't say it's a pleasure to meet you, because I think you and I both know I'd rather not be down here, but I will thank you for taking the time. And I brought you this as a . . . token of appreciation, I guess. I know it's an inconvenience. #8221; Old Mother took the bag. I'd filled it with as much bread and fruit as I could fit, and then thrown in a bottle of whipping cream the kitchen staff would probably go nuts over losing before sending somebody down to Kroger's.  #8220;Appreciated. #8221;  #8220;No problem. #8221; I waited for it . . . her, I guess, to settle the bag at her feet.  #8220;I have a question, and I would very, *very* much appreciate if you'd just give me a straight yes or no answer. #8221; She looked at me and didn't say anything. I took a deep breath and kept going.  #8220;You called me an addition to the family. I'm good with that. I mean, Dale's parents can go fuck themselves, but I guess it's no secret he and I are together, and I'm pretty sure we're going to stay that way. Does that mean I have some kind of control over the contract? #8221;  #8220;The contract may only be altered when the family is in agreement and terms are agreed upon. So your 'straight yes or no' answer, #8221; she said, and she sounded kind of disdainful when she said it,  #8220;would be 'no,' little Ainsel. #8221;  #8220;What if I bought it out? #8221; She stopped and stared at me, head cocked a little to one side. Her hair-root-stuff wavered a little even though there was no breeze.  #8220;Explain. #8221;  #8220;The original contract says 'we who now claim ownership of this land.' I wasn't there. I didn't claim ownership. Shit. Depending on when it happened I might not have been able to claim ownership. I might've been one of the things people were claiming ownership *of.* So strictly speaking, legally, this doesn't apply to me, because I wasn't there and couldn't have signed a contract even if I was. So what if I just . . . offer you a better deal? #8221; Old Mother folded her hands together. I tried not to watch a long rope of spit slide down one.  #8220;What 'deal' do you suggest? #8221;  #8220;Get rid of the park. #8221; She stared at me. I stared back.  #8220;I'm serious. Use of the land returns to you for everything except tax benefits, because that's a human-side thing and doesn't affect you, like . . . at all, ever. Bulldoze it and put a million trees on it, turn it into a dog park, sink it all like Atlantis, I don't give a shit, it's yours. The provisions about using your voices aboveground and not being able to walk on your land get nullified. In exchange, everybody Warin ever targeted gets returned to the state they were in before he, what the hell did he call it, 'fed' them. Infected them. Whatever you want to call it. The state we were in before that black shit got in our mouths, that's what we go back to. Leah included. And Madeleine. She wasn't one of Warin's, but she's a park employee. She was a changeling. She gets returned to how she was before that happened. Dale's family has no further interaction with you. They don't owe you anything, you don't owe them anything, it's a clean playing field. And all of us, by which I mean everybody I just mentioned but also everybody who works at the park in general, get to go live our lives without being tracked or targeted by you. #8221; She tilted her head far to one side and looked at me. I stayed quiet. I could tell she was thinking #8212;and like Dale said, I didn't want to open anything to interpretation. At last she shook her head. I had a trump card reserved for that, but I'd been really hoping I wouldn't have to use it. I closed my eyes and turned the ring around my finger. Somewhere, Dale was waiting to hear how this all turned out. I had to get it perfect.  #8220;And I'll sell you my name. #8221; There was a shocked, delighted hiss from Old Mother's entire entourage. I heard Madeleine let out a low, despairing moan. Old Mother grinned. It wasn't a nice grin. It looked like tree branches in the wind in December, but dripping black.  #8220;With one more condition, I will accept. #8221; She named it. I'm pretty sure there are times in life where everything stops, whether you want it to or not. Time might theoretically still be going by, but it's not really. The sentence that rolled out of her mouth was one of those times. I didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say. The grin remained. #8220;If you intend to seal this new contract, little Ainsel, then we will convene at the park's center at midnight. If you are late, the contract is void, and your friends will be claimed by us permanently. If you should decide the terms are, hm . . . unfavorable, your presence will still be required to reject the contract and remain under the current terms. #8221; I nodded.  #8220;Was there anything else? #8221; I shook my head.  #8220;Then I will bid you good day, little Ainsel. I believe it is about to begin. #8221; And she was gone. Dale was waiting by the bathroom when Madeleine and I climbed out. Old Mother was right #8212;it was ten to eleven, time for me to go get dressed. I wasn't sure I could. I wasn't entirely sure how I was breathing, honestly. Madeleine took one look at both of us, and let out this dismayed kind of chirp, and ran. Dale met my eyes.  #8220;How bad was it? #8221; I just started bawling. Dale pulled me against his chest, left arm tight around me, splinted one resting on the back of my head.  #8220;I can't do it. #8221; It took a lot of stuttering to get it out, but I finally did. Dale just held me.  #8220;They want me, don't they? #8221; I nodded. I've told you before Dale is one of those people who's always warm. I just tried to ignore everything I'd just heard and done in favor of the soft heat coming through his shirt.  #8220;Nate? #8221; I looked up at him. He looked back down at me, and what I saw on his face terrified me.  #8220;You said you could get my family out. You could get the kids out. #8221; I nodded.  #8220;Nate. Listen to me. #8221; He took my face in his hands, the way I did with Leah a thousand years ago, and made me look at him.  #8220;Every day of my life since they took you away I've wondered how the fuck I was supposed to live with myself knowing I'd have to turn this place over to one of the kids someday. A couple of times I thought about killing myself and then realized that wasn't doing anything except speeding up the inevitable. I talked to Mom and Dad about it, when the contract was renegotiated, and they just . . . didn't understand. I don't think Dad had time to feel anything about anything but Deanna when I was taking the park over. And Mom was never part of the park side. If I'm all it costs to make sure none of them have to face that, ever again, that's okay. #8221;  #8220;It's *not* okay #8212; #8221; He shook his head at me.  #8220;Listen. You're going to make this work, and you're going to get Leah out of here, and you're going to go back to school, and you're going to meet some guy who'll take care of you and give you everything you deserve, and I'm going to become a footnote that happened to you a long time ago. And I'm okay with that. #8221;  #8220;I'm not okay with that. #8221; Dale sighed.  #8220;How long do you have to decide? #8221;  #8220;Until midnight. #8221;  #8220;Then really think about it. Don't shake your head at me. Think about it and know that you have my *very* enthusiastic co-sign, if you can really make it work. If you're safe, and the kids are safe, that's all I care about. #8221; I just buried my face in his shirt. He stroked my back for a minute or two and kissed my forehead.  #8220;I hate doing this, Nate. Especially after what you just did. #8221;  #8220;But you have to send me to call. #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221; He squeezed me and let go. I didn't want to go to Twin Vale, but he was right: I didn't have a choice. Mitchell was already mostly dressed by the time I got there. He took a look at me when I got in and stopped halfway through buckling his belt, eyes wide.  #8220;Holy shit. Are you okay? #8221; I'd almost gotten the tears under control, but as soon as he asked I was off again. He grabbed me a bottle of water out of the minifridge and waited until I was coherent enough to talk. Then he let out a low whistle. There was a long silence.  #8220;Listen, I can't speak for all of us, #8221; he said.  #8220;I know Anne and Darius will probably say no. Oliver will say yes. But if you need . . . . you know. Planning help. So it's not a total shitshow. If you decide to go through with it, I mean. I mean, there's good ways to go and there's bad ones, you know what I mean? #8221; I nodded at him. He put a hand on my shoulder.  #8220;Hey. Throw a poncho down in the costume room and take some Advil and catch an hour. I'll pick you up around one to get on shift. You look like you need it. #8221; I decided to take his advice, but it didn't help a whole lot. When I got out into the park, it was like every single thing was being burned into my brain bright and crisp as some of Dale's photo filters. I won't forget today anytime soon. Not just the worst of it, either #8212;I mean any of it at all. The kid with the huge cotton candy. The people laughing on the porch at Doc and Kitty's. Maxine joining us at two o'clock for a stagecoach robbery. Dale's text at four o'clock, when I went on break. *I just want you to know my word still stands. And I love you.* I don't think I'd realized until that moment that neither of us had said it since we got back together. Darius sent a photo from horror around a quarter to five: Leah and Scratch, taking a break by his enclosure. She was flopped over his back with her claws resting in his fur. She actually looked more exhausted than he did. I sent out a text to the other actors before I could change my mind. *If anybody's willing to pick up the biggest bottle of Benadryl you can find while you're on break and bring it to me, I'll pay you back.* And then I sent Dale one. *I have to.* He texted back almost immediately. *Thank you.* I cried through the rest of my break. When I picked my head up my eyes were scratchy, and dry, and way blurrier than just crying should have made them. I'd literally cried my contacts out. I couldn't find them, so I decided I'd just go back out without them. I didn't need to see anymore with that nightmarish clarity anyway. In the small moments where I could sneak into alcoves and behind buildings, I texted Dale a meetup time and Mitchell my plan. He told me to meet the rest of the crew in Casablanca at nine. Dale didn't turn up to fireworks. I wasn't sure if I was upset to not have the time to spend with him, or if I was relieved to not have to face him. At nine, I found myself facing the rest of the crew. Casablanca closed early #8212;a lot of things in the park did, on the last night #8212;so it was just us and Alex, doing her last-minute checks before heading out. She spotted me and blew me a kiss. I didn't have the heart to return it, so I just waved. Then it was just dead quiet, except for the Pianist. I was hoping somebody might be angry, or accusing, but they were all just giving me the saddest looks I've ever seen. Anne stepped forward with a bottle in her hands.  #8220;I have one of those store membership cards, #8221; she said, and handed me the bottle. Six hundred pills.  #8220;You don't have to pay me back. #8221; And then she burst into tears. I didn't have enough left to burst, but I started crying too. Maxine hugged her, and then me too. Mitchell handed me a totally different bottle. Two, actually.  #8220;I #8212; #8221; I stopped and looked down. Maxine took my hand.  #8220;Better out than in, Nathan, just say it. #8221;  #8220;I'm going to need you guys to gather your pretenders at the Hollywood bathroom around a quarter to twelve. Don't be late. Caroline, I know you can't, but you'll probably have to come back here for him when we're done. I can't help, I have to #8212; #8221; I guess I had enough left to burst after all, because I did. Caroline and Maxine wrapped their arms around me. I wanted to push them both off and tell them I didn't exactly deserve sympathy for murdering my boyfriend, but I wanted to cry more than that, so I just stayed put. Somebody took the bottles out of my hands at some point, and when I finally tapered off again and they let go Darius was standing by the bar, looking deeply regretful and pouring pint glasses of whiskey through a strainer back into the bottle Mitchell'd handed me. He capped it and brought it back to me.  #8220;I grabbed a rolling pin first, #8221; he said.  #8220;They're mostly dissolved, but it's not the full bottle. I think it hit as much as it could actually hold. There's a few hundred in there, anyway. #8221; I nodded at him. Maxine hugged me again.  #8220;Think I'm going to send Anne and Mitchell to go pack Leah's old room, #8221; she said.  #8220;Where are you meeting him? #8221;  #8220;Horror. The [Whacky Shack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4i3ekK6miQ). It was his favorite ride when he was a kid. #8221; I paused.  #8220;Might've stopped a car in the perspective hallway after hours once with him. #8221; She started laughing, the way you do when it's surprised out of you. Then she took my hand and picked up the second bottle.  #8220;I'll walk you over and get everything out of the breakrooms. Since I don't have a pretender to worry about. #8221; I nodded. Then I stopped.  #8220;Why the hell is everyone so okay with this? Why isn't anybody asking what the fuck I'm doing? Running me right out of here? #8221; Maxine sighed. Then she met my eyes.  #8220;Dale texted us after you texted him. He told us the last instruction he's giving us as our boss is to make sure you go through with it. And that you're okay, afterwards. I don't think any of us would be okay with it if he wasn't. But he's . . . he's *weird* okay with it. #8221;  #8220;He doesn't want to have to hand the place off to his nieces and nephews. It's why he never wanted kids himself. #8221; Maxine thought about it, then nodded a little.  #8220;Guess I'd die for that too. #8221; She dropped me off at the control booth with one last hug. I flipped on the power and the blacklights and turned off the sound effects. The Whacky Shack is a darkride, and most of its effects are just fluorescent paint under blacklights, but done in a way that really fucks with your sense of perspective. There are sound effects, though, and they're about as cheesy as you'd expect from something that went up in 1965. One of Eileen's rides, actually. Maybe the only surviving one. Dale was waiting for me at the ride car sitting outside on the tracks. He raised the lap bar. It took him both hands #8212;they're not hydraulic, but they *are* solid steel. I tried to squint so I could at least meet his eyes, but mine were too swollen. I should've washed my face before heading over. I just held up the bottle.  #8220;According to the internet, #8221; I said, and I had to stop and cough and clear my throat before I could keep going.  #8220;You're comatose before any of the . . . frightening parts happen. #8221; He just nodded and slid into the car. I got in beside him and at least tried to help him pull the lap bar down. Even he had to lean on it with both arms to make it go. There's normally a ride attendant to do it for you, and it's a lot easier from the outside. I uncapped my water bottle and handed him the whiskey, then hit the button on the inspection remote and leaned against him, wondering why the hell he hadn't put on a coat #8212;it was bitter enough outside even he was cold. He put an arm around me and we rattled through. I sipped my water, trying to stave off the inevitable headache. I heard him gulp next to me, a couple of times. I wasn't sure if he was trying to get through the whole fifth or not, but at least he seemed to be enjoying it. Sounds stupid, doesn't it? I didn't want him to suffer while I killed him. We went around five or six times. Maybe even a couple more. Then I stopped the car in the middle of the tracks, in the deepest part of the ride. Dale kind of roused himself, but I could already tell there'd be no permanent rousing happening #8212;he was sluggish, and kind of slewed sideways into me just trying to sit up without the car to support him.  #8220;Nathan? #8221; Even my name came out slurred.  #8220;I have to leave you here. #8221; I started crying again.  #8220;They spent your entire fucking life telling you what to do, where to go, how to behave, who to fucking love, they don't get your body on top of that, Dale. #8221; I pulled the second bottle from under the seat. This was no fifth of whiskey #8212;it used to be one of Casablanca's jug-sized handles, but one of the other crew had filled it with kerosene and wiped down the outside for easy handling.  #8220;Viking fucking funeral. #8221; He let out a laugh that kind of sounded like rocks on a cheese grater, and tapered off in the middle as he nodded for a second. I wondered #8212;with all the morbidity you can possibly get #8212;how many of his organs were already shut down.  #8220;Kiss me goodbye? #8221; I was going to make it a good one for old times' sake, but I couldn't stop crying long enough. Finally I kissed his cheek, and then his forehead, and whispered  #8220;I love you too #8221; into his ear before I forced the lap bar high enough to let me out. I found the wall in the dark, and uncapped the jug, using my shoulder on the wall to lead while I poured a trickle of kerosene along old dry plywood. I still had a little left when I found the exit doors, and I dumped it in a puddle before stepping back and striking a match. Then I ran as far across the plaza as I could get before I heard the *foom* of air suddenly igniting. I sat on one of the benches across the plaza and watched a line of fire travel rapidly down the hall, then start licking its way curiously upward. And then I started crying harder than ever, feeling the heat of the fire slowly increase. It had to be almost all the way back to Dale by now. He was so cold when I got out of the car, hands icy, cheek frigid. I had to wonder if he was awake to feel that last little bit of heat. I was pretty sure not, and not just because I was trying to comfort myself. He'd downed most of the fifth in about five minutes flat, and then we rode for another twenty on top of it. He taught me how to balance a budget, trust my own judgment, and fuck like it was the last night on earth. I taught him how to slice vegetables without slicing himself, change a tire, and in the end I taught him how to die. One of us got a very, very bad end of that deal. Eventually I felt someone sit down next to me. Two someones, actually. I ignored them until one of them took my hand.  #8220;Nathan. #8221; It was Oliver.  #8220;It's after eleven. You've got to get a move on. #8221; I just kind of ignored him. Somebody else took my other hand.  #8220;Listen, #8221; said Caroline's voice.  #8220;I know you're not going to be done crying for a very long time. And if you want to keep going until sunup once this is all over, I'll sit up with you. But if you don't keep going now, then this was for nothing. #8221; I finally nodded and let them pull me to my feet. It didn't even feel like they were my feet anymore. I was okay with that.  #8220;Where to next? #8221;  #8220;Leah. #8221;  #8220;She's with Scratch. We saw her on the way in. #8221; Oliver steered me toward the enclosure. Leah was waiting for us, Scratch's leash wrapped around her hand. There were tears in her eyes, too.  #8220;I have to ask you to do something that's going to hurt you, #8221; I told her.  #8220;A lot. But the good news is, after midnight, I never have to do it again. #8221; Leah nodded. I reached into my shirt pocket and pulled out the ring Dale gave me that morning, a little piece of paper rolled up inside it.  #8220;I have to ask you to take this. And when I sign that contract, *as soon* as I sign it, no matter what you feel, no matter what it looks like, you have to read this. You can't forget. #8221; She nodded again, that don't-fight-me-you'll-lose look on her face again. I tucked the ring into her costume pocket and heard her hiss as the silver settled.  #8220;I'm sorry. It's shitty. But if you can't touch it, neither can they. #8221; She nodded one last time. The four of us #8212;five, with Scratch #8212;headed for Hollywood. Darius was already waiting, the nurse standing and swaying by the bathroom. Maxine was leading the Diva. Anne and Mitchell were coming up behind with Madeleine. She looked vaguely uncomfortable.  #8220;She wanted to bring her tiger, #8221; Anne told me.  #8220;I told her it was probably better if she put him in the car for now. #8221; I nodded at her and waited for the bathroom to open.

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm A Murderer [Part 29, section two]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-05 15:59:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Section One](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gx78wl/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; We didn't have to wait long. Old Mother, when she came, more or less *oozed* out, like a cat that somehow fit into an area that shouldn't be possible. Mitchell and Oliver both swore. Anne let out a squeak. Caroline gasped. Maxine muttered *oh sweet baby Jesus.*  #8220;Little Ainsel, #8221; she greeted me. She looked sort of sour.  #8220;These are your friends? #8221;  #8220;All except the Pianist. He won't be able to move until you keep up your end of the bargain. Where are yours? #8221;  #8220;Mine, little Ainsel? #8221;  #8220;Your friends. Warin's not here? #8221; The sour expression deepened.  #8220;He is dead. #8221; I sighed in relief. The last person on fucking earth I wanted to see on my way out of this hellhole was the Laughing motherfucking Cowboy. Then I squared my shoulders. Everything was going to depend on whether I could talk her into one last thing.  #8220;The deal's halfway through, #8221; I told her.  #8220;I made my sacrifice. #8221; I felt everything #8212;words and screams and possibly also what little dinner I'd managed to eat #8212;try to come up my throat, and forced it to stop. For Dale's sake.  #8220;Now release your sacrifices and victims, and then I'll sign. Tit for tat. One action equals one action. #8221; She raised a hand. I heard a heavy thud, and an *oof,* and then a very *human* childish squeal. I turned around. Oliver was supporting an older woman in a long dress with her hair up in a sophisticated chignon. Leah was on the ground, laughing helplessly while an absolutely giant gray dog #8212;who looked a lot more like a terrier than I would've expected #8212;licked her face. Caroline took off for Casablanca. And then I saw what, or *who,* made the thud. Leave it to the motherfucking Wild Ones, I thought. The drop-dead gorgeous girl from the long-ago headshot was gone #8212;one eye dangling freely down her face, the other swelled shut. Her jaw was broken in so many places I could see bone poking out of the skin. She'd almost undoubtedly fallen not because of her face, but because her legs were swollen to the point of being black from the pressure of the fractures in them #8212;it looked like Warin had essentially turned them into stockings full of marbles. One of her hands was crushed, and her belly was swollen. I grabbed the only good hand she had left, and she turned in my direction before wincing and grabbing her stomach with her mangled fingers.  #8220;Rick? #8221; *Shit.* I'd actually forgotten he was the manager when she was turned.  #8220;No. I'm #8212;I'm another actor. It's going to be okay. We just need to get you to a hospital. #8221;  #8220;Oh, snap, #8221; she said. Or tried to say. With her jaw it came out more like *o-sah.* I'm pretty sure you actually had to be a nineties kid to know what she was saying. She suddenly heaved forward and vomited, turning what little of her costume was still white a bright, bloody red. And then she went limp. I stared up at Old Mother, trying not to be recklessly pissed and failing.  #8220;What the fuck happened to her? #8221; There was an amused noise.  #8220;You are a very smart man, little Ainsel. For a human. Surely you can see for yourself. #8221; I knew she knew I meant something else, but I was already riding on a knife-edge. I didn't dare take it any further. I just gave Madeleine and Grace and Leah some quick once-overs to be sure nobody else was about to keel over on me. No question about Mr. Scratch #8212;he'd finally let Leah off the ground, but he was absolutely delighted to not be a sock puppet anymore.  #8220;Okay, #8221; I said, loudly enough to catch everyone's attention. I said a quick prayer #8212;I didn't know if anybody up there had an interest in helping the likes of me, but if they did I was going to need all the help I could get #8212;and took a deep breath.  #8220;Okay. Not cool, but you got me there. Leah, control your dog, he's huge. #8221;  #8220;I had no idea wolfhounds were *this big.* #8221;  #8220;Yeah, you're gonna need a bigger apartment. #8221; I looked back at Old Mother's many, many eyes.  #8220;I'll sign my name. #8221; The response was instantaneous, and also unanimous #8212;even from Grace, who'd just gotten back to being human ninety seconds ago. Everybody said no. Or  #8220;fucking hell, #8221; if they were Mitchell. Madeleine started crying. Anne pulled Madeleine tight against her legs. I found a pen in my shirt pocket and approached the weird yellowed paper Old Mother was holding out. I stopped and pulled out my phone.  #8220;Rick's going to need this, #8221; I told her, and took a picture of it before sending it to the work chat.  #8220;Can somebody make sure it gets forwarded to him? #8221; I didn't wait for an answer. I just took the pen and scribbled #8212;seven syllables, two first three middle two last #8212;and closed my eyes, and heard someone read them off. When I opened my eyes again, I didn't know where I was. I was standing in front of some kind of being who looked like an absolutely huge nightmare tree. There were noises behind me, and I turned around to see a group of people, a few of them crying. I felt like I knew them, or should know them, but I didn't.  #8220;Time to go, #8221; said the nightmare tree. One of the people, a girl with dark brown hair and very green eyes, lurched forward.  #8220;Wait! #8221;  #8220;The contract has been signed, #8221; the tree said.  #8220;The terms are agreed #8212; #8221;  #8220;I know, #8221; the girl said.  #8220;Just #8212;just give me just a minute. Just to say goodbye. #8221; The tree waved something like a hand. The girl ran up to me and threw her arms around my neck. Then she whispered something in my ear, so low and fast I almost couldn't keep up with it. But I did. That was the important part. I closed my eyes and smiled.  #8220;Thanks, Leah. #8221;  #8220;Nathan, #8221; Old Mother said.  #8220;It's time to go. #8221; I stopped and looked up at her.  #8220;Who's Nathan? #8221; She stopped, too. Something had gone horribly wrong, and she knew it, but she couldn't figure it out. Not yet.  #8220;*You* are #8212; #8221;  #8220;Me? Nah. That's not my name. #8221; I grinned at her.  #8220;I sold it to you, remember? #8221;  #8220;*You #8212;! That isn't what that phrase means!* #8221;  #8220;No? So sorry. That's how *I* understood it. #8221; I turned to the rest of the actors.  #8220;That's what it means, guys, isn't it? You sell something, it doesn't belong to you anymore, it belongs to the person you sold it to? #8221; There was a general murmur of agreement. Old Mother let out a terrible hiss.  #8220;You will *come #8212;* #8221;  #8220;Nah. #8221; I shrugged.  #8220;There was nothing in the terms about going anywhere with anybody. There *is* power in names, though, you guys are right about that, so maybe, since I sold you my name and it's yours now, you might want to just quiet down and finish the job before I figure out how to really get going on using that . . . *Nathan.* #8221; I didn't know spider eyes could look that full of fear, but you learn something new every day, I guess. I just turned to the crew again.  #8220;Come on, guys, let's go home. #8221; And then a rapidly-growing tree almost speared right through my foot. Nobody needed telling twice. We all ran for the exit as fast as we could go, screaming directions to each other because a few hundred trees growing all at once creates one hell of a noise, and also because even if it didn't the situation just seemed to call for screaming somehow. There was a dismayed *oh!* and Oliver stopped for a second to hoist Grace onto his back before booking it again. Caroline joined us, leading a tall, spare man with a ruler-straight part in his hair, as we passed Casablanca. And then we got to the parking lot #8212;also rapidly filling in #8212;and I realized just how big a problem we had. Mitchell's car was still out of commission. Oliver was parked at the gas station because he'd had an overheat on the way in. Anne, Maxine, and Caroline all came in together, in Caroline's Jeep. And Leah's car was full of all of our stuff. I shoved Leah at the Jeep and pushed her car keys into Mitchell's hands before running back through the park gates. Dale's office was open. I didn't question it #8212;I was just grateful I didn't have to try to break the window. I stumbled over his jacket as I ran in, and caught myself on the corner of the desk. The picture of the two of us sitting on the corner of it fell over: two men, two boys, really, sitting under the weeping willow looking at each other like the rest of the world didn't exist, laughing in the sunlight. I hauled myself back to my feet. Most of the office was already taken over by shooting vines #8212;toppling the filing cabinet, forcing open the desk drawer where he used to keep a bottle, cracking the window Warin used to claim control #8212;but there was a bare patch about the size of my fist on the wall, and Dale's keys were right in the middle of it, right along with the iron churchkey he kept for beer bottles. I grabbed the ring and snapped it off the lanyard, already too buried in vines to be of any use, and ran for the parking lot again. The girls were already gone, and Darius had taken off with Madeleine and Mr. Scratch. Mitchell saw me waving a set of keys and peeled out of the parking lot. I pushed the key fob a lot harder than I really had to and threw myself at the driver's door.  #8220;Everybody inside! #8221; Oliver yanked open the passenger door and helped Grace and Robert in before hoisting himself in and yanking the door shut. I'd always wondered why Dale bothered with a full-size cab, but I didn't have time to do anything but be grateful for it now. I jammed the key in the ignition, then stopped and took a pair of deep breaths before turning it on and hitting the accelerator. I threw it out of park and felt it stall.  #8220;Fucking *damn it,* Dale, you and your fucking *stick!* #8221; I tried the whole process again and stalled out.  #8220;Come on! #8221; *If you'd stop freaking out every time you approach traffic, you'd stop stalling. Accelerator and stick at the same time, Nate, you'll flood out the engine.* The truck roared to life. I backed up, dinged the bed door on a maple that wasn't there a few seconds prior, turned a wide donut through an area that'd been fenced off when I first ran out, and peeled toward the highway, swerving as parts of the park road broke apart under the force of new roots. I wondered if Dale'd ever run the truck up to ninety before. I wondered if he'd ever done it and wished he wasn't in it alone. I finally hit asphalt. The other three drivers were waiting for me, and I threw the truck into park before putting my head on the wheel and starting to sob again.  #8220;Is he quite all right? #8221; I heard a woman's voice say behind me. It was strangely accented #8212;not foreign, but *old.* Grace, still straight out of 1962.  #8220;His husband was the sacrifice that got us all out of the park. #8221; I didn't bother correcting Oliver.  #8220;Boyfriend #8221; sixty years ago meant something a lot different anyway.  #8220;Oh. Oh, my dear. I am so *very* sorry. #8221; I felt an unfamiliar hand on my shoulder. I didn't bother reaching for it. I heard Oliver get out and figured he was probably talking to the other drivers. I didn't really care. Everybody was out. Fantastic. I just had to live with it now. Mitchell was the one who came back to the truck. He helped me out of the driver's seat, swung himself up into it, and then looked down at the gearshift and the pedals and I heard him let out a very quiet *fuck.* I swiped my arm across my eyes.  #8220;I can drive. #8221;  #8220;You don't even have your contacts and you've been crying for like twelve hours straight. I just have to remember how to use a manual transmission. #8221;  #8220;Why, what else would it be? #8221; Robert sounded puzzled.  #8220;Do you not drive often? #8221;  #8220;Uh, most cars these days are automatic. I don't think I've ever driven a stick shift. #8221;  #8220;I said I can drive #8212; #8221;  #8220;I could manage reasonably, I think, if one of you could provide me with directions. #8221; I ended up in the backseat with Grace and Mitchell giving directions. She kept patting my shoulder, and at one point she offered me her hanky. I wiped my eyes with it until it was too wet to be any use. We ended up at Dale's apartment. Everybody staked out floor space and started grabbing things like couch cushions. I just wandered out to the kitchen. Things were happening, around me, strictly speaking to me, but I didn't care. I couldn't. I was pretty sure if I started caring I was going to start screaming, and then I'd go crazy, and it'd probably be a relief but if I did I had no idea who'd make sure Madeleine got home. Caroline came out to the kitchen and sat down next to me before taking my hand.  #8220;We're not leaving you tonight, #8221; she said.  #8220;But we're leaving the bedroom for you. #8221; I just kind of nodded. She squeezed my hand. Everybody was sacked out within half an hour. Caroline, Maxine, and Darius all offered to sit up with me, but I turned them down. I think Leah meant to, but she and Madeleine were so tired they literally fell asleep sitting against each other and had to be put to bed. So now I'm just laying in our bed, wondering if I'm ever going to sleep again without seeing Dale's eyes and hearing him ask if I'd kiss him goodbye. Wondering if the fire went on long enough to do what I intended it to do #8212;not just to destroy the body, but to encase whatever was left in a river of molten iron from the ride tracks. Smelling his shampoo and aftershave on his pillow and trying to let it sink in I'm never going to smell it on his skin again. It's the little things, you know. I'll let you all know what happens to Madeleine tomorrow. I'm not sure there's anything else to say. I don't even know what's going to happen to me after tomorrow, honestly. I'll have to figure it out. Eventually. But right now I just want to cry. [Part 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gxttsz/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean new ground in the sense that usually, it #8217;s the background work he does that #8217;s most important. But in this case, the specific movement itself is very new compared to other, similar causes (BLM = five years, compare to NAACP = 111 years). That means the work to be done is somewhat different. Like, example #8212;when he did work with the Childline in the UK, he didn #8217;t have to be loud about it because everybody knows what it is, what it #8217;s for, etc. Saying  #8220;I #8217;m raising money #8221; was enough. BLM still needs legitimacy because it #8217;s new and it #8217;s got the media against it. Being louder and more outspoken is important. It wouldn #8217;t surprise me if it was fans saying so that made him realize he can #8217;t let his music speak for itself and do his good work quietly on this one (or put another way: Hozier gets onstage and screams  #8220;Nina Cried Power #8221; and encourages people to be activists, Andrew quietly donates money and tries to lead by the example of not doing racist shit), but the situation itself is pretty unusual. I #8217;m not sure he #8217;s ever worked for a new-ish organization before that didn #8217;t have a near-universally-agreed-upon support (child abuse is bad, domestic abuse is bad, cancer is bad #8212;nobody argues these things).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because some people have nothing to be proud of except a genetic accident, and it shows. It also occurred to me, at least part of the delay might have been paperwork. It #8217;d be nice if he could snap his fingers and say  #8220;this belongs to these groups now, #8221; but he would #8217;ve had to negotiate with Rubyworks, then contact BLM and NAACP, work out royalties ratios, get their banking information to Rubyworks, have his own removed, all while dodging time zones, that #8217;s A LOT. Imagine if he #8217;d said  #8220;I #8217;m doing this #8221; and everybody ran to download JBJ with no idea the money was still on its way to him because paperwork wasn #8217;t done yet.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not: I'm Happy [Part 30; FINAL PART]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-06 16:15:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Part 29, section two](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/gx79bt/i_used_to_be_a_stagecoach_driver_and_now_im_not/)  #8203; I'd like to officially retract what I said yesterday about winning if you could call this winning. I *actually* won. Totally because of an accident, but you know what? I'll take it. What I'd planned to tell you all today #8212;you know, for closure's sake #8212;was how I got Madeleine home and Grace and Robert on their way to Dale's parents. I fell asleep last night crying and trying to figure out how exactly I was going to call the police and tell them I had a little kid who wasn't mine. I woke up in Dale's arms. At first I thought I was hallucinating. Then I thought all of yesterday must have been a nightmare, and then I basically threw myself across him so I could get to his face and kiss him awake, hands in his hair. And then three things registered at once: There was blood on his temple, and ash on my hands, and his scars were gone. I fell asleep on Dale's side of the bed last night, and as soon as it all hit me I yanked the drawer out of the nightstand and scrabbled in it, hoping like hell one of his oldest habits hadn't changed since Leah was here. Which is why the first thing he saw when he finally got a single eye open was his own gun pointed at his chest.  #8220;Tell me who the fuck you are, or I'm going to shoot you. #8221; There was a pause while he actually got fully awake. Then he just stared up at me, puzzled.  #8220;No you're not. #8221;  #8220;I murdered a man last night, I really don't give a shit, I *will* shoot you. #8221; He rolled his eyes.  #8220;Not trying to pull the gunsight with the safety on, you won't. #8221; I grabbed a different part of the gun. I fired it a couple of times when he first brought it home, but that was on a range with an instructor almost twelve years ago.  #8220;Fuck's sake. #8221; He pushed himself up to sitting. I tried to shoot the gun and realized I was holding the trigger guard. He moved my hand, grabbed my free hand and put it around my other wrist, and then gave me an incredibly unimpressed look.  #8220;Seriously, you'd think after last night's fiasco you'd learn. Now that you're more likely to hit me than yourself, do you want to explain what the hell is going on? #8221;  #8220;Dale's dead. So whatever sick bullshit you're trying to pull, you're going to get off it now, or I'm going to kill you. #8221;  #8220;Understandable thought, but no, you didn't actually beat my brains out, you just gave me one *hell* of a concussion. #8221; He paused.  #8220;Want me to prove it? Because I'll prove it. You'll have to name your criteria, but it won't be hard. #8221; And then I realized he was still wearing the silver ring I'd put on his finger yesterday. I nodded at it.  #8220;Let me see that. #8221; He held up his hand. I opened my mouth to elaborate and he went *oh* and slipped it off his finger before staring at the inside and then holding it up to me.  #8220;You're looking for this part, aren't you. #8221; .925. Real silver. And no burn marks on his finger where it'd been sitting, either.  #8220;Horseshoe's still above the front door, too, just if you're wondering. #8221; I started bawling, which I personally think is a pretty reasonable response to finding out three minutes after you woke up that you didn't *actually* commit murder ten hours prior, and he wrapped his arms around me. I heard a minor commotion, and then Dale let go of me enough for me to look up and spot Oliver and Mitchell in the doorway. Oliver had a chef's knife in his hand.  #8220;Put that right back where you found it, Oliver, I swear to Christ. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, don't threaten to misuse his good knives, he'll hurt you, #8221; Dale chimed in. I started giggling. I think it was more like hysterics, actually. You can only take so much crazy bullshit before you start losing it.  #8220;Okay, so like, I can't tell you guys to get a room because this *is* your room, but a little clarity would be nice. #8221;  #8220;Let me get him calmed down and get dressed and we'll see you in the living room in a couple of minutes. #8221; I'm pretty sure that's when I knew for absolute certain it was actually Dale. He's great at handling emotional breakdowns, as long as they're not his own. I was almost back down to normal when it occurred to me I was pushing my comfort off onto somebody I'd just tried to kill, and I pulled back with my arms around myself.  #8220;Sorry, I . . . sorry. #8221;  #8220;For what? #8221; Dale tipped my face up so I had to look at him.  #8220;You didn't do anything I didn't ask you to do. #8221;  #8220;I should've never put you in a position to have to decide #8212; #8221; I don't personally think the thing in movies where you kiss somebody to shut them up is romantic, or even okay. Dale kissing me just then was the exception that proves the rule, because I probably would've just ended up crying again.  #8220;You don't have anything to apologize for. But if it makes you feel better, I'll say I forgive you. Okay? #8221; I nodded. Then I winced. Extreme panic is a great way to forget your hysterics headache, but sooner or later it comes back to you. He stroked my back a couple of times and swung his legs off the bed before pausing.  #8220;The door's actually closed, right? I can't see shit from your side of the bed. #8221;  #8220;Yeah. #8221;Dale went to forage for clean clothes. I didn't actually have any #8212;the times I stayed over he usually just threw my stuff in the wash #8212;but his tee-shirts are big enough on me I could put one on over my shorts and call it decent. I stumbled into the living room. Leah and Madeleine were still sleeping on the sofa pullout, and so was Anne, but everyone else was awake. I could hear somebody in the kitchen, too, and when I peered through the doorway I saw Darius putting together toast. I just sat down on the floor and hugged a pillow.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221; Maxine was giving me this look like I'd just died. I shook my head. Slowly. Then I kind of gestured at my eyes before she could get the idea there was a bigger problem.  #8220;Headache? #8221;  #8220;Mm. #8221; Dale sat down next to me right around the time Darius came out with a plate full of toast. The living room is a lot brighter than the bedroom, and I could see a few pieces of bright blue plastic over his temple #8212;stitches. He reached for a triangle of toast in a paper towel and made me take it.  #8220;Oliver asked me to explain. So I'll try. You all already know we had an agreement last night to dissolve the contract, with my consent. Nathan came to the office right before fireworks with Colt's old revolver to finish the job, but either it was empty or he couldn't figure out how to shoot it, which after this morning should surprise absolutely nobody, so he pistolwhipped me. I'm pretty sure #8212; #8221;  #8220;Wait, wait, wait, he was definitely not at the office right before fireworks. He and I walked over from Twin Vale together. #8221; Mitchell didn't even say please before interrupting.  #8220;And there was definitely no revolver involved in the plan here, I helped him put it together specifically because he didn't want to hurt you. #8221;  #8220;I didn't even see you after I got on shift, #8221; I said.  #8220;When you didn't show for fireworks I figured you were watching them from horror. #8221; Dale stared at me like I'd lost my mind.  #8220;Why the hell would I go to horror for fireworks? You can't see anything from there. #8221;  #8220;I don't know, why didn't you come to Hollywood? #8221;  #8220;Because I was passed out in the office with a head wound, Nathan. I came to sometime after the park was gone, walked out of the woods, and called an Uber to the hospital. Then I came home. #8221;  #8220;He's not Nathan. #8221; It was the first thing I'd heard Leah say since she saved me, the night before. She was trying to find her way to sitting up on the pullout, which is a lot harder than it sounds, because there's a whole pillowtop that goes on it. It's almost as comfortable as a regular bed. Dale stared at her.  #8220;I think I know who hit me in the face, Leah. #8221;  #8220;What she means is I'm not Nathan *anymore.* I sold my name, and she gave me a new one. No strings. #8221; The most important part of what she'd whispered, when she'd given it to me: *it's a gift to you for free, you don't owe me anything.* I didn't tell her to do it #8212;she thought of it on her own and it probably saved me. Dale swiveled to stare at me. Under different circumstances, the look on his face would've been hilarious.  #8220;You did *what?* #8221;  #8220;That was the price to dissolve the contract. I sold my name. But that meant I didn't have one anymore, so Leah gave me a new one. #8221; I tried to grin at him without looking like a maniac. I'm not sure how well it worked with literally every possible emotion in the universe hanging out right under my skin, but I gave it a shot.  #8220;I'm Michael now. #8221; Dale made a face.  #8220;Michael. #8221;  #8220;That a problem? #8221;  #8220;I am *not* calling you Mike. #8221; I made a face back at him.  #8220;Oh, fuck no. What do I look like, somebody's dad at a white so-called barbecue? #8221; Dale snickered, but even under the laughter I could see him thinking. When he finally got his face straight again he met my eyes.  #8220;Mickey? #8221;  #8220;I can live with Mickey. #8221;  #8220;Okay. Finish your toast. #8221; I took a bite and then stopped.  #8220;Wait. Maxine, you *saw* him at the Whacky Shack, didn't you? I didn't just . . . hallucinate all that? #8221;  #8220;Sure did. He was far away, but he was waiting for you on the loading dock. #8221;  #8220;You didn't hallucinate *shit,* #8221; Oliver said.  #8220;Caroline and I picked you up. I was surprised you hadn't already puked your guts from crying so hard. And nobody's that good an actor. #8221; I dropped my toast. *I know someone who is.* Then I went running to the bathroom. I tripped over Robert on the way, and I probably should've apologized, but I was too desperate to get to the mirror. Leah was the one who grabbed my shoulder to bring me back down to earth.  #8220;It still looks like you? #8221; I took a deep breath to try and stave off panic.  #8220;It still looks like me. #8221;  #8220;Chew this. #8221; It was a leaf off the bay plant she'd given me, now sitting by the window in the apartment. I bit into it and made a face.  #8220;Ugh. Why do they taste so good in soup and so fucking *bitter* by themselves? #8221;  #8220;Are they supposed to taste that way? #8221;  #8220;Yeah. That's why you always take them out before you serve. #8221;  #8220;Then I think you're okay. #8221; I hugged her, hard. She felt different #8212;still slim, but not downright bony anymore. I peeked down her shoulder and spotted a flash of color.  #8220;You have tattoos again! #8221;  #8220;I do? #8221; She stripped off her shirt and turned with her back to the mirror, craning to see.  #8220;I do! #8221; She hugged me again, and shooed me back to the living room while she got her shirt back on. Dale looked concerned.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, I think so. Hey, when I met you at the office, did I say anything? #8221;  #8220;Not a word. I thought it was weird, but after that everything was so fast I didn't really have a chance to worry about it. #8221;  #8220;You didn't either. Not until I was walking off the ride. #8221; I gagged.  #8220;I almost frenched that motherfucker. *On purpose.* #8221; Dale went from concerned to alarmed.  #8220;*What?* #8221;  #8220;It's okay, I didn't. Apparently being a crybaby can save your damn life sometimes. #8221; And then I started giggling.  #8220;Oh, fuck. When she said Warin was dead. Like really dead. No questions. Dale, *I burned down the Whacky Shack.* #8221; And then I had hysterics. You understand. It was that kind of morning. Eventually I managed to calm down. Dale was holding me in his lap, and the first thing I thought was *well that's unprofessional* and then I let out this really shrill giggle and then I was okay again.  #8220;Hold on, hold on. You back with us now? #8221; I nodded.  #8220;Do you want to explain what's so important about burning down the Whacky Shack? #8221;  #8220;I brought a fifth of whiskey full of Benadryl. He chugged it thinking he'd be able to walk it off because he's not human. It might incapacitate him down for awhile, but it wouldn't kill him. But he didn't know I was going to torch the place. He literally just had to sit there while the car melted into the tracks and trapped him in a puddle of iron. Not only is he dead, they're never going to get him back out of there. And it's their own fault, because they never actually asked for you by name, they had to be all fucking #8212;*poetic* about it, 'give us the one who for ten years made you weep' and they never thought about that motherfucker laying up on the stagecoach roof or keeping you away from me to begin with, *so it still worked.* #8221; I thought I was going to be hysterical again, but Grace let out this  #8220;my *word* #8221; that kind of softened it up to only mild distress.  #8220;And now what shall we do? #8221;  #8220;Well. Speaking from personal experience. Don't leave the house for a month or so, because you *will* piss yourself at least once before you remember what using the bathroom feels like. Expect everything to make you cry even when it's totally not appropriate. Or laugh. Same thing. Actually kind of *especially* when it's not appropriate, I'm pretty sure that venom stuff just sort of coats your brain transmitters or something until you can't really feel anything and when it wears off your hormones don't know what to do with any of this information for awhile. Absolutely everything is going to taste different. Probably especially for you, when did you get turned? 1960-something? Didn't they have different bananas back then? #8221;  #8220;Na #8212;Mickey. #8221; Dale's voice was soft.  #8220;I think what she meant was she and Robert have been presumed dead for sixty years. They can't exactly just go to the DMV for an update like you did. #8221;  #8220; . . . oh. #8221; Right.  #8220;Um, your family probably knows people, right? #8221;  #8220;They're called the Fixers, and yes. Pretty much anybody who deals with things like the Wild Ones knows who they are. They handle all that kind of weird stuff. I've heard some absolutely wild stuff about this campground place they handle from my direct contact. I'll have to make some phone calls. #8221;  #8220;Okay. #8221; I looked up at Grace.  #8220;I'm serious about the peeing yourself thing, though, like really do yourself a favor and just go to the bathroom every two hours until you remember what it feels like when you've got to go. #8221;  #8220;Much appreciated. #8221; Robert looked a little nonplussed, but Grace looked like absolutely nothing about this was weird to her. Probably because she was theatre people, if I remembered Leah's blog right.  #8220;So we've got to #8212;what? Get ID for Grace and Robert, probably find somebody who can help them get used to being in the 21st century, *oh.* We have to get Madeleine back home #8212;hey, kiddo, you're awake! #8221; Madeleine sat up on the pullout and stretched.  #8220;Huh? #8221; She looked around. Caroline gave her this little wave. Anne #8212;just barely awake herself #8212;offered up a giant sleepy smile. Maxine had the best idea, though, and that was pulling a cosmetic mirror out of her purse and handing it over. Have you ever heard a little kid who's so blindingly happy they scream and murder the eardrums of everybody in a fifty-foot radius? Yeah, that was the living room when Madeleine saw her own human face looking back at her. She more or less launched herself off the end of the bed into Maxine's arms, and after hugs all around I went to the bedroom to grab my phone off the charger.  #8220;You know what? I know exactly how I'm going to handle this. Hey Mads, what's your mom's phone number? #8221;  #8220;Cascade 8-2196. It's an Idaho exchange. #8221; She looked rather proud at being able to rattle it off. I just shook my head.  #8220;Her phone number, hon, not her email. #8221;  #8220;That *is* her phone number! Cascade doesn't have exchange neighborhoods, it's too little. #8221;  #8220;Cascade isn't *that* small. Not for Idaho, #8221; Dale said.  #8220;My whole family's in Boise. And even small towns use the ten-digit system. #8221;  #8220;That's a standard phone number, #8221; Robert said.  #8220;Not in line for the automatic system yet, but #8212; #8221;  #8220;Wait. #8221; Dale cut through the debate that was almost certainly going to follow Robert.  #8220;Weird question. When you were all first turned, who was the President? #8221;  #8220;Obama. I don't know what the fuck went so wrong. #8221;  #8220;Mr. John F. Kennedy, of course, #8221; said Grace.  #8220;Oh, please tell me it hasn't been so long he and his wife are passed. They were such a lovely couple. #8221; Robert winced.  #8220;Lyndon B. Johnson. #8221; Grace sat up even straighter and stared at him like she meant to stab him with her eyeballs.  #8220;Robert, if you tell me that man *split the nomination #8212;* #8221;  #8220;Oh shit, you don't know about the Kennedy assassination, #8221; Oliver said. Grace turned the stare onto him.  #8220;I *beg* your *pardon #8212;* #8221;  #8220;Mister Truman, #8221; Madeleine said.  #8220;Mom says he'll never be half the president Mr. Roosevelt was, but at least he ended the war. That was last year, though, so it might be someone different now. #8221; The room went silent. I put down my phone. Absolutely nobody wanted to tell her, and can you blame us? Grace was the one who broke the silence.  #8220;Oh, my dear. #8221; She held out her arms, and Madeleine gave her that look little kids give you when they know something's wrong but don't know what yet. Finally she stepped into the offered hug.  #8220;My dear. I'm so sorry. #8221; Madeleine looked up at her. You could tell she didn't want to know, either.  #8220;That was at least ten years ago. #8221; Madeleine shook her head, first slowly, then more frantically.  #8220;No. It was a year ago. I swear it was a year ago! #8221;  #8220;Maybe in the underground, #8221; Dale said.  #8220;Up here . . . Madeleine, I'm sorry. That wasn't ten years ago. It was seventy. #8221; She started bawling. I could hear the words  #8220;just a year #8221; in between sobs. We all just looked at each other. I don't think there's any psychiatrist in the world who could tell you how to approach that information. Grace just held her and stroked her hair, fingers snarling in what I realized were dreads #8212;not locs, but a naturally-tangled mess. I wondered how long she'd still looked human, underground, trying to take care of her own hair without a mom or a mirror or, for that matter, oil or soap. Eventually Dale reached over and pulled Madeleine out of Grace's arms, and she clung onto him like a starfish, sobbing into his shoulder. He just rocked her and let her cry, and let Maxine and Caroline slip into the hug to embrace Madeleine from all around. At some point in the middle of the whole thing, I heard John Denver start playing from the bedroom, and hurried to shut Dale's phone off until I saw the name on the screen. Madeleine was still sobbing, so I picked up.  #8220;It's about damned time you answered your phone, Dale, what the hell is this I found on the table this morning? You sold Nathan to the Wild Ones to get out of the park? Isn't that literally what you screamed at me for doing? What, you were willing to lose your mind over some woman you hired who never gave you a second look, but not someone you spent ten years moping over? Without consulting the family first? All park decisions require a family meeting, Dale, how many times do I have to tell you? #8221; Rick. Leah asked me once if Dale's parents disapproved of our relationship. I told her I didn't think so. That's not the whole story, though #8212;I didn't know her so well back then. They don't disapprove of me, exactly. They don't know what to do with the concept of someone who's okay if he never earns enough money to wipe his ass with ten-dollar bills, but they've never been rude to my face about it. Behind my back, sure, because they worry about keeping up appearances and I'm pretty sure they think I'm only with Dale for the money even though I won't take a dime of it, but at the end of the day I'm still the one sleeping in their son's bed and they've just got to deal with that. I, however, disapprove of *them.* Intensely. It's honestly probably a good thing for Dale's and my relationship that I only met them when I was six months in and already head over heels, and that we saw each other for only two days before they pissed off back to Boise and I didn't have to deal with them again except at Christmas and Easter. Rick's greeting can probably explain why I feel that way.  #8203; Dean is okay, but his mom and dad can seriously go fuck themselves. I just smiled at the phone. I don't think I've ever smiled that way, but I've seen my mom do it, and it's not a smile you should laugh at. Actually, you should probably just head for the door if it's aimed at you.  #8220;Hi, Rick. #8221;  #8220;Nathan! It's good to hear from you, son, I'm sorry. We've had a bit of a morning here #8212; #8221;  #8220;Shut up, Rick. #8221; I've never actually said it before, out of respect for Dale, but I'd had about all I could take already and it wasn't even time for lunch.  #8220;Let's just get this out of the way. First of all, none of this was Dale's idea, it was mine. Second of all, your oldest son almost died last night to make sure your grandkids would never have a fucking albatross around their necks, so show a little respect. Third of all, my name isn't Nathan anymore. And fourth of all, if we're having family meetings about things that affect the park, let's have one right now. How do we think it might affect the future of the park if its fortysomething-year-old manager decided to fuck one of the new hires while, if I remember this timeline right, his wife was recovering from major heart surgery? #8221; Silence. I thought about a near-faceless body a few miles away, wearing a once-white uniform that exposed legs and bust and pulled tight across a stomach that really should've been flat, to be wearing a costume like that. It was probably on the way to rejoining the earth by now, at least a little.  #8220;Actually, while we're on the topic. How do we think it might affect the future of the park if, while fucking the new hire, the manager gets her pregnant, and then has one of the park overseers take her out of the picture to avoid the consequences? #8221; More silence. I could tell he was still there, though. I could practically hear the endless *I'm fucked I'm fucked I'm fucked* reel playing in his head.  #8220;So here's what I think. You're going to tell whoever you have to tell that I'm fine, and Dale and I worked things out, and the kids are safe, and yes it means you'll all have to get off your asses and get a job like the rest of us instead of leeching off Dale for the rest of your lives but you're never going to have to watch the kids ask if they can have lovers or spouses or even friends for fear of losing them to a bunch of evil fairies, and when we call the Fixers to get things straightened for Grace and Robert I'll make sure Laila actually gets a proper burial, which is a hell of a lot more than you were going to do, and maybe they can arrange things so her parents get some closure. Or you can call back when Dale isn't dealing with an incredibly upset little kid, and you can give him a piece of your mind, and before we call the Fixers I'll call the police. The *actual* police. And they can find the body, and do a DNA test, and you can explain why there's a dead woman who's been missing for twenty years who's dumped in the woods with your baby in her belly. Dale might not forgive me, but you know what? I think more than not forgiving me, he wouldn't forgive *you.* And that'd be justice. #8221; Just breathing on the line. Possibly a little bit of crying, too. I'd thought Old Mother was taunting me, when she told me I could see what happened to Laila, but she wasn't. At least, not completely. She was just directing me to look at something different than I thought she was pointing me at.  #8220;I think you have a couple of decisions to make, Rick. And given what I did to Warin last night, I'm pretty sure you going back to the Wild Ones and saying  #8220;they fucked up, we want the park back #8221; is *not* a possible option from among those decisions. #8221; I paused to see if he had anything to add. He didn't. The bullying bluster he started with seemed to have vanished forever.  #8220;I'll give you until this afternoon to make them. #8221;  #8220;Who else knows? #8221; His voice was hoarse. Definitely crying.  #8220;Right now? Anybody with eyes when they all turned back. How far along was she, Rick? Dale said she was turned midseason, but her hire documents said October and I found a blueprint from that November that showed her marked for entry in a building that got repurposed into the hospital. Five months? Six months? Or was it twins? #8221;  #8220;Five. Nathan #8212;whatever you're calling yourself now #8212;please, consider what this would do to the family. #8221;  #8220;That's why I don't have Dale on the line right now. For his sake, not yours. You should've thought of that before you dropped your pants. #8221;  #8220;It was twenty years ago. Please. #8221;  #8220;You know what, Rick? Let's get two things straight. She was in hell for twenty years because of you. She died last night. That's one. And two? Sometimes I'm just a bastard. #8221; I hung up. Then I put Dale's phone on silent and headed back for the living room. Madeleine was mostly calm, lying in Dale's arms and sniffling but also totally worn out. Maxine was picking over her hair and shaking her head.  #8220;Sweetie, it's gonna take a hairdresser to fix this. My hair's too loose for locs, I don't know what to do. #8221; She looked up as I walked back in.  #8220;Na #8212;Michael, do you know anything about locs? #8221;  #8220;Not a clue. I could probably lock mine if I wanted, but I've never been that interested. #8221;  #8220;She's going to need clothes, too, #8221; Anne said. She reached out and stroked Madeleine's cheek.  #8220;You think you'd be okay going out in a little bit to get cleaned up? #8221; Madeleine gave her a little worn-out nod. I untangled her from Dale's arms and picked her up.  #8220;Maybe take a little nap first. There'll be something good to eat when you get up. #8221; She nodded against my shoulder, and I put her down in our bedroom. I guess I'm okay with calling it ours, now. It feels kind of weird, after so long, but not bad. A lot of plans got laid while I was busy threatening Rick, apparently. Caroline and Oliver wanted to take Grace and Robert for something slightly less mid-1960s to wear. Leah was in desperate need of a haircut, and Darius offered to accompany her in case of any weird still-transitioning-to-human lapses. Dale, of course, had to call the Fixers. Anne already wanted to take Madeleine for clothes, but as soon as her hair came into question Maxine came into the picture with a phone number for her own stylist, who she swore knew everything in the universe about braids and locs. And then Mitchell brought up a good point: Somebody, and since he was the only one left he was nominated, had to go let the horses off the stagecoach. He offered to take something to cover Laila with, too. I was pretty sure Rick was going to take my offer, which meant there was no worry about leaving something incriminating, so I found a blanket in the linen closet and asked if he'd lay her out on it. It didn't have to be fancy #8212;she just deserved better than laying on the ground mostly naked. We agreed to reconvene for one last all-crew dinner around five. We'd still be in touch after that, of course, and there'd probably be big get-togethers, but they wouldn't be done around our job anymore. It was a weird feeling. I had most of a loaf of bread in the freezer, already fried into French toast and waiting for a microwave. It's not gourmet cuisine, but when you only have ten minutes to eat, it's useful. I pulled it out to get everyone fed. Somewhere toward the end of breakfast Madeleine padded back out, and I plated up a slice for her before sending her out with the girls. Dale made me sit down and have another glass of water while he loaded the dishwasher once we got everyone out the door. He spent most of the time on the phone with somebody named Philip. When the call was done he sat down at the table.  #8220;I have to tell you something. I probably should've waited to talk to you to decide this, but I didn't feel like I could. Wait, I mean."  #8220;Okay. #8221; I took a couple of deep breaths so I wouldn't lose my breakfast all over the table.  #8220;I'm adopting Madeleine. #8221; I just stared at him.  #8220;I thought you didn't want kids. #8221;  #8220;I didn't feel like I could have kids. There's a difference. #8221; He looked down at his hands, then back up at me.  #8220;I get it, if that's a dealbreaker for you. But I didn't feel like I could just leave her hanging out in the wind. And here's the weird part, apparently her mom worked with Grace before she got married, and they stayed friends. So it's not the same, at all, but she'll still be in touch with someone she knew back then. #8221;  #8220;Are you kidding me? I always wanted kids. I just figured, you know, the way things were before I got on the coach, I'd never be able to adopt. #8221; He took my hand. I yawned. Adrenaline crash is a real bitch like that. We were napping when Caroline and Oliver got back with Grace and Robert. Robert had gone from a sport coat and slacks to a short-sleeved shirt and slacks, but Grace actually picked out something new, and it looked great. I checked my messages and found one from Mitchell, asking if he should bring anything to dinner since it was so last-minute. I turned to Dale.  #8220;I don't even know what I'm making. #8221; Grace cut in before Dale could answer.  #8220;If it wouldn't be too much trouble. It has been, according to Caroline, fifty-eight years since I last had a pot pie casserole. #8221; I didn't want to say it, but I had to.  #8220;I don't know how to make puff pastry. Every time I try it collapses. #8221;  #8220;I'd be happy to share my recipe. #8221; I gave her probably my first real actual smile of the day.  #8220;That'd be awesome, I don't have any family recipes. #8221; Grace was horrified at my lack of bread flour, but we managed to make all-purpose work, and then she insisted I put the dough in the freezer. I tried not to look at her like she'd lost her mind, but I don't think it worked very well.  #8220;If your pastry collapses, freezing it will allow it to steam when it bakes, and the steam will force it to rise. #8221; I don't think she'd ever heard anybody say a great cooking tip was the shit before, but she figured out what it meant pretty quickly. Probably because I was so fucking excited to finally see a puff pastry work. She looked exhausted, which I guessed was probably par for the course after turning back and then having to spend a day shopping, so I suggested she and Robert take the bedroom for awhile. There's a spare room, and beds, but they're literally for Dale's nieces and nephews. At least in the master bedroom they could spend some time holding each other, even if it wasn't perfect privacy. Speaking from experience, that's one of the best parts of being turned back. Dinner was great. At some point in the middle of it Philip showed up. He was, without question, the most generic-looking white man I've ever seen, and I kind of had the feeling that was on purpose. I sort of suspect you don't work as a Fixer if you look in any way even remotely memorable. He provided Grace and Robert with papers #8212;perfectly real and valid, he told them, even the Social Security numbers #8212;and Dale with a packet for Madeleine and a second packet for long-term employees who are going to have a very hard time explaining what they did with the last few years of their lives otherwise. Then he pulled me aside and I got a packet of my own. Birth certificate, driver's license, Social Security card, all with my new name. Seeing it written out suddenly pinged something in my head, and I stuck it back into the living room from the mudroom.  #8220;Hey, Leah? #8221; She had to stop and swallow probably the biggest bite of pot pie I've ever seen in my life. It was actually pretty funny, even though I knew she was probably just enjoying being able to eat real food with actual seasoning again.  #8220;Yeah? #8221;  #8220;You gave me your last name. #8221; She grinned at me.  #8220;Yeah, I've kind of always wanted a brother. And my parents aren't around anymore to say you weren't actually adopted, so, you know. #8221; I ducked back into the mudroom before I could start crying. I haven't had a family in fifteen years. Getting a sister and a prospective daughter in about six hours is a lot. Philip offered me a Kleenex. Somehow I get the impression he deals with this on a regular basis. It's night now. The dishwasher's running, Grace and Robert are in our room, and Madeleine's tucked in down the hall. The girls are staying with Leah tonight, but tomorrow I'll be going back over to stay for at least a couple of weeks #8212;to help her readjust, and also to give Dale just a little bit of space to get used to the new normal. He hasn't been allowed to think about what he might want to do with his life since he was nineteen, and I'm definitely not running off or going radio silent, but having a little quiet time at night to consider the possibilities is probably going to be good for him. In the morning, Grace and Robert have a flight to catch #8212;I'm not exactly sure where they're going because the location is secret, but they'll be spending some time with the Fixers, learning about stuff like, you know, the internet. And credit cards. I thought they might want to go stay with Dale's family afterward, but Grace very firmly stated her intention of coming right back here and getting  #8220;a little bungalow #8221; in town, so I guess I've got parents now, too. This is probably the last time you guys will hear from me. I'm not really the blogging type, and I only started this to get some advice #8212;and make a record, I guess, of something so weird it can't be described. And anyway I'm going to be busy as hell #8212;with Dale, with Madeleine, with Leah, and after a phone call I got this afternoon from Betty, with school. I'm not entirely sure I still want to be a teacher, not knowing more about myself than I did when the summer began, but I can get core classes out of the way while I make up my mind. And if I'm doing it on Rick's hush money, that's okay #8212;at least Laila is rid of his bullshit, even if I wish it'd happened differently. I didn't expect it to end this way at all when I first talked to you guys. But here we are #8212;as happy an ending as we can have, all things considered, I guess. Not perfect, of course; it's going to be a bumpy road for Grace and Robert and Madeleine, at least for awhile. But what life doesn't have those? We're going to be okay. And that's just fine by me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. And thank you for sticking with me through it all. I don #8217;t think we #8217;ll ever know for sure. But I #8217;m pretty sure he was still hanging around the park #8212;either in the underground but keeping an eye on things, or actually staying just out of sight. If I had to guess, when the deal was offered he saw it as a chance to give us both one last big  #8220;fuck you, #8221; so he took my face, which is absolutely creepy to think about by the way, to attack Dale and then got the meeting plans off the last text I sent. Then he took Dale #8217;s face and took his place on the ride. I might #8217;ve noticed if I #8217;d still had my contacts in, but I didn #8217;t, and he didn #8217;t talk until the end. Definitely helped him out that dale doesn #8217;t show his teeth when he smiles usually, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sailor Moon.  #8203; When we learn about the Moon Kingdom in Silver Millennium, we're told it's a utopia. AND YET, the princess is guarded by four child soldiers, isn't permitted to leave the palace because it's too dangerous, and although she sneaks out and has a dalliance with a prince from Earth, there's absolutely zero evidence that said prince's people know that when they stage an invasion of the Moon Kingdom and just straight up slaughter everybody.  #8203; Likewise:  #8203; in Crystal Tokyo, nobody believes Chibi-Usa is actually Usagi's daughter, on the basis that she "doesn't look like her parents." But there's absolutely zero reason for Usagi to lie about Chibi-Usa being her child, on top of which, how many kids are there out there who "don't look like their parents" because they took after somebody further back down the line or simply got a weird blend of traits? And wouldn't it make more sense, if you're assuming she's not a legitimate heir, to assume she's not MAMORU'S child? It's a lot easier to fake a dad than a mom.  #8203; Further: there's zero reason Sailor Pluto should have to be "unknowable." (A rule that eventually just disappears anyway, for absolutely zero stated reason.) Same with Saturn. (Also a rule that eventually just disappears for absolutely zero stated reason.) Like, okay, with Saturn you have the argument of "she must never be awakened" okay fine, her role until Usagi comes along and fucks with the order of the universe is simply to destroy said universe upon awakening, I'll agree she shouldn't be awakened, but wouldn't you think it might be helpful to the other Senshi to *know she fucking exists* so they don't accidentally awaken her??? But with Pluto literally the only reason you can't know she exists is basically so Queen Serenity can't be accused of child abuse.  #8203; I fuckin' love this show, but damn does it have more holes in it than a good piece of Swiss.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver: The Director's Commentary</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-08 11:56:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>So if you, like me, are the kind of person who watches every single featurette on the DVD and dislikes digital downloads specifically because *where are my special features*, this post is for you. If you are the kind of person who could give two shits about the behind-the-scenes stuff, you're not going to miss anything important here.  #8203; I just know a ton of people said they didn't know what they'd do with their time with Stagecoach over, and who also want me to port this over to the AO3. Here's the thing: I just wrote 85 000 words in fifty days. That's basically doing your daily requirement for NaNoWriMo (almost) every day *for two months.* (While working full-time in the middle of a pandemic!) There wasn't much time for editing or anything like that, so it'll be getting ported, but I'll also be cleaning it up a bit while it makes the move.  #8203; So while you're waiting on that, have a wind-down: stuff that didn't make the cut, stuff that got abandoned when the plot just fucked off to Narnia without me, stuff that'll be going back in as it's ported, all that kind of fun shit.  #8203; \--Dale pulled an Elsa on me very early in the writing. He was originally supposed to be unsympathetic, die at the end, and he and Nathan were only going to reconcile in their final scene together--with said reconciliation mostly being Nathan finally being able to let go of his anger, not regretting Dale's death. When I first conceived the scene in the Whacky Shack (which was only one or two parts in), he was in the place Warin would end up filling. The dialogue "would you have forgiven me, if we'd both gotten through tonight?" "Yes." "Then it's okay" popped into my head as I was falling asleep, broke my heart, and when I woke up I knew I had to keep him alive.  #8203; \--There was a scene I never finished writing because I couldn't find a spot to make it fit, but every time I watched somebody ranking on Mitchell I thought of it and felt like I just had to cram it in somewhere. (Which is probably at least 50% of why I'm making this post.) In the couple of weeks before Stagecoach starts, Mitchell discovers Nathan's extreme touch-starvation from, you know, being completely isolated for ten years, and spends time on the sofa basically just spooning him with all their skin covered until Nathan can handle having his hands held, and then just keeps on going barehanded, no socks, short-sleeved, until Nathan doesn't jump like he's been electrocuted at every incidental bump.  #8203; \--The original plan was for the story to take place over the course of eight weeks rather than six months, and during that time Nathan was going to stay with most of the crew. Him slowly accumulating a wardrobe of various pieces he borrowed (and then never returned) was supposed to be a running gag, including, of course, the inevitable commentary on him getting into Oliver's jeans.  #8203; \--I spent two weeks trying to find a place for the chapter opener "Before I tell you what happened last night, I want you to know there is no possible way for you to judge me harder than I'm judging myself. But it's been ten years and I'm a hedonist and there was cake." Part of the line got recycled into the story, but it was originally supposed to refer to Nathan impulsively sleeping with Dale and then trying to hide it from the crew.  #8203; \--For about thirty seconds flat, the woman in the crossed-out photos was supposed to be Leah's grandmother. I decided I didn't like it and axed it. (Too late to axe the photo itself, of course.)  #8203; \--The body Oliver spots in the old theatre was supposed to be Robert's. I briefly played around with the idea that becoming a pretender would eventually result in you losing your own (mortal, human-looking) body and basically growing a new one--hence the turning process taking so long. Eventually I decided on the body and the apparition Nathan sees (which would originally have been Grace) being some kind of creature that basically hangs around the Wild Ones and feeds on their detritus, because it was too late to write the body out. Only after I finished the whole damn story did I realize I had a third and better option, which is the one I'll be taking in the port.  #8203; \--For a brief time, Leah was going to move into Warin's nest without making the conscious decision to do so, and attempts to return her to her more human quarters would be unsuccessful.  #8203; \--I played with the idea of Oliver being bisexual and Nathan just totally missing every single one of the signs because he was too freaked out at the idea of being interested in a straight boy. He would have ended up coming out naturally during a discussion in which Nathan mentioned Dale's high school girlfriend.  #8203; \--who was supposed to be Vinnie. And actually that was never supposed to be cut, I just kind of . . . forgot to put it in. (Whoops.)  #8203; \--Nathan confronting Rick changed four times, and included Dale telling his dad off, Nathan just straight-up telling Rick to go fuck himself and hanging up, and Nathan having the conversation in the living room, on speakerphone, before asking Rick how many witnesses he could get rid of.  #8203; \--Nathan almost getting tased was originally Nathan almost getting shot. I asked a Black friend if she'd mind being a sensitivity reader for the scene and she basically axed it on the spot. I reworked it and made the crazy lady just a tad bit more of a Karen to make it work. I don't regret the choice to do something less loaded, but I do miss the conversation Dale was supposed to have with the Karen (which included him confronting the lady about being afraid of Nathan's prop gun but not Mitchell's and also accidentally referring to Nathan as his fiance).  #8203; \--In the last chapter, Grace was supposed to make a disapproving noise at Dale and Nathan kissing, only for Nathan to ask if the problem was them being a couple or being a *mixed* couple and Grace to say "Please, dear, I work in the theatre. I have no problem with either Negros or homosexuals. But that haircut is a disgrace," clearly referring to Dale. I couldn't make it fit no matter what I did, sad to say. (I literally gave a trigger warning for it, even!)  #8203; \--At one point, there was a scene with Nathan running into his family. He was supposed to hear his father's voice, look up, and see a little girl who was pretty clearly his sister's kid running up to him for a photo, only to realize his father either didn't recognize him, or was choosing to pretend he didn't.  #8203; \--The concept of the park-within-a-park originally also had a section in horror that included an abandoned half of the haunted hospital and a second breakroom, along with some half-finished construction on the part of the arcade building that Dale labeled "hallway to hell" on the new blueprints.  #8203; \--The Dale reveal in the last chapter was originally in the living room and involved him walking in the front door, being confronted by Mitchell and Oliver, and reaching over his head to grab the horseshoe over the door. I was at work and the line about Nathan trying to shoot a gun using the gunsight instead of the trigger popped into my head, and I started laughing so hard two people asked me if I was okay. I immediately decided to change the scene.  #8203; \--Originally, the phrase Nathan kept using as a signoff for his more dickish moments was going to be "what can I say, I bite when I'm provoked," and its final use would have been explaining why Warin didn't kiss him by force in the Whacky Shack.  #8203;  #8203; Enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My gaming laptop's screen is separating. Please help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 02:40:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>So first things first: I know a bunch of people are going to say "the best bet is to get a desktop instead." This is deeply impractical for me, for a range of reasons including but not limited to "I have to carry this thing to anime conventions" and "I live in a desert and the AC in our house is spotty so I have to go where the cool air is." I'm well aware I'd probably get better performance out of a desktop. I just need to fix what I have.  #8203; I have an Acer Nitro 5, about three years old. It's all original hardware except the keyboard, which had to be replaced. (Worth noting: this is probably a me problem, not a laptop problem. Every laptop I've ever owned has needed a keyboard replacement at some point because apparently I type too hard or something.) So far, so good.  #8203; A couple of weeks ago, the screen hinge started making this awful plastic-grating noise when I tried to open it. Eventually the hinge itself started to pop apart along the seam that holds the front and back of the screen together. I discovered the whole thing snaps together like Legos, so I snapped it together, threw a little strip of electrical tape on it for some added support, and called it good. And so it was, for like a whole week.  #8203; Now the hinge on both sides is separating. The right side (the first one to go) won't snap back together anymore. The separation is creeping along the bottom side of the screen, and while at this point it's still snapping back together I think it's just a matter of time before that goes, too. I have to open the screen by holding onto the hinges to keep it together, and attempts to open it from the top (you know, the way you normally would) literally pop it apart down the sides. The screen is still working, but its frame is basically *literally* disintegrating at the seams.  #8203; Is there a simple way to fix this? Should I take it to a specialist for a screen replacement? Or, given the age of the machine, should I just write down my mod lists and pony up for a new one?</TEXT>

I actually didn #8217;t think about it at the time, but Maxine pointed out I saw him raise the lap bar with both hands. Dale #8217;s wrist was broken. There #8217;s no way he was raising anything with both hands. It had to be someone else, but I missed it.</TEXT>

If he's heavier-set and still has a square jaw, he has one *hell* of a strong bone structure. What I find hilarious is that it seems like absolutely nobody has noticed Dale and Warin have near-identical descriptions, except for the cleft lip and the weight. And yesssssssss. I'm actively trying to break out of the whole "just default assuming characters are white" thing, so casting them all and trying to imagine them different ways was super-fun. ^^;;;;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having issues with my game display, can anyone help? (Probably not a mod issue.)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-30 10:51:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>EDIT: my roommate took a look at it. Apparently the resolution tried to set itself too low when the graphics settings shat themselves. I messed with it for almost two hours and failed. It took him five minutes to fix it.  #8203; This is why it's both good, and endlessly embarrassing, to live with an IT professional.  #8203; Okay, so, I had to restart my computer because sometimes Conquest gets fucky and freezes my game. This is a known issue, I normally have a pretty good workaround for it, occasionally it just still decides it needs to be a dick to me so I have to restart the computer and then reenter the game. It's an old mod, it doesn't always play nicely with new updates. This is old news. MOVING ON.  #8203; When I got everything restarted and tried to reopen the game, it pulled up this little gray window that said something like "Fallout 4 is measuring your monitor settings" or something like that. Then it told me my game display had been set to low quality. I normally run with medium, so I kind of sat there going " . . . um?" But okay, sure, so the game continues to open as it normally does. I briefly windows-key out of there to answer a message. I come back, and the screen is . . . okay, the easiest way I can explain this is, imagine holding a piece of printer paper up to your monitor, with one corner aligned with the top left of your screen. (Or actually do it if you're that kind of visual, I don't care.) Everything within the bounds of the printer paper is what's showing on my screen. Everything outside that *should* be showing, but isn't--it's like the game has been cropped and enlarged, and now I can't see probably a quarter of the screen at the top and side. (And what's left is very low quality. Not like FO4-low-quality, either. Like "some games made in 1994 had better quality than this" low quality.)  #8203; So far, here's what I've tested and determined:  #8203; \--The problem only occurs if I hotkey out and come back, but it ALWAYS occurs if I hotkey out and come back. \--Occasionally, the opening screens are getting stuck while everything continues loading in the background. I've had this problem before and the only way to fix it and let the images "catch up" is by hotkeying out. (You can see where this is a problem.) \--Switching back to medium doesn't fix it. Neither does switching to high. \--I've played with a few of the other settings, like "let's go for medium graphics but low antialiasing" and "let's turn off godrays," and that doesn't help either. \--All of my screen's regular default settings are the way they're supposed to be. \--My drivers are up to date. \--Restarting the computer again did not help. \--I've removed a couple of mods, but none that should be affecting resolution (one non-functional radio mod, one non-functional "here is a new location . . . that you will NEVER FIND" mod, and for some reason I had three scrapping mods instead of, you know, one, so two of them went away).  #8203;  #8203; I have been fighting with this for ALMOST TWO HOURS. How do I fix it?!  #8203;  #8203; EDIT: a picture is worth a thousand words, so here. This is what the front loading screen, the one where you can pick your toon or add mods or CC content or continue your game, looks like after I hotkey out.

    <TEXT>Fallout 4, PC: Hotel Wasteland. I've offered three levels of suggestion: "this is the basic idea that requires nothing else in order to function," "hey you like math more than me this would be cool," and "ah, I see you have nothing else to do for a couple of weeks, would you like to be as super-ultra-mega-deluxe nitpicky about immersion as I am?" *PLEASE* understand that last category is more or less a pipe dream--I seriously doubt anybody would actually want to do it, even if I'd literally pay money (not caps, either) to be able to use it--and don't take it too seriously. Unless, you know. You're bored as hell in quarantine and want A Whole Damn Project right now.  #8203; BARE MINIMUM: a bed, mattress, or sleeping bag (maybe all three as options?) that are perpetually marked as owned. They don't count toward your bed count in your settlement, but once every 24 hours a check is run and for each bed you have a flat chance (maybe 25-50%) of ten caps being passively deposited into the workshop. This chance is the same per bed--so if you have one bed you have a 25% chance, but if you have five beds then you have a 25% chance, five times (as opposed to a 125% chance). Somebody way better at math than me might choose to give this diminishing returns, so you don't have, you know, a 250-bed hotel down in Murkwater, but that's totally just "if you're a math nerd and feel like doing it."  #8203; THIS WOULD BE COOL: tie the once-daily check to the other amenities in the settlement. So say your base chance is 20%--if you have a tier one merchant, your chance is now 22.5%. If you have six tier one merchants, it's now 35%. A tier two merchant? You've gone from 20% to 25%, a tier three merchant from 20% to 27.5%, and so on, until your max possible is a 65% chance (20% base + 7.5% per tier three shop for all six shops). To get more elaborate, you could add another check on some of the other vanilla amenities like the barber, surgery, and caravan options. Basically--just like Diamond City and Goodneighbor have shops, food, water, chems, etc. that would make them desirable locations to travel to, if you've built yourself a nice big capital up in Sanctuary, people might want to go there just as much as they would to Diamond City, so it makes sense to have a greater chance of lodgers there.  #8203; IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A WHOLE DAMN PROJECT OUT OF IT: All of the above *plus* occasional NPCs who are not regular settlers but are named "boarder" or "lodger" or something similar, who may sandbox near the rentable beds. A further variable in which your population size and/or the type of bed offered determines the number of caps per bed you may earn (perhaps a fully-tricked-out settlement with max settlers and off-the-floor beds earns 15 caps per night, while a lonely sleeping bag down in Somerville Place nets you three caps). Obligatory "ugly hotel bedspread" beds. A new job position as desk or hotel clerk. (Dialogue for this could be easily obtained by taking Claire's and Tony's lines and running them through a sound program to change the voices, if you wanted to get *that* elaborate.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fallout 4, PC: Hotel Wasteland. I've offered three levels of suggestion: "this is the basic idea that requires nothing else in order to function," "hey you can do math better than me this would be cool," and "ah, I see you have nothing else to do for a couple of weeks, would you like to be as super-ultra-mega-deluxe nitpicky about immersion as I am?" *PLEASE* understand that last category is more or less a pipe dream--I seriously doubt anybody would actually want to do it, even if I'd literally pay money (not caps, either) to be able to use it--and don't take it too seriously. Unless, you know. You're bored as hell in quarantine and want A Whole Damn Project right now.  #8203;  #8203; BARE MINIMUM: a bed, mattress, or sleeping bag (maybe all three as options?) that are perpetually marked as owned. They don't count toward your bed count in your settlement, but once every 24 hours a check is run and for each bed you have a flat chance (maybe 25-50%) of ten caps being passively deposited into the workshop. This chance is the same per bed--so if you have one bed you have a 25% chance, but if you have five beds then you have a 25% chance, five times (as opposed to a 125% chance).

    <TEXT>Not at all. The game's thesis is "what makes you human?" We can see this clearly in Nick and Curie, and also in random encounters like the two raiders with the synth--he just wants to go to Bunker Hill and they want to murder him. What makes a monster, and what makes a man? Is slavery justified?  #8203; If you choose to end with the Institute, then you have chosen to say "slavery is okay, liberty is a joke, and we should go back to the wildly-corrupted world from before the bombs." Given that the game is set in Boston, and there are frequent references to its history as the birthplace of the modern United States, I'd say that arguing "the ideals of independence and liberty are bad" is *not* what the game is going for.  #8203; It also runs counter to the entire series. The goal is to find hope for humanity. Synths, at least Gen Three synths, can be perfectly human, and we see this in non-Institute endings when  gt;!synth child Shaun! lt; is sent back with you. But the people who enslave and subjugate them? No. They cannot and will not accept that they could ever be wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Synths are shown to have human intelligence and emotions. We see them get married, have fun, cry, and even die. When synth!Curie and Nick are injured, you use Stimpaks for them, not robot repair kits. Synths who #8217;ve escaped the Institute are shown to be fearful and timid and express a great deal of trauma. Literally the entire point of Automatron is  #8220;when you start choosing who is and isn #8217;t human, you give yourself a pass to murder with no harm to your conscience. #8221; This is shown not only by its main storyline #8212;in which we see that robobrains are made from people who were declared criminal or unstable (meaning WHAT? How many innocent Chinese-Americans do you reckon became robobrains?) and then experimented on and murdered #8212;but also in a shot from the main dungeon that any Jew will recognize: an oven for the mass disposal of human remains. The parallel there is QUITE clear. Gen three synths are people and the game couldn #8217;t make this clearer if it had a neon sign.  #8220;Reducing their programming #8221; would be tantamount to murder. Not that the Institute seems to mind, since they #8217;ve also decided aboveground humans  #8220;aren #8217;t really people #8221; and keep sending gen ones to murder my farmers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As for your question about standard robots: I would say that depends on whether those robots have a degree of sentience. The little robots you can build after finishing Automatron are basically no more than appliances. They don #8217;t have personalities and can only do what you program them to do. Codsworth, however, is literally advertised as having  #8220;human empathy #8221; if you look at the Mister Handy billboards downtown. We see this in him, along with the ability to make his own decisions (he can decide of his own will not to travel with you if your affinity drops too low). He, and robots like him, should certainly be granted some kind of rights, as they have sentient ability.</TEXT>

FO4 reminds me a little of Mystic Quest. It feels kind of like it #8217;s designed to ease you into PC gaming (or at least for me as a PC player it does, ymmv on other platforms).

    <TEXT>So I wanted to get rid of a bunch of CC stuff I don't actually use and don't want. Followed some instructions on . . . I think it was the Nexus forums? Some gaming forum, anyway, I got there via Google. They said to go into my game's data folder, look for files that contained "CC" at the beginning, and delete them.  #8203; So far, so good. Opened my test file, which is saved in the Vault right at the beginning before all your quests load. Went into the wasteland, discovered one of the quests I wanted rid of didn't actually delete. Closed everything back out, went back into files, deleted what I thought was the last of the CC files.  #8203; Now the game crashes on startup. Can't even get to the load screen to open my test file.  #8203; *Fine,* Bethesda, you win. I grab the files back out of my recycle bin and toss them back into the folder I deleted them from.  #8203; . . . . it's still crashing on startup.  #8203; So now what do I do? Delete the whole game and redownload? I have a ton of mods, is that going to fuck with redownloading it? Is there a fix? Send help, I'm not panicking but I have *no* idea what to do next.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, this is just weird. I had to turn down an order around an hour to close last night because I was low on nacho cheese (it was 20 double-stacks), but the dude just ordered a couple twelve-packs instead and it was fine. The only time I #8217;ve ever turned down an order for being too big too close to close was eight minutes to close and they wanted 16 chalupas. I only had two available and I wasn #8217;t firing my fryer back up and dirtying my entire fry station again. The most common problem that late would be a shortage on beef. And it sounds like you were more than accommodating if that were indeed the issue. I #8217;d call the manager first, and only if you get no help there should you call the 1-800. The reason I say this is, if it #8217;s one or two shitty employees, the manager can deal with it. But if you call 1-800, everybody up the chain of command sees it. I #8217;ve even seen VP email responses to 1-800 calls. When that happens, good employees who are totally innocent and may not even know there #8217;s a problem can get in trouble. (I #8217;ve been heavily questioned for theft because of a 1-800 call. The incident happened ON A DAY I WASN #8217;T WORKING.) Don #8217;t let it slide, though.

    <TEXT>The bottles are glass. The packets are soft metal. The metal leaches into the sauce. If you think I #8217;m making this up, go grab your soft drink of choice in a plastic bottle and also an aluminum can. Taste both, with a sip of water between. You #8217;ll find they taste different. If you live in a place where you can get said soft drink in glass as well, add it to the lineup. Pepsi Throwback and Mexican Pepsi have the exact same recipe, but taste WILDLY different. The glass bottles are better for you. Go for those.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Speaking as the person who does all the Grubhub/Postmates/UberEats checking at my store, I assure you delivery gets the same QC. However, we also have to sandwich it in between other orders, as drivers can show up anywhere from five minutes to three hours after the order appears. (Yes, I #8217;m serious. I once got an order around 10pm for which the driver finally showed up at 1:30 and couldn #8217;t understand why, half an hour after we closed, we couldn #8217;t remake the order.) And complicated orders can make things worse, especially because people are fucking stupid and we #8217;ve actually gotten BUSIER since COVID started, so we #8217;re also working with a previously-unseen level of business. My store is doing about 120% the amount of business we were this time last year. You #8217;re really better off just ordering mobile or coming through drivethru yourself. Especially because you have no idea where that delivery driver #8217;s been (have they visited a COVID-positive house? Who the fuck knows?), and your food can sit, getting gross, for AGES before it gets picked up.</TEXT>

Ask if they can fry you a single Mexican Pizza shell in the chalupa basket. 4) Now ask them to make a Taco Supreme out of it. I'm a shift lead. My mom asked me a few years ago to try to recreate the TacoLite and said while it's not 100% the same, it's pretty damned close. I really wish they'd put such a thing on the menu.

My manager came in the back and went "shut it all down. All of it. Throw everything out." Of course it was like 2pm and we were like "whut" and he went "shut it all down." Turns out our green onions were part of one of the affected batches and he was told by the way-high-ups to treat the entire line as though it were contaminated.

    <TEXT>Posted this before, but hoping it gets traction. Offering three levels of difficulty, any of which would be totally bomb. And obviously if you decide to pick it up you can pick or choose whatever the hell you want to from any of these categories.  #8203; I fully support the concept of releasing this mod on the Nexus and/or bethnet for other players, as well.  #8203; Requesting, for Fallout 4 PC, HOTEL WASTELAND.  #8203; SIMPLE MINIMUM: a bed you can build that does not count toward your settlement minimum. Once per in-game day, the game runs a check and you can potentially earn caps per bed or sleeping bag placed. (After all . . . not every hotel is maxed out every night, right?) This would run on a flat percentage--no matter what you do, you only have X% chance of earning that money, and and X will not change. The check *does* rely on you having a minimum number of beds--if you have five settlers, three beds, and two hotel beds, too bad. No caps. You need five beds *plus* your hotel beds to make bank.  #8203; A BIT MORE COMPLICATED: like above, but X CAN change. Just like you'd probably rather stay in a five-star hotel in Manhattan than a shady one just off the freeway in Bumfuck, Nebraska, the number of amenities in your settlement increases the odds you'll get lodgers. (This mostly means vendors, but setting down a caravan trading post, barber, surgery chair, or exercise equipment could also help.) And, of course, a nice fancy trading mall made of all T3 or T4 vendors is going to be worth more of a percentage increase than a bunch of T1 vendors.  #8203; YOU'RE GOING CRAZY IN QUARANTINE, AND WANT A FULL-ON MONTHLONG PROJECT: all of that. *But wait, there's more!* Add a "desk clerk" job for one of your settlers, and the number of caps you earn increases by a set amount (say you normally earn five caps per bed; with a desk clerk, it's seven). Multiple kinds of beds offer greater immersion: perhaps you have a hotel with ten proper off-the-floor beds in Sanctuary, pulling in 15 caps each per night, but just a lonely little three-caps-a-night sleeping bag in Somerville Place for weary travelers fortunate enough to have somehow survived the Glowing Sea. You may spot random settlers labeled as "lodger" sandboxing near your rentable beds.  #8203; I am not joking when I say I would pay actual money for this. I really want a hotel in County Crossing, dammit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so before anybody reads the first line and goes to yell about how I'm wrong, I'll tell you what I think I found and then how I tested it before hopping over here.  #8203; So tonight at work, this song popped up on my phone while I was doing dishes. There's a rather distinct music sample in the chorus: people who watch old TV may recognize it as part of the theme to The Munsters.  #8203; I've been listening to this song for \~5 years. (This and Centuries were actually my introduction to FOB.) Do I know all the words? HELL no, and that's true of basically every FOB song I like, because Patrick Stump has this very distinctive way of breaking up his words in unusual places so you really have to listen closely or get written lyrics. What that means for me, though, is that I have to listen to cadence and rhythm, rather than lyrics, and when there are readily-recognizable words, they stick out.  #8203; So in the whole time I've known the song, it's said "I can move mountains, I can work a miracle, work a miracle, oh-oh, \[I'll\] keep you like an oath" and then the Munsters sample kicks in. Very distinctive, especially if you know The Munsters. (Look, it's a great show, I'm just saying a line as metal as "I'll keep you like an oath" being followed up by *The Munsters* is . . . . unexpected.) I threw the "I'll" in brackets because I can hear it with my REALLY GOOD headphones but not my shitty $5 work earbuds, so for others who may be working on budget earphones here I'm making the note that it is *not* easy to hear. MOVING ON.  #8203; So tonight, I'm listening, and after "keep you like an oath" someone who is not Patrick Stump starts singing, and with each word very carefully separated and staccato, says "may nothing but death--do--us--part." The fact it's not Patrick doesn't trip me out--there are four members, occasionally Pete Wentz helps out on vocals, there are plenty of logical reasons to have a second singer on a line that ever-so-slightly overlaps the previous line--but that line has never been there before. And it feels very out of place, adding a whole new rhythm pattern between "keep you like an oath" and the Munsters sample for all of about three seconds.  #8203; So now the #1 protest I hear whenever someone brings up a lyrics Mandela (and indeed I've been the person making this protest): "There are different versions!" You are 10000% correct, go enjoy a cookie. Make it two. Knowing this is why I proceeded to track down the music video version, official album version, clean edit version, somebody's random-ass lyrics video, and also checked Wikipedia to make sure there was no radio edit. All of these include the lyric. (I didn't look for a live version because I've never heard a live version.)  #8203; Am I losing my mind? Can anyone confirm?</TEXT>

(To wit: I dreamed about being in the hospital dying because my head had been crushed. Later that day I was almost hit by a speeding snowplow with its blade raised, which, had it hit me, would have crushed my head. My range of vision was limited at the time and the area was too noisy to hear the plow #8212;without the dream putting me on edge, I would #8217;ve died.)

    <TEXT>Maybe because your concept of  #8220;advance #8221; is very Eurocentric. It #8217;s like people who say the Aztecs weren #8217;t advanced because they didn #8217;t invent wheels. THEY LIVED ON SWAMP. Where would they USE wheels? Meanwhile, they had a crop-growing structure that was so insanely advanced it was self-sustaining and came without most of the problems of  #8220;advanced #8221; European farming. Look up something called chinampas. What I know without proof is 90% of the people commenting on this post never got more than a tenth-grade education and it shows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can absolutely just live the morals of Judaism. I'm not an atheist (certain restrictions apply--we'll come back to that), but there's a quote that appears in my temple's prayerbook (I forget which part of the Torah it's from and it doesn't really matter in this context): "It is better that you should forget Me and hold fast to my Torah, than that you should forget my Torah and hold fast to Me." (I should note, since you likely do not speak Hebrew, that "Torah" literally means "law." If you've read an English translation of the Bible and you're familiar with Jesus saying "the Law and the Prophets," he's referring to the Torah and the Nevi'im, which are the first two-thirds of the Tanakh.) In other words: if you remember to care for the sick and vulnerable, to be kind to those who are not like you, to avoid greed and spite, to stand up for truth and justice, and you do it all while not believing in G-d at all, that is *far, far better* than that you should say "I love G-d!" while turning your back on the vulnerable, seeking only to enrich yourself, and exploiting those around you. We could have an entire long discussion about whether those words were actually spoken by G-d or if they were written by man, but the point remains that they are explicit within a sacred text: the belief in G-d is *entirely irrelevant* to being a good Jew. Another Jewish tale that's relevant here is a famous midrash (a kind of story intended for teaching, similar to a parable). It goes like this: two rabbis sit up all night poring over Tanakh and Talmud, arguing round and round and round. They're both very learned men, and each quotes responsa and rabbis and sages in his argument.  #8203; Eventually, they manage to definitively disprove the existence of G-d. Having settled that question, one of them looks at the clock and announces he has to go bathe so he can go to morning prayers. "What!" says the other rabbi. "But haven't we, literally *just now*, completely proved that there can be no G-d?" "Why, yes," says the rabbi who intends to go pray. "But what has that got to do with anything?" In other words: being a good Jew requires that he be thankful for what he has (most daily Jewish prayers are thanks and blessings). So what if he's praying to nothing? He's still taking stock of the wonders of his life and being grateful for things like sun and rain to sustain him and the wonderful intricacies of the body that allow him to live, and that's the important part. Following Torah is more important than believing in G-d or, indeed, whether or not G-d even exists. And finally, to wrap up: I told you I'm not an atheist (some restrictions apply). It may surprise you to know that what I'm about to tell you can, in fact, be backed up perfectly with evidence from the Tanakh, and that strictly speaking, while it's wildly unorthodox it is not inconsistent at all with Jewish law and teaching.  #8203; I actually believe we exist within a computer simulation. Not as in "oh no we're slaves in the matrix," but as in "ah, we are a very elaborate game of SimCity." G-d is a computer programmer. G-d knows everything because they designed the program, so anything potentially unknowable to G-d just . . . isn't in there. (Perhaps, for example, time travel is 10000% possible in the world that created us! But the programmer doesn't know how to execute it, so it's just not possible in our world.) G-d is all-powerful because theirs are the fingers on the keyboard--anything they can't actually execute in a program just doesn't exist in our world. It's entirely possible that G-d is only a terrible and all-powerful being *to us* and that when they log off and go home they're a totally normal person. I'm sure the enemy spawns in my Fallout game think I'm insanely superpowered, too. I don't believe G-d is divine. Certainly G-d exists, but not as an old man with a book of rules. (Maybe G-d's bosses should have delayed 2020.exe for further debugging.) Strictly speaking we *do* in fact have a book of rules, but quite a lot of them are easily explainable in terms of debuffs and glitches: you have to sleep and rest or your program permanently crashes. You can't eat certain foods because there is a high risk your program will permanently crash (problem fixed in later updates). The Exodus is the in-game lore for what actually happened behind the scenes. The idea that we're a simulation is a relatively recent one, but even Neil Degrasse Tyson says "yeah, there's a certain logic to that." I realize one astrophysicist does not a consensus make by any means, but it does add a bare minimum of credence that you won't find with, say . . . . someone who is 100% convinced that polyester contains government tracking chips. (Here's the source for NDT being in favor: [https://www.wesa.fm/post/neil-degrasse-tyson-childhood-curiosity-simulation-theory-and-his-visit-pittsburgh#stream/0](https://www.wesa.fm/post/neil-degrasse-tyson-childhood-curiosity-simulation-theory-and-his-visit-pittsburgh#stream/0))  #8203; So yes! Even within those in Judaism who are not atheists, you will find a wide variety of how we believe in some kind of higher power, and it may completely contradict your original hypothesis.</TEXT>

First time I'm going through it. I'm already uneasy and disturbed by literally everything around me, and I've just gotten through the cells where they kept the prisoners who were to be experimented on. At this point this has gotten genuinely stressful, and I just want to clear the dungeon and be done with it.  #8203; I round a corner into this huge room and poke around to be sure I'm not missing anything, go around a pipe . . .  #8203; . . . . and slam directly into what is clearly, blatantly, an oven for dead bodies. With bones just scattered about in front of it, like possibly bodies had been chopped up to fit more inside or incompletely-burned remains were just . . . left to rot. The implied parallel couldn't have been clearer if they'd hung up a neon sign saying THE US MILITARY USED NAZI RESEARCH AND TACTICS TO BUILD ROBOBRAINS and had the Sole give a monologue about how this is exactly what Nate's however-many-times-great-grandfather fought against.  #8203; I actually started crying and had to close the game and walk away. As I put it to a friend later, it's not that I object to it being in there. (For people who understand there's a story beyond "bang bang haha I shot you with the Broadsider," it's an *incredibly* powerful piece of storytelling.) I just would have really much preferred a warning first, so I could tackle that dungeon knowing what I was walking into.  #8203; One, that kind of storytelling takes balls. Two, the placement of that tiny piece of a much larger piece had to be *perfect*, or its impact would be lost (and clearly they perfected it).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so this is a *very* new game. So I've just gone to Drumlin Diner for the first time. to start Order Up. Wolfgang responds as he's supposed to . . . . and Trudy only returns one line of dialogue. If I talk to Wolfgang first, Trudy says she saw me talking to that poison-seller and he's not getting his money, and then won't respond to further attempts to talk. If I try to talk to Trudy first, she just says she's closed, and further attempts to talk return "I told you we're closed." (Then the quest never starts.) Killing Wolfgang and Simone allows me to get Trudy's "I got a store to run here, you gonna buy?" dialogue, but never opens a trade window.  #8203; THINGS I'VE TRIED, PLUS RESULTS:  #8203; 1) Reloading an earlier save. No effect. 2) Closing and reopening the whole game. No effect. 3) The recycleactor command. Trudy got naked, but no other effect. 4) Leaving the area and coming back. No effect. 5) Using setstage to skip to various stages of the quest, including the ending. Trudy's dialogue changes at the end as appropriate, but she still doesn't give me a trade window. (If I choose either "both live" or "Wolfgang lives," he can trade just fine, but she can't.)  #8203; There's got to be something else. Any ideas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also question how these issues will be handled. For example, take the infamous Lev. 18:22. I broke it down on Tumblr as per my own movement's interpretations, and some Orthodox dude came in and said "those are secular interpretations and hardly worth examining. It says what it says." I asked him how he could belong to a movement that believes *every single letter* says more than the sum of its parts, and three words in a single verse can be worth studying for a month, but also say "nah, it's exactly what it says on the surface" about a verse that allows him to discriminate, and not only did he block me (not that I expected different), I got yelled at by a few other Orthodox and even a couple of Conservative Jews.  #8203; Is me challenging that viewpoint automatically considered badmouthing or being rude? Am I expected to just sit there and go "oh, la, according to this group I should be killed, but that's okay, it's just their *opinion*" without saying anything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So what happens when a specific viewpoint is a direct attack on another community?  #8203; For example, I've seen Orthodox people express the "normative" view that I'm sick in the head and need to marry a man so he can "cure me" of being queer.  #8203; I don't care if they're Orthodox and that's their "opinion" or not, as far as I'm concerned that's fucking bigotry (not to mention, pseudoscience).  #8203; We can't pretend such things don't happen. A "normative view" in one community is a personal attack in another. Like my orientation, there are people who claim my gender isn't real--I don't care if you're Orthodox, Talmud itself holds that there are six genders. That "normative" view becomes a refusal to recognize me as myself.  #8203; How will things like this be adjudicated?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well if you get a Jewish boyfriend you could have some Jewish in you . . . .  #8203; I am *terribly* sorry. I so rarely get the chance to make that joke.  #8203; So the question here is twofold, as far as I'm concerned, because Judaism is an ethnoreligion. Genetically, yes, you *do* have Jewish blood. You are one-quarter Jewish, from a genetic perspective.  #8203; *Halachically,* you are not Jewish. That is, if you walked into a synagogue tomorrow--any synagogue, of any Jewish movement--and said you wanted to make aliyah over the Torah, they would say you had to convert first.  #8203; So it depends on how exactly you mean that question. If it's like "hm, my grandma was Jewish, could I be higher-risk for carrying Tay-Sachs?" then the answer is yes. If it's like "could I get married under a chuppah tomorrow?" the answer is no.</TEXT>

My life runs on a trolley-track schedule because otherwise important things get forgotten, like, you know. Medication, work, blood sugar. (That #8217;s the other problem. I #8217;m hypoglycemic. The year I converted I tried to make the fast for Ta #8217;anit Esther and fell off a stool when I passed out.)

I #8217;m one of those people who automatically quadruples the spices in any given recipe (one clove of garlic? One??

I #8217;ve seen pictures of Brooklyn chasidim doing their prayers in a parking lot blocked off with tape. It #8217;s not NO-risk, but with everyone masked it #8217;s very LOW-risk. (Mine is not. Mine is a couple hundred families because we #8217;re the only Reform shul for about thirty miles. I live in a very big metro area.) Honestly, the shofar is what I #8217;m going to miss the most. You close your eyes when it sounds and you could almost be standing in front of the Temple, or at the foot of Sinai. It #8217;s like time ceases to exist and it #8217;s just you and G-d. There is no comparison to that. The closest I #8217;ve felt to it was when I converted and the rabbi put the Torah in my arms for the first time, and that was a moment so unearthly I literally couldn #8217;t put it into words.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My best friend and her twin brother hunt cryptids for food. I'm trying to help.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 08:51:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey. You can call me Nathan. I know you normally hear from [my friend Scout](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i4o3u4/my_twin_brother_and_i_are_hunters_the_woods_have/?utm_medium=FuckOff amp;utm_source=FuckOff), but she #8217;s had one hell of a day. I know she #8217;s keeping this record, though, so I thought I #8217;d share what happened today. She #8217;d have to sooner or later anyway, and I #8217;m honestly not convinced she #8217;ll remember most of it. Big shocks have a way of doing that to you. A couple of times at work today, I noticed somebody outside the building staring in. Not the way you stare when you #8217;re deciding if you want to go get lunch or not--more like watching somebody. I wasn #8217;t sure why it reminded me of what happened during the game of hide-and-seek, but it did, and at the end of our shift I decided to invite Scout over. If my apartment was being watched by the same person from the cafe, I could always call Harley to pick her up. Safety in numbers and all that. Scout accepted, and so at shift #8217;s end I told her to follow my car. I kept an eye on her in the rearview--and an ear, too. I #8217;ve lost a lot in the last ten years, but one of the things I miss most is being able to listen to the radio while I drive. It probably sounds dumb, but--I have to be able to hear everything around me, and that includes a friend following me down the road. No watchful worries in Scout #8217;s Jeep, though--I could hear the beat of her music through both her windows and mine. My apartment is only about ten minutes from the cafe, but it #8217;s on the sixth floor, as high as I could get. I unlocked the door and glanced down the hallway before opening it. If Scout noticed, she didn #8217;t say. She did give my doorknob a weird look, though. I wasn #8217;t surprised. The story I told my landlord was something about a brass allergy and the knob I was installing being from my grandparents #8217; house, but the truth is, it #8217;s just really hard to find iron doorknobs that don #8217;t look like they #8217;re from sometime in the 1920s. If you didn #8217;t know me ten years ago, my apartment would look totally normal. Plain, but normal. It #8217;s only if you know I grew up buying everything from yard sales and secondhand places that the wall of Ikea furniture would strike you wrong. But I got tied up in someone else #8217;s problem for way too long to risk doing it again by picking up a cursed armoire or something. I headed for the kitchen and pulled a pitcher of iced tea out of the fridge. I held it up and raised my eyebrows. Scout shook her head. I poured myself a glass and went back to the living room, flopping into a sofa somewhat too new for complete comfort.  #8220;I guess it #8217;s time I told you a little more, if I #8217;m getting started with all this supernatural bullshit again. #8221; I sighed and wished I had a beer.  #8220;Again? #8221; Scout gave me this look like she was reassessing everything she #8217;d ever thought about me.  #8220;Again, #8221; I agreed.  #8220;So . . . you know I moved here to get away from my old life. I got kicked out when I was sixteen. My parents were, you know, the come-to-Jesus type. They weren #8217;t really happy about finding me and my best friend on the sofa not actually playing MarioKart. His name was Chris. #8221; Scout winced.  #8220;That sucks, I #8217;m sorry. #8221; Then she gave me a grin.  #8220;Shame, though. Always the cute ones. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, they #8217;re all straight or taken, I know. Or total assholes. #8221; I let my hands hang between my knees just so I wouldn #8217;t start fidgeting.  #8220;That #8217;s how I knew you were telling the truth. #8221;  #8220;Okay, ow. I know a bad breakup when I hear one. #8221; She gave me that intense reassessing look again.  #8220;But what #8217;s that got to do with us? #8221;  #8220;Let #8217;s just say, after hearing your story, I think I #8217;m lucky I was too old to be on the menu. #8221; I sat back.  #8220;So I moved out here. My ex owed me some money from work and when I got it I just picked up the keys and went. I didn #8217;t have anything to pack, so . . . it was pretty easy to go. I just hit every town between here and there looking for somebody doing on-the-spot hiring and when I found one, I stayed. #8221;  #8220;So this is home now? #8221;  #8220;Maybe. For now, anyway. #8221; Home enough to put iron nails in the windowsills, anyway. I scrubbed my face with one hand.  #8220;You know, nobody tells you growing whiskers *itches.* #8221; Scout started laughing, and after a couple of seconds I joined her. She #8217;s got one of those laughs so infectious, it #8217;s hard not to. And then somebody banged on my door and we both stopped. I thought about getting in the coat closet, the irony of which was completely not lost on me, but there #8217;s barely room in it for a jacket and a backpack. I might fit, but it #8217;d leave Scout out in the open, and my apartment is so small she wouldn #8217;t have anywhere to go. And there was nobody around to help us if I just gave up and cried. Somewhere between here and the other side of the country, I #8217;d found one of those little pagan shops that always seem to be run by a chick with dark hair and huge eyes and a lip piercing. This particular chick with dark hair and huge eyes was named Delia, and she offered me a temp job, which I took. Worked there for a couple of weeks, in fact, and thought for awhile I might end up staying there. All of that changed one night after close when she asked if I wanted her to read my tarot cards. I told her I didn #8217;t know if I believed in tarot, and then told her something I don #8217;t even like admitting to myself, really: I don #8217;t know what I believe in anymore. She told me that whether I believed the cards had any kind of supernatural energy or not, they might help me find a path forward. So I told her to go ahead. She asked if I had anything with me that I #8217;d had for a long time, something  #8220;drenched in my energy, #8221; so I gave her the blanket out of the back of the car. I #8217;d had it wrapped around me for almost a decade, and if that wasn #8217;t drenched enough, nothing would be. She laid it over her knees and set up a series of cards. Maybe it #8217;s all just a cold read, but I have to be honest, it didn #8217;t feel that way when she laid out the cards and asked me to pull one without looking that  #8220;drew me, #8221; took one look at it and told me I was running away from something. And then flipped the card she said represented my past, looked at it, and said  #8220;This is a woman you relied on. Except it isn #8217;t a woman, is it? It was a man and he needed you more than you needed him, and in the end it cost him a life and his happiness. #8221; She paused.  #8220;No . . . not a life, not exactly. Nobody #8217;s died. #8221; I swear I hadn #8217;t moved until she said it, and when I kind of stared at her she went into way more detail than I feel comfortable putting down here. Stuff nobody else would know unless they #8217;d laid in my bed to hear my secrets, and she certainly hadn #8217;t done that. She was almost done, only two cards to go, when her head suddenly dropped forward. I reached out to touch her shoulder and it snapped back up, seeming to move far more freely than a human neck should be capable of, and her lips split into a wide, insane grin I knew all too well.  #8220;Hello, Nathan, #8221; she said. Or her voice said. It wasn #8217;t her at all, and I knew it from the moment the grin appeared. It didn #8217;t belong to her, or any woman I #8217;d ever met. Any *human* I #8217;d ever met.  #8220;Miss me? #8221; I didn #8217;t answer. I could barely breathe, for that matter. She flipped the second-to-last card, but it wasn #8217;t the same kind of nearly-reverent, soft setting of the card she #8217;d done before--instead she almost twirled it between her fingers, like a fancy blackjack dealer. Or an Old West outlaw. The grin turned decidedly predatory.  #8220;Ah. You know who *this* is, of course, #8221; she said, and tapped the card. *The Hanged Man*, it said.  #8220;She begs me to kill her near-constantly. Would you like to say hello? I think I #8217;d like you to hear her weep. #8221; I grabbed the first thing to my right and swung it. The not-a-person wearing Delia #8217;s face ducked, and her head dropped forward again. She shook it and looked up at me, blinking.  #8220;I think I actually fell asleep, #8221; she said.  #8220;I #8217;m sorry. Sometimes when you #8217;re really in tune with something-- #8221;  #8220;What is that? #8221; I #8217;m pretty sure it #8217;s actually rude to grab someone #8217;s tarot cards, but the one she #8217;d had me pick for myself was gone, and there was another one in its place. She took it out of my hand.  #8220;The Tower, #8221; she told me. Her face went from neutral to dismayed.  #8220;It #8217;s the most feared card in the deck. It means disaster. Someone is wishing you harm. #8221; I left the next day. She paid me for the entire week, even though it was only a Tuesday, and then handed me the object I #8217;d swung at her head the night before.  #8220;It chose you, when you needed it, #8221; she said.  #8220;It wants to go with you. #8221; Then she just looked sad.  #8220;I pulled a card this morning before I came. I knew you #8217;d be leaving. #8221; She handed it to me: The Devil.  #8220;He #8217;ll be looking for you. Don #8217;t let him find you. #8221; I still had the object she #8217;d given me the day I left the shop, and locked in my apartment with Scout and nowhere to hide I pulled it out of my end table before heading for the door. I swung it open and offered up a greeting before I even saw who was on the other side.  #8220;You #8217;re not invited. #8221; The man on the other side of my door had a thick black ponytail that would #8217;ve been adorable if he hadn #8217;t smelled like an ashtray. It was also pretty much the cutest thing about him. Some people like the greasy mechanic look, but I #8217;m not one of them. He looked startled, though, and confused, and both of those things were better than pissed, which would #8217;ve told me I had way more problems than some rando knocking on my door.  #8220;Uh . . . . sorry, #8221; he said.  #8220;I, uh--is Scout here? #8221;  #8220;I live here. #8221;  #8220;I know, um, I mean, I know she doesn #8217;t. I just saw you guys and thought I could catch up with her. Uh--are you her boyfriend? #8221;  #8220;Well, that definitely doesn #8217;t sound like you #8217;re a psycho stalker, and none of your damn business. #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s okay. I know him. #8221; Scout peered out from behind me.  #8220;I think. It #8217;s complicated. He #8217;s the guy who was working on my Jeep. #8221; I kept my eyes on Black Ponytail.  #8220;That #8217;s nice. Why are you following her? #8221;  #8220;She, uh. She #8217;s right about being complicated. I just need to talk to her. #8221; He put his hands up. They were empty, but I know enough now to know that doesn #8217;t mean anything. I took a step back and raised the knife in my hand.  #8220;You can come in. But you #8217;d better know this is iron and I am *extremely* good with knives. #8221; Mostly paring knives, not pagan-ritual-altar knives--or athames, if you #8217;re Delia, I guess--but he didn #8217;t need to know that.  #8220;Uh . . . thanks. #8221; He took a step in, looking like he was pretty sure he was walking into a trap. That was okay. Better him than me. "I know who you mixed me up with," he said, addressing Scout. She didn't answer him right away. Her breathing slowed from the fear we #8217;d both dived headfirst into when the guy first tried to destroy my door. Her hands dropped to her sides. When she finally regained her voice, the first words to leave her lips were "you're not him." "Of course not." He paused. "Did you know his name?" "Spidereater," she said. "I only ever called him the Spidereater." "Fair enough. It was Eddie, though. That's what my mom called him, at least." "Who *are* you?" He took in a deep, hissing breath. "The name's Van. I'm his son." Scout looked another word away from fainting. I took her by the arm and led her over to my sofa, nodding curtly for Van to join us. He sat down across from us, and even though the chair he sat in was plastic I hoped the smell of him wasn #8217;t going to rub off. His gaze flitted over to me, and I thought I could see a faint hint of recognition in his eyes. "You," he muttered, but his voice trailed off. I shifted uncomfortably in my seat and tightened my grip on the knife. He shook his head like he was trying to chase a thought from his mind before looking at Scout again. "Where is he?" she whispered. "If you're really his son, then where is he? What are you doing here?" "My father is dead," Van replied quietly. Scout let out a single sob as her head sank and her shoulders trembled. It took her a few seconds to speak up again. "How did he die? And when?" "He died seven years ago. The grinning beast got him. I'm pretty sure you've seen it before." "Smiley," she murmured. Van chuckled dryly. "Smiley, is that what you call it? Not bad. Either way, it's an enforcer of sorts. It comes to the surface every seven years, looking for enemies to kill. It #8217;s an important number, you know, seven--to the ones underground, I mean. It doesn't always succeed in catching what it #8217;s hunting--or who--but I think it gets worse every time it comes. More violent. Eddie was good at hiding and fleeing, but it got him when it last came up here." Scout's lower lip was quivering. "What was he?" she breathed. "He wasn't human, but I think you knew that already." He sighed. "There's a second town beneath the ground. Not actually a town, more like a state, or--never mind, it's like a parallel dimension or some shit. Okay, I don't know the details. I've only been there a few times. But there's a race of creatures that inhabit it. There's plenty of names for them, but I like the term Wild Ones best. Eddie was one of them." I winced. *Wild Ones*. A name I was all too familiar with. The man in the biker jacket gave me a curious glance, then went on. "He didn't like the underground, I guess. Those who live there aren't really allowed to go outside apparently. Or--they #8217;re allowed to go, but they're not allowed to *live* on the surface. Long story short, Eddie fled. He made it out and even though Smiley tried to chase him down, he managed to escape it. At least for a long while. There's some Wild Ones who look a lot like humans, and he was one of those, so once he had clothes and all he fit in pretty well. But I guess in the end it didn't get him very far." Scout's shoulders started to shake again as she buried her face in her palms and began to cry. I scooted over to her and rested my hand on her back. Van looked genuinely sad. "I'm sorry," he said softly. "I didn't mean to drop this on you like that. I just thought that by now  #8211;" "It's okay," she interrupted him. "All this time, I thought #8230; I thought he'd come back, you know. Someday." Nobody said a word until I finally felt about ready to speak up again. "So how do you know who she is?" "It's complicated." "You don't say." "No--" Van fumbled for words. "I could sense it. I'm not that perceptive. I'm mostly just a normal guy, you know. Iron doesn't harm me. Blades do, though." He nodded at the athame, where I #8217;d finally put it down to at least try and help Scout. "When I saw her car, I just kinda . . . . knew . . . it was hers." He turned to face Scout. "You feel like him, it sounds weird but #8230; you have it written all over you." She smiled joylessly. "So do you." "So what are you planning to do now? And why are you here?" I asked. "That's the thing. Smiley will be back soon. I don't know how soon, but #8230; soon." Scout tilted her head. "Is there something we can do about it?" "I've been thinking about that a lot. I don't know . . . I always wanted to. Do something. But I have no idea how," Van confessed. "I'll help you," Scout replied. Her voice was firm, albeit strained. "My brother probably will too. We could figure it out." Van nodded. "I've been around your house before. I've seen him." "Thought so." He suddenly turned to look at me. "What about you?" I was rendered speechless. I just looked down at my hands for a pause about two years long before looking back up.  #8220;I knew someone who went up against the Wild Ones, once. She #8217;d tell you it #8217;s a fool #8217;s errand. If she still could. #8221; Scout and Van both winced. I sighed.  #8220;Screw it. If you get killed I have to find new friends, if your brother doesn #8217;t take me out first. #8221; Scout laughed like I #8217;d startled it out of her. I shrugged.  #8220;I #8217;m in. Why the hell not. #8221; I glanced at Van.  #8220;Let the record show I still don #8217;t trust you. At all. #8221;  #8220;I wouldn #8217;t expect you to. From what I #8217;ve seen and heard, I already know I #8217;ll have to earn it. #8221; He paused.  #8220;What should I call you? #8221;  #8220;Let #8217;s just go with Nate for now. #8221;  #8220;That #8217;ll do. #8221; The look he gave me wasn #8217;t one I #8217;d expect out of somebody even remotely affiliated with the Wild Ones--kind of sad and sympathetic.  #8220;You don #8217;t happen to know anything that might be helpful, do you? #8221;  #8220;I know some of them are so powerful you can literally feed them iron and they can still get up and walk away. I know they have ways of making you do what they want . . . forcing you to do what they want. Even to the point of turning the people closest to you against you, if that #8217;s what they have to do. #8221; I found the handle of the knife again and squeezed it, just to have something to hold onto that wasn #8217;t my own fingers.  #8220;And I know from the minute you set foot down there you #8217;re doomed. I have no idea how you #8217;re sitting here. Either you #8217;re lying, or you weren #8217;t there that long ago. Or maybe there #8217;s something about your father being one of them that kept things from going south. But you can #8217;t hunt it there. Or at least, Scout and I can #8217;t. #8221; I sighed and looked at her.  #8220;Think your brother might have any ideas? #8221; Scout shrugged.  #8220;It #8217;s worth asking. #8221; Van suggested we meet up with Harley to recap and see if we couldn #8217;t make a battle plan. We saw Scout safely into her Jeep, and I was relieved to see Van get onto a motorbike before I settled behind the wheel of my own. I wouldn #8217;t have told him I couldn #8217;t give him a ride, but I #8217;d *never* get the smell of cigarettes out of my car if I did. I just hope this isn #8217;t going to [get us all killed](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i5w0km/my_twin_brother_and_i_are_hunters_we_tried_to/?utm_medium=FuckOff amp;utm_source=FuckOff).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-07 23:26:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this probably sounds like a troll post, but I #8217;m dead serious. I had less than a swallow of tea left, it tipped over my phone, I thought I #8217;d dried it all but apparently a couple drops got into the volume buttons and sound toggle. The sound toggle works, it #8217;s just sticky. (And regular use is loosening it back up just fine.) The buttons, however, might as well be dipped in cement. I have a third-party place I normally go for repairs, but they won #8217;t touch it because sight unseen they #8217;ve decided it #8217;s not repairable. (When I pointed out that it #8217;s just sticky and needs cleaned but I don #8217;t have the tools to take it apart, the guy went  #8220;well you #8217;d have to completely disassemble it. #8221; Yes, and...I #8217;m.....offering to pay you? To do that?) Is there a way to fix this at home? Do I have to go to Verizon? I know full well if I go to the Apple Store they #8217;re going to try to sell me the new SE. The one I have works just fine, except for this single problem my own dumb ass created, and I do not want an upgrade right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, no problem!  #8203; So you're talking about I Used To Be A Stagecoach Driver, And Now I'm Not. While I *am* the author of Stagecoach, it's entirely a post-original-canon AU. (And yes, while the AO3 version is a compilation, there is also more to the story there. Think of it as the director's-cut version, where I get to slow down and take my time and rework the bumps and bruises that came with writing it so quickly in the first place.) It's fanfiction. I am. *Embarrassedly* flattered that you considered it canon, but nope. Stagecoach picks up three weeks after Desiderium and from that point would now be considered canon divergence.  #8203; Twins is an extension of the original canon, which /u/girl_from_the_crypt very sweetly and graciously asked me to work on with her because she liked Stagecoach (*what the fuck*). It follows Amusement Park and is roughly concurrent with, or very slightly after, Hollow Valley, and has no relation to Stagecoach at all.  #8203; With GFTC's permission and input I *did* port over a couple of things from Stagecoach canon, like Nathan being a preacher's son, but it's still a totally different Nathan, including the fact that canon!Nathan wouldn't say half the shit Stagecoach!Nathan does. (Canon!Nathan didn't lose his politeness filter somewhere in Twin Vale. Stagecoach!Nathan did.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Calling all crafters: Ideas for my old manager shirts?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-08 07:15:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we recently got all-new uniforms, and the shirts I've been wearing for the last four years are being, sadly, laid to rest. The pattern on that hideous blue-and-orange-plaid shirt matches almost perfectly with the pattern on the skirt for an anime cosplay I've been planning to do, so a couple of my blue-and-oranges are being unpicked and saved for that, but . . .  #8203; . . . . WHAT TO DO WITH THE REST OF THEM?  #8203; I wear a 2X men's and have two additional short-sleeved blue-and-oranges, a short-sleeved denim, a long-sleeved black-and-white check (actually two long-sleeved black-and-white checks, I just have no idea where the fuck one of them has run off to), and one of those godawful army gray-green solid-color shirts we all got and absolutely nobody wore because they were super-sturdy but uglier than sin.  #8203; I'm a big fan of upcycling and don't want to just throw them all away. Any crafters here have some fun ideas? I was thinking of possibly weaving the denim and blue-and-orange into a hobo bag and lining it with the gray-green, but I'm not sure I'd have enough denim to do a cool pattern.  #8203; Please keep in mind that while I do have access to a sewing machine it's from the 1940s, so it's a steel beast that can sew forward and backward and that's it. Anything I can stitch by hand is a *major* plus. (i.e., don't suggest embroidery.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My best friend and her twin brother hunt cryptids for food. We're trying to make a plan.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-09 08:48:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>We were on our expedition [to find passages](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i5acwu/my_best_friend_and_her_twin_brother_hunt_cryptids/) to the underground in the woods when the nightmare happened. Harley and I had been walking ahead, with Scout and Van tagging behind. I tried to keep an eye out for the two, but talking to Harley had proven rather interesting--I #8217;d heard a little about him from Scout, but she and I had plenty of time to kill at work between customers, while he and I had barely ever met. Also, I felt like if I didn't keep him mentally occupied, he'd just flip out and possibly try to kill all of us. Ever since Van showed up at their place, Harley had been ready to erupt. Scout and Harley both have a little bit of a temper, but he #8217;s definitely got a low simmer she doesn #8217;t. "I don't trust this guy," he'd just muttered at me for what had to be the fifteenth time, and I nodded--I was pretty sure my reasons for distrusting Van were totally different than Harley #8217;s, but that didn #8217;t mean I disagreed at all. I was about to say something when suddenly, I heard Van shout. Harley and I spun around to find someone standing between the four of us. Or some*thing*, rather. It was tall and almost entirely naked, wearing only what looked like a torn apron. There wasn't a single hair on its body, and when it turned to face us, my stomach must have dropped. It had no eyes, no nose; just an enormous mouth stretched into an unnaturally wide grin, baring rows upon rows of needle-like teeth. It looked like a reject from a Guillermo del Toro movie--one he cut out for being too nightmarish. No doubt about it: this had to be Smiley. I'll never forget the look on Scout's face #8211;a mix of naked calculation, recognition, and fear. The creature was standing between us, its posture lowered and menacing like a predator about to attack. It seemed to be trying to decide on which pair of us to lunge at first. Scout was faster, though. "Run," she mouthed, giving an almost unnoticeable nod into the opposite direction before grabbing hold of Van's sleeve and dashing off with him. Before I knew it, Harley hurled the box of nails into Smiley's face, took me by the arm and dragged me along as he ran off. The thing let out an enraged shriek as dozens of tiny pieces of iron hit its body. I didn't dare to look behind us as I stumbled after Harley as fast as I could, but I was hoping a couple might have actually caught it point-first and stuck. Harley was almost impossible to keep up with. He led me through the woods in roundabout ways, his firm grip on my wrist never loosening. "Where are we going?" It was hard to even get it out--I think of myself as being reasonably fit, but I was way outmatched, and it was all I could do to gasp it between breaths. Harley didn #8217;t answer--he seemed so focused on the way ahead of us I don't think he heard me at all. When the white facade of his and Scout's large house came back into sight, I realized we had merely taken a detour to confuse the Wild One. To my great relief, I saw Scout's bright hair emerge from the dark thicket like a torch. I don't know why I thought it, and certainly not then, but the twins have beautiful hair #8211;Harley too. You'd think his head would shine in the darkness like a flame. We met Van and Scout halfway. Van was gasping for air, his broad chest heaving and falling. Scout seemed hardly fazed at all. "We have to lock up the house! Harley, get in the back and get the cars started!" she ordered, reaching into her pocket to toss him her car keys. He caught them mid-air, let go of my hand and rushed around the corner of the house. I couldn't even put one foot in front of the other, to be honest. I just stood there, trying hard to catch my breath while Scout ran up to the back door and began to fumble around with the lock. I began to stagger toward the building's front, trying to wave at Van to come with me, but he shook his head. Instead, he stared at the treeline, occasionally glancing over at Scout. It was like he was on guard, or something. Finally, she hopped down from the porch and started toward the cars. The twins #8217; house isn #8217;t just close to the woods--it #8217;s almost part of them itself, small trees and bushes marching along the sides of the house and down the driveway, and in hindsight, we really should have known what would happen. I #8217;d thought we #8217;d left Smiley in the forest, but no--and when it jumped out in front of me I almost screamed. "Shit!" Scout yelped as she stumbled backward and pressed her back up against me, seemingly in an attempt to shield me. My mind raced. I reached for the athame, but I didn't dare get close enough to use it. The back door was locked--we wouldn't be able to make it inside in time. With the way Smiley was heading for us--almost stalking us--it seemed to be enjoying our anguish. And then, suddenly, Van stepped out right in front of it. I don #8217;t know if I can describe what happened, exactly, but he suddenly seemed . . . *bigger*. He was still breathing heavily, but there was a kind of clicking, hissing noise mixed in with his breath. It sounded like nothing I #8217;d ever heard from a human being before--more like an insect, or a dangerous piece of machinery. I glanced at his hands. They were hooked into gauntleted claws, so stiff it looked almost painful. Even Smiley appeared to be taken aback. It took a few steps toward him, only for his labored breathing to grow louder and more menacing. I was terrified, and not just of Smiley, either. Scout continued to slowly push me back, trying to distance the two of us from it, but we didn #8217;t go unnoticed. The faceless grinning thing lunged toward us, only for Van to throw himself against it. He hissed, *loudly*, and shoved it to the ground. "Holy shit," Scout whispered. She stumbled backward and landed on her butt, pulling me down with her. I stared at the pair battling on the ground. Getting out of there was the last thing on my mind--I could barely breathe, much less stand and run. Instead we watched as Van pinned the Wild One to the ground. It still seemed too stunned to fight back, its ever-grinning face turned up at the black-haired man in disbelief. Van looked up only once during the whole thing. I could only see his face for a second, but a second was all it took--something was very wrong with his face. His mouth was hanging open, and for a second I thought I saw two thin, curved fangs protruding from it. After a few seconds, Smiley seemed to regain its composure. It pushed Van off, and dragged its sharp fingernails across his chest, prompting a very human-sounding scream. Still--that seemed to be enough for it to abort its mission. It rushed off to the treeline in large leaps, leaving the three of us by ourselves. Van pushed himself back to his feet. His fangs had vanished, but he was still hissing under his breath. There was something else, though, something I couldn #8217;t quite put my finger on. So when he began to stagger toward Scout, who was cowering on the ground next to me, I staggered to my feet. I pulled my athame and stood between them. "Don't come any closer," I called, hoping he wouldn't hear my voice shaking.  #8220;You stay right where you are. #8221; He ignored me.  #8220;Hey, I just wanted to see if you guys are-- #8221; And then I tried to stab him. I #8217;m a small guy. I always have been--I was that kid in school who stood at the front of every concert and class photo because I was a head shorter than everyone else. Van, on the other hand, was tall even before whatever weird transformation he #8217;d undergone, and he grabbed my knife hand and pulled me onto my toes like the world #8217;s most unprepared ballet dancer with pretty much no effort at all. He squeezed my wrist like he was trying to get me to drop the athame. I just squeezed it harder, and he stared at me the way he did back in my apartment, like he was sure he #8217;d seen me somewhere before. Face to face, I could see what #8217;d been bothering me before--his eyes were *bigger*, just like the rest of him, and the pupils weren #8217;t normal pupils anymore. They were split into four, resulting in eight little dots like spiders #8217; eyes, little black clusters where normal irises should have been. I tried to hit him to get away. Which probably wasn #8217;t the smartest thing I could #8217;ve done under any circumstances, but I wasn #8217;t expecting him to be so *fast* when he grabbed my other arm and lifted me straight off the ground.  #8220;Let #8217;s get something straight, #8221; he said, and his voice was that kind of soft where you wish the person was yelling because it #8217;d be less frightening.  #8220;I have no interest in hurting you. Or Scout. Or Harley. Or anyone, really. But if you make me defend myself, I won #8217;t be responsible for what happens to you. Do we understand each other? #8221; I didn #8217;t answer him. I opened my mouth, but nothing really came out. Instead I felt tears rolling down my face. It #8217;s not my prettiest character trait, but it #8217;s a pretty consistent one. He let me back down onto my feet, and someone grabbed my elbow from behind. I gasped and turned and almost hit Harley in the face by accident. He pulled me away from Van, and if looks could kill he would #8217;ve left Smiley a pretty decent meal.  #8220;The hell is wrong with you? He didn #8217;t do anything to you. #8221;  #8220;He literally *tried to stab me*. #8221;  #8220;Yeah, well, you can #8217;t blame him for missing, I don #8217;t think he #8217;s had a whole lot of practice. #8221;  #8220;*Enough*, #8221; Scout cut in.  #8220;We can #8217;t just stand out here talking. We #8217;re too exposed. Come on. Van can ride with me, and Harley can ride with-- #8221;  #8220;No way, I #8217;m not leaving you alone with him! #8221;  #8220;We just found out he lied to us, Scout, I don #8217;t think that #8217;s the best-- #8221;  #8220;Let me see your knife. #8221; I stared at Van.  #8220;Do I look stupid to you? #8221;  #8220;Do you really want me to answer that question? #8221; He sighed and shook his head.  #8220;Forget it. Just draw it, would you? #8221; I pulled the athame, keeping an eye on him the whole time. My wrist hurt where he #8217;d squeezed it, and I swapped from my right hand to my left. My aim couldn #8217;t get much worse, but my grip could. Van reached for it and I took a step backward.  #8220;Chill. #8221; He reached for it again and put his hand on the blade.  #8220;Everyone here gets to your place safe. At least as far as I have control over the situation, they do. You have my word on iron. #8221;  #8220;I thought you said iron didn #8217;t matter to you. #8221;  #8220;I said it doesn #8217;t harm me. That #8217;s true. But it matters to *you*. And I think that knife specifically matters to you, too. #8221; He took his hand away.  #8220;Scout #8217;s right, we #8217;re way too exposed out here. But I #8217;ll explain when we #8217;re inside, and I promise I #8217;ll explain everything. As much as I can, anyway. There are things even I don #8217;t know. But I #8217;ll try. #8221; I just nodded at him. He swung into Scout #8217;s car, and I slipped into Harley #8217;s passenger seat and curled up against the window. His radio was on some alt-rock station, and I bit my lip and stared at it until finally I couldn #8217;t take it anymore and reached out to click it off. Harley gave me a weird look. I opened my mouth to apologize and say something, anything, but he shook his head and waited for Scout and Van to pull out ahead of us before reaching out and giving my good hand a squeeze. Van was good to his word, at least as far as all of us getting to my place in one piece. I unlocked the door and tapped the mirror to its left as I stepped in, then took a look around before opening the door to everyone else.  #8220;I think we #8217;re good. #8221; I went to the kitchen to get drinks while everybody else got settled. I wanted a minute to clear my mind, but when I reached for a glass it slid through my fingers and shattered on the counter, and I almost started bawling.  #8220;Step back, you #8217;re going to cut yourself. #8221; It was Van #8217;s voice, but I stepped back anyway. He was probably right. I covered my eyes and heard the soft tinkle of glass being swept up and thrown away before he took my elbow.  #8220;Look, I wanted to talk to you before we all sit down. It doesn #8217;t take a genius to look around here and see you #8217;ve had some bad experiences with this kind of thing before. I don #8217;t know what they were. It #8217;s not really my business and I doubt you #8217;d tell me even if it was. But I want you to know, directly from me to you, whoever fucked you over before probably hates me, too. I #8217;m not some kind of double agent. If you #8217;re in this for Scout, we #8217;re on the same side. I won #8217;t ask you to trust me. But please believe me when I say I lied for my own protection, nothing else. #8221; I nodded. He pulled another glass out of the cabinet and handed it to me before walking back into the living room. I filled some glasses and walked them out.  #8220;So now what? #8221; Scout was on one end of the sofa, Harley on the other. Van took the same chair he #8217;d been in before. I thought about sitting on the coffee table and decided to take a patch of floor next to Harley #8217;s leg, instead. Van drained half his glass at one go, and I winced. Someday, stuff like that isn #8217;t going to bother me anymore. Today wasn #8217;t that day. If he noticed, he didn #8217;t say--just leaned back in the chair.  #8220;Not to put too fine a point on it, we could be screwed, #8221; he said.  #8220;It #8217;s here. It knows we #8217;re looking for it. It knows we know it #8217;s here. Between us we have very few weapons and your boyfriend has an extremely bad case of fight-or-freeze and it leans to the freeze end. #8221;  #8220;Boyfriend? #8221; Scout said it, but both the twins made the same face at the same time. Or almost the same face. They #8217;re not really identical, if you know how to look. Van gestured at me. Maybe it was just residual adrenaline from the fight with Smiley. Or maybe it #8217;s really actually that funny, I don #8217;t know. Anyway, I started laughing so hard I choked. Harley grabbed my shoulders and pulled me against his leg before I could fall over. Scout was laughing, too, and even Harley was chuckling a little, but I didn #8217;t stop until there were literal tears in my eyes. Van just raised his eyebrows at us.  #8220;I stand corrected. #8221; I wanted to say something coherent, but instead I just started howling laughter again. I wiped my eyes.  #8220;Listen, #8221; I told him, fighting down giggles before they could turn into hysterics.  #8220;Scout is great. But she #8217;d have to have one *hell* of a surprise in those jeans and I #8217;m pretty sure she doesn #8217;t. #8221; Van just made this kind of *huh?* face at me, and I gave up on tamping down the laughter. I turned to look up at Harley and slammed my head against his knee, still laughing so hard I barely noticed.  #8220;It #8217;s the beard, isn #8217;t it? He thinks I #8217;m straight because of the beard. I #8217;m shaving as soon as this is all over. I didn #8217;t like it anyway. Maybe I #8217;ll get a lip ring and see if that helps. #8221; Van still looked like he didn #8217;t totally get it, but he shook his head anyway.  #8220;Doesn #8217;t change the problem, though. What we really need is an ally. Someone who actually knows something about the underground. #8221; He sighed and rubbed at his face.  #8220;I know you #8217;re going to wonder, after this morning . . . . why that can #8217;t be me. The answer is nobody really knows what I am. Human-Wild One hybrids are rare, and most of them get left as changelings. I might be the only hybrid in existence who was actually raised by my birth family. There are a lot of Wild Ones down there who are at total odds with me even being allowed to exist, and if I knew how to control my own transformation I could probably hold off one or two at a time, but I don #8217;t. I #8217;m too human to be one of them and too much one of them to fully fit in as a human. Whether that makes me a mistake or a miracle is still up for grabs. What it doesn #8217;t make me is an asset. #8221; He sighed.  #8220;If my dad was here, he #8217;d know people. But he isn #8217;t. #8221; I saw Scout duck her head. Harley did the same, but less in grief and more in thought. Then he glanced up at her.  #8220;Hey, what about your queen, mistress, whoever lady? The one you said rescued you when you set off your own trap? #8221; Scout met his eyes.  #8220;The Mistress of the Woods? #8221;  #8220;That #8217;s the one. Think she #8217;d help us? #8221; Scout shrugged.  #8220;Worth a shot, I guess, but I have no idea how to find her. #8221;  #8220;Offerings? #8221; I leaned forward to see around Harley #8217;s knee.  #8220;Could say you have gifts for her? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, but offerings like what? #8221; Harley asked. I opened my mouth, shut it, and then he raised his eyebrows at me.  #8220;I have a couple of bags of Reese #8217;s Pieces in my car. #8221; Harley snorted. I was going to ask if he had any better ideas, and then my mouth dropped open and I went scrambling to the kitchen. I got back and dropped a bottle on the sofa.  #8220;Here. #8221; Harley picked it up.  #8220;Sweet red? Solo drinking doesn #8217;t really seem to be your style. #8221;  #8220;I got it for cherries jubilee because brandy tastes like ass, but I can always get more. #8221; He gave me a puzzled look.  #8220;The hell is a cherry jubilee? #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s cherries and sugar mashed together and then you pour alcohol on it and light it on fire and serve it over ice cream. #8221; I flopped down between him and Scout.  #8220;You might be able to eat it, actually. Hey, when all this is over I should make some. We can celebrate. #8221;  #8220;We #8217;re getting off-track, #8221; Van said.  #8220;So what #8217;s the plan? We take the wine to the woods and just call for her, and then ask . . . what? #8221;  #8220;Your Royal Majesty, we #8217;d like your help killing one of your subjects, #8221; Harley said.  #8220;Maybe two, depending. #8221; Scout gave him a dirty look, but ignored him otherwise.  #8220;Or at least stopping it, yeah. We #8217;re not trying to be malicious. We #8217;re just trying to live. #8221; She pushed herself to her feet.  #8220;If we go now we #8217;ll still have a few hours of daylight. #8221; I stood up. At least, I think I did. The next thing I remember is actually laying on the sofa with Harley staring intently at me.  #8220;He #8217;s awake. You okay? #8221; I shook my head and the corners of my vision turned gray.  #8220;No, I . . . .  #8221; I felt my stomach cramp.  #8220;Oh. Shit. Um, I should probably eat something. #8221; Scout looked dismayed.  #8220;*Fuck,* #8221; she said.  #8220;I #8217;m so sorry, I forgot-- #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s okay. Uh--I #8217;ve got some grapes, if you guys want anything, and I think some raspberries. I #8217;m just going to get a sandwich. #8221; I glanced over at Van.  #8220;Hungry? #8221;  #8220;I #8217;ll pass, but you might want to take a couple extras for yourself. #8221; I nodded and headed for the kitchen, throwing whatever fruit I had into a bowl for the twins while I waited for my leftover chicken to heat up. I tossed it between some bread and called it good. Not exactly gourmet, but filling, and I went back to the living room with the fruit and my sandwich. We ate our fill. At some point Van went to the kitchen and came back with the last chicken drumstick between his teeth, and when we were done Scout took the bowl and my plate to the kitchen to put in the sink. I took a deep breath.  #8220;Okay, #8221; I said, and hoped this wasn #8217;t as terrible an idea as it felt like.  #8220;[Let #8217;s go](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i7o9zs/my_twin_sister_and_i_are_hunters_we_killed_a/?utm_medium=FuckOff amp;utm_source=FuckOff). #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly this.  #8203; The two Nathans are actually a lot more different than you might think. A very few things from Stagecoach got ported into canon, but it's *very* few.  #8203; Quick rundown:  #8203; Stagecoach!Nathan: Facecast as [young Dule Hill](https://tenor.com/view/holes-sam-the-onion-man-dule-hill-ican-fix-that-fix-gif-4037380). Stopped giving a shit what you think of his mouth somewhere in Twin Vale while trying to be at least marginally as horrible to Warin as Warin was to him. Loves MCR and Dashboard Confessional, but not exactly an emo boy. Preacher's son. Excellent cook. Wants to be a kindergarten teacher, or is at least strongly considering it. *Kind of* street smart from the space of time he spent after being kicked out of home, but with massive gaps in said smarts. So-so student even before he had to drop out, which is at least part of why he wants to be a teacher. ("He can do the work" was a constant refrain at parent-teacher conferences, with his reply being "if it wasn't so *boring.*") Not really into fashion, but has an excellent eye for color and will definitely offer opinions if you try to put neon green and orange together. Simultaneously the most forgiving person and best grudge-holder in the entire universe.  #8203; Canon: Nathan: I have a personal facecast, which is [Mara Rooney as Lisbeth Salander](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2011/12/20/15/salander.jpg?w968) (only with fewer piercings 'cause he's precious and scared of piercings), but your mileage may vary. *Ridiculously* polite, but paranoid. Preacher's son. Excellent cook. No further ambitions than waiting tables, at least not right now. Sweet, naive, trying to learn quickly how to protect himself from the Wild Ones but good lord child stop being so precious about it. Still as emo as he was in 2008 in both clothing and music and doesn't give a fuck if that bothers you, which is probably the *only* thing he legitimately gives no fucks about. Lives his entire life in band shirts and jeans. Probably doesn't know what a grudge *is.*  #8203; So yeah! Know Your Nathans They're Very Different. :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OMG SAME.

So she likes [this guy](https://bleepmagdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/lvrentcast24n-16-web.jpg?w=620) for Stagecoach!Nathan, which is pretty hilarious because he's best known as [this guy](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mJYuKprJZK8/hqdefault.jpg), who in full productions of this show rather than just concerts is dressed [like this](https://www.wallofcelebrities.com/celebrity/wilson-jermaine-heredia/pictures/xlarge/wilson-jermaine-heredia_539680.jpg).

    <TITLE>My best friend and her brother hunt cryptids for food. Today we called a truce with an opponent. [FINAL]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-13 09:29:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the four of us emerged from [the dark tunnel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i8abjf/my_twin_sister_and_i_are_hunters_all_hail_the/?utm_medium=FuckOff amp;utm_source=FuckOff), the moon was already hanging in the sky, casting its bright glow onto the pond and the two figures standing across from each other beside it, the only thing separating them the carcass of a slain cryptid. I shivered. Scout was right--even as a washed-out figure in the moonlight, Oberon gave off an aura that was almost menacing. It wasn #8217;t hard to imagine his hands--and arms, and chest, and face--covered thickly with blood. The Mistress was three times the size of her husband and was looking down at him with an expression I can hardly describe. I thought there was contempt in her gaze, but affection mixed with it to create a sense of regret. Meanwhile, Oberon was staring up at her, his proud features almost impossible to read. They didn't pay us any mind as we drew close. "They're a beautiful couple, don't you think?" Scout murmured. "They are," I heard Van reply in a low voice. "Although I do have some technical questions . . . " He fell silent when she nudged him. "Well met, Titania," the man with the golden hair spoke up, his pleasant deep voice bearing an odd, sighing undercurrent I hadn't noticed before. "My Lord," she replied. She sounded sad, but her words held no venom. "How long has it been since I last saw you outside of that wretched place? I fear I almost forgot the sound of your voice." "If you long for my company, you know where to find me." She huffed, lowering her head. He continued. "Why would you want to remain on the surface when your subjects are below?" "Those are not my people. Our brothers and sisters have long parted with their nature. They've traded gifts for greed, cooperation for violence, and clever wit for quick satisfaction. What happened to the days of old, when we might make an honest bargain and share a bounty?" The Mistress, or Titania, as he had called her, ran her slender fingers through her shiny long hair in a gesture of desperation. "Mischief has always been our nature, lover. Trickery and chaos are the ways of this world. Nothing will change if there is no destruction. It is our purpose to bring misery just as well as mirth." "There is no mirth in this dark place!" The Lady's voice cut sharply through the cool night air. "The subjects you love have abandoned all that used to be sacred. They gorge themselves on the flesh of their brethren, lay hands on their own brood, and where they once sought beauty in the human race, if they find it now they defile it beyond recognition." The king had fallen silent. His wife was shaking, her shoulders quivering with both rage and anger. "We trade in the greed of others, Oberon, not in their innocence. We were meant to take from those who would seek to defraud others, not those who wanted only their day in the sun." It was these words that triggered the flood. My breath hitched, my eyelids started to feel heavy and seconds later, tears were streaming freely down my cheeks. The three others instantly gathered around me, Scout giving me a quick side-hug, Harley patting my arm and Van awkwardly offering me a torn handkerchief from his pocket. "What's wrong?" Scout asked. My sudden emotional outbreak had drawn the couple's attention. The king flashed me an angry glare, while the queen's eyes widened in sympathy. She asked me why I was crying, pretty much at the exact same moment as her husband told me to stop. "Exhibit A," Harley remarked under his breath. The Lady swept up to us and knelt down to get on eye level with me. "The dwarven king of faeries' empathy matches that of a donkey. Don't pay him any mind. Will you tell me what's troubling you?" I didn't quite know how to explain. Still, I tried to press out coherent sentences in-between sobs. "My best friend was taken underground by one of your, your . . . \*things\*. She's been gone for over a year now. I tried to go after her but somebody stopped me, and . . . and her kidnapper won't leave me alone, either. He has her and he's rubbing it in my face. He tells me about what he's--what he's doing to her. And that #8217;s who she was. What she was like. Her day in the sun. That #8217;s all she ever wanted. She gave it up to save me and I can #8217;t help her. #8221; Titania turned around to her husband with a knowing glare. Oberon, however, looked up and approached us. "Who? Who is the one who took her? Do you know his name?" I swallowed hard. And then I said it. I'm too afraid to write it out, even now. I'm surprised I even got it to leave my mouth. The Lady let out a deep, shaky sigh while her spouse growled. I heard Van let out a soft *fuck* when I said it, which was, you know, not at all comforting. "So you know?" Titania fixed Oberon with a glare. "Did you see them?" The king fell silent. "Did you see him with a human?" "Not a human. Not anymore," he began, looking down. "With the way he's mangled her you wouldn't think her for one even if she was. He counts her more a plaything than a person." I let out a loud sob and covered my face. I was going to wipe my eyes on my sleeve, but the only fabric on my arm was wrapped around the cut Harley #8217;d put in my skin, and when I snagged it I swore through my tears.  #8220;I #8217;ll kill the son of a bitch. I #8217;ll find a way back to him, and I #8217;ll kill him. #8221; I heard Van make some kind of quiet protest behind me, probably pointing out the relative insanity of saying that to the Queen, of all people, but when I looked up from my arm Titania was just shaking her head, her eyes full of regret.  #8220;It #8217;s a much harder task than you might imagine, little one, #8221; she told me.  #8220;There *are* ways to kill us . . . but it #8217;s no easy matter. The slow death we face when it comes is punishment, and there is nothing punishable in our world by death except a broken promise. He #8217;s old, and wily, and unlikely to make a contract broken easily enough to make himself vulnerable. But this is a double-edged weapon in your hands. You may not be able to kill him, but neither is it any easy task for him to kill her. And so if you seek him, you may be able to save her. #8221;  #8220;Bring her to me, #8221; Oberon rumbled.  #8220;There is no magic still possible that will return her to humanity. But she will find a home and safety in my court, far removed from his power. He will be unable to touch her . . . nay, even to approach her. Here she will find peace. Perhaps even joy. To me, he may not resist the making of a contract. Either he will keep his distance, or he will find the flesh melted from his body like wax from a candle and his bones broken like so many twigs under our feet. And then, mayhap, I might throw him to the swine, to make myself a better meal. They #8217;ll care not for his screams, and I should count them as music, for the offense he did me when first he pursued her. #8221; I nodded. Then I stopped. I #8217;d worked too closely for too long with his people, I guess.  #8220;How do I know that #8217;s true? I #8217;m not just throwing her from one awful situation into another? And I #8217;m not going to get one or both of us screwed over on a technicality? #8221; I thought he might get offended, but instead he just looked kind of . . . amused.  #8220;Our word is our bond, and none may break it, as my wife has said, #8221; he said.  #8220;It #8217;s true that had you approached for greed or selfish gain, I would seek every opportunity to make you repent a rash bargain. But you seek to help another, and such wrongs as she #8217;s committed are long since paid for. I make this offer without hidden condition, and in return expect only what I have asked. #8221; He looked up at Titania.  #8220;Is this why you sent such rare meats? The salvation of a lone lost waif? #8221; I gasped as I realized what I might have done.  #8220;No! No. No, I . . . . it #8217;s not even mine, I--I didn #8217;t mean--I #8217;m sorry, I wasn #8217;t-- #8221;  #8220;What he means, #8221; Scout cut in,  #8220;is that he #8217;ll find something else worth the trade to you. We #8217;ll help him. But the favor we want to ask is different. #8221; Oberon inclined his head toward us.  #8220;Then let us eat, and you may ask. #8221; Scout blinked at him.  #8220;Us? #8221;  #8220;The kill is yours, is it not? It #8217;s far too much for one. Nor does it keep. #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s an offering. For a favor, #8221; Harley tried. Oberon waved a hand.  #8220;And with few exceptions, you will find it granted. Join me. Unless you fear the old tales. #8221; Harley and Scout glanced between each other as Oberon settled himself next to the corpse. I scratched the back of my arm. It #8217;s funny--the cut was on the other side, but the itch was on the back. The whole body going *hey, stupid, you shouldn #8217;t have done that,* I guess. I #8217;ve noticed that before.  #8220;It #8217;s really kind of you, #8221; I said, finally, because somebody had to say *something.*  #8220;But Scout said once you eat it, you can #8217;t eat anything else except fruit and sugar. And I appreciate the offer, but I really like macaroni and cheese too much to give it up, no matter how good the meat is. #8221; Oberon let out a laugh--loud, and booming, and echoing, like it should fill a giant hall. Or a cavern.  #8220;Then keep your human food, and have joy of it, #8221; he said, and pulled a long knife from what I guessed must have been an inner pocket of his pants. Or something. The blade alone was as long as my hand, and looked like bone. He reached for the pigman #8217;s arm, and I tried not to gag watching him cut off a slice. It #8217;s not that I don #8217;t know where meat comes from, or even that I object to seeing it in a whole state. My dad had some hunter friends, and I #8217;ve had venison straight off the carcass. It #8217;s just that pigmen look like, well, other than the pig bits of course, like *people.* Also, it #8217;s worth noting that when I say  #8220;a slice, #8221; I mean  #8220;a very thick piece about six inches long, #8221; and then he disjointed his jaw like a snake, and then just . . . . swallowed it whole. Harley and Scout finally sat down across from him. Van joined them and pulled out a pocket utility knife. I just kind of stood under a tree being disturbed, which I think is a pretty healthy reaction to watching something that looks disturbingly like a man with no jawbone chowing down on a human arm. Titania put a hand on my shoulder.  #8220;Come, #8221; she said, and held out one of her free hands to indicate a path, a little way away from the strange feast.  #8220;Tell me about your friend. #8221; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I shook the water out of my hair and gave it one last rub with the towel. Harley and Scout between them had taken one look at me after the talk with Oberon was done--covered in pigman blood and my blood and old rotten fruit and mud--and suggested I borrow their shower. Harley lent me some clothes, too, and once I had some gauze wrapped around my arm I slipped into them. The shirt fit more like a dress and the jeans were only staying up by the grace of my cleaned-off belt and a pair of safety pins, but they were clean, and dry, and smelled of fabric softener and woodsmoke instead of rot and must. I did my best to roll up the sleeves and stepped out onto their porch. The night was clear and fresh. The twins' garden was lying calm in the silvery moonlight. Van had gone up to the porch and was leaning against one of the wooden pillars, resting his eyes. His black hair was still wet from the shower he'd taken before me. Harley was still somewhere inside. I looked around to find Scout on their old swing set, dreamily rocking back and forth while staring up at the dark sky. I walked by Van, slightly tapping my fingers on his shoulder in greeting so I wouldn't startle him, producing a tired, acknowledging grunt in return.  #8220;Hey. #8221;  #8220;Hm? #8221; I bit my lip. I should #8217;ve planned it out already, but I hadn #8217;t.  #8220;I . . . wanted to say thanks. #8221; Van opened his eyes and stared at me quizzically.  #8220;For what? #8221;  #8220;You could #8217;ve left Harley and me hanging out to the wind. Especially me. I don #8217;t have any connection to your family. But you kept looking out for us even when we didn #8217;t do the same for you. #8221; I paused and then held out my hand, trying not to be nervous. I haven #8217;t shaken hands in over ten years. And never with someone who isn #8217;t human.  #8220;I #8217;m sorry. For being so quick to judge you. #8221; He gave me a tired smile back and accepted my hand. I was a little afraid he was going to have one of those aggressive handshakes that makes you wonder if the guy should be in anger management, but he didn #8217;t.  #8220;Thanks for giving me the chance to prove you wrong. #8221; I made my way over to Scout. Looking up at me, she smiled, leaning her head against the swing's rope. Her eyes were faintly shimmering in the dim light and for a split second, I thought she was crying. "How are you?" I asked. "I'm #8230; I'm okay, I think. Just a little emotional. I didn #8217;t think he #8217;d agree to destroying Smiley so fast. And, well . . . you know." "Yeah, I know, #8221; I said. She was dealing with Eddie, still. And maybe a little bit with how the end of the feast had played out. Oberon hadn #8217;t waited to make good on his word--he #8217;d called the thing, and for a few seconds I think we all thought we were dead, but then he grabbed its shoulders in both hands and squeezed until there was this awful wet snap and its head fell forward. That wasn #8217;t the end, but it was the beginning of it. "Should I push you a little?" Her mouth opened in a surprised little "o" and she nodded eagerly, kicking her legs in anticipation. I chuckled and went up behind her, carefully pressing against her back and sending her swinging forward. She giggled a bit when I poked her side, and I felt a pang, thinking about someone else laughing a long time ago on a different ride. After a few minutes, I saw Harley appear in the doorway, and ducked out from behind Scout to go meet him. He met me halfway, somewhere between Van on the porch and Scout on the swing. "Time to go home?" he asked me. "Yeah. I should get going before I get too tired to drive." I saw Van get up and stretch his arms. "Looks like he's going, too." Harley hummed in agreement. "You should come by again. You, uh . . . it was nice having you with us. Okay, so--I don't know what happened to you, and you don't need to tell me. So maybe you're not comfortable around here. This whole thing could #8217;ve been hell for you and I wouldn't know, but you're always welcome here and Scout loves you anyways and . . . I don't know, I just kinda wanted to say that. I'd like to see you around some more." I smiled. "I'd like that. Thanks for the #8211;" And suddenly his arms were around me. His shoulders quivered ever so slightly. "I was scared shitless," he muttered. "You being here, and calming me down, it really helped, and . . . and I know it was so much harder for you, but thank you. For all of it." He pulled away before I could hug him back. "Thank you so, so much."  #8220;I #8217;m glad I could stumble around like an idiot and make you feel better. #8221;  #8220;It, uh. #8221; He turned so red his skin almost matched his hair.  #8220;It was kinda cute? #8221; I tried not to roll my eyes.  #8220;I guess I #8217;ll take cute over adorable. #8221; I hesitated a second, and then thought about smelling enchanted water on his clothes before pulling him back into the hug and stretching so I could reach his ear. Smiley was on its deathbed, Titania possibly watching and guarding even as we spoke, but that didn #8217;t mean anybody else needed to overhear.  #8220;You have a freckle on your right ear. That #8217;s how I could tell, when I met you first. But there #8217;s a scar on your collarbone she doesn #8217;t have, too. Just a little one. #8221; Harley stared at me as I let go. I raised my eyebrows at him. He took a single stunned step backward, then patted me on the shoulder and went back up to the porch. He exchanged a few words with Van, and they shook hands awkwardly before Harley returned inside. Scout had come up behind us and was now skipping up the steps to the porch as well. As I made my way over to my car, I heard her and Van talk in hushed voices. "So . . . that was something now. Are you okay?" he asked her. "Yes," she replied. I suppressed a snort. These two sounded just so awkward talking to each other. "Hey, um . . . I just wanted to thank you. You came up with this whole idea, so it's kinda thanks to you that we're just a little safer now. And I appreciate that." "No worries. At first this was kinda just for myself. Smiley wasn't . . . *exactly* a threat to me. Not gonna lie, I sorta . . . I just wanted revenge. I know that sounds super childish. But to be honest, the more I got to know your brother and you . . . okay, mainly you." His voice broke off and he let out a nervous chuckle. "I guess after finding out what happened with you and my dad I started feeling a little responsible for you somehow." "Oh." Scout sounded a bit strained. "There's . . . no need for that." "Yeah, I know." He chuckled. "You're fine on your own." "You're not your dad to me." "Not? I mean, no." He sounded surprised, but quickly caught himself. A short pause ensued, and I stayed still, hidden behind the corner of the house. "I might have seen him in you for a little while," she went on, sounding a bit embarrassed. "But, like #8230; I shouldn't have and I don't anymore. To be honest, you don't even look or feel like him now." "Is that a good thing?" "Yeah. I liked your dad, but he was a little mean sometimes. He was . . . a teacher to me, you know. Maybe a bit of a father figure too. But you're not." "What am I, then?" Van asked, his voice a warm kind of quiet. The only sound to leave her mouth was a croaky little *uh*. "Can I have your number, maybe?" Scout eventually asked, after clearing her throat. "Not to be a creep or anything but when I was in your kitchen, I kinda jotted it down and I put it on the fridge for you. Please don't stab me." Scout laughed, and that's all I really needed to hear. I went around and got into my car, pausing for a moment to appreciate the moon shining off the pavement, like a river made solid. The streets here are so empty at night. I don't know what to make of all this. My life #8217;s been pretty out of control for a while now, but for the first time in a long time, I actually felt pretty good. It's odd; I was off the impression that only normalcy could return me to a peaceful state of mind. But now, I #8217;ve witnessed a dispute between the King and Queen of faeries, met a spider who works as a mechanic, got incredibly close to a pair of creepy-at-first-glance twins and helped kill something that #8217;s half man and half pig and for some reason, I haven't felt as at ease as I do now for an eternity. With a sigh of relief, I reached down and turned on [the radio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having a weird issue with materials gained when scrapping cars. Please help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 12:47:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's entirely possible there's a perk I usually take that I haven't yet that fixes this, but I'm not sure.  #8203; So I'm running into an issue where, instead of giving me screws and nuclear material and whatever the other four or five items are that you usually get from scrapping a car, it's just giving me steel. Nothing else. Only steel.  #8203; At first I thought it might be because I downloaded a mod that injects more junk into the world (since many such mods seem to "rebalance" things in ways that are . . . not all that balanced actually), but I looked over the notes for that mod, and that doesn't seem to be the issue. The only thing the mod does is add more junk and make it so leveling the Scrapper perk produces more junk. I disabled it anyway, just to see, and it didn't fix the problem. This is the only relatively-new mod I have, and thus the only one I can think of that would cause the problem--which leads me to believe it's not a mod.  #8203; Do I need to level up enough to get the third level of the Scrapper perk to get more than steel out of my cars? Is there a different perk that lets you get more out of cars that I didn't realize does so, and which I possibly haven't gotten yet because I'm still relatively low-level on this playthrough? Has anybody else run into this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So here's the thing, especially because Twin Hunters brought new folks onto the sub who apparently want to read Stagecoach.  #8203; I *did not* like the original Chapter 18. I didn't like it when I posted it, I still don't like it. I thought the ending was weak, some of the middle portions were messy, and it felt vaguely stereotypey in a way I couldn't put my finger on. It got posted just a couple nights before I cut myself (*accidentally* jfc the number of people who asked me if I did it on purpose and wanted to hurt myself is *ridiculous* let the record show I'm not suicidal I'm just a dumbass who can't cut cheese right apparently), and I was already running low on steam from the whole "three weeks straight with no pauses" thing.  #8203; Not to put too fine a point on it, *the original version of Chapter 18 fucking sucks.*  #8203; Which is why after like an entire week of working on it, I would like to present the *new and improved* Chapter 18. Which includes a couple of things I cut because I was so fucking tired I forgot about them, an almost-entirely-different first half, some continuity fixes, and less-clunky dialogue.  #8203; [https://archiveofourown.org/works/24643165/chapters/62929759](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24643165/chapters/62929759)  #8203; ENJOY.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well yes, precisely. As you said #8212;each on its own, as a statement piece, sounds chic! Fashionable. It #8217;s like people who claim hijabis don #8217;t care about fashion. Of course they do. It just looks different than  #8220;and I can show THIS much boob before I get arrested. #8221; Any woman who has to think about her appearance insofar as  #8220;I need to cover my hair today #8221; is going to be thinking about her looks, even if it #8217;s in the sense of  #8220;how can I dress modestly #8221; rather than  #8220;how can I be sexy. #8221; (I #8217;m....just saying, I #8217;ve never seen a woman in a tichel AND old sweatpants, except when one of my friends was getting ready for shul and wasn #8217;t fully dressed yet.) Claiming otherwise does a disservice to both these women and to fashion in general. I think the one I #8217;m thinking of only exists in Israel. It #8217;s called Ultra-Orthodox, but there are some ultra-Orthodox who look at them and go  #8220;bro, calm down. #8221; (So basically they #8217;re coattailing on a name that doesn #8217;t actually describe them.) Very fringe, but it does exist. Either way, OP definitely has some issues, including the fact that he #8217;s trying to control this woman #8217;s behavior without leading by example.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m going to probably get tossed out on my ear for heresy, but screw it. I don #8217;t think G-d necessarily knows what we #8217;ll do next. I think he knows all that can currently be known. We see this in Torah, when he looks at the result of the flood and declares that it was evil and he won #8217;t do it again. He has learned from the experience. Thus: he knows all that can currently be known, which includes things far beyond our understanding. This is a very old example, but: in 1000CE, he knew what electricity was. He could probably deduce we #8217;d figure out how to use it. Did he know we #8217;d then turn around and invent the vacuum cleaner? Well....I #8217;m not so sure about that. We didn #8217;t understand electricity at all then. We didn #8217;t know it existed. He knew a lot more than we did, but that doesn #8217;t mean he knew exactly what we #8217;d do once we figured out how to use this tool.</TEXT>

I assure you, people saying "he tried to murder you, yes, but really all you had to do was not look in the freezer so it's kind of your fault" sounds chillingly similar to what I heard from my mother while I was being beaten until I had bruises. And it makes me question the mental health of people in the comments, to be quite honest. There is ZERO excuse for attempting to murder somebody because they made you mad. He isn't a victim anymore. He's made choices. He's fully aware they are not acceptable choices. He clearly doesn't even view other people as human. The best thing that could happen at this point is for him to be killed.</TEXT>

He has no remorse for committing two murders (okay, one didn't actually go through, but he didn't know that). He's apparently become a cannibal. He had no problem committing assault on two people, and while you *might* be able to argue that he had no choice, there's something quite chilling about him doing it without so much as a "sorry, guys, it's got to be done but you'll be okay" in his mind. At this point his reasoning doesn't matter. He's an abuser, a murderer, and a cannibal who's lost whatever human empathy he might once have had.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Incorrect. An insanity plea requires that the defendant be mentally incapacitated at the time the crime is committed in a way that prevents them from being capable of recognizing their actions are wrong. The fact that Phoenix hides his bodies shows he knows his actions are wrong. His halfhearted attempt at pretending he feels bad also shows this #8212;most people would feel badly because it #8217;s a terrible thing to do, so he will  #8220;feel badly. #8221; Also, the only symptom of schizophrenia he has is auditory hallucinations, and the fact that he #8217;s reactionary and violent actually speaks AGAINST a diagnosis of schizophrenia. While people with schizophrenia are prone to delusions of grandeur, they also usually see rejection from outside sources as an indication of something being wrong with them, not the other person. A schizophrenic is far, FAR more likely to harm themselves than another person. You #8217;re going off a very narrow, inaccurate Hollywood stereotype.</TEXT>

I have turrets placed near all attack spawn points for a total of 70-ish defense. \--no stores yet because I need more caps.  #8203;  #8203; If the internet doesn't lie to me, with their needs met settlers should be capable of achieving 80% happiness.

Colored Post-Its can also let you organize your commentary--for example, green for names to look up, yellow for personal insights, pink for verses you want to come back to, and blue for metatextual connections (for example, the story of the Flood bears a *strong* resemblance to the myth of Pyrrha of Thessaly).</TEXT>

The reason those videos were removed, and indeed are quite dangerous, is that they #8217;re easy for children and teens to find, which is an actual known recruiting tactic. Removing them was a way to try to stop indoctrination from the far right.

    <TEXT>I'm Reform and have heard this attributed to Hillel.  #8203; I strongly suspect it's one of those stories that was told so very, very long ago (if ever it was truly told at all) that it's misattributed to every rabbi and sage of note, in much the same way that "those who would sacrifice freedom for safety deserve neither" has had its wording a bit mashed about (the version I quoted just now is said mashed-about version) and is misattributed to JFK, Teddy Roosevelt, MLK, Abraham Lincoln . . . . . and actually the original was Benjamin Franklin. It's just that it's such an apt quote that everybody assumes Some Great Man Said It and picks the first one they think of.  #8203; So I suspect it is with this story. Who knows who first told it? Rashi? Hillel? One of the other sages or rabbis? (Jesus in a sermon that sure as hell didn't make it into the gospels?) The point is not who did the telling, but rather that it's an important thing to know and learn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So first of all, let's start here: you are not stupid and whoever said that needs a good slap or six across the face, and if I was there I would cheerfully do it for you. I'm 32, I don't have time for that kind of nonsense anymore.  #8203; Moving on: the mitzvot are set up in such a way that they are meant not to cause an undue burden. (That's why the Amidah is only recited in its entirety on Yom Kippur--it's *so long* that doing it every week, or every day for some movements, put an undue burden on those who could not easily stand.) Or, as it was put to me in my conversion class: "say you keep full kosher, and you're dying of thirst and starvation in a desert. A random traveler comes by and recognizes you from the missing person description. The traveler says 'thank goodness I found you! Let's get you to a hospital. Here, take my lunch, you need it' and their lunch is a ham and swiss with a thermos of milk. It is in the spirit of the mitzvot that you say 'G-d, thank you for sending me sustenance, that I may live another day' and you eat the ham and swiss and you drink the milk *and you don't feel guilty for it.* This is the meal G-d has sent you to help you live."  #8203; If keeping certain mitzvot is causing you physical or mental harm, *you are not supposed to keep those mitzvot.* The exception to this, of course, is murder--you can't murder for any reason, including because you get sad when you can't murder. (I strongly doubt that's your problem, though.)  #8203; Next: It sounds like you're either Orthodox, or--as so many teens are, as I was when I was your age--you're a total zealot who means to do this Jewish thing All The Way, All The Time, To Be The Very Best Of Jews. That path is not for everyone. (It certainly wasn't for me.) For some people it works great! For others, it can be a source of pain and anguish. It was for me (I tried to kill myself over it), and it sounds like it might be for you. (If you feel like you're in danger of hurting yourself, please text HOME to 741-741.) Consider talking to your rabbi (mine is currently doing appointments by phone), doing some reading on other movements, maybe even looking up some other rabbis online and telling them you're having some difficulty with practice right now and could use some insight. No rabbi is going to be upset at a young person trying to find a way to make their Judaism their own.  #8203; Finally: if you *are* Orthodox, I don't want to sit here and go "you're doing it wrong! Do it my way instead!" (I'm Reform. That is *not* what we're about.) But I *would* suggest doing some reading about other movements, including Modern Orthodox. You may find that another movement works better for you. You may also find that having the outside context for your own movement gives you a greater and better understanding, and allows you greater comfort in the path you're already on! I pray you'll find the path that works for you as you seek to lead a Jewish life and continue your journey in Judaism. Best of luck.</TEXT>

Yeah, that sure isn't treating a woman like she's filthy just for being a woman. She was sick with a deadly disease, for fuck's sake. *He left her to die.* As for the burning rather than giving to a woman, here, have some Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud (JT) notes the opinion of Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, the Tanna mentioned above:  #8220;Women #8217;s wisdom is solely in the spindle. #8221; He added,  #8220;The words of the Torah should be burned rather than entrusted to women #8221; (JT *Sotah* 3:4, 19a).

    <TEXT>My problem is that I see this carried out in action in Orthodoxy. For example, I attended a Chabad for one service because my mom had a friend whose son was becoming bar mitzvah. The women sat upstairs. During standing prayer everyone took a step back so nobody was in a line of sight to see the Torah. I #8217;d glanced into the men #8217;s section on my way in, just to see what it looked like (I have yet to be in a synagogue of any movement that isn #8217;t absolutely stunning), and I was told later by one of the men that it was against G-d for me to have done it because the Torah was out of the Ark. One of the Jewish blogs I follow on Tumblr linked an article about a year ago written by a woman who #8217;d left Orthodoxy. I don #8217;t remember much of it, but one quote stuck out and stuck with me: that as a child she was told she was very smart and would bear wonderful sons to study Torah. She, however, wasn #8217;t allowed to even read a printed version at home. So yeah! This quote absolutely does get followed. There #8217;s no question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Re: your last paragraph, I didn #8217;t even think of that. I attended an Orthodox service for a family friend becoming bar mitzvah and although I was still barely learning the Alef bet, the Tefillah and....the one that immediately follows it, I forget the name of it but it ends with  #8220;Baruch atah Adonai, m #8217;chayei hakol, #8221; were the only two I could actually follow without a transliterated prayerbook. It #8217;s also possible that my rabbi was giving a simplified explanation based on what #8217;s in the siddurim. He was explaining this on YK itself, which is long enough without adding an hour on the history of the Amidah. (Although....the history of the prayers would make an EXTREMELY interesting class....) I suspect you #8217;re right, and the difference in movements is causing the confusion here. It #8217;s also possible that it #8217;s due to my synagogue being rather small #8212;we used to do Saturday morning and Tuesday services, and cut out both because we couldn #8217;t even make a minyan. (Even though Reform counts women in the minyan!) Given the difficulty some of our older congregants face in getting there even one day a week, I #8217;m kind of not surprised. Anyway, what I meant to say is the only one I #8217;m familiar with is the Friday night Amidah, all of which I #8217;m pretty sure is in the YK Amidah.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OKAY SO. I promised I would return when I actually had the wherewithal to type an entire novel. Here we go. I originally came from a legit evangelical Christian cult. The charismatic mind-reading leader, the iron-clad rigid thou-shalt-nots, the suicide orders for those of us who happened to be queer. (As you may guess, I failed. I'm quite happy about that these days.) I started *severely* questioning after an incident involving the church straight-up ignoring my medical history, because I guess "you're possessed by demons" makes more sense than "you have inner-ear tissue scarring from high fever as a child." (Yes, even the suicide attempt didn't dissuade me. When I say cult I mean *cult.*) Now for the part that's going to shock everybody and I'm going to ask that you read to the end before going "ABSOLUTELY NOT, BANNED." *My journey into Judaism started with the Messianics.* At this point in my life, I didn't know a Torah from a piece of toast and had no idea what Messianic history was. I just knew there was a synagogue right by my grandfather's house, and my Jewish uncle was sick to the point of dying, and there were people praying in churches and Hindu temples and who knows where else all over the world but not one single person had thought to ask a synagogue to pray. So I called this Messianic "synagogue," knowing nothing except that they were Jews and therefore Not Like People I Was Used To, and told them about my uncle, and they invited me to come pray. So that Saturday morning, I did. Before the service began, I was talking to one of the congregants and we started talking Scripture. At this point in my life, that was pretty much the only thing I knew how to talk about. So this lady quoted something from . . . . I forget where, might've been Torah might've been part of the Christian bible, it really doesn't matter. What matters is what happened next. I said "What about X verse in Y?" And then immediately covered my mouth and said "I'm so sorry." She looked puzzled and asked me why I was sorry. I replied, in a way I assume probably sounded *extremely* creepy and programmed to an outsider, "because you must never question Scripture or you speak with Satan's tongue. It's blasphemy." The Messianics might be Christians, but they at least pay lip service to some Jewish ideals, and whatever thought just went through your head reading that sentence is probably pretty close to what I saw on this woman's face. And she angrily replied--clearly not angry *at me*, but at whoever had taught me that sentence--"why *shouldn't* you question Scripture? We're *commanded* to question Scripture! Any faith that won't stand up to question is a weak faith!" And, well, I decided to start asking questions at my church. And then their whole story fell apart like a house of cards. And then I went adrift for awhile. Eventually I stumbled into paganism, and I do mean "stumbled." I knew I believed in *something* but had no idea what, and the concept of a nature-based religion--what might be called a *science*\-based religion, since it relied on observation of seasons--appealed to me after half a blistering, burning decade in a cult that once said loud, laying-on-of-hands prayers over me because the pastor said we should all trace our genes back to Adam and Eve and I said "but wouldn't any genealogy records have been destroyed in the Flood?" (Yes, we were *really actually expected* to be able to trace literal, actual family trees back to Adam and Eve. And if we felt unable it was a show of lack of faith, not the practicalities of "no records" and "lack of literacy in early civilizations.") Logic! I craved it! . . . . but it felt hollow. It's great for some people. It wasn't for me. In the meantime, I lived with my sister for awhile, helping to take care of my nieces. She's also a Jewish convert, and we're ten years apart in age, so she was already well into The Whole Jew Thing (you know, member of the synagogue, kids in Hebrew school, picking up Yiddish from her elders, mother-in-law who plays mahjong and a play Shabbat set for the tiny ones . . .). And I spent a year and a half seeing a Jewish household from the inside. And something happened: because she was my sister, it wasn't Different And Strange. It was just her way of living. And I started to fall in love with the community, and the idea that any question I wanted to ask, *someone would answer.* Eventually I moved away. And then somehow I fell directly into a bunch of Jewish blogs on Tumblr. And I do mean "somehow" and I do mean "fell." I have no idea how I got there. But suddenly I was *surrounded* by Jewish community again. Digital Jewish community, but still. And I felt like a hole in my heart was being filled. . . . . . and then I witnessed a whole bunch of said Tumblr Jews having a full-on Talmudic argument about whether or not vampires could keep kosher. Because somebody wanted to know for a book they were writing. By the time this argument was over there were seventeen people involved (including a rabbi), one person had actually called their own rabbi in real life for answers, I'd discovered that Jewish holy books did not end at Torah and included both Tanakh and Talmud (and several of the people involved, all of whom had different opinions, were quoting these books extensively at each other to back up their arguments), and to my incredible shock and surprise . . . . the real-life rabbi, the one who probably didn't know what fanfiction was and simply had this question posed to him as "so hypothetically if vampires existed . . . . ", *wrote a responsa for this person's vampire story.* (The answer, by the way, as per this rabbi, is that vampires can keep kosher if the state of undeath is considered a form of life, but it requires a *very* stringent set of conditions to be met.) And that was when I knew. I knew I wanted to be part of a community that could ask questions like that and get real answers. Is it ridiculous? Completely. Is it practical in any sense of the word? Not a bit, unless you're a Jewish author trying to write a story about Jewish vampires and werewolves, I guess. But when I confessed this to the rabbi I eventually spoke to about conversion--that this moment, this *stupid nonsensical completely inconsequential moment*, was the arrow-shot to the heart that I wanted to be a Jew--he started laughing and then asked if I remembered any of the portions of Talmud that were quoted, because it was a very interesting question. And so, very logically, I sat on that conclusion for a year and a half. Because I had a highly dysfunctional childhood that included my mother pitting my sister and I against each other, and I was still trying to learn how to deal with that, and I didn't want my sister to think I was converting just to copy her. I was sharing these woes with a friend who's a Jehovah's Witness while we were out thrifting ( . . . . does anybody think this story is made up at this point? I've never typed it all out before and I'm starting to realize how completely and utterly fake it sounds if you don't know it's true), because she's a convert from Methodist to JW and I thought she might have some insight. We were trawling the book section to add to my Stephen King collection as I poured out my heart to her and all of a sudden she said "Nina, do you need one of these?" and passed a book over the top of the rack. Based on the size and the color, I thought at first it might be a copy of The Shining. . . . . . it was a Torah. And no, I am not joking. Or bullshitting. She handed me a G-d's-honest Torah. I know a divine two-by-four when it slaps me upside the head and yells HEY STUPID LOOK AT THE NEON SIGN, so I called my sister and told her what we'd found, and why I was conflicted, and how my heart felt, and said "what should I do?" Her response: "I can't tell you one way or the other. We don't proselytize. But I think your next step should be calling a rabbi." So I did. A dozen books, a million questions, a significant portion of [myjewishlearning.com](https://myjewishlearning.com) and a year and a half later, I held the Torah in my arms and declared myself part of Am Yisrael. I've never regretted it for a moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, so.  #8203; I'm religious, but Reform. I have plans to get a tattoo of my own--not just a tattoo, but a tattoo *in Talmudic Hebrew.* I'm getting a rainbow watercolor tattoo with a semicolon and the word ** #1492; #1460; #1504; #1461; #1468; #1469; #1504; #1460; #1497;** , "hineini," meaning "here I am." Not just any "here I am," though--it's the one used by Abraham and Moses when G-d calls out to them. If you know the meaning of the semicolon tattoo, you can probably figure out why I've chosen this word, and why putting it on my body feels like a direct call out to G-d--much as the patriarchs did. There's also a great deal of disagreement on the prohibition. You can read a bit about it [here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/fashion/17SKIN.html)  #8203; I think the most important thing in approaching a religious-based tattoo is to choose your artist carefully. I'm taking my time and searching for an artist who can 1) do watercolor tattoos and 2) I am confident can tattoo the Hebrew 10000% correctly. I won't select an artist who openly offers hateful tattoos (somebody living in my area has a professionally-done Iron Eagle and I could seriously slap whoever did it). If I'm putting this forever on my skin--especially in a visible place-- it will be done right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said what I said. This behavior has been rampant across the Orthodox community since COVID began. One miscontextualized quote does not change the COVID crisis in the Brooklyn Orthodox community that began because the Orthodox refused to listen to health regulations and continued to gather to daven. It doesn #8217;t change that long-term experiments on COVID are now happening in the Orthodox community BECAUSE SO MANY ORTHODOX CAUGHT COVID BY DISREGARDING HEALTH GUIDELINES. It does not change that the spread in Orthodox communities was so rapid and wildfire that collections were being taken up for tallitot to bury them in. Is it the whole Orthodox community? No. There are, I assume, Orthodox people out there who are using basic common sense. If memory serves, there was a rather prominent Orthodox rabbi who basically said  #8220;stay home and daven there, we #8217;ve had to do it in worse times, and let #8217;s just thank G-d it #8217;s an illness rather than another Hitler, because one of those things cannot be avoided by washing your hands. #8221; (Which I think is a pretty levelheaded way of approaching the situation.) I #8217;m paraphrasing more casually than he actually put it, but the main thrust of what he said is all there. These are not the Orthodox to whom I refer when I say I #8217;d like to take a chunk of the community and bang their heads into a wall while screaming PIKUACH NEFESH. If you #8217;re davening at home and wearing your mask, thank you for doing your part, may G-d bless and keep you and yours safe during this terrible time, and, yes, let #8217;s be grateful it #8217;s an illness we can fight rather than a genocidal dictator we can #8217;t. But if you show blatant disregard for life? Yeah, if you claim to be the only  #8220;true Jews #8221; because you follow all of halacha, *but you ignore pikuach nefesh*, then yes, I do in fact want to knock your head against something until the message sinks into your thick skull that YOU ARE IGNORING HALACHA. (The general you, not you-you.) The reason the report wasn #8217;t totally laughed off in the first place is because this attitude *is* common in some Orthodox communities. So yeah #8212;I said what I said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, but consider. In the time that was written, both men and women wore robes. In much of the Middle East and Africa, there are still men #8217;s robes and draped robelike garments. In traditional Japanese dress, the hakama (a kind of tied pants worn over a kimono) aren #8217;t segregated by gender but rather are seen as appropriate wear to show one is a scholar or professor. In the western world, we have different cuts of T-shirt for men and women (the  #8220;babydoll #8221; cut is meant to better accommodate the bust), but T-shirts are considered a gender neutral item and there are certainly unisex shirts that can be worn equally by men and women. So by whose standard do we define  #8220;male #8221; and  #8220;female #8221; clothing? Using the standard of dress found in Torah, any woman not wearing the equivalent of a niqab is immodest, and a man wearing a scarf because it #8217;s cold outside is in  #8220;women #8217;s dress. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given the low number of Jews in Japan, I don #8217;t think so. There are, however, a couple of VERY antisemitic anime #8212;Axis Powers Hetalia is obvious, but a lot of people don #8217;t realize SnK/Attack on Titan was written by a nationalist who admires Hitler. There are many antisemitic themes in the work. With that said, there #8217;s a scene in The Wind Rises (a Hayao Miyazaki film of all things!) that deals with antisemitism from a Japanese perspective. The main character travels to Germany in 1938 to observe German planes, as he #8217;s an airplane designer and wants to learn to make better planes. The scene can be dated to 1938 precisely because when the character is leaving an airplane hangar there #8217;s the sound of shattering glass, and then a man being chased across the bottom of the frame by two other men #8212;a reference to Krystallnacht. It was shocking to me in that it #8217;s just....there. Not condemned, not celebrated, just fact. It happened. End of story. I think possibly seeing it that way was even more of a gut-punch than if it #8217;d been dealt with directly. I #8217;d also suggest that if you #8217;re looking for anime that deal with themes of antisemitism that aren #8217;t necessarily antisemitism-specific, Trigun is a good watch (and it #8217;s one of the only anime where I feel comfortable saying  #8220;dub or sub, take your pick, they #8217;re both excellent #8221;). It deals with being misunderstood, being an outsider in one #8217;s own community, being seen as a hateful danger when all you want to do is be left in peace, living as a wanderer, and also some weighty philosophical questions. (If you read this and then go watch the first episode and go  #8220;.....wtf, were you trolling me? #8221; The answer is no. The tone of the series changes RAPIDLY across its 26 episodes, and there #8217;s a lot of philosophy buried in the slapstick of the first few episodes.)</TEXT>

I work Saturday nights until 3am, then have to be at work again at 3pm on Sunday. How am I supposed to go to a class I can #8217;t afford only five hours after I get home from a 12-hour shift? I can #8217;t join a committee for the same reason and can #8217;t go to general board meetings because you guessed it.

    <TEXT>This is going to sound clunky as all get-out, but hopefully it #8217;ll still make sense: So what you might say is that in a broader sense, the commandment is put in the context of whatever specific society is interpreting it at the time? Like if at some point in the far future it became the case that 99% of men wore only skirts, and 99% of women wore only pants, the rabbis might rule that jeans are frum but a dress is not?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sadly, I see quite a lot of this, not just  #8220;a few. #8221; Tonight I was harassed via messages by an Orthodox member of this sub who was grilling me about my conversion and actively referred to converts as  #8220;that sort #8221; while refusing to refer to them/us as Jews. When I pointed out that halacha forbids this behavior, they asked  #8220;why would you appeal to halacha when you don #8217;t believe in halacha? #8221; Apparently what I do or don #8217;t do determines whether or not they #8217;re required to follow halacha in regard to how they treat me. At this point it #8217;s more like I #8217;m pleasantly surprised when someone from the Orthodox community isn #8217;t an asshole. My OVERWHELMING experience is that that isn #8217;t the case. Or put another way: I #8217;m quite surprised to find out you #8217;re Orthodox, because your answers have been thoughtful, level, and even where we disagree, not nasty or backhanded.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like to think not, but after awhile the negative feedback just . . . starts to add up, you know? It hurts, it makes you angry. Like, I'm Jewish enough that I've been threatened by Neo-Nazis. I'm Jewish enough that I get the kike jokes at work. I'm Jewish enough for antisemites. But apparently I'm not Jewish. Because of some arbitrary line in the sand drawn by one group that's set itself up to be the arbiters of everyone else. I get shit on by both sides and it's like . . . shit, you'd think the group that talks about being shit on all the time *would understand and not roll that shit downhill.* All it does is create further division. I'd be far more open to working with a community that doesn't think I'm some kind of mentally ill abomination than one that does . . . *that.* . . . . . sorry. Between these two things I REALLY have some raw open nerves tonight. On a less "well, I'm sitting here trying not to cry" note, what's a BT? I feel like I've seen that abbreviation before, but only in a medical setting, and there it had something to do with blood tests. I'm guessing that's not what you're referring to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Pssst. Just a friendly note. The hyphen isn't necessary. Trans and cis are adjectives, just like tall, blonde, friendly, etc. So trans woman, cis man.) Maybe it's different to me because I'm genderqueer, but there is absolutely a difference. I have a friend who's a trans guy and we met in person before he was able to get approved for his hormone therapy. It's a Whole Big Thing involving psychiatrists and medical doctors and etc. etc. etc., because of another Whole Big Thing involving the history of anti-queer bias in medicine, and we don't have time to go down that rabbit hole. So let's leave it at "I met him in person before he was able to get approved for his hormone therapy." His style of dress is pretty unisex--he does the tee-shirts-and-sweatpants thing--and at the time he had something that couldn't decide if it was an emo haircut or a mullet, but either way: long. But he FELT male--and I don't mean "he told me he felt like a man inside," I mean that standing beside him felt like standing next to a man. There was absolutely a vibe. I couldn't understand why people kept calling him she. At one point his boyfriend said something about his birth control and I went " . . . . why does he need birth control you're gay" and his boyfriend cracked *up* because I literally forgot he was trans. I don't see how anyone could mistake a girl in boys' clothes for a trans man, simply because of that vibe. And vice-versa--you *feel* it. You really do.</TEXT>

(I like doing mine with chicken.) you want to talk items that sound similar but actually taste TOTALLY DIFFERENT, you #8217;ll be stunned. We could have had this. Instead no pizzas and a thick quesadilla.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suspect part of it also relates to the fact that FGM is often called "female circumcision." When in fact, true "female circumcision"--that is, removing the part of the vulva that would correspond with the tissue of the penile foreskin--would mean removing the outer labia. FGM instead cuts off the clitoris and sews shut the vagina, which would be roughly the equivalent of cutting off the head of the penis and then sewing the foreskin over the wound.  #8203; If FGM were called out for what it is, instead of euphemistically referred to as what it emphatically is *not,* the furor over male circumcision would probably abate some.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Salaam Alaykum  lt;3  #8203; So for your Q amp;A panel, I'd suggest actually having two rabbis (one Orthodox and one Conservative or Reform), and in addition to the priest, see if you can find a non-Lutheran minister. (The Lutherans aren't Catholics, but they're a lot closer to Catholicism ideologically than, say . . . the Methodists.)  #8203; As for movies, toward Holocaust Remembrance Day I'd suggest that Schindler's List is a good introduction to what the Holocaust was actually like. It treats the subject with dignity and respect and doesn't feel the need to shoehorn in "love stories" between Nazis and Jews or sad little goyische children (looking at you, Boy in the Striped Pajamas).  #8203; Further: consider doing health packs for the homeless. Right now especially, they're really hurting. Items that are often overlooked in homeless charity but are *desperately* needed include menstrual products, diapers, socks, and underwear. You may also consider asking people to donate books; one of the leading causes of drug addiction among the homeless population is that there's literally nothing to pass the time, it's mind-numbingly lonely and frightening and boring, you're constantly being dehumanized, and a little pill or powder will make it all go away for awhile. Providing a good book will help to provide enrichment and something to alleviate that boredom and loneliness. You might also consider passing out masks, which homeless people may be hard-pressed to come by.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to come down on either side here, but I would like to gently point out that I can think of one reason why. I grew up in an evangelical Christian cult. It took A LOT for me to step into Judaism, even though my values and theological beliefs lined up with it almost 100%. It meant facing a lot of old trauma, questioning the relationship with G-d that I #8217;d had to that point, and asking if I was ready or even able to say  #8220;yes, I can accept a religious community. #8221; If you #8217;ve never come out of that kind of religious trauma, you can #8217;t really understand it. Even after almost fifteen years, it still colors how I look at sex, learning, the authority of clergy, even how others practice. (I often have to remind myself that it #8217;s between every Jew and G-d how they practice, and that the judgment so welcome in the church has no place in the Jewish faith.) Have I left Christianity behind? Oh, yeah. But did it leave a lot of scars that I still have to deal with and work through? Oh. YEAH. Not everybody can overcome that kind of trauma. Some may not even want to #8212;they #8217;d rather just leave it all behind. I don #8217;t know that this is the case with OP #8217;s SO. But it is a way in which I can see someone feeling their identity would be erased by throwing in their lot as a religious person.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-17 22:44:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so. You guys know those scam calls that are like  #8220;this is Card Services calling about your card #8221; or  #8220;this is Social Security Administration #8221; or whatever, and they #8217;re always implying criminal activity on your account but you can get it cleared by handing over your card numbers or wiring money? Yeah. So I like keeping those people on the line, because the longer they #8217;re dealing with me, the less time they have to find some woman in her 80s who #8217;s terrified of losing everything. Also it might be mean, but it #8217;s fun to screw with people when you know they #8217;re bad actors. Anyway, if you keep these people on the phone long enough, sooner or later they #8217;ll say  #8220;G-d bless you, #8221; which in an American setting is....big nope. Now I have no problem with this if it #8217;s not being done in a smarmy Xtian superiority kind of way, but we #8217;re talking about screwing with scammers here. And I #8217;m wondering. Given that the unforgivable sin against G-d is to deny Him, would I be doing something awful by replying  #8220;I #8217;m an atheist? #8221; Keep in mind I feed these people the biggest lines of bullshit in history, including telling them my home phone number is 877-382-5633 (877 is toll free, 382-5633 spells  #8220;FUCK OFF #8221; on a keypad) and that I need to know which Social Security number they #8217;re talking about because I have four of them, so  #8220;I #8217;m an atheist #8221; would be one more thing in a long string of nonsense. Am I in the clear? Or should I find a different ridiculous thing to reply with?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would love to know why I #8217;ve been mocked for this. The specific thing I #8217;m thinking of is someone asking me why I supported the DREAM Act, and me saying there is no other commandment in Torah more commonly repeated than that we should be kind to the stranger/vulnerable among us. (The Mitzvah varies depending on the verse, some say widows, some say strangers, etc. but the commandment itself is always  #8220;be kind to the ______ among you, as you were once strangers in Egypt. #8221;) I was asked why that should matter to me since  #8220;you don #8217;t follow mitzvot anyway. #8221; As for the kosher butcher....I KNOW there #8217;s one around here. There must be. We have an erev near downtown, for Pete #8217;s sake. But the key phrase there is  #8220;if I could find. #8221; The only one I #8217;ve  #8220;found #8221; apparently converted to a kosher restaurant about 15 years ago. As for how that comes up? Very simple: discussions of factory farming. I often recommend to people that if they can find a kosher or halal butcher, the meat will be well-raised and humanely slaughtered. (Halal uses different blessings of course, but the  #8220;quick and painless and without stress #8221; part is basically identical.) In the course of such conversations it #8217;s totally natural to say  #8220;I know they can be tough to find, but it #8217;s worth the extra money if you can. If I could find one within a hundred miles of me that #8217;s the only kind of meat I #8217;d eat. #8221; I also hang out on Tumblr, where people may ask questions because they #8217;ve never met a Jew in person. So for example I might find myself saying  #8220;there are a lot of levels of kashrut, ranging from  #8216;I don #8217;t eat pork #8217; to  #8216;I have two completely separate kitchens, one for meat and one for dairy, and nothing from one ever touches the other, EVER, #8217; and as you can imagine there #8217;s a whole lot of ground to cover between those two. I keep kosher in the way you #8217;re probably most familiar with, by not eating pork or shellfish. #8221; And no, I don #8217;t go around screaming when I #8217;m on my period, unless I need to ask a coworker if I can borrow a tampon. The point is, if I were to follow Torah to the letter, I #8217;d be standing up for three days straight every month and cleaning my bathroom every time I had to pee. That #8217;s ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course I understand that. One of the most heartbreaking images I #8217;ve ever seen in my life was when my sister #8217;s synagogue was flooded during Hurricane Harvey. The video they took to showcase the damage for a  #8220;please help we need A LOT of money #8221; appeal panned over this whole row of boxes labeled  #8220;to be buried #8221; and my heart just tore. They were  #8220;only #8221; siddurim #8212;I think if any of their Torot had been in those boxes I would have started sobbing #8212;but I am incredibly aware of the custom, and why it #8217;s important. My shul has one of the Holocaust Torot, and we undertook a MASSIVE research effort to repair damage to it because we didn #8217;t want to have to bury it but it #8217;s just so old and parchment is, well, organic, and the age damage was extensive. (We succeeded! The repairs went well and it #8217;s still a kosher scroll.) But I still don #8217;t understand what this has to do with anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see I'm going to have to be hyper-specific and hyper-literal here.  #8203; So you asked why I would be mocked for keeping mitzvot. I shared an example with you of a time this happened: I was discussing the DREAM Act with some people and was asked why I supported it. I cited Torah, because my actual answer would be "basic human decency" but snark is rarely a good way to change minds. The part of Torah I cited is the commandment to be kind to strangers/the oppressed, and is one I do my best to live by. While the verses would originally have been something like "yo, not all people in Israel/Canaan/Judea are Jews, and you need to treat those people well. Remember when you were treated terribly? Did you like it? Yeah, don't do that," I feel like the concept itself could easily be applied elsewhere. Indeed, we do so, through the concepts of chesed and tzedakah. In this particular case, we have a group who were brought here as children, often fleeing hardship and/or oppression. Now this group is being told "go to a place you don't know, where you've never been, far from your home and family, because blah blah something something papers. You might die five minutes after you go there, but too bad." I argued that it is a mitzvah to help these people. Then I was told that I don't follow all the mitzvot anyway, so why do I care.  #8203; As a sidenote, please explain how some verses can be "loaded with meaning" but others you just take at face value, and how you know which is which. Because it strikes me as awfully convenient, some of the verses that get taken at face value.  #8203; I live in Phoenix. I know there's a kosher butcher here, but when I've tried to find them, what comes up is a place that has a little Jewish grocery up front (but no meat), and a kosher restaurant out back. The closest actual-kosher-butcher I've found is in Tucson. If you can figure out where the kosher butcher is here, you'd be doing me a great service, because Google keeps sending me to Segal's and I love Segal's but it is not a butcher anymore. I'd like to stick to kosher meat both because of halacha and because of a personal commitment to sustainable and human animal husbandry. I doubt Tarfon had dismantling factory farming in mind when he said "you are not expected to complete the work, but neither may you desist from it," but as far as I'm concerned, it applies. (Which sort of goes with this whole cool concept my rabbi did a series of sermons on, about how you can take a whole ton of the laws in Torah and apply modern science to them and go "huh, this is literally actually the best way to do this for science reasons," but that's a whole other post.)  #8203; As for Tumblr: the whole concept of the site is that various people can talk to each other. So I'll answer a question, other people may chime in to agree or disagree, etc. I don't mind this. I love answering questions, not just about Judaism but about any random thing I might have answers to. But you asked how the subject of keeping kosher would come up. There is your answer: someone asked and I explained it. And, of course, somebody who was Orthodox just had to chime in to tell me how I was treif. I'm not entirely sure why you find it so unbelievable that people ask questions.  #8203; As for the concept of standing up for three days straight--perhaps my fault for using hyperbole. But the line is literally in Torah: anything a menstruating woman sits on is unclean. One of my roommates is male. I don't think he'd enjoy being told he couldn't sit on the couch because I watched a movie while I was waiting for my cramps to abate. You may say "well it doesn't apply to him because he's not Jewish," and okay, for *my specific situation*, you would be correct. But what if he was? Then what? I stay in my room until I stop bleeding? I don't eat at the table? Yes--that *is* pretty ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Moshe also got denied entrance into Canaan because he disobeyed G-d, and had to repent for destroying the tablets of the Commandments. Like I'm not saying the Israelites were doing the right thing here, I'm just pointing out that saying "Moshe did it" is not exactly an argument. And that friend used to be Orthodox. She left the movement because she said all it taught her was to hate herself for being a woman. Not exactly a ringing endorsement of "upholding standards," I gotta tell you. A significant number of the women in my shul say the exact same thing. Many of us keep quite a lot of the mitzvot but don't consider ourselves lesser than men, and thus the fleeing of the Orthodox movement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I literally just told you an Orthodox person in the conversation said that to me. Why are you driving me in circles? As for Jews not being the government--you are correct, but we can vote. We can organize. We can donate. We can try to influence our government to do things that are correct, even if they're not technically "halacha" by the time they reach the government level. (If I don't eat pork, that's halacha. If I convince Kyrsten Sinema not to eat pork, that's a dietary choice.) Thus, I feel it is my duty to do exactly that--to influence things toward what is correct, even if I can't do it entirely by myself. Going back to that Tarfon quote again, because to me it is always relevant--I can't fix the immigration system all by myelf, but I can work on it. I can't do the work of fixing the whole world, but I can shoulder my part. As for everything having a deeper meaning . . . yes, I'm going to beat this horse again. If that's true, then why have I been told (yes, by Orthodox people) that it's a "secular view" or "Reform nonsense" when I offer up some of the interpretations I've heard of Lev. 18:22? The most common of these interpretations is that "toevah" is a kind of ritual forbiddenness--as in "okay, you guys are partners, great, fine, whatever. But when you come into the Temple, you don't try to perform sex magic. You don't take part in pagan rituals. You make the sacrifices G-d has asked for, and you pray. Partaking in the sex magic rituals of other cultures is forbidden." But nope--apparently there is no deeper meaning behind that verse. I have been told this multiple times. It is what it is what it is and there is *no* interpretation. So explain to me why that is.  #8203; I'll grant you that your explanation of the niddah rules here sounds at least mostly reasonable. (Insofar as I think basing anything other than "please wear a sanitary product" on menstruation is reasonable.) But as you say yourself, this would be different if the Temple were rebuilt, and the idea that you shouldn't be able to sleep in the same bed because of a bit of blood is ridiculous.  #8203; . . . . . . okay, hold up, hold up. Leaving behind my complaints for a moment. I haven't been to Israel because I'm broke as a joke and when you can't afford a $300 car repair you certainly can't afford a $3000 trip, but . . . . isn't the Western Wall on the Temple Mount? Like . . . . that was literally part of the Temple, wasn't it? How on earth are people holding services and praying there? My sister's been multiple times and she's prayed there.  #8203; Also not to sound like I'm noping out of a conversation, because I'm not. But it's 4:30am, I have to be up at 10 to go get a tire replaced, and then it's moving day for me and I have to have all my stuff into the new place by sundown so I can light candles. My boss might have forced me to work on Saturday but I will \*not\* miss the beginning of the holiday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've tried to convince her to at least come to a Reform service and see the difference in how women are treated. Unfortunately, she's been very badly scarred by her experiences as a child and a young adult. I'm not even entirely sure she's not an atheist who's sort of . . . . clinging to the idea of paganism because she's got to believe in *something.* She literally got angry with me for having a bat mitzvah ceremony. Not because "women shouldn't do that" but because "you're upholding the study of oppression." The anger and hurt I get back is just . . . impenetrable. I assure you I have tried. But I did so with hope, not judgment. What I'm left with is the ability to mourn that I don't think she's ever going to actually have any kind of connection with G-d at all. It was stolen from her and she's very angrily turned her back on whatever might have remained. This is the damage done by an ironclad and unforgiving sect that wanted her to be a shadow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem! Watch out for Jack Link #8212;some of theirs do, some don #8217;t. Slim Jim all uses pork.

    <TEXT>Depends on why it #8217;s sitting that way. My recommendation: start with a good, licensed massage therapist. It may be muscular, and if not, well, all I #8217;m saying is I have a regular chiropractor on my massage therapist #8217;s recommendation and it #8217;s helped me A LOT. If the massage therapist doesn #8217;t help, try a chiropractor. The problem may be relatively minor dislocations that add up to one big problem. When I went for my first adjustment, one of my legs was actually shorter than the other due to pressure on the spine. At my next medical doctor #8217;s appointment, I asked them to check my height. I #8217;d gained two inches. If you do this, make sure you look for what I call a  #8220;medical chiropractor #8221; (e.g.  #8220;dislocated neck bones may cause migraines and this will ease your symptoms by returning the spine to its correct position #8221;) as opposed to a  #8220;woo chiropractor #8221; ( #8220;chiropractic can help prevent cancer! Have you tried essential oils? #8221;). I actually go to The Joint and it #8217;s helped A LOT of my problems, no medication needed. If, however, THAT does not help, or the chiro is the type who does X-rays and they determine the problem is skeletal, you #8217;ll need to see your GP and get a referral to an orthopedist. The reason I recommend starting with the other options is that it #8217;s cheaper than putting out $100s or even $1000s only to find out your problem could have been solved with a good back-cracking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just wanted to say I like this concept of yours, that some of us have a Torah of mitzvot and some a Torah of tikkun olam. I don #8217;t deny that Orthodox Jews certainly read and adhere to Torah as they see correct, but so do I. The idea that it #8217;s because we see different main theses in Torah is really a beautiful way to illustrate that difference without needing to come down on either side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely get what you mean, but I may have unintentionally misrepresented what I #8217;m doing. While the character is  #8220;in a video game, #8221; it #8217;s functionally a game of their own making #8212;many pieces from many, many games. I specifically wanted the terminals because I want them to be like  #8220;literally no longer own the games because the sale of the company pissed me off so bad, so why is it suddenly on my computer? #8221; And that #8217;s where their problem starts. There #8217;s a long history of horror and creepypasta set in or around video games. Personal opinion, but anything that #8217;s set in a single game (say, if I #8217;d just chucked the character into Super Mario) has to compete with BEN DROWNED, and I #8217;m not up for that kind of competition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just now finishing up Fens Street Sewer, and I stopped to listen to all the Dear Detective tapes because last time I did it was more than a year ago. So here's a fun one for you guys I haven't seen anybody mention before:  #8203; On Dear Detective 4, the Phantom says "now you are here with me." This is a line from a very famous musical about a *different* Phantom, who also lives in a sewer.  #8203; Also, the song that line is from is called "Point of No Return." It's from an opera-within-the-musical, and the characters being played by Christine and the Phantom are . . . not to put too fine a point on it, they're about to fuck. Please consider the mysterious random couple on a mattress very shortly after Dear Detective 4.  #8203; Like . . . the name made it pretty obvious what the inspiration was (they didn't call him the Fens Street Mangler, after all), but I thought it was pretty cool there's an explicit reference to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical in there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question for Orthodox: My roommate found a thing, is it kosher?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-27 23:33:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>My roommates and I just moved into a new house (not that you could tell by all my  #8220;please help, how do I move the thing #8221; questions). It has an electric stove, but we get to upgrade the stove if we want to, so she #8217;s picking out a gas range. She found something that sounds really cool, but I #8217;m curious if it #8217;s kosher for Orthodox purposes. It #8217;s a gas stove with a  #8220;Sabbath mode. #8221; Automatically turns on the oven for continuous bake for a programmable amount of time, turns off a lot of other functions. And according to her, it #8217;s ACTUALLY CALLED Sabbath Mode #8212;this is what it #8217;s marketed for. (My roommates are gentiles, but they #8217;re super-bomb about inclusion and allyship #8212;if she says it #8217;s called Sabbath Mode, it #8217;s called Sabbath Mode.) Is this kind of function kosher for Orthodoxy? Or would it be considered planning in advance to break Sabbath for those who don #8217;t use electricity on Shabbat?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OKAY. Here you go. Please keep in mind that I run a mod list that's only partially sorted because I'm still learning how to do that, so I cannot guarantee these actually all play nicely together. I'm pretty sure they do, though.  #8203;  #8203; [Minutemen Overhaul 2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13115) This basically entirely redoes the faction. There are UNIFORMS now. And Vertibirds! Quite a lot of this is an all-in-one "I took the really good mods, got permission to put them all together from their creators, and then did that" mod. [Minutemen Morale Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16715) If you want to decorate your settlements or The Castle with some Minutemen-themed propaganda and recruiting posters, you want this. [One Minutemen Radiant Quest At A Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22296) Exactly what it says on the box. May or may not work; I haven't yet figured out which of my other mods it's conflicting with, but can verify it is *not* one of the mods on this list. (Or at least . . . . not *only* one that's on this list.) [Minutemen Radiant Squads](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44355) This is the one I mentioned above. I haven't yet figured out how to use all the features, but it's pretty great, and if you haven't taken the Castle yet, it'll actually send you additional Minutemen to do it with.  #8203; BONUS: [GruffyDD's Signs And Posters](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9711) This is. If you want to do a full Minutemen build, *you have to have this.* There are two different kinds of insignia placards, some propaganda and notification signs, a whole new Minutemen flag (which I must tell you makes *way more sense* if the Sole is the General), and a set of signs I cannot live without, which have the various settlement names on them and indicate they're "part of the Minutemen Commonwealth Network." If you're a BOS player he has a damned nice selection for BOS bunkers and such, as well. Institute and Railroad are a little scantier, but dude. Still worth it. SO WORTH IT.</TEXT>

It #8217;s also a gamble whether you can get enough NPCs to talk to you for the quest to be playable #8212;they may not activate. With that said, it IS an interesting concept specifically within the confines of Fallout. Basically a Nazi detachment and a Soviet detachment both got left on an island called Sakhalin and lost contact with their respective governments. Neither has any idea the war is over and they #8217;re literally still hanging out there fighting each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Christ. Did you at least find the second notebook? Are you talking to people who #8217;ve found copies of their items to see if this is a common experience? You can #8217;t possibly be the only one who #8217;s seen this....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[FO4] I know there's a way to make my own custom posters in game. Help?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 10:14:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>So basically, someone told me how to do this like six months ago and I went "cool! I'll never need that" and then promptly deleted it from my long-term memory, you know, like an idiot. Well, they get the last laugh, because here I sit going " . . . . I'm building a library, I need a poster of library rules. I'll just--fuck, how do I do that again?" So--somebody please remind me, as someone who has not yet started building mods because my computer is a tragedy, how I do this. My memory of it goes something like this: 1. design my custom image, which must be at a specific size/resolution I do not remember 2. download a "your custom image goes here" mod, which I may or may not be able to do through Vortex I don't remember 3. in some way, I am supposed to combine these two things 4. ?????? 5. I can now use my custom posters in my game. Ideally I'd like to be able to make posters for all my "people live here" buildings--a couple for the classroom, library rules, a couple for my synagogue (listen it'd be really cool to have a poster of the alef bet in a children's classroom), that kind of thing. BUT: the kicker. I would like to do this without overwriting any of the vanilla stuff. (Unless it's using the slots for those weird light-up poster things. I could give a shit about those. I have never, in the two and a half years I've owned this game, used those things even once.) Please send help! I know there's a way to do it, I just. Literally. Do not remember how.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd love to make textures for people to have these in their own settlements. I think it'd make a relatively simple first mod. The questions are just these:  #8203; 1: How do I? 2: Can it be done on a laptop I *thought* was 1TB storage/8GB RAM when I bought it? (3: Where do I get the $1200 to replace this thing?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So here #8217;s the thing. I don #8217;t think the kink itself is a problem in general #8212;lots of people have it, lots of people enjoy it. Not everyone is meant to be monogamous. The problem isn #8217;t even that your husband has this kink. No #8212;the problem is something I haven #8217;t seen mentioned even though I #8217;ve scrolled through three quarters of the responses already. THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE IS GASLIGHTING YOU. You are very clear the behavior from his friends and your employees is new behavior. He downplays your concerns ( #8220;it #8217;s just because you #8217;re hot! #8221;) and insists he has nothing to do with this even though the behavior dates from the point where he divulged this fantasy to you. He is trying to undermine the known series of events and make you doubt yourself. Call him out directly on his gaslighting. Use the actual word. Look up a more in-depth explanation of it before you do, because I Am Not A Professional and you will need a bedrock-solid basis to stand on. Don #8217;t let him twist you around. Demand counseling at once. The kink isn #8217;t the problem. His predatory response to your hard limits is. And I assure you I could find several polyamorous friends to agree with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man, if I was in your SO #8217;s situation the only thing I would #8217;ve asked is if you #8217;d rather I stay with you while you napped, or if I should piss off to another part of the house. What the fuck does he think he #8217;s doing? Dump his ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trawling? No. Checking comments down here so I wouldn #8217;t be repeating anything already said. It #8217;s been the case for fifty years that  #8220;retard #8221; is a cruel and disparaging word. If you don #8217;t know this, it #8217;s chosen ignorance. So how about YOU don #8217;t be an asshole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've just finished Hunter/Hunted. Aiming for the Railroad ending this time . . . . and cannot for the fucking life of me figure out how to trigger dialogue to give Tom the courser chip. I know that's what I need to do, I've completed the game before with the Minutemen . . . . but it's been awhile and I don't remember how. The wiki isn't helpful, either.  #8203; Am I bugged? Or is there something I'm not doing?</TEXT>
