    <TITLE>Necropolis queries</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-09-04 13:37:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm working towards a new necropolis team and have 3 units sitting at 4*. I wanted to get some opinions from here before proceeding. I'm currently sitting on: Shihwa with no skill ups, Stella with no skill ups and Tarq with all skills maxed. Which of the three would be most useful against the lich? As an additional question, is stella`s 3rd skill effected by the lich speed cap? Also has anyone tried out the samurai`s supreme skywolf skill against him to see if it goes through the shield?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So after asking on here last night I've built up my Shihwa a bit, and now with free rune removal I'm trying to get her runes properly. I've decided to go with violent revenge but I'm not sure about her 2/4/6. Should I go tank and straight hp? Or at or a hybrid? Just looking for some opinions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd like some opinions on which of my three Light mons too 6* for the rewards pack. I've got a 5* skill maxed Ahman. A 5* skill maxed Darion and 3* completely unskilled Elpuria. I'm hesitant on Ahman since I've got a skilled violent chasun 6* already. What would you suggest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im very excited to try this game out but i missed the KS. Is it worth paying the mark up on ebay or should i just wait till aug/sept and try and snag a 1.5 edition from the webstore? Edit: Thanks for all the input. I guess i will wait for a 1.5 copy. Are there any expansions i should purchase in preparation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So looking at some of the items that come with certain miniatures. I came across the blood plasma gun and katana that come with the sci-fi white speaker. Are these items as potentially over powered as they appear. If not why? Im new to KDM and do not have a copy yet but im grabbing expansions and extras as i find them. Curious if these are worth acquiring.</TEXT>
