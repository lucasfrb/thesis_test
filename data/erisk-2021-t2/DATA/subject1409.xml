    <TEXT>I #8217;m currently living in my partners parents house, all 3 are classed as vulnerable, my partner is a carer for her parents, her mum having severe dementia and her dad having arthritis, my partner is ill so can be incapacitated some days and I have to step in, before this I was working in a hotel during the day and a micro pub in the evenings, I ditched the hotel straight away as I didn #8217;t to want to bring something back to infect her or her parents as they wouldn #8217;t have a chance, and I #8217;m furloughed from the pub. The household has been locked down since the start of march and nobody has left ( I #8217;m having to pay people to look after my flat whilst still paying rent for it even though I #8217;m not in it which is just fucked up!).When the pub opens up again I will have to go back to work, I will have to open up and close and try to get the place running again, but my partner says if I do I won #8217;t be allowed back in the house as it #8217;s too much of a risk to her and her parents. I #8217;m stuck! I have no idea what to do with the flat or my job and if I will get another job or flat in the future, (I don #8217;t see the pub being a viable business in the future anyway). The most frustrating thing is I can see my flat and workplace from the window as I #8217;m typing this. I know there are people a lot worse off and i am grateful for what I #8217;ve got but what the hell do I do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m currently moving some of my city about and I have settled for medium safety but I have found some things annoying; Small stations allow dense high rise and spare blocks for parks and landscape to increase value but you end up with lots of these near to each other where you cram them in and streets full of flashing blue lights! Medium stations look more realistic but create a low rise skyline right in the middle where you might want higher buildings and don #8217;t cover quite as much area as you #8217;d like Large stations look daft, I #8217;ve got some suburban areas that I #8217;m trying to gentrify and landscape and a large station would be ideal but look completely out of place! I wish you could mod buildings, I used to do this on my pc for sc3, you could then have competitions for the best looking buildings!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of the high rises are empty as near the top they get too narrow to have appts or offices in them, the original plots were zoned too small to begin with but they wanted and had the money to build an impressive skyline, the burj Khalifa (the worlds tallest building) is something like 2 thirds empty. The whole place is like that, just a mirage with no real substance, but the Arabs that founded the emirates didn #8217;t really have anything before oil except pearl diving and camels so I think they are probably quite happy with their current deal, they can always go back to the desert if it goes wrong!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who lives in the northwest it sadly does not surprise me that the r value has crept up, the northwest is comprised of lots of densely populated towns which are close together and well connected too, people get about a lot up here and it #8217;s not somewhere that is centralised to the same extent as other parts of the U.K. ,the nearest thing the region has to a centre is probably Manchester or Liverpool which are both about an hours drive at the most from anywhere else. In short it #8217;s a good habitat for bugs and viruses but I imagine a bit of a nightmare for emergency planners to try to lockdown, and there is the famous northern independent attitude too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recently been reading about Aleksander Dugin, he is a political theorist and author and his books are used as manuals by the Kremlin and Putin, I think his latest is called the fourth estate or something, it has instructions on how to manipulate every country to Russia #8217;s advantage, specifically advising the weakening of the uk #8217;s ties to Europe and America and destabilising America from within. It states that methods such as rigging elections and cash bribes are not to be considered dirty. It #8217;s really interesting stuff and I don #8217;t know why its not more obvious that everything is playing out very well to Russia #8217;s gain, I #8217;m going to read into more but try not to get paranoid about it but I think more people should look into it as well!</TEXT>

No matter how loudly they might deny being anything to do with the  #8216;footy lads #8217; to an outsider they are one and the same, I will be having little to do with him in the future because I don #8217;t want to be tarred with that brush either, although he does an awful lot for the local community it #8217;s kind of tarnished now.

    <TEXT>Does anyone have tips for passing assignments? I have several ways of passing assignments quickly, one is if I need to raise money quickly, ie; 19000 simoleans, I demolish police or fire stations and get it quickly that way, if I need to produce say 58 microchips and need to sell them quick to make space to collect more I sell them at the lowest price so 5 simoleans, also I keep my omega research going so I can quickly make omega money for when that assignment comes up, I #8217;ve also found that making items in factories is almost always quicker than mining the market as the one thing you need will never turn up for sale!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve just fallen out with two people over this and probably won #8217;t talk to them again, and I used the word furious too, it #8217;s my reaction to me and the people I care about being threatened, not so much by the virus but by peoples attitudes to it, one person changed their Facebook status photo from a self portrait wearing a mask to not wearing one and said they wouldn #8217;t be told what to do, the other person said that people should be able to do what they want and masks don #8217;t work anyway otherwise we would have been wearing them from the start, I #8217;ve basically called them both stupid and shown no respect at all for their views on this, just shot them down, and I #8217;m stubborn so I #8217;m not going to say sorry. It seems this kind of polarisation is happening everywhere and if it becomes ingrained will become as dangerous as the pandemic itself is; it #8217;s an unknowable quantity, it #8217;s proven to be a threat, it #8217;s changed everything and there always has to be someone to be blamed and of course the closer the person to home the easier they are to blame, I know and understand all this but I just cant let myself accept someone #8217;s view if its based on lies and sheer ignorance such as  #8220;just say you #8217;ve got a medical reason not to wear one and you don #8217;t have to #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I spent ages one day as a kid in the back yard shooting my 22 air rifle straight up to see if I could hit myself with the falling pellet, as a kind of dare and I timed it as well. I concluded several things, one was that it takes a surprising amount of time for the pellet to go up and come back, around 3 seconds, also that they hurt a bit if they hit you in the eye and finally that if I #8217;d done this with an air rifle someone must have done it with a real gun!</TEXT>

It matters if you had been in one day but not the next or if it was day one but you #8217;d been in in day two, it shows that the contact list idea works but maybe it might still be too early, although I want to get back to work in my pub and off furlough!

Although the a.o.n.b is called the forest of Bowland the region itself has no specific boundaries, it is roughly the area from the Ribble valley in the south to the Lune valley in the north, with the M6 to the west and the north York #8217;s moors to the east.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The forest of bowland, although a very verdant part of the country and run through with many wooded valleys and cloughs, is not a forest in the traditional sense, this term originates with the creation of enclosed areas of land for hunting of game by nobility in the Norman period, there are several such forests in the U.K., such as the new forest, Sherwood Forest and Trawden forests, each with their own peculiarities. Bowland is thought to mean land of river valleys, in old English  #8216;boga #8217; and is nothing to do with bows as in archery. The valleys in this area have been farmed since before Viking settlers spread across the country and there is a very noticeable Norse influence on many of the place names and surnames here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When entering the forest of bowland a.o.n.b you may pass one of these signs, the graceful bird of prey depicted on the sign is the Goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, which has long been the emblem of the forest, the Latin name translating as  #8216;hawk of nobility #8217; as only nobles were permitted to fly this bird at game. Goshawks are very shy of humans but not shy at all about what they hunt, captive hawks are commonly flown at game birds such as pheasants and will take mallard in flight, in the wild they prefer densely wooded areas. I have seen for myself how persistent they are when hunting and have seen a wild female bird take down a cock pheasant after crashing through branches and then sprinting after it along the ground, it looked remarkably like one of the raptors from Jurassic park, they predate on other birds of prey too. One of their nicknames is the  #8220;queen of the forest #8221;, most of Britain #8217;s native birds of prey are to be found in the forest of bowland but this is one of the hardest to see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of the forest of Bowland is still essentially a royal hunting forest, the northwest of Bowland is owned by Grosvenor estates who own a large chunk of London as well, their holdings being the 18,000 acre Abbeystead estate, the queen spends a lot of the year at Abbeystead as it is more discreet than Balmoral or her other residences and entertains shooting parties here too, until recently it was entirely possible to see her majesty driving a landrover defender on the private gravel tracks above Abbeystead house, her own estate is the neighbouring Whitewell shoot which is just through the trough of bowland in the Hodder valley and is run by the duchy of Lancaster. Abbeystead itself was built for earl Sefton in Elizabethan times and is down a track just off from the village of Abbeystead itself next to a smallish lake which is often frequented by migrating ospreys on their way to and from loch garten in the Scottish highlands. Tenants on the estate are reputedly well looked after and the estate is immaculately kept, all the doors and windows on the estate have to be a uniform colour, external satellite dishes and aerials are banned and there is very poor phone reception as mobile phone masts are not permitted, a bit like downham estate, also in lancs, when I worked at Abbeystead there had been an incident with a guns Labrador which had cut itself on a barbed wire fence, we were ordered to remove all barbed wire so this wouldn #8217;t happen to another guest again. The estate is famous for being a residence for royalty but is infamous for two reasons which I #8217;ll cover in another post, one being the most grouse shot in a day ever and the other being a sadly fatal gas explosion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately the Hodder valley show won #8217;t be going ahead this sep, this show is one of the archetypal country shows, and is unique in being the only one which changes venue every year being held alternately in either newton, Dunsop or slaidburn, these being the three main villages in the Hodder valley, if you get there next year you have to spend some time in the beer tent and keep your ears open, you might not be able to understand the local dialect but it #8217;s very pleasant to listen to and the gossip you might overhear will definitely be worth listening in on!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The trough of Bowland is a pass through the gritstone hills which links the western and eastern parts of the hills, it is famous for its scenery and is often compared to a Swiss mountain pass or a Scottish glen although it #8217;s nowhere near that scale of majesty it certainly has a unique character and beauty which makes it very popular to drivers, motorcyclists and in particular cyclists, near the apex of the pass is an old stone road marker which counts out the miles to Lancaster, some historians think that it is by this route that the pendle witches were taken to trial at Lancaster although there are some doubts as the route might not have existed then and there is no record of which way they were taken, near here is the wreckage of a ww2 plane which crashed into a bog in cloudy weather, on the south facing flanks of the valley are some of the best bilberry bushes to be found in the area which brings locals here with Tupperware boxes to pick them in late summer, they #8217;re not THE best though as I #8217;m not sharing that!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Below the higher fells of Fairsnape and Parlick, and above the beautiful villages of Chipping and Inglewhite sits the small but perfectly formed Beacon fell, named for the beacons which have been lit upon its summit for centuries to warn of invading vikings, Scottish raiders and parliamentarians, or more recently to mark the millennium and jubilee. To several generations beacon fell has become important as a place where new memories are made and old ones are remembered, being only ten minutes away from the nearby town of Preston and very accessible, the views over the Fylde coast and further on a clear day are memorably stunning and make it an obvious destination for a drive or cycle out. http://www.visitpreston.com/visit/things-to-do-in-preston/outdoor-and-adventure/beacon-fell/ http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/country-parks-and-nature-reserves/beacon-fell-country-park/ https://www.forestofbowland.com/green-guide/bowland-visitor-centre-beacon-fell</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The river Hodder is a tributary to the Ribble and winds from its source on the fell tops near the Cross of Greet down to the Ribble near Mitton. Three villages sit beside the brackish, trout filled waters of the Hodder and they all have their own character, these are, going downstream, Slaidburn, Newton and Dunsop bridge, Stocks reservoir sits in the valley above the village of Slaidburn and beneath its waters sit the flooded ruins of Stocks village which has its own story to tell. I #8217;ll try and cover the history and life of each of these villages in future posts but this link will hopefully give you some idea of the pace of the Hodder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heather burning has long been a method of managing the heather moorlands of the uk, every year, outside of the breeding seasons of bird species and when the weather is suitable; dry with a predictable wind direction, teams of gamekeepers, farmers and whoever can be recruited from the local community head up to the grouse moors. A strip of heather to be burnt will have been selected long ago with the aim of maintaining a habitat fit for breeding red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus); accessible young heather shoots for the chicks to reach and dense old plants for the brood to reach quickly for safety when a marauding peregrine or harrier patrols overhead are two Important criteria for the upland keeper. Recently there have been some concerns amongst keepers and conservationists that burning can expose the fragile acid uplands to erosion from rainfall, with a resulting influx of silt and peat into already fragile streams and watercourses, also heather burning is also an obvious contributor to atmospheric co2 levels at a time when this is something of a concern. With this in mind alternatives to burning such as mowing, cutting and grazing are being considered and trialed, York university is one academic body which is looking into this. https://features.york.ac.uk/a-burning-issue/index.html</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found this account of the Wray flood in 1967, i had heard about flash flooding in the area in the late 60s from a gamekeeper called Mick Maudsley who had been on the fell tops at the time, he had a horrible experience from the sound of it as his Land Rover was damaged by huge hailstones which dented the bodywork and he got pummelled by them on the sprint back to it too, he had a hard time trying to get down off the fells too as the roads had been washed out, he had said that the sky turned completely black and he #8217;d never seen anything like it before or since. I believe the village of dunsop bridge was flooded in the same storm too and the river behind has certainly been scoured out by heavy waters at some point. I #8217;d never heard about the damage Wray suffered though so this is quite interesting, I #8217;ll post about the dunsop bridge floods in another post.</TEXT>

Just outside the village of Newton-in-bowland on a hillside to the left as you leave the village towards slaidburn can be seen an inspection cover to the pipeline, which continues across the hodder further down the valley, there are several pipe bridges across river hodder in this part of the valley.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The bridge at Newton was built in the late 18th century from sandstone Ashlar (finely dressed sandstone) and has triangular breakwaters, this view is upstream towards Dunnow lodge which has a very interesting history of its own, the land from which this photo was taken is part of the Knowlmere estate. This part of the hodder is particularly picturesque in autumn when the copper beeches along the banks reflect in the still trout pools, there is also an easily accessible little beach under the river which is good for skimming stones!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-04 13:19:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s been a couple of weeks since I set up this sub and it #8217;s really good to see some new members, I had a strong idea of what I wanted to aim for when creating it but it #8217;s been quite hard to decide what to put into it. Trying to represent somewhere as big and varied as the forest of bowland is actually quite hard, the latest ideas I #8217;ve had are to have posts about the natural history of the area, which I #8217;m going to do alphabetically and as a collection, I #8217;ve also got some photos and videos of my own which I #8217;m posting with some background to the subject. The poll I put out a week ago was interesting with 16 people saying they had heard about the area and 16 people saying they hadn #8217;t, I wonder if I should do another one in the future? If you have any ideas of what you would like to see from this sub in the future please let me know and feel free to post anything too, it #8217;d be great to see what ideas people have and what stories they have to tell about the area, also Thankyou to whoever gave me the award for the post about the plane landing at dunsop, I #8217;d actually forgotten all about that until I found the photos. I hope everybody has a good week and again thanks for joining, bye for now:)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/lesser-black-backed-gull/ The lesser Black backed gull Larus fuscus is a medium sized gull which nests on cliffs islands and moorland, there are two colonies of international importance in bowland which make it a special protection area (s.p.a), they like to breed in quiet places away from any disturbance so in bowland nest in the fell tops miles away from any roads, they live in dense colonies which causes problems with erosion and have, with some controversy, been culled for this reason, (see my post about helilift), they seem to migrate to and fro each day along the same routes and I #8217;ve always wondered if this is to council tips or fields for feeding?. On the moors they inhabit the same territories as Merlin, hen harrier, peregrine and other birds of prey. There is quite a bit of information about them at the bird hide at stocks reservoir. https://www.bto.org/our-science/publications/research-reports/assessing-habitats-use-lesser-black-backed-gulls-Larus</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sounds interesting, I think I #8217;ve seen black grouse on two occasions in bowland, once on the side of Longridge fell and once I swear I had two fly over me whilst I was near Langden brook, both in the period between 91 and 95, although I couldn #8217;t be certain I had seen them as they had been disturbed and were flying quickly away I have seen them in Scotland and they were very similar, I #8217;ve been told they used to be more common around the bowland area, the habitat is there for them and the people would certainly work very hard to get them to return so fingers crossed!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dolphinholme is a lovely, leafy little village by the river Wyre on the outskirts of the forest of bowland, it is also home to the ruins of the first gasworks in the world which were constructed in the 1800 #8217;s to power a yarn spinning mill here, also lighting the villages main road. https://www.lancasterguardian.co.uk/news/uk-news/remains-worlds-earliest-surviving-gasworks-near-lancaster-listed-scheduled-monument-2912758?amp, the remains of the mill were listed as a scheduled monument in March this year https:www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1466557 . Hopefully the ruins will be made suitable for the public to visit in the future as it is a beautiful village to visit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Fairy holes, prehistoric caves near Whitewell</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-07 12:21:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lancashire isn #8217;t exactly well known for caves, neighbouring Yorkshire having all the potholing fun, but the edge of the Limestone reefs that underlie the north York #8217;s moors do show their face again one last time in Lancashire before disappearing beneath the shale and gritstone of the area. These limestone protrusions or reef knolls can be seen at several places in a rough line between Pendle and bowland, noticeably at worston hill, clitheroe, where the castle sits upon a big lump of limestone reef and at whitewell where the Fairy holes can be found. https://thejournalofantiquities.com/2018/08/18/fairy-holes-cave-whitewell-forest-of-bowland-lancashire/ These caves are locally well known, I was shown them once by Neil, the keeper at Whitewell estate where they are to be found, and know a little about how they are meant to be inhabited by fairies or similar entities, hence their name, I have heard there are more, smaller caves in the area, but I don #8217;t know where exactly. These caves known as the fairy holes are little known outside of the area except to historians and cavers, even then they are rarely visited, to find them you have to ask for permission from the estate as they aren #8217;t clearly marked on maps. http://www.oucc.org.uk/procs/proc03/whitewel.html https://bowlandclimber.com/2017/08/12/fairy-holes-cave-whitewell/ Within the caves has been found prehistoric remains including shards of pottery, the area having been inhabited for many thousands of years, at slaidburn Neolithic (c.4500 yrs) remains have been found and stone axe heads have been found on the nearby felltops too, where prehistoric people likely lived above the tree line.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Cuckoo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-07 15:16:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>September is here and the cuckoos, which have been here with us since April have departed for home in Africa.https://ebird.org/species/comcuc?siteLanguage=en_GB The European Cuckoo Cuculus canorus, has, in the moors and fell sides of bowland, quite a reliable stronghold. Cuckoos are of course parasitic in nature, laying their eggs in the nests of birds such as Meadow pipits which sit on the eggs until they hatch and the young cuckoo usurps the rivals. So where you consistently find insect rich meadows, you may naturally find cuckoos. In the bowland area I #8217;ve mostly seen cuckoos around stocks reservoir where the watershed, owned by united utilities, is mostly wild meadows full of sedges and rushes, lightly grazed and interspersed with the occasional shrubs and trees, remnants of hedges, that the cuckoo calls from. When I said I have seen them there it usually been as they #8217;ve flitted away from one of these perched as they are by nature very shy and in flight can be mistaken for a bird of prey in their appearance and the way they flap their wings. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoRsIOSbpVg A cuckoo is much more likely to be heard than seen! In the bird hide at stocks there is a notice board dedicated to the cuckoos and recently the British Trust for Ornithology have carried out surveys into the migration of ringed birds to and fro this country and their winter home in Africa. https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/cuckoo-tracking-project Let #8217;s hope they over winter ok, hopefully we #8217;ll hear them again in spring!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This route has been relatively unknown until recently, the trough route being more popular, the ascent from the Slaidburn side is long but not too much hard word and very scenic, with very little traffic unless it #8217;s a Wednesday when the cattle markets on at Bentham so maybe avoid that day, the views over stocks reservoir towards pendle can be spectacular so it #8217;s well worth stopping to take a breather at the top. The descent towards Bentham in the Lune valley is very long and mostly straight but does undulate up and down a bit and is unfenced so be aware of sheep! The views open up towards Morecambe bay and the distant lakes and on a clear day can be quite breathtaking, on a winters day if there #8217;s snow on the tops and a low sun is lighting them orange it #8217;s absolutely stunning!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The remains of Clintsfield colliery sit in fields just outside Higher Bentham and are unique in the area for being amongst the last standing structures of this age of coal mining, having been abandoned since 1856. http://www.ukminingremains.co.uk/clintsfield-colliery/4545416108 This mine was opened in 1772 but was never profitable, so was just abandoned and never renovated for further uses. https://www.tathamhistory.org.uk/colliery-clintsfield.php The coal seam here ran along the north of the valley from Bentham to Wennington but wasn #8217;t profitable because it was heavily fractured and rarely wider than 2ft. https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/rural-sites/4399-clintsfield-colliery.html, Although nowadays this part of the countryside is quite green and pastoral, in the 18th and 19th century it looks to have been quite industrial so it is possibly a good thing for the landscape that there wasn #8217;t much coal beneath it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The working men #8217;s club in dunsop is locally well known, it is situated in a pretty but unassuming white cottage just next to bridge on the left as you come in to the village from the direction of whitewell. The club meets every Thursday and holds regular darts and dominoes nights, there isn #8217;t a bar as such, the only drinks available coming from can or bottle and the membership is very eclectic; millionaire landowners and ceos bumping shoulders with farmers and tenants from the estate. Once a year the pubs and clubs in the area hold a  #8216;shake night #8217; where finals are held for the darts, dominoes and snooker leagues, these can be interesting nights!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bashall Eaves</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-12 18:48:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bashall Eaves is a small village about 6 miles from Clitheroe on the road to Whitewell and a mile away from Browsholme estate. https://www.visitlancashire.com/explore/bashall-eaves-p88270 It #8217;s a very small village, composed of only a handful of pretty cottages, a post office which is only open from 12 til 2 on a Tuesday, a community hall and, just a short walk down the road, the excellent Red Pump Inn. http://www.theredpumpinn.co.uk/ The name Bashall is thought to originate from  #8216;beckshalgh #8217;, which translates as  #8216;hill by the brooks #8217;, eaves referring to the fact that the village is on the higher part of the township which also comprises the older hamlet of Bashall town, this is just a small farm now, home to  #8216;Bashall barn #8217; https://www.bashallbarn.co.uk/ which is a wedding venue now but until 2015 was the home of Bowland brewery, now based in Holmes mill in Clitheroe. Although the village is very chocolate box and instagram friendly there is a dark side to its history, one which locals still divert conversations away from, its name is synonymous with a still yet unsolved murder which occurred in 1934 and for which no culprit has ever been found. https://lancashirefolk.com/2015/11/04/the-passage-of-fact-into-folklore/ On a lighter note there is a bridge nearby which is supposed to have been built by fairies to help a woodcutter cross a river! https://www.stephendutch.com/photo_10954902.html</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Erica Tetralix, Cross-leaved heather</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 11:49:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Cross-leaved heather is a tall, tough heather, usually with pink bell shaped flowers and tiny, green/grey leaves although sometimes it has white flowers, the valley of Whitendale is named for the abundance of white heather on its slopes. https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/cross-leaved-heath It is a abundant and very important plant of the upland moors and can dominate the flora in parts, some of the Bowland fells, in particular Wardstone, have suffered badly from erosion in the past and have been seeded with Erica tetralix as it #8217;s tough woody stems and root system reinforce the fragile peat. It is also an important food plant, it #8217;s shoots being favoured by young grouse and its flowers sometimes being the sole source of pollen for hill living bees such as the bilberry bumblebee, red-tailed bumblebee and of course the honey bee, many times I have come down from the fells with boots and trousers dusted with pollen. https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/red-tailed-bumblebees/bilberry-bumblebee/ The distinctive purple hue of the summer fells is largely given by cross-leaved Heather and the hills would not look so beautiful without it carpeting the acid peat beneath, also many nesting birds such as pipits, parks and the golden plover https://www.bto.org/understanding-birds/species-focus/golden-plover find it #8217;s dense undergrowth to be the only source of shelter against sharp-eyed predators and the harsh weather.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Clitheroe castle</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-14 15:54:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Clitheroe castle is a Norman keep, built in the 12th century atop a limestone reef knoll in the middle of the Ribble valley. https://lancashirepast.com/2013/10/07/clitheroe-castle/ The imposing keep stands proud in the centre of the market town of Clitheroe and is surrounded by a well landscaped and maintained park, there is a small museum too which is well worth visiting. http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museums/clitheroe-castle-museum/ The castle was originally built to keep guard over the Salter way, an ancient north-south route in use in pre-Roman times to convey salt from Morecambe bay to markets in the south, as this was a very valuable commodity and risky to transport. The de-lacy family had, until the 1600 #8217;s, the  #8216;honour #8217; or jurisdiction of this part of the country and clitheroe was one of the family #8217;s seats of power, the family crest can still be seen above the doorways of several older buildings in the town. https://www.delacychronicles.com/ On the southern wall of the castle is a hole which local folklore states was caused by the devil tossing rocks from the nick of Pendle. https://elizabethashworth.com/2010/02/14/clitheroe-castle/ Another story has it that Cromwells cannon caused the hole. The views from the ramparts of the castle are breathtaking, from 360 degrees you can see all of the Ribble valley, Pendle, and the Bowland fells.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-15 12:35:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Waddington Old Hall stands behind ornate wrought iron gates in the famously pretty village of Waddington, the hall has a long history entwined with Lancashire and the ancient family names which shaped the county https://livesunique.tumblr.com/post/187370272582/waddington-old-hall-waddington-clitheroe The oldest parts of the hall date from the 11th century and from the 1300 #8217;s the hall was the seat of the Tempest family who inherited the lordship of Waddington through the marriage of Roger Tempest to Alice Waddington, heiress and daughter of Walter de Waddington. https://www.britannica.com/event/Wars-of-the-Roses In 1465 in the time of the wars of the roses, Richard Tempest, a Lancastrian supporter, was hosting King Henry the 6th after his defeat at the Battle of Hexham, Richards brother John Tempest was a Yorkist however and was informed of this treachery. With the aid of a band of men from the Talbot family in nearby Bashall, they raided the hall with the intention of arresting King Henry, Henry escaped though, through a mullioned window which still exists, across fields and down to the  #8216;hippings #8217; or stepping stones at Brungerley where he was caught crossing the river and taken to trial at The Tower of London. https://lancashirepast.com/2020/07/05/brungerley-bridge-clitheroe/ The hall was used as a farmhouse from the 1600 #8217;s and became increasingly delapidated until 1901 when it was renovated by John Waddington with proceeds from his investments in South African gold mines, he had an inscription put above the gates which reads;  #8220;I will raise up his ruins, I will build as in the days of old #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The [Fieldfare](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/birds/thrushes-chats-flycatchers-starling-dipper-and-wren/fieldfare) Turdus Pilaris, is a large migratory Thrush and the first flocks of the winter may be seen at this time of year as they fly from their summer breeding grounds in Russia and Scandinavia to overwinter in the British isles. https://www.birdid.no/bird/eBook.php?specieID=1238 They are a very gregarious bird, forming flocks of 2 to 3 dozen, sometimes even more, and constantly on the move as they forage in hedgerows and the edges of woodland for berries, their name reflects this as it comes from the Anglo-Saxon  #8216;feldware #8217; meaning  #8216;field traveller #8217;. Hedgerow plants such as guelder-rose, hawthorn, Rowan, holly, blackthorn and buckthorn are essential food sources for them as they will have burnt a lot of calories crossing the Baltic and North Sea, but they also forage for insects and will quite happily visit gardens for fallen apples. http://www.hedgelink.org.uk/index.php?page=21 Fieldfare constantly chatter and talk to each other as they move, making very harsh calls which are unmistakable and can be heard from quite a distance, they sometimes make a chuckling noise as well as they cross the fields. They are unique in their plumage as well, having a well feathered, plump build, a bit like a mistle thrush, with prominent dark speckles on the chest and flanks, their wings are red-brown, their head and rump a blueish-grey and their beak yellow. A flock of 20 Fieldfare were recently seen at Silverdale and the timing of their arrival in the U.K. has been used for centuries to predict how harsh or mild the forthcoming winter might be. https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/winter-thrushes-survey/resources/migration-images many bird observatories around the Uks coast keep annual records of Fieldfare migrations, the birds quite often travelling with blackbirds and redwings which have also been spotted here recently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/ Rewilding is a loose term used to describe the theory that natural habitats can be restored to a natural, pre-human state through various means. Methods of rewilding, some of which are currently being trialled in the u.k, include reintroducing species which are currently locally extinct but were once common, such as beavers, complete abandonment to natural process, managed conservation through changes of land use to methods deemed to have less impact on habitats, such as adopting organic farming methods, or grazing grassland instead of cutting. The topic, even the very word,  #8216;rewilding #8217; is very controversial at the moment, with conservationists divided down the middle and farmers, landowners, gamekeepers and almost everybody that has some sort of direct connection with the countryside having their own views on the matter. https://www.cnp.org.uk/blog/rewilding-national-parks-farmers-friend-or-enemy The U.K. is after all a densely populated country and food security is a serious issue, https://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/challenge/uk-threat/ with over 90% of productive agricultural land needed to feed the greater metropolitan area of London alone. This is an issue facing not only the Forest of Bowland a.o.n.b but also the rest of the u.k, tell us what you think about rewilding or fill in our poll.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dalehead Chapel</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-17 13:29:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Dalehead Chapel is a very picturesque and sylvanian appearing Church set in forestry on the road from Tosside to Keasden, it #8217;s present construction dates from the 1930 #8217;s when it was moved and rebuilt from its original location serving the village of Stocks-in-bowland which was flooded to make Stocks reservoir. http://www.dalehead.org/st__james'_church,_stocks_in_bowland.htm It was originally consecrated in 1852 by the bishop of the diocese of Bradford and still remains under their care, although it has its own group of voulunteers caring for its upkeep nowadays. The meadow immediately surrounding the church was originally set-aside land before the church was moved there and so was never improved with fertilisers or chemicals and since then has become a haven for wildflowers and orchids such as Ragged Robin and Early spotted orchid. The chapel itself is powered by a wind turbine which means it is self sufficient in electricity. http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/dalehead.htm Slaidburn silver band occasionally tour and perform at dalehead and it is well visited by the ancestors of families with connections to this area, it currently sits in the parish of Tosside and the Anglican Church there will often hold services here as well, the visitors book therefore gives a very unique insight into the genealogical history of the area and makes for very interesting reading, it is well worth leafing through and you #8217;ll be surprised how far some visitors have travelled! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nghhhp2AkV0</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kirk mill, Chipping</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-19 13:04:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the height of the industrial revolution the village of Chipping, originally an agricultural village, became a thriving centre of the cotton industry, in 1831 the population census was 1334, seven spinning mills provided the employment for this burgeoning population, all powered by the waters of chipping brook, the stream which winds its way though the village centre. http://kirkmill.org.uk/kirk-mill/ Kirk mill, just outside the village, was powered by a water wheel, 32ft in diameter but also by a small steam engine  #8220;for times of drought #8221; and was lit throughout by gas, gas lighting being a relatively new invention (see the post about the gas works at Dolphinholme for more information). The mill was regarded a model of efficiency and orderliness for the village which struggled to cope with the influx of workers, one street in the village was called  #8216;rat row #8217; due to its chaotic messy nature. After the slump in the cotton trade most of the mills in chipping became derelict but Kirk mill remained in industrial use, furniture firm HJ Berry took over the mill in 1880 and operations in the factory were powered by the water wheel until the 1940s, the factory closed in 2010 however. https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-1693051/Cheap-imports-doom-HJ-Berry.html Recently construction has begun on a 39 house residential area next to the multi-million pound spa, hotel and restaurant complex already built on the site, the size of the redevelopment plans caused a lot of controversy in the small village which is famous for its history, the village is one named in the domesday book, so many residents were worried this legacy would be damaged and the character of the village lost. http://www.chippinghistory.co.uk/ The village has, after all, won awards for best kept village in England and Britain in bloom so it can be seen how dedicated the residents are to keeping it as beautiful as it is.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-20 14:01:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s nearing the end of September and the start of mushroom season, wet weather is forecast and in this part of the country with the wet western prevailing winds we have some of the best fields and woods for funghi. Before you set out make sure you brush up on the basics and from different sources too, make sure you take guide books out with you too. I always take Collins  #8216;food for free #8217; and an identification book by the author Josephine Bacon, there are many good ones to choose from and many websites to look at too. https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/ https://www.mushroomdiary.co.uk/ https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/how-to-identify/guide-to-british-fungi-where-to-find-and-how-to-identify/ If you #8217;ve identified a good place to go don #8217;t rush out though, make sure you #8217;ve got permission, ask the landowner or farmer and check which fields and woods you can go in, if you ask where the best fields are they might just tell you, if they don #8217;t want them themselves that is! http://www.fungiforays.co.uk/fungi-information/mushrooms-and-the-law Also make sure you have something suitable to put them in, a basket or similar, I #8217;ve learnt the hard way that if you stuff them in your pockets or an old carrier bag out of the car boot they #8217;ll just end up squished. A few tips I have for mushroom picking are: 1. Pull them out by the stem, you get the whole mushroom and if you #8217;re unsure about what they are you can use the stem to I.d them later. 2. Check for worm holes, if you #8217;ve got a knife cut them in half to check in the middle. 3. If there #8217;s quite a big crop leave some, pick alternate ones so somebody, or something, else can have some for dinner. 4. If you #8217;re at all unsure about what it is, leave it be. Let #8217;s hope it #8217;s a good season for mushrooms, post pictures of what you find, you don #8217;t have to tell us where though!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Ancient Woods</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-21 14:31:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>The wild woods that once covered the British isles have long since been cleared but there are some places where a hint of the original, dark forests of folklore still exists. Bowland is one of these, having been cultivated and cleared since the glaciers retreated in the last ice age and having signs of settlement from the stone age to now, yet still having place names and history reflecting the original woods; Root farm and Staple Oak, both near Dunsop, Dolphinholme and Browseholme where wide open, safe grazing was kept for deer. https://nerc.ukri.org/planetearth/stories/608/ Bronze Age settlers would have been the first to clear the woods, archaeological finds from the era being found on ridges and hilltops where roundhouses would have had some protection and dry ground, the Harris museum in Preston has an axe head that was found near Tarnbrook on the very tops of the fells. https://www.theharris.org.uk/ Ancient, huge tree stumps have been dug out of fields near chipping and some of the deeper peat bogs. But no trees of that age and size exist now, in 1556 a survey of timber in the forest found little of any use, most being  #8216;sapling stubs #8217; or  #8216;old, hollow and heavily deer browsed #8217; the woodlands having been poorly kept and overgrazed for several centuries. https://aeon.co/essays/who-chopped-down-britains-ancient-forests In recent decades large areas of the fellsides were planted with commercial stands of Larch, Spruce, Corsican Pine and other fast growing species, Gisburn forest in particular and in the valleys behind Dunsop, where the unnatural, block like shapes intrude upon the otherwise sinuous contours of the hills, holding little of interest for any wildlife, being a monoculture with dark floors where little grows, maybe only of use for the gamekeeper as somewhere sheltered to build his pheasant release pens. https://www.lancashire.gov.uk/media/191686/Composite-1-5.pdf As these plantations are cleared native woodland species such as oak, alder and ash are being replanted now, so maybe one day some semblance of the original wild woods may return.</TEXT>

We could gone for something easier like the Heron or Harebell! https://www.birdspot.co.uk/bird-identification/hen-harrier The Hen Harrier, Circus cyaneus, is a medium sized bird of prey, found throughout Europe and resident in the U.K., it #8217;s habitat is open country, here in Bowland on the most open patches of moorland but elsewhere it can be found on farmland and estuaries, around the Forest of Bowland I #8217;ve personally seen it on the fields in front of Bashall barn, on the fells above Croasdale, Easington fell and Champion Moss near Tosside. https://www.birdguides.com/news/twenty-two-hen-harrier-chicks-fledge-at-bowland/ It #8217;s numbers have picked up recently in Bowland with 22 chicks fledging from 5 nests last year, the United Utilities estate being the stronghold for them here, these are numbers approaching what they used to be here around 30 years ago, before the moors were opened up so much to the public, a 1980 census recorded 39 breeding females and the numbers declined in the next two decades. Cooperation between equally dedicated and hard working parties has resulted in this success, with keepers in the area working with conservationists and campaigners to achieve the common goal of protecting the birds. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-year-for-hen-harrier-breeding The reasons for the inclining/declining trends in Hen Harrier populations in the U.K. over the years are, like anything else in nature, complex and interwoven, and are little understood. https://www.gwct.org.uk/blogs/news/2020/september/hen-harrier-increase-the-result-of-a-real-conservation-effort/ Hen Harriers are an apex predator and have exacting requirements for them to thrive, on the Bowland fells they have an ideal habitat but also unique pressures, some of them are summarised here with some personal observations too. Territory. The scale of territory a breeding pair need, in terms of square miles, is huge, and a pair will protect it vigorously too, against other birds of prey as well as other Harriers, a nesting pair of Peregrines will actively fight a pair of Harriers for room, there are anecdotal stories that Peregrines will predate upon harriers too, the female peregrine is a larger and more agile bird so it may be possible, I have personally seen a pair of harriers and a pair of peregrines spinning around in battle over a peregrines nesting spot. A Harrier will quarter its territory constantly for prey but will not tolerate any disturbance from large mammals, humans included, they will attempt to harass intruders and in the case of sheep or deer this will work, but human intruders are perhaps more ignorant, in the 1800s when the bird suffered a great deal of persecution from keepers it was quite common for a Harrier to accompany somebody to bring down any grouse, partridge or other birds that were flushed, this habit made them easy to be shot though so perhaps they learnt to avoid people. On the Bowland fells there may be a long distance between paths or roads, and few walkers or ramblers about, so they have less disturbance, also the farmers, keepers and other land users here know to leave them alone in the breeding season. A pair of harriers will build a basic nest out of heather twigs, in a patch of heather or ling, usually next to a stream on the south side of a fell or in a sheltered spot, so their territory requires this in it too. Hunting. A Harrier will usually hunt by gliding and skimming quite low over the contours of the moors, flushing and bringing down anything they see, they are fully capable of bringing down an adult Mallard, let alone a grouse, which are abundant on the keepered moors they prefer, but they may subsist off smaller birds such as larks and pipits, if a grouse moor develops a high density of breeding pairs of birds of prey due to the abundance of grouse, these numbers may have a detrimental effect on these smaller birds as well as they will hunt everything, if the grouse numbers are low one season though this means the birds of prey will not have any prey at all so will move in elsewhere, leaving the moor bereft of any bird life at all. In coastal areas the harriers have the freedom to move with the waders and other prey to better hunting grounds, they don #8217;t have this luxury on the moors though. There is some evidence that Hen Harriers in some parts of the country have been persecuted by landowners and their staff, but this is something that will be covered in other posts, in the Forest of Bowland however it is certainly regarded as a very important and symbolic creature, almost revered by some, used as a tool for political means by others, and so is sure to thrive with the care and attention it receives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>United Utilities manage a huge area of the Bowland fells, around 24,000 acres, most of which is water catchment for Stocks reservoir and water intakes at Brenand, Whitendale, Langden and Hareden. Woodland regeneration and peatland restoration schemes in these areas will have a huge impact on them and can be considered a form or  #8216;rewilding #8217; as they aim to recover some of the original ecology, whilst remaining viable economically too; grouse moors require heather moorland, sheep farmers require grazing, commercial forestry requires stands of usable timber, fishermen need clear streams and rivers and water firms need clean, silt free water, and this all needs carefully balancing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Moorland Association is comprised of landowners, upland keepers, shepherds and shoot managers, it was founded in 1986 after concerns about the state of Britain #8217;s Heather moorlands and the realisation that they are a very unique and fragile ecosystem that needs management. The Red Grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus, is a subspecies of the Willow Grouse and found only in the U.K. and Ireland, it relies solely upon heather moorlands for its existence, without which it would become extinct, management practices such as; burning heather, controlling predators, putting down grit, worming to control Trychistrongylus infestations, draining or flooding bogs to provide drinking water, and a 101 other jobs, are carried out with the aim of seeing the Red Grouse thrive, the grouse of course is not the only creature to benefit from this management, some species of birds of prey which rely heavily upon the grouse as a food source benefit from all this hard work too. In the Forest of Bowland generations of people have grown up working on the fells to look after the grouse in one way or another, for some the extra few quid earned on a days picking up, fixing grouse butts, beating or heather burning might be equal to the excitement of seeing the first pack of grouse break for the line, knowing that they #8217;ve helped to make this happen, one of my first ever pay cheques was for a couple of days fixing grouse butts, putting fresh clods of heather on the top of them, and digging out stones from a blocked drainage ditch, but I would have happily of done it for free just to be on the moors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Walloper well is found about halfway up Easington Fell on the road between Clitheroe and Newton, it is a well known local landmark having been there since before the Norman conquest, it #8217;s name  #8216;Walloper #8217; comes from the Norman term for the indigenous people of the British isles  #8216;Walha #8217;. Although a local, and very misogynistic, folk song equates the name with advice given by a pedlar to a henpecked husband:  #8220;I #8217;d tell thee what I #8217;d do if she were my wife, I #8217;d wallop her, wallop her well #8221;. https://www.thenorthernantiquarian.org/tag/newton/ The stone trough sometimes drys up now but until it was damaged in 1944 in military exercises on the fells it was known for being consistent throughout the year, it is still now used by cyclists to fill up their water bottles and it #8217;s clear, cold water is perfect for topping up a glass of whisky! I #8217;ve used it for both reasons myself many times and also to find bubbles from an inner tube when fixing a bicycle puncture! the water can sometimes have a slightly sulphurous smell and there are sulphur springs in the valley down below where there are also lead mines, the fells around this part of the valley are infamous for  #8216;willow the wisps #8217; or marsh gas as well. The car park just over the road from the well makes a perfect starting point for walks over Easington fell towards Grindleton fell, the west side of the road being open access land, the views from the top of this fell, which is a  #8216;Marilyn #8217; for those familiar with the term, are panoramic, looking over the Ribble valley, Hodder valley and in clear weather over to Ingleborough and Pen y Ghent, it #8217;s usually very empty as well as it #8217;s a relatively unknown bit of Bowland. https://lonewalker.net/walkinfo.php?walk=417</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s nearly the end of Bilberry or Whinberry season, traditionally beginning at the start of August the season doesn #8217;t last long although this year it #8217;s been a fairly productive one. People from different parts of the country have different names for Vaccinium myrtilus, in some parts of Ireland and Scotland it #8217;s called a blaeberry, in the South a whortleberry, with many other local names for this smaller cousin of the Blueberry. https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/trees-and-shrubs/bilberry This tough little mountain shrub is ubiquitous on the fells and moors of the U.K. and is hugely important for the upland ecosystem, it flowers throughout spring and summer, the small pink/white bell shaped flowers providing a welcome and long lasting source of pollen for bumblebees and other insects which might not find many other flowers to feed from on the high tops and lend their own pink hue to the unique purple colour Britain #8217;s moors are famous for. https://wildflowerfinder.org.uk/Flowers/B/Bilberry/Bilberry.htm It takes a long time to pick a useful amount of Whinberries, they are small and grow throughout the plant, some of the juiciest ones will be right in the middle where they haven #8217;t been picked off by Grouse or other wild birds, for which they are an essential source of carbohydrates, especially leading up to winter. Migrating Fieldfare, Golden Plover and other birds heading down to the British isles to overwinter will stop off to refuel on hills where there are good crops. http://www.fruitexpert.co.uk/why-do-we-not-hear-about-winberries.html Locally in Lancashire Bilberries are used to bake pies or made into Bilberry Charlottes, a type of tart, it takes a lot of work to pick enough though, filling up old ice creams to stick in the freezer is a local past time at this time of year and means a drive out to somewhere only you know about and getting a sore back, sunburn and purple fingers and clothes! But it means spending all day in beautiful scenery and fresh air, and is a highlight of the year for lots of people which they #8217;ll remember all their life and pass down to their kids, generations will go to the same spots, I #8217;m not telling you mine! https://www.thespruceeats.com/traditional-bilberry-pie-recipe-434909</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sika deer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-28 15:04:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>The end of September is the beginning of the rutting season for Sika deer, Cervus nippon, from now until November these large deer, similar in appearance to the Fallow deer but in fact foreign invaders, can be heard and seen about the woods and edges of forestry. https://www.mammal.org.uk/species-hub/full-species-hub/discover-mammals/species-sika-deer/ Usually a shy and secretive creature, Sika can be seen out and about more often at this time of the year as the males seek out and establish new territories, they will venture further from the safety of the trees into fields and their unique and unusual whistle, akin to a wolf whistle or a noise a pig might make, might alert you to their presence when otherwise their well camouflaged form and tendency to dissolve into the bracken and rushes means you could quite possibly walk past them all the time without noticing! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qaxLf6I78y0 Does will sometimes whistle as well and the males will bark like a dog, which is quite disconcerting sometimes if you are out at dusk and the noise echoes from the trees, they can be called quite easily by mimicking these sounds and as long as you are still and downwind, that means with the breeze blowing from the deer into your face, they will approach, very cautiously, to investigate. Sika like most deer are a bit colourblind, sensing movement more than shape so the colour of your clothes shouldn #8217;t be too much of a problem, but they have excellent hearing and sense of smell, so if you are aiming to photograph them turn the shutter sound off on your camera, don #8217;t wear any aftershave or perfume, and don #8217;t smoke! http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/content/articles/2009/02/18/your_stories_sika_deer_feature.shtml In the Bowland area I have seen them most often in the quieter bits of Gisburn forest away from the tracks and mountain bike trails, the noise of which has driven a lot of deer out of the forestry, which the forestry workers have been quite happy about as they will destroy any saplings, but deer stalkers less so as they have had to move their high chairs and deer blinds further out. I have also seen them in Grindleton forest and on the tops on Easington fell, they are also on Longridge fell where their tracks, two slots with pointed ends, can be seen in the mud on the footpaths, the tracks are very similar to Red or Fallow tracks though, both of which may also be found about this part of the country. https://www.sako6.com/about/sikadeer Interbreeding of Sika with Red deer is a huge problem where the range of the two species overlaps and Sika can be very damaging to tree plantations, so where saplings are planted deer fencing needs to be erected too, this is an expensive job and the fences can be intrusive as they need to be over 6ft tall to stop them jumping over, stalkers will be hired too to control them and the venison can be bought in many local markets and butchers, where united utilities have plantations of native trees growing as part of their sustainable water catchment project they have had huge losses due to Sika and other deer but the use of deerstalkers has proved problematic with some conservationists, giving project managers headaches! Another tip I #8217;ve just remembered for trying to photograph this elusive alien deer is to place apples in the same spot over a period of time, as they are quite fond of them,I have some photos somewhere, albeit not very focused, which I #8217;ll try and post later on today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just finished a post about Sika on r/ForestofBowland we #8217;ve got a huge problem with them interbreeding with Reds here in England and grazing all the native trees the local water firm are planting, they have deer stalkers to control them but it causes problems as the conservationists that want native trees planting don #8217;t want anything being shot so the other alternative is to put up deer fencing but then that #8217;s  #8216;intrusive #8217; so all the project managers are getting headaches trying to figure a way round it!

    <TEXT>Hello everybody thanks for joining! it #8217;s been over a month since I set up this sub and I #8217;ve put a lot of work into it so it #8217;s really good to see some new members, I #8217;ve recently been putting all of the natural history and history posts into collections, with the natural history posts the original idea was to do it alphabetically but I #8217;ve abandoned that and decided to post about what #8217;s about at the moment, so the latest was about Sika deer as it their rutting season. With the natural history posts I #8217;m trying to feature some of the less well known places, such as kemple end cross, although I #8217;m thinking about doing a series of posts about Browsholme as I know it quite well. I #8217;d like to start a collection about the pubs and inns around here but I might wait until everyone knows whether they #8217;re going to have to close again, hopefully not! Anyway thanks again to everybody, including special thanks to u/InjectingBleach for the drone pics, if anyone #8217;s got any ideas for what they #8217;d like to see or wants to know more about this part of the world just ask!

    <TITLE>Captain Richard Pooley and Wray endowed school</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 14:53:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Wray endowed school has a very unusual and interesting story, the original building dates from before 1684 and was built with  #163;20 bequeathed by a Captain Richard Pooley in his will, which read;  #8216;toward the building of a free school in my grounds at Weind Head in Wray, in hopes that the inhabitants in Wray will lead stone, sand, lime and slate and make convenient seats within said school. And I will give and bequeath the sum of  #163;200 of lawful money of England to be paid to the school master of the free school forever for his Teaching and Educating in Wray Free School #8217;. Captain Pooley was born in Wray and made his fortunes fighting with the Roundheads in the civil war, he rose up through the ranks very quickly under Cromwell but he came from humble beginnings. He was one of two brothers abandoned in Coventry by their father who was there to sell cattle from his farm in Wray, a lady in a passing carriage saw the two lost children and became their benefactress, raising Richard Pooley until he left to fight under Cromwell. It is thought that tutelage he received from his benefactor made him realise the importance of education as it aided him in his military career, which is why he decided to bequeath money for the building of the school in his home town. I can #8217;t find anything about the benefactress or his brother though. https://wrayendowed-school.co.uk/ An inscription on the lintel above the schools door reads  #8220;this is the gift of Captain Richard Pooley with  #163;200 forever #8221; and the date 1684, the year he died, the school has been rebuilt since however, in 1860 it was  #8216;enlargened #8217; on land given by Captain J.R Marshall, and was knocked down and rebuilt in 1885. The following article about the caretakers of the school over the years makes interesting reading. https://www.lancasterguardian.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/retro/wray-school-caretakers-had-hard-job-2546584?amp The surnames of pupils and staff at the school then mirrors the surnames you will find on the school register now, names like Wilson, Stephenson, Kenyon, Parker, Robinson, Walmsley and Roberts, the Robinson #8217;s for example are a long established farming family that farm land between Slaidburn and Wray, and have had generations of children enrolled at the school in Wray or St Brennands endowed school in Slaidburn. The school is currently run by the Pooley trust, a registered charity.</TEXT>

This most archetypal of native British trees is one of the most important culturally and ecologically as well, being home to more species of flora and fauna than any other tree found in the British isles. https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/english-oak/ Oak trees grow to immense ages, hundreds even thousands of years old, and are used by archaeologists and historians to identify the previous uses and boundaries of the land, in Bowland there are  #8216;landmark #8217; oaks, part of the landscape and known to generations, that signify old farm boundaries, mark the edges of medieval deer parks such as Chaigley or are  #8216;ghosts #8217; of long lost woods. Old roads and drovers lanes with ancient hedgerows will have oaks, quite often kept as markers for farmers to use when ploughing, Longridge road at Chipping has several with TPOs or Tree Preservation Orders as does Thorneyholme near Dunsop and several other locations, Indeed there are more ancient oaks in Britain than the rest of Europe combined. https://www.lep.co.uk/news/environment/search-lancashires-lost-landscapes-2933884 Recently there have been concerted efforts to restore some of the original woodland that would have been found here hundreds of years ago before the Norman conquest and ensuing land clearance for cattle farms. With many tens of thousands of oak saplings planted in cloughs and valleys up to the tree line where woodland habitats will complement the heather uplands. Native woodland boundaries being the most diverse of Britain #8217;s wildlife habitats. https://www.ehbp.com/the-definitive-list-of-british-oak-trees-their-history/ The old oak woodlands in the forest of bowland are important to many species which rely upon them here, in the Lune valley to the north of the forest of bowland Red Squirrels are slowly expanding lost territory and at this time of the year will be rustling about for acorns in the leaf litter of old oaks, on the 6th of August one was seen in Lowgill which is a hopeful sign of their recovery here. https://www.rsne.org.uk/ The Pied flycatcher, which nests in oak trees, has a stronghold in the valleys of bowland as well, there are many other species which will benefit from the planting, and preservation of English oak trees here in the historic heart of the United Kingdom. Who knows, maybe some of these saplings will grow into trees big enough to be used for replacing the beams and lintels of the historic halls and barns found here, such as the roof trusses of the Moot house in Slaidburn or the many gables of Knowlmere #8217;s calendar house. https://www.oak-research.co.uk/method</TEXT>

    <TEXT>http://www.lancashireway.com/stage-32/ Abbeystead reservoir was built in 1853 to supply mills further downstream in dry weather and is a local beauty spot, the graceful, horseshoe shaped weir also known as Abbeystead waterfalls is well worth visiting in the autumn when turning foliage and heavy rains on the fells above form a bow shaped curtain of water flowing smoothly over the edge, making for a very pleasant autumn stroll. https://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walk-photo-345901 The weir itself is a small and beautiful feat of Edwardian engineering, designed by engineer James Mansergh for the Lancaster corporation, as were the elegantly constructed wrought iron bridges at the top of the dam and the charming octagonal valve house which sits in the river valley like a small castle keep. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rEGbAQSPX64 Until recently the dam prevented fish from swimming any further up the river but a fish pass recently finished by the ribble trust has reopened the Upper Wyre and it #8217;s gravel spawning beds to migratory fish such as Trout and Salmon which will be running now with the first full moon of the month. One of the best routes to take to the weir is to park at Stoops bridge car park further up and walk down the side of Tarnbrook to where it meets the Wyre and then down to the reservoir that way. http://www.wyreriverstrust.org/the-river-wyre.html</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-03 14:13:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>The sloes, Prunus Spinosa, are ripening in the hedgerows now and after the first frost, which is the traditional time to pick them, I #8217;ll be off to my favourite  #8216;secret #8217; spots to pick them. Everyone who picks sloes fancies that their spot is the best one and no one else knows about it but this native hedgerow shrub, ancestor to the plum, is quite common and widespread in the U.K. https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/sloe-prunus-spinosa Its tough leaves, stiff stems, used to make walking sticks or shillelaghs in Ireland, and long sharp thorns make it an ideal plant for stock proofing, so it is found quite often in ancient hedgerows where it has been planted for this purpose or has spread because it is hardly preferred grazing for cattle, sheep or deer unless they are desperate. In Spring it #8217;s delicate white flowers perfume the hedgerows and and attract every kind of flying insect, audibly buzzing with thousands of bees on a still day, so are very important for pollinating insects, the small purple/blue berries which grow very densely and give the blackthorn hedges a blue tint at this time of year, are quite similar to damsons but are smaller and rounder, also I wouldn #8217;t recommend eating them raw as they are very, very tart! However this tartness doesn #8217;t deter migrating birds such as Fieldfare and Blackbirds from filling up on them, so they are also a very important food source for wild animals before winter. https://www.shootinguk.co.uk/recipes/sloe-gin-captain-harrimans-accelerated-sloe-gin-5092 When picking slows please remember to leave some for the birds! I also recommend asking permission if you are planning on going into fields to pick them, in Lancashire it is traditional when gathering them to take a thorn from the first branch and keep this for later, this is called the  #8216;father thorn #8217;, when you get home there is the long and arduous job of pricking each berry, if you are making gin, to allow the gin to soak into the fruit, a thorn from the bush itself is ideal for this and there is science behind this tradition too, bacteria from the thorn will aid in the breaking down of the fruit so making a richer flavoured gin. https://www.ginfoundry.com/insights/making-sloe-gin-part-1-hunting-for-sloes/ There are many recipes for slow gin, jams, chutneys and other things but as they are so tart a certain degree of sweetening is required, elderflower cordial or apple juice can be used in some recipes but as this isn #8217;t a cooking sub so I #8217;ll not list recipes here. Sloe gin made now should be just about ready for New Years and sloe jelly should be ready for Christmas, we always have both homemade every year but it can be bought as well, Byrnes wine store in clitheroe stock a very good range of sloe gins, if you make it yourself remember to eat the berries as they are edible and will have soaked up a lot of the gin. Sloes have been picked for thousands of years as archaeological digs have proved, layers of the stones having been dug up, and hopefully they will still be being picked thousands of years in the future so if you are ever planting a hedge or a wood please remember to include this spiny member of the rose family, maybe your grandchildren can make you some gin from them!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.inspirock.com/united-kingdom/tatham/great-stone-of-fourstones-a5275290621 The Greatstone of Fourstones, near Bentham, is a massive gritstone boulder by the side of the Slaidburn to Bentham road, on the border between Yorkshire and Lancashire, which it has long been a boundary marker for. There were once four stones all of the same size and stone but the other three are long gone, thought to have been broken up for making whetstones or for building barns or farmhouses. https://megalithix.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/great-stone-of-fourstones/ There are two theories explaining how these boulders came to be, both as captivating as each other, one is that the devil dropped the stones from his apron on his way to building the devils bridge at nearby Kirby Lonsdale. The other is that these are glacial deposits, left behind by the retreating ice sheets around 12,000 years ago, the ice sheets over this part of the British isles would have been up to a mile thick and left behind many geological features, such as the lateral moraines of pendle hill and Longridge fell or the drumlins found higher up the ribble valley. The stone lines up with several leylines and is thought to have have had significant importance to prehistoric peoples as there are the vestiges of carvings on the surface and  #8216;cup marks #8217; in the top, more recently these have been obscured with graffiti carved over the decades and the 14 steps that were carved up the eastern side sometime in the 16th century. https://www.tathamfells.me.uk/?page_id=286 The Greatstone of Fourstones has drawn visitors here for thousands of years as a meeting place for ancient tribes, an immovable landmark to demarcate boundaries or for more esoteric reasons, and is still part of the annual  #8216;beating of the bounds #8217; walk around the parish boundary but nowadays it is visited more for its views, which in clear weather stretch as far as the three peaks to the west and the mountains of Cumbria, the road to it is on of the best driving or cycling routes around this part of the world as well, just watch out for the sheep!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Red breasted Merganser</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 15:41:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Red breasted Merganser, Mergus serrator, can be seen on Stocks reservoir at the moment from the bird hides, and on streams and rivers in the area too, this unusual diver is a partial migrant in the British isles, heading inland from the coast when bad weather arrives to find more sheltered places to fish. https://ebird.org/species/rebmer?siteLanguage=en_GB The Merganser, like its cousin the goosander, is a type of  #8216;sawbill #8217; having serrated edges on the insides of its bill for gripping fish, being a piscivorous or fish eating diver, Stocks reservoir is therefore a favoured fishing spot, stocked as it is with trout to cater for the competition flyfishers which are out on the boats here at the moment. They will also eat anything else they can dive for and are a good marker of a rivers health. On streams where it is too shallow to dive I have seen flotillas of these striking looking birds drift downstream quartering the water and flying back upstream to start again once they have reached rapids or a bridge, sometimes they will sit on rocks to stretch their wings and sunbathe in a similar way to cormorants. When flying they will fly like cormorants do too, low and purposeful with strong, fast wingbeats. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jo83LevWeE In Bowland the Merganser breeds alongside some of the quieter streams in the holes of trees, they have been known to build their nests up to a hundred foot from the ground! breeding season is in spring and the young are usually fledged by June, when they will head with the adults to fish in coastal waters. https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/birds/waterfowl/red-breasted-merganser The Merganser is a very quick-sighted bird and will spot a threat from a long way off, so can be hard to photograph, they also constantly fish so are rarely still, on a lake or reservoir they will swim off further into the water to keep a safer eye on you but if disturbed on a stream will quickly take flight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s lots of adders around where I live but they don #8217;t like being disturbed so you don #8217;t find them where there #8217;s footpaths, you have to go off the path, Also they like boggy bits where there #8217;s insects and frogs to eat but also dry places to sunbath, I always see them early morning on these flat rocks that catch the sun first thing so they can recharge, they don #8217;t like sheep either as sheep will stand on them, so here you get them in the grouse moors in bowland but not on pendle hill where theres lot of tourists with dogs and sheep, they also start hibernating at this time of year so you might not see any again til March. Grass snakes I don #8217;t know too much about apart from they can swim and slow worms are rare in Lancashire I think.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-06 13:17:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>The [Rowan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j6602f/rowan_or_mountain_ash/) or Mountain Ash, Sorbus aucuparia, a common tree of the cloughs and hedgerows of Bowland, is fruiting at the moment, clumps of bright red berries attracting flocks of Fieldfare, Blackbirds, Long-Tailed tits and many other birds which welcome this autumn harvest. [Native](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/rowan/) to the British isles the Rowan is a very significant tree in many ways, it #8217;s carbohydrate crammed fruits, or  #8216;pomes #8217; are essential to wildlife in the months leading up to winter, especially as it is the highest growing tree in the U.K. and fruits for a long period, the berries still being in the branches long after the last blackberry or bilberry on the fells has been eaten. https://treegrowing.tcv.org.uk/identify/rowan The delicate white flowers of the rowan also grow thickly and become the centre of lots of attention from may through to June when the trees will literally hum with the activity of bees, hoverflies and other insects. The leaves of the Rowan or  #8216;roan #8217; are important too, all the holes and bite marks on them tell you a lot of insect larvae find them tasty! and if you were to stand under a rowan tree with a white table cloth and get someone to shake it you would find moth caterpillars, shield bugs and all sorts of insects, meaning that birds will forage in the trees all year round. In the steep, dark cloughs and rock strewn crags of the fells the Rowan is quite often the only tree tenacious enough to hold on, if it can grow out of the reach of deer, sheep, hare or other grazing animals that is. In these steadfasts it can grow to a surprisingly old age, over 200 years, and swept by the northwestern winds and rains can twist and contort into all sorts of wild shapes, perhaps this is why the tree features a lot in the folklore and mythology of Britain. https://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/history-of-street-trees-in-britain-ireland-part-1 In the north of England the rowan still has associations with witchcraft, the berries, leaves and wood being repellent to evil spirits and curses, branches of rowan with the bright red berries placed over the hearth in the winter to safeguard the home, the leaves of the rowan are also quite magical at this time of year, turning shades of russet and gold which flash in the low autumn sun and lighten up the winter gloom, providing a bit of seasonal illumination much like the ancient Romans or celts before them must have welcomed at this time of year.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sawley Abbey</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-07 14:00:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sawley Abbey, the ruins of a Cistercian abbey from the 11th century, sits just outside the village of Sawley in the Ribble valley. https://www.visitlancashire.com/things-to-do/sawley-abbey-p19603 It is one of the great abbeys of England that were dissolved by King Henry the 8th in the 15th century, the last abbot, William Trafford, was executed at Lancaster in 1537 along with the abbot of Whalley Abbey, John Paslew, for their part in organising the  #8216;pilgrimage of grace #8217; rebellion against Cromwell, who was the kings first minister. https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/sawley-abbey/ The ruins are not as impressive or large as Whalley Abbey, most of the stone having been removed over the centuries for building nearby farmhouses and drystone walls, but when the Abbey was whole, and a living, working community with Cistercian monks in the white robes their order wore working the land, it must have been an impressive sight, the scale of the Abbey can be seen in the video at the end of this post. The Cistercian #8217;s were a catholic order and believed strongly in manual labour and agricultural work, so much of the fertile farming land of the Ribble valley owes its existence to the hard work of the monks who first turned, ploughed and drained it, the order still exists and has several monasteries throughout Europe. https://www.ocso.org/ Nowadays the ruins of the Abbey are cared for by English Heritage and are open to the public, the village of Sawley itself is only a short walk away too and I #8217;d recommend visiting the area as a day trip as it is a very quiet and photogenic part of the ribble valley, Clitheroe is only a short drive down the road as well. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8UbwaOfKWnA</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s so obvious in some places, when you walk up Pendle hill you just see sheep and the tougher grasses and sedges that have managed to hold in, its a very bleak monoculture that doesn #8217;t really have much life or produces much in the way of food, thats why you need to have diversity, you used to be able to see skylarks up there but they are quite rare now, the sheep are also a kind of marketing tool like a symbol of the north of england, I think you can rear sheep organically and it #8217;s a lot better for the land, in the Lake District they are traditionally  #8216;hefted #8217; which means they come down the hills at night or in bad weather, so there #8217;s less grazing pressure but some moors just have too many, I think there #8217;s room for agriculture if it #8217;s not on an industrial scale, mind you a lot more people are going vegan or vegetarian like me so things will naturally change, deer and hare should be grazing the fells really. Also deer hate sheep so will leave areas where there #8217;s lots of them</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-08 13:49:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the nights draw in and the trees begin to lose their leaves some of the regions wildlife becomes more apparent, bats can be seen more readily against the dusk sky as they flit about hunting for moths and midges. On a country lane the small bats which you might see quartering up and down will quite often be pipistrelles, but over the rivers, streams and lakes of Bowland the bats that can be seen skimming low over the water, flashing their white under bellies as they turn, may be Daubenton #8217;s bats. https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/animals/mammals/daubentons-bat/ Named after a french naturalist, Louis Jean Marie Daubenton, this medium sized bat is found throughout the U.K. and wherever there are bodies of water with somewhere quiet and dark nearby to roost, they fish by catching insects with their feet and tails. http://www.bio.bris.ac.uk/research/bats/britishbats/batpages/daubentons.htm With shiny brown fur, a white front and pink face it #8217;s quite handsome as bats go but is very hard to get close to, being quite shy and particular in the places it lives, in the Bowland area I know several places where it can quite easily be spotted and where it roosts nearby, this time of year is mating season so they are more active now too, although they hibernate as it gets colder around the middle of December. Two places it can be seen quite easily are; At Whitewell downstream of the Inn, where the trees overflow the stiller pools of water, I #8217;ve seen them flying almost between the stepping stones here. At Browsholme where they can be seen on the trout lake, here they roost nearby under a bridge where they jam tightly in between the stones. I have seen them on the Hodder further up from Slaidburn and on the Croasdale too, there are cliffs here that they roost in. http://batconsultancy.co.uk/bats.htm After the bats have mated they will form maternity colonies which is why they are susceptible to disturbance, they will not risk rearing their young somewhere they think will be disturbed, caves and occasionally barns which are rarely touched by people are therefore very important to them. In Bowland these places are abundant and are the clean rivers abundant with Caddis and Mayfly, so this shy water-bat finds it a very agreeable part of the world to live. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B08bdn7pRBo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Blanket bogs are a rare and very fragile ecosystem, upon which many species rely, they also absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, so internationally are of huge importance. In the U.K. peat lands including blanket bogs cover around 12% of the land, much of this is in the northwest of England. [map of peat soils in northwest england](https://www.lancswt.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-04/Peat%20Soil%20Type%20Map.pdf) As much of the Forest of Bowland and Pendle is comprised of upland peat bogs I #8217;ll be trying to explain a bit more about the wildlife which lives in them and their past and future, also about the hard work that is being done to manage and preserve them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Roe Deer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-09 18:19:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Roe Deer is native to the British isles and very common, it #8217;s numbers are increasing too and it is now often seen in suburban gardens and parks as it has become so successful, in [appearance ](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/mammals/roe-deer) it is quite similar to the [sika](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j1dnhz/sika_deer/) [deer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j5t083/sika_deer_at_the_top_of_gisburn_forest/) which is a foreign invader to the area. At this time of year the coat of the roe deer will be changing colour, losing some of its russet tinge and becoming greyer to blend in with the winter woods, they are also seen abroad more often, Young roe will have finished suckling now and will be moving out to set up their own territories, the males may have a [false rut ](https://www.shootinguk.co.uk/shooting/deer-stalking/spot-signs-roe-rut-39985)at this time of year as well, a kind of a practice run and to establish themselves although they will form  #8216;bachelor #8217; groups, sticking together over winter. Roe will have to venture farther from home to forage too as summer foliage dies back and leaves fall from the trees, their [diet](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267786767_The_roe_deer_diet_Is_floodplain_forest_optimal_habitat)includes all herbivorous plants that they can reach! in the winter months when food is sparse they may even browse holly, and they have a particular penchant for roses, we used to regularly have one in our front garden which would browse the rose flowers and leaves from the climbing rose on the front of the house, oblivious to everyone peering out of the kitchen window at it. The [shooting season ](https://www.shootinguk.co.uk/shooting/deer-stalking/deer-seasons-83047) in England for roe lasts until the end of October and the methods used by stalkers or hunters in the woodland that they frequent is usually to position a [high chair ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U172czfYAdU), basically a chair on a ladder next to a tree, downwind of a glade, ride, or the edge of woods and wait for roe either to cross on their way to feed or to call them using special deer calls which mimic the barking sound of a buck. Roe are considered a pest in some situations here as in the rest of the country due to their grazing on crops and saplings, in this part of the world arable land is quite rare but there is a big problem with roe browsing in the extensive plantations of native trees that are currently being planted in some of the valleys. The issue of how to recreate the original forests of the U.K. without having to control populations of herbivores such as the roe is quite contentious, in other parts of the country some kind of semblance of balance can be restored by reintroducing predators such as wolves, but in the small, 300 odd square miles of bowland this would prove very hard, especially as much of the land is farmed for livestock, so for now control of roe deer through licensed shooting and deer fencing is the only way to prevent all of the hard work done planting trees from being undone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Appearing to be the entrances to abandoned mines or caves [limestone kilns ](https://images.app.goo.gl/BoBsTNmSLDBzsobRA) are peculiar vernacular constructions built out of stone that can be seen dotted all around the Ribble valley and the Forest of Bowland, like this one in [Downham](https://ancientmonuments.uk/119205-downham-lime-kiln-and-associated-lime-yard-50m-north-of-smithfield-farm-downham). They are usually built from blocks of limestone in a kind of a short tunnel or arch going into the side of a hill, and were used to bake limestone up to temperatures hot enough (900c) to break it down into quicklime, calcium carbonate, which is very valuable and used for a lot of purposes such as making mortar, whitewash and fertiliser. These small limekilns, which have been built and used since Roman times, fell out of use in the 19th century as bigger industrial operations proved more economic. There are several dotted around the Hodder valley such as this one at [Ashknott farm near Newton](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1016550) and one at [Radholme near Whitewell](https://heritagephotoarchive.co.uk/p336982164/h4FCFB71A) and there are usually earthworks nearby where the lime was dug from the earth. This article by [historic England ](https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/iha-preindustrial-lime-kilns/heag222-pre-industrial-lime-kilns/) explains more about the buildings use and importance in the industrial revolution. The Ribble valleys industrial heritage and evolution from a small market town to a hub of industry in the 1800s was very quick and centred around the existence of large amounts of very accessible and high quality Limestone to the north of Clitheroe. [Bellman park](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1021105) near Chatburn by the side of castle cements current works, is the ruins of a large scale limekiln used to make cement for building, a scheduled monument not unlike Clitheroe castle in size and construction and the precursor to the huge quarry and factory which is there now, there is a tramway to the works which can be seen crossing over the road near Chatburn but the ruins themselves are now hidden in thick woodland by the side of the Clitheroe to Settle railway.

    <TEXT>The [Kemple](https://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=26417) End Cross or Paulinus Cross on Longridge fell is the remaining, top section of a 7th century cross thought to mark the spot where St Paulinus preached the christian message when passing through on his mission to convert the north, this mission lasted from 619 to 633 AD, he is famous for playing a huge part in the conversion of the north of England to [christianity](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Paulinus), baptising King Edwin of Northumbria at York in 627AD. The cross can be reached from the Kemple end road about half way up on the right side, there is a standing stone with a hole in the top there which marks the path to the cross and is thought to have been placed there to guide pigrims. The cross itself sits on stone slabs and is very weathered and is one of nine crosses around [Stonyhurst](https://www.stonyhurst.ac.uk/) college. It is well worth visiting as the panoramic views over the ribble valley and towards Pendle make it one of the best viewpoints in the area.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Grayling</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-12 14:11:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Otherwise known as the lady of the stream, the [Grayling](https://www.wildtrout.org/content/grayling-trout), Thymalus thymalus, is a freshwater fish native to the British isles. In the Forest of Bowland the [rivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j8uty7/various_maps_of_the_forest_of_bowland_and_the/) Brock, Calder, Conder, Hindburn, Hodder, Loud, Roeburn, Wenning, [Wyre](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j3wp1u/abbeystead_weir/) and their tributaries, which all originate on the Bowland fells and which are famous for their clear, clean waters, are an ideal home for this beautiful fish. Held in high esteem by [game fishers](https://www.bgfa.org.uk/) for their gracefulness but also for being one of the most challenging fish to [catch](https://www.graylingsociety.net/angling), grayling are also indicative of the health of a river, feeding on freshwater invertebrates such as freshwater shrimps, mayfly nymphs and caddis larvae, also small fish when they #8217;re mature, their presence indicates that there are stable populations of their prey, which means their home is unpolluted and the water levels are constant. The river Hodder, the name of which is thought to mean  #8216;peaceful #8217; and which winds it #8217;s way from its source in the high fells, past the villages of Slaidburn, Newton, Dunsop and [Whitewell](https://www.whitewellfishingassociation.co.uk/)is one of the strongholds of the grayling. Kept in check by the dam at [Stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j6of5q/stocks_reservoir_fly_fishing_fishery/) reservoir the water levels of the Hodder don #8217;t fluctuate as wildly as other rivers in the area do, a certain level of water has to be maintained by law to prevent harming wildlife further down the river and violent spates caused by storms are prevented too, meaning shoals of grayling can be seen flashing silver in the light here when they are harder to spot elsewhere. Such abundance of this fish, identifiable by its prominent, spiny dorsal fin which can often appear red in mature males also indicates that the water is not too silted up, landowners such [United utilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/iya8a9/united_utilities_scamp_sustainable_catchment/) and [duchy estates](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/iqu199/latest_newsletter_for_duchy_tenants/) are very careful about preventing any work they do from causing large amounts of silt to get into water courses, mainly because of the hefty fines that would be incurred but also because of monitoring by bodies which represent game fishers and without whom there would less pressure to keep the rivers the grayling, salmon and trout live in clean. Permits and day tickets for some stretches of rivers in bowland can be bought from the [Ribble trust ](https://ribbletrust.org.uk/go-fishing/how-it-works/), [Wyresdale anglers ](https://www.wyresdale-anglers.co.uk/) and [Lancashire fly fishing association ](http://www.lffa.co.uk/river-hodder/) amongst other organisations.</TEXT>

At the moment we #8217;re still working on the sub, I #8217;ve just finished setting up some new rules and we #8217;re going to change some of the aesthetics as well so it #8217;s not quite complete yet but let us know what you want to see. As the Ribble valley is such a large area, (you could live by the ribblehead viaduct or in lytham and still be by the ribble) we are still looking for moderators and contributors as well so contact us if you #8217;re interested, again Thankyou for joining r/RibbleValley, come and get involved!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Shaggy Inkcap</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 17:03:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>[The Shaggy Inkcap](https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/coprinus-comatus.php) is very common in the autumn months in bowland and can be found growing on roadside verges, in meadows and on garden lawns, all similar habitats to the [puffball](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/iwidte/puffball_mushrooms/), it #8217;s scientific name is [Coprinus comatus ](https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/shaggy-inkcap/), coprinus meaning  #8216;of dung #8217; and comatus meaning  #8216;shaggy #8217; or  #8216;hairy #8217;, is fairly descriptive of its nature and it is also known as the  #8216;judges wig #8217;. It #8217;s most common name, the [Inkcap](https://www.reddit.com/r/mycology/comments/e98u5h/coprinus_comatus_shaggy_ink_cap/) comes from its historical use in making [ink](https://www.instructables.com/Make-Ink-From-Decaying-Mushrooms/) as although it is edible it has a very short shelf life and quickly breaks down into an ink like goo. There are several recipes for ink caps, they can be made into [soup](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/32724/shaggy-ink-cap-soup.aspx), cooked with [chicken](https://www.cooked.com/Antonio-Carluccio/Quadrille-Publishing/Complete-Mushroom-Book/Meat/Chicken-escalopes-with-shaggy-ink-caps-recipe) or just dusted with [parmesan](https://foragerchef.com/parmesan-crusted-shaggy-manes/) and fried in a pan for a couple of minutes (the last method is very quick and tasty but they have to be very fresh). The shaggy inkcap is fairly easy to [identify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGwbFv2WtHk) and cook, but in this video a similar mushroom the [common inkcap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8BkAMQxuT4) is seen, this is usually quite easy to separate from the shaggy inkcap due to its different shape but it #8217;s very important to be certain as the common inkcap can cause [poisoning ](https://www.mushroomdiary.co.uk/2009/09/common-inkcap-mushroom/) if eaten with alcohol. There is another similar, related mushroom called the [magpie](https://www.naturepl.com/stock-photo-nature-image01585060.html) but this is very rarely found in the bowland area, this mushroom is poisonous and must not be eaten, of course always be careful with any mushroom and if you unable to Identify it, leave it alone! I #8217;ve covered [mushroom picking ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/iwecup/mushroom_picking/) in another post and will cover other seasonal mushrooms in the natural history collection in the future, happy mushroom hunting!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-15 16:11:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Bleasdale ](https://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=119486312)circle is the prehistoric remains of a  #8216;henge #8217; or burial mound situated near the village of Bleasdale, rediscovered in 1898 and thought to date from 2000 to 1500 bc. There is nothing much to the site now apart from the earthworks and the stumps of 11 concrete posts which mark out where[ archaeologists ](https://thejournalofantiquities.com/2014/02/14/bleasdale-circle-bleasdale-lancashire/) think the original wooden posts would have been. It is still an interesting and beautiful place to visit though, set in between the larger hills of Parlick and Longridge fell and encircled by a ring of trees with expansive views over the valley of the river Brock and the surrounding countryside, the [site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzX_FR78Mzw) has a very special, somewhat insulated feel to it, like it is seperate from, yet still connected to the wider world. The position of the burial mound on the hill and the fact that it is aligned with the sunrise of the summer solstice is thought to mean that the circle has a very important role to play in prehistoric rituals. The two collared [burial urns](https://potted-history.co.uk/products/collared-urn) found there in 1898 and currently in the collection of the [Harris Museum ](https://www.theharris.org.uk/collection-item/bleasdale-urns/) in Preston and which are typical of other cinerary, cremation, urns found in the north of England, and possibly the oldest found, the accompanying incense cup and remains of cremated bones show that ritual cremations were probably the ceremonial purpose of the [Bronze Age](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1011678) wooden [henge](https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/iha-prehistoric-henges-circles/heag218-prehistoric-henges-circles/) although there are earthworks and vestiges of ancient settlements going back thousands of years, the name Bleasdale comes from the Norse for  #8216;blaze #8217; it  #8216;bare place #8217;, nearby at [Quernmore](https://lancashirepast.com/2016/10/23/quernmore-dark-age-burial-near-lancaster/) there is a dark age burial site and [claughton ](http://wyrearchaeology.blogspot.com/2006/11/grave-confusion.html) has been a source of Viking finds too. More information about the settlements long history can be found at Bleasdale[heritage centre](http://www.bleasdaleparish.co.uk/index.php/heritage-centre/bleasdale-heritage-centre).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Guelder rose</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 13:56:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Guelder rose, Vibernum opulus, is a hedgerow shrub native to the British isles, in autumn the foliage of the guelder rose, sometimes called the [dogberry](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/trees-and-shrubs/guelder-rose) turns stunning, vivid shades of russet and scarlet and it develops dense clusters of bright red berries which attract flocks of [Fieldfare](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/itbllg/the_fieldfare/) and [Redwing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j9633q/the_redwing/), this often means that hedgerows where the guelder are found are often the first port of call for hungry migrant birds. The guelder can be identified fairly easily by its leaves, which are vaguely similar to a maple or sycamores and are a hairless, shiny green through most of the year, with serrated edges and quite wide, also by its greyish coloured bark, it also spreads through the hedge a bit like a climbing plant. It #8217;s bark is used in traditional [medecine](https://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/g/gueros44.html) as an anti-spasmodic and sedative to treat cramps and so it is sometimes called [cramp bark](https://www.eatweeds.co.uk/guelder-rose-viburnum-opulus), it #8217;s berries are useful as well in [treatment](https://specialtyproduce.com/produce/Rose_Guelder_Berries_18457.php) of indigestion and contain many vitamins, they are quite often made into jellies or jams, a [Ukrainian recipe ](https://ukrainian-recipes.com/guelder-rose-jam.html) describes how to make jam, the plant being very common in Eastern Europe where it has a special place in [folklore](http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2001/220115.shtml), it #8217;s name there being the Kalyna. It #8217;s not recommended to eat the berries raw though, I #8217;ve tried!, they are very bitter and mildly toxic too, my reaction was similar to the one in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxnx0s9Nvq0) where a girl is picking some for her gran to use. It is an indicator of [ancient woodland ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/ix1ijx/the_ancient_woods/)and grows in damp, but not flooded, soils, having a preference for alkali ground but is also sometimes found on acid ground too, it is fairly [easy to plant](https://treegrowing.tcv.org.uk/grow/tree-recipes/guelderrose) and so is quite often planted in [gardens ](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/18919/Viburnum-opulus/Details) too. In native woodland regeneration schemes such as the [SCaMP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/iya8a9/united_utilities_scamp_sustainable_catchment/) woodland regeneration project that is currently being carried out in bowland, it is one of the preferred [plants suitable for habitat creation](https://www.lancashire.gov.uk/media/446096/Plant-species-appropriate-for-habitat-creation-in-Lancashire.pdf) as its berries are so important to overwintering and resident wildlife, although it struggles at higher altitudes where the [Rowan](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKecosystem/comments/j6cwc4/the_rowan_or_mountain_ash/) may be planted instead. In the spring it #8217;s [flowers](https://wildflowerfinder.org.uk/Flowers/G/GuelderRose/GuelderRose.htm), which look a bit like elder flowers, grow in thick white/cream clumps, attracting many different species of pollinating insects, in particular [hoverflies](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wezsmith/4444482267). They are strikingly pretty and one of the reasons the shrub has been [cultivated](https://www.plantopedia.com/viburnum-opulus/) into varieties for gardens such as the  #8216;snowball #8217; variety. This video shows how to [forage](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NnfZZawdprE) for and identify the guelder, in bowland it can be found on Holden lane near Bolton in Bowland, the Skaithe, which is the first hill on the road out of Slaidburn to Bentham, the hedges on the back road by the hamlet of Easington and by the side of Rabbit lane between Waddington and Bashall Eaves.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Crook of Lune</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 11:42:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>The [Crook o #8217; Lune](https://www.visitlancashire.com/things-to-do/crook-o-lune-and-picnic-sites-p11664) is a popular beauty spot on a sweeping bend of the river Lune, famous for panoramic [views](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDqQS3sr65E)up the wooded valley towards the distant moors. Locally very well known it has been a destination for days out for many generations, with a grassy green picnic site and benches, river banks for the children to play on and a cafe or butty shop,  #8216;woodies #8217; which is very popular with cyclists and until recently was run by councillor and local celebrity [Paul Woodruff](https://www.lancasterguardian.co.uk/news/fond-farewell-lancasters-councillor-woodie-852475) . There are several short [walks ](https://visitlancaster.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/files_mf/1522845103LCCWalk3PRINT.pdf)which start from here along the river and into the surrounding countryside including a short route that passes through a very picturesque wood which has recently been planted as a [memorial wood](https://www.lancaster.gov.uk/news/2020/jan/crook-o-lune-beauty-spot-gets-new-lease-of-life-as-a-memorial-forest) by the [life for a life ](https://www.lifeforalife.org.uk/forest-locations/crook-o) organisation. This was also a favourite spot of the artist Joseph Mallord William [Turner](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-the-crook-of-lune-d17199) who painted this scene in 1820 and again in [1821](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-crook-of-lune-looking-towards-hornby-castle-t04471) when he painted the view towards [Hornby castle](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/jaekyw/hornby_castle/). Crossing the river nearby is a [medieval bridge ](http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=889) which is part of the [Dales way](http://www.dalesway.org/route.html) and is thought to have been part of an ancient drovers route and also a disused [railway bridge ](http://happypontist.blogspot.com/2014/08/lancashire-bridges-2-crook-o-lune.html) which used to carry the Hellifield to Lancaster railway and over which now crosses the [way of the roses](http://wayoftheroses.info/route) cycle path from Morecambe to Bridlington. In 2001 the lune [millennium bridge ](https://www.lancasterdistrict.co.uk/lancashire-walks-lancaster-and-the-lune-estuary/lancaster-6-lancaster-21b-millennium-bridge-and-river-lune/) was built over the river as part of the millennium park which also has a 8 mile long [sculpture trail ](https://environmentalsculptures.wordpress.com/river-lune-millennium-park/). The shepherds crook shaped loop in the river after which it is named is also a popular spot for [wild swimming ](https://thryve.world/adventures/crook-o-lune) as the waters are unpolluted and clear, the night sky here is also unpolluted by light which makes it a good spot for [stargazing](https://gostargazing.co.uk/events/locations/crook-o-lune-pcinic-site/). The river is also popular amongst kayakers and canoeists, with the [rapids at Halton ](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/regions/north-west/north-west-facilities-and-waterways/halton-rapids) downstream being quite tricky and fun to [negotiate ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UZhfB0ImVWA).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Salmon Run</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 17:33:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the moment you might be lucky enough to see [Atlantic Salmon ](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/freshwater-fish/atlantic-salmon) run on the rivers and streams of Bowland as they make their [epic upstream journey](https://ribbletrust.org.uk/salmon-run/) towards their spawning grounds. Weirs such as at [abbeystead](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j3wp1u/abbeystead_weir/)and Waddow hall near Clitheroe and waterfalls such as Stainforth where they can be seen [leaping in the ribble ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dnSYbRVpYEI)are the best places to sit and wait to see them and as [salmon numbers ](https://sac.jncc.gov.uk/species/S1106/), which have been declining elsewhere in the U.K., have increased locally in recent years, thanks to the work done by organisations such as the [Ribble trust ](https://ribbletrust.org.uk/), they are becoming a more frequent sight. The streams and rivers in this part of the country are ideal for spawning salmon as they are largely untouched and relatively unpolluted, and still have rapids and riffles that prevent the accumulation of sediments in the areas of gravel where the salmon spawn which can smother the eggs otherwise. Here they can be seen [spawning at sawley](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5QE4hhOTsMw) where they have done for centuries, the monks at nearby [Sawley Abbey](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j6rc9r/sawley_abbey/) used to net the river here to catch fish. The salmon will head [upstream over every obstacle ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2JLbS64uRfs)to these favourite places to spawn every year, as the streams have both the shallower, more sheltered areas which fry will inhabit once hatched, whereas parr, which is the name for salmon which are in between the fry and adult stages, can find the pools and deeper parts which are a kind of nursery for them until they develop the physiological changes, called smolting, needed to move back down the rivers into the sea. Fishermen can find several good salmon fishing rivers in the area such as the [Lune](http://www.riverlunefishing.co.uk/), the [Wyre ](https://stmichaelsaa.co.uk/the-fishing/) and the Hodder and many [lodges](http://www.clerklaithe.co.uk/fishing.html) to stay at too. This site has the [fishing seasons](https://www.gov.uk/freshwater-rod-fishing-rules/when-and-where-you-can-fish) for england but different rivers have different byelaws, these are the [byelaws for Wyre](https://stmichaelsaa.co.uk/seasons-fishing/) and this is the official site for [byelaws for the north west ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regional-rod-fishing-byelaws-north-west-region).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Lower Buck, Waddington, haunted bowland</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:39:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>The [Lower Buck](https://thelowerbuck.com/) in [Waddington](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/it7vex/waddington_old_hall/) built in 1760 is said to be haunted by a past landlord, William Southworth. The [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ppBCOMkdaU) of William Southworth and his demise is quite curious, he became the landlord in 1820 but quickly gained a reputation for being quick tempered, picking arguments with all and sundry in the village. One night he was having a row with the local butcher but this time the argument became heated and matters descended into brawling, at some point in the fight the butcher stabbed the landlord, killing him outright. He was buried in Clitheroe at [St Mary Magdalenes parish church](https://stmarysclitheroe.co.uk/) where his [gravestone](http://graveyarddetective.blogspot.com/2014/04/stabbing-victim.html) has the inscription  #8216;William Southworth of Waddington, Innkeeper, who suddenly expired having been stabb'd by a Neighbour in a Moment of ungovernable Passion, leaving a Wife and Eight Children to lament his untimely Death, on the 16th Day of May1833 #8217; However he didn #8217;t let his death keep him from watching over his pub, for the next 40 years until her death at 78 his wife managed the inn, and her and the regulars became used to his benign presence, some of the older regulars would even place a drink on the end of the bar for him on New Year #8217;s Eve. Over the decades various staff and customers at the old country inn have seen or felt something or someone in the rooms with them, [ghost hunters](http://hauntedearthghostvideos.blogspot.com/2011/07/ghost-hunters-capture-ghost-image-on.html) have captured spectral images of a figure standing in a doorway, footsteps have been heard above in empty rooms and things have been glimpsed out of the corners of eyes... This has given the Lower Buck the reputation as one of the most [haunted inns in Lancashire ](https://www.spookyisles.com/haunted-lancashire-pubs/), over Halloween I #8217;ll post about some of the other haunted places around bowland, don #8217;t get too spooked out though, they are mostly friendly spirits, although some, like the water spirit peg o #8217; nell, which I #8217;ll post about next, are not.</TEXT>
