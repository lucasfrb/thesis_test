    <TEXT>Of course it is. The biggest one of all. But what is quite interesting is that even people who want to recover from self harm do on occasions look at sh related pictures/etc DESPITE the fact that they are fully aware it will or could result in being triggered and in the end: self harming. I wonder what are personal reasons for that. I can think of some ways that happens but wanted to perhaps hear from people themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I understand. There is so much talk about that show in the media for the last couple of days. I haven't watched any of it yet, but I probably will knowing myself. Curiosity takes the better of me usually. So without spoiling any details: what are Your thoughts on this show?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't know it is based on a novel. It sure speaks volumes, as You said, that even those whose experiences aren't much related to the show were shook by it. I can't say much more until I do indeed watch it. But thank you for sharing your thoughts on that with me. What made you personally wanna watch it? Was it because you were curious how it turned out in comparison to the book? What made you read the book in a first place? Are the issues raised related to your life or someone's you know? Or was it just curiosity? Or something totally different perhaps? Answer only if you want to, no pressure. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Adult self harmers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-19 15:04:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>There is this stigma and misconception about self harm that only teenagers/ young people engage in self injury behaviours. In my opinion it's very detrimental. It makes it so much harder for anyone older than that to seek help because it seems as if self harm is not something 'an adult would do'. Not only that: it's also detrimental to young people/teenagers who self harm because by attributing self injury behaviour mainly to young age we make it sound like something that people will grow out of. As much as in some cases it is indeed the case - not in all. And concentrating on the hope that somebody will simply without any treatment grow out of it by himself/herself is basically preventing help that could be provided if the problem was tackled straight away. By the time it is realized that a person isn't growing out of it despite the time passing by the problem can already grow into much bigger proportions and recovery will be more difficult, if still possible at all. Another thing worth mentioning is that if a problem is perceived as only 'young people problem' it implies that it has something to do with immaturity. And again: as much as it can be the case - it's not always the case. Assuming someone hurts themselves because of being immature is hurtful to self harmers of any age making people avoid seeking help and feeling even worse about themselves than they already are. Another thing that is hurtful when it comes to self harm and age is that there is not enough mental health resources directed at adults who self harm. In terms of statistics there is definitely more young people self harming than there is older people. But a big but is that adults who do indeed engage in self injury tend to do more damage and their sh behaviours are often more dangerous and because of all the age social stigma I mentioned above - they seek help less often. I am wondering what you Guys think about it...? Any thoughts? Are you an adult who self harms and feel this way? Would you like to share your feeling on the subject? Thank you all for reading my post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for sharing that with me. I also love reading. I tend to read fantasy books mostly, it's what I enjoy a lot, but I would also occasionally read something different either because I got a book as a gift, or perhaps it's a lot of fuss in the media about a certain title and I want to check it out. It's very interesting to see a book turned into film. More often than not - the experience is pleasant and interesting, I find. I am very sorry to hear about this dark time of your life when you considered suicide and felt so bad. You say: 'I was in a place...' . Does that mean this bad time has passed and you are feeling different now? I certainly do hope so... .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fuck... I am really sorry to hear that. Do you know why you feel this way? I mean... there are two categories of explanations here that I can think of: first - life circumstances (whatever they might be) ; second - mental illness/disorder/issues. I think every possible reason for a deterioration in mental health falls into one or both of these categories. But I might be wrong of course, it's just my thought on it. Would you agree...?

Bare in mind you should not feel pressured to answer if you do not wish to do so. Also... of course I wanna say that I am sad to hear you self harm. Yeah... it most definitely would be more frowned upon BUT only from people who don't have much knowledge or understanding of self injury or/and those whose lack empathy and compassion more or less. I mean... if someone sees/finds out about another persons self harm struggles shouldn't they express compassion and empathy EVEN IF they do not understand? I haven't suffered from cancer. Does it make me insensitive to suffering of those who did/do? Have you ever seeked help...?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh dear... yes, indeed... very often people who sh do feel very badly about themselves. Self hate and low self esteem are frequently mentioned reasons for people intentionally injuring themselves. The fact that your friend is trying to quit is a good step in itself in my opinion. To come to a conclusion that perhaps someone doesn't want to keep doing it is a very big step. It's very touching that you speak so lovingly about your friend. It's beautiful... to be honest. If I could just say one more thing: do NOT ever feel responsible for making her feel better about herself. Even if you had all the right words and all the right techniques and all help available and you dedicated your life to making her feel better... it may all still be not enough. It's very complex issue: there are those who can and will be helped, there are those who can but sadly wont be helped, and there are those, like with any illness/issue that cannot be helped. It's sad, but it's reality. The optimistic thing is till we die we never know which one of those we gonna be, so it's worth trying. Your role is not to fix help, but to be her friend. X</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing with self harm is, exactly as you said, You kept to very private when you were younger and also now... . The secretive nature of it makes it worse: more difficult to stop and also makes you so isolated cause you feel inadequate, like something is wrong with you. You said that your parents finding out would be the worst thing. You also mentioned cuting contact with mum for a year so... Would you mind sharing why u said them finding out would be the worst thing? I mean... is it because you feel it would hurt them or because perhaps they were abusive and showing them your weaknesses would be terrible? Or perhaps something else? When it comes to institutionalizing people against their will - it is not so common and not so easy to do. Does it happen? Hell yeah. Sadly... Im speaking from experience. But most people in psych wards statistically are so called informal which means they are there cause they want to. Sort of. They are well enough to agree to treatment is maybe more accurate. Im glad you found things that work for you. The distractions and therapist and all... It sounds like you are on the right tracks atm. Its brilliant! I dont mean that you dont struggle... Im sure it is so damn hard. A year 'clean' of sh? Well done! Knowing urself and ur triggers is important. Another thing I guess is actualy deciding you do not want to self harm. Thats a big one sometimes... How are you today? How was your day?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have seen it. It is indeed portraying certain aspects of the problem very well. Self harm in itself is not a mental illness. Having said that a lot of the time people who do self harm are suffering with some sort of mental illness or disorder. Although not every self harming person is mentally ill. A lot of sh-ers actually arent sick stricly speaking. People can have mental health issues but not be ill necessarily. Regardless of that self harm is a serious issue and whether the person has a break down, mental illness, mental disorder or behavioural issues every time it should be take seriously and all possible help should be offered. Thank you for sharing with us about the emerdale thing. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seeing therapist and really engaging in the process is one of the most helpful things there are out there for self harmers. Yes, sure, there is medication too but not all self harmers are mentally ill and so need medication. Also medication can help with impulse control but what with those for whom self harm is not an impulsive act? Well... it's so complicated and there is no one correct way to going about helping yourself with recovery from sh. Different things work for different people... but therapy is definitely very engaging and proactive way of trying to fight that shit so keep at it and best of luck. :) Remember that one slip up doesnt mean you failed at all. Recovery is a combination of big and small successes and big and small set backs. It is the nature of recovery itself. You do not need to feel ashamed. You do not need to feel like its all back to shit now, cause its not. Its one day. One single moment. Against all thousands of moments you did not choose sh. Tommorrow can be a good day. Maybe last night was needed to remind yourself what part of sh you do not miss... You self harmed last night - are you ok? Do you need treatment or help of any sort for the injury? If you do do not hesitate. If you dont its ok... its ok that last night was difficult. Mental health is not a choice.... we can do all we can to be better and sometimes it still all goes to shit. I have tried mindfulness on number of occasions cause its pretty popular at the moment in theraputic/hospital/etc environments. Most people like it. A lot were helped by it. Me personally... made me worse... Its not my thing. Well... I cant really find my thing. Anything that would help me. But thats another subject. Fight the urges Dear!!! Im keeping my fingers crossed for u tonight. :)</TEXT>

I have a personal experience with narcissist with abusive tendencies too. It's my father. He meets all the criteria of a psychopath... He simply is one... Btw: recently I have read some article based on a study about children brought up in a home with narcissistic parent/s... it was basically pointing out a correlation between narcissistic parent/s and child/children developing BPD - borderline personality disorder. It was an interesting read. I am sorry that your mother tends to make fun of you and your tics. It is disgraceful and unacceptable. I can only imagine how horrible it must be... I fully understand why you did not wanna say anything to her about your sh. People like that take your weaknesses and turn them into weapon against you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like you really are in pain... . How about have a little think about what is it exactly that self harm is giving you? I mean: every incident of self harm fulfils for a person some psychological need or needs. I'll give you some examples. Self harm can for example fulfil: need to express pain when words just dont seem enough ; need to draw attention to the person who might feel invisible, ignored, not cared for, not loved, lonely, or wants someone to offer help ; need to punish oneself due to underlying feelings of self blame, self hatres, guilt ; need to relief tension and accumulated pressure ; need to feel something when one feels numb ; need to distract oneself from something else ........ etc. etc. etc. So basically what Im asking is what psychological need does sh fulfiled for you the first two times you have done it...? It may be more than one. The needs may not be equally strong.. for example you may feel that mainly it was due to one need but in some smaller degree also due to another need. Once you identify the need/s that you are trying to fulfil you can start thinking of how else instead of sh you could possible fulfil this need. You can think about better and healthier options perhaps. Of course the main thing is you DO NOT attempt to kill yourself. But if that is your main issue right now, suicidal thoughts/plans then pleaseeee seek help. There IS help out there. There are free helplines of all sorts, there are therapists, hospitals, support houses, medication, self soothing tactics, you can reach out to someone you trust... I know it all feels scary at first. But it is worth it if you can only make it through the bad times until these are over... Often it really is about postponing the worst scenarios and just making it through... and once on the other end everything fills so worth it I guess and you probably wont understand any more why you thought of such drastic measures. I hope that helps at least tiny bit... .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello. Thanks for replying to my post. I fully get the way you feel. I'm gonna be 27 this year and I also still self harm although over the years it has gotten so so much worse (I 'started' when I was 12). I put the word 'started' like that cause I feel in a way like self harm is NOT something I have chosen to do. I feel like I was in a way forced into it or rather didnt and dont have other options (and shouldnt have) so the word I 'started' implies in a way some sort of choice and decision and I dont really feel like I have made that decision. More like it was the only option. IS the only option. But anyway... sorry for side tracking with my reply especially that now Im reading what i have just written and it seems really confusing... sorry for the confusion. What I wanna say: self harmers in general feel often that they dont belong... that there is something wrong... Generally it is due to stigma surrounding sh in many ways. It is misunderstood at best, stigmatized at worst. It causes social exclusion because of people being ostracized by family, friends, school, work place... etc. So self harmers in general feel things you described BUT adult self harmers experience these things even more due to what I said before about sh being portrayed as 'a teenage immature kind of thing'. The thing is... self harm as a part of someones mental health issues should not be looked at in terms of right or wrong. Would we say a cancer sufferer does something wrong for loosing his hair or being weak or whatever other symptoms there might be? Self harm in most cases is a symptom. Symptom of bad mental health, of mental break down, of mental disorder or even mental illness. How can we look at a symptom of illness as doing something wrong? The only thing correct about that word choice is that YES INDEED THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG BUT THE THING THAT IS WRONG IS A DISTURBANCE IN MENTAL HEALTH THAT IS ACTUALLY CAUSING A PERSON TO HARM THEMSELF. The wrong thing does not relate to wrong choices or actions themselves but there is something not healthy in the person. Something ill or disordered. Same way as physical illness. Coming back to a cancer example: the cancer sufferer is not wrong, his choices and actions are not wrong, what is indeed wrong is the cancer itself. The deterioration in health. Same way self harm itself is like cancer. So... following that trail of thought: I would love for you one day to feel as there is nothing wrong with you in terms of your being... you just suffer from this thing that is wrong. But its not up to you so blame is not on u so... u shouldnt feel ashamed. You belong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It all DOES make a lot of sense... I wrote back to someone talking about psychological needs that self harm fulfils for people. I will copy it and paste it here if you dont mind cause what you mentioned with sometimes self harming to be numb and sometimes to feel is exactly related to what i have written there so i will just post it here for u if it will be of any worth to u that will be great. Coming back to the way you feel... I am not a psychiatrist nor a therapist. But I know and met maaany people, sick people, people with disorders or mental illnesses, well - I am one myself... so I guess I can spot some signs and, truth to be told, its not a rocket science to know warning signs of depression. Thats exactly what I feel like you are describing. I dont know enough to judge what type of depression, or whether its a deptessive episode instead of depression, or wheather its a bipolar depression following a mania/hypomania... or whatever else falls within spectrum of that. I cant tell you what exactly it is, what I can say is that to feel this way YOY DO NOT NEED A REASON. There may be everything peachy in your life, you may have no problems big or small, you may have everything you have ever dreamt off... AND STILL FEEL DEPRESSED. Causes of depression are not always as clear as something wrong in life. The cause might still be there but more difficult to pin point. But it gets even weirder cause there may NOT be a cause at all in terms of your life. The depression can be so called clinical and it basically means its a physical structural problem like for example chemical imbalance or brain structure issue. So... you can feel depressed for no reason in your life except physical cause for it. It can be cured/helped!!!!!!! So you should definitely try to look for help. :) Especially that because if there isnt a 'reason' for it you may feel like you are ungrateful, silly etc that u feel depressed without apparent reason like problems etc. But there IS a reason for sure, but not necessary a one that is life circumstances. So do not feel bad for... feeling bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It may seem like sh is 'giving u nothing' but believe me - it always does. We never do nothing for no reason. From what you are saying the first thing that it gives you is an alternative to suicide (or something along those lines from what u have said before). But you need to look deeper. Much deeper. Your secondary need that it fulfils is avoiding suicide. But the primary need why you need to do any of those at all is still for u to discover. Why you may feel you need/would want to commit suicide is obvious - some shit in ur life (pardon the language, u know what i mean). You would like to stop suffering. But self harm is not an alternative to that because it doesnt stop the suffering u have. So look what it does. Maybe it distracts you fron the psychological pain so in some small way is indeed stoping some bit from the suffering caused by life circumstances. But it could be something else. Believe when i say - there is something it gives u.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for reply! To be quite honest I didn't experience personally all the things I mentioned in my post. I never said I did. I experienced/felt some of them, not all. But knowing also the struggles of some of the people I know about the issue with adult self harmers I wrote about different aspects of it. I fully agree about sh being much easier to hide when being adult. Much easier to hide and also to even do cause you have access to your own money which you can spend on whatever you want (for example things to hurt yourself with: meds, baldes, alkohol, other sharp objects and many more). So sure, I fully agree with what you have said. Yes... generally mentally ill are also badly stigmatized. I think even more than self harmers on most occasions but thats my subjective experience cause of course its not possible to actually measure the intensity of stigma or how badly it affects both groups of people. Another thing is that these groups often are part of each other cause in many cases sh goes hand in hand with mental illness.</TEXT>

Although that's something else I think from looking specifically for triggers because as you said you stopped reading the book today and chose to stop due to triggers. Having said that looking for that content cause its related to someones life and also because of wanting to trigger yourself can happen simultaneously too.

But it's a bit more: either do damage that will almost kill you or... wel... as close to that as you can get, or feel like you are worthless piece of shit, even bigger piece of shit than normally, like you dont deserve the air to breath... You know... sometimes when I cut and I do a particularly bad shit I say thank you to my razor and hand. Its not planned or thought through or anything... it just kinds of comes out like half gasp of pain and happiness at the same time and it just comes out of my mouth and then I think to myself what the fuck. About the 230 stitches. It was not a single cut. It was one 'cutting session'. So a single self harm attempt but of course not a one cut. I was many. On my legs. Very deep. Few of them bone deep. Some not so much but still requiring stitches. I didnt see the stitches being put in. I was lying on the bed. Stitching took over 3 hours. I didnt look at the surgeant and nurses. I just lyed there. And then they wrapped it up, u know, dressed the legs. And I didnt see until the next day during dreasing change what a butchery i did and how many stitches there were. I counted them shortly before them being removed and it was actualy hard to even count cause they were all over the place and my cuts are not neat and straight etc so it was aproximately 230 - plus or minus maybe 4-5 due to problem in counting them. This was the worst cuttin session I have ever had. I absolutely didnt take ur question the wrong way. It must have sounded so crazy if i implied somehow that it was one cut. About the blood: funny thing. One surgeant once told me after blood results that due to many years of sh my blood has now naturally much higher percentage of blood cells responsible fpr blood clotting. He said it is my body protecting itself from bleeding out... not sure if its true becauae i have never heard of such thing before or after that deapite even looking fpr the information on the internet. So dont know. How are you in general? How serious is yout problem with sh? Are you coping or not really?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey... This appointment you described... it was a joke. Not a funny one at that cause affecting your life. I am so sorry that you did not receive the help you needed. Clearly needed. You see... the sad and totally fucked up thing is that to find a good therapist is... very hard. Once you do find a good one... he/she may just simply not click with you and vice versa. So in the end if you look at it you realize that to get help through therapy is not so easy as it sounds. But it shouldnt be that way. You should be able to access reasources that can help you survive or/and the ones to make your life a good one. You should... but it's not the case. I know. It doesnt matter what country you are in - mental health care lacks everywhere. Psychiatry and psychology were always the underdogs of sciences. And they still are perceived that way. We came a long way... but there is still so much to change. Dont give up. One day you will find an awesome therapist who will help you discover a lot about yourself and simply... help you. It doesnt even have to be too distant future. It a lot depends on... luck. Try to get re reffered to someone else. This person, seems to me, treated you like a textbook. He read some stuff and earned some stuff at some point in his life and he doesnt have the drive to actually want to find out ABOUT YOU. He wanted to give you explanation but not the actual explanation that he investigated and concluded based on your words and body language and all the other things they should look out for. He wanted to give you an explanation. One that he learned once upon a time could be possible. He thought you are going to take for granted what he said. Take it as a fact. And that... seems to me is abusing his authority. You have EVERY RIGHT to trust a professional to make a correct judgement in process of helping you. You have EVERY RIGHT TO TAKE HIS 'DIAGNOSIS' OF SITUATION AS FACT. And he knows that. He knows he has the authority and he knows he may not be giving you the correct answer but he seemed happy to give you just any answer and that, in my opinion, is abusing his authority. Especially if we look at the initial assessment of your problem as a crucial part of directing the right specified help for you to actually make a difference. I believe due to his negligence he is jeopardizing your chance of getting better. I am so sorry for that. It is... terrible. Would you mind updating me on whether he got the letter yet and what happened with the situation since then...?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this is very very brave of you. Being open about is already hard enough at any age but while you are an adult it's even bigger of a deal. It would be amazing if all self harmers, adult and not, opened up about it. It would definitely help the stigma minimize and understanding grow but... it is not possible. It's impossible cause this kind of decision is not for other people to make, but for each and every one of us. Me being one of those people who do NOT openly talk about my self harm or related to it and also stigmatized mental illness. My close family knows. And my close friends know. And even that is not through me own choosing - my sh and mental illness got to the point of frequent hospitalization both in general hospital for physical stuff and psychiatric hospitals so clearly that's not something you can hide. I am do not post about it on social media which are not anonymous, even if I see a post I find interesting relating to sh or mental illness I am very careful in reposting/sharing cause I dont want anyone to catch on that I'm mentally ill and also struggle with sh. So I do know how it is when you just dont want the world to know... Yes, I fully agree with you that opening up about it is incredibly important: both for the person it regards but also for other people struggling with similar issues and also for society itself... but everyone has to come to this decision to open up by themselves and feel comfortable in that decision. It is indeed not easy thing to do. Well done for being open about it, it's awesome!!!  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello. Thank You for replying to my post. I'm glad you have enjoyed it. I couldn't agree more on the perhaps not fully accurate data regarding self harm. Your point is spot on, I believe. From my subjective experience I still believe there really is more young self harmers overall BUT I also believe in what you said that the full picture might look very different and definitely would if the statistics were able to include ALL... not just those who 'appeared on the radar' cause there is so many who never 'appear on that radar'. I believe that then statistical gap between young and older sf harmers would surely be smaller. Also... when I say 'adult' self harmers I dont mean anyone just after their 18th birthday. I used the term quite loosely because I wanted to talk about stigma around people who by society's standards are apparently 'too old to sh'. So perhaps mid twenties onwards. (Not possible not pin point exact age... hope everyone knows what I meant..). I also fully agree on your point about how being an adult self harmer (due to having circumstances enabling easier sh) puts a person into a vicious cycle of not accessing the support/help resources no matter if it's attending to physical damage done or/and psychological side of the problem. That makes being an adult self harmer very dangerous... and also makes lives of those suffering not achieve the full potential. I can relate to your fear of being institutionalized. Im so sorry you had to go through it... I can relate to it on a very personal level. I also have that fear. I also was on countless occasions forced to spend months in psych wards with no structured therapy to help, forcefully medicated etc. Nothing there helped me in any way in terms of sh. Quite the opposite actually: I got new ideas of how to hurt myself. The help for sh is very displaced and a lot depends on pure luck. There are very few facilities that concentrate on sh. Out of these even fewer that dont use punishable attitude to sh as means of changing behaviour. The issue is still very misunderstood even amongst medical or psychiatric staff. How are you feeling now...? xxx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of people, including myself do tend to do that... But reasons are various. I think its worth thinking why you do it, why you dont mind or even want to trigger yourself. What self harm gives you that you are willing to trigger yourself to get from it? What psychological need self harm fulfils for you...? Its something worth discovering but it requires a big deal of honesty to yourself... cause your reasons for self harm may not be what you would other want to think or what you yourself would want. The reasons can be something you dont even want to admit to yourself... but once you admit it truthfully to yourself why you sh, what psychological need sh really fulfils for you.. then you can think of other ways this need or needs can be met and fulfiled and then you can try those other things and stop on purpose triggering yourself and look up the content that drives you closer to sh. It all starts with gained self awareness... Good luck on this journey. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello. The amount you have taken is indeed classed as an overdose because it clearly is a dose larger than the max. recommended dose. Each and every person will react differently to an overdose of particular medication. Many things influence the outcome so nobody, even the best doctor, is able to predict with full confidence what overdose may do to you. So I am not able to tell you what your overdose may or may not have already done to you. You should go to a and e (emergency department at local hospital), tell them what happened and get checked out. Some things may take time to affect you so don't assume you are ok cause nothing happened yet. Liver damage is also something that may take several days to affect you significantly but by then it may be too late to help. Anyway... please do go check yourself out. Do not listen if someone says to you that they have taken more and they were ok... because each body will react differently each time... . It doesn't matter if your overdose was large or not by medical standards - it was an overdose nevertheless so you need to be checked out, really. I know fair share about overdosing, sadly, so please go check yourself out.</TEXT>

Basicaly regular psychiatric hospitals/wards have no proper long term therapy but there are facilities strickly for therapy too. Its hard to get a place but it is possible and these offer longer more structered individual therapy often also group therapy and occupational therapies like art pottery meditation music coping skills cooking... and many more. Also.. even if you tried many meds in many combos... there ARE meds and combos of meds you DID NOT try yet cause we both know there are thousands out there. What kind/type of meds did u try if u can remember? Also.. even if you did try therapy - you might have not met the right therapist yet. I...

    <TEXT>Hello My Friend. So... I thought since I have very extensive experience when it comes to psychiatric hospitals I would reply. First of all I would like to say that yes some psych wards are worse than others. I think it mostly depends on the staff. Basicaly what I personally think is the case is that if a big percentage of the staff in a ward is not passionate about their jobs or just simply have tendencies to not care and be lazy and rude or even be abusive at the worst then other staff that come as new to the ward fall mostly into similar bad attitude because they are influenced by others. So it really deoends what kind of a team the staff are together: nurses, doctors, mental health assistants, kitchen/cleaning staff, care coordinators, psychologists, ocupational therapists, pharmacists, ward managers, matrons, lead clinitians etc etc etc. Having said that no matter where you go you will always find that some staff are nicer/worse than others. Even when they surely do influence each other to become better and more proffesional or worse they still will all vary to an extent in those ways anyway. Now it may sound discouraging but let me tell you something. So... as much as there are some veeery bad places (psych wards) out there ... GENERALLY 95% OF THEM ARE NOT THE REALLY REALLY BAD TYPE. Most of all are just regular psych wards where you will find some awesome loving caring proffesional staff alongside ones a bit less caring and loving and perhaps an occassinal asshole/bitch. So like in any other real life seting: mixture of all kinds of people. That is REALLY the case with most psych wards. I think I would recommend you see first for yourself before you decide based on online reviews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well... Im sorry you feel this way. I wish for your sake you werent feeling so down and defeated but if I may just say one more thing: actualy ECT brings very quick results. In a short space of time patients report improvement. Also with EMDR the improvement is also reasonably quick in most cases but obviously not as quick as ECT. With medication it takes 2-3 months to see if particular thing work so as much as it is slower to help its still not that bad. Although the problem with medication is that you may have to try many different ones to find the one that helps so in that respect yes it can take a long time. But it doesnt have to. It depends. I mean... Im not trying to convince you to try things out because its your life and your choice. Im just saying there are things worth trying. When depressed and defeated it feels like nothing will help... I know. But that the illness taking over logical thinking...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are no safe overdose limits. Trust me. Don't believe anything you find on the internet or elsewhere about safe/non fatal overdose amounts/cases. The effects of od on individual body cannot be predicted even by the doctors. Yes, there are likelihoods - some amount of od may be less or more likely to kill but these likelihoods are, as the name suggests, not guarantees. There ARE exceptions. How individuals body will react to a particular overdose depends on more aspects than you can think of. I'll name few of them, I'll use "drug" as medicine: type of drug, amount of drug, the form of medicine (tablets, what type of tablets, short/long realised ones, intravenous or oral or other), general health of the individual, what medicine they're on and how much, past medical history, weight, age, how much and what and when they ate last, hydration levels, undiagnosed conditions they may not be aware of, whether it's a staggered overdose or not, what's the person's body tolerance for particular type of drug if any, how fast they get help, if they are actually going to get the right treatment for this particular overdose in time, what medical measures actually exist to help in particular od - if any, if the symptoms are managed well, previous condition of someones body ex liver kidney etc etc, even if they had a good night sleep and are rested and have the strength to cope with pressure put on the body by od or not..... And others. Let me just say: no matter how carefully you research the safe amount to od on there is always a chance you will not find it safe in your case. You may even do it few times and it ended up ok... But the next time it may not.</TEXT>

I don't wanna go into full on detailed explanation of what and how. The point is for example liver damage/failure takes sometimes some time to notcibly affect you. Go to the hospital. You need to be checked out. You may be ok - lucky... I hope you are and wish that for you. But there is a possibility you may not be ok - seek help.

    <TEXT>Absolutely brilliantly put together. Seriously - great job. Comprehensive, detailed, factual, on point. Couldn't ask for anything better - highly recommend to any self harmer. (Just to add something: in the guide you talk about how many hours after cutting the cut can be stitched after until it's 'too late' for stitching as healing process began. I am aware of these 'timelines' and only very recently at the a  amp; e while getting stitches I was told by a surgeon who was stitching me that it USED to be like that but these days they stitch ALL wounds that need to be stitched EVEN after the time period. It just is done differently then - they first scrape off outer layer etc. I don't know the whole process but that's what he did tell me. I proceeded to ask him more details, whether they would stitch wounds even after 3 days and he confirmed. Just thought to put it out there as it is news to me too and perhaps people should know about it too that they can seek help no matter how long it will take them to decide to get help/stitches.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll be honest with you... . I haven't worn in public anything except long sleeves and trousers since begging of 2013. I know that some people are ok with scars/wounds out but I am not. I tried to change it about myself but I can't. I hate when it's hot and I have to be in public. It's a nightmare. What I can recommend is buying sheer clothes. They provide coverage of skin but are as breathable as a long sleeve/leg can get. I'm sorry that you are struggling with this. I totally get your struggle with this.. . It is horrible not to be able to be comfortable. Also lots of clothes these days are 3/4 sleeves and these are also out of the question for me because my scars start lower than that. I like to wear vest tops and put a loose sheer material cover up on top. That's the best it gets. I hope that one day you will feel ok with your scars out in the open and also that you will get out of the self harm pit hole... . I wish that for you and am sending hugs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To answer your main question - no, as far as research that I know off goes people with OCD that involves intrusive thoughts about harming others in any way are very unlikely to actually do the things they fear, even further so - they are less likely to do these things purely because of the obsessional fear about these things. A lot of people suffering with OCD get these intense obsessive sometimes brutal thoughts and these are haunting them and understandably cause them a lot of distress. These thoughts are not representation of their hidden desires or instincts, quite the opposite actually.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think romanticising self harm is harmful because of multiple reasons but having said that I think that sometimes it comes from a good place, meaning trying to encourage self acceptance and love even while being scarred by self injury. At the same time reading this my mind brings up some of the most disgusting things about self harm that I have experienced... that are the opposite of art or beauty. I think of all those days spent in hospitals after overdoses when I was peeing all over myself before they put the catheters in... . I think of all the vomit, the acidic smell, the sound of constant retching. I think of blocked sinks and drains by the blood clots in my sink and shower that I had to use drain unblocker on and the smell of both the rotting blood and chemicals blending with each other. I think of the smell of wounds that are infected: the puss, the sebum, the decomposing particules of blood. I think of needing to ask my husband to help wipe my bum after using the toilet because of the wounds so severe I couldn't do it the normal way and in the end I had to use special disabled wiper for a while - the embarrassment, the shame, the ugly humiliation far FAR from beautiful. I could go on for a while longer bringing up the ugly side to this tragic problem and many other horrible things I go through, just like all of us here...but I think I made my point. It's ugly, it is so so ugly... . But then - I see a beauty in the moment when my husband kisses my scarred disfigured body and says he loves it all. So... I think the line between harmful romanticising self harm and actually encouraging unconditional love and acceptance despite the scars and them included...is not fixed, not always the same - it varies by context, the nature of relationship and much more... . I'm just sad that it made you upset and I do understand why (to the post's author). I would feel the same... I hope you are ok... . Sending hugs your way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was on Abilify for few weeks, maybe a month and I had terrible experience. It was in 2015 I think. The bad symptoms I remember were: feeling incredibly restless and fidggiting, feeling tension in my joints especially knees, inability to sleep deeply, tremors and uncontrollable body twitches, anxiety and pounding heart/palpitations, feeling nauseous. I hated it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am very proud of you.. I have the same struggles sadly so I totally relate. Today I am also proud of myself because I managed to help my husband in making a salad for lunch and also I managed to drink water more - which is a struggle of mine when my depression is bad. Are you keeping hydrated? I'm glad you managed to make the bed today. :) :) :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been self harming for 18 years in various forms (not only cutting). My self harming has been gradually getting worse over all those years. I had over 2000 stitches so far despite not going to get them done many times that I should. And yet... I have not been afraid of going too deep until very recently when my mental state has deteriorated even further and the self harm became even more extreme. Last time I self harmed 'properly' I had to have surgery on my arm, after one of my overdoses I was in a coma for two days, I spent countless months hospitalised etc etc etc. My obsessions about doing certain extreme self harm acts are getting very strong and now, finally, after all those years - I am truly truly afraid of what this illness will make me do next time the obsession gets the better of me... . I am paralised by fear of going to deep, taking too many, not getting the help on time. Will I survive? I sincerely don't know. Please please please, to anyone who is on that same journey but few steps back - save your life while you can. You may think you have everything under control, you may think you will stop at certain age certain moment certain depth, you may think it's just scars - it can become your end. Stop while you can, if you still can... .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There was time in my life when as a result of medical problems I experienced months of excruciating physical pain and it changed me. Pain like that changes a person. It's indescribable. From then on I fully support the right of people who suffer badly to die on their own terms. (Obviously lots of issues come into play like capacity, prognosis etc etc).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If he is a danger to himself or others or if lack of treatment may likely worsen his symptoms then you can have him committed/sectioned/hospitalised against his will. It works a bit differently in various countries but general guidelines are quite similar. Look it up how you could go about it in your country. It can potentially save his life and he will thank you once he is of more sound mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's hard to tell. The wound is not very long or not gaping but it might be deep enough to warrant a check up just in case if some internal structure was injured. Depends also what caused it. Stabbing kind of wounds can look small on the outside but be dangerous due to their initially unclear depth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two and a half weeks ago I was in general hospital for one week and had surgery on the self harm wounds I have done (cutting and some other stuff). I self harmed and my husband had to call the ambulance. It was a second surgery for self harm wound within the space of two months. Since then I have district nurses coming to my house everyday to change the dressings as well as psychiatric team visiting too to monitore my mental state on top of already weekly appointments with my doctor and constant contact with my psychiatric care coordinator. Today I was in hospital for a wound review and they removed stitches from the stitched areas but are concerned about the areas I harmed in different way (I don't want to share what I did to myself in case someone gets triggered). So because of this my wounds once again were put under the vac / suction machine to help with healing because they are just not doing well. The vac dressing and pump will be on for a while and now they put me also under plastics clinique in the hospital so I will have to also go there at least every two weeks for wound review and further treatment. And here is where I struggle... ! I don't get why everyone around me seems to be freaked out by the severity of my self harm, why everyone around me seems to be worried, why so many reasources and treatments are being used, why so many doctors/nurses are involved....... WHY ALL OF THIS IF I LOOK AT THESE WOUNDS AND DON'T SEE THEM AS THIS BAD AS EVERYONE ELSE CLAIMS?!?!? I can see they are somewhat serious but it seems like I don't get the full picture! Like I am desensitised to it. WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?! WHY CAN'T I SHOCK MYSELF INTO STOPPING AND INSTEAD I MAKE IT WORSE EACH TIME!? I don't trust my judgement any more... . I'm sorry for all the details but I just feel lost with all of this - I feel like I live in a different world than people around me because they see reality differently than me. I feel lost and odd.. . Will I ever validate my wounds?! I get all the validation anyone would need from all of the fuss around it but I physically don't see what they see so I don't give myself any validation. I REALIZE THAT ANY VALIDATION FROM OUTSIDE IS IRRELEVANT IF THERE IS NO VALIDATION FROM WITHIN.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your post. It came at a perfect time for me because I was contemplating this exact issue today and I even made a post about it on another Sub Reddit.

    <TEXT>You can go to a and e and be seen by a doctor. The a and e doctor will request for you to be seen there in a and e by someone from psych team. A person with mental health training from psych team will then come (sooner or later) and have a conversation with you about the reasons you are there and your background and any other relevant information like medications diagnosis family history etc. Obviously they will ask you if you are suicidal as well as questions relating to that. They will ask about delusions/hallucinations/voices etc. They will ask about thoughts of harming yourself or others. If they admit you and in what way (voluntarily or section) will depend on symptoms you experience, the insight you have into your issues as well as things like social/family situation etc etc etc. Basically many factors matter. If they deem you require psychiatric admission for either purpose of diagnosis or purpose of safe guarding etc then they will arrange that and you may have to wait for a while for them to do so (even few days in hospital sometimes). Obviously they will also decide what type of ward you may be admitted to.</TEXT>

I started at the age of 12 with small scratches. Now I need surgeries or 250+ stitches or treatment for overdoses etc etc etc - the list is extensive. The decline is insane...

It's comforting yet sad and scary at the same time and I am sorry for anyone that goes through it. It's crazy how for some people sh story ends well and for some...well...it ends with the person or not at all.. thank you for kindly replying to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks again for your time to reply to me. I've taken on board everything you've said. The other night I was hysterical because I couldn't shake off the thought that my self harm will kill me one day, directly or indirectly. And I am not wanting to die. But by now I have totally no control over my self harm once it gets to the breaking point. I'm afraid that even if I will survive the action itself I may die during surgery and general anesthesia needed to fix my self harm wounds because I have health problems that make general anaesthetic more dangerous for me. I worry about that as well as other scenarios where self harm will be the end of me.... . It's so scary, frightening... . :( Do you worry about stuff like that?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wrists/ankle restraints VS close observation (1:1 ; 2:1 etc).</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-22 18:43:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Have any of you been put in wrists/ankles restraints and what was your experience of it? It's something that came to my mind today because I was reflecting on how I feel about these types of restraints (belts/ties) versus being put on so called 'close observation' (UK terminology) or in other words 1:1 2:1 and so on (1, 2 or more members of staff with you at arms length at all times). I experienced both many times (UK and Poland) so I was reflecting on good sides and down sides to both when comparing them to each other based on my personal experiences. Any thoughts about the comparison of the two? I'm asking all, whether you experienced it personally or not.</TEXT>
