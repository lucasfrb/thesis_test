    <TEXT>Self harming can be an addiction, and even though you might not  #8220;need #8221; it anymore, you #8217;ll still be used to it and maybe the sense of comfort it gives you. Having people who support you through recovery can help a lot Winning over the strongest of urges, is a step closer to recovery. Getting past addictions is really a strong support system and a will to change it Make small goals, it #8217;s okay if you sometimes relapse. That #8217;s a part of recovery I am wishing you good luck, and stay safe. You can do this</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-19 07:01:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>i really need to know, the only thing that #8217;s motivating me is the thought of summer rapidly approaching. i want to stop but i don #8217;t want to stop, and i feel so lost because i can #8217;t tell anyone or find help. and i know i am going to have scars, both barely visible and very prominent, but i #8217;d so much rather have that than my current scabbed over/fresh, dried blood covered cuts. i #8217;m so lost and split</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Supposedly recovered over a year ago</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-02 18:08:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>This might be a bit long, I #8217;ll include a TL;DR at the end. Possibly trigger warning. My eating habits worsened winter to spring in 2018 (2 years ago at this point), which was later diagnosed as anorexia. I lost a shit ton of weight, my grades dropped hard, and living was honestly suffocating. Spending every waking second thinking about food and my size was almost like a trance. Happily wasting so much of my time writing all my safe foods, rules, and calorie amounts in notes on my phone, thousand upon thousand of words. I still have them. Before I spiralled, I was what would probably be considered very normal weight, and the change happened quite quickly, so people were fast to notice something was up. My parents tried getting me to eat, but it wasn #8217;t cutting it. I was lying and deceiving them, acting like I wasn #8217;t aware what was happening, but it just kept going downhill, so they took me to some professionals who then diagnosed me with anorexia. My thoughts were so cloudy from my body barely having any energy, but I still picked up the professionals #8217; tactics, looked up the books they were reading and kept feigning ignorance. I hated watching my weight go up, but I pretended it was fine. I found the meal plans they were using so I could calculate the calories. I lied about counting calories, I lied about not thinking I was fat, I lied about feeling better. I pretended to be fine with it, to have had some sort of epiphany and realisation that this eating disorder maybe wasn #8217;t the best idea, and that it was quite dangerous! But in reality it was just part of my plan to relapse as soon as they turned their eyes away. At some point though, I #8217;m pretty sure I was so fucking miserable that another part of my head just decided to say fuck it. To stop fighting so hard against a war I wasn #8217;t gonna win. The thought of relapsing when they turned away still existed in my mind though, it was still my plan. I was gaining weight, I was eating  #8220;normally #8221;, and the professionals decided it maybe hadn #8217;t been an eating disorder at all, because I just kept lying that everything was fine, that I didn #8217;t care. I did care. And there it was, I was supposedly recovered. Ate normally, weighed a normal weight, had a normal relationship with food. Except I didn #8217;t, there were so many times I tried going back, but the anxiety of my family finding out and disappointing my friends was just too much, so I just kept pretending it was fine. I still feel fear looking at certain foods, I still sometimes have breakdowns after eating, I still sort of restrict. I still watch my weight, I still do body checks and I keep slipping into that mindset. I #8217;m not as bad as I was then, but even if it #8217;s over for everyone I know, it isn #8217;t yet for me. I #8217;m still fucking haunted by the thoughts, the calories, and I still get so triggered when I hear about eating disorders and people in eating disorders. It #8217;s both from never wanting to feel like that again and wishing it was me. I hated myself when my weight at some point went above a set number, so I semi- #8220;starved #8221; myself so it would go back down, and I couldn #8217;t and can #8217;t help feeling so satisfied when the number drops. I just want more. I still avoid foods, or eating everything on my plate, or having weird habits, and eating when I feel a bit full makes me feel so fucking disgusting. I #8217;m supposed to be recovered, but my thoughts haven #8217;t. I #8217;m in hell. I hate the days where I spiral and break down and can #8217;t bring myself to eat because I #8217;m terrified of becoming fat, but I can #8217;t starve because I #8217;m afraid people will think I #8217;ve relapsed. There is no rest or timeout. It really feels like I #8217;m on dry, solid ground, but there #8217;s water in my lungs, and I #8217;m still drowning. I #8217;ll never really be free, will I? Thank you for reading my rant, and if you didn #8217;t, that #8217;s okay, too. I just needed it out. TL;DR got an eating disorder, then professional help where I just lied, back to my normal weight but my thoughts are still disordered</TEXT>

    <TEXT>without a doubt, it will be a big deal. read through a few of the posts on this subreddit and you #8217;ll see. forever and ever these people are haunted by this fact, that they couldn #8217;t save their friend, or lover, or family member, or even a stranger. no matter how much your brain tells you nobody will care, they will. people will care people bereaved by suicide will have to live with it forever, it #8217;s not something that passes from one day to the next. they have lost not only someone else, but also a part of themselves. death is already painful as is, but suicide hurts all the more because there is the inevitable feeling that it might have been preventable. maybe if they had said something different, if they had noticed, if they had just smiled to that person a little more, perhaps today that person might still have been alive. but no matter how much you regret and how much you wish you had done something differently, it won #8217;t change that they #8217;re gone, and that they now only live as a memory in their loved ones. some would give up everything to talk to their best friend, or their sister, or their mother, or their father, or their brother, or their wife, or their husband, or their cousin, or their uncle, or their aunt, or their grandparent just one last time. one last time it is absolutely soul crushing to hope for someone to return that you KNOW never will. they still write to their phones, listen to their voicemails, look at their old pictures in hopes that it #8217;ll revive some part of them. they #8217;ll never feel their breath, or their touch or hear their voice or smell their scent ever again the same way. people do care and people will care so im begging you, please don #8217;t take your life, both from yourself, but also from your loved ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i #8217;m sorry to hear that, it sounds hard :( my brain sometimes reopens the wound of the memories. i shouldn #8217;t feel this way about it, and last time was over a year ago it but the feeling still burns on my ribs, hips, thighs, bottom and the absolute worst area, my neck. its gotten worse these last couple of days i want to say it somewhere, though i dont really have anywhere to say it, but if you look at my drawings they tend to focus on those areas, specifically neck. it stings, i wish i could remove the areas sorry, im rambling. thank you for your comment</TEXT>
