    <TEXT>You basically will never leave low pri, even if you are only in there because of disconnect like me (had important real life things to attend). The fact that both teams have to have someone present just doesnt make any sense at all. 15 minutes in, our team is winning through skill and communication etc. and 1 person leaves on enemy team, then after 1 minute the all go. How can you even leave if thats the system? Now i have more of these bullshit games, which makes me flame my team more and become more toxic in general because its impossible to escape. Something that i will probably carry over to normal games because low pri has made me this way now. GG volvo Edit: Dont even get me started on the loading times, 5 minutes to find a match, 3 minutes to wait whilst someone doesnt connect --- gt; rinse repeat</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oracle and Wisp. I haven't ever seen these 2 combo together. But I can imagine if the Wisp is tethered to Tiny for example, and overcharges, Oracle can then start stacking Purifying Flames until Wisp gets 3 of them stacked. This would heal Wisp for 132 health per second, which of course heals the Tiny. Imagine these 3 heroes with lets say a Tide for teamfight/counter initiate (in case the enemy team jumps the wisp) and also Invoker, again for similar reasons + alacrity. The tower siege would indeed, be real. For even more Kappa HackzNeedNerf you can replace Tiny for Lone Druid and tether/alacrity the Spirit Bear. Thanks for listening and remember, pls don't try this in Pubs!</TEXT>

If you have spent 200 hours on dota, you have queued for 10 hours. 1000 hours, and queued for 50. 4000 hours and you will have queued for as long as the 200 hours person has spent altogether!

    <DATE>2016-04-08 12:46:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>http://imgur.com/Lb4mlc2 How's about instead of coming out in a straight line, it comes out at two 45 degree angles, that are 90 degrees to themselves, as shown. This makes perfect sense since he has, and I'm sure you've noticed, two heads. This would also buff Jakiro somewhat as he needs it, because there is two damage sources. However it wouldn't be so strong because both of them are not massively likely to all hit targets. It could still be used like before when you ice path and ult but you would have to rotate the model 45 degrees before ulting. Maybe give a slight turnrate buff to compensate!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Yet Another Brood Aghs Idea</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-15 17:54:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>http://imgur.com/TmEoVhB Basically Brood gets another ability, which when activated sends out some sort of poison that travels along her webs, starting from her location. Webs that aren't connected will not receive the poison. The damage increases the further the poison travels, on a web by web basis. For example starts off at 300 damage, and gets an additional 30 or so per web (maybe 20) for a total of 510 damage. The poison will travel at around maybe 500-600 movement speed Cooldown should probably be at least 60 seconds Thanks for reading :)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-04-23 10:02:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>* Idea 1) Storm Spirit gains a % of INT as bonus damage with overload - maybe around 50%. So if he has 100 int, overload will do 90 (at lvl 4) + (50% of 100) 50 = 140. Adds quite a bit of damage. * Idea 2) Storm Spirit gains an overload charge upon active item use. This means the typical hex, orchid, dagon, bkb etc. will gain storm spirit a charge, thus increasing overall damage output. * Idea 3) Combine then both, whilst reducing the amount of % based INT damage from idea 1. More like 20-30% instead of 50%. Of course the old charming lightning guy needs to reappear in the meta first before this could be really useful. ^^^Storm ^^^Spirit ^^^Armlet ^^^new ^^^meta</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ember Aghs Idea</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-24 15:44:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok a few different suggestions: 1) Applies the current level of searing chains to every unit hit by sleight of fist. (sounds OP but this build would surely revolve less around stacking mass battle fury and damage) 2) Remove the limit to flame remnants, but keep a 1-2 second cooldown so spamming isnt allowed. Still high burst and lots of vision (LUL JK) 3) Allows flame guard to be permanently on, but removes the magic shield. Essentially gives a radiance effect that hopefully stacks with radiance which would be cool. Keep in mind these are 3 DIFFERENT ideas, not all the same for a single aghs upgrade!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-22 08:35:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So one time i was looking online for a new book and happened across Mistborn. I just bought the entire trilogy and loved it. Next i read stormlight archive, both WoK and WoR and loved them. Next was legion and emperors soul, then Elantris then Warbreaker. I know some people probably spazzed out at the awful order of everything but i want to know what to read next. Im currently re reading mistborn, and starting on the alloy book next. Ive also read Reckoners. Please help me decide what next, whether it be a whole novel or a short story online that i should read (obviously to do with cosmere). Thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-09-05 10:04:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Turns Sprint into a allied Hero/Creep targeted ability with a slightly lowered cooldown. In addition, the current level of Bash also gets applied with sprint. This stacks with Slardar's current Bash. (Maybe not both bash chance and bonus damage, might be too OP). This will give Slardar some team oriented contribution, similar to Dark Seer's Surge, but is slightly more focused on buffing carries, due to the bash ability being applied.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hero if Ages Hoid reference (Spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-07 15:20:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Mistborn trilogy, I only ever recognised 1 Hoid reference, obviously in the first boom as the begger Kelsier met. However in the Hero of Ages, reading it a second time, I was wondering if "Durn" the fellow beggar Spook was paying for information could also have been Hoid. The main clue is the reference to his perfect rhythm. Also the little clue about counting the skulls. Can anyone confirm this?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-18 16:15:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically, an item that had a small AOE, much like Riki smoke cloud (maybe smaller) that mutes most enemy Hero's items. I'm not sure what the components would be, honestly could be anything as long as the item costs like 4k+ gold for balancing. This would be really helpful for Clock for example, so when he catches Drow, Sniper etc. they can't just Hurricane Pike out. Also, BKB and some other items are immune from the mute!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So im probably around 900% of the way to getting 1001%. Mostly some challenges left and The Keeper post it notes. I want to play plus on my afterbirth save file but then i would only be around 700% done and it seems that the game is way harder. If i use my afterbirth save file for plus will i ever be able to go back to just afterbirth to get the 1001% whenever i want?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some things I'd like to say about final boss (spoilers obviously)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-04 14:05:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw some people complaining about the lack of animation or how it is unoriginal. For me, I LOVE the concept of the final floor, how huge it is and the different bosses to fight. I will say that it could have its own textures and room layouts rather than copying the originals. The boss fight though was amazing! I managed to beat it first time (mostly because of broken stopwatch and Mom's Knife/Brimstone synergy). The whole point is that it is playing to Isaac's worst fears, and imitating all the previous bosses. The original Delirium is meant to embody a disturbed state of mind (ie. Isaac) and the whole illusions of other bosses plays into this. It has no animation of it's own but I love the fact that it appears as other bosses, but in it's unique way. Was a really fun boss fight honestly. Also the ending scene was nice :) [2 Spooky](http://i.imgur.com/xdCOprU.png)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've done some basic Java and C# but I can't figure Lua out. I can write what I want in Pseudo Code and hopefully someone can assist me! Basically the item will be like Russian Roulette and an active item. Whenever you use it, either a random enemy or yourself will take damage. It does a full heart of damage to yourself and i'm not exactly sure on the enemy damage so let's say 100. function useFeelingLuckyItem() local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0); local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities() for i = 1, #entities do if (entities[i]:IsVulnerableEnemy()) then (now for pseudo code) Random.Range(1.0f, 6.0f) if (number between 1 and 5, damage enemy for 100) else (damage player for 1 heart)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the pseudo code but I have no idea how to structure any of it. When you use the active item: math.random(0, #entities) get a random number between 0 and the number of entities for example 5. if (0) then Isaac takes 1 heart damage So if the result is 0, then Isaac will be damaged. else math. random(entity) takes damage if it's anything else, for example if there are 5 enemies then 1 to 4 would result in a random enemy taking damage. If there is just the player and a boss, then there is a 50% chance that the player gets hurt. If there are 10 enemies, then its 10% chance player gets hurt.</TEXT>

One time a Devil Deal spawned. This can't just be bad luck can it? I donate 10 coins for the extra Angel chance but I never get it. 4 runs I had to restart because of this shit.

Like, the hackers wait for people to specifically download this anti malware, then record them or search their files for something? It seemed like most of the episode was gearing towards the final fight between 2 pedos, with the woman storing the keys in the tyre before Kenny even becomes involved. So were the hackers at that time, specifically looking for someone like Kenny, who is a pedo? What if he downloaded a different anti malware?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Few ideas</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-18 18:50:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>1) Not sure what the new character will be, but I thought a necromancer could work well. Maybe like Lillith in Isaac, you can't attack yourself, and have low hp. However you can summon units in which the enemies have to destroy first before damaging you. An example could be a starter minion with 10 health and 4 damage. Every turn you can attack with it, and it will cost energy. You can also play cards that buff your minions (# strength) or give block to them. Cards will be different types of minions, different stats or supports such as healers or debuffers. It would take a while to balance butcould be fun! 2) Also, I think maybe a bank in the shop, in which you can add some gold, lets say 100. Maybe 50 or so can be tax, which makes it good but not too strong. 3) Another idea is maybe a blind debuff, where you can see the energy, but not the cards so you have to hope you play the right ones :)</TEXT>

Then I ran into another system of pirates and they had around 20 ships and total power of like 12000. What are you supposed to do??</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/7hny76j Make it Rain - Can be purchased in shop, neutral card. Maybe cost 100 gold. Comes with a curse. Cost 1 energy and deals 10 damage. It also deals damage depending on the amount of gold the player has divided by 50, to all enemies. For example, 10 damage to 1 enemy, and if you have 300 gold, does 6 damage to all enemies . I suppose it rounds up, so if you had 299 gold, also does 6 damage. Maybe the upgrade can be more damage. Or the card can cost 2 energy and upgrade make it 1. https://imgur.com/yPoCyFe The curse is called Greed and can be removed, but not from the shop where Make it Rain is bought. Whenever the card appears, lose 10 gold. Maybe 20 if 10 isnt bad enough. All these numbers are arbitrary, can be changed to balance them!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm watching Northernlion and he hasn't yet unlocked the wall jump. He's gone to Ancient Sewers the first time using the down smash rune. Now, I'm on 2 boss cells, and I 100% unlocked wall jump before down smash. Yet when I checked wiki, it says wall jump unlocked in Slumbering Sanctuary. So how did I get wall jump before down smash? There is no way to get to Slumbering Sanctuary without down smash or wall jump. It doesn't make sense?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to win when 80% of games I lose because of bad team drafting?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-12 09:52:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I usually pick offlane, because it isn't contested by other players as much as mid or carry. But I sometimes will solo support, because nobody else picked a support and I want stronger lanes. The offlane is a lot harder now so it's harder for me to have huge impacts when I'm struggling to get any exp at all. This is how my games usually go: I am solo offlane, against 3 heroes, complete death if I go near exp. I do the best I can whilst pulling and staying in fog/trees. Meanwhile, my team trilane at top are doing nothing to zone out enemy offlaner, they aren't pulling or harassing. Maybe they go gank mid and fail that too. Also, my mid player is getting destroyed 1v1. This all culminates to a horrible mid game for us where we get deathballed and nobody can defend. I have never been 5k because I keep slowly getting to 4.9k then lose like 5 games in a row due to the nature of this post. It feels like I have a 30% chance to win from the start because my teammates are around 4k, and the enemy team plays like they are 6k. In addition, even though starved for exp and farm, I usually have by far the highest impact on my team. If I play Phoenix, I manage to get 90% of ults off onto 3 heroes or so. I really need help because I feel I should be high 5k, and I just can't get passed 5000</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-05 14:32:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have GTX 1050m with 128GB SSD and 4GB VRAM. Yet I can barely run No Man's Sky on medium with 40-50 FPS. I bought this so I could get at least high on 60 FPS. Another issuse is that I have 2 drives. The C and D. There is only 105 GB on C, and hald was already used when launching laptop first time. The D has 931 GB. Steam always creates in C:ProgramFiles(86x) but I won't have room, need around 400GB. Now, I tried to put Steam on C, and only have 1 or 2 games at a time there, and the rest stored on D. I assume my SSD operates in C. (Not really sure how it works.) That was why it was running worse on D. I did this and no change happened, still very low FPS for the kind of Graphics card I have. It's barely better than my old laptop (860m with 2GB VRAM) Please help!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-13 19:45:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right at the start of the fight, the error happens and I'm left facing it solo. I've completed the quest the 1st time solo but wanted to kill it again for a better Insect Glaive. About 25 minutes in I realised the difficulty was still for 4 players, I hadn't destroyed its tail and it was barely injured. It was super hard to attack because I had to constantly get the 3 insects, as well as sharpening my weapon and healing and tracking it when it flees. I fainted twice and almost a 3rd time but finally managed to kill it in 43 minutes. Barely broke it at all, but a 3some of Great Jagra and Tobi-Kadachi helped. It was around 4000 points, but -1000 for dying x2 = only 2000 left. Then it was divided by 4 for players so I only got 500 :( But it was mainly for the materials anyway, just an annoying bug.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Low FPS on good Laptop?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-27 09:20:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my old Laptop, which had GTX 860m could run the game medium 80 FPS or so. But I always played on low and got 100 FPS (so fans didn't go as crazy) However I got a new Laptop, GTX 1050 and now I can run it on ultra at 90 FPS or so. The problem is that as the game goes on, the FPS gets lower, and during some fights it goes to below 60. This type of game, less than 60 FPS can lose you fights. So I changed the graphics to high, then medium, then low and got like 10 FPS higher altogether. I don't understand how even on low, I only get 70 FPS or so on an almost 2x better Laptop. It's like some data is being saved as the game goes on, and somehow affects the FPS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've been playing Overwatch for around 2 months and last season I got around 1700 rank. I think I won 2 or 3 games and lost the rest of the 10 placement. This time, I have improved immensely and mostly used Brigitte and Rein, of which I always dominated and got many golds. I won 7 out of the 10 placement matches, and yet my rank this time is around 1600. How can it be 100 lower, when I won at least 4 more games, and had like 10 times more impact in those games? I don'd understand. How exactly is the rank calculated?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Meepo is so easily countered, so useless</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-06 11:06:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I had a really good deck around Meepo and buffing heroes and allies. Only played versus expert bots but I won fairly easily against some of the more annoying decks, ones that had Axe or Lich in them. But I hadn't realised just how bad Meepo actually was when until I played against upkeep kill deck. My Meepo was in the fountain almost the entire game. Mostly due to Thundergods Wrath 1 shotting any Meepo without items. If that wasn't enough, Tinker's laser 1 shot him, the 7 mana piercing cannon basically 1 shot him (does 4 damage but also 1 from ignite). Maybe I just got super unlucky with card draws, the bot seemed to get all Ignite, all Thundergods, and so many insane improvements. I also didn't draw quite a few of my really good cards. The main issue was that even when I had given 2 Meepos Stonehall Cloaks, the other 1 I had out just died instantly cos only 5 hp. Maybe give Meepo 6 or 7 default hp, and also make Poof deal damage from the lane where he Poofed from, as well as the one he Poofs to, just like in Dota. It's only 2 damage anyway, kinda sucks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bit of a rant post sorry. So I am 4.7K mmr, and I think my mechanical skill is around this, maybe 5k or so. However my game awareness and decision making is very much 6-7k I feel. This is 1 area in which I excel in gaming in general, I have always been good at games. Whenever watching pro games in the past, and you used to not be able to see what players would buy, I would predict the item almost always. Remember Winter being good at that, I was correct along with him very much of the time. I always have a feeling when the enemy is at Rosh, or ganking, or hiding in the trees. This is something I almost never see my teammates doing, but is consistent in pro games. However, my mechanical skill isn't that good. I have trouble clicking my inventory very fast, like dropping something to grab Aegis. And targeting enemies super fast can be quite difficult too. However I still do good things, like ht 3 man chronos consistently, or dive, halberd and fire spirit 3 different enemies and get my egg off. I generally play offlane and always make sure to go for bounties, and buy items like Pipe, Vessel, Vlads. And when I play support I always get force and glimmer. My teammates almost never get any of these items and it's ridiculous. I can't gain mmr when my team doesn't know basic teamplay. However the enemy team always buys the right items and plays correctly it seems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haven't played much but haven't seen any rivers. They seem like they would be very aesthetically pleasing and super cool snaking down from higher up. There could be animals and fish in there, like Piranhas that attack the player. And things like clams or pearls that can be used for something. Would be cool to build bridges over them. And possibly use them as a source of power, like a Hydro-Electric dam.</TEXT>
