    <TEXT>My first couple weeks as a police officer I responded to a medical unconcious call in my beat. Call comments stated boyfriend woke up next to his fiance and she was cold. I was first on scene and the image of relief the young kid had on his face is unforgetable as I rushed into his house to adminster CPR while my trainer took him outside. Fire department came 5 minutes after to take over life saving efforts. The other face that is unforgetable was when I told him his 24 year old fiance passed away while she slept. Being a cop is hard sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bodies are easy if you can dehumanize it. It's easy to roll a dead body or see someone's head blown off until the family rolls on scene and freaks out. Seeing a guy blow his brains with a 12 gauge wasn't as bad as seeing an 80 year old woman kissing her newly deceased husband as the medical examiner rolls him out of the room.

    <TEXT>I responded to a call of a maid finding a person who had shot himself. We get on scene and theres a trail of blood leading from the living room with swiped hand marks from someone trying to crawl. We eventually find his body in a separate room with the right side of his head blown off. He had a pile of blood soaked clothes which looked like he tried to clean up his mess. Investigation discovered that he was in hundreds of thousands dollars of debt and decided to kill himself with a shotgun. He put the barrel in his mouth but as he pulled the trigger he flinched causing the barrel to more slightly to the right. He missed his brain and blew out the back right side of his head. Because the barrel was in his mouth the gases trying to escape blew out his eyes. He crawled around his house fully functional trying to clean up his mess without being able to see. While bleeding out. It was horrific and I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got a call about a maid finding her client dead in his room from an apparent gun shot wound. We get there and found him laying in a pool of blood with a shotgun across the room from him. When the gas of a shotgun is trying to escape your mouth it goes out any orface it can. His eyes exploded from the sockets and there were several pools of blood/hand prints around the room. There was also a white towell covered in blood across from him. Investigation revealed that he put the shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He flinched last second blowing one side of his head off. Blind and probably deaf he crawled around his room for maybe 30 seconds in agony. Looks like he even tried to clean it up with the towell. Shit gives me nightmares thinking about the terror this man was suffering in the last seconds of his life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Local PD here... Generally, monitored security services are scams. Expect a ten minute response once activated activation is had and maybe a  gt;1% chance of just an alarm system getting your stuff back. Cameras are your best option since a picture/video of bad guy swiping your stuff is fantastic evidence for identification. That picture will be shared with all local PDs and surely end up in a identified bad guy. Stay safe!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Earlier in my life I had sudden cardiac arrest. I ended up being transported to the hospital and put in a hypothermic coma. The reason for the coma is that I was without oxygen for 6 minutes and they were worried I damaged my organs. I woke up 5 days after the incident but don't have any recollection until 10 days after. My experience with amnesia is non existant but my wife's is. She tells me for those five days I would wake up and have a conversation with her and be the same person I always was. We'd watch a movie and I'd fall asleep. However after waking up she would have to go through explaining what happened to me again and we'd watch the same move that I swore I had never seen. I guess it's a case by case thing and some people react to brain trauma. The doctors were sure that I was going to stay that away and scared my family to death.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[WTT] KAC SR15 14.5 inch upper, Vortex Razor 1-10 MIL, Badger Ordnance C1 mount, HOLOSUN 503R Offset. (AZ)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-04 17:56:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would like to trade my KAC SR15 MOD 2 complete upper, with a Vortex Optics 1-10 Mil reticle mounted in a badger ordnance C-1 mount with a Holosun 503R. The Holosun is the Aimpoint T1 clone with the multi reticle system. The upper has about 200 rounds through it and is complete minus the iron sights. The Vortex and Holosun are flawless and I have receipts for everything listed. Upper also currently has an INFORCE WML and a magpie AFG. I also have the KAC buffet that I won #8217;t be needing anymore. What I would like to trade for... NIGHTVISION. I need to seize the night and have come to the conclusion that I #8217;m probably not gonna shoot past 50m anyways. Trade value by my count is probably around $4200. Would love to do a local trade somewhere in Arizona but am open to the right deal. https://imgur.com/a/UJha2hS</TEXT>
