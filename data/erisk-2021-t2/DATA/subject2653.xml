    <TEXT>I'm rereading Deathly Hallows for the umpteenth time, and just got to the part where Ron's been splinched due to Hermione's hasty apparition. This got me thinking: Could a wizard kill someone by purposefully splinching their head off via apparating with them?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-14 15:28:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the book when Scrimgeor explains Dumbledore's will, there's a part where he asks Hermione if she seeks work in magical law, to which she replies "no, I want to do some good in this world". I vividly remember this was in the movie, as people in the theater laughed and clapped, and since then I've watched the movie many times. And yet when I watched it again today, that scene was nowhere to be found.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why can't you leave a fentanyl transdermal patch for longer than 72 hours?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-17 17:48:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let's forget for a second that the patch can take up to 24 hours to take effect, effectively making ita 48 hour patch; let's talk numbers. For instance, the 50mcg/hour patch contains 8.25mg of fentanyl. But if you take 50mcg and multiply it by 72, you get 3.6mg. So what the hell is all that extra fentanyl doing there? Why not leave it for 6-7 days in order to get your full patch's worth? What am I missing here?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-03 16:02:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's what I'm thinking: * Cook a patch with the method from [this](http://www.aivl.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Injecting-Fentanyl-Minimising-The-Risks.pdf) guide. * Mix it with saline and put that solution in a nasal sprayer. Would that work? Yes, I realize I'll be losing a lot of bioavailability, but I don't do needles. And wearing it didn't anything for me, smoking it feels like ruining it (tried, I'm a noob) and gumming it wasn't all that great for me either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I cooked a patch strip with citric acid, resulting in a solution of 2.5ml which I filtered, then added 2.5ml saline and IM'd it into my upper arm (where you get vaccines). It was 15 minutes ago and already started taking effect. Af first my entire arm was hurt and sore like a mother, but now.... it's actually nice. I have an inkling that the reason it's no longer hurting and sore was due to fent's analgesic properties. Either way, I'm feeling nice and warm and itchy (but not too itchy). Overall not a bad experience. I still have an entire 50ug/h patch (containing 8.25mg fent) which I intend to cook with citric acid, mix with saline and pour it into a nasal sprayer. Will definitely update you guys.</TEXT>
