    <TEXT>Whenever I play against a Snake, 99% of the time they'll recovery as high as possible with their up-b. It seems like I should be able to punish it since it can only take 8%, but they either armor through my moves or soar past. I've seen many top-level snakes do this too. Is there a reason why it works and why is it good?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Quickplay Cloud starter pack:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-06 14:36:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Fucking Up-B out of shield when you're within a fucking mile of his shield Can't punish the Up b because he either lands on the top platform of battlefield or somehow hits you from behind with his stupid ass hitbox Cross slash. Did it hit? Cross slash again. Did it get blocked? Cross slash again, works every time. This move deals 23% and more with limit. Blade beam. Time to beat the b button 20 times per second the millisecond you're offstage or on the ledge. Forward smash. Spam this whenever they're at kill percent. Fuck it, spam it when they're not at kill percent. It's got so much range and such a quick animation you'll inevitably get hit by it and die at 50. Up smash. Yet another gigantic fast out of shield option that has no right being as strong as it is. Cloud players will start mashing up on the c stick the moment you're above them as if if they mash it enough their dad will come home. Dash attack. Predictable as fuck but you still somehow get hit by it or can't punish it because online makes everything safe on shield Aerials. Now, these are rare from the average porridge-brained quickplay cloud players, but every so often they'll chuck out a bair that covers more empty space than his actual fucking sword and get yeeted off stage Limit: It's a good thing all quickplay clouds have an IQ of 10 combined, because god forbid they actually use limit properly. They'll either bum-rush you with limit cross slash because they genuinely think you didn't see it coming, and get it blocked by your shield, upon which they will frantically roll in the other direction because they didn't know it was actually safe on shield. (What the fuck, Nintendo? At least I can actually punish double edged dance.) Every so often they'll try and get you with the finishing touch in order to trick themselves into thinking they're hype and good at the game, only to miss by the length of Antarctica. Doesn't stop them from trying it over and over again, however. Limit Blade beam is a pain in the ass to deal with because you could see that move coming from 4 light-years away and still get hit by it, because Nintendo thought it was a good idea to make a massive projectile faster, stronger and hit multiple times. Up-B part two because I genuinely feel like punching the buttfucking brains out of this move. It's not the fastest up-b in the game, but the hitbox is so fucking big that spacing ceases to exist. Unless you're playing Shulk, don't even think about spacing or crossing up because you'll manage to either get hit by the front hitbox, which is approximately te size of the truck, or the back (what the fuck Nintendo) hitbox which still combos into the later hitboxes. I recently entered an online tournament where I got knocked into loser's semis for playing against a laggy braindead cloud from two continents over who only used about 5 moves. I'll finish this rant by touching upon the fact that Cloud's design is the blandest in the entire game. I get it. He's a fundies character. A fundies character that actually utilizes none of the fundies and gets rewarded for losing and pressing buttons. Quickplay clouds who play degenerately, please, do us a favor and get an ethernet connection and actually try and improve at the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Crazy how people didn't like Min Min and byleth because they were 1st party and "dead games" and yet people want a minor side character from a spin off-1st party game and a even more minor side character that only appeared in like 2 1st party games and a couple of spinoffs. It's so boring listening to people say who they want for smash because its like "omG i HoPE DoOmGuY, MaSteRchEiF, cRaSh, 2B, aND gEnO gets in" the stalest picks you could possibly choose. What about something unorthodox like Pirahna plant, or unique like Hero? Why discard amazing potential picks for the sake of popularity, memes and nostalgia?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-09 04:46:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>SH flame breath. Wow you're so cool for pressing two buttons in a row and getting 30+ percent off of it. Side B everywhere. The reach on this thing is so fucking long I thought I was playing against Min Min. Shit's frame 6, deals 20% and kills you. Speaking of frame 6 moves, up b. Why they decided to give the heaviest character in the fucking game a fast run speed and oos option is beyond me. You could be playing Shulk and space an aerial so that the tip of the monado hits and still get caught by the gigantic sliding sharp cutscene. Also, good luck trying to edgeguard it because the spikes will power through any attack you throw at it. Smash attacks. These are ridiculous. Forward smash breaks shields, has super armor and fucking INVINCIBILITY, has a humongous hitbox and will kill you at 10. Up smash. Free anti air that is stupid strong, has insane reach and has FUCKING INVINCIBILITY. Down smash is the fastest, has large reach, kills, hits behind him, and has super armor. Fuck bowser's smash attacks. Down B: They'll use this the millisecond you knock them above them and come zooming down at Mach 3 to deal 23% and knock you into the stratosphere. Oh, and don't shield because if you get hit by it while shielding you can kiss your stock goodbye. Down air: Free landings! Used to get down as fast as possible and annoy the shit out of you. The side hitbox is bigger than magic burst and will clip you across the stage. It will kill you at 90 and deals 20 fucking percent. Forward air: What a stupid move. It's got so much reach that you it makes Cloud and Marth piss their pants. It's fast, autocancels, deals 16% and kills. It's also a free edgegaurd because you can just run off the stage and swat at your opponent and kill them at 60. Back air: See forward smash. Up throw: Fucking annoying. He grabs you, spins you around for what feels like forever, and then manages to true combo you to deal an easy 27%. Might as well throw your DI out the window because nothing will save you from the gigantic forward and up airs. Bowser players are toxic as fuck and will t bag over their undeserved kill. He's one of the easiest characters to play and also one of the most braindead. I could hand a controller to a patient in a coma and they'd be able to win games. Fuck bowser. Edit: Somehow I forgot to mention tough guy. As if Bowser didn't have enough fucking super armor, (down tilt, forward smash, down smash, forward tilt and up smash all have armor) Nintendo decided fuck it, give this fatass free super armor for literally no reason. Oh you had a multihit attack? Yeah get punished for hitting your attack because he'll just power through and stomp on your face.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, you're so fucking cool for mashing your two projectiles and nair. Oh my goodness did you see that? He did the two hits of crown into literally any aerial, so hype, oh my god. Fuck off, spoon fed easy ass combos aren't cool and your character is literally braindead as fuck. Also, why is the windbox in his fucking gun so big? kirby's is literallly the size of an atom but this overweight fat fuck can suck into his gun from halfway across the stage. QP King K Rool's think they're so special and quirky it's almost to the level of Mario players. And shut up about him not getting buffed online. He literally gets buffed by so much because of fucking easy he is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ridley just clicks well with me. I love how he moves around and you can do some really cool things with his three jumps and skewer. I feel like you have a lot of control over his movement and even though it may be hard to approach, when you get in it's loads of fun. Ridley gets rewarded a lot by reads, so ti's a very fun experience playing him and satisfying as well. Edit: For buffs, there are two main things I want fixed. Space Pirate Rush doesn't kill too well and is way too laggy, and buff his weight so that it's more accurate to his body.</TEXT>

Sometimes in order to have spare time, they'll procrastinate on assignments which makes them feel guilty in return. You shouldn't have to feel guilty for having free time, and it's also the reason why most parents think it's normal for kids to not have any free time on school days. My mother thought this and disliked when I played games or did anything I wanted to in my free time. She would say that other kids in my school didn't play games during school days and that I should stop. It always irked me when I was younger because I only played when I had finished everything I needed to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not saying his addition was unjustified. In fact, I think it was incredibly justified. I was completely hyped when he was revealed since I really, really wanted him to be in smash since brawl. And I do agree-my comparison was a bit unfair. However, I don't think people don't talk about him because he's not good. There's plenty of characters worse than ridley who are talked about more than him. my point was that even Ridley, who is miles more relevant than Waluigi and much more deserving of a spot, was forgotten about a month into the game's release. What would happen to Waluigi, an infinitely. blander pick?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup. Ultimate did pretty good with character balancing but failed horribly with the skill cap and game mechanics. Spotdodge canceling, EZ bake kill confirms, some really stupid character specific mechanics, bury moves, etc. Of course, it still takes a lot of skill to actually get good at the game and play competitively, but it's really fucked up how some players with a tenth of the skill can come even or even beat a way more skilled player. And of course, ultimate's dogshit online doubles the effect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your neutral was okay, but you weren't capitalizing on landing hits, like the d tilt at the start. You get more reckless with arsene, and start fishing for smashes which is not a good thing. You got some nice reads though. You also have a bit of a habit of spotdodging after a whiffed punish, so sort that out. Your biggest problem is missing punishes, many times when you could have taken the stock. Mix up your options more, since your ledge options were kind of repetitive. Space your back airs more, and try to mix up your approaches. You only grabbed once the entire match, which is bad since the robin likes to shield.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The biggest issue with the patch was that they completely ignored several characters that needed nerfing as well as characters crying for buffs. They did buff lucario, jr and simon, which is a step in the right direction but the buffs aren't too much anyway. They also needlessly buffed characters that would have been just fine without the buffs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Three reasons: I love the Metroid franchise, especially fusion and zero mission, but Samus just wasn't main material, so I tried out ridley. This brings me to reason two, which is I love his playstyle. He's got surprisingly good mobility, good combos, and really good advantage, so when you play him in advantage he feels invincible. He's also really hype and can do some cool things with skewer and wing blitz. The third reason is skewer. That move makes up 30% of the reason why I play Ridley.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've been trying out plant lately as an experiment, and I've discovered that he's very fun. However, he needs some buffs to his tilts, maybe make his nair safe on shield, and possibly remove some intangibility frames from his up smash in trade for more range. Of course, I don't play plant that much so I could very well be spouting nonsense, but what do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I'm not a fan of when the main thing about a character is their singular gimmick. They should balance them out instead of just buffing their singular gimmick, making them unfun to play against. In my opinion, it's bad game design to have almost 50% of a character revolve around one move or mechanic, like K Rool's armor and crown, lucario's aura, little mac's ground game, etc. I'm all for balancing characters so that they don't have to rely on their win button to take games</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Literally the most anti-fun character in the entire game. All she does is forward smash and nair. The devs really suck at designing characters if the entire point of the character is to play a single-player game. Her stupid, whiny voice lines really make my blood boil. Stop fucking yelling as if you're accomplishing anything and just play the game you degenerate noodle-limbed piece of shit. Her range is actual bullshit and if you've got slow airspeed or a linear recovery you're fucked. This character is so braindead that you can win by LITERALLY using two moves. If Min Min existed in real life I would make it my personal mission to rip her arms off, shove the yellow ball thingy in her mouth, shove the other two up the ass and use the arms to fucking slingshot her into the stratosphere. Bravo dev team, you've created another annoying, campy character. I wish I could book a plane ticket to Japan, visit the dev team quarters and slap them upside the head with a literal bowl of noodles for designing such a shitty character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dwead every time I close my eyes. Someone had bwought theiw new gaming laptop to class. The Fowklift he used to bring it was still wunning idle at the back. I stawted sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already weinforced his desk with steel suppowt beams and was in the pwocess of finding an outlet for a powew cable thickew than Amy Schumew's thigh. I stawt shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alwight and that there's nothing to wowwy about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Teaws are wunning down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher stawts the lecture, and the student tuwns his laptop on. The colowed lights on his WGB Backlit keyboard flawe to life like a nucleaw flash, and a deep humming fills my eaws and shakes my vewy soul. The entire city powew gwid goes dawk. The classwoom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my wowld has gone from vibwant life, to a dawk, eawth shattering void whewe my body is getting town apawt by the 150mph gale fowce winds and the 500 decibel gwoan of the cooling fans. As my body finally suwwenders, I weep, as my school and my city go undew.</TEXT>
