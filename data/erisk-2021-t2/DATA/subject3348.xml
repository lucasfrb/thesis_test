    <DATE>2019-01-09 17:26:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wonder how? will it be through steam friends? because that way they will have to take steam and bethesda legal permission and stuff, or will it be through their own website or client? with new accounts.  #8203; :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any way to verify integrity of game cache without steam? (Skyrim)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-23 16:03:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ran into a problem after I reinstalled my windows, Skyrim was having missing meshes icon everywhere and huge chunks of lands were missing, I used their form ID and with tes5edit traced them back to....skyrim.esm. If it was a mod I could have the files and reinstall but the only way I can fix my corrupted skyrim.esm easily is through steam verification, which dosent work with pirated skyrim... Appreciate any help, thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What actually happened in the new ballistics update?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-23 19:16:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am yet to get a grasp of what happened in the recent ballistic change, the only thing I understood is some tanks penetration got changed, some got increased, mostly Americans and French, some got decreased, mostly Russians and Germans. By that logic I am assuming Germany and Russia are nerfed and America, France or whoever got more pen gare buffed, but to my surprise, I see even more Russian T3485s even after they got nerfed (In my eyes) So what actually happened in the update, is the only thing I should care about is the new penetrations or is there something else going on too?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best lucid dreaming app?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-14 17:23:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I am a beginner in this lucid dreaming business, started about an year ago. So far I've had only 4-5 lucid dreams and all of them were from triggering reality check. The last 2-3 dreams happened because I set my old phone (Galaxy note 4) up for alarms about 10 times a day so I had an habit of reality checking, I got a new phone few months ago (Xiaomi note 5) and used an app called awoken but it doesn't seem to give any notifications even if I set it to autostart, is there any other apps that can help me regain the habit of lucid dreams? Preferably by reality checks. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-22 11:15:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen this topic many times before and im gonna ask it again, is there any mod that limits AI division? you are minding your own buisness until 1945 and even Afghanistan has 80 divisions. It wreaks havoc on anyones processor and makes the game a unstable laggy clusterfuck. I have tried almost all the mods i could find related to this issue but not a single one actually limited the Ai division spam.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Incase you needed a reason to puppet instead of annexing.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-23 17:11:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you don't annex everything you see, do you even HOI4 bro?  #8203; But seriously, with every update HOI4 is getting bigger and harder to micromanage all the features, they tend to expand if you have big territories, having a puppet not only helps deal with these governance shit but also gives you the benefits of slightly improved AI patches over the years. But the biggest reason you would want to puppet is the NAVY. If you annex any country, poof, their navy is gone, manpower little to none. But if you puppet, their entire hard earned navy now works for you. For example, as Germany i had little to no Navy, I didn't even deploy it in the outbreak of war. After I Blitzkrieged France I immidiately established Vichy France, so as the French fleet and British fleet was chicken fighting near the Gibraltar, I safely transported my army group into England through the English channel, thus finishing WW2. Also puppeting United Kingdom is the best thing you can do because you can keep the biggest Navy in the world you won't have to worry about building you own navy ever again. Now even against USA I don't do shit with my weak navy because France and England are fighting them. Even if you give your puppet just 1 province, they will keep their navy.  #8203; Hope this helps any new player :)</TEXT>

But I can only fly 1 plane called Su25 :o Where did the other planes go? I can see very few planes in the bottom as individual DLCs. I thought the game was f2p? How do I acquire the other planes that I saw in youtube gameplays?  #8203; I hope to play this game more in the future, thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-03 18:05:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello This is not my 1st playthrough of Dawnguard(spoilers), I played it a year ago with no problem whatsoever. So now I'm trying to play it again and after A New Order Isran says Serana is here to see me but I go to the torture chamber and she is not there. I've googled a bit and seems there are hundreds of threads about it. Their solution was waiting ingame hours, loading a previous save etc, not managing Serana with AFT/UFO, none worked. I even used the console command to setstage the quest, they validate but Serana does not spawn to begin quest (also tried getting her there manually, she walks off). I'm sure it's an old and known bug but I just can't seem to find an answer for it :( Here is my load order if needed, but I don't think it affected the quest. The only mod that I think has anything to do with Serana is "Seranaholic" Also, the 1st time I played it I had the same mods, the only addition was a newer ENB and "build your own noble house" and that's it.  #8203;

They were standing and saying something in broken Bangla and was begging for money to whoever was infront of them. Most people in the mosque assumed they were Rohingyas but none of us were sure how to handle the situation. Should we call the police or let them be? This was on AC Masjid, Siddheshwari outer circular road, Dhaka. Edit: if someone related to the police department sees this please notify your superiors about the address I provided</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Couldn't initiate reality check because hands were blocked in real life?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-25 15:01:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so I always initiate a lucid dream by pinching my nose and trying to breath (don't know any other way) My dream was: Yesterday noon I was taking a nap, and in the nap I was dreaming traveling on a long road on what seemed to be a bus without roof and a truck convoy. Then the dropped dropped me infront of a crossroad, across the crossroad there was this huge 11th century Islamic architecture. I entered it and found a long hall, at the end of the hall, there was a 11th century muslim chemist sitting (who I was reading about when doing some chemistry research the previous day.) He was constantly saying "Guard of son, guard of son".Wtf does that mean? Then I found a pond inside the hall, yes, a pond. At the edge of the pond, there were some crabs from the video game Skyrim, sitting... I went near them and one of them jumped on me, I was scared shitless, and it was only then my dumbass decided "hey, this might not be the real world after all!" and I tried to do a reality check, but, my hands were feeling tied, I couldn't pinch my nose. Then I remembered my hands are in my pocket irl. So I tried to shift a little to real life and move them thinking I can go back to the dream, but I couldn't come back to the dream, I woke up after I freed my hands.. How is this even possible? As far as I know, in a dream you can move your body even if it's not being moved in real life.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-13 13:14:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is this not unbalanced? I've been playing for weeks but I can't unlock a simple cavalry or spear division because each of them requires 7500 honor on their own and many more perquisites draining all my honor I saved up to buy them. I get like 80 honor on average in field battles and siege battles sometimes yield 120+ honor but they take 10 minutes to find a match. The only reason I installed the game was to drive some Ottoman horse archers or Teutonic spearmen but I'm honestly thinking about quitting because of this unbalanced honor grind.</TEXT>

Much has happened since the Roswell incident of 1947. The gamers have inflicted upon the Air Force great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our anime offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our AAA titles and manga have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory! I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory! Good luck!

    <TEXT>Chads, Kyles, and Naruto runners of the Area 51 Expeditionary Force! You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and gamers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the government war machine, the elimination of American tyranny over the oppressed aliens of the west, and security for ourselves in a free world. Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is will trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely. But this is the year 2019! Much has happened since the Roswell incident of 1947. The gamers have inflicted upon the Air Force great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our anime offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our AAA titles and manga have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory! I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory! Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God and anime upon this great and noble undertaking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People on this sub can be very unpatient sometimes. Anyways, I really have never heard Saladin being the aggresior before and I've read a lot about Muslim generals. As for the selling Christian slaves part. He did it in response to crusader Reynald not returning some Muslim pilgrims he kept as slaves in his fort, so, as a strong and tactical response, he sold some seized a Christian merchant group and sold them. And talking about European lands, it wasn't considered European until you have crossed Anatolia. Middle east, Persia, Central asia, southern Russia etc were just known as "Muslim lands" near that period. Only places Saladin operated was from east Anatolia to the Levant. Which were perfectly acknowledged Muslim lands and middle east/central asian lands. Saladin was a chivlaric Muslim leader who, in his life, followed every principles of the Quran. That much I can assure you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, in a collectivist sense. If you look at history (both during or before Islamic rule you mentioned) Bengalis have been the biggest and if not, the most significant portion of this subcontinent ever since their migration from Persia to here compared to other ethnic groups and their various migrations from Persia, Africa, Polynesia. Of course all ethnic groups of India combined will outweight the lone Bengal ethnicity but it's true. Source can be whatever you want, wikipedia, history books, biology books or even your own tours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one. But our migration routes start from farmers from fertile crescent or neolithic Iranian steppes and tibeto-Burman migration, Biggest chunk of our DNA goes to neolithic Persian farmers, followed up by South Indian Dravidian and Tibeto-burmans.

Thats it, theres our history which goes even further back, if you want to go even further, the entire fucking world started from Africa. Indians are insecure because they don't really have a unified ethnicity, while we have and it's the biggest one of this subcontinent.

    <TEXT>General Kalid ibn al-Walid wanted to die as a martyr in the field of battle, and was apparently disappointed when he knew that he would die in bed. Khalid expressed the pain of this sadness through one last, anguished sentence:  gt;I've fought in so many battles seeking martyrdom that there is no spot in my body left without a scar or a wound made by a spear or sword. And yet here I am, dying on my bed like an old camel. May the eyes of the cowards never rest. #8212; #8201;Khalid bin Al-Walid Upon seeing his sorrow, the friend of Khalid told him:  gt;You must understand, O Khalid, that when the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad), on whom be the blessings of Allah and peace, named you *Sword of Allah*, he predetermined that you would not fall in battle. If you had been killed by an unbeliever it would have meant that Allah's sword had been broken by an enemy of Allah; and that could never be. #8212; #8201;Khalid's old friend</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Still that would be generalization to put the entire sub in feminazi category. As for downvoting Quranic views, we made a generation of liberals thanks to bad parenting and wrong initialization, so that is to be expected of most people these days. Just look at r/islam for example, I've seen many posts that are a bit *too* far left for my liking. But it's still a good sub. As for rejecting hadith, as we know, there are many forged hadiths made for political and social exploits ever since the death of the prophet, this is specially too common after the makings of social media, unfortunately, we are so blind to tell the difference between authentic and forged hadith because for the past 100 years and the forming of new Muslims countries, not a single one of them dedicates enough resources to protect hadiths and history and prevent exploits. Now this is probably very much going off topic since I didn't review the link you gave. Anyways, I think the vocal minority does not speak for the silent majority. Specially if a subs moderation team is purely far left/right leaning. We are all brothers and sisters who definitely needs to know more and Allah knows best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What a terrible view. If you are that daft let me explain it to you, I protested because of why did the author had to specify religion as if only Hindu students are being targeted? BCL does not care about religion and they will beat/kill anyone that opposes their corruption. The death of a Muslim student is a shining example of that. I'm such a goon that infact I might be killed by my neighboring MP's BCL son if he saw my comments.</TEXT>

As Skyrim combat, graphics and other mechanics felt very medicore to me. Especially the graphics but I used very good ENBs from Nexus to make it look amazing and was wondering if I can use ENBs with ESO also? Or is it's graphics upto standard from the getgo? Then again it's Standard Edition is going very cheap and seems like a huge game with just as much lore as Skyrim. I was hoping someone could confirm?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After January 3, 2020. the day General Qasem Soleimani got assasinated by US forces, there has been a sudden spark on social medias like Facebook, Reddit about "division" between the Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. It's almost suspicious how this came to the spotlight just after January 3, after the almost war like situation between US and Iran escalated even further. Your thoughts on this? Could this have been sparked by a third party as this current atmosphere is perfect staging ground for an all out war and the Muslim Ummah needs to be more united than ever? As we probably know, there are a LOT of groups who has a problem if the Ummah unites at a time like this.  #8203; edit: January, not December</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Social democracy definitely doesn't align "completely" with Islam, which is literally the path to God. You can never fit Islam into a single group of political ideology, which is factual. But in my opinion it does contain the best "pros" of all of the existing man made ideologies.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If a believer goes to hell because of too many sin, does he have to stay there permanently or can re-enter paradise after completing "sentence"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-14 18:51:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Peace be upon you, brothers and sisters. So we all know when a atheist goes to hell he has to stay there permanently. But I am unsure of the concept that when a believer goes to hell for committing more sins than good deeds, does he have to stay there permanently too after he has paid for his crimes or can he enter paradise after he has suffered enough. As far as I can remember it's the latter but I want to clear this misconception and I can't make the time to revisit this topic so I'm asking you brothers and sisters :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>? Boy you sure were lying when you said "Muslims are cool" But anyways, to elaborate on that, I was talking about why that man and other refugees like him look upto terrorists and go to strip clubs, the freedom in muslim countries usually means sovereignty or "ummah" and since they lost just that, particularly with defeat in the Great war, while terrorism, separatism got curbed in Germany with Hitler like dictators, the Middle east never had such a curbing let alone stop ummah from falling apart, So with newborn nations limiting this "ummah", they will look upto many forms of terrorists, ethnic separatists, jihadists and anything with a structure in the hopes for it to restore their sovereignty. But of course that's not what these groups have in mind and since we Muslims are mostly illiterate, we keep supporting and mourning groups without even knowing them. As for strip clubs, well, the war in Syria has been shifting for years and most of these refugees that visit strip clubs have their wife and family either dislocated or killed. So coping with these in bars, strip club is probably what has become of that. So yeah, "Yea losing a war and getting carved up to different new nations does that to people."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Physical objects in my lucid dreams doesn't feel real anymore.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-14 13:50:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Whenever I touch literally anything, be it houses or humans. It feels like rubber. When I initially started lucid dreaming 2 years ago touchable objects felt so real. I remember I captured a fox in a LD once and it's furs felt more real than our household cat that goes missing for 3 days straight to have an orgy with street cats. Last night, I spawned a fox in my dream to test and it felt like I was touching the void.. Like, liquid rubber with a heavy air inbetween. There was a friend of mine in that dream too, I grabbed his cheeks ( Face cheeks, Jesus) with both my hands and started pushing them together as hard as I could but it felt like hes face was made out of dusty rubber. This "rubber" ish feeling goes for literally everything in my dream now. And the more i think about it the more it intensifies, I think. Nowadays I generally feel my lucidity is "weaker". I can stay lucid for a long time but have not much power or physical effect whatsoever. Does this happen to anyone else? Can I fix it? My older lucid dreams were much more physically reallike, actually, even more real than actual life itself. Don't know how to go back to it now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By that i mean you take the hadiths from a credible source instead of the internet. Say for example you take 1 hadith as sunnah, follow it but later find out it's chain of narration was weak or reputable scholars discredited the narrator. Welp, that would be time and energy wasted following a forged hadith which would have no benefit or considered Sunnah in the end.. Still, if you have a good overview of the Quran and partial knowledge of the narrators you should have no problem finding credible sources on the internet. It's just that I trust books more than webpages</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While you are partially right. Islam does not have a dress code. It does have a few requirement. One of those is actually the covering of head. Of course, Hijab in no way guarantees piety. Some just wear it to cover up their vulgar deeds and inappropriate character. While there are sisters who are modest, non-vulgar but never considered covering the head, out of shame or judgement by others. (Allah is just, so we both know, even with their flaws, who is better of the two). So the "why" here is because it is part of the requirements, as mentioned in the Quran. So if you see someone saying the Arabic style of hijab is the only code of dress, and, for example, the Pakistani/Bangladeshi "Orna" isn't (Which easily fulfils the requirement of covering the head and bringing the rest over the bosom) Then these Muslims are not preaching Islam, rather, they are preaching their Arab culture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most scholar agree it's talking about the veil that christian/jewish/pagan women on that time used to wear but let it flow behind their back. In this verse, God says to bring that veil infront of their bosom. Which, if done, looks like something like the regular hijab. Some scholars interpret it as talking about covering bosom only with the christian/jewish veil as a reference., also in a pretty authentic hadith, the prophet indicated that hair should be veiled. So just to be one the safe side, it has always been interpreted hijab contains head covering. Oh and hijab actually means any type of barrier. A door is a hijab ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Then why would you get caught or commit the act publicly even though God has forbidden it? Someone kills you or not, Allah is just and he will punish you for promising punishment. All-forgiving exists only upto the day of judgement, so good luck in hell. At the same time, Allah is also called *Al-Mummet*, the one who gives death. Since the punishment is death, Does sound like *Al-Mumeet* to me. So take that pansy bullshit somewhere else.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-23 23:31:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>My monitor got hit by a house while I was swinging it to move the mousepad. Then when I started the PC it had these transparent yet oily kinda rainbow looking dead or stuck pixels on it. Here are some pictures: [Scientists detect a new virus](https://i.imgur.com/KMQJyvx.jpg), [First case confirmed](https://i.imgur.com/qIDa7VW.jpg) Then I tried some fix from the internet like [JScreenFix](https://www.jscreenfix.com/fix.html) for 10 minutes and pushing the pixels with a cloth firmly but oh God oh fuck it started spreading even faster: [Now it looks like a Star Destroyer](https://i.imgur.com/0HLGD3r.jpg). I really needed this monitor to run until January when I can buy a 1440p 60hz one but at this rate my monitor will look cleanly sawed in half by the time I'm done. Is there anything I can do to save it without spending $$$ on it? I don't want to since it's an old Samsung 21 inch LED office monitor that came with my PC in 2015. Thanks and God bless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Be careful with that title brother as not to say the Prophet said but narrated by XYZ that the Prophet said. Like, a similar [Hadith](https://sunnah.com/abudawud/34/20) in Sunan Abu Dawud, also narrated from Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik, excludes the Prophet mentioning musical instruments : Abu Amir or Abu Malik told me--I swear by Allah another oath that he did not believe me that he heard the Messenger of Allah ( #65018;) say: There will be among my community people who will make lawful (the use of) khazz and silk. Some of them will be transformed into apes and swine. Abu Dawud said: Twenty Companions of the Messenger of Allah ( #65018;) or more put on khazz. Anas and al-Bara' b. 'Azib were among them. **Grade**: #160;**Sahih** (Al-Albani) **Reference** #160;: #160;Sunan Abi Dawud 4039 In-book. reference #160;: #160;Book 34, Hadith 20 English translation #160;: #160;Book 33, Hadith 4028  #8203; Nafi' said: Ibn Umar heard a pipe, put his fingers in his ears and went away from the road. He said to me: Are you hearing anything? I said: No. He said: He then took his fingers out of his ears and said: I was with the Prophet ( #65018;), and he heard like this and he did like this. (Hadith 4924) After narrating this hadith Imam Abu Dawood has said that it is a Munkar (rejected) Hadith.  #8203; I do not need to tell you how well reputed Abu Dawud is for his accuracy. Do not think I'm personally judging haram/halal status of music, that is for the scholars to debate on, I have no such qualification of that. But I just thought I'll add some leverage as the title makes it sound like it's absolute and does not mention "narrated by XYZ" first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No point downvoting me. I'm saying this because on the same video there's : "Did you make any attempt to clarify this with the people involved before posting it to YouTube? Although I cannot speak for Mohammed al Shareef, the following is the response I recieved directly from Mufti Menk. Truth about Mufti Menk Interrogation. Recently an edited sound clip was posted on social media by mischief makers trying to portray Mufti Menk as being supportive of gays and of the shaking of hands between genders. The clip was edited out of a 48 minute interrogation by the Danish. The unedited FULL version which was intentionally cut, starts with speaking of rules and regulations in Islam. Towards the end it went onto the discussion of Denmark and whether or not its people are free to choose their preferences in their own lives. This was all cut off the circulated version. When asked to say YES or NO if he believed they (ordinary people in Denmark) can be gay, he didn't reply with a yes or no. He in fact explained by saying that they (the people spoken about) can choose to do what they wish. They can choose to be whatever they want. They're free to choose their religion and preferences. He also said they can choose to be Muslim too if they feel so, in which case they would have chosen through their secular freedom to restrict themselves in certain matters based on their religion. This was also edited out. At no point did he say that Muslims can be gay or that Islam says it's ok to be gay or to shake the hands of the opposite gender. He had also clarified that from a religious ruling perspective homosexual acts are disallowed in Islam and that shaking the hands of the opposite sex is detested. This too was edited. The circulated version of a few minutes was made to appear as though he is pro gay or pro cross gender hand shaking. Please be careful of what you hear or see on social media. Most of it is altered or doctored to control the minds and perceptions of the masses. We believe there is a strong drive to discredit our religious leaders so that we are left with no one trustworthy enough to guide us. Be aware. Islam and it's regulations will remain upto the end if time. Alhamdulillah" Copied from the same video.</TEXT>

They wrote 3 year warranty in the bill but didn't stamp or write 3 year on the actual warranty card that comes inside the monitor box. Wondering if I got scammed or something. Figured I should try to register the product digitally at this point because I hear you can get warranty if you register within 30 day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I only now realize after coming to this sub how I took what I have for granted, God forgive.  #8203; I recently bought a cheap Gigabyte G32QC for 369$, even the retailers were hesitating to test it and said they will only replace it if I bring it in the next 1 day, otherwise they won't take any liability for dead/stuck pixels and only will service it for 3 years warranty they gave (mind you, they didn't stamp the actual gigabyte warranty card). Well, it's been a few weeks, I check every corner of the monitor like my life depends on it, still no trace of dead or stuck pixel for now :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I register a G32QC monitor for warranty?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-26 19:12:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey I originally posted it on r/gigabyte but no one answered. So I was wondering if I could do that, recently purchased the monitor from a retailer. They wrote 3 year warranty in the bill but didn't stamp or write 3 year on the actual warranty card that comes inside the monitor box. Wondering if I got scammed or something. Figured I should try to register the product digitally at this point because I hear you can get warranty if you register within 30 day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quran only talks about evil vocals, not music in itself. As for rest of music there are contradictory hadiths, some where prophet allowed it while his companions were against it, some where prophet called it unlawful. Islamic music and musical therapy was always present in the Muslim world, had there been a definitive answer, this wouldn't be possible as the people those days were a lot more Islamic than us. The musical industry of today is definitely vulgar and unlawful but that doesn't mean music of the old, nasheeds, marches are haram. It's like saying food is haram because pork is food for some people. Only Allah knows best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, dare I say if literally *any* nowdays music fits the criteria of permissibility. Honestly, the only few artists that fit the criteria are local nasheed singers, small scale non vulgar singers, international singers like Sami Yusuf, Quran recitators, religious poets, military marches etc. Even then, they only practice old Islamic age or classical period of melodies and rythym. Honestly, we have more pressing matters than music..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably doesn't contribute to the topic but I'd like to add that France in the past has staged assassinations like this to get war justification against Muslim countries, (Or any other countries for that matter, look at the death sentence of a French model accused of spying for the German reich, just to cover up French military defeats) It was only the Ottoman caliphate declaring war on them once instead that France decided to admit to those assassination. So maybe it could be similar case here.. After all, all the attacker hid was a knife while the cut made on the victim was a single clean one requiring a blade of much, much greater length.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not a bad point actually. Gaddafi was against letting Muslims go to Europe and keep their intellects inside Arab lands. But look what that got him, drone strikes and a fully US funded overthrow. Hell, he even stood in the way to African migration to Europe as a sign of goodwill for the people of scripture.</TEXT>
