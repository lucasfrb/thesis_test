    <TEXT>Most of the time it #8217;s due to people dropping coins and other small objects into the escalators. Once that happens safety sensors get triggered and the escalator comes to a halt. Maintenance has to then be called up to remove what ever has fallen in. I believe this this most common reason for escalators being out of action.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a bowler you have their economy rate. The economy rate is the average number of runs that they give per over. The lower the economy rate, the better the bowler. A batsmen has a batting average. For example a batting average of 45 in a ODI (one day innings) means they on average score 45 an ODI.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Toy train that runs when it is switched off</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-08 10:24:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>This afternoon I playing around with a small toy train and I noticed the following. For some context, the train I used was powered by 2 AAA batteries and has a single on/off switch. Earlier that evening I found some depleted AA batteries which I inserted into a battery pack. They were about 8, all connected in series. I decided to connect this battery pack to the train along with the 2 AAA's already inside the train. As expected the motor spun up quicker, however when I switched the train to the 'off' position it would not stop, it just kept going. I thought the switch may have been faulty, so I disconnected the external battery pack and ran the train again. This time it switched off as expected. Can someone explain this phenomenon for me? https://m.imgur.com/a/nYCOZy3 That picture shows the connections I have made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Challenger was lost first when the O ring seal between the sections of the Solid Rocket Booster was compromised. It caused a burn through to occur which subsequently caused an aerodynamic break up of Challenger. Columbia broke-up on re-entry because during the launch, a piece of insulating/aerodynamic foam broke off and fractured a Reinforced Carbon Carbon panel. The RCC panels were located on the regions of peak heating, so if they were compromised very little can be done. Sadly during re-entry Columbia #8217;s wing structure failed from heating and she too failed due to aerodynamic loads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NASA did have some significant issues with their management structure. They was a significant divide between management and the  #8216;lower #8217; level missions personnel. Often times blame is placed on the management because they had final say but I believe the blame needs to lie with the entire organisation as a whole. Days prior to the launch, mission specialists spoke with NASA management and informed them of the risks with launching on a cold morning. They did so using a single key note presentation where on one slide, surrounded by technical jargon was the statement that said that there was a high risk of failure of the o ring if the launch was conducted. Management either ignored this, or they simply didn #8217;t comprehend the magnitude of the dangers in play. Sadly it was a painful way to learn this message but it had to get to them somehow.</TEXT>

I understand that there are general steps that a surgeon would follow during a surgery, but could it be made as methodical as say an engine overhaul. Team A does half of the work and at the end if the shift team B takes over. Such a hand over is made possible because every step is defined and acts as sort of a checkpoint.

We need our Government to actually lead and lead businesses away from practices that are harming our planet.

We need them to drive the point that our dependence on fossil fuels has to end within a decade and to transfer all our power generation to renewables.

    <TEXT>A common misconception is that the total life cycle emissions released by EVs is higher than regular ICEV. This is entirely untrue. At the present state of technology, it is true that we release more emissions when we produce an EV than an ICEV. However, when it comes to day to day driving EVs are so efficient that they make up for all the extra emissions it produced during production. In the end, the total emissions released by an EV is vastly less than a ICEV. This gets better when our grid utilises more renewables. Also EVs are better for our health as the emissive exhaust gases are linked to variety of lung and heart problems. Source: I am a Mech. E undergrad and we study these systems</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What OP meant was that Hydrogen fueled cars would generate the same economic model that we have right now with fuels. Just as we go to a Fuel station to refuel our cars, a hydrogen fueled industry would require us to go to refueling stations to pump our vehicles with hydrogen. Basically we maintain the same process where we pay a seller to give us fuel. A Battery Electric Vehicle on the other hand gives the user the control to recharge their vehicle from any source that they choose. For instance, if their household generates enough power via renewables they don't have to pay anyone else to charge their vehicle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Battery electric vehicles are designed from the begining with the battery pack itself as the floor/chassis. Generally a pressurised hydrogen tank can be stored about where a standard fuel tank is, but the two designs together are not compatible. Also the ineffiencies for hydrogen stem from quiet a few processes. Hydrogen itself is produced through steam reformation which requires oil and is tremendously inefficient. The alternative method is to use electrolysis, but that in itself is very energy intensive. After the hydrogen is produced, it needs to compressed and stored which is another energy intensive process. Next up is transport for the hydrogen to refuelling locations, again with energy going to transport. Finally, this hydrogen is stored in vessels with their leakage losses, and then the fuel cell itself has its own inefficiencies. All these processes occur before the power actually reaches the motor. Batteries on the other hand suffer from very little 'energy leakage' and directly transfer energy to the motors. This process has very little transfering locations where energy is lost which is why BEV are so efficient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For most EVs, the battery itself outlasts the drive train. My wording wasn #8217;t clear but I meant that battery structure is part of the vehicle chassis. It is a single block that can be replaced if need be. Yes, batteries do discharge, however, it isn #8217;t as significant as you might believe. Furthermore, the cost of driving an EV is less than driving a Hydrogen fuel vehicle because energy production is cheaper. Also, want to add that all my points are valid and do hold because the entire hydrogen production and storage infrastructure is riddled with serious inefficiencies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Launch vehicles during and prior to launch sends back a multitude of data streams. Along with these data stream, high speed footage is captured of the vehicle while it is on the pad and in the earlier stages of flight. In the case of Challenger, the tell tale signs of a burn through were see by pad cameras when a stream of black smoke emanated from near a SRB O ring. For Columbia, a burn up on re-entry points heavily in the direction of a failure in the thermal protection system so the TPS was assessed. Furthermore, launch footage shows the piece of foam actually strike the leading edge of Columbia. In general these investigation follow all the possible leads until they can conclude one after another that they did not contribute the accident.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Australia and NZ previously received Pringles directly from the US. Now Australia/NZ gets Pringles from a fairly new location in Malaysia, with the most likely reason being lower transportation costs. The can in particular from Malaysia are smaller in diameter than the typical cans due to the machinery on hand. Consequently, some people have problems actually reaching into the can because of the smaller mouth. Finally, it is reported that the Malaysian made Pringles lack the same flavour and taste of the US ones. I guess this Coles attempt at telling/warning customers of the minor differences that they should expect from the pringles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Prior to using the RD-181, Antares used two Aerojet AJ-26 engines. The AJ-26 engines were modified russian NK-33 engines, the engine type used on the highly successful N1 rocket. After the 2014 Antares launch failiure, Orbital Sciences (as the company was known at the time) sought to use RD-180's, the same type that is used on the current Atlas V. However, due to restriction imparted by United Launch Alliance (the company that launches the Atlas V) Orbital was not allowed to import RD-180's so they chose to use the RD-181s. The RD-181s provided the Antares with more thrust at launch so the vehicle as a whole is more capable than it was with the AJ-26s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Rutan Boomerang is definitely a great matchbox casting. Also, I wish if more of the Skybusters castings came with display stands like this aircraft. Skybusters aircrafts for the most part are fairly well done however the landing gear takes away from their appearance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the most part in the regions that weren't really impacted by fires, we are continuing our day to day lives as per usual. Yesterday for instance, we had a small fire(most likely arson) that got rather close to homes but it got extinguished within a matter of hours. This lead to many roads being shut down during rush hour as people we were heading home. So even if the fire doesn't impact us directly minor inconveniences like these cascade down and impacts wider parts of the population.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah their aircrafts bar the Max's are great aircrafts. The problem with Boeing in their spaceflight sector is their massive cost overruns while their competitors provide similar products at lower prices. Furthermore, Boeing appears to be plagued with quality control issues due to them cutting corners and this all stems back to bad leadership and work culture.</TEXT>

For some context, in Australia there are 3 Amazon Fulfillment centres, with one of those being in Perth, where I live. Would the Perth center be the origin of the package since it is the closest one to me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply! The item is already shipped and had I opted for a 'Parcel Point' delivery. Normally when I have FedEx delivering it to me the tracking info lists the origin and all the stop overs. In this instance, the tracking provided by Parcel Point isn't as comprehensive and it only shows whether the package is in transit or not. Guess I can learn of its origin once it comes to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks I might take my Passport along with me as well then! In my case I have to depend on the tracking provided entirely by Parcel Point and it is beyond awful. It just list the package as being in transit without even providing a rough location like a sorting depot. It is so vague it doesn't even tell you the origin of the package. Apparently for eBay, Parcel Point is their recommended method of package return so I guess many people will use that service.</TEXT>

One good example was the parcel hook, which for many including myself seemed completely unnecessary but he had shown many uses well beyond it's initial use case.

    <TEXT>That's very odd. Best bet is to get some plastic buffing compound and to give it a nice rub over. It probably won't fix the deep scratches you have on the side, nevertheless it will mask all the minor scratches. Recommend you get a small sleeve to keep your knife more protected.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-03 11:00:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since I got my Victorinox small tinker, I had the opportunity to use all the tools except the can opener. All the cans in my kitchen happened to have the pull tabs for opening so the can opener remained unused until today. Today at work I was tasked with removing the price stickers from dozens of various items. Since the stickers were freshly applied the adhesive had bonded tightly to the cardboard packaging making it next to impossible to remove without tearing half the sticker off. Turns out the blade on the can opener tool is the perfect angle and shape to wedge it under the surface of the sticker. Once the tool is shimmied left to right half the sticker is cleanly removed making very easy to remove the remaining part of the sticker. TLDR: wedge the can opener blade under a stick or piece of tape to cleanly remove it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe Samsung does not use the Qualcomm fast charge standard since they have their own proprietary one. Your phone needs a charger that is compatible with the Qualcomm standard and then you should get the fast charging capability. When you use the Samsung adapter your phone likely limits the charging rate to a level that is well below what your phone can handle. Please take this with a grain of salt but I believe this is the likely issue. On that adapter there should be number in volts (V) and a number for current level (A). Multiply the two together to get the power output. There is possibility the power output is 10W in which case it is well below what you need for fast charging.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recommend starting with mechanical pencils with a thicker lead as these are often more resilient to breaking. I started off using 0.7mm sized lead before moving onto a 0.5mm sized lead for day to day to work. To be honest they are both great lead sizes for day to day use. The first decent mechanical pencil I got was the *Staedtler mars micro* in 0.7mm (the pencil in the middle). Its very affordable and reliable and overall gets the job done. Once you get used to writing with a mechanical pencil you get a on how much pressure to apply and it becomes fairly easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's definitely better to use them than to just dispose of them. Hopefully once there empty you can find a place that recycles stationary. While on discussion of promotional pens, some promotional pen companies (Prodir is good example) actually produce some really high quality pens. If you get ones like these actually hold onto them and just refill them. It is very easy to find the refills for these as they use a standard refill size.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I might recommend the Parker Jotter XL because it is wider and longer than the standard Jotter. It uses a standard 'Parker' refill which is a standard refill size made by a tonne of manufactures so you have plenty of refills to choose from. You can find a lot of gel refills for these.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought it was worth while because pens are often disposed off with no consideration to how they would end up in a landfill. I think plain wooden pencils are a step in the right direction but try to aim to buy pencils that purely unpainted wood. Pencils that are painted are harder to break down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is a great idea! As others have suggested, if possible, aim to get a fountain pen that you refill with bottled ink. This is probably the most sustainable method as all you will have to dispose off in the end is a glass bottle. However, if you are like me and you do a lot of field work then it is possible that you writing surface is often wet from rain or sometime of oil. Because of the nature of fountain pen ink, it wouldn't write well or at all in these instance which is why I use ball point pen refills. Try to get a pen that is decently well built so you can keep re-using it!</TEXT>

According to eBay, the item got posted the 09/06/2020 and was set to arrive on the 17th. Another eBay order I made got shipped on the 11th and arrived Monday with a one day delay being due to me asking for a parcel redirect.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by leaving a fountain pen uncapped</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-24 14:53:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently I got into using fountain pens when I found an old Waterman Expert in a draw. I had begun to use it more frequently as I wanted to incorporate it into my daily use. After doing some writing I left the pen uncapped laying on the edge of a notebook. I didn't give a second thought to this because it was a habit of mine. When I returned, maybe an hour or so later the pen was no longer on the table. I found it on the floor and returned to writing. Immediately I noticed the smooth glide of the pen nib was replaced by a scratchy and jittery ink flow. The pen had landed on the floor nib first, completely deforming the writing point of the nib. Had I capped the pen it would never have rolled off the table and cost me $40 for a replacement nib. TL;DR: Left pen uncapped and it fell tip first. The tip is now badly deformed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The original Jotter looked suprisingly different without the arrow clip. Also, the threading on the newer Jotter's is wider and less defined than on the original models so it's one of only a few minor changes the Jotter has undergone.

There are plenty of spare parts for Victorinox multi-tools on eBay so you can get them really cheap. In my case I had been after some EDC scissors for a while and the swisscard scissors were perfect for the job. You can find a lot of folding EDC scissors out there but I trust Victorinox's quality. I am in the process of making a small sheath to hold the scissors because my current temporary one is made of just cardboard.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-21 14:47:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently found a brand new Victorinox Swisscard Classic for less than the half the retail price. Since Swisscards are generally priced very highly I decided to buy it. It should be delivered in a few days time but I am unsure whether to keep it or resell it. If you own a swisscard what do/don't like about it. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the feedback about the tool. It's great to see that the Swisscard can be used as a stand alone multitool because that was my intended purpose for it. Sometimes I like to travel with only my wallet and phone in the pocket so it's nice to have a multitool in the wallet. Also, I noticed all the tools are held in the case by some raised portions of the case. I would expect that with time these raised edges would grind down and the tools won't be held in as securely. Have you noticed anything like this yet? 4.5 mm does appear pretty thick though my wallet is very empty at the moment so I shouldn't have any issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Four engined jets are: \- more expensive to maintain \- more expensive to fly Airlines moved from hub to spoke model to a point to point model. A hub to spoke model needs large passenger planes to carry many passengers to a hub airport before they are routed to the destination by smaller planes. This was required in the early jet age as small/mid-sized aircraft did not have the range to fly between two distant destinations. Now midsized aircraft like the B787 and A350 can fly direct between destination airports without a stopover at a hub which is the point to point model.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of the sellers would provide the name of the particular model. Look up that model on Victorinox's website and see if there are any differences. If the Victorinox crest is not on the knife it's fake. When buying it online try looking for reputable sellers. This applies to both eBay and Amazon. The final giveaway should be the price. A knife that retails for $40 and is being sold for $10 should arouse some concerns unless of course, the knife is second hand. For me, my favourite tools apart from the knife are the scissors and Phillips screwdriver. I find these to be the ones I use most throughout the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I will probably get downvoted for this but I will say nonetheless. I think it is a trend I have noticed across certain subreddits where people qualify a tool (pen, knife, watch...) that is expensive as being the 'real deal'. It is great that you can afford something that is fairly expensive and that it is valuable to you but it does come off as being elitist. For some people that $10 or $15 dollar knife is all they can afford and makes them feel apart. A knife doesn't need to expensive for it to be real, it just needs to offer some value to you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-03 09:27:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I opted for a recent eBay (Australia) order to be picked up at a store (Woolworths) rather than having it delivered to my house. Last week Friday I got a tracking confirmation of the item as being delivered to the store but no confirmation of the item as being ready for pickup. I went to the store today and got told that there were no parcels under my name. Since then I have lodged a investigation with Australia Post in order to confirm that the parcel has indeed been delivered to the correct store. If everything is fine on Australia Posts end how do I deal with the store and how/when should I get eBay involved in this. Just want to add that my usual parcel pick up location is a local pharmacy and I have never had any issues with them. This was the first mix up.</TEXT>

The general law in my state is that you cannot carry a knife on you unless you have a legitimate reason such as for work, camping etc. I would normally carry a Small Tinker on me but because of the knife laws unless I am heading to and from work I cannot have it on hand. The scissors on the Swiss card and its other tools are Reasonably good at filling in incase I don't have my SAK. The blade is tiny but I think I could still get fined for having it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am using a Moto G6 Play and the minimum audio volume is way too high. It is at a point that I no longer use the phone without earphones because of how loud it is. Does anyone know of any solution to this? Worth pointing out that this is a very common issue and one that has existed for a long time with no solution on Motorola's end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, I am adjusting the volume slider and the minimum sound is too high. Right now I am using the shipping tape hardware solution to lower the volume. It's frustrating how such a long standing issue hasn't been resolved yet</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I am playing a YouTube video for instance, I place my thumb directly over the speaker to muffle the sound to a more reasonable level. On the lowest setting otherwise you can very easily hear it across the room. I have tried multiple 3rd party apps to try to reduce the minimum volume but nothing has worked so far. Here a post that talks about this issue: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-G6-Moto-G6-Plus-Moto-G6-Play/Re-Minimum-volume-is-way-too-loud/m-p/4172984?page=1#4172984</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I have that same issue with my device. I think it is a fairly widespread issue across Moto G6 and G6 Play devices. I had hoped that Motorola would implement a software fix for it but they haven't done anything so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the ink is special. While it is held within the ink refill under pressure, it behaves like a very rubbery viscous fluid, which stops the ink from leaking out. However, when you actually write with it, the ink becomes less viscous and has more or less the same property as a regular ball point ink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Op remove the grip section and re-insert the refill. Grip onto the tip of the refill and press the 'button' on the pen and see whether the refill does about 90 degree rotation and the refill should either rise or lower. Sometimes this happens when the mechanism is brand new and just needs to be worked in. The other thing I recommend is that you take the refill out and see whether the refill can slide smoothly back and forth through the tip. If it seems to snag on the tip then the tip might be slightly bent in. If there is a spring in the grip section then make sure refill is positioned well within it. Based on your picture is appears as if the collar in the pen isn't turning enough to lock out so your tip sticks out. As the other user suggested, just apply some pressure as you re-insert the refill and observe how much the refill rises/lowers when you press the button.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, they were allowed to recover the stages after their launches. Prior to this announcement the contracts had required SpaceX to use new F9 first stages rather than their fleet of previously flown stages. SpaceX is now allowed to fly certain government payloads aboard reused F9s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well as you would expect, rockets are mighty complex and a lot of systems and subsystems have to work immaculately for a successful flight. When SpaceX designed the Falcon 9 first stage, it was designed from the beginning to be reused. However, they had to prove that the damage the vehicle sustains each flight is minimal and does not pose a hazard for further flights. They carry out inspections each flight and as of late, the first stages have been able to fly more and more. These National Security payloads are very expensive to construct and their operators didn't want to lose a payload onboard a 'used' Falcon 9. So, they opted for only brand new stages for these flights contracts. However, SpaceX has flown these used stages very frequently with other payloads. This gave sufficient enough evidence to prove to the Government operators that these used F9s are just as safe as the new ones, hence the change in the launch contract.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the vehicle under goes flight loading cycles which haven't been examined in depth before. With each reflight SpaceX can observe the wear and tear the vehicle experiences and modify the vehicle accordingly. Most commerical customers who offered to fly on the first reflights were given discounts which made these early flights possible. The recon, gps operators don't really care about the cost as long as their payload gets to orbit safely.</TEXT>

Meanwhile, the other states like Western Australia and South Australia kept tight borders so once case numbers dropped down very quickly.

Flight suits are capable of being pressurised in the case of a depressurization which the blue jumpsuits are not capable off. The proper SpaceX flight suits have an umbilical that links the crew to their spacecraft and provides the suit pressurisation, communication, heating just to name a few.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everything is speculation at this point but apparently during the glass ceiling installation it was noted that frame appeared to have began to sag (deflected more than expected). This was noted at the very latest, last week. Questions were raised and more specialists (engineers) were called in however they had continued with the installation which unfortunately failed catastrophically today. One of the reasons likely being investigated is whether or not the structural beams were within the design tolerances. Once again this is all speculation and I am interested to see what the investigation reveals.</TEXT>
