    <TEXT>Notice letters can be really short because they shouldn't actually be used as the primary means of giving notice. Tell your NPs that you need to talk to them and explain that you're resigning, give reasons if appropriate and let them know when your last day will be. If you want to work out any transitional technicalities, this is a good time to bring it up. You can give them the letter as a summary or if you're worried they may later deny what was said in person, but many employees don't even bother with a notice letter at all (even in office jobs, let alone nannying). A sample notice letter can look like this: After three wonderful years with Janie, I #8217;ve made the difficult decision to move on, and March 31 will be my last day. I enjoyed seeing her mature and hope she grows up into a lovely young lady. I am committed to make the transition as smooth as possible. - ParlorPalm That's it! Just three sentences - because you'll say everything else in person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you think you could train to brush her hair better? Like the basics with long hair are to hold on to the top of the strand near your scalp. Then even if you tug on the bottom of the brush, you'll be tugging at the place you're holding, not the scalp. Also, brushing dry hair generally hurts less. Honestly, if she can't brush it herself after that, than she simply can't have that kind of hair. Either a hair dresser can do layers to reduce the volume of hair on her head while preserving the length - or it will just have to be cut shorter. That's going to have to be her parents' decision of course, but as a mom I'd just explain to her that she can't have long hair if she won't brush it. And follow through - cut off a few inches with home scissors the next time she refuses.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Obligatory protein question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-29 14:30:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Am I getting enough protein? I've heard a lot of vegan sources say that as long as you're getting enough calories on a whole food diet, it's impossible to not have enough protein BUT: Some background info: I've been vegetarian for a while. In September, I started transitioning towards veganism along with some other changes to my lifestyle (I changed jobs, so I have a lot more free time for sleeping, cooking and exercising). So I'm eating about 1800 kcal a day, burning about 2100 (a lot of runnning, no strength training). Went from 75 kg (slightly overweight for my height of 172 cm) to 65 kg (normal weight) and although I can't measure it, the mirror tells me that a lot of fat got replaced with lean muscle (my legs look awesome). Anyways, as I've gradually eliminated most dairy and eggs, I've found my protein intake to be around 35 grams a day. That comes from a lot of roasted veggies (green beans, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower... which are really not that calorie dense though), some beans (I should be eating more... but I just am not), walnuts and some soy milk. Most of my calories come from carbs - vegetables, fruits and whole grains, as well as my sweet tooth for cookies and soda. I googled how much protein I should be eating and sources say 0.8g - 1.2 per kilogram of body weight (so... 52 - 79 g) or 10-35% of calories (so 45 - 158 g). So what about the oft repeated claim that you can't get too little protein on a vegan diet? Well, it works with the claim that you only need 6% of your calories to come from protein. But can someone back that up? Because I haven't seen a single non-vegan source operate with that number and vegan sources aren't sourcing it with scientific studies. I mean, if I really do need to up my protein intake, it wouldn't be hard to do it. But it would mean to moving from beans 2-3 times a week to everyday, cooking with soy and it's just a bit annoying. So do I really need to? And if so, what are your favourite hassle-free sources :) ? Like if I wanted to get 50g with my beloved green beans, I'd need to eat 3 kilograms of them. And that's a high-protein veg!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're right. I think I was kind of hoping for a "oh, you're fine", but you're right. I'm just going to have to learn to cook with beans and pulses, because I didn't eat them as an omni. I think the issue is that I've basically replaced most of my animal products with veggies, which means that my meals are too low calories and I do reach for sweets as a snack since I get hungry. But as you said - pulses are easy - I just need to get used to them. Sorry if it seems like I'm working through really obvious stuff, I'm sure I'll figure it all out, but I guess I'm still mentally stuck in a meat-based mealplan just omitting the meat... and that's obviously not working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a really complicated question and would depend on the laws of the respective countries, as well as any agreements between them. Many countries aren't very open to adoptions by foreigners in the first place. And your home country may not recognise one or both of the adoptive parents as legal parents, leading to a myriad of issues. It's really impossible to answer without knowing the countries concerned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All good doctors are warm and friendly, because treating patients that way has been proven to lead to better outcomes. And even if he genuinely thinks you're an interesting person, it doesn't mean he's romantically into you. On the off chance that he were, it would be a huge violation of professional norms for him to act on it - I'm not familiar with the UK, but most medical associations/boards have ethics codes that are legally binding - dating a patient could lead to loss of licence to practice medicine. Don't fool yourself and don't treat him any different than you would a female GP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that sounds like an offer you can't refuse. As zahcncam said, do make sure you have an unconditional offer before you resign. I would also ask why the previous nanny didn't work out - that will give you some insight into how stable your position is. Congratulations and don't feel guilty for moving on - this is the best decision for you. I know that nannying is personal, but at the end of the day, it's an employment relationship where you're trading services for money. If the nanny parents got the opportunity to change jobs for a huge pay increase, they'd take it - and their employer wouldn't be 'devastated, hurt and betrayed'. It's just a normal part of working relationships. I would, however, say to the new family: "If it's possible, I'd like to give my current family 2-3 weeks notice as a professional courtesy, so I would start on [X]. Would that timeline work for you?"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you put on a bra?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I'm not joking \- I'm 24 and have realised I've been putting on a bra wrong my whole life. When I was 12 and had my first bra, my older sister taught me to wrap it around my waist, secure the hooks in front, spin it and pull it up. Went for a bra fitting yesterday, apparently, you're supposed to slip into the straps first and hook it behind you \- which has you get a better fit on which clasp to use. Ugh! And I just can't \- I am physically unable to secure the hooks if I don't see them. For sports bras \(which can't be hooked in front and spun because they have criss cross straps\) I've just been buying ones with a zip in the front. How do you put it on? Does hooking in the back become easier with practice? How do normal people put on bras with criss cross straps? So many questions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would be vary of them. Insurance is a binding contract, where the insurance company is obligated to pay out in predefined situations. If an insurance company rejects your claim, you have legal recourse. The insurance industry is extremely regulated and insurance companies are subject to strict solvency criteria (making sure the company has enough money to pay out claims). Health ministries are not the same as insurance. Smaller claims are not going to be an issue, but if you have a really expensive issue - think cancer - you have no guarantee they'll actually be willing to pay out or have sufficient funds to do so.

Over the past couple of years however, the Magistrate has been really pushing public transport hard to help with traffic pollution. The price of the annual pass went down significantly (and will become even cheaper for students from September) and in the fall of last year, they introduced this new scheme that forgives people half of the fine if they buy the annual pass. It's only an option though, paying the full fine is still possible (and makes sense for tourists).</TEXT>

If you can't afford that and have some EU health insurance, just show up at the Motol emergency room.

    <TEXT>Yes, you can buy it in advance in person. Generally, for international tickets the earlier you buy the cheaper it is, until like three days in advance when you just get the base price. The trains never sell out because Ceske Drahy is capable of selling more tickets than they have seats (therefore, be sure to get a seat reservation). I would disagree with Aan, Ceske Drahy uses different trains for international routes than for local ones, the train to Budapest is usually a nice Metropolitan, unless you get the one provided by Hungarian Railways. As for pricing, that really depends on whether you buy in advance or just turn up in the person (yeah, the irony of suggesting you just turn up in the same comment as whining about it being expensive is not lost on me).</TEXT>

I feel a great sense of achievement when improving a personal record, because it reflects my hard work and perseverance. A PR boosted solely by shoes isn't going to be that confidence boost. At the professional level, it's very much a different story. The increased speed they reference in the article is really incredible - marathon winners are often performing at their bodies limits', so they can't just get better by upping their weekly mileage (like you or me) - this shoe gives them speed that's otherwise unattainable. And that's actually an issue if we want the sport to be fair and equitable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most freelancers have a higher rate for short term gigs. Say you want to earn 200 bucks a day. If you have a client with a large project, you just charge them 25/h, easy. But it's probably a lot harder to do 8 one-hour jobs in one day - think about commuting to client sites (eg. this lady's home), having to coordinate times (what if two of your clients want a 9 am meeting) etc. So for example, a freelancer might charge 25/h to a big client, but 35/h to someone who just wants a small one-off job. Thing is, the woman has this all wrong. First of all, you can't have the rates be 5 and 10 dollars respectively - it's just far too low. Second, these terms are negotiated between the parties, not set unilaterally by the customer. Third - the lady's just insane!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adoption is a wonderful thing, but I'd be vary of suggesting it as a way to make parenting easier. Thing is, adoption is by definition preceded by trauma - at the very minimum, there's separation from the biological parents and then there's also the reason for separation. A toddler or school aged child with a history of trauma isn't some Anne of Green Gables fairytale. They've been through a lot and need a lot of support and informed parenting to deal with that. Parenting techniques that worked on your non-traumatised kids might not work. Check out r/fosterit and r/Adoption to find out that parenting a traumatised non-verbal and non-potty trained 6-yo is far tougher than a (non-verbal and non-potty trained) baby! The OP mentions being open to adoption on its own merits and that's absolutely wonderful. I encourage you to learn more about it, but just keep in mind that it presents its own challenges.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel for you. For me it wasn't the taste itself: sure I liked cheese, but I could overcome that, but more its omnipresence and convenience in our lives. What specifically are you eating and when? Milk itself was easy - just pick up a carton of Alpro instead of dairy and you're all set. Cheese used to be my go to sandwich filler, so I stocked up on hummus and vegan spreads. Put a tub of Alpro ice cream or sorbet in your freezer for when you want ice cream. Basically, if you have plenty of delicious food at home, you won't bother running to the store for dairy, so just stock up on vegan products. It's okay if you eat a bit of vegan junk food during your transition. For me, the challenge was eating out. If I'm going out with friends and there's nowhere with actual vegan options, we go for pizza and I ask for the cheese to be left off (do check the crust: all my local places have a vegan crust, but I've heard some US chains shove dairy in there).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Finding teens attractive isn't paedophilia. Being attracted to adolescents is completely normal, as physically, they're young adults, capable of getting pregnant and bearing children. Just two centuries ago, many girls would be married and become mothers before the age of 15. It doesn't mean that there were many more paedophiles back then. A relationship with a teenager would be hugely inappropriate today because of emotional maturity and the power dynamics within the couple, but it seems you're already aware of that.

Whatever you do, avoid Bubenec - it's infested with cockroaches (at least it was back in 2014 when I worked there). 3. Veggie here as well. If you cook for yourself, being veggie is dirt cheap.

Expect to pay about CZK 180 for a main meal and a soft drink, though you can certainly get cheaper deals if you look around (Dhaba Beas has self service bistros, where you pay by weight and Socialni Druzstvo Strecha does a lunch menu for CZK 100).</TEXT>

If you make it yourself, you can control the sugar, but then you're losing out on the fortifications. I mean, almond milk can certainly be part of a healthy diet if most of your other foods are unprocessed, and the other reasons for cutting out dairy are enough, but I'm struggling to find a criterion by which almond milk can be considered healthy.

    <TEXT>I don't see much of a point in comparing them. If we do, we find that yes: the suffering of a dairy cow is greater than that of a beef one, but then we'd also have to consider that a beef cow "yields" about 600 pounds of meat, whereas a dairy cow will produce 100 000 pounds of milk in her lifetime (but of course, that means 2-3 dead calves as well)... so is killing more animals for beef okay if their individual suffering is less intense.... but is it really less intense... what I'm saying is that comparing different means of torture seems unnecessary: just give up all of it. Yeah, it's important to spread the message that being vegetarian is not enough and that dairy is inherently cruel, but comparisons seem misleading to me.</TEXT>

I'm afraid he'll have to just do without music in the bathroom. If he doesn't want to be tethered to the device, he can get bluetooth headphones. 2) The next time your landlord calls you, don't engage him. Just say that you're really busy, but you're happy to pass on RM's number. 3) Honestly, I do feel the couple's expectations are a bit unrealistic, but there's not much you can do about it and I also feel for them - crying babies are hard and can skew your perception of the world.

    <TEXT>Talk to her, agree on quiet hours (11pm - 7am? - depends on your schedules) during which neither of you will play music, make phones calls or watch stuff without headphones. More likely than not, she will be glad you told her instead of silently resenting her. Here's a script I suggest, but feel free to use whatever wording you want: "Hey Linda, I was wondering if we could agree on set quiet hours for the room. I'm really sensitive to noise and while I totally get you want to facetime your boyfriend, I was wondering whether we could agree on no calls and music after 11 PM." In situations like this, I always try to play the "it's not you, it's me card" - like saying you're really sensitive to noise/light or obsessive about cleanliness... I think it protects the other person's feelings. Get noise cancelling headphones even if she agrees to quiet hours - they are a necessity when sharing a room. Also keep in mind that she's probably feeling a little homesick and lonely right now. It's unlikely she'll keep doing this once she makes new friends and is busy with classes and extracurriculars. But it's better to raise this now, rather then telling her half way through the year or requesting a room change. If I was doing something that annoyed my roommate, I'd want to know - not find out months later!</TEXT>

I usually air dry my clothes and wouldn't want my roommates putting them in the dryer, especially the nicer ones.

    <TEXT>I think these people are in a really weird place where they know how wrong eating meat, eggs and dairy is, so they feel guilty, but they don't actually give up animal products and instead they lie to themselves. It seems really weird to me; surely, if you feel that guilty, you would give it up, but apparently not. My roommate actually said she was giving up beef and dairy because of the methane footprint, which I was pretty happy about, but she never followed through with the dairy (c'mon, we share a fridge, I know what you're eating). Still, at least she isn't bragging that she did! And it does feel good that just by interacting with the people around you, you're forcing them to at least consider what they're eating and what are the consequences of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, your concerns are valid. In a flatshare, it's definitely not normal to have long term guests without asking permission first. Some flatmates will agree on formal rules (ie. max eight nights a month, text the roommate to give them a heads up...), but most just wing it and assume no one will be such a jerk to move in a third flatmate who doesn't pay! Anyways, I don't think waiting on it is a good idea - if you pent up your frustration, you might just blow up. Just be very matter of fact about, eg. "Hey, you know I really like Linda, but could you stay at her place some nights if you want to be together? This place isn't big enough for three people full time. I don't mind you having an occasional guest, but I really need my space and it's crowded here right now."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, from what I've **read**, your body doesn't really lose the ability to digest meat, so a few bites should be absolutely fine from a digestive viewpoint. Of course, you might be so repelled by the idea that you've consumed flesh, that you'll throw up psychosomatically (the way an omni might if they learned they had just eaten human). But honestly, what I've read didn't really match up with my **lived experience**. My journey towards veganism began with environmental concerns, so to start, I limited myself to just one meat containing meal a week (looking back, I can see I was a bit of a idiot for not going all the way, but nevermind that). So I'd eat veggie for the week and then indulge myself with a beef burger Sunday nights or some chicken wings. After just two months of this reductarian diet however, I started having GI issues with that one meat meal. Sometimes, they'd come immediately, other times it would take a while. After three consecutive Mondays when I'd come into work and head straight into the bathroom to violently vomit, I went full vegetarian. I'm not sure what was happening there - I mean, limiting meat shouldn't make you unable to digest it (afterall, before the 20th century in the west, most people would eat meat once a week at most because it was a luxury)... but my body was sending me some pretty clear signals and so I obeyed.</TEXT>

I wasn't really that much of a girly girl and hated having to wear earrings growing up. I'd take them out all the time, around 12 my mom stopped fighting the battle and just let it be. The hole healed and I'm so glad my ears are not pierced anymore. I'm a bit more feminine now (at 24) - I do enjoy long hair and dresses, but I still don't like any jewelry (or make up for that matter). So I just want to emphasise that not all women want earrings, even if they are cisgender. And I think you're a wonderful parent for recognising that and respecting Lucia's autonomy.

    <TEXT>Like everyone says, weight gain is caused by eating more calories than you burn. It's true that a vegan diet can often be lower in calories than an omni one, because you cut out a lot of foods with really high calorie content (think lard, butter, bacon or cheese) , but it's completely possible to overeat and underexercise as a vegan. It's a lot easier to overeat on white rice and white bread than on whole grains, because there's less fibre, so you feel less full. So buying only brown rice, wholegrain bread and pasta is one of the easiest changes you can make to be healthier. If you want, go ahead and post what you typically eat in a day/week + height + weight + activity level and we'll be happy to help find the best place to cut calories.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're correct that under-18s must have a guardian on set and work limited hours as not to interfere with their education. That said, there are shows which use teenagers to play teenagers - it's harder but not impossible, take Saved by the Bell. I found it interesting that you say that all the sophomores look like 12 year olds :) I mean, if all the sophomores look like 12 year olds, maybe our perception of who "looks 12" is wrong. When 15-year-olds are played by 25-year olds and 10-year-olds are played by 15-year-olds, our perception of what people look like at a certain age get skewed. The result is that you think that every single sophomore looks like they're 12, but it's just that 12-year-olds on screen are played by high school sophomores. For example, Caleb McLaughlin is 16, but plays 12-year old Lucas in Stranger Things - so we slowly get the idea that pre-teens look like Caleb McLaughlin... when they really don't. That's not great for body image issues - TV characters are often role models, but it's hard for teens to understand why their bodies don't look like what they see on TV.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is, fertilised eggs come almost exclusively from free range farms that throw a rooster into the flock to maintain a healthier social dynamic. There's 0% chance for a fertilised egg from caged hens, so if you want to avoid a fertilized egg, all you have to do is buy caged. I don't think that's consumer behaviour we seek to encourage!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a fellow European based in a major metropolitan area, it took me a while to understand that cars for teens aren't a luxury for those too lazy to take a tram. In most American rural and suburban areas, public transport is terrible or non-existent. Cars can often be the only way to get to work, which is why the driving age is lower over there. Also, most cars are automatics, so they're ridiculously easy to drive. Although schools are generally required to provide a schoolbus, that can be unreliable or take over an hour each way. When you live 40 miles from your school (think Utah) walking isn't really an option!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh definitely. I'm so angry with the proposed EU legislation that would ban battery cages - but fully compensate the egg farmers for costs associated with switching to deep litter indoor farming or free range. I feel like it's basically a measure to help people feel better about eating eggs. If the ban wasn't accompanied by compensation, it would at least drive prices up and demand down! What I was saying is that most consumers won't avoid embryos by not eating eggs, but rather by eating different eggs - which doesn't help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, running does cause some wear and tear to your joints. If you're comparing say, running and swimming in a lab setting, swimming is definitely easier on the joints. BUT: A sedentary lifestyle is the worst thing for joints, because being overweight is the highest risk factor for osteoporesis of all. And the fact of the matter is that for most working adults, putting in 10+ hours per week at the pool isn't as affordable, convenient or even realistic as running for the same amount of time. The take away is that basically any activity has some downsides and risks, but the benefits outweigh the disadvantages for basically every form of exercise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To play the devil's advocate though, a lot of ready meals rely on meat and cheese for most of the calories. A supermarket serving of plain pasta salad (without mayo) would have like 300 kcal - that's not a lunch. Of course, they could increase the size or put in a plant protein... but I fear we've got a long way to go before that happens... I'm actually annoyed when the only vegan option is a sandwich with just vegetables or a salad with no protein source. Just leaving out the meat isn't a valid strategy for veganising most meals. At home, my diet is built around beans, pulses and tofu and even then, my portion sizes are pretty big in terms of volume - I can't live off white flour and tomatoes!</TEXT>

I'd assume the average tourist would do like three attractions (that's like CZK 700) and get the three day travel pass (CZK 310)., which works out to CZK 1010 - the three day card is almost double that. That said, if you do a lot of museums and sites, it could be worth it - I suggest you plan out your itinerary first and figure it out that way. I mean, if you've been to London, I don't think the galleries here are worth it. You should definitely see the castle and the synagogues, but that works out cheaper paying as you go.</TEXT>

I can understand your argument about misrepresentation, but personally I feel that a positive portrayal still helps counter negative stereotypes about children in care. It seems ridiculous to say that you can't have any other media representation of foster care other than documentaries. That seems like a way to just decrease the visibility of the issue: because I don't know many families that go and see a documentary every week at their local movie theatre.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's nothing unhealthy about GMOs, plant breeding has been safely done since pre-industrial times. There are however some ecological issues: decrease in biodiversity, incidents of plants "escaping" the fields and taking root in other fields or natural environments, as well as an increase in secondary pests. I haven't done enough research to decide whether these outweigh the ecological advantages of GMOs (needs less soil for the same amount of food, decreases pesticide use by being pest-resistant), so I do eat them. Wheareas with animal products, their ecological impact is pretty obviously catastrophic.  #8203; It's just another way the public has been brainwashed into "oh no, GMO corn is unnatural"... while eating hormone filled flesh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh, I know I'm going to get downvoted for this, but it's possible to be a specieist and vegan. I don't eat animal products because the suffering and ecological impact is wholly unnecessary, thus unjustifiable. There's no need for steak or cheese, so causing insane pain to beings who are not quite human - but still very sentient, smart and capable of love and suffering is unethical. But if we're talking about situations where it really is the life of a human versus an animal life - eg. pig heart valves are often transplanted to humans with cardiac dysfunction - I'm going to choose the human life. It's just that such situations are very rare, despite what omnis would argue constitutes their "needs".</TEXT>

There's value to preserving a courteous relationship with your roommates, even if they're in the wrong. Would you personally want to live with someone who resents for destroying their property? I thought not. Just have an adult conversation - explain why it's inconsiderate and ask them to commit to cleaning them before they leave.

    <TEXT>I'm obviously not saying vegetarianism is great, but depending on how you do it, it can be better than a omni diet. First of all, the dairy industry is obviously terrible. But a dairy cow (count in two dead calves) produces 24 000 litres of milk in a lifetime, which is more dairy based meals than the 500 kg of beef from one. A laying hen will produce about 450 eggs in a lifetime, versus a few kilograms of meat. Counting it as meals per death, vegetarianism is generally better than a meat based diet. Counting it in terms of C02 emissions shows the same conclusion. An Average American #8217;s diet has a foodprint of around 2.5 t CO2e per person each year. For the Vegetarian it #8217;s 1.7 t CO2e and for the Vegan it is 1.5 t CO2e. Each of these estimates includes emissions from food that is eaten, wasted by consumers and lost in the supply chain. http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet And secondly, most vegetarians I know don't just sub in a block of cheese for meat at every meal. They're actively trying to reduce the amount of animal products they eat, but maybe still want to be able to go get a weekly pizza with friends or not worry about that 0,2% milk powder in potato chips. Vegetarianism is a lot easier than veganism, yet still brings some benefit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, try to return it if you can, but don't beat yourself up too bad. This is just what happens in a world filled with animal products... you will get served chicken when you order tofu, you will miss that milk powder ingredient in crisps and eat them anyway... I even managed to accidentaly grab a tuna sandwich this April (I always got the same vegan onion bhaji sandwich at the convenience store, and it was early morning, and it was a similar colour, didn't notice until lunch, I was on a hike and just ate it)... Your intentions are good, that already puts you ahead of most of the population.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. I understand your frustration. The cumulative effect of months of sleep deprivation is terrible - I've been there due to a noisy water heater and it's a horrible thing. The thing is, I think you've reached "Bitch Eating Crackers" stage with your roommate. What's that? Once you hate someone, everything they do is offensive: "Look at this bitch eating those crackers like she owns the place." It's not OK that they moved in their boyfriend for free, it's not OK that they selected the new roommate without any input from you. But it's also none of your business that they don't work, their mom covers their bills or that they're "abusing their freedom". You're upset about these issues because you're sleep deprived and frustrated about the other things, but they're actually not anything wrong in themselves - or at least not wrong in ways that are of your concern. It's unreasonable for you to police a "curfew" for your roommate. They are entitled to come home when they want and microwave a simple meal. But at the same time, you are entitled to a room where you can sleep. Go ahead, ask for the boyfriend to cover part of the utilities. Push back on your ex moving in. But most importantly - find a way to isolate the noise. This has to be poor house design - it's really not normal for someone on a different floor to hear the fridge door open. Look into soundproofing the place: even a sliding door can make a huge difference. I'm not saying you're wrong, but the solution here isn't to set a curfew for your roommate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adoption, is by definition preceded by trauma. At the very minimum, there's the trauma of separation from the birth family; in most cases, there's also the trauma that led to the separation in the first place (abuse, neglect or death). And infant adoptions are extremely rare. What's the difference between adopted and biological children? Trauma. An 8-year-old who's been in 8 different homes has severe attachment issues. It's naive to think you can parent them the way you would your biological child. It's parenting on hard and not everyone is equipped to meet the special needs of those children.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To avoid any misunderstanding, this is a hypothetical. Joel Simkhai is out, proud and an outspoken proponent of LGBT rights. To answer your question - there's nothing wrong with being straight, but there's plenty wrong with opposing LGBT equality. I think all non-bigots (gay or straight) should avoid companies like Chick-fil that actively fund bigoted politicians. By paying for that sandwich, you are funding the campaign of someone, who will get elected thanks to you and pass laws criminalising trans people or allowing LGBT workplace discrimination. I think consumers should be far more aware of what they're paying for anyway - like doing their best to avoid companies that use factory farming or child labour (it's not always possible to avoid these two 100%, but one should certainly try).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That Gallup study isn't inevitable proof either though. It's hard to measure how many people are gay or lesbian, because homosexual orientation does not always equal homosexual intercourse or identifying as such in a survey. But studies consistently show that in liberal environments, far more people identify as lgbt+, which the far right will interpret as the product of a homosexual conspiracy, but actually just shows that people are less likely to hide in the closet if they live in a time and space where they're less likely to suffer for being out (What a surprise!). You say 1.7%, I can pull up a reputable study which says that 20% are attracted to their own gender (note that that's a bit different thing than identifying as gay or lesbian). https://www.nber.org/papers/w19508 I'm not actually saying it's 20%, but given that these things are so hard to measure, you can't just take one study and cite it as gospel without considering its methodology. What I suggest you do is you look at multiple studies, you'll find that median findings are aroung 8% identifying as LGB. But you'll also find that certain demographics (young, college educated, urban populations) have rates that are double that - going back to my point about social construction of sexual orientation.</TEXT>

I was a transitioning vegetarian too and I definitely understand that not everyone goes vegan overnight. I get eating dairy because you have a 30 min lunch break and there's just nothing else nearby, or wanting to join your friends for dinner. Not saying it's great, but I get it. But to actively condone eating dairy? What the actual fuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, most farm sanctuaries also have a couple of dogs and cats and feed them vegan pet food. If you look at social media of such sanctuaries, they are vegan in name and practice (check out Happily Ever Esther, Zizzy's farm sanctuary or Goats of Anarchy). They will advertise their volunteers to bring a vegan lunch to workdays and will host "Thanksliving" vegan events. Such is the difference between farm sanctuaries and pet shelters. And as has been discussed on this sub a gazillion times, if you only love cats and dogs you're not an animal lover, you're a pet lover. That said, pet lovers are quite prone to becoming animal lovers once they realise how similar pigs and cows are to their loved ones. So they're actually the ideal audience for a -"Wait, eating animals is not a good event plan for an animal rescue."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A "rodn #233;  #269; #237;slo" is assigned to citizens (at birth) and to foreigners (upon request) by the Ministry of Interior. If you have temporary residency, you should be able to find this number on your ID card. If you have a " #382;ivnostensk #253; list", it should be mentioned in the decision. Basically, if it has already been assigned, it will be on most official paper work - the rodn #233;  #269; #237;slo is a general identifier used not only by VZP, but basically by all state institutions. You mention your date of birth. If you are male, your rodn #233;  #269; #237;slo will start with 820728. If you are female, your rodn #233;  #269; #237;slo will start with 825728. However, I can't tell you the last four digits, as they are randomly assigned by the ministry. Fun fact: All rodn #225;  #269; #237;sla are divisible by 11!</TEXT>

Your other expenses will obviously depend on how frugal you are: I've known students who only spent 1.500 a month on food, but that takes some serious willpower. If you budget 6.000, this would give you enough to eat out for lunch every workday. You still have a decent chunk left for incidentals and some savings. A studio would be about 14.000 - 20.000 including bills, so I don't think you can afford it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends. Customer service can mean a lot of things - from entry level inbound call centre work to client management. Relocation expenses are also really dependant on circumstances. I'd expect the company to pay if I was being transferred within the same company or if they reached out to me first, asking if I would be open to moving for their job. If you have a skill set that's in high demand, you can get relocation assistance even if that isn't the case: for example, relocation assistance is practically standard in IT. Or if OP has say, some special skills or niche languages (like Dutch or Chinese). But if a company has good local candidates, they have no reason to offer relocation expenses just because a candidate chooses to apply from abroad. And generally, junior positions are easier to fill, there's less of a need to find the perfect candidate (as opposed to just good enough). Few companies I know would pay for relocation expenses for something as generic as a junior customer service position, if the foreign languages are common (German, English...).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sexual attraction to teens is normal. Acting on it isn't. There's a reason why paedophilia is defined as attraction to prepubescent children (generally under 13). From a biological perspective it's normal to be attracted to teens, biologically they have achieved sexual maturity. Looking back just a hundred years, girls would be married and bear children between the ages of 13 and 20. It doesn't mean that everyone back then was a paedophile, just that societal norms were different and people reached emotional maturity earlier. Now, acting on those feelings would be seriously wrong in today's world. A 15 year old isn't making a free and informed choice when agreeing to have intercourse with a 40 year old. But theres no reason to hate yourself or believe you are sick just for having these feelings. Again sexual attraction to teens is completely normal (sorry to use heteronormative examples, but note the sexualisation of teen girls on television). Acting on with someone under 18 is seriously fucked up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you're saying: cheese and cured meats are already done, so just add it to literally anything and it's satisfying. But after a while, you learn how to cook vegan and it becomes very simple as well (have a few simple recipes and just rotate the veggies). You can cheat with fake meats, smoked tempeh, etc. And for beginning cooks, one huge advantage of cooking vegan is that the risk of food poisoning is much lower. If you undercook meat or eggs, you are in for salmonella. If you undercook veggies or tofu, it might taste a bit bland. Same goes for leaving it out a bit too long after cooking or refreezing... really scary with meat, no big deal with vegan ingredients.</TEXT>

So if you're just asking about quality of life, I'd say go for it. On a different note, I personally wouldn't get married and move halfway across the world after a year of dating. But that's a very personal thing and I don't know you or your relationship. But it's something to consider. Your residency will be tied to your marriage (you can apply for citizenship after 5 years). So do think about the possibility if the relationship doesn't work out, including the fact that an economic downturn will come to Europe sooner than later.

    <TEXT>There's a point to the accredited vegan signs regulated by national vegan societies. Even if you read the ingredient list, that doesn't tell you whether a certain additive was derived from plant or animal sources (vitamin D for instance can come from animals or moss/fungi/seaweed; glycerids can be obtained from animal fat or vegetable oils) or if an animal product was used during filtering a liquid (wines and juices are often filtered through gelatin, but since it doesn't stay in the drink it doesn't have to be disclosed). I personally have decided to just buy such items anyway, because well, my veganism is more a utilitarian than an absolutist stance. But it's unfortunate that even reading labels isn't enough if you want to be a purist.</TEXT>

In terms of more general advice, I wouldn't just set out to do a masters because you think it might boost your career.

    <TEXT>Yup. And also, the top picture isn't really a balanced diet in itself. It's really hard to get enough daily calories from fresh fruits and vegatables alone (you'd have to eat about eleven pounds of fresh produce a day to hit 2000 kcal and your aminoacid profile still wouldn't be great). Plus, you wouldn't be getting any fat, which your body needs. I eat a lot of lentils and nuts, as well as tofu, fake meats, grains and yes - junk food.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the word plant based is a bit unfortunate. The actual meaning is a diet that excludes all animal products, but if you haven't heard it before, you'll just interpret it as "based on plants". But "based on plants" doesn't actually exclude all animal products. Look at these examples of similar phrases: * If a movie is "based on a true story" you know that something similar actually happened, but there's definitely an artistic license. * Evidence-based medicine relies on research on why a treatment works, but it also takes patient preferences into account. * Inquiry-based learning starts by asking questions, but that doesn't mean other methods can't be used in the classroom at all. * A competency-based job interview will involve a practical exercise (like solve this problem, write a sample), but that doesn't mean it won't include talking about working hours and pay. So if I were just guessing what plant based means, I'd assume that it's mostly plants but wouldn't automatically rule out small amounts of animal products. That's not how the word is actually used, but I think the label maker might have been more ignorant than malicious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, if it's this bad I'd consider a vegan meal replacement shake. Huel in the UK, but I'm sure there's an American equivalent. I used it for a bit as a student with limited access to kitchen, although I eventually just found it more satisfying to cook for myself. But if the idea of cooking every meal from scratch is so daunting, it might be a start. Nobody enjoys doing things they're not good at. But the more you cook, the easier it will get and the more enjoyable. Here's some convenience meals that don't really require cooking. Maybe just try cooking a couple of times a week and use a replacement shake for the rest. Now, they're not super-duper-ultra-healthy, but for me, they are convenient enough: \- Cooking veggies seems difficult and they come out soggy? Fine. Buy oil in a mist spray bottle, buy the veggies in a frozen medley, buy an "italian herb mix". Put down a sheet of baking paper, spread out the frozen veggies, spray with oil, season. Roast in the oven on 180 celsius for twenty minutes. If you have enough broccolli in there, this can actually be a main meal, but add a faux meat (vegan sausage or burger) if you want. \- Baked beans. Yeah, they have sodium, but they're still really nutritious. \- Cous cous doesn't really require "cooking" per se. Buy whole grain, put it in a pot and pour over with water (1 part water to 2 part cous cous). In a seperate pan, put a block of frozen spinach, some more frozen veggies and just cook until hot. Use your spice mix, a little salt, add to the cous cous. Done.  #8203; I think you get the picture. It's daunting to just start cooking from scratch. But there's plenty of "cheats" in the kitchen with frozen and canned veggies or faux meats that are way better for you than fries. Now eventually, you'll realise that cleaning and cutting veggies is a piece of cake. But for me, starting with a kilo bag of frozen medley was a life saver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lawyer here. In theory, the company could sue you for damages caused by breach of contract - such as the costs of hiring a contractor to cover the work or the cost of losing a client since they could no longer deliver the promised workproduct on time. However, this doesn't really happen in practice, because it's extremely difficult for the employer to prove the damages and courts tend to side with employees anyway. But I still wouldn't recommend leaving without notice, as it will be devastating to your professional reputation. Forget about ever getting a reference from the place and expect that if your former coworkers move on to different companies, you will likely be blacklisted there as well. Most employees don't want a disgruntled employee showing up to work anyways, so you can always see if you can agree on an earlier end date. If not, I'd suck it up unless the situation is really bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course. There are plenty of vegan sanctuaries that rescue farmed animals and give them a happy life. Veganism is against exploitation and cruelty, taking care of an animal is neither. Generally, vegans spay or neuter where applicable as there's just so many animals that need help, it seems cruel to bring more into the world.

    <TEXT>It's just the economics. Currently, a farmer who rapes a cow and kills her baby makes $ X for the milk and $Y for the meat. If nobody wants the milk, you will probably send the cow to slaughter earlier or lower the price of the milk so that someone is more likely to buy it. Therefore, the farmer might make only $ X-500 for the milk. At that point, several things can happen - farmer will go out of business or veal prices will rise accordingly (thus lowering demand) and over time, the whole industry gets smaller and less profitable. BUT that's actually pretty optimistic and a ceteris paribus theoretical model. Overall, the world is getting richer and consuming more and more meat, just because it can afford to. Look at the latest USDA reports that show that US meat consumption is continuously rising. Milk - as in cartons - is declining, but products like yogurt and cheese are going strong. It's super complicated and hard to predict what exactly will happen with animal product consumption in our lifetimes.</TEXT>

This is an example of how dividing limited resources will always be touchy, but it still makes sense to hear everyone out and brainstorm options, which is ultimately fair. Brushing everything off with a "life isn't fair" is ridiculous, because it conflates sharing a room with arbitrary discrimination or pointless suffering. I recommend you start justifying your actions with a better argument than "Life isn't fair so I've decided to act unfairly to exacerbate injustice in the world.</TEXT>

It's unlikely to go mainstream within a few years (cost), but if it does... so what.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't wait another two weeks. She needs as much time as possible to find a new place to live. This isn't as personal as you're making out to be. Just tell her you're moving in with your boyfriend and when will she need to move out (the wording gnapster has suggested is excellent). She probably won't be happy about moving, but she'll understand. People get that couples will want to live together at some time. You're not doing anything wrong by terminating her lease - but what would be wrong would be to give her insufficient notice.</TEXT>

When done well and motivated by ethics (think someone who eats mostly vegan, but will eat vegetarian food at a business lunch with no vegan options), vegetarianism can be much more considerate to animals and the planet than an omni diet, although obviously still worse than veganism. When done by eating paneer with cream for every meal, it's just as bad as an omni diet.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"No Good Nick" is such a bad show</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-20 20:21:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>No Good Nick popped up on my Netflix, so I gave it a shot. It's truly a despicable depiction of the kids in the foster care system. The basic premise is that the main character Nicole ("Nick") enters the foster care system after her dad ends up in prison. Her foster parents are con artists and so they set up a scam where she pretends to be a long lost relative of a wealthy family, who takes her in. Cue shenanigangs to steal the wealthy family's money, of course mixed in with sacharine sweet scenes when she realises she actually grows to love the family she set out to scam. I don't even know where to begin about everything that's wrong with the show. It paints foster kids as street smart scammers. It doesn't address a single point about trauma or attachment. It paints foster parents as con artists, but with a strange soft spot for the children they exploit. It paints the foster care system as completely incompetent on one hand, but unreasonably overprotective on the other. There's a whole episode where the SSO is slipped a fake file, so they believe that Nicole is meant to live with the wealthy family, but they send over a family therapist who threatens to remove her for not opening up enough.  #8203; I mean, it's a sitcom. It doesn't have to be comprehensive or a 100 % realistic depiction. But it shouldn't pander to the worst stereotypes out there!</TEXT>

The way you're presenting this feels very focused on her autism and not her as a person at all (" I was surprised by how sweet and charming the autistic roommate was. I appreciate her much more than my sister seems to. ") I think that your sister should treat her roommate basically the same way she'd treat a neurotypical roommate.

    <TEXT>I think the main issue here is that your parents seem overinvolved in your sister's life. Part of going away to college is learning how to live like an adult and figure these things out on their own. Of course she's responsible for cleaning up after herself, but she's no longer a five-year-old being forced into chores with a sticker chart. She needs to be given an opportunity to take care of herself without your parents' intervention. And her relationship with her roommate is really up to her. Of course, she SHOULD be courteous, kind and respectful: but she's an adult and your parents don't get to police that anymore. And I'm going to repeat that there's no obligation to go beyond that common courtesy - you don't have to be best friends with your roommate and her autism doesn't change anything about that.</TEXT>

But I feel like there's far less mainstream penetration in terms of vegan options at meat-serving establishments or supermarket ready meals. Faux meats and dairy alternatives are generally imported and expensive (for instance, Alpro is about 2.70 EUR here, which is double of what it costs in Germany and until recently, the supermarkets didn't have a cheap generic alternative). It's definitely getting better though!</TEXT>

Cross-contamination (eg. using the same grill for vegan as meat burgers) does not create a demand and does not create a profit for the meat and dairy industry. My roommate's an omni, so most of what I eat may have some trace cross-contamination, I can live with that. The example you gave is a bit more complicated. I would send that pizza back because I want to teach the restaurant that when I order a vegan pizza, I actually want a vegan pizza and not something that contributes towards the demand for meat and dairy.</TEXT>

Globally, less than a quarter of the cartons are recycled (though this is very region dependent). However, I dislike vegans bickering with each other over every plastic piece of packaging. Plastic waste is definitely a problem, but you can't look at an individual's foot print solely through the optic of plastic waste - I hate people who will boast about turning down a straw while eating a steak. Individuals need to focus their energy where it's efficient for them to do so. For example, making my own milk is not for me, but I live car-free.</TEXT>

Most of the "vegan baby died" stories are basic neglectful parents, who were accidentally vegan (if you give your baby a couple of potatoes a week, that's a vegan diet I guess).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, electronics here are generally slightly more expensive than in the US. It makes sense - it's all imported from China, so it's pretty much the same price worldwide, the main differences being caused by taxes and import tariffs. That said, 12 k is average. You can definitely get one cheaper, but expect lower quality (thus using more electricity, being louder, more prone to frosting, etc.). Check out the links for details.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>10k is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum. Not saying it's impossible, but pretty unlikely given that you don't have local connections. I'd budget closer to 15k including utilities. That still shouldn't be a problem with 37k net unless you're sending money back home or paying off debt. Prague really isn't "cheap" anymore. The housing situation is amongst the worst in Europe. Services are still very cheap, think 140 CZK for lunch at a restaurant. 3200 CZK for an annual transport pass. It can still be a great place to live if you've got an above average salary (Prague average is 39 gross, which is like 29 net) as you can eat out all the time, but as Czechs are getting richer, it's no longer "dirt cheap" for westerners. And honestly, that's a good thing.</TEXT>

But they do discriminate in practice and as a foreigner, I don't think your chances of fighting back is good. If you admit the dog upfront, you'll never prove it was the reason you didn't get the apartment (it's an extremely tight market as it is and there will be dozens of others that got rejected). If you lie beforehand, you'll establish a hostile relationship with your landlord, who can terminate your contract with a three month notice (there's some conditions, but again, easy to circumvent in practice). So I'd just be honest and find a landlord's who is ok with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The hospital will file a court claim. The court will send you a *platebn #237; rozkaz* that you can dispute, but I doubt you're competent enough to do so. So the hospital will ask for the *platebn #237; rozkaz* to be enforced by an *exekutor.* At that point, the charges go rapidly up and the debt can be enforced by selling any property you have, deducting the money from your bank account or wages (if you're employed). Fleeing the country - to the US no less - doesn't really seem like a smart plan. The larger point is - what are those medical bills for? If you're a resident, you should have public health insurance to cover the cost of your medical care. And if you chose to have a non-covered procedure done, or for some reason aren't on public health insurance - it seems strange to me that you're surprised by the charges. Surely you knew beforehand it would cost money! Anyways, I suggest you pay up and maybe stop overeating. I know you like to brag about having a dozen doughnuts for breakfast or four lunch menus in a single day, but it's obviously not doing your health any favours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, remember that Adnan never actually called Hae's house and let it ring: they'd page each other first and then one would call the weather so the other could call in through call waiting. So if we're in this hypothetical Adnan-thinks-it's-just-a-funny-story scenario, he wouldn't just call the house. He'd page her first. But he never paged her - and that's where all the things you said apply: it's fishy. And surely, once he came into school Monday and learned she's still missing, Innocent Adnan would start panicking and try to contact her. But he didn't.</TEXT>

It's really uncommon to live in Prague (where housing costs are high, justified by its excellent job market) and work in D #283; #269; #237;n (where salaries are correspondingly lower, as is cost of living). And in most fields, getting a job in Prague right now is pretty easy.

Pilsen is a nice city, but if you want to do the sights, the brewery and synagogue are of course about two hours each.

By my mid-twenties, my palpitations were much less frequent but it happened to show up on a routine ECG and it just so happened the cardiologist I was referred to specialised in arrythmia. The WPW was clear from the ECG, I had an ultrasound done as general due diligence before the surgery itself. I had an ablation (which is a very minor surgery) and I've been symptom-free ever since. However, irregular heart beat is a very general symptom and no one here is qualified to give you medical advice. My WPW was more of an example - it really could be anything. And an important note, I had been running for a couple of years before the surgery itself. I did have a few times where I had to stop because of the arrythmia, but overall it was fine. Exercise is good for your cardiovascular health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Prague and I run pretty much year round. Running really warms you up, so long leggins and a light fleece or wind breaker are fine even when it hits below zero. Get gloves - even cheap cotton ones are fine. You might need another layer since you're used to warmer temperatures. Running in the winter is awesome. Everything looks so peaceful and parks aren't as crowded. It's infinitely easier to run in the cold than in the summer heat anyways. I'm actually more surprised you manage to run outside year round in Australia. However, I don't run on ice. It's not impossible to do but I really wouldn't recommend it if you aren't used to it (and since you won't have the right shoes). If it does get icey (which it might not at all, depends on the year and where you'll be at the time of the worst winter cold), I suggest you just find a gym. Incidentally, gyms are affordable in Prague - about 8 euros for a day pass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mushrooms are much lower in calories than meat. 100 g of mushrooms is 13 kcal. 100 g of chicken breast is 100 kcal. Most plant whole foods are much higher in fibre and lower in calories than meat. This is generally a good thing! But it does mean that you have to eat much higher volumes of food - replacing beef for broccoli gram for gram wont work. The most "protein dense" foods would be tofu, lentils and yeah, faux meats. The nutritional value of fqux meats varies greatly - read labels!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You sound very nice and considerate and she's lucky to have you. It does sound like she's a bit lonely or homesick, or at least having some trouble adjusting to college life. And I'm glad you're considerate of that, though of course you also need to think for yourself. You're paying for that room and you should get to use it comfortably. I think the TV is definitely something you should bring up. Just explain that it's really distracting. Could bluetooth head phones be a solution? Or just talk to her about a general guideline of how much TV in a day you can bear. Now, her being in the room is trickier, because as you said - it's not very nice to tell her she can't be in a safe space she's paying for. On the other hand, I understand if you feel like you can't get a moment alone because of this. I think you could make some suggestions about events, libraries and clubs, but if she doesn't take you up on that, I wouldn't push it. If you want to get closer, you could try talking to her about how things are going overall at college and if she's feeling alright - but it's also perfectly understandable if you don't want to involve yourself. So if she doesn't change, it's probably better to think about what you can do to make yourself more comfortable: a privacy partition, bluetooth headphones of your own, a sleep mask, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He certainly didn't kill 200 people and the building wasn't really a hotel in the sense that you'd actually check in. You should always verify things you read instead of sharing them - it's still a very interesting story! From Wikipedia: While he confessed to 27 murders, only nine could be plausibly confirmed and **several of the people he claimed to have murdered were still alive. He is said to have killed as many as 200, though this figure is only traceable to 1940s pulp magazines.** Many victims were said to have been killed in a mixed-use building which he owned, located about 3 miles (5 km) west of the 1893 World's Fair: Columbian Exposition, supposedly called the World's Fair Hotel (informally called "The Murder Castle"), **though evidence suggests the hotel portion was never truly open for business.** Besides being a serial killer, Holmes was also a con artist and a bigamist, the subject of more than 50 lawsuits in Chicago alone. Many now-common stories of his crimes sprang from fictional accounts that later authors assumed to be factual. In a 2017 biography, Adam Selzer wrote that Holmes' story is "effectively a new American tall tale  #8211; and, like all the best tall tales, it sprang from a kernel of truth".\[3\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi :) Roommate living has its pros and cons, but I definitely think the savings are worth it. Basically, my advice is to "interview" your roommates - insist on meeting everyone to have a nice friendly chat and see if you click. All of the things you ask work differently depending on the flatshare arrangement and you should ask about them before picking a flat. But here are some general thoughts based on my experience: \- Kitchen: in my flat, we share basics like oil, ketchup or coffee. We each have our section of the fridge and separate cabinets for everything else. One disadvantage is that you have to be a bit more diligent about cleaning up right away, because any messes will prevent others from using the kitchen. \- Guests: Having someone over occasionally is not a problem, but it shouldn't be an extra non-paying roommate. My rule of thumb is no more than 4 consecutive days and no more than 8 days in a calendar month. And of course, things change significantly during shelter-in-place orders - then you can't have anyone over. Overall, I'm really happy to have one roommate. It's a perfect balance between privacy and companionship and between space and money. Feel free to ask any more questions!</TEXT>

And if you look at say, UVN bookings, they are showing appointments on Wed the 16th for out-of-pocket and Thu the 17th for referred patients. Generally though, a test doesn't actually help you: it helps everyone around you. OP wanted a fast result because of the wedding, but I'd probably just stay in bed and watch Netflix until the system managed to process me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked a job and worked out throughout my period at university. With a good work ethic and basic time management skills, you should be fine without any extra assistance. There are provisions for individual study plans for professional athletes, but that's only for the very top ones (eg. the Czech Olympic Team). I don't think it's reasonable to expect accomodations at the amateur level, since so many students manage that without extra support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course, it does make a difference. SAD (seasonally affective disorder) is a real thing. There are studies linking climate to mental health and less sunny places have more depressed people, as well as more suicides. But personally, I don't mind it. One thing that helped me was learning to enjoy nature in the fall and winter. It's still possible to run and hike outside now - in fact, I prefer this weather to the blistering summer heat. Try to make it a point to spend time in nature and you might find out it's pretty nice. Under normal circumstances, I'd also recommend regular social activities (hiking with friends, board game nights, bowling)... but there's a pandemic, so not right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, it seemed overexplained. We can see what's happening on screen and the narrator is repeating it over and over again. At this point, I couldn't wait for the show to be over. It's a 90 minutes of material stretched out over 9 hours, literally feels like a student trying to stuff their essay to hit the wordcount.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Henry's change of heart (spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:33:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So what spurs Henry's change from "don't call me unless someone's injured" to "I love you, let's move to America together"? Let's be clear, Henry fails in his basic duties as a guardian. He leaves the children in a vacation home in the middle of nowhere. He doesn't try very hard to hire an au-pair, so most of the time, the kids are cared for by the housekeeper (who has other things to do). Flora doesn't attend school at all in the two years following her parents' death (though she did so before, Mrs. Grose asks her about her year when she arrives with her parents to Bly). And it would have been so easy to be a better guardian without major lifestyle changes on Henry's part - move the kids to London (where they probably used to live anyway, Bly was just a vacation home), hire a nanny there and send the kids to a posh day school (there's plenty of them in London). Oh, and get them therapy. The banishing from Bly doesn't seem to have been paranormal, he is able to return without any issues in the finale. This feels like a major logic gap in the show and it's not the only one. The inconsistencies abound.</TEXT>
