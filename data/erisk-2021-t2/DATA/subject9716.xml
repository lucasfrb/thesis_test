    <DATE>2020-01-09 11:12:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So here's the deal I am ranting the fact that Khufra does not actually need a roam item as a tank.So I believe that he's as essential being as high level as possible as quickly as possible.As much as a detriment it may be to the team if Khufra wants to even think about helping out his teammates he needs to be leveled up as fast as possible.Before you call me noob or doesnt know what hes talking about in the comments 300+ matches with khufra 60+% wr And played with him in Mythic many times Also guys you should actually use him more since I barely see anyone plays him in rank Feel free to discuss</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes but can you get s1 and s2 in the first few minutes of the game with a roam item?Also with the amount of jungle in the game it would be fine for most junglers.The way I do it is minions buff then walkie grass then gold and if possible opponents jungle.That's more than enough to get lvl 4 with jungle knife.Also calling me trash makes you look like an ass so stop using it in your arguments if you actually want people to listen to your points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you think I dont know that theres a reason why most of the khufra dont or have roam item builds?I know that having a roam item allows the carry to get lvl 4 much faster but I feel that a khufra limits himself with a roam item at the start.I do allow the carry to get the level 4 first.Its just that I feel that it is as essential khufra has to get near or the same level to help a higher rate of confirm kills.Also it's not really facts and bullshit if it's coming from my own personal experience playing as him.What makes you think your experiences out value others if you are not the one playing the same way?Also I was saying that calling people trash and to get good is the most sure fire way for most people not to listen to your points when arguing not that I didnt care about your response.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can we talk about how bad the Moniyan Empire actually is?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-15 14:00:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Case 1:Terizla where the Empire killed his entire race and then experimented on him till was completely broken. Case 2:Cecellion and Caramilla where the greedy rich people in the Empire who wanted more power made her father forced her to marry someone she didn't love and how he imprisoned her before causing her to commit suicide. Case 3:Literally caused Gusion to be disowned by his family at how good he was at his style of magic. Case 4:Literally everyone who broke free from their imprisonment by the Empire who was supposed to contain them well like Terizla or Khufra.You'd think with people with this much power would be taken better care of. Case 5:They are a strong advocate for peace despite being unable to control their own region like how they were unable to control the Magic Academy and how people like Selena and Dyrotth were kidnapped. (I'm free to discuss but man when you really read into the lore it really looks like the Moniyan Empire is almost as bad as the other Kingdoms)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you okay?You realise he can just ignore people who are trying to follow him right.Also "good reason to believe you are inexperienced" what kind of stupid argument is that?How does that relate to the problem at hand of this guy purposely throwing the game and me trying to warn others if they see this person in a ranked game?Also insulting a person really doesn't help your argument if you're trying to even argue this.Its not like sent his home adress to dox him or something right?I didn't go so far as to do that?Also about the inexperience part I have played over 1242 matches 61% win rate since you wanted to bring up irrelevant statements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mate chill I did use the odd potion stop assuming stuff you weren't in the match.Also remember calling people names isn't really pushing your point across you know that right?He was stealing both of our teams buffs the entire game.And I've been the one calmly talking my points through and you don't bother to hear my side without hurling insults and now I'm making a useless point about how you're insulting me which is no longer relevant to the situation at hand.So please think thoroughly before speaking because seriously making assumptions without hearing the other side out is a makes it an extremly one sided argument that has no point in continuing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Then why start with a statement literally saying I am inexperienced? I was not using this as an opportunity to send out people to witch hunt him I was sending out a warning to people if they ever found him in ranked.I had no ill will towards him besides the fact and above all else just tell people about him.Also he could literally just reject their requests to follow him it wouldn't be such a big deal considering they can't do anything unless he allows them to follow him anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is an estimated 1.35 billion cubic kilometers of water in the oceans. The average whale ejaculates 1500 liters of cum each load. The average whale breeds once every two years and lives between 40-100 years. Currently there are around 1.3 million whales. A whale on average breeds 13- 43 times in their life. Only 10% of the whales cum makes it into the partner so each time around 1350 liters gets into the ocean. With 1.3 million whales breeding on average 28 times and 1350 liters getting into the ocean that #8217;s 50 billion liters of cum! 0,0038% of the ocean is whale cum, per cubic mete(1000 liters) there is 3 liters of cum.

    <DATE>2020-09-07 10:30:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt.</TEXT>
