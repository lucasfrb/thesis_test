    <TITLE>My puppy won #8217;t potty outside</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-17 13:03:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last week I finally got the green light from my vet to let me walk my dog outside. He #8217;s been just fine and he #8217;s very good at walking with a leash, but the problem comes when he has to do his business. He holds it in for the whole walk and even after he smells everything he just won #8217;t pee and will just wait till we get back to the apartment to use his pee pad. Is this a normal thing? Or does it need training? also I #8217;ve walked him a total of four times but my vet said that he would potty outside automatically.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 3 month old puppy is very energetic. He loves to run around the house and to play but when we go outside he isn #8217;t as half as energetic. The first thing he does when we go walking is sitting down or just completely laying down. I keep repeating to him the  #8220;c #8217;mon #8221; command that used to work but now it doesn #8217;t. I have to pull his leash multiple times and say cmon to get him to get up. I used to think that I walked too fast and he couldn #8217;t catch up but no because even if i walk slow he won #8217;t even try to keep up. It #8217;s so frustrating. And sometimes i think maybe he #8217;s tired but the second we get home he starts running and jumping. I don #8217;t know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pietro ( 3 month old yorkie ) has trouble walking and doing his business outside, so today i took him on a walk determined to do better. We walked very little because i wanted to focus less on exercise and more on him getting used to the environment and it worked !! He smelt the grass for a whole five minutes but finally he peed outside! I gave him a treat and celebrated him because this is such a big step for him! I #8217;m so proud.  #129402; #10024;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-28 11:26:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am absolutely done with this. People need to understand that nasty behavior in puppies is still nasty behavior regardless of the breed. So finally my family met my yorkie puppy and they love him but they #8217;re also incredibly annoying about him. My dog bites when we play and I #8217;ve been trying to train him to inhibit biting during playtime, but my family keeps saying that bites are not an issue and that it #8217;s cute. I #8217;m sorry but cUte????? Would it still be cute if it were a full grown german shepherd trying to bite you while you play? No it wouldn #8217;t, so it shouldn #8217;t be considered cute just because a dog is small. People are out here talking trash about bigger breeds when they do something nasty but is automatically cute when a small dog does the same thing. Makes no sense. People need to understand that a Pitbull doesn #8217;t equal bad and a Corgi doesn #8217;t equal good. All dogs can have behavioral issues regardless of their size and appearance and people need to understand that. I am absolutely done with everyone thinking my dog #8217;s nasty behaviors are cute just because he #8217;s tiny, because let me tell you it isn #8217;t cute when you just woke up, you open his crate and he starts bitting you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand what you #8217;re saying, but what really annoys me more than the biting is that people will forgive any kind of behavior if it comes from a small dog. My best friend has a super well behaved pitbull and people think she #8217;s aggressive just because of the breed, while really bad behaved small dogs just get called cute. It makes me really sad to see my friend having to walk his dog with a muzzle just because people think she #8217;s aggressive when in reality it #8217;s nothing like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve never owned a dog before or even been around dogs in my life so what may seem obvious to me it isn #8217;t. So I #8217;ve noticed a kinda weird attitude in my dog whenever he meets other dogs and I #8217;d love if someone could tell me what it means. So whenever we approach a dog he will starts leash pulling and throw his ears back. Then if the other dog also approaches him he #8217;ll sniff his face and starts kinda  #8220;slapping #8221; the other dog with his paws and that #8217;s the moment when I pull him away because I #8217;m not sure if what he #8217;s doing is normal, friendly or aggressive.

    <TITLE>Crate or Playpen?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 12:32:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently wanted to buy my dog a crate since everyone speaks wonders about crate training but I realized they were awfully expensive, so I #8217;d like to know if it #8217;d be okay to crate train a dog but with a playpen. Right now and since I got my pup he #8217;s had a play pen with a little bed in it and a pee pad. It has done wonders for me because whenever i put him in it he #8217;ll sleep for at least two hours, and he also spends the whole night in there. So is it that bad to replace a crate for a playpen?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s never to late to start that process! I really recommend the playpen, maybe you can start leaving him there for short periods of time, first day 15 min then 30 and then in no time he #8217;ll be in there for two hours, I promise! He #8217;ll learn to entertain himself with his own toys instead of doing bad things around the house :D</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-04 12:18:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>First things first I want to clarify that I am not the person getting misgendered, but as a cis person it still makes me feel bad how some people will just not respect the identity of others. So there #8217;s this guy who i share a few classes with and a couple weeks ago he came out as trans ftm nobody said anything really, just me and my friend who were happy for him. Thing is, he changes his name on zoom, he puts his pronouns too and he even has the trans flag as his icon. But the teachers keep dead-naming him and using the wrong pronouns and it #8217;s so infuriating, do they not realize the damage they #8217;re doing to that student? If I were him I #8217;d feel like shit, so I can #8217;t even begin to imagine how he feels right now. He built up the courage to discover his true self and to come out to us and people treat him like that? So fucking disrespectful.</TEXT>
