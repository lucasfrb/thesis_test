    <TITLE>[TOMT] Comic - Humans continue to grow throughout their lives.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-12 22:36:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>The author/narrator was kept up late at night (I think by a barking dog) and imagined a world where humans continued to grow throughout their lives like lizards. There are many sections to it, about how society would have to adapt, to people living in different scales. A notable panel of him talking to his enormous grandfather. And how at the end of their lives the elderly are sent out into the wilderness to die. I saw it on Imgur once, and remember liking it.</TEXT>
