    <TITLE>A PLs power to make planetside 2 great for everyone or to ruin it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-25 14:17:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>as a platoonlead, you have a lot of respondsability. To attack the right areas, knowing when to retreat and defending key locations while doing the most important thing: making everyone in your platoon have fun. But I've noticed a trend along planetside 2s history that certain outfit platoons drive up a lattice line mercilessly with 48 vs less than 12 enemies. All factions do this, this post is not to say: TRID ZERG CANCER, TTRO ZERG CANCER. But more to point out to everyone who platoonleads that playing the game in a way so that the enemy side has their fun ruined is not good for the games life or to bring in new players. Sure "easy territory captures" is a stragety to do with few defenders, but is it really necerssary to drop an entire platoon of 48 men to take a base defended by less than 12 who most likely aren't even in a squad? For the sake of the future of the game and to make it fun for everyone, I say PLs on all sides should start trying to avoid overpopping fights like the plague.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>add some platforms we can build cheaply please, it would also help with the addition of snapable buildings/walls so that we can actually build bases. Adding a foundation before building the base will also give players who aren't communicating a way to see "okay put wall here so it follows the foundation" Tell me your ideas and critism to the idea!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since the HA has an air deterence directive tree. And we get XP for damaging aircraft, why don't we get XP for damaging tanks with our rockets instead of doing a tiny splash damage with no reward what so ever. Also can we PLEASE have the rocket launcher directive reworked, getting 1000 kills on a launcher just promotes people to run around and using them as primaries which is just pure cancer. So I thought we should change them to damage done, say fx 10k damage done for an auraxium medal etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The most awkward moment I've had in the field I regularly play on was during a team death match game. I was the last guy alive on our team. With no respawns left, but neither does the enemy. I search slowly around the map with my Thompson held ready, checking corners and the usual peaking spots etc. Ref asks over the speaker if anyone on the enemy team is still alive because no shooting has been happening for 5 minutes. Turns out 1 guy is still alive, about 30 seconds after that. I turn a corner but forget to check my right side, the guy was sitting there holding a Beretta M9 and somehow misses both his shots at a 6 ft distance. Then I turn and aim at him and he just throws his hands in the air and surrenders to avoid being shot at point blank. Then we both laugh at how fucking stupid that just was. This like this is why I love airsoft!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rebuff vehicles to pre-CAI levels but reintroduce the timers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-07 10:15:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been seeing a lot about tanks and balancing on the sub for a while now so I'd throw my own 2 cents in. The reason tanks were supposedly nerfed in killing power against eachother and infantry is because they're so readily available for everyone all the time. This is inpart something you can blame on the ressource system where everyone has infinite ressources and only have to wait a few minutes to afford a new MBT. Back when the game first came out, not only were the ressources fairly limited depending on how much territory you had. But there were also timers to prevent chainpulling. This meant that vehicles were very powerful, but if you took one out of commission that meant that player would not be back with it for quite a while. Obviously the removal of the timers happened and the ressources got based at a flat 50/75 per minute and not based on territory gain. Suddenly there were now hugely powerful vehicles that everyone could chainpull all the time, so people began ripping at either buffing infantry vehicle killing power or nerfing the vehicles. My proposal for a change is to readd the timers, back in the day it was something you could buy certs into to lessen the timer but just give it a flat like 10-15 minutes. If you hadn't certed it back in the day it was 20 minutes before you could pull again. This also means that tanks should be buffed again to be seriously dangerous to one another but also infantry, since infantry seems way to able to counter armor with c4, rocklets, archers, max units, tank mines and plain old rockets and it wouldn't be fun to wait 15 mins cuz you got instagibbed by a single infantry man with c4 costing 1/3 of the tanks cost. Edit: making maxes have a timer again might also be a better choice than increasing their cost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, I've been using WE's M1A1 GBBR thompson for about 9 months now for skirmishing. And I've noticed over the last month or so that it seems to not wanna fire semi auto consistently, many of our gamemodes are semi only you see.  #8203; Essentially I'll move the switch onto semi auto, but every so often it will fire a burst of 3-5 rounds on a single trigger pull.  #8203; I've opened it up several times to look at what seems to be wrong, my only suspect seems to be the trigger mechanism being slowly eroded from the bolt during firing.  #8203; Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to fix it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're trying to get something out of the game that isn't meant to be there. It's simulating a constant never ending sandbox future war with hundreds of people across vast distances. There is no balance in how many vehicles you or your enemy can throw at eachother nor is there a match making system. Planetside 2 is a game of counters and knowing when to use said counters is part of the skill.  #8203; The amount of times I see A2G nosegun ESFs dominate medium sized fights because no one on my team besides me is smart enough to pull AA boggles the mind. Same if you're being shelled by tanks from a distance, pull back to the previous base. Pull a tank of your own and go flank the bastards.  #8203; Also- Squads and outfits. Have some reliable teammates with you so that you don't get farmed as much because you'll have people you can trust to cover your back and help you get rid of said instagib situations. Getting randomly bolted or HESHed through a doorway on a pointhold hurts a little less when you've been brought back up by a squad medic within 2 seconds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who practically mains combat engineer since ASP, having a shotgun secondary is only useful if you know to pull it out before hand. If you get caught reloading your primary (or the shotgun) then you will in most situations be fucked because you can't just whip out a side arm in a quick defense.  #8203; It's a sidegrade alternative more than anything.

    <TEXT>"This war of mine" Is a game that does something similar, it's a 2d survival game where you are playing as a group of civilians in a besieged city. During the day you clean up the broken house you now call home, build beds and cook food while preparing for the future with things like traps to catch small animals etc. At night you go out to scavenge, in the start you'll get nice easy abandoned homes to loot for food and resources. But those dwindle fast, soon you'll have to make a call about if you should steal from some defenseless people or from more unsavory types like rebels, soldiers or criminals and risk dying. Or even murdering someone to get away safely, which can have severe impacts on your survivors mental health. Overall it's a helluva depressing experience but an important one to give perspective. This game is based on the Siege of Sarajevo which was the longest siege in modern military history (almost 5 years).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had an incredibly similar moment, not with bayonet though. I had pushed across the road ahead of my squad to scout out the German positions, slowly crawling through the bush with my Garand ready. One guy appears, bang. I shoot him dead. Suddenly 2 of his comrades appear, bang bang. Dead. A grenade gets thrown at me, I manage to get away in time and throw one back. I fire my gun into the forest then reload, when I peak again. 3 more come running towards me and I drop them with a couple shots and narrowly avoid being hit myself. I decide to sod it and get out of this damn forest when I stumble onto an MG gunner and an AT guy who had been laying less than 25 meters to my left, I panic dump my Garand into them and then finally lay down in proper cover with my squad. This entire series of events took around 45-60 seconds and my heart rate was through the fucking roof.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm probably not the correct audience for this type of videos as I'm more a "highlights and memes" kinda guy when it comes to gameplay videos. But I'll list off the things I did like: Your voice, excellent voice and good mic quality. Your narration of what is going on is helpful to people who don't play the game (I assume) It's nice to see you don't edit out your deaths to appear better at the game, something about people who do that irks me wrong. The entire sniping segment was really good. Again, throughout I was kinda bored but I won't fault you for that as it's just not the type of content I watch. But keep up the good work either way!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>god damn that sounds bad, the worst experience I've had has only been bad squadleaders ranging from "new" which is excuseable to downright assholes. Altho I will say that sometimes as infantry people need to relax around squadleaders. I had a guy last night constantly yell what we should do tactics wise, would yell the positioning of units and tanks like 4-6 times even after I said "copy" and began placing markers. It's a lot to balance when you gotta ensure there is spawn options, avoid getting shot, shooting back at the eneny, talking to command and other SLs, placing markers, calling out things for your squad members to do AND having this one asshole yell in my ear constantly. Moral of the story: Don't backseat squadlead and don't be a dick to SLs, there is a lot more going on for them than everyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm perfectly fine with this not being in the game, the scopes aren't as high magnification in PS. They're like 3x at most meaning you can still shoot people really close. It's also a matter of balancing, because having a scope in a game where only 1 class per squad get a scope and everyone else has iron sights is mad powerful in the right hands. Granted that's why as an SL I despise marksman players and wish they'd pick something more team oriented like an LMG or AT because they always insist on running fucking miles away to sit away from the squad and snipe without any care to what's going on around them. The marksman should be with the squad, maybe a little off to the flank or behind the squad in a building so he can cover. That way he can call out enemies, take down high value targets like machine gunners or other marksmen. But no, most of them just sit on the opposit side of the fucking map doing their own thing and often don't say a word the entire match. Or they're one of those people who'll whine in the VC "gimme marksman, gimme marksman" until they're kicked or get their wish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny story about the PanzerSchreck, it was originally not designed with the shield in mind. Due to it being a big beefy 88mm rocket. Fuel from the rocket was still being expended after it left the tube, so the operator would have to wear protective clothing on their face, body and hands to avoid being burnt to a crisp. Naturally as a soldier, running around in gear like that sucked. So either you'd run around and probably die from exhaustion and low visibility, or you'd die to a tank because you were too slow to get your gear on to safely fire the dedicated anti tank weapon. The troops in the field came up with the idea for the iconic shield we see on it, which was taken notice of and shields were manufactured and shipped out to the troops to then attach to it. This is what happens when you don't test things properly before shipping it into battle, another thing which is very different between Germany and the allies. The allies scrapped so many projects because they didn't hold up, where as the Germans just shipped that shit out regardless of how good it was. \*cough cough\* FERDINAND</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The anti tank rifles are not meant to outright destroy the tanks, you're supposed to shoot through the weak spots to kill the crew members inside. Shoot at the view ports and if your shot goes through the armour. You'll generally kill the person you were aiming at. The safest approach to this is to disable the gun first, that can be done from close range either behind or from the sides of the tank. You'll be able to tell when you've pierced the tank by the obvious holes that are in the armour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He does have some good sources that he credits, youtube channels are the most common way people digest history because not everyone are able to get through full lectures or understand the language. Because most people only have a hobby level interest in it. And I do stand by my statement that the Axis couldn't have won. Simply from a logistical and resource standpoint. They dealt themselves a bad hand and played it poorly. The whole reason I referred you to the video's is because it's easier than explaining everything in a reddit comment. But I'd like to see you craft a realistic alternative timeline where the Axis win and how they manage to overcome their incredibly stacked odds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unlikely, because Churchill was massively against peace with Hitler. Even during the Dunkirk crisis. And even if peace with the UK had been achieved, eventually due to oil shortages and ideological desire they would have kicked the hornets nest that is the soviet union. And if they didn't, the soviet union would have attacked them once they were ready. And Germany would have still had it's skull caved in, except in this scenario, the USSR would overrun all of Europe and not just the east.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is nothing saying the US wouldn't still have shipped materiel to the soviets even if the UK was not in the war. The soviet union is such a large country that can trade casualties and land at a rate higher than any European power. Not to mention the entire German invasion was planned to only last 6 months, meaning they only prepared supplies and logistics for that amount of time. Meaning their advance was a constant start-stop motion which gave the USSR plenty of time to dig in. Also, the russians did lose moscow to napeoleon. But they burnt it down so that the french army didn't have a place to be for the winter, that is the kind of will to fight that the russian people have in their wars. Especially those that are on their own turf. Remember that Barbarossa was a war of extermination, Hitler had in many speeches and his book laid out that he wanted to exterminate the soviet people and replace them with germans, so the soviets knew this was a literal war of survival and would have fought to the last man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but those historians also use sources and citations, so their interpretation can also be completely skewed from reality. Like the book "death traps" is.

    <TEXT>While I have Aurax'd the normal version, it was a long time ago and I didn't really remember it. But doing this one really made me remember what a frustrating ass shit gun it is. I honestly rather be using the pre-buff Arbalest than this. The long delay before firing means you have to anticipate when someone comes around the corner, and if you don't score those 4 headshots then you'll die to any decent player, since you have to wait for a second burst. Mid range? Also shit, because of it's charge up it's incredibly difficult to track people and you often miss kill oppertunities because they manage to get to cover before a second burst is fired. The only real success I had with it was during corridors, I'd just sit there and spam fire into a crowd at head level and they'd drop like flies. But literally any gun can do that AND also be good for run and gun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imo the way they designed the aircraft was wrong. The ESF's should have been A2A alone. No A2G noseguns or missile secondaries. The ESF's job is to hunt bigger game that can do A2G, mainly Liberators and Galaxies. The Liberator should be the primary A2G vehicle, with a limited defence against ESF's that require it to have an escort to avoid being shot down. Galaxy transports are in a pretty decent spot, but I think that their repair ability on each other should be lowered so we don't get these Sunderer train moments but in the air.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because most of the nations they took over were weaker than Germany, France and England had a bunch of major fuck ups and "last war" syndrome. Not to mention a healthy dose of luck ontop of it.

    <TEXT>The Tiger models actually do make sense in regard to Germany's oil and manpower shortages. While being on the defensive too. Making more Panzer 4's isn't gonna help if you don't have the fuel run them or men to crew them. So making heavier tanks have a reasoning. Granted, making small upgrades to them all the time even during mid production was a colossal mistake that plagued them from start to finish of the war.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A great example of this is the Panzershreck, people always praise it for it's 88mm lethal anti tank ability. But fail to factor in that the US were the first to field a bazooka. The Germans got inspired by that design but wanted it to be bigger. Problem with it was that bigger rocket meant there was still fuel leaving the rocket as it left the barrel, which would seriously injure or even kill the user if they didn't wear protective equipment. Which running around in during combat is a bitch, or if you have to rapidly put it on as that tank turret is slowly turning towards you is not ideal. That iconic shield we always see it has, was actually a field mock up the troops made to make the Panzershreck actually useful in combat. So they quickly noticed that and began mass producing these shields so they could be fitted onto existing Panzershrecks already in the field.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have to remember that- everything regarding the Eastern front was made with 2 primary things in mind.  #8203; 1. Oil. Germany was running low on fuel 1941 and onward and Hitler knew it, this is why he was so desperate to make the drive away from Moscow to help army group south reach those oil fields. 2. The entire campaign in the east was designed around the French model. Take the capital and they'd surrender, they planned this with only 6 months of logistics in mind and believed that their racial superiority and their sheer Aryan will would make them win over the subhuman Slavs. You can't find much logic to many of Nazi Germany's decisions during the war because a lot of decisions were built upon a cancerous ideology that believed that the color of their skin alone would bring them the ability to win, regardless of the odds. edit: spelling errors</TEXT>

And imagine feeling pride over your nation declaring war on 4 super powers when you have barely any ressources, a shitty production and logistics network and some terrible decision making at the top. While then also committing one of the worst atrocities in human history. Nazi-Germany fought to the bitter end, but not because of any sanity or good decisions, but because the allies literally levelled Germany to the ground before they realised surrendering was probably a good idea. Had Germany fought on for any longer it would just have been the first to get nuked due to the Germany first policy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had one anomaly of an SLing experience during the last free weekend. No one wanted to make a squad on the US side so I decided to start one. Immediately it fills up but only like 3 out of the 8 speak to me. I get them all into an MSP and we decide to flank down and around the objective while the rest of the team engage head on (and getting mostly slaughtered). Through guiding their movement by voice (saying things like "ON ME" and calling out enemy targets, they followed my commands to the letter while being completely dead silent. The medic's revived everyone, even the non-squad ones. They all directed their fire where I told them the enemy was. Our mute AT player even silently (and suicidally) followed me up a line of bushes thowards an enemy Panzer IV while the rest of the squad drew it's fire behind a small hill. The AT got 2 direct hits on it, the crew panick'd and hopped out to repair and I gunned them down with the Thompson. In the end we won the match, my squad managed to get most kills of the team and second most revives. I was really proud of everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem with the NPE in planetside is that, they can put in as many tutorials and as many handguards and safety lines as possible. But besides linking people to the best tutorials on YT and encouraging to shop around for an active outfit is honestly all I can see RPG being able to do. Planetside requires effort to learn, time to become good at it and acceptance that no matter how good you think you were in other shooters. You'll get curb stomped for a time until you figure things out. The best thing that can be done is that us players pick up the mantle and fetch those poor newbies who run from warpgate to frontline, or who just kind of sit on the point not knowing what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shotguns are extremely nich #233;. I remember how frustrated I was playing with them when I was doing the directive to completion. Because planetsides combat is so fluid in engagement ranges and situations, a shotgun is actually a disadvantage in most situations. Even if someone is further away than 5 meters, you risk not putting out enough damage in time to kill them. Especially if it's a pump and your target is a heavy assault. HOWEVER. Since ASP became a thing, I've committed to a full on combat engineer loadout- having a shotgun as a backup weapon is extremely powerful when paired with a carbine. At the moment I've switched pack to a pistol since I've got a bunch of side arms I need to aurax- but if the situation is very tense and a point needs clearing. I'm grabbing old trusty ragetell causer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's less about engineering than doctrine. The Germans at the time realized that under a 2 front war they'd have to beat the shit out of Russia and just keep the western allies at bay for long enough for them to do so. Hence their trench networks were 100% defensive, meaning they could go all out in the concrete. Permanent facilities and other amenities that made life much easier. The allied trenches however- were always meant as a stop gap. A place to build up forces to attack the enemy line and was never meant to be a permanent solution. Hence why they were so famously awful places to be in. Not to mention that their area was in more low ground so that once they dug deep they'd hit water and turn their entire lines into a mud nightmare that'd eat the feet of the poor sods forced to live in it.</TEXT>

But if you took everything away from them- they wouldn't build you a new car from scratch if they weren't given the parts and tools to do so. Just imagine the logistics and knowledge required in building something as common as a car if you have to start from scratch, or even in the mechanicus case. A bunch of old scraps of data from an era 10 thousand years past of constant war of things getting lost, rediscovered, corrupted, destroyed etc. Now apply that same logic to something even more complicated like a plasma reactor, a main battle tank, a titan war machine and a battleship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're correct about the binary point. Last night on Cobalt- ArcP, TTRO, TRXF, RSG1 and 95SS all grouped up air to take down the 2 enemy bastions and protect our own one. They died rather quickly because they were undefended- immediately after, VS and NC pulled more bastions. Which we then also took down. That's 4 bastions destroyed in 32 minutes due to lack of defenders. We had maybe around 2 platoons worth of aircraft on a prime time friday. If the enemy had co-ordinated they could have maybe done the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's mainly about how vehicles interact with infantry that sucks. If you make infantry too strong- you get shit like rocklet rifle LA's. Or if you don't make the base design proper, the tanks will be spamming HESH from a hill into the base and kill random infantry or through doorways. (Looking at you Esamir you dumpsterfire of a continent) Typically vehicles would have enough on their hands if enemies actually attacked sunderes beyond one stray tank or light assault, but as someone who's done both I can say being on foot in the base is way more entertaining. But I also see it as a flaw in how we the playerbase treats the game. I don't agree with the philosophy that you should be able to stick to 1 playstyle only and do everything, a vehicle player should take the choice of either stay outside a base and guard the sundy or leave his tank to go fight in the base. Same in the opposite way, if there is a tank zerg spamming hesh on you and you bitch as infantry, you should stop. Redeploy, grab some tanks yourself and go kill them. I often go out of my way to grab an AP lighting just to get rid of hesh farmers or aircraft (AP best AA). I used to just do nothing back in the day but drive around in my Prowler, I logged in and only did that. But things got pretty boring so when I switched it up with air and infantry and began doing all 3 things as the situation required of me. I became a lot happier with the game. Obviously if you only wanna do 1 thing ever in the game and become the god of that playstyle, sure thing it's what you wanna do. But the game shouldn't be radically changed just because your playstyle might not fit into all situations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe vehicles are just not supposed to interact in a base attack? Their job is to dominate the field, smash away any resistance and secure the spawn locations for the infantry. Now I wouldn't object to there being more vehicle bases, or if more bases had vehicle points for them to capture and defend. But I don't think that tanks should be able to sit and shell into an enclosed space that is meant for the infantry to fight in. And the infantry shouldn't be the dominant force in an open field fight, once they leave the safety of a structure. A tank should destroy them. I even think they should get a co-axial machine gun because dealing with LA rocklet rifles is honestly one of the most frustrating things I experience in tank. This is what I was getting at with what I saying "one playstyle shouldn't dominate all aspects of the game"- But it seems to differ from yours since you are a vehicle main. Where as I do tanks, air and infantry as the situation requires of me. I'll pull tanks to fight from base to base and other tanks, I'll pull air to shoot down A2G farmers or provide air support for my squad, and I'll run on the point and shoot planetmen if that is where I'm needed most. This way it becomes a combined arms game for me, with each playstyle having a specific role to fill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah thanks for doing the explanation cuz I couldn't actually be bothered to figure it out myself. But the reason I shot where I did, is that I remember from driving the jadgpanzer in my war thunder days. Is that the ammo rack is located on the angled armour along the sides. I didn't expect it to kill in 1 shot though because every tank battle I've had so far in PS has been a clusterfuck of shots bouncing and panic'd driving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every time my outfit spots a bastion on the continent that's messing with our ground battles. We immediately seek out to destroy it- we're not that many, usually 12-20ish people outside of ops days and I've found that the vast majority of Bastions do not have a good escort. Many of them don't even have all the guns manned- so our small airwing have no trouble taking them down. And most of us are by no means amazing pilots. But you don't need to be an amazing pilot to lock onto a hardpoint with missiles and then dodge until next volley. So far our Bastion killcount is 32 since Escalation came out. I can see that if you're a solo-player only that it will be frustrating for you. But... This game was never really meant to be played alone. Sure you can do it, I myself solo'd around for 3 years just doing directives. But it means giving up on certain perks you get from having a reliable squad of outfit mates to have your back.</TEXT>

A drop in player numbers was 100% expected and the sharp increase from Escalation was purely luck from RPG's side with how the world situation is. But what will keep players consistently engaged and coming back is updates like this. It's only been 3 months and an update like the colossus one would have been "the huge yearly update" and then nothing, had it come out in 2019.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Remove the weight system entirely from assets</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-28 10:33:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/hf0dbt/remove_weight_from_facility_modules/) a few days ago- and after thinking more about it while looking through the things we can build and when I'd possibly use them. It makes no sense to have the weight system for the majority of the items in there.  #8203; The reason we see so few ANVILS, Facility modules and other of the more nich #233; items in the game is because of the weight system. Most of these items are highly situational, and they take time to craft ontop of it- but no one is gonna let ANVILs and Facility modules take up valuable space for those rare situations where they are gonna apply them. We've already got several roadblocks with the asset system. Ressource collection time, Asset production time and how many we can have in storage ready to use. If they just tune the amount we can have at a time, like they did with orbital strikes. But remove the weight system- everything else would get way more use out of it. If the Bastion carrier parts had weight to them aswell as the finished Bastion- very few outfits would spend the time building one because it'd just take up more valuable space for Citadel shields, Orbitals and Steel rain. The 3 most useful in the arsenal. So why not do the same for everything else? Reduce the facility modules amount to 5, Citadel shields to 2, Steel rains to 3, Colossus tanks to 2, ANVIL lights to 12, ANVIL mediums to 6, and ANVIL heavies to 3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don't need a weight system because we've already got a maximum amount system. The weight system just makes it so that everything else but orbitals, citadel shields and steel rain doesn't get used. Our outfits standard line up is 2 orbitals, 2 citadel shields and 1 Steel rain. These are the most useful that we might need to call on right now. But no one is gonna wait 5 minutes to build a facility module for slightly cheaper vehicles- and they're not gonna have them sit around in storage because 5 weight for something that situational is not worth it.  #8203; Removing the weight system and tuning the amount of each thing we can have would make the whole war asset system more used instead of just those 3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason it makes zero sense is because of the overwhelming retardation that is Nazi ideology. They modeled the USSR campaign on the French one because they believed that despite the size and manpower despairity- that the slavs were so inferior that they'd just give up and flee. Hence why they only logistically planned for a 6 month campaign, and not preparing for things like wider soviet railways, dust killing up to 50% of engines in some panzer groups due to the Soviet terrain and the fact that the majority of the army where still on foot or horseback like its fucking 1810. Even had they taken Moscow or the Caucuses oil fields it wouldn't have helped in the end result. It was a war of extermination and the Soviets knew it. So they'd fight to the last man, woman and child rather than surrender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah- they often overshadow that fact with the even larger amounts of Soviet casualties. But the Soviets suffered around 800 thousand dead by the end of 41- and around 3.3 million captured soldiers from encirclements. Which means that the Germans actually had more dead than the Soviets did by the end of 1941. And then you gotta factor in the fact that losing that amount for the Germans are men and material they cannot afford to lose. Where as the Soviets could more than make up for those losses- to the extent that German high command were confused why there was still resistance when by their own assumptions they had destroyed the Red army multiple times over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I understood in the main story and exploring relics and talking to all the races. Spoiler for the main quest  gt;!Since the entire Galaxy is a simulation by the Atlas- and the Atlas being close to death. It began acting erradically and deployed the Sentinels as a security force into the Euclid galaxy. The Vy'keen fought them off over hundreds of years in the edges of the galaxy- It resulted in a Vy'keen victory and the sentinels retreated out of the galaxy to bide their time. But this had left the Vy'keen weakened and vulnerable. ! lt;
      gt;!This is when the Empire of the first spawn attacked the weakened Vy'keen. Ceasing their territories and becoming the sole dominant power of the Galaxy. But around the same time, the Korvax began their revolution by sacrificing a large amount of themselves as nanites into the Gek spawning pools. ! lt;
      gt;!During this civil war, the Sentinels struck back harder than ever to secure the Galaxy. They drove deep into the Empire, dismanteling cities and most traces of civilization as they reached the core of the Galaxy and the Gek homeworld. ! lt;
      gt;!Which brings us to the time the game takes place in. There is now a Sentinel precense on every planet and only sparse outposts, space stations and small hubs are allowed to exist anymore. The Korvax worship the Sentinels as gods, The Vy'keen hate them deeply but there is no organised resistance anymore. ! lt;  However I'd love an overhaul to how factions work. With actual territories carved up between them, frontlines that might move back and forth as wars are declared and ended. And to top it off- we should be allowed to join one of them to fight for their cause. Or be allowed to start our own player made factions and empires. I'd love to see groups of players be able to clean a planet of a Sentinel precense and re-establish civilization and take control of their own areas of space. This could eventually spark some player vs player warfare. Which would also mean we need an overhaul to frigate/Freighter warfare in space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I reckon they send you on missions to kill them and steal their stuff is merely just small vengeance operations rather than the desire for full scale war. Right now the Sentinels are actually rather passive in their behavior. Starships, Frigates, Space stations and Freighters still get built. As do outposts and mining operations across the Galaxy. So there must be some way the 3 races have figured out how to have these very high tech large scale things without established planet based empires with large populations. Yet if you mine a rock infront of a Sentinel it'll lose it's shit.</TEXT>
