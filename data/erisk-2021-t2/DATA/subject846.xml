    <TEXT>Hi folks I #8217;m curious about germination? More specifically spring onion and cauliflower. I understand some seeds need light to germinate and some need dark. What is good for spring onion/cauliflower? And the temperature? Could it be dark and still cold (if dark is required I #8217;d need to take them out of the green house and put them under the bbq for instance, and it gets cold at night) or does it always need to be warm?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gotta be honest, I really enjoyed this movie. I Hear that that #8217;s not a widely held opinion and the movie is generally an unpopular-one. Maybe my opinion isn #8217;t a great one, after all I do enjoy some of Costner #8217;s other unpopular movies (waterworld, the postman). I found mr brooks so intriguing, such a psychological thriller, with twists and turns, good acting and dialog, and what I thought was an pretty original premise. What are other peoples thoughts? Also, I heard this was gonna be a trilogy. Does anyone have any more information on this?</TEXT>

But, alas, I stopped watching after saw IV. Which I just watched again on Netflix, and I wanted to move on and quench my thirst for blood a little bit more. But, Netflix was playing it in 3D, which totally blows, not only because I despise 3D but because it #8217;s not a 3D tv nor do I have glasses. Was there even a non 3D version? Seriously, the studio would eliminate over half their audience with this dumb decision, why did they do it</TEXT>

I thought I was watching a nice fantasy, and then my life was ripped out of me. I read this was meant to teach kids about death!? That went over my head with the emotions being dialed up to 11, I was biting my lip trying not to let them pour out of me. Could kids not be taught with something a little less brutal. Jess is going to blame hisself for years for Leslie #8217;s death, and maybe he should. As someone who blame himself for a friends death I think this will haunt me for quite a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I enjoyed this in season 1, some odd scenes and questionable writing but it was very good. And then there was season 2, not a great start but I was interested in the story they were telling. Having said that, there was the latter half of the season, which seemed crazily different from the first half, and the second to last episode was diabolical. Who are these people, how did he get here, why is he here, was the plan always to get ride of billy, is that why marisol brought him down to Mexico, why not just off him right away. Why did marisol say she never loved him but was trying to protect him in front of Gabrielle, why was she acting conflicted if she was always sent there to be the corrupt mayor,. Why wasn #8217;t marisol arrested with the testimony of Pete ?? So many questions? Did the writers of season 2hate each other and never communicate about where the season is going? What a waste of Billy Bob Thornton and an interesting premise</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How is this board not more popular? Really, really enjoyed ie. immortal soldiers, it seems like something that #8217;s been done before, but The Old Guard made it feel new. unlike some other fantasy movies it wasn #8217;t ott, and didn #8217;t try to make everything that was going on  #8216;other worldly #8217;, throwing in jokes and sarcastic little quips along the way. Thought the characters were great, people might accuse Andy of being a bit brooding, but she #8217;s been through a lot, joe and nicky were brilliant; be fun to see there adventures in the earlier days, book became a bit of a cunt, but he was good up to that point. Choreography was done very well in my opinion. Like how they were handling guns, (maybe someone else thinks better) The one scene that comes to mind was when Nile kills her first guard and she checks the gun with one hand pulling back the slide, like the scene in John Wick. Cool music too Unfortunately, it has a pretty low score on IMDb, I hope that won #8217;t deter from a sequel being made. I think there is an evil immortal group, and they saved quynh, I wanna see how that plays out.</TEXT>
