    <TEXT>This is based on a concept I saw here a little while ago, but could not find the source (so can not credit it). In short you play as The Door, a sentient being whose sole purpose is to find the incompetent protagonist and help them advance to the next level. You would still need to battle enemies and collect any keys/gems required to open yourself to let the protagonist through, but can throw enemies forward and deal with them later too (sort of a commentary of life, that you deal with issues now or they pile up later). While a sidescroller/platformer might be fun, I am instead taking inspiration from 2D top down rouge like games. I've thrown together a [quick little demo](http://aedendalessandro.com.au/games/Door%20Hero/index.html) or what could be achieved, and would like peoples input.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think of a game style or mechanic I haven't done, then build a game around that. My last major prototype was inspired by the fact I'm terrible at music in my games, so I thought I'd make a Tap Tap Revolution style game. Then I thought it'd be more fun to shoot the notes in order to make them play, then it turned into an Avoid the Note game that plays any notes ypu didnt destroy. Even for bigger projects, it's always started with a mecganic and grown from there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Watched the first 5 min, seems fine. Few suggestions : fix the aspect ratio, as it looked stretched to me, get on Twitch if not already and for when the game gets more in depth and you can start doing things like settlement building/customising weapons; dedicate a while video to that, as most people will want to watch game play, not building (though some people do love seeing it too, so good to have the choice). Oh, and at the end of each video, have people vote on how the next part should go, i.e. skip The Minuteman rescue, head for Diamond City, bring companion X with you, use only malee or unarmed, etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Transdev is the worst bus operator in all of Victoria ! The number of complaints I have personally leveled against them in the last year is bordering on 100, and have been to the PTO twice and the Minister for Transport three times. No one seems to want to fix the issues and they all pass the buck saying it's the other guys fault that they can't do their job. I have had three different drivers on the 902 route who have been as rude as one can be without turning physical, skip stops and then berate old ladies when they get off and even just slam breaks on/accelerate before people are properly seated as they find it funny. Worst part, unlike Metro they don't have to hit targets or timing stops with in the -1/+5 time period as they are protected by the FTM and can do as they please without repercussions. Worst company for transport in the whole of Victoria.</TEXT>

So something with a Y of 900 will always overlap something at 800, but if the player is at 850, the order is 900 sprite, player, 800 sprite.

I can't imagine Nintendo saying something like "The new Pok #232;mon game is like SimCity meets Dark Souls, with the physics of Portal 2" at E3. Odds are they would be more inclined to say something like "It's a resource management game, with dark grimy overtone where every opponent you face may very well be your last and you and your team are brutally punished for it. The physics during game play will also allow you to shift entire sections of a room via a anti gravity gun, which will be helpful in solving puzzles in order to get to the final gym."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it's on a weekend you could take a stroll through Queen Vic, hang shit on the weird items and admire the great stands. Maybe grab a cheap keepsake for the one year anniversary (here's hoping). During the week, you could take a drive to the Dandenongs, if you have a car. And if not, you could try [The Standard ](https://www.thestandardhotel.com.au) for an interesting and unique dining experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"You alright ? What's on your mind ?", Frank asks as we stroll down the main street. I stop, and look right at him for a second, before saying "Well, recently I became aware that I have the ability to quicksave before saying something that would prove devistating when talking with others." "Well, that has to be the stupidest thing you've ever said !", said Frank, as he shook his head. "There's no way that can be true." "I swear it is ! Why would I make it up ?", I ask, not expecting an aswer from Frank. "Well, if that is true, and you are quicksaving before saying something that will be devistating; then prove it.", Frank insisted. Rolling my eyes, I say "I've tried proving it, again and again; when I reload though you never remember, because foryou this conversation hasn't happened yet." "So you've tried telling me this before ?", Frank asked, this time with genuine curiousity. "Yeah, and everytime we go through similar conversation loops.", I say with a heavy sigh. "Then prove it. What am I about to say ?", Frank and I say at the same time. "Hey ! How'd you do that ?", we say in unison. "Purple monkey dish washer !", he says, with me trailing just behind. A horrified look washes over his face as the realisation sets in. "You're not lying are you ?", he says, stammering as he does so. "Why would I ?", I ask him, knowng he will not reply with an answer. Thinking for a moment, Frank says "If you know everything, that means there is no free choice as you know the choices people will make. That means that this is just all some elaborate simulation working it's way through a preset sequence." "Now calm down Frank. There's no need to panic. Don't do anything rash !", I say, trying to talk him out of the rash action he's about to take. "I don't want to live in a world like that !", he cries out as he runs into the oncomming traffic. With a screech of brakes, that come too late, followed by shrieks from my friend; I know there's only one thing I can do. **RELOAD** "Huh ? What did you say ?, I ask, staring at Frank. "I ask if everything was alright, and if there was somethin on your mind.", he says. I pause for a moment, considering my response before saying "Yeah, everythings cool. I was just wondering if you might like to go for an ice cream, my shout." "That's probably the smartest thing you've ever said.", he says with a smile. I look at him, sigh, and smile back. Maybe one day I'll be able to tell him, without hm fresking out; as for now, I guess I'll just have to settle with ice cream.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is this a good first laser cutter ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-31 14:38:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>At my work I have access to a pretty decent laser cutter/etcher, that we use for removing the top layer off ColorBond (pre painted steel), use on vinyl and sometimes cutting 3mm (0.118") acrylic. I am wanting one for home, to both play around with and make money from doing small jobs for locals who have voiced interest in name plates, wood toys and even small artistic pieces. The unit I'm looking at is [this one](https://m.ebay.com.au/itm/252306071925) which costs AU$504 (US$360/ #8364;310/  #163;277). Is there any reason I should be looking at something else ? A different type of laser ? Or is this just a nasty unit I will regret buying ? Thanks in advance for any and all advice !</TEXT>

Instead of just a solid block being etched, I was wanting to do greyscale photos. I looked around online, tried a few things and it didn't seem to amount to much, except some very dark etchings.

    <TEXT>"That doesn't sound right.", Jason said, checking the information out for himself. Surely enough though, there on his retinal display showed the fact that not only at one point was the President of the United States a non famous television personality; but prior to 2017 all but one weren't famous for their television or movie roles prior to being President. Still confusedal as to how such a system would have worked, he asked his teacher for more information. "It may be hard to believe Jason, but before President Trump, people would vote on the policies and promises those running for government would make.", said the teacher, smiling as she had explained this foreign concept many times. "What about this Lincoln guy ? It says here he died while at the theatre.", Jason enquired. "He was watching a performance. He was not the one being watched.", replied the teacher. "That's crazy !", came Jason's reply, still unable to believe such things were the norm. "Worry not though, after President Minaj was elected in 2022, after the impeachment of disgraced President Winfrey gave away two thirds of the country during an address at the United Nations; it was decided that only the most famous and relevant would be allowed to run for public office.", explained the teacher. "Oh, you mean the thirty-second amendment ?", Jason guessed, hoping he had been paying enough attention in class that day. "Close, but it was the thirty-first amendment. Guess someone needs some more study.", Jason's teacher said, pointing at the tablet in front of him. "I guess so.", Jason said, sheepishly. Smiling, she left him to study on his own. It was not long however, before one of the other students yelled out for the teachers attention, asking "Miss, what's this about the great dinosaur war of 2033 ?"</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-20 07:00:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So after a 50GB download to play the game (even if you bought it on disc), we now have a 48GB patch ? Not even two weeks into the game, and you need to download the whole thing all over again essentially? There's people here in Australia in rural regions who have yet to even finish download the first file, as their speeds are less than 1MB/sec. I could have sworn they had a BETA to iron out the kinks. The worst part is I genuinely love all of Bethesda's works. I've bought all their games (in some cases multiple times on multiple consoles), but after this; I feel I will just wait six months after any future launches sadly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This story is back when I was in fourth grade. The teacher would repeatedly throw dusters at students, and then demand they fetch them and bring them back to the front. She would also not fact check information before teaching it to us, and just go with what she remembered. On one occassion we were doing a fun run type thing around the schools perimeter (about two kilometre) and when I was the last one around, because so prefered to walk it rather than run it, she told me I had to do it again while the rest of the class went back to learning. In retrospect this could have ended horribly as the perimeter of the school had several drop offs and dirt roads people regularly hoon down. She barely held the position for a year before being moved on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My guess so your mirrors may not be aligned properly. Put a piece of painters tape over the second mirror (X-Axis), and set the laser to 0% power and slowly move up by 1% until you see a mark, then adjust the mirror from the previous one and have it so it is in the centre. Repeat this for your Y-Axis too. Make sure to test at the nearest and furthest points. Aligning the mirrors can improve power output at the head significantly, and reduce any misfires at higher power levels.</TEXT>

I have tried to mitigate the issue by focusing the mirrors over and over, but to no success. What is the chance the tube itself is faulty internally ? * I have cleaned all mirrors, so those would not be an issue. * I have placed tape over the mouth of the laser, and it is definitely making two dots. * After reflecting each mirror, the gap between stays the same. * There is nothing in the tube that I can see, or clean off.

    <TEXT>Yes you can do it quite easily. Red (255,0,0) cuts. Blue (0,0,255) engraved And black through white will etch. So if you have a design, the blacker the fill colour, the deeper it etches. So just pick say 8 values (where the R G B all equal the same value) and use them to get the best result. I recommend 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224, 255.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At any one time the face value of a coin should not be less than 1.5 times the value of the materials required to make it. So a 10c coin for example should cost at maximum 6.67c to make. Otherwise it starts getting to the point where citizens will smelt the coins. This is what happened with the round Australian 50c piece, and promoted the change in metals. While they were at it they made it a dodecahedron too.</TEXT>

Every two weeks I choose a different flair to go with, and try to stay within the lines of said flair. When I eventually get around to the flair that is [MP] I would be able to write something a bit more non-specific, or even meta-physical.  gt;[MP] #160;Miscellaneous Prompt: Any prompt that doesn't fit in the above categories I do though thank you for the suggestions and the examples, as you are dead set that these are a tad specific, but such is the nature of the chosen flair. If you bare with it, come Monday a new flair will be used which may be a bit more exciting.</TEXT>

I went to go check it out, did some tests and checked out. Paid AU$349 for it compared to AU$550 for a new one from Sydney. Unit works great, needs an alignment. What I would say, take a test (cut, etch, raster) file with you, set the power to 10-15% and see how it cuts. Just know when you get it home, you'll need to align the mirrors. If you're happy, I'd say pay half the price of a brand new unit, no more than that.</TEXT>
