    <TEXT>Nice review mate, Talisker 15 (2019 special release) was my first bottle over  #163;100, because my first ever scotch experience was with Talisker when I visited their distillery in Skye a few years ago, they've always had a special place in my heart, I love Talisker 15 mainly because I get a complete flavour explosion from it that not many whiskey's deliver for me, I know it can be more intense and potent being cask strength which makes them more stronger than other whiskey but that's something I've always been into</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I very recently brought a Curly Haired Juvenile tarantula that is housed in a plastic terrarium in my room, I have a wall exterior mounted heat mat but my tarantula has been right on it all night, and the mat can't seem to get the air temperature in the terrarium over 20 #176;c and it's been on all this time, I'm worried about him, what should I do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wish I heard all that in the research I've done on tarantulas for beginners, I put the heat mat on the exterior wall just like the set up video for the set i brought, that was to creates a hot and a cool zone in the terrarium, it's not my house mate and I was never told that getting a tarantula involves wacking up the heating bill in my parents house, surley getting a thermostat for the heat mat would help maintain a safe temperature?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah Im not great with money so I probably shouldn't of brought it but in comparison to what some people spend on alcohol in one night that  #163;112 lasts alot longer and is much more enjoyable, well in my opinion. ah nice, I love T10, my first bottle of Scotch and probably my favorite is Talisker storm with dark storm close after it, it's a 2019 special limited release I think mate</TEXT>
