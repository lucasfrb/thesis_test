    <TITLE>WIBTA if I didn't want to go on holiday with my family?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-21 12:27:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone. This is an issue that I am having a really hard time deciding on, hope you can help me clear it up. I am studying in my senior year of high school and my family want to go on holiday this Christmas to spend some time together. My brother is boarding overseas and my parents feel that this will be a chance for us to spend time together before I leave home for college. However, I don't really want to go for a couple reasons. Firstly, this will be one of the last opportunities I have to spend with my friends and girlfriend here, and I'm not sure if I will keep in touch or see many of these people again. I feel that my family has plenty of opportunity to spend time together because my brother comes home regularly for holidays and it's not like I will be leaving home forever once I go to university. I also feel that it's not necessary for us to go off to a foreign country to spend time together, and we could just spend time together enjoying Christmas and the new year as a family at home. I feel that if we were to leave I would miss out on one of my last opportunities to spend time with my friends and girlfriend. I have been thinking about whether or not I should confront my parents about this because they have to book the trip pretty soon and once it's done I will have to go for sure. WIBTA if I told them I don't want to go on a long trip at Christmas?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not like the Hong Kong protesters are completely innocent either. I'm not supporting the horrific actions by the government and police but at some points the actions of the protesters were shocking. I find that a lot of media paints them as innocent and peaceful and I just want to note that both sides have committed some pretty brutal and violent acts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair it wasn't a Chinese directive to make the extradition bill, or the Chinese government who are currently beating and hurting us. It's mostly an issue within the Hong Kong government and their inability to communicate with the protesters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's also an issue that the Chinese government won't let Carrie lam approve all 5 of the main requests. Understandably the independent inquiry for the police brutality is necessary and should be approved, but other things such as amnesty for protesters and the definition of rioters in the press cannot be approved by the government. I personally believe that the protesters who truly are violent and riot (like the ones who beat Chinese reporters at the airport) should not be given amnesty for their actions, and should serve jail time for what they did.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is fair, but I also believe that Carrie lam is probably unable to withdraw the bill fully. The Chinese government would never allow her to do so because that would be an act of weakness which they cannot afford to show right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well depends on the context here. In Hong Kong we have 2 main groups that are fighting for our freedoms against the government, one is peaceful and one is really extremist. This guy is part of the latter group, and they are really violent and aggressive and even beat civilians if they have different ideologies from them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that it is possible but both sides need to stop acting out in violence. One thing I have noticed is that while the police often act violently and attack protesters, it is usually both sides that are using violence. I am a very strong advocate for peaceful protest because I feel like the current movement is far too violent towards anyone who opposes them. I believe that if the protesters use peaceful and respectful means to voice their issues, then de-escalation will help solve the issue. Right now we have the police beating protesters, but we also have protesters who beat anyone who doesn't agree with them, even old people and women. They also have doxxed many people who don't agree with them and mobbed their workplaces. In my opinion this makes them just as bad as the communist party police because they only want freedom for those who agree with them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think it is an issue of the mainland which is contrary to the agenda that a lot of media pushes. The mainland doesn't really have a stake in this issue, and has actually been taking steps to help dissolve the conflict. Right now, I think that the issue lies with the violent protesters, who I feel are wrong. Not all protesters are violent and many actually find peaceful ways to demonstrate, but the radical ones are out of control and continue to push this level of violence. They are on par with terrorists at this point because not only do they attack police and the government, but they also attack the civilians and citizens of Hong Kong. I believe that if they de-escalate the violence and everyone compromises and works together then this issue can be solved.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To a certain extent I believe that it did have an effect. The bill was suspended after 2 million of us took to the streets. I'd like to think that the results came because of the mass protests that makes me proud of Hong Kong. I don't believe that acting like terrorists can achieve the results that Hong Kong wants. And even if it does, the cost of compromising our own values and becoming like the CCP police isn't worth it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Old NDS Card Battle Game</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-19 08:23:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently remember playing this game but I can't seem to remember what it was and I really want to try find it again. Platform(s): I remember playing this game on the NDS. Genre: Card battle/RPG. Estimated year of release: Unknown but I played it on the first NDS about 8-9 years ago. Graphics/art style: Remember it was a 3D graphic game and it involved a lot of animations where the character would summon things to fight for it through cards. Notable characters: I believe you played as some kind of small yellow chicken. Notable game mechanics: You would walk around like a kind of rpg and go through different levels but combat was based on summoning cards to fight for you. Other Details: Remember that there was a level in a kind of cave sort of place, and one in an underwater temple looking area.  #8203; Hopefully someone knows what it is and can help me find it agian.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-08 03:58:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Geralt and Sekiro run into each other and decide to fight to see who's the better swordsman. Round 1: Geralt has no potions or signs, Sekiro can't use any prosthetics or combat arts, both are just relying on their skills with the sword alone. Round 2: Geralt can use potions before the fight, Sekiro has access to all his prosthetic tools. Round 3: Geralt has all his signs and potions, Sekiro can use all prosthetics and combat arts. Who would come out as the better fighter in the end?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was thinking that in round one sekiro may have the edge because he's used to fighting people who are a lot stronger than him and generally seems to be a bit better with the sword than geralt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You need level three if you want to trade well with other people. Against strong early champs like talon and champs that have better range than you level 3 is generally when you can try for short burst trades with grass element. When you're level 6 you can use ice and ult to kill most squishy mage champions from almost full health.</TEXT>
