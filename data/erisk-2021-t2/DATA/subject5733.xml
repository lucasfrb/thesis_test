But Nyph left roster for sure Gamers 2 - Hybrid Follow eSports - Nisbeth So in the end "Sherlock" assumed its probably will be Elements or Roccats. Dont think somebody from NA wonna sign in Eddy.

Still not all speculations. 3d post on his twitter acc about being part of a tournament http://en.vega-squadron.com/news/vegalol-will-take-part-starladder-i-league-invitational . 2 teams from CIS, 1 Turkey, 1 Japan.

Empire CIS? They actually looked strong in CIS playoffs. So mb they can at least fight for wildcard spot to the IWCI for Worlds 2016. But summer LCL split will be rly strong with NA'VI, Hard Random, GMB CIS and Empire as main contenders for wildcard spot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am jgl main since season 4. Why i am playin jgl? Cause of playmaking potential. My second best role is support. Do you know why? 1st of all cause of same reason as Jgler. Supports have huge impact in current meta despite some ppl cant understand that. Even with meta changed to supports like Zyra, Karma, Brand, Bard, which more about poke and be agressive in lane fase. Still supports can roam, can deep warding during the early game, have good engage potential + they have less pressure on their shoulders. All this leadue to easy climb up for good supports. The problem for me to not pick support as my secondary role cause of dynamic Q problem. I will probably get support 80/20 jgl, so i am pickin any other role despite imma bad on top, mid, or adc. If Riot will change it to better way, i'll start to pick support as my second role (in case if it will be like 70 jgl/30 sup). Otherwise i wont, cause still jgler have a best impact in game from 1 to 20 minutes, and can easly direct team to win pre 25 minutes. Sry for my bad eng, imma not a native speaker. But i wanted to explain my point about how good supports right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The big problem of bronze or silver or even gold. Players on that elo mostly cant snowball from good early lanin fase. On my experience when i smurfed my second acc on west from bronze to gold, i noticed that. For example: imma pickin nidalee, gragas, lee sin in jgl who have big early game impact. But enemy jgler pick up shyvana or mas #1077; #1091; #1082; yi or some sh*t farm late game jgler. So in 50% of this games i lost it even i snowballed my team. Cause ppl most time cant apply won lane to win the game. Anythin can happen on this elo. And ppl on this elo struggle in game alot. So my point is here is my picks for u: 1)Zyra - good agressive lane fase, good CC, good Siege potential, good Scaling into the late game. 2)Blitz - can be rly good on lane fase as can be rly useless on it. Good at roams. Always relevant on low elo with magic grabs. Can def the carry well enough. 3)Karma - good agressive lane fase. Good buff for team teamfights. But rly bad if team behind. 4)Brand - good agressive lane fase. Good in teamfights and siege. Have a good scalin despite was nerfed recently. 5)Nami - true support here. Comfortabale safe lane fase, good CC, good team fight potential , good buff for carry in your team. Here is my top for u mate. If u have any questions feel free to ask me. I'll help as much as i can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, ma bad. My thought was directed not to wave clear. Just for carry and playmaker potential. Wonna say somethin abaout Bard. He can be GOD tier like Champs i called earlier, but u need to be the master of Bard, cause 1 ulti can be gamechange in both way to lose or win the game. So Bard is kinda quastionable pick on low elo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cmon dude dont need to be hursh to someone who lost the lane. Yeap its rly hard when u lost the lane especially after last patch which give u for 1st turret 600+ golds if u won lane and got it. But for example - i played yesterday top lane GP vs Trundle and i was sitted by enemy jgler j4. Even imma new on top lane and just tranin it i asked my jgler not to help me. Cause 1st of all imma try to test my limites on GP, 2nd i was better at farmin (+40 minions) even with 6 death on me on 20 minutes, 3d Imma still will be usefull in teamfights with barrels blows and ulti. So i asked Noct to pressure mid and bot lane and i'll be ok even with what i have now. BTW in the end of the game when we WON, trundle told me: as i was carried by my team. ahahahah. How he was wrong after he watched my KP% which was more then our jgler had+ my damage was top in the game from all players. So i carried this game. Just... bro sometimes u should belive in your teamates, like did mine, cause with season 4-5-6 startin in its more about teamwork, not about personal skill.

    <TEXT>What for? NA already showed us as they have a tons of money, and despide that, through years they still dont manage to go to even semis. And NA Worlds showed us as NA funs mostly gar****(i mean garlick) with negative attitude. Especially with them cheering TSM when every team was presented, or when they Booed SSG. Or in reddit when they shit on EU preworlds and hyped up TSM as most best Western team league could ever see. But we saw what happend in the end. They just crying like a babies and and excuses like a babies. And talking how Eu is got lucky with draft and ect. Mmm NA RIOT isnt better then NA fans. They singlehandly trying to promote NA region. They mostly dont care about other regions. NA LCS lets do Bo3 it will be more good and test less profit format on EU lcs. Or lets eleminates sisters team in Korea, cause it not "fair". But let sister team in NA CS earn a free 1.000.000 $. Who give a shit we are the kings of this game? Isnt you are thinkin like that? Why should i respect Na, or Na rito? Norhing for.</TEXT>

Cause as i told u early half of that is only true. When u good on champion u like and u have the same opponent but on meta pick, with the same lvl of play, despide whatever elo, he will outscale you early or later. Just cause his pick have more impact at this moment, at this patch in game. This is a half. As the other half. Dude its f***in low elo, play wutever u want, just get a pool at least of 2-3 champs on first or secondary role, and with good mental strange, good game knowlage and good own skill, you will climb for sure.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Trying Tryndamere. Build pathing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-19 18:46:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>1st of all sry for my Eng. Then go to topic. Imma tryin to main Trynda and here i have 1 main question. So from all otp or high elo players we have 2 main path of Trynda build: 1st build Tiamat  gt; PD 2nd build Botrk  gt; Static or Static gt; Botrk depend of situtation (sustain or trade, whatever you need more) So here the question why and where i should build 1st one and 2nd one build. Cause its looks like they both about wave clear. Just can assume that 2nd build is more about trading your opponents. Then i have another question against which champ is better to build this path. I can do it intuitive but still better have understanding. I mean i can udenrstand when i need to go 3d item IE or BC or ect and with next 1 items. But still i cant answer where is better to go with 1st build and where with 2nd, cause they both trully damage and wont help u in anythin else. Like i played rene against rumbe and i would lose lane as renek i just rush Spirit visage instead of rushin black cleaver but here is much difficult to detect why and where. Thx for reading this post guys, and 1 more question pls link me some good OTP Trynda Youtube channels with full game play match ups and commentary if you know it (not a boxer pete and and jay sea, cause imma already watchin them, and not hao cause it to old videos and ofc basics can help but still, old meta old champs somethin was reworked and ect). And again thx for reading my post and sry for my eng, not a native speaker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the problem with static it wont help u if u cant trade, this is the reason many trynds go tiamat ( as said mate in 1st post.) and they for better trandin they rush BC so with E he can just turn itno enemy and get movements speed so here i can go trade. but if i'll rush static against somethin like kayle it wont give me much unlike tiamet with regen of health and more healty wave clear.</TEXT>
