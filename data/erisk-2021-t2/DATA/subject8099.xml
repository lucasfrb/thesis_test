    <TEXT>**Name:** Bouncer **Alignment:** Mafia **Type:** Mafia Killing **Mode:** Classic **Attack Type:** Unstoppable **Defence:** None **Summary:** A corrupt bodyguard who sells protection to the mafia. **Abilities:** Protect a Member of the Mafia from any attack at night. **Attributes:** If your target is attacked or is the victim of a harmful visit, the visitor will die.

This role is meant for protecting members of the mafia if they, say visit an alerted Veteran, or is shot by a Vigilante. Unlike the Bodyguard, they do not die after protecting their target, however they do not get any vests like the Bodyguard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically what the title says. I personally want Tony and Nebula to interact a lot, seeing as they are the only survivors on Titan, I want to see how their personalities bounce off of each other and how they think of one another. If I were to guess, Nebula would take a slight dislike to Stark as he is annoying at times, but that might not happen due to the snap and all. Another one I #8217;d like to see is Rocket and Rhodes, because Rocket definitely wants a suit that he can fly around in, wouldn #8217;t he?

    <TITLE>My Buff/Rework Suggestions (Plus Reasonings)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-04 09:42:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>#**Heal (Buff)** - Heal: +48% - Elixir: +1 This change makes it so that Heal almost heals an entire Royal Hog group, while increasing the cost to compensate for this. Heal right now is the least used card, and has a very low winrate at 24% in Grand Challenges. Increasing the heal amount would help buff the card and finally make it into the meta. #**Bomber (Buff):** - Can now Target Air The Bomber is also one of the least used cards, mainly because he is so fragile and can be easily picked off by air units. If he can target air, Minions and Bats would no longer be effective against him, and he would finally be more threatening, like a cheaper, weaker wizard. #**Bomb Tower (Buff):** - Can now Target Air To add consistency between the Bomber and the Bomb Tower, and for the same reasons, so that air swarms are no longer a threat. #**Cannon (Buff):** - Hitpoints: +32 - Range: +1 - Lifetime: +10sec Cannon has never seen any light in over two years, hell it can #8217;t even reach both lanes when put in the centre. Increasing its hitpoints would allow it to take 2 extra hits from Barbarians, while increasing its range would allow it to hit units from both lanes with its placement. Increasing its lifetime would allow it to not die before it can be used. #**Freeze (Rework):** - Duration is now locked at 4.9sec. - Freeze now scales every level, 60% at TS. Freeze and Rage suffer from being weak at lower levels and strong at higher levels. Scaling on effects rather than duration can help fix them and balance them in every arena. #**Rage (Rework):** - Duration is now fixed at 7.5sec - Rage now scales every level, 35% at TS. Freeze and Rage suffer from being weak at lower levels and strong at higher levels. Scaling on effects rather than duration can help fix them and balance them in every arena. #**Graveyard (Buff):** Duration: 10sec - gt; 7.5sec Time Between Skeleton: 0.375sec Graveyard suffers from not having much damage done, and being easily countered. Having the skeletons spawn quicker would make it appear much more of a threat, and make it so that it damages things quicker. It also makes it so that poison lasts longer so that none survive. #**Royal Recruits (Buff):** - Elixir: -1 - Hitpoints: -12% Basically what was proposed in the balance poll.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>To all those curious about what the average cost of all cards in the game are.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-11 08:27:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>A question I wondered was what was the average cost of all 88 cards in the entire game. So I decided to calculate this. Here are how many cards are at each cost: - 1 Elixir: 2 - 2 Elixir: 10 - 3 Elixir: 22 - 4 Elixir: 22 - 5 Elixir: 15 - 6 Elixir: 9 - 7 Elixir: 4 - 8 Elixir: 2 - 9 Elixir: 1 - ? Elixir: 1 Since Mirror is put at 2 elixir in-game when it is being calculated for deck averages (due to it always +1 the previous card #8217;s cost), the cheapest it can go is 2, mirroring an Ice Spirit or Skeleton. Added up, all cards in the game count up to 360. After I added everything up, I divided it by 88, the amount of cards in the game. At this, I got 4.09, rounding up to 4.1. That is the average cost. 4.1. Here is the equation: ( 1  #215; 2 ) + ( 2  #215; 11 ) + ( 3  #215; 22 ) + ( 4  #215; 22 ) + ( 5  #215; 15 ) + ( 6  #215; 9 ) + ( 7  #215; 4 ) + ( 8  #215; 2 ) + 9 = 360 / 88 = 4.1 Hope you all enjoyed this useless piece of info.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[IDEAS] Guard Troop, unlocked at Builder Barracks Lvl9.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-05 22:57:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Guard is a troop that has two healthbars, one for his shield, and another for his health. It is based off of the Guards Troop from Clash Royale. **Level 1 Stats:** - Shield Hitpoints: 100 - Hitpoints: 75 - Damage: 97 - Damage Per Second: 81 - Units per Camp: 1 - Attack Speed: 1.2sec - Movement Speed: 20 - Favourite Target: Any - Damage Type: Single Target - Targets: Ground - Spring Weight: 2 **Ability: Guard Swarm** When a friendly troop within 7 tiles is about to die, all Guards will increase their speed and swarm around it to protect them from further damage. Only works on Boxer Giants, Baby Dragons, Cannon Carts, Battle Machine, Night Witches, Drop Ships and Super PEKKAs. Buildings will retarget onto the Guards, but Splash Units can still kill the protected unit. **Notes:** All units in a camp are placed down when going to place down 1 Guard. For example, if there are 3 Guards in one camp, spawning 1 Guard spawns all 3. **Upgrade Differences:** - Lvl2: Guard Swarm Unlocked (+2 Guard Speed) - Lvl3: +10 Shield Hitpoints, +5 Hitpoints, +4 Damage - Lvl4: +1 Unit per Camp - Lvl5: +12 Shield Hitpoints, +6 Hitpoints, +5 Damage - Lvl6: Guard Swarm: +3 Guard Speed - Lvl7: +16 Shield Hitpoints, +8 Hitpoints - Lvl8: +8 Damage - Lvl9: +1 Unit per Camp - Lvl10: +18 Shield Hitpoints, +10 Hitpoints, +10 Damage - Lvl11: Guard Swarm: +4 Guard Speed - Lvl12: +20 Shield Hitpoints, +12 Hitpoints - Lvl13: +1 Unit per Camp - Lvl14: +13 Damage - Lvl15: Guard Swarm: +5 Guard Speed - Lvl16: +25 Shield Hitpoints, +15 Hitpoints, +15 Damage **Level 16 Stats:** - Shield Hitpoints: 201 - Hitpoints: 129 - Damage: 152 - Damage Per Second: 127 - Guard Swarm Speed: 34 - Units Per Camp: 4</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When is Steven Universe Coming Back?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-14 05:40:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everyone keeps asking when the show is coming back, so I have decided to give you an estimate for when I think it will most probably be brought back. **Never** Nah, in all seriousness, I do have some proof and evidence for this. Some Things we need to remember: 1. They usually announce episodes two weeks ahead of time. 2. They almost always announce on Mondays 3. There is still another 4 episodes releasing from the end of the year in the form of a 4 episode event like Wanted ( #8220;Change Your Mind #8221;), Legs From Here to Homeworld is apart of these 4 episodes. So from this conclusion, we can come to the conclusion that there is an announcement on the following dates: - November 19th (Most likely) - November 26th - December 3rd - December 10th (Unlikely due to Christmas overlap) Any later dates brings new episodes into 2019. Therefore, if we pay attention to those four dates, we can get a rough idea on when the show is coming back, so lets put down our pitchforks for the time being. I think November is most likely because that was when the show came back in 2016 and 2017 after they had hiatuses. So be on a lookout for announcement on those dates. If they are wrong, lets just raise our pitchforks anyways.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Twenty Special Challenge Ideas that I would like to see in Clash Royale (Clone, Slowdown, Deck Switch ect.)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-11 10:57:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello r/ClashRoyale I am subject8099, you might have seen me post a few card suggestions here and there, such as Dark Princess, Inferno Spell, and Super Archer. But today I am doing something different than just card suggestions that will never make it into the game. I have made a list of 20 special challenge ideas for Supercell that I think should be in the game. They go from just simple things like Half Elixir Mode to things like Troops vs Defense mode, which is similar to Clash of Clans. I made this post because Supercell just seems to have the same old challenges every so often and not really have that many new modes added (This is obvious with Clan Wars prep day). So I decided to make some suggestions in hopes to spice things up and keep the game fresh for everyone. These ideas are just what I would like to see in the game, you might have different opinions, and if you do, good for you, everyone is allowed opinions. Any and all feedback is welcome, as well as any criticism, as long as it is constructive and is not just the simple  #8220;Stupid idea, #8221; or  #8220;Delete this post, #8221; sort of thing. Enough of this little text wall, here are the ideas: #New Gamemodes: 1. **Poison Mode:** All Units take 75/30 damage every second, doubles in sudden death. King Tower is always activated due to poison damage. 2. **Clone Mode:** Every 30 seconds, all troops in the arena are cloned. Prepare for eternal chaos, but remember, you cannot clone a clone. 3. **Slowdown Mode:** Everything in the arena is slowed down by 35%, basically a reverse Rage Mode. Rage Spell is recommended. 4. **Half Elixir Mode:** Elixir is gained at half the speed (1 elixir every 5.6 seconds). Cheaper cards and Elixir Pumps are recommended. 5. **Ramp Down Mode:** Game starts at 3x elixir, after the first minute, elixir is changed to 2x, the second minute, elixir is changed to 1x. 6. **Deck Switch Mode:** Every minute, players switch decks with each other, levels are changed as well, so if you have an underleveled card, it gets upgraded to whatever your opponent had. 7. **Rarity Mode:** You build a deck using only one rarity, that means All Common decks, or All Legendary decks. 8. **Lightning Mode:** Every 15 seconds, the highest hitpoint troop on each players team takes lightning damage (arena towers are struck with lightning if there are no troops, if troops have less hitpoints than the arena towers, they are still struck). 9. **Deathmatch Mode:** The battle goes on after the Kings Tower is destroyed, however if all your troops die, its game over. Elixir is stopped once your King Tower is destroyed, however if you manage to destroy the enemy king tower, you could potentially wipe them out and win. 10. **Invisible Mode:** You cannot see enemy troops on your opponents side, only your troops. You can still see them on your side of the arena. Basically what Nick and Molt did in this video: https://youtu.be/9-k_ZAoS0zs 11. **Deck Vacuum Mode:** Every minute, all cards used by you and your opponent are sucked into a vacuum and given back to both of you, randomising your cards in your deck by giving you cards that your opponent had, but still keeping some of your own. 12. **Troops vs Buildings Mode:** One player tries their best to take down your king tower within 3 minutes while the other tries to defend with only buildings. After time is up, you switch places. Defender can only have buildings in their defending deck, Offender can only have spawners and X-bow/Mortar. You have two decks, Defensive deck and Offensive deck for both rounds. Whoever took the shortest amount of time to destroy the king tower wins. 13. **Double Storage Mode:** Elixir is capped at 20. A good mode to have large pushes, and also to save up on a ton more elixir. 14. **Fragile Towers Mode:** All arena towers only have 1 Hitpoint. Spells cannot damage towers in this mode so that whoever zaps the King Tower first wins. Goblin Barrel, Graveyard and Miner are banned so that they are not overpowered. 15. **Kings Only Mode:** The Princess Towers are removed, that means you better protect your King Tower with your life. You can place things where you normally could if you had destroyed two princess towers in a regular game. 16. **No River Mode:** The River is removed and replaced with ground. Basically Touchdown, but with arena towers and no touchdown. So basically nothing like Touchdown. 17. **Two Cards Only Mode:** You can only use two cards, choose wisely. Buildings are banned except for X-Bow/Mortar and Spawners. There is only two deck slots in your hand instead of four, so there is still the small 2 second cooldown between placements. 18. **Double Damage Mode:** Cards and Towers deal 2x damage. Hitpoints are not, so Tank Killers and Swarms are extra powerful here. 19. **Random Sudden Death Mode:** Sudden Death adds new attributes every minute. So there could be Poison, Triple Elixir, Rage in Sudden Death. Attributes include: Double Elixir, Ramp Up, Ramp Down, Triple Elixir, Rage, Slowdown, Deck Vacuum, Deck Switch, Poison, Feeeze Towers, Double Damage, No River, Double Storage, Invisible, Lightning, Clone, Half Elixir. 20. **Freeze Towers Mode:** Arena Towers shoot frozen arrows, slowing down enemies by 35%. They are basically Ice Wizard Princess Towers. #Changes: 1. Added more to the descriptions of every gamemode for better understanding. 2. Adjusted Poison, Fragile Towers and Ramp Down modes. Changed One Card Only to Two Cards Only.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Theories for Episode IX</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-31 07:48:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>What are your theories? Here are mine: 1. Snoke #8217;s second apprentice is the main villain, they siezes control over the First Order, Hux is much more fond of the, and would prefer that they rule the First Order. 2. Rey has a yellow lightsaber, created through merging the kyber crystals of the Skywalker Lightsaber and Luke #8217;s old Lightsaber. 3. The final battle is on one of the core worlds (I would pick Coruscant) 4. The allies for the resistance are: Wedge Antilles, Mon Mothma, Lando, Maz Kanata, Kazuda Xiono (would be cool for the Star Wars: Resistance fans) 4. Rey dies in a fight against Snoke #8217;s second apprentice, Kylo avenges her but is also killed. 5. Leia dies in another bridge explosion. 6. Rose has less of a role than in TLJ. 7. The falcon is destroyed in an epic chase through the skyscrapers of Coruscant, Chewie survives through Rey saving him with a force pull. 8. By the end of the film, only Finn, Rose, Poe and Chewie are the main characters still alive. 9. Kylo Ren becomes a fugitive to the First Order after Snoke #8217;s murderer is revealed. He defects to the Resistance, although there is major trust issues. 10. Phasma and the Knights of Ren are the only ones on Kylo #8217;s side after his secret is revealed. 11. Phasma has about as much screentime as Hux in TLJ. 12. The movie is either called  #8220;The Final Hope #8221; or  #8220;Rise of the Rebellion #8221;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Suggestion: Trophy Road + Rewards</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-29 02:42:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Brawl Stars has an awesome feature where you get certain rewards for reaching trophy milestones, such as unlocking a new brawler at 1000 trophies, or 50 gold at 1400. I decided to come up with a replica for this in Clash Royale, with different rewards scaling up to help new players face those with stronger cards, and help fasten progression. These rewards contain the following: Gold, Gems, Cards, Tokens, Arenas and Chests, plus a special emote for reaching Hog Mountain. These rewards stop at 4000 trophies when Leagues start, as you end up getting Draft Chests at the end of every season. If you have already passed the milestones, then you can claim your rewards at any time. I have bolded wherever a new arena is unlocked. They are unlocked in the same locations as they are unlocked at the time of the Spooky Town update. - 0: **Goblin Stadium** - 100: 50 gold - 200: 10 gems - 300: **Bone Pit** + 5 Random Commons - 400: Magical Chest (Arena 2) - 500: 20 Random Commons - 600: **Barbarian Bowl** + Gold Chest (Arena 3) - 700: 1 Random Epic - 800: 1000 gold - 900: 25 gems - 1000: **PEKKA #8217;s Playhouse** + Magical Chest (Arena 4) - 1100: 15 Random Rares - 1200: 1 Giant Chest - 1300: **Spell Valley** + Giant Chest (Arena 5) - 1400: 1 Common Token - 1500: 2500 gold - 1600: **Builder #8217;s Workshop** + 33 gems - 1700: 1 Rare Token - 1800: 50 gems - 1900: 1 Epic Token - 2000: **Royal Arena** + 1 Legendary Token - 2150: 5000 gold - 2300: **Frozen Peak** + 500 Random Commons - 2450: 1 Legendary Token - 2600: **Jungle Arena** + 50 Random Rares - 2800: Lightning Chest (Arena 9) - 3000: **Hog Mountain** + Exclusive Emote - 3150: Legendary Chest - 3300: **Electro Valley** + 15 Random Epics - 3450: Mega Lightning Chest (Arena 11) - 3600: **Spooky Town** + 1 Random Legendary - 3800: 10000 Gold - 4000: **Legendary Arena** + Legendary Kings Chest (Arena 13) Supercell will probably not add this, but it is fun to at least come up with ideas for the Trophy Road.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Balancing Ideas with reasons (Musketeer, Barbarians, Bomber  amp; More)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-04 22:34:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I decided to make a list of what I believe should happen in the next balance changes. The following cards are included in the balancing: Barbarians, Barbarian Barrel, Bomber, Heal, Musketeer, Three Musketeers, Giant Skeleton, Balloon, Freeze **Barbarians: -8% Hitpoints, +1 troop** This change will change the way interactions work with Barbarians. Mini PEKKA will now kill an equal level barbarian in 1 hit, and arena towers will take 1 less hit to kill as well. This will help counter Barbarian Barrel, Battle Ram and Barbarian Hut by making each unit take 1 less hit to kill by most means. There is 1 extra barbarian added to the 5 elixir card so that it can keep its 5 elixir cost without feeling overpowered, and help it shift into the meta. This also keeps the card as a 5 elixir tank killer instead of being 4 elixir like all the other tank killers (except PEKKA) **Barbarian Barrel: +1 Elixir, +50% damage** Since Barbarian Barrel overshadows The Log at times, as it deals similar damage and spawns a Barbarian, increasing its elixir to 3 and adjusting its stats accordingly will help equal things out, and make it more comparable to Arrows than Zap, Snowball and Log. This new change will allow the Barrel to now kill Bombers in 1 hit. **Bomber: Can now target air** Lets face it, Bomber is useless, he is basically a fragile Wizard that cannot hit air units. Allowing him to target air will allow him to become a cheaper alternative to the Wizard, and help counter Minions and Bats, as there isn #8217;t a splash unit that costs 3 elixir that targets air, this will help make the card unique. **Heal: Now heals instantly** What is the point of having heal not heal instantly when it heals so little? Changing the duration to instant while still keeping the same heal amount will help keep troops alive that might die while you are trying to heal up your troops. **Musketeer: -20% Hitpoints, -9% Damage, -1 Elixir** This is a rework for the Musketeer that will hopefully keep her strong while also balancing the Three Musketeers. By decreasing her hitpoints by 20%, she now takes 1 less hit to kill by a Knight, Mini PEKKA, Night Witch, Mega Minion and Arena Tower. This also helps devalue the Three Musketeers as now its 3 for the price of 3 instead of 3 for the price of 2 and a bit. Decreasing her damage by 9% makes it so that she cannot kill goblins in 1 hit anymore at an equal level, but still do around the same damage as a knight. This balance change will mostly make her feel like a ranged Knight. **Three Musketeers: -1 Elixir** To fit in with the Musketeer rework, so that the card is still viable. This change is also so that the card isn #8217;t 10 elixir, because there shouldn #8217;t be 10 elixir cards in the game, all they do is make you leak elixir. **Giant Skeleton: -1.0sec Bomb Timer, -20% Damage** The Giant Skeleton #8217;s main problem is that his bomb takes too long to explode, which gives enemy troops the time to escape, especially if they are fast. Decreasing its timer to 2 seconds will help kill those in its radius, and be more useful. The stats are decreased by 20% though to accommodate this change. The bomb will still kill troops like Electro Dragon, Bandit, Night Witch and Regular Witch, but will no longer have that much of a devastating blow, leaving less damage on tankier troops, but damaging them easier. **Balloon: -1.0sec Bomb Timer, -20% Damage** This change is the same with the Giant Skeleton to keep consistency between the two. The Balloon Bomb still 1 hit kills equal level minions, but now no longer kills Archers, but Dart Goblin, Princess and Rascal Girls do still die in 1 hit if equal level. The reasoning is the same as the Giant Skeleton. **Freeze: -42% Damage, -1 Elixir** Another rework of the Freeze spell, making it 3 elixir. Now the damage is decreased to the fact where it can only kill equal level Skeletons and Bats. The duration is also adjusted due to the elixir change, now being 3.5 seconds instead of 4 to soften the blow that the card gives. Fire Spirits no longer die to freeze. Update: Removed duration nerf.</TEXT>

He wields a blue lightsaber and is discounted in Prequel and Original Trilogy era maps (He was a Jedi Padawan). **Lightsaber Damage:** 135 **Default Hitpoints:** 750 #Appearances: [Jedi Knight (Default)](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRNTNogZv70fbrTFg5MCQstV_DJ5qkvyNlvPbFa1c0rfOJZw07G) [Blinded (Epic)](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/33/3e/11/333e116af5d31bcee6fd589555f20719.jpg) [Lothal Rescue (Epic)](https://sfzone1-legalbrandmarket.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/star-wars-rebels-kanan-pic.jpg) #Emotes: Fear - There is something stronger than fear, the force. Scars - Battles leave scars, some you can #8217;t see. Mistake - That was a mistake. Soldiers - Fighting alongside soldiers isn #8217;t what I signed up for. #Abilities **Ability One: Unrelenting Repel** Kanan builds up his strength, force pushing those in front of him while also pushing himself backwards. Think of Obi-Wan #8217;s All-Out Push, except it pushes you back as well. Range: 1-18m Damage: 15-150 Recharge: 20sec **Ability Two: Force Levitate** Kanan manipulates the ground around him, allowing him to float above the ground and above chasms and drops for a few seconds. Duration: 5sec Recharge: 15sec **Ability Three: Echolocation** Kanan concentrates the Force, allowing him to drain less stamina, deal more damage and see enemies through walls. The screen also goes dark gray and enemy players are defined by a faint blue outline. Less Stamina Drain: 50% Damage Increase: 20 Duration: 10sec Recharge: 25sec #Star Cards: **Purge Survivor:** 20 health upon killing troops. 25/35/45/60 health for killing heroes. **Wisdom of the Bendu:** 8/10/12/15% less stamina drain from Echolocation. **Spectre One:** Nearby allies are assisted with Force Levitate. Recharge time is increased by 7/6/5/3 seconds. **Jedi Strength:** 30/60/90/125 more health regeneration. **Trained to Run:** Jump height is higher, movement speed is faster, deal 15/13/11/8% less damage. **Ghost Savior:** Unrelenting Repel has 12/24/36/50 more damage and has a 5/7/9/12% stronger push. **Force Eyes:** Echolocation lasts 1/2/3/5 more seconds. **Swift Levitate:** 10/13/16/20% increased speed while Levitation is active. **Heroic Repel:** Unrelenting Repel #8217;s radius is 15/18/21/25% larger.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by not checking my university notices.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-01 23:34:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Unlike most other posts on this sub, this actually happened today, in fact I just got back from what happened. A bit of background before I get started, I live in New Zealand and I am 20 years old (birthday was actually yesterday), I live about an hour and 10 minutes from the university that I go to, and I usually walk 20 minutes down a hill to get to the nearest train station, ride the train for 40 minutes and then catch the nearest bus to my university which is about a 15 minute ride and a 5 minute wait at the bus stop. Anyways, onto my fuckup. I was in a real rush to get to my university this morning, I usually start at 9:30am on Thursdays and I was running a bit late due to my sisters boyfriend hogging the shower and also because I really wanted to sleep in after going to bed at 2am. I had my birthday off as I just wanted to stay at home and play God of War all day, so none of the tutors at my university was able to tell me about what I did wrong. I went to school on a no school day. Usually all of the students get sent a list of notices that is going on that day, such as if classes are moved to different rooms or if there was a schedule change. Today I got the list of notices but elected to not read it since I was running late, and it just so happens to say:  #8220;May 2 2019 - University is closed today due to 2020 enrolments. #8221; Thats right, the one time I don #8217;t check the notices is the time there is no school. So when I finally get there, it is about 9:40am, and there seems to be nobody there, so I thought class had already started, so I walk through the front door to go to my usual classroom and proceed through the corridors while speed-walking (I don #8217;t want to run because I #8217;d look weird just running through a corridor), and when I am halfway to my usual class, one of the tutors opens up their classroom right as I am walking by and asks me  #8220;Hey, aren #8217;t you a little old to be enrolling? #8221; At first I was confused and just asked  #8220;What enrolment? #8221; I think the tutor found me being oblivious as funny as he was chuckling for a bit before he told me that there was no classes today because it was enrolment day and that all that was happening today was the tutors showing potential new students around the campus so that they can decide if they want to go there next year or not. Pissed off, I decided to go outside and wait for my bus to arrive so that I can go back to the train station and go home. On my way back, I had the stupid idea of telling my friends that I went to school on a no school day in our snapchat talk group and they all laughed at me and calling me a dumbass. I really shouldn #8217;t have told them because now they are not going to shut up about it. After a long and agonising trip home, my sisters boyfriend was sitting at the kitchen table doing his studying as I walked in through the front door (kitchen table is right next to the front door and my sisters boyfriend goes to a different university). He asked why I was home when I shouldn #8217;t be until around 4:15pm (It was now 11am) to which I replyed that it was enrolment day and that there was no classes. He laughed in my face as well, though he didn #8217;t call me a dumbass like my friends and said that I should #8217;ve called him for a ride home so that I didn #8217;t have to waste money on my trip back. So now here I am, pissed off that I woke up with only 5 hours of sleep, rushed out the door and wasted 2 hours 30 minutes because there was no classes today. My friends are now sending tons of messages making fun of the situation, and now my mum just texted me to go vacuum the whole house, fuck my life. **TL;DR:** Took day off yesterday which was my birthday which made me unaware of no classes the next day, arrived late at my university just to find out that there no classes, one of the tutors, my friends and my sisters boyfriend laughed in my face because I didn #8217;t know there were no classes and wasted 2 and a half hours going to and from the city where my university is.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[IDEAS] Goblin Cage</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-20 00:23:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ever wonder what happens to those Goblins after you destroy and loot their villages in the campaign? Look no further than the Goblin Cage. Now having been caught by your army, they are now locked up in cages. These cages do nothing while they are still standing, however if they are destroyed during a raid, the Goblins will charge out and attack the enemy attackers. It is a 3x3 size building that is unlocked at Town Hall 7. A second Goblin Cage is unlocked at Town Hall 11. It #8217;s hitpoints are 350 at every level. **Description:** Houses several goblins, when destroyed, they join the party to give the enemy a run for their money. This building is similar to the Guard Post from the Builders Base, except it has Goblins inside and must be destroyed to have any real purpose. It also will shift the meta a bit as you may need to carry 2 poison spells to take out both clan castle and the caged Goblins. #**Level One:** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 7 **Build Time:** 2 Hours **Cost:** 350,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 8 **Goblin Level:** 3 #**Level Two:** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 7 **Build Time:** 12 Hours **Cost:** 8,000,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 10 **Goblin Level:** 4 #**Level Three** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 8 **Build Time:** 24 Hours **Cost:** 1,500,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 12 **Goblin Level:** 5 #**Level Four** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 9 **Build Time:** 2 Days **Cost:** 2,750,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 15 **Goblin Level:** 6 #**Level Five** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 10 **Build Time:** 4 Days **Cost:** 4,000,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 18 **Goblin Level:** 7 #**Level Six** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 10 **Build Time:** 6 Days **Cost:** 5,000,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 22 **Goblin Level:** 7 #**Level Seven** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 11 **Build Time:** 8 Days **Cost:** 7,500,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 26 **Goblin Level:** 7 #**Level Eight** **Unlocked at:** Town Hall 12 **Build Time:** 10 Days **Cost:** 9,500,000 Gold **Goblin Count:** 30 **Goblin Level:** 7</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;m Having a Vision (When will the Movie release?)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-04 02:16:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, it #8217;s the Sapphire of r/stevenuniverse here. I am having a vision. A vision on what the future of the show will be and when the Hiatus will finally end. If you did not know, I am the guy that correctly guessed the announcement and release dates of Diamond Days back in the July - December 2018 Hiatus. https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/9yk7yj/i_predict_that_there_will_be_new_episodes/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app Anyway, onto me speaking about my vision. I predict that a movie date announcement will be revealed at San Diego Comic Con during the Steven Universe panel. From there, Cartoon Network will begin marketing the movie for it #8217;s Fall release (Fall in America is Sep 23 - Dec 22). Cartoon Network movies usually air on Fridays, which gives 13 Fridays for the movie to release on. So lets go through each Friday and narrow down which one the movie will release on. 1. Sep 27: Too Early 2. Oct 4: Too Early 3. Oct 11: Possible 4. Oct 18: **World Singing Day (Most likely)** 5. Oct 25: Possible 6. Nov 1: Halloween (Unlikely, it ain #8217;t a halloween movie) 7. Nov 8: Possible 8. Nov 15: Possible 9. Nov 22: Too Late 10. Nov 29: Thanksgiving (Unlikely) 11. Dec 6: Too Late 12. Dec 13: Too Late 13. Dec 20: Christmas (Unlikely) I am going to say that the movie will release on October 18th 2019 due to it being a day before World Singing Day, and if you didn #8217;t know already, the movie is going to be a musical. This fits with the release being in Fall 2019, and gives Cartoon Network 3 months to market the movie for it #8217;s television release. On top of that, Season 6 will most likely air in the following days after the movie releases. I am willing to bet on October 28th as it is a Monday and Cartoon Network likes to release new episodes on Monday nights. I believe that there has been all these major hiatuses since the Wanted arc aired in May 2017 because Rebecca and the Crewniverse has been focusing on making the movie, and after Diamond Days and Change Your Mind, the next step in the show was the movie, releasing Season 6 beforehand might confuse viewers as it takes place chronologically after the movie (hence the 9 month hiatus from Jan 21 - Oct 18). After the movie premieres, I fully expect the show to return to it #8217;s Post-Summer of Steven - Wanted Arc schedule in 2020, where there was at least one episode released a month for that time. We might even be getting a Summer of Steven 2 in 2020 to make up for all the hiatuses and release all the episodes the Network has been sitting on. But with that being said, I #8217;m going to leave it at that for now. When I get another vision, I will let you all know. ~ u/subject8099 / The Sapphire of r/StevenUniverse</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The update is not dropping for more than 12 hours</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-13 23:45:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>It is currently 12:40am in the UK (August 14th), however just because it is past midnight does not mean that the update will drop any second now. Last year during NEXT, the update did not drop until around 4pm UK time on the 24th of July. That is around 15-16 hours from now, so don #8217;t go questioning when the update will drop, it will happen soon enough. Just remember that Hello Games need to do last minute bug checks and fixes to make sure the game runs smoothly for when it releases. Sean even said on Twitter that it isn #8217;t coming now and you should all wait for tomorrow (or rather, when you wake up in the morning), as seen in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/nomanssky/status/1161409737268838402?s=21) he posted an hour ago. Beyond isn #8217;t releasing for another 15 or so hours, so I would stop refreshing if I were you until we get closer to the release time.

    <TITLE>My Ideas to fix every Brawl Stars Gamemode</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-21 23:54:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have been playing the game ever since Global, and I have noticed a few issues with almost every game mode whether they be annoying or just make the game less fun. So I have decided to make my own list of changes to fix every single game mode in Brawl Stars to help spice them up and make them more enjoyable for everyone. **Gem Grab:** - Add 2 minute 30 second timer. - Winning team is whoever has the most gems when time runs out. I just think the current system is annoying as if everyone of your team dies while the enemy is having their countdown, then it is near impossible to stop the countdown after they get 10 gems as you run out of time before you get to their side of the map. This new system would be much less annoying, whichever team has the most gems at the end of the game wins. Gems still drop on death and are retrieved from the middle, there just isn #8217;t a timer for when the enemy has 10 gems. **Showdown:** - Maps are no longer limited to 1 modifier, they are now random across every map. - Gas Cloud no longer goes towards center, instead it goes towards a random point in the map. I feel like these changes would make Showdown much more fun as each game would be more unique due to having a different modifier each round and a different place to fight your deathmatch in. An example of this is having Meteors on Cavern Churn and having the deathmatch be in the top right of the map instead of inside the bushes. Each game would feel more unique and not as repetitive as the last, especially since each map right now is locked at just 1 modifier. **Heist:** - Safes now have infinite health, winning team is whoever deals most damage. Just a minor change, games now last the full 2 minutes 30 seconds instead of a team managing to rush you and destroy your safe before you have time to retaliate. **Bounty:** - Star in the middle is now worth 5 stars. - Killing enemies with a super now grants 1 extra star - Dying loses your team 50% of your current bounty This would add some strategy into the game mode as it is currently just get as many kills as you can. With this new version, there will be more frequent battles over who gets the middle star as it now has 5x more value. It also adds strategy by incentivising you by wanting you to kill with your super for 1 extra star, and adds more of a penalty for dying by making your team lose 1-3 stars each time you die (doesn #8217;t go into negative numbers if your team is at 0 stars), this is to make attacks and rushes more risky but more rewarding if you manage to kill with your super. **Brawl Ball:** - Goals no longer have a wall in the front of them. - 3 goals needed to win the game. This is just a small change that would make games play better, as right now it is just a mosh pit on maps with walls and barriers in front of the goal as it is quite difficult to get through, removing the walls in front of the goal would make it so that you won #8217;t need to use a super to destroy them, as well as make it easier to score a goal, but adding a third goal requirement would help make games last just as long. **Siege:** - Increase Game Length to 3 minutes. - Siege 1 occurs at 2 minutes remaining. - Siege 2 occurs at 1 minute remaining, - Siege 3 occurs when the timer reaches 0. - Game ends when final Siege Bot is destroyed. - Safes now have infinite health, winning team is whoever deals most damage. - Remove clutter from the middle of the map. This is just a rebalance to make the game more enjoyable, each Siege happens every minute instead of every 30-60 seconds like it currently is, as well as helps aid comebacks as the game no longer ends while the final Siege Bot is alive. Safes also have infinite health to help support comebacks and not have the game end after the first siege (which can be annoying), and the first bolt collection phase is longer so that the team that immediately dominates the middle is no longer put at a massive advantage. Walls and obstacles in the middle of the map are now massively reduced so that combat is easier and ranged brawlers shine more (an example is More Assembly Required, which has incredibly hard pvp due to half the middle just being walls.) **Lone Star:** - Add Duos - Star in the middle is now worth 5 stars. - Killing enemies with a super now grants 2 extra stars. - Dying loses you 25% of your current bounty. - Showdown Modifiers now added. This is basically just adding consistency with the new Bounty changes, as well as adding the Showdown modifiers to make games more unique (killing the Robot gives 3 stars + how many players its killed). Duos is also added. **Takedown:** - Add Duos - Spawns are now closer to the middle. - Add 3 minute timer. - Boss now has infinite health, whoever deals the most damage is the winner. - Reduce the amount of Power Cubes by 50% - Power Cubes are capped at 10 per player at the same time. - PvP damage is reduced by 50% - Showdown Modifiers now added. These changes would help focus the objective on fighting the boss more so than killing other players. Reducing Power Cubes to 50% of what they currently are and cap them at 10 at a time would stop players from dominating the game and being invincible, while reducing PvP damage by 50% would help stop players from fighting each other and focus more on the boss. Spawns are now closer to the middle so that it is easier to get to the boss. Solo Showdown modifiers are also now added, though the Boss cannot pick them up (Robot modifier is absent). Like Siege and Heist, the Boss now has infinite health and the winner is whoever deals the most damage. Duos is also added.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It just makes things more confusing and annoying for those who aren #8217;t fans of Co-Op (like myself). There was zero need for this change and is just annoying because now whenever I go to play Galactic Assault (for example), I always accidentally end up pressing Co-Op instead. In fact, why does Co-Op even have its own separate folder? It #8217;s a multiplayer game mode just like the rest of them, only difference being that it is PvE. It should be moved to the Operations folder because it has no point having its own folder.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Rarity: Mega Legendary + 3 New Brawlers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-20 13:43:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I had an idea for a new rarity in the game called Mega Legendaries. These brawlers are twice as rare as Legendaries, however have two supers instead of one (there are 2 super buttons, though pressing one empties the other, both can #8217;t be active at the same time). Mega Legendaries are also meant to feel and play differently from other brawlers by having much different attacks and behaviour. The background of the brawler art is hot pink. It should be worth noting that Legendaries would get a boosted drop rate if a new rarity gets added due to the rewards in the chest pool needing to be adjusted to make room for the Mega Legendaries. I have also made 3 brawlers to go along with this new rarity: #Anna: Anna is a native of the amazon, she uses a bow to fire 2 arrows at once, with one going in the direction it was aimed while the other goes the complete opposite direction to hit any enemies behind her. **General Stats (Lvl9):** - Brawler Type: Sniper - Health: 3000 - Damage: 2300 - Attack Type: Single Hit - Attack Speed: 1.3sec - Ammo: 2 - Reload: 1.75sec - Range: 9.5 Tiles - Speed: Medium **Super: Arrow Barrage:** Shoots arrows in all 8 directions dealing 40% of the enemy #8217;s health that it hits. Has the same range as her regular attack. **Super: Homing Arrow:** Makes her arrows home in on enemies for 5 seconds, the maximum range is 4 tiles from the arrow for it to track onto enemies. **Star Power: Triple Shot:** Makes her regular attack shoot 3 arrows instead of 2, the front attack stays the same but the back attack is split into 2 so that it fires left and right instead of in the middle. **Star Power: Piercing Shot:** Allows arrows to pierce through enemies and hit any others behind them. #Perry: Perry is a pirate captain who uses his trusty cutlass to slash enemies down. **General Stats (Lvl9):** - Brawler Type: Skirmisher - Health: 5800 - Damage: 1200 - Attack Type: Single Hit - Attack Speed: 0.4sec - Ammo: 5 - Reload: 0.8sec - Range: 3 Tiles - Speed: Fast **Super: Cutlass Toss:** Perry throws his cutlass at the nearest enemy dealing double damage, it then bounces to the nearest enemy (within 5 tiles) dealing regular damage as long as there are ammo bars available. While the super is active he cannot use his regular attack. **Super: Energy Boost:** Perry gains unlimited ammo for 7 seconds. Reverts to how many he has after timer is complete. **Star Power: Bulky Swings:** Ammo slots are reduced to 3, however Perry deals 75% more damage. **Star Power: Second Wind:** When under 30% health, Perry runs 15% quicker and gains a temporary sixth ammo slot until he heals above 30%. #Valerie: Valerie is a Valkyrie who uses her trusty battleaxe to beat down enemies in a confined area by attacking them in all directions at once. **General Stats (Lvl9):** - Brawler Type: Batter - Health: 5500 - Damage: 1800 - Attack Type: 360 #176; Splash - Attack Speed: 1.5sec - Ammo: 3 - Reload: 1sec - Range: 2 Tiles - Speed: Medium **Super: Nordish Charge:** Valerie increases her speed by 35% and attack damage by 67% for 10 seconds, the super wears off instantly if she starts attacking. **Super: Defensive Swing:** Valerie summons a second axe to help herself in combat, doubling her attack speed and reload time while also reducing all damage by 33% while attacking for 7 seconds. **Star Power: Swift Spinner:** Valerie #8217;s attack speed is reduced to 1.2 seconds and reload time to 0.9 seconds. **Star Power: Super Charger:** Valerie #8217;s Nordish Charge no longer wears off when she attacks enemies, however the duration is reduced to 5 seconds.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So, what other character developments do you think will happen to break Steven?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-30 01:06:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Heres what I think: **Connie** ends up dating Jeff (the kid whose arm she broke in Mindful Education), which makes Steven really jealous, gets into a fight with her that ends up with them not talking to each other (like Connie did during Season 5) However in the end, she breaks up with Jeff off screen and in the series finale, she and Steven start dating. **Greg** starts dating again, after all it #8217;s been 17 years since Rose  #8216;died #8217; and he now has a new style. When Steven just decides to look over Homeworld with the other **Diamonds**, they reject him in favour of **Spinel** as she reminds them more of Pink than Steven does. This ends up with White turning pink. **Peridot** runs for mayor of Little Homeworld. **Ronaldo** begins to move out of Beach City as he was hired to be a professional blogger. **Peedee** opens his own restaurant. **Kiki** moves out of Beach City to become a professional athlete. **Buck** goes off to medical school. The Big Donut goes bankrupt, which puts **Dewey** out of a job. **Kevin** becomes a professional racer, but who really gives a shit. I have no clue what **Bismuth** will do as she hasn #8217;t really had that much to do at all in the show at all and there is really no direction as to where her character is going.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>u/mcjuggernuggets Nobody likes Storyfire. Storyfire has been available to everyone on the App Store and Google Play Store for about 2 and a half years now, yet bugs that were there during the app #8217;s launch are still there. Half the time someone uploads a video, the servers go down. Half the time someone opens up a video to watch, it doesn #8217;t load. You know there is a reason why reaction channels like KingLink86 don #8217;t do reactions to your Storyfire videos anymore, the platform is just too laggy and the video player is borderline unusable. You keep saying that Storyfire is going to be the true competitor to YouTube, yet it is just a reskin of Vimeo with a more complicated user interface. If you wanted to keep making money making videos, then why didn #8217;t you just start uploading on Vimeo? Oh yeah, that's right, you can #8217;t create a monopoly on Vimeo that heavily favours your friends and family instead of everyone else. I remember you saying that what you do is all about the content and not about the money, well the past two years have proven otherwise. I can assure you that nobody asked for Storyfire, yes people asked for a competitor to YouTube, but we didn #8217;t ask for a bug-filled, hard to use, laggy piece of shit like Storyfire is. In my eyes, Storyfire is much worse than YouTube because at least YouTube doesn #8217;t charge you money to watch videos, Storyfire is just shitty Netflix. YouTube is much easier to use as well and doesn #8217;t just spam your notifications with videos from people you aren #8217;t even subscribed to, I couldn #8217;t give 2 shits what Michael is up to, his channel went downhill the day Angry Grandpa died (may he rest in peace) and has just become Generic Clickbait Channel #4309. As Mark Hamill once said,  #8220;It doesn #8217;t matter if it #8217;s good, only if it makes money. #8221; Why can #8217;t we have it both ways? You can still make money while telling a good story, MVE was the last good thing you made, ever since then everything has felt like filler. Normally filler isn #8217;t too bad, but it has been 7 months since the last Devil Inside storyline (which I will get to soon), and everyone is just sick and tired of the repetitiveness of uploads. There is no vision, there is no plan, you are just dragging us along making us hope for better content when it will never happen. Your ego has clouded your judgment and we are all suffering from it. The Devil Inside was fun at first, Season 1 was brilliantly done, but after that, it just started getting really boring, really slow and just felt like filler. It wasn #8217;t creative, it just felt like a cheap way to rehash old things that made you popular in the first place even though everybody has moved on. This is the reason why your YouTube channel died, not because of the Adpocolypse, but because your content just got too shitty for people to tolerate and so they just left. I would go into the whole video submission bullshit, but that has already been done to death. I hope you take this all into consideration, because right now a lot of people are unhappy with your current content (especially this subreddit), and we really want you to return to your roots of having creative storytelling. I am a big fan of your work Jesse, I have been subscribed to you since April 2015 and have watched you even during the dark times, but come on, please for the love of god just please start focusing on making your content better instead of developing a dying platform that nobody ever asked for and wants to use so that we can all have a better 2020.

    <TITLE>What is everyone #8217;s theories for today #8217;s episodes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-06 14:36:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>What does everyone think will happen in today #8217;s episodes? These are my theories: **In Dreams:** - New Peridot Memes - Wormy Boi cameo - Lighthearted episode with depressing undertones - Contents of Lion #8217;s Chest are revealed (maybe another tape?) - Steven says fuck **Bismuth Casual:** - Mystery Girl and/or Kevin return(s) - Connverse actually becomes a thing  gt;!(setup for next week)! lt;
    - Maybe Stevonnie appears - Steven acts like a complete dumbass trying to impress Connie (like in Steven #8217;s Birthday and Kevin Party) - Lighthearted episode</TEXT>
