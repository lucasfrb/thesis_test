    <TEXT>This happens with me quite often. I play a lot of Skye and her hidden tends to be glitchy for some reason. It will either like you said, immediately go on cool down, or it doesn't show how much time is left in it until it goes on cooldown. But for when hidden goes on cooldown instantly, usually it does mean the controller/keyboard pressed the button twice on accident. But you said you didn't have this problem with any other champion, and neither do I. It could just be a bug, but I'm not sure</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was really intense, they almost won at the end. We tied 3/3, and things looked rough when Terminus died. So everyone for the last capture stayed on point to combat them, and luckily we won! Quick question, what was your level? Not sure if it really counts for much but in a 20 minute match...

    <TEXT>Sorry if this is quite late but, besides the obligatory "buy illuminate". There is her audio queues, Going stealth- "Come and get me" or "Poof! Haha" Her coming out of stealth results in a loud tone, alerting anyone nearby she is now visible (unless you already bought illuminate) Skye only has 2000 total health, and there are no cards to increase it Skye will usually check the scoreboard for which champion has illuminate, so she can change her playstyle accordingly. For example, Skye knows Lex has illuminate, so if the two get in an inclosed hallway together, Skye will most likely be more aggressive, because she knows she's not unseen anymore Check which talent she's running, her most deadly is Debilitate, for the sole reason it can make her poison bolts very deadly.. combining with her wrist crossbow shots You can hear her footsteps when she's invisible, which usually allows you to access where she is Skye is not very strong in a 2v1, if you're having trouble getting rid of her, try to have a teamate help you Skye's smoke screen creates a circle on the floor, which everyone can see. If you or a teamate has AOE damage, shoot into the circle, she is most likely trying to heal up so it might be an easy kill depending on the situation Try killing her from long range, her only 'range' damage is her poison bolts, her wrist crossbow is very short range If you or a teamate can, try stunning, crippling, or slowing her. This technically applies to all champions, but if Skye gets slowed it can be devastating if she is stuck near a bunch of enimie because she tried to sneak past them (pretty situational) Not sure if this will be too useful, but this is what I find her weaknesses are, if you need too. Just look up her audio queues on YouTube and listen to them a couple times: source, plays Skye a lot</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Androxus has a little bit of an edge against Skye personally, he can poke her from range. But i do also stick by the fact if she does get the jump on you, you're probably dead meat. Especially if she shoots her poison bolts. If you're low, and manage to escape, you need your healer immediately because it'll slowly kill you. I do hope you find teamates that aknoledge how much a threat Skye can be, if the team buckles down on her... she can be shut down</TEXT>

They seriously don't just say "Oh welp, yeah um. She'll die anyways, have a good day!" Like. The phone operater would be fired for something like that, even legal actions taken if it were to result in someones death or injury, or putting someone in harm's way. This actually makes me pretty mad, like, do these kids have any idea how shit like this works?! How about before making a GLMM you at the very least research the topic.

    <TEXT>I remember sitting down, and looking at the loading screens for the hidden battlestar for hourssssss. Confused as all hell, I would try and find every one. I remember finding some by accident as I was just exploring and goofing around. I would play with my squad... sadly none of them play anymore. I remember in season 3 that's all I heard around school. "Hey, Kuteis! Have you heard of Fortnite? It's like, really really fun, you absolutely need to try it!". So I went home that day, downloaded the game.. I was very confused at first, since I hadn't really played much online shooters before, but it was so different that CoD.. more vibrant, and pretty! It mechanically worked different, and I fell in love! I played on occasions, not religiously.. But i still enjoyed playing when I did! Around season 7 my friends started quitting... saying the game was boring now, and lost interest. Well, when season 6 hit.. I was determined! I had purchased my first battlepass, and off on my journey I went! I still play, and I still find this game enjoyable... i wish my friends thought the same (Sorry this is so damn long lmao, just thought I'd share my fond memories :) )</TEXT>

I usually play Skye on more enclosed maps where other champions I enjoy playing struggle, like I do love playing Maeve on Timber Mill, BrightMarsh, and Serpent Beach, because the map suits her. I play Talus on Shattered Desert and Bazaar usually, but I really hate his Ult if I'm not using it for a sniper. I tend to just not use it if there's nobody to use it on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I understand your point, people do crash during any time of the match. Beginning, during, or even when it's almost over. If you play controller ranked, from my experience Nintendo Switch players crash the most. It wasn't always like this, it has nothing to do with connection either, it's a game error causing the game to close. Trust me, I know. Just earlier today I crashed when it was 3/3 and we ended up losing because of it, which really sucks because it's not like I was mad and chose to leave. I'm not trying to be rude, I sincerely hope I don't come off that way. If you're on PC however, I don't know anything about how that works, I do know it can crash... But maybe it's not as often as other systems.</TEXT>

He would shakenly take the note, unfold it, and read aloud something along the lines of "I just can't take this anymore, you were the best I had... and I'm sorry I had to do this to you -------" so on.

    <TEXT>I play Maeve a decent amount, and I absolutely hate Street Justice. I prefer Cat Burglar, because not only the damage buff, I don't need to rely on a pretty good movement ability for a kill. I rarely use pounce to secure a kill or even for damage, mainly I use it for dashing above their heads and flicking around for a shot in the middle of a fight, otherwise I will use pounce to get up to higher places. Also, pounce' s base damage is 400, basically one dagger shot. With Street Justice it does the base 400 sure, but when the target is below the 35% health it'll do literally up to 1500-ish on a Tank. You even get this skull indicater showing you that the target is ready to be executed, your kda will look pretty killer I mean... 24/3/16 in a 15 minute match? That's ballistic! But the only way you got your kills was just finishing off the poor Terminus on point or the lonely Ying trying to take cover. While relying on that pounce for a garunteed kill, you aren't really gonna use it for mobility, which can really limit you to being just near ground most of the time, where you could easily be gunned down due to Maeve base health being a base of 1900, you could add to your survivability by adding the Street Cred loadout card to 5 for a max of 2150 health. Personally I don't find dishing 4 points into a health card is that great though, when easily Persistence or something like Walk It Off are just better to put some points into. Not sure if this is really what everyone's looking for, I feel like some of this might be my personal opinion.. But from someone with a decent amount of time on Maeve, Street Justice is not the talent to go for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have actually gotten a random kill with Maeve, not sure if it counts tho... So basically the enemy Corvus and Io were standing near eachother on an upper platform, Io was on a ramp and Corvus was above. So, naturally I pounced towards them to get height and I ended up accidentally assassinating the Io. I never realised she was that low! Also I didn't really see her, and I was trying to aim my pounce upwards but bounced off Io after killing her. And no, I don't run Street Juctice, I was running my normal Cat Burglar. Again, not sure if it really counts but still, surprised me nonetheless</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg, I solo queue Seige and it's a nightmare. I'll have in mind what roles I'm willing to play, either Flank or Support, but I'm a mediocre Tank. Anyways, the match starts.. and I have my team, for example the map is Serpent Beach, which is my favorite Maeve map, so I tap on Maeve real quick to show people that's who I want to play. Then, all of a sudden a Zhin or Skye (seems to be most common on my end) below level 5 immediately lock. Like, they obviously see I want to play flank, and choose flank. So then, now I'm annoyed I pick a healer, and wait to see what everyone else will play. Well now we have a Flank, 3 Damage, and me... on support. So I reluctantly lock in whatever support I'm playing that time and it starts. The loading screen usually looks something like this: My team: Zhin: Level 5 Viktor: Level 20 Tyra: Level 7 Vivian: Level 3 Ying: Level 40 (Or someone else I'll stick with my girl Ying ^-^) Enemy Team: Androxus: Level 25 Inara: Level 20 Drogoz: Level 45 Seris: Level 30 Evie: Level 35 So, this isn't exactly what the teams look like.. this is supposed to be a visual for what I get vs what I'm against... it's always a 0-4 stomp, and at then end all the dps on my team blame me for losing, when none of them played a needed role, or even played the role they chose well. I'll get a good amount of healing, but that's just not enough for us to win.. I actually love playing on even teams where everyone's champ is around level 25-30, because then the match is long and worthwhile.. not just an 0-4 or 4-0 stomp. And later, after the match is over I'll see that by looking up the match id on Paladins Guru, I'll see that either the entire enemy team is a 5 stack, or the entire enemy team is level 200+ while my teamates are always 60-80, 100 if I'm lucky (I'm level 128 I believe, close to 130). I feel like I don't play half bad, but I keep getting these teamates that are all for themselves! Sorry if I'm just complaining but, it's so hard for me to enjoy playing when my team is under skilled compared to the other, and i don't want to sound like I'm saying "Well I'm the best and everyone else is just garbage", that's not what I'm trying to say.. But seriously, stop matching me against a team that is 10 #215; better than mine. Anyone have ideas for what I can do as a solo queue?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An Au is an alternative universe. Basically there was a character that is very happy, and helpful.. in an alternate universe you change the characteristics of someone. So now this person in the main universe, is happy and helpful, in an alternate universe they are angsty, and rude. That's kinda the whole Undertale fandom, you could say. The main Au being Undertale, but the alternates being ones like Underswap, and Underfell. It takes the same characters, and changes the characteristics of them. You could even say an Au has different types of creatures or terrain unusual to our own! But what I hate in this post about the response "Its just her au", is you shouldn't really be able to take a real condition/disease and change it's effects, then go around and say "Well it's my Au I'm allowed to do anything I want with it!" While you wouldn't be wrong, it is your Au and you are allowed to do anything you desire to it, it's insensitive to so something like this. Hope you understand, I did go off on some wierd tangent but still ;^;</TEXT>

His Rune literally glows, sometimes it's hard to not miss it. Sometimes I do understand, you just want to place it and get on with what you're doing, but personally I feel at the beginning of each round, or after you redrawn you should take an extra second to play it carefully.

I prefer Cat Burglar over Street Juctice any day. I do want to learn Rouges Gambit, because it seems fun for hyper mobility though. Also, I just hate the playstyle of SJ, it's just killstealing honestly. I have a friend who "mains" Maeve and only uses Street Juctice because they think the talent is great.

The next match or so after I'm now dominating with a similar skill team (Or i get hard carried lol). And the enemy team will be full of newer players, with maybe a high skilled player paired with them. It's especially frustrating when I'm playing healer, but my team overall isn't too great, and even though i'm healing them, they're making stupid plays resulting in them dying. And then they just spam "Need Healing!" In VGS when they're pushed up way to far, and not capping point. Or they blame the loss on "The Ying that was worse than a bot" when I come out on top with healing, and people on my team with low-ish amounts of deaths. Trust me, we all feel it man ;-;</TEXT>

But, I ask my friend, who doesn't play flanks what their thoughts were on Talus, and they said the Rune was confusing (They're a tank/support main). So I do feel like you need to understand a couple things while playing him, such as- When to leave a fight When/How to use Blitz Upper And maybe where you're supposed to place a rune I still stand by my statement, he is by no means high skill, but depending on person to person the difficulty playing him can differ.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Moooood, I'm in general a bit shaky, just from normal anxiety, and maybe peer pressure to do well... I get so frustrated when someone is on literally no health but I just can't hit them. Also sucks when I crash in-game for no reason in the middle of a huge fight, I actually play on Switch so it's hella frequent. Also, level 97? Good job! I'll get champs to the level one day, but so far I'm happy with what I have :) Oh, and when people are being Toxic that I picked Maeve in the first place, it gets my anxiety up, because I want to do well to show them that Maeve was worth picking lol. I do fill roles, but damn is Maeve fun</TEXT>

I would be an idiot not to make such a wonderful edgy character a demon! All jokes aside, this genuinely makes so little sense. If they wanted such a cringey, edgy character they should've just stuck with that as the personality, instead saying they're emotionless, but feel anger and sadness.</TEXT>

If you don't have Saria's Song you need to go back to Kokiri Forest and enter the Lost Woods, follow the tunnels on which has the music playing the loudest. You'll enter into the Sacred Meadows where you'll need to go through this Maze-Like puzzle to find Saria. After you talk to Saria, agree to play the Ocarina with her, she'll teach you the song and you can go back to Goron City and play it for Darunia.

This was casual, which is casual there isn't much of a reason to get upset over something like this, it just happens way to often.. also they were last pick, I don't usually lock until there is 5-10 seconds left and the other people haven't chosen. I chose Seris since we needed a healer, and everyone else besides Skye had already locked. The Skye player never showed who they wanted to pick, otherwise I might've been playing Tank to fill the role. They had chosen last second with no indication on who. Again I understand this is just casual, and this happens.. also I really do apologise if I come of as rude</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel this way so often, I sometimes question why I fill roles and pick around what my teamates are. Of course the answer is "you have a better chance at winning", and "it's the right thing to do" but... if I want to play Maeve on Serpent Beach for example, I will click on her to show my team who I want to play, then I wait. Well now we have a Skye, Zhin, Corvus, and Viktor.. even though I had technically chosen first, I'm almost never taken into consideration when they lock. Usually in that circumstance I have a choice, play my tank of choice, or continue with Maeve and be the 3rd flank your team doesn't need. If I go with the tank option, usually what happens is I get 0 heals the entire match, and just suffer while trying to hold point. I seriously wish my teamates would be more cooperative, and work with me instead of against me...</TEXT>

The Skye in this picture never showed who they wanted, the entire time. And Sadly this was Siege, Stone Keep to be exact... I also want to believe that they think they're being helpful by just waiting, and not clicking anyone, but it really is harmful as you mentioned... we need to know who you want to play, so we can pick accordingly!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm kinda a Skye/Maeve main lol. Skye- Main Talent: Debilitate Usually I would play Skye on maps like; Magistrates Archives, Jaguar Falls, Primal Court, Stone Keep (Rarely), and Frog Isle (Rarely) I also love using Smoke and Dagger, so I can pick up on heals when I'm 99% sure our healer will be oblivious. Maeve- Main Talent: Cat Burglar Usually I would play Maeve on maps like; Serpent Beach, Stone Keep, Marauders Port, Frog Isle, BrightMarsh, and Timber Mill Maeve is really fun to play imo, but can be a little difficult if you don't understand that you don't need to use Nine Lives every single time you're out of cooldowns lol. Serpent Beach is by far my favorite map for her, I prefer going to the upper side, and figuring out what I'll do from there. Mainly what I ask myself when playing Maeve is; Where is the healer? Where is the backline DPS situated? Can I help kill the tank if they're low? Can I help fight off the other flanks going towards out healer because nobody seems to give a shit if our healer is alive or not, and then blame them that we lost because the healer went 1/15/8 because the GM Androxus was targeting them the whole game. (Ahem) Can I help make callouts on enemy position? Probably not that helpful honestly, if anyone's interested I can show you my loudouts, With Maeve personally I have quite a lot of self sustain</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So basically, the Zhin and Dredge left beginning of the match for seemingly no reason. If it was a crash I wouldn't have brought it to anyone's attention. But I'm actually a bit heated from this. Ok, so. Dredge wasn't connecting in very beginning, so I was like "Ok no biggie, 4v5 isn't too bad". Zhin had loaded in (I'm pretty sure), but he never picked a talent and just had left. Like straight up left... so now it's a 3v5 with a Focusing Lense solo healer Ying. Are you serious. Ok no problem, we have a tank I guess... so I'm trying to do my normal Maeve things, but it's difficult because we're 3v5. I did die alot, I won't deny that... But let me finish ranting please. So, now I feel like a 1v5. I feel like a one man team. Well, I've been losing quite a bit today, due to selfish teamates or just idiots. Everyone on either team was under level 50. My account level is currently 176, now I'm not sure how everything is rated, but this doesn't sound right. I felt like no matter what I'm doing it's just not working, I hate that I feel like I always need to be the bigger person.... and be nice, but it's hard sometimes for me to feel positive, and try to see the light in every dark situation... I also seem to have pretty bad matchmaking even if I'm with one friend, our team just seems to be uncoordinated, or pick stupid champions on maps where they won't perform too well at all. Sorry if this sounds like I'm bitching about things that don't really matter, but I just feel at such a loss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I take mental breaks often with this game, it's just so stressful even though I don't play the competitive mode. Actually, about 30 mins after this game, I was able to get back with my friend, and we played a siege, sadly on Warders Gate which is a map we both hate. I couldn't stop myself from laughing and just smiling! I played Maeve yet again (I swear I'm a masochist, I enjoy my pain). And the enemy had 3 healers, I went for jenos the most, and I would say stupid shit whenever I was coming up to him "Guess Who's back.. back again, Maeve is back, to kill your friends!" It's so cheesy, but I seriously couldn't help but smile and laugh. I just needed someone right there with me, because if I solo queue for so long I basically go insane lol. Oh, and at one point in the match for some odd reason I kept getting finishing blows on everyone, so I just like, yelled "BIITTTTCHHH" out loud for each person I finished lmao. I don't really care if all that sounds dumb, but my friend and I were smiling</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-12 15:26:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, my friend is a supposed "Maeve Main". He's hardstruck on her, but the problem is he runs street Juctice. I also play Maeve, but I have tons more hours on her than he does... I personally believe his loudout is atrocious but he won't listen, I also tell him not to play Street Juctice, he won't listen. How do I help steer him away from that talent? I would rather he play Cat Burglar, but it's his choice. Here's his loudout if anyone would be wondering Fight or Flight 3 Patch up 1 Cut and Run 5 Predation 2 Street Cred 4 Personally, I hate how cut and Run is at 5, like who needs that at 5. I've tried his loudout in training with the same talent, and I find it hard to play with that crazy speed boost which is highly unessicary, along with for street Juctice, even if he were to sadly keep playing the talent, he has no damage reduction on pounce, which I feel like is one of her main cards for street Juctice. I need help guys, any suggestion on how I should go about telling him the way he's playing isn't the best..?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah good luck indeed, he just doesn't want to listen to what I say about talents and such. And I guess it does sound like I am just telling him to play a certain way.. also he does think he knows everything about Maeve as well, like it's kinda ridiculous. And I guess he's trying to be helpful when he's telling me things about her I already know, but then he acts like an asshole when I tell him i already knew certain things. What's also hard is he's basically one trick Maeve, he has barely any clue how to play anyone else, I try to tell him on certain maps, like the more close quarters ones, that Maeve probably isn't the best choice here, he'll just tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. I also remember couple months back he challenged me to a Maeve 1v1, where we go through all the talents, starting with Cat Burglar, Street Juctice, then Rouges Gambit. It was 5 - 0 and he decided to quit right there, he wouldn't listen to any advice I gave and just kept doing what he was doing. I also feel like he just isn't really mechanically there ya know? He won't use pounce for movement, only rarely if with prowl he won't be able to reach somewhere. What I learned as well is he struggles with hitting moving targets, when we were fighting eachother I could see he was barely hitting me. I guess this may just be a rant, but you're right I can try and send guides his way and see if he listens :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah lol, when we were messaging about him re down loading the game (he keeps deleting, staying off for 2 months, then coming back), he said there's one rule "you are to not play maeve unless i approve it when were playing" That is exactly what he wrote, like??? I was confused about it, in my head I'm just thinking.. Dude you have 9 hours on her total.. I have 51 hours, why do you get to tell me when I'm allowed to play her???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally believe this is fine actually. I don't see this as sexualizing the MLP series which I do in Gacha Life Cringe frequently which is actually quite disturbing... anyways this is probably a child between the ages 8-11, which is my best guess. And they're just making fan content for a show they may enjoy. I believe that was an episode of the show actually, but I don't remember too well I haven't watched MLP since like 2014 lol. Anyways like I said, personally this doesn't qualify as cringe, but I guess I could understand why you think it does</TEXT>
