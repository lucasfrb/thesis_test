    <DATE>2019-07-08 16:00:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi I'm exporting a .gltf file from .blend. However since the gltf exporter isn't supporting exporting animations, we need to first export .fbx file from Blender, then re-import in Blender, then export .gltf. During the .fbx export, if I don't check force start/end keying, the actions would be exported differently; if I check it, there'll be some strange 90 degree rotation and scale won't work properly in the .gltf format. I wonder if there's any workaround for the force start/end keying? Appreciate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes, if you export to fbx then reimport it to blender then push down then export to gltf, the animations are correct. The only thing is the 90 degree rotation which is related to fbx's x axis rotation problem. I opened an issue under Khronos' repo a month ago, they say they fixed it and closed the issue, however the latest package still export animations incorrectly.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Button position in anchored parent GO for different screen sizes.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Say I anchored a parent GO ( x 0.1-0.9, y 0.2-0.8) to make sure it fits in different screen sizes. Then create a child UI image (function as prompt window) with preserved ratio, and add a button as child, expecting the button to be in fixed position(percentage) inside the UI image for all screen sizes. However the button position changes along y axis (move in/out of the UI image) as the screen size changes. Any solution for this? https://reddit.com/link/cg2dz8/video/ml4yo90mptb31/player</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to register 3d model.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-27 08:59:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, compared to the flooded makeup tutorials, I found zero demo of registering a 3D model other than Matlab's point cloud registering/stitching. However it only plots the vertex locations, no coordinates of the triangles, materials, none all that. Here is a 1sec model tri.ply in Blender, and the plotted in Matlab through `ptCloud = pcread('tri.ply'); pcshow(ptCloud)` https://preview.redd.it/s5n94oz5gyi31.jpg?width=1912 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=710fd0be263993d23bd66362492b518e7a90e967 What I'm trying to achieve is to label my own dataset, similar to [BaselFaceModel](https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/index.php?nav=1-0 amp;id=basel_face_model) , but not faces. If anyone knows how to achieve it, please let me know. Python preferred. Appreciate it. \----Update: Found a software called [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/), try it out and see if it's able to label the data points. Also looks like I misunderstood the purpose of 'registration', which is to align two different models (why?).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. Here's what I'm trying to do: 1. Perform some operations on different 3d models (also segment their regions. label features,etc), and get a 'base morphable model'(as a template). the morphable model should store all the info-- vertex\_num, (x,y,z), (x,y), segments, triangles, etc. 2. Align it's labeled 3d features to corresponding 2d images. As I understand, PCA is used to down-dimensionize data, ICP is for aligning 2 pointclouds. Say I have i.e 3d cat mesh A, B, C, and I perform ICP on A to B to C, it'll deform A to B to C, then get the transformations between them. But then how to get the base morphable model? Also it treats the 3d mesh as pointcloud, so where does the triangle info go? (please excuse me if I get anything wrong as it's real far from my expertise)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. 1. By annotating the model, you meant marking certain vertex or vertices as a feature point(s) or segmentation? Do you happen to know which tool is able to achieve it? 2. Basically the process for morphable model is to align the new input 3d mesh data against template such as SMPL or custom made template, to get the transformation parameters, then use these parameters to morph the template? I assume the alignment require both models to have same amount of vertices. What if it is impossible to make sure the models have same amount of verts? ( use some averaging methods? [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4023044\_3D\_Model\_Retrieval\_With\_Morphing-Based\_Geometric\_and\_Topological\_Feature\_Maps](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4023044_3D_Model_Retrieval_With_Morphing-Based_Geometric_and_Topological_Feature_Maps) ) If I remember correctly, voxel isn't able to produce high res reconstruction and computationally expensive.

    <TEXT>Adjacency matrix A: each row is a vertex, each column is a vertex, if there's connection between vertex i and vertex j, A(i,j) = 1. Otherwise 0. I didn't add the 0s for visually simplification. The polygon list is using vertex indices to represent connections. For example, f 1 2 5 4 3 means vertex 1 2 5 4 3 are connected to form the 1st face/polygon Yes, directly from my answer and input, there's no correlation. But if you use a pen to draw out the adjacency matrix input- make a line to connect the two vertices when A(i,j)= 1, you can get the same answer. But I think there should be an automatic way to get it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, those are too far. I'm thinking about the connectivity list. It should do two things: 1. find the number of polygons in the graph. 2. find the members(vertex number) of each polygon. Components is a different thing. In my example, vertex 5 is connected to vertex 6, but it's only an edge, so the graph contains two polygons, both of 5 edges. But the graph only has one component because of the connection between vertex 5/6</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sparse matrix A of values 0 and 1. A = (2,1) 1 (3,1) 1 (6,1) 1 (1,2) 1 (5,2) 1 (6,2) 1 (11,2) 1 (1,3) 1 ... For given row number I'd like to find and get the column number that has value of 1 in this row. I can do b=[2 6 11] tmpVar = [] for i = 1:length(b) col = find(A(b(i),:)); tmpVar = [tmpVar col] end % tmpVar = [1 1 2 2] But is there an easier way to do this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically you gotta use butt, legs(hamstring/calves), lats to push away. What about the percentage of strength you gotta put on the different muscles? I can feel my lats and butt, not much on calves and hamstring. And I #8217;m certainly using too much of biceps. Also what #8217;s the difference between quads and hamstring, thought they were the same thing? And yes the front of feet are shifting away from the plate, definite need to correct my form.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My laptop(Win 10) has an Nvidia Quadro M1200 and a built-in Intel HD 630. In a Ubuntu persistent live USB session, System Setting/Details lists my graphic card as `Intel #174; HD Graphics 630 (Kaby Lake GT2)` but I can choose '`Use Nvidia binary driver version 384.130 from nvidia 384 (proprietary, tested)`' in Software  amp; Updates/Additional Drivers. Considering that I intend to install tensorflow-gpu later to use my Nvidia graphic card, I'd like to know what's the difference between persistent live usb and a full install regarding the graphic cards and which one is the best fit for me?</TEXT>
