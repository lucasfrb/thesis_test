    <TEXT>You're right, the actual article is far worse. So you think a reliable source would have phrases such as "thanks to Jewish subversion and cuck interference", saying certain races are "genetically" inferior and calling "blacks" a "lesser race". No you're right, I'm very sorry, the thumbnail is just the tip of the bullshit iceberg here</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sadly US culture is a part of life in the UK so all we see day in day out is what Trump has done recently. To us what the US does on the world stage is in some way a representative of what we do because of our special relationship. We are far less forgiving to bigots and corruption here and due to our main media corporations (BBC, Channel 4, ITV etc) legally having to be somewhat politically neutral, we tend to get a reasonably unbiased story of what's happening in the world (yes I agree it's practically impossible to be unbiased, I'm making a comparison to companies such as Fox News which is probably one of the few reasons (that I can think of) as to why Trump is still so popular in the US). So basically what I'm saying is that we've never seen a politician in the western world within our generations life time, to be such a cunt. But I do agree, we have our own problems that need sorting but since we've had like 2 general elections and a referendum in the last 3 years alone we've kinda given up with democracy and suppose this is our one chance to let trump know how unwelcome he is here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've actually argued with so many alt right American 13 year old shits who are getting on their high horses about UK police and how London has deteriorated because there was a misinformed story that londons crime rate was high than New York's when it actually wasn't. Homicide rate in London is still lower than New York despite London having a large population. Regardless of this new York is still only the 67th most dangerous city in the US. You guys seem reasonable, but I just had to have a rant about all the little shits who believe every word fox news and trump say. Talking of which, anyone remember a few years ago when fox news did a report about Birmingham in the UK and how the brand new library (which took years to make and cost millions, and is actually a pretty god damn amazing library) was the Islamic extremists head quarters for Birmingham and they conduct their operations from there and the police can't enter and shit? Dunno where I was going with that, just highlighting how much out right lies fox news spews out. But seriously is there a law about that in the US?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your point and I know it's stupid to just say get rid of all the guns cos that won't happen and will be an incredibly difficult process. I'm just critising people who idealise guns and say there's nothing wrong with them. Yes it's people who kill, but guns seem to invite more killings than any other weapon due to it being so easy and somewhat emotionless to shoot someone rather than stabbing someone which requires much more determination. If guns were legal in the UK the crime rate might be exactly the same as the US, guns clearly are the problem. And yeah you can kill anyone with anything, but I don't see vans driving down school corridors picking off kids</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that is something I do prefer about the news over here. The UK population is too small for the main news corporations to be biased as they'd only appeal to a certain section of society so they simply wouldn't make money. News in the US however can stick to one political ideology and still make money due to the sheer size of the US population. So I do understand that's why different channels vary so much over there. I've just always seen the news as something that should inform us rather than something that tries to change our mind about things. Obviously it varies though because at the end of the day it's still made by people but I think there are actual laws in place that say they can't be too biased, that's why we have tabloids and other news papers that provide a far left or far right alternative such as the guardian and daily mail for instance.</TEXT>

Not really the point I was arguing as obviously it's not a competion.

    <TEXT>Don't suppose I'll ever understand. Just sounds like a lot of very confused little boys. Surely crime rates just boil down to how developed/how deprived a community is? The crime rate was high when it was a predominantly white city due to poverty. And the crime rate is still high (slightly higher now because of police cuts) because immigrants moved into poorer areas because that was the only affordable housing. It's just a never ending cycle that's amplified with lack of support from local councils/segregation There's a very clear historical path that follows, if a mass group of white people moved to a new country and had no choice to live in poorer areas/couldn't get jobs due to the colour of their skin I can guarantee they'd turn to crime as a means to make money Can't we all just calm down, have a pint and a pork scratching?

    <TITLE>Does persuasion do anything when levelling companions?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-15 12:30:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right so I've been playing m amp;b for almost two years and taken over the world a couple of times so I'm pretty familiar with the game (I play on console don't kill me I can't afford a PC). I've got around 5 companions all with skills that help me out besides one who is too low of a level to really add anything useful so I normally just jack up their persuasion skill even though it's a personal skill Because of this I always use them to relay messages to other kingdoms/tell other lords to gather near me when I'm marshal So I'm just wondering, does the persuasion skill affect this? Do more lords turn up if I use them to rally lords to me/are kings more likely to make peace if I send them as an emissary?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone remember a while back way before the game was announced there were a load of rumours about Lucas films giving Bethesda a deal, so naturally people assumed a star wars game. But when Disney bought star wars they handed the license to EA instead. However they're still rumours about starfield being what they initially started for the said SW game. Do you reckon they'll be a lot of similarities with SW in the game, or has there since been evidence to say it's bullshit?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sapphire follower mod on...ps4</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-15 19:58:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been using mods on PS4 for a while (I know this is a majority PC community so please don't kill me or judge me Ive been playing the game since it was first released and bought the remastered version like a sucker) I always play thief and since there isn't any decent followers for that class I wanted sapphire as one cos she's one of the few NPC's I can tolerate. So I got the mod called "follow me: sapphire" it says to help shadr with his debt problem (which I've done) and to place at the bottom of my load order (also done, even tried putting it at the top too) and nothing works. I tried starting a fresh save and doing the whole hard save uninstall hard save again resinstall thing and nothings worked. Just wondering if anyone has any insight to this, it's probs just ps4 mods being shite as usual, but yeah any help would be great.

    <TEXT>This won't sound that bad but honestly it was. Went to Croatia with a few mates and on the first day we went to the beach. I was amazed that I could buy 1.7L of lager in a bottle for what was equal to about  #163;1 so obviously I took advantage of that. So I lay on the beach and thought "my legs are always pasty and never tan so I won't put any lotion on just for like 10 minutes". Bearing in mind my family is almost entirely Irish and I'm white as fuckin snow all year round and it was around 37 #176;C out. So I drank my beer and past out, woke up feeling very sick and my legs starting to feel weird. Ran to the bar on the beach and basically dry heaved in the toilets for around 20 minutes. What followed was a horrific case of sun stroke and dehydration from the beer. But it gets worse. My legs basically turned into one huge blister. Image grey scale from game of thrones but for gingers. There was a constant stream of liquid oozing out and weirdly crystallising down my legs. I couldn't physically walk, like at all without extreme extreme pain and had to take 3-4 ibuprofen every morning just so I could walk for a few hours. The only thing that numbed it was excessive booze and a pill that we got off the strip there. Needless to say my holiday was fucked and I walked around with tears in my eyes. Though peeling off the skin a week and a half later was pretty satisfying. Always use factor 50 kids</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm interested in how they'll do it tbh. Because let's just assume that you'll be able to swim in this one, due to being able to fish and use a canoe and that. So I don't know how they'll stop you from going to certain places without you instantly drowning, and it's never been Rockstar's style to have invisible walls. Don't think the system of an instant wanted level would work like they did in gta4 either as you'll probably just be able to run away as you won't have about 6000 helicopters after you. Maybe if you have to swim through alligator infested water and then if by chance you make it you get a wanted level and can't call for you horse. Interesting either way though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right so in that demo gameplay they mention how they're working on what happens after you die. They say you'll become one of your 'family members' and you'll inherit their skills. Don't know if this has been mentioned in the past but does anyone know how this will work? By 'family' do they mean your blood relatives, if so does this mean you can actually have children with your chosen spouse? Or are they referring to your companions, as I know you have control of their skill trees. I hope it's the first one tbh, becoming your son or daughter and then avenging your father's death or carrying on their legacy would be a cool feature. But yeah, am I missing anything, discuss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's basically 4 months in a year which are basically split into seasons. I think there's about 30 days in each season so that's like 120 days in a year which goes by pretty fast. Maybe if you die and your kid isn't at a fighting age the game will just fast forward and have your spouse/companion acting as a steward until you are of age and the AI will just continue as they would've done. So your kid could start in a world very different to how you left it. Pretty cool if you want to go on a big revenge crusade</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question that has been bugging me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-26 12:32:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right so this has probably definitely been asked on here but I don't have the effort to scroll down. So, we always see in films where they go back in time and someone fucks up and then they or their pal end up not existing due to a chain of events. But to make things simple, let's say you go back in time to before you were born and kill either your mother or father. Obviously you won't exist as you will have never been born. But the obvious problem is, who killed your parent(s) if you weren't born. If you don't exist then no one killed them, which then in turn means that you will be born. I was really stoned and thinking about this and it's racking my brain. Obviously I'm not looking for a scientific explanation because it's time travel and almost impossible for us to conceive. Just want some general thoughts on it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does my ps4 have consistently bad download speeds?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-13 19:04:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right so I've had my PS4 more or less a year after it launched and the download speeds have always been terrible. And don't blame it on my internet I've lived in 5 different houses all with different providers (I was a student for 3 of those years so moved house a fair bit). My mates who I lived with had xboxs and never had an issue with download speeds. I'm currently downloading something that is 150 mb and it's taken almost 15 minutes, so imagine when I get a triple A game I basically have to wait until the next day to play it. I've googled how to fix this so many times, I know the pause and unpause thing but if anyone has any useful info to fix it please let me know. If not I hope to god Sony fixes this with the ps5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is why I love UK broadcasting, every major news channel has to be politically neutral by law, especially the BBC who's funding comes from the government. Note how Andrew Neil laughs when Shapiro accuses him of trying "to make a quick buck". BBC reporters don't receive more money based on how many views they get, it's a set wage, they won't try to promote a story, exaggerate a story or use fear tactics to keep people watching. Very much unlike their US counterparts where news channels function purely as a business and not as a means to inform people. Interesting video that looks at it and how it influences humour here, worth a watch, part about the news starts at 6:30 https://youtu.be/-tXuvzZKTI0</TEXT>

I'm 22 making me someone who suffer(ing)ed from said tuition fees, that's why I'm surprised they seem to be gathering more of the young vote.

When you criticise the way a book reads do you need a degree in English literature? You're making no sense at all.

    <TEXT>Right, so I'm a (pretty poor) filmmaker and I've finally decided to make the jump from premiere Pro cs5 to the up to date version of creative cloud. I've been editing on my Mac book for some years now but I never released how ancient it was until it said I couldn't download creative cloud because I don't have the latest version of OS and I can't get that cos the my Mac is from 2009. I've also always wanted to be able to play games on my laptop, something that was very difficult on Mac. Nothing major like the new battlefield or anything, literally just things like civ 5 and Skyrim with a few mods, maybe the new mount and blade if it ever comes out. So basically I need a laptop that can be used for editting, using the up to date versions of Adobe creative cloud and something that can play some pretty dated games smoothly. My budget is  #163;400, please help me out I already paid for Adobe like a tit.</TEXT>

I think with bannerlord tho we've seen so much of the game that we pretty much know exactly what to expect when it comes out as the dev blogs have basically took us through the game step by step.

One of the main themes of the game is how the US government and large corporations are the real mass murderers, however they hide behind the idea that they are righteous as they're not as openly violent as something like dutch's gang. They will do and kill anything for more money land and power because that was how America was built, it's ultimately Dutch's character arc that sees him go down a similar route from robin hood esq to power mad murderer.</TEXT>

Ive loved nearly every bethesda game I've played but they've taken a dramatic turn in the past couple of years and if they follow that trend I'm scared for their up coming releases. I'm sure it'll still be a good game but in terms of how it'll run when it's released/hidden costs etc it's anyone's guess. Though fallout 76 might just be the way it is because it's a multiplayer game rather than the standard single player game they normally release.

    <TEXT>So I'm finally making the move from Mac to pc, I'm looking to get the Acer Aspire e 15 8th gen i7 core laptop. I'm not entirely savvy with specs however so I'm just wondering if it (from what we know or just from guessing) will be able to run bannerlord when it comes out in 2050. I've read every Dev blog as they've been released but I'm not sure if they've ever hinted at what specs are required. I'm getting this laptop with the intention of editing videos as its my job, so having it run games is just a bonus and not a requirement. Before you ask I've been playing warband on console (sorry) but I've been really invested in this game since forever...basically I'm not a total noob, just really stupid when it comes to pc.

But yeah I'm pretty happy just playing older games on Steam, taleworlds announced ages ago that they'll be a console release for bannerlord and apparently it'll be coming out the same time as it's pc release (which I honestly doubt). I just wanted to play around with mods but I'll be more than happy with the base game on console. Might just play warband with mods instead as I'm really not looking for a gaming heavy laptop.

    <TEXT>Hi, thanks again for the reply, however I've only just realised that this model seems to be sold in the US only, I can get one here in the UK but I won't be entitled to any warranty. I've done some research and found the Acer Aspire 5 to be the alternative. The specs seem pretty much identical and it's also cheaper. I just have to ask however whether there is any difference that I should be aware of, it still has an mx 150 gpu, link below, thanks https://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/acer-aspire-5-a515-52-15-6-intel-core-i7-laptop-256-gb-ssd-silver-10188867-pdt.html</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Video editing desktop buying advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-08 09:52:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi I'm looking to buy a desktop primarily to smoothly run Adobe creative cloud, mainly premiere pro and after effects. I'm not hugely savvy with computers at all so I'm not looking to build one. I looked everywhere for a laptop but came to the conclusion that a desktop would just be better. My price range is around  #163;800 and I am in need of something that can be delivered in the UK and will have warranty in the UK. I don't know if there's a sperate sub for desktop buying advice, so apologies if there is. But if anyone can help and point me in the right direction that would be grand. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right I don't know if this has happened to any of you but on my most recent play through swadia has lost their shit. I started out without being from noble birth and just played as a mercenary for swadia for a bit until the butterlord asked me to be a lord to which I accepted. I then realised that they do not need my help at all and within, I wanna say barely 100 games days the rhodoks were gone, completely wiped off the map. I've never played a game where a faction is destroyed and I wasn't responsible. Like I had very little influence over the rhodok war cos I've been pissing about doing tournaments cos I'm broke as shit. Has this happened to anyone else, I can't seem to keep up with them and worried about when I have to separate from them they'll be too strong to repel. The sarranids have just declared war and we've taken shariz within the first 5 minutes.</TEXT>

Are they not letting people capture the single player gameplay? Just thought there would be more like there was last year. Also are there anymore scheduled interviews/showcases for the rest of the event? I've basically been refreshing the YouTube search more or less every hour (it's my day off ok).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is there very little media coverage of mount and blade?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-02 12:01:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I say media I'm talking about YouTubers, companies like ign, game informer etc, not the actual news or mass advertising. I find it weird that there's only, in reality, two maybe three YouTubers that actually get a semi decent amount of views when it comes to bannerlord videos. I understand that mount and blade series don't do too well because honestly it's an incredibly boring game to watch someone else play, that and because if I'm being brutally honest a lot of YouTubers that make m amp;b series rarely cut the videos down and they just don't have the personality to gather a large following. I'm just confused as to why there's really very little coverage on the build up to bannerlord, a lot of gaming journalist companies would have done small featuretes now that we have an EA date. But instead we get a 7 min gameplay from ign and our annual PCgamer article. Do Taleworlds not really care for funding advertising? Just think it would be nice if bannerlord is the one that brings in a lot of new players, like it's great that there's a pretty tight knit community, but still I want to see this franchise expand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What's also possible is having Corbyn as a caretaker PM supported by the SNP so long as he can get the Lib Dems and the independent party on his side. And he'd just act as PM until brexit is over and then we'd have yet another general election. But it's gonna be hard for him to get the independent party on his side as they originally formed as a result of labour MPs disagreeing with Corbyns leadership. Basically, as usual with British politics, no one fuckin knows what's gonna happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Talking from the UK perspective here where only specialist officers carry guns, so most bobby's that are sent to a situation are only carrying tasers or a baton. I watched this video and thought that it wasn't AS bad as the headline would have you think. However, over here a cops first line of defense is themselves rather than a gun. They're also trained essentially to be social workers in a way, so that they can assess a situation and see whether somebody isn't thinking in their normal state of mind and try to calm them down before taking physical action. And if that doesn't work they'd either taser (only if necessary) or tackle them to the ground. Now the cops in the video of this article could've easily done that, there were two of them, the guy was unarmed and he was intoxicated with his hands in the air. I'm not trying to shit on the US police and just big up the UK police, but it's clear that our policing cultures and training are vastly different. Your cops have guns, and with that it often seems to be the easy option, because in a moment's notice they can take down a perp and solve the problem. There's a quick video here where it shows the lengths unarmed cops have to go to in order to take someone down but either way I still fully support it because it's not risking a human life. https://youtu.be/9mzPj_IaMzY</TEXT>

I've played quite a few mods but for some reason, with all its popularity I've never played PoP. So I played for around 40 in game days yesterday, obviously not enough to have a real opinion on the game, but I just want to know what's the hype around it? What specific features sets it apart from other mods, don't get me wrong it's not as if I'm not enjoying it, I'm just not entirely sure how I should be playing it. Also some tips for a first time player would be helpful as well, how do you stop heretics attacking you every 15 minutes?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's more to do with the auto resolve between ai lords, specifically what I'm not sure. I saw someone else say that it's because when a lord gets defeated they have to run back to their keep alone so very often get captured by looters, which I have seen happen a lot. Once this happens they're out of the game for a while meaning they can't reinforce other lords, also means their money gets taken and they can't afford more troops. It seems that if this happens just a few times to a faction they snowball and just get steam rolled by everyone else. The thing you said about the battanians isn't so much a problem. Their place in the game is supposed to be the underdog, they're supposed to stay in their native land and be very hard to invade, but pretty terrible to play as if you want to conquer. If you were to take the battle to them on their home turf it'll be a lot harder to run rings around them with cavalry in mountains and forest. It's weird because on my playthrough they conquered half the world too, that's why I'm thinking it's partly to do with auto resolve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right so I've come to realise that there's no specialist infantry unit with any of the factions. By specialist I mean the top top tier unit with a faction that you can only level up from certain recruits that are quite rare. So the valandians have the banner knight, the empire the cataphract, the battanians the fian champion etc. What's weird is that all of these top units are cavalry except for battania who have archers. I thought that sturgia would at least have some op infantry kinda like how the nords had the huskals in warband. Also all the standard top tier units throughout each faction have the same stats. Is this just for EA to manage balancing for the time being? Because you can't see the stats for troop armour, you can only assume that all top tier standard troops are exactly the same throughout each faction</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ennit. Luckily it doesn't seem (for me) to be a specific kingdom that dominates. In my first play through the battanians did really well only to be swallowed entirely by the northern empire along with everyone else. The khuzaits were the first to go in that one. And now in my second playthrough the battanians did pretty well but it was the khuzaits who have now dominated. Made the game pretty interesting cos I'm playing as valandia and the war with battania was bloody hard and felt like an earned victory when we finally finished them, but that was mainly to do with the khuzaits helping. Now the khuzaits are at war with us and we're pretty fucked. I pushed back about 5 600 man armies in the first two days of the war and they keep coming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use these guys too. Only specialist unit that isn't cavalry. Best tactic is to get these dudes on a hill, have a line of legionaries, or any infantry that can form a shield wall/hold back enemy infantry for even a short amount of time. Then with your cavalry go behind the enemy as they advance, don't charge, the enemy will turn to face your cavalry and expose their backs to your archers. Once they lose formation and begin to charge regardless send in you infantry to attack them from behind, pull the cav back to get a good run at them, by now the enemy will be facing your infantry, so send your cav to charge, taking the enemy from behind twice. I've won battles where I'm outnumbered 5 to 1 on realistic with very minimal casualties and won battles where I'm outnumbered almost 10 to 1 on easy using this strategy.</TEXT>

This is my second playthrough and taleworlds have released a few snowball patches as I've played, but it was about two thirds of the way through khuzaits mad expansion so it slowed them down but didn't diminish their power. I've had fun organising and overhauling valandia as an Alexander the Great like general. The war has been hard af but we've managed to take all of battanias old land parts of sturgia and parts of the western empire.

    <TEXT>I think based on the real history time period bannerlord gets inspiration from, the English inspired faction should be a late Anglo Saxon faction. Would make sense with th vlandians being normans. Only thing I'd really disagree with is the Russian empire, as it would really be a mix of kievian rus, mongolian and at a push the kingdom of Novgorod. Other than that though the map looks great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dunno, feels very much like 11th century to me, 9th century at the very latest. The empire is more Byzantine than Roman. The vlandians being norman also fits in with this. And I feel battania is more inspired from welsh kingdoms of the time rather than out right Celtic tribes. The games start date is also an indication to the period just as how warbands was. And the game is said to be set 200 years before warband. I'd like to see them add city state factions that tend to remain neutral rather than out right large kingdoms, maybe they can work similar to how they worked in Civ 5 where they fund different factions and having them on your side is very beneficial, but out right invading them will cause a large amount of controversy with other factions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Dev blog actually confirms that the empire is based off the Byzantine empire and that the vlandians are based off the normans. The vlandians in the game do not seem like tribes. They have well built and maintained settlements, system of lords and a pretty standard feudalistic government not to mention their own norman inspired art work in their keeps. Rollo first settled in Normandy in 918, the vlandians are a much more developed form of the Normans. Just because the holy Roman empire doesn't have an inspired faction in the game doesn't mean the game isn't set during that period. The fact that the empire has just broken up also doesn't exactly indicate to the 5th century. The Roman empire as well as the byzantine empire went through countless civil wars. And in terms of equipment, the empire uses crossbows that are far more advanced than 5th century crossbows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This does annoy me tbf. Both sides of my grandparents moved to the UK from Ireland so both my parents grew up in an Irish household, despite being born in England they were still considered Irish. Much like someone who's grandparents are born in Pakistan is still considered Pakistani, because of the colour of their skin despite being all together culturally English. So I have a very Irish first and last name, not to mention I just look all together Irish and even have ginger pissin side burns. I find it so weird that the most I get is people in jest saying I'm a drunk or saying my name in a comical accents like I'm some sort of mythical creature (just as side note, this doesn't offend me in anyway any most of the time I take the piss out of myself for it, I also consider myself English rather than Irish at the risk of being called a "plastic paddy"). That compared to my parents upbringing is so starkly different. My dad recalls about living in Birmingham during the pub bombings and his teachers racially abusing him just because he was the Irish scapegoat, my uncles getting chased down by protestants for no other reason other than to beat the shit out of or kill some Catholics, my grandad remembers pubs having "no blacks no dogs no irish" signs on their doors and all together my family being treated like second class citizens, not being able to find work because of their surname or not being able to associate with families etc. I just find it crazy how in the course of about 20 years the British outlook on the Irish has gone from scary dirty racially inferior terrorists to happy little munchkin people who love a good drink. It's just reflective of how the British public are so driven by what tabloid newspapers tell them, there always has to be another scapegoat for us to hate, before it was the Irish and now it's Muslims.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go on gameplay on the options menu and there's a few boxes, one of them says "show friendly banners" or something like that and just untick it. Can feel a bit weird at first, like I did it just to make one battle look cool and then I forgot to tick it again but just ended up getting used to it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-11 00:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just want to know whether it's worth starting a new game just yet. I'm on my second play through, both times the snowball bug basically irradicated all the factions all bar one or two and ruined the game. Though my current play through I've enjoyed as I decided to stick with vlandia to push back the khuzaits to the point where we now own most of the map, but it's getting to be a bit of a stale mate. With the new patches, if I restart now will I just have another situation like this or will the other factions actually last longer than a year?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've noticed that with my current one. Like we've actually started winning mainly due to me organising the fuck out of the vlandians and convincing enemy lords to join us, but the reason for the stalemate is cos the khuzait seem to have every mercenary band on their side. They relentlessly raid villages and take poorly defended castles. I swear their armies just seem to regenerate out of thin air too. I think I fight more mercs than lords most of the time, it's pretty op. But I reckon that should be the case I suppose, the faction with the most money can hire the more armies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dunno if it's been mentioned cos I haven't seen it. But just before the 1.1 update, a load of new companions were added. Specifically ones with specialist abilities, so there are now engineer companions and ones that specialise in stewarding. Just go on the encyclopedia, click on heroes, then wanderer and then you can track them down. A lot of you probably know this already but this is for those who don't.</TEXT>

There's the Triarri, which is an imperial unit and they look cool af plus are super powerful. However they're a special unit for a minor faction so the only way to recruit them is to win a battle against said faction, take the units as prisoners and then wait for them to join your army.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Completely agree with this. For me it's the recognition aspect of the game though. So on my second playthrough I started it before the snowball patches which meant that a few years in the only kingdoms remaining were the battanians who owned a huge amount of land, the khuzaits who owned even more and vlandia who had only their original territory, so wanting a challenge I joined vlandia. Not only did I almost single handedly organise their lords and armies into a coordinated force, but I crushed the battanians, which left the even bigger threat of the khuzaits who had 3 times our combined strength and contolled 3 quarters of the map. Yet I managed to defeat and execute monchug, convince lords to join our cause, gave derhert the bloody dragon banner and eventually after god knows how many hours of gameplay, conquer the entire map with me in some way being responsible for near enough every fief we captured. Yet I came out of it with three fuckin towns. I had 100 relation with almost every lord on our side, as well as derhert. I wanted to be treated differently, as in I want people to see me as the saviour of the kingdom, lords and families to try and get close to me, enemy lords to be terrified of facing me. Why the hell was derhert giving fiefs to lords who defected to the vlandians and who had done nothing towards the war effort as opposed to those who had been their since the beginning and basically won the war? Don't get me wrong I love this game, I've got about 170 hours on it and that's something I rarely do and I know it's in early access but I really hope they expand on interactions with lords, I wanna feel like I've had an impact on the world, not just "oh I heard to took dick head castle, nice job", yeah I also toppled the biggest empire the world has ever known.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to get lords to defect and keep their fiefs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-24 00:11:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right so I've started my first play through where I intend to be king (I didn't bother in my last one cos it was back when steam rolling was really bad so just stuck with an existing faction). I've put loads of xp into charm and got good relations with nearly everyone in vlandia, so when I form my own kingdom I assumed it would work like warband where you can convince lords to join you and they'd bring their fiefs with them. I've managed to convince 5 clans to join me now, all with a decent amount of land, yet only one of the fuckers held onto it. All the other lords seem to have just handed over their fiefs to their previous king. Is this a glitch? If not, why the hell is it a feature? One of my favourite aspects of warband was maxing out persuasion and feeling like a Machiavellian character when I get all the lord's to betray their king. Seriously cannot expect me to siege every damn castle in the game. Also what dumbass lord would take a massive risk joining another side but then leave all the power they had in the first place?</TEXT>

I remember the cavalry charge coming out the gate and the attacker army scrabbling to the siege engines. The cavalry basically destroyed the battering ram and damaged the tower and then quickly retreated back into the walls before the attacking army could fully mobilise. Don't know if this is from back when it was a completely different engine they were working with though</TEXT>

But when a game or any media takes a specific historical route I feel that have at least some responsibility to educate, unless it's purposefully made to parody or use the setting as a mere back drop for a story, e.g. tarrantino films, comedies etc. I can normally look past armour and weapon choices in games, but the big fucker that stuck out to me from the new AC is making my boy Alfred the Great the villain. Dude shouldn't apologise for kicking out a bunch of raping and pillaging invaders. Not to mention how he reformed education, paved the way for the creation of England, essentially created a navy and fortified the borders. He's the only English monarch to hold the title of the Great for a reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea of the Spanish inquisition being like a renaissance SS is also that of a myth. They would give fair warning and provide warrants before they would come to your house to question you, (so people always expected the Spanish inquisition) if you were charged with anything you would appear in front of a court and face a trial rather than being immediately sentenced upon questioning as many believe. Throughout the some 200 year period of the Spanish inquisition roughly about 5000 were ever executed (still up for debate) which is nothing compared to the millions people claim. The reason we believe this is due to British and other protestant nation propaganda that tried to deface the Catholic church. There's no denying that the inquisition was fundamentally wrong but the fact that the propaganda of 600 odd years ago remains to be the current entry level knowledge of the inquisition is scary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what I don't get about the US. Every time there's an issue, a protest or a political opinion no matter how sensitive, there is always people how oppose said issue in the...I dunno simplistic way. Ok so let's just say the right wing, in their opinion oppose the BLM protests as they don't believe the police abuse power etc etc, fair enough, feel free to exercise that opinion, I disagree with you, but you're taking away the message of the protests and forming an opinion. So why are these people countering BLM protests by glorifying George Floyd's death? It's like they think that BLM are protesting because GF death was sad and they're essentially saying, hey we don't think his death was sad, let's protest. It's so weirdly grotesque, this lack of empathy and solidarity, I'm sorry to say, seems to happen in the US a lot. Like the countless school shootings, some people don't make it an argument about gun ownership, but instead an argument about "yes those kids should have died and the people protesting should also be shot". Why are people protesting the cause and not the message. It's like running into a burning building to extinguish the match that started it rather than bother with the actual fire. (Bad analogy as it makes the protestors look like the bad guys, but you get what I mean). I dunno I just really really don't get that county sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah sorry I didn't intend to generalise, I know they're not all nutters. Interesting your point about your family though because that's what I find weird. So I'm from the UK and generally when something bad but politically dividing happens, such is the case with George Floyd, people tend to tread carefully. So everyone in the media or generally people you meet, whether they agree with it or not, are generally like "yeah what happened was awful", and then they'd go on to disagree with say the looting or some other aspect, never the person who lost their life. Good example is Jade Goodie, a reality TV star who was continuously shit on by the papers and just about everyone until she got cancer and the media basically documented every aspect of her life until she died and then held her in the same light as a saint despite shitting on her for years before hand. Everyone who hated her before hand didn't dare speak out against her. Now I'm not necessarily saying this is a good thing, that's a particularly bad example and more of an example of how shit the British tabloids are. But people laid into the tabloids for this reason as opposed to laying into jade goodie. I dunno, here people seem faster to address the bigger issue rather than the catalyst. And I know in the US it is a very very small select few who do shit like attack someone's character in the wake of their murder and I know most people do address the bigger picture, but it's still the fact that there ARE people who do what these guys are doing in the article that baffles me. I'm not trying to shit on your country, believe me, I'm just as fast to lay into the UK, I'm just fascinated by these people ngl.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ennit. Like I'm not from the US and I'm as anti trump as they come but the prospect of him losing is pretty terrifying. I mean obviously it's better in the long term, but I'm genuinely concerned about a wave of violence that could erupt, that the country hasn't seen in modern times. Trump supporters always want to believe one conspiracy theory or the other which will make them feel absolutely justified in committing violent acts. I hope to god I'm wrong but with tensions between race and ideology atm has caused so many people on either side of the fence to arm themselves, so the fuel is there, it just needs a match.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I work in a pub and I'm being called back to work for training tomorrow and then a shift Sunday. And personally I think it's a terrible idea. Just to be clear our pub has had medical experts in throughout lockdown and the rules the staff now have to follow seems to be as strict as a bloody hospital. Full PPE, clean every surface every 30 minutes, one way system, qr codes at the table to order food, no bar service etc, etc. However not all pubs will have the funding to do this, we are a chain, and a very profitable one at that, we have the ability to pull in experts and have a flashy training course. Yet on an average Sunday we'd have no more than 9 staff members in, this Sunday we have 17. We'd have around 250 bookings all day (restaurant too), this Sunday we have over 300. I live in an area that could potentially go into another lockdown and I live with two people who come under the high risk category. Another guy I work with is a full time carer for his grandad whom he lives with, his grandad has to shelter. They've said to both of us "we have hours to give you so you can no longer be furloughed". I appreciate that they've been given the go ahead by the government, but I personally do not feel safe going back to work. The alternative? I don't have job. Its not going back to work that bothers me, I trust the staff I work with, customers however are unpredictable and 300 people in at once in a very popular pub that's opening for the first time in how many months, what could possibly go wrong? We've got a rule that says tables of 6 or more have to be from no more than 2 households. How the fuck do you enforce those kind of rules? What's the point in having a rule if you can't enforce it? Am I supposed to pull everyone's utility bills at the door?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fun fact: it was FDR who refused to shake Jesse Owens' hand at the Olympics, not Hitler. Hitler only shook the hands of German athletes. Owens went on to say "While at the Olympic Games, I had the opportunity to meet the King of England. I had the opportunity to wave at Hitler, and I had the opportunity to talk with the King of Sweden, and some of the greatest men in Europe. Some people say Hitler snubbed me. But I tell you, Hitler didn't snub me #8212;it was our president who snubbed me. The president didn't even send me a telegram. I am not knocking the President. Remember, I am not a politician. But remember that the President did not send me a message of congratulations because people said he was too busy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For starters globalisation was inevitable and had been on the rise before the second world war. It's what in fact caused the great depression to impact the world economy as opposed to just one nation. The great depression, was a result of US greed and lack of foresight that led to the Japanese holding the US responsible and thus declaring war. But I'm not here to point fingers about an economic crisis from nearly 100 years ago. The age of piracy had long since ended after the use of iron cladded ships, trade between countries separated by an ocean had gone on relatively unhindered for a long time. It was, as you could imagine, the advancements of technology that pushed forward globalisation. No one nation can be held responsible for this, the US, France, Germany, Britain and countless others were all contributing to these advancements, it's called globalisation for god's sake, one nation can't achieve that. Now let's move onto the blame game. Yes, every super power in history has committed atrocities, but that, right there, what you just said, is the most pathetic, simplistic and childish response to excuse the shit your nation is doing and I see the same excuse every damn day. I'm from the UK, the British empire has more blood on its hands than any. Do we teach enough about the crimes against humanity committed by the empire in schools? No. Somewhat, but all together, no. But the fact is people here are aware that we were shit, and to be honest, we're embarrassed and ashamed. Large parts of Africa are impoverished or a warzone as a result of British intervention from a hundred years ago. Does our government help? No. I, as someone from the UK accept the fact that my country has done awful things and is run by a bunch of incompetent ignorant cunts. So when I say this to you, I want you to know, this isn't about feeling better about my own country, nor about comparing them. I am not a representative of the UK, every single one of my ancestors were Irish and moved here in the 70s on both sides of my family, so this isn't going to be a "you should repent for the things your ancestors did" thing either, cos I think that's stupid. With that being said, you are not a representative of the USA so I don't hold you responsible for any of the things I'm about to say. What I am saying however is you need to accept the facts and stop following blind nationalism as the 1930s and 1940s can tell you, it never ends well. The fact is that the US have committed crimes against humanity, toppled governments in democratic nations and replaced them with tyrants, stole land, forced starvation, caused untold amounts of environmental damage, caused people's homelands to be inhabitable from nuclear testing, committed countless warcrimes, murdered civilians on purpose, funded criminals and drug lords to cripple economies and spread corruption, experimented on civilians in foreign countries, successfully and unsuccessfully carried out hundreds of assassination attempts on foreign soil, desecrated bodies and then pardoned the soldiers responsible, carried out false flag offensives as a reason to declare war, destabilised the entire middles east, funded terrorists and with that giving birth to terrorist organisations such as the Taliban and much more. And that's on even touching upon what they've done upon their own people. So let's talk about segregation, targeted evacuations in natural disasters so to leave black communities to die (Katrina), experimenting on their own troops with agent orange, experimenting on their own population with radiation and deadly bacteria, genocide and land seizure of natives, creating a frontline of black infantry in the army in order to lower the population, pandering to big corporations despite unethical conduct think Flint Michigan, pandering to the NRA and allowing gun control to go unchecked while putting a political spin on anti-gun as wholly unpatriotic and unamerican, allowing groups like the KKK to even exist, law enforcement taking the form of an unchecked military, racial provoked murders and even lynchings going unchecked, unprecedented racial prejudice that is just as precedent today as it was 50 years ago, spending hundreds of billions on a military when children can't even afford school meals and having a healthcare system that's so out of control it costs $300 for one stitch. Now what's the difference between that and other world powers? It's happening right now or it's still within living memory. I haven't even listed current events that have happened under trump. I am someone who believes counties should be held somewhat accountable for things they did in the past, more over I think it should be the duty of the state to educate a populace on such things. However, if something is current and happening in your life time or even your parents life time, it is your duty to fight it and preach it. Do I expect you to storm into Congress? Hell no. But stop acting like a child and using the same excuse of "well he did it first". What the world considers immoral has changed from the time of the empires, yet the US is still acting like one. Take some responsibility and fuckin fight to end this shit. The only person who sounds like a crybaby is you and the millions of other Americans who blindly don't ever question their government but always scream about their rights, even though their rights are being stripped from under their noses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Always liked the idea of natural civil wars as opposed to the scripted ones in warband (usurper quest). More so I'd like to see a civil war mechanic within clans. If the previous king has multiple children then they could declare war on each other if they feel that they were cheated of their inheritance. Even more interesting would be if they improve the way relationships work, so the player can have an influence on how their children interact with each other. If you die and your children hate each other, the one you choose to be your successor could see their brothers/sisters declare war on them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean I do agree, but 2 years is still far too short. I've barely finished trading at that point. I don't mind so much two of them collapsing but there should be at least one that absorbs most of the others territory. It always annoys me how op battania are in all my playthroughs though, we were led to believe that they were the underdogs of the game. I think it would be much better if they were awful at expansion, but one of the hardest to invade due to how fortified their settlements are and how good they are at guerilla warfare etc. In many of my playthroughs battania are the most powerful faction after the khuzaits. I think balancing all together need to be fixed, this game is designed to be played for the long haul but your forced to choose a side very early on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Way back when bannerlord was in early development (as in like 5 years after they announced it was in development), they said that there was a town/castle building mechanic which they later scrapped. Basically how it worked was like in warband where you can be lord of a singular village as opposed to being lord of a castle and it's accompanying villages. With that village you could then build structures, businesses, mines, then eventually walls and turn it into a castle and then after that you could upgrade it to a town. There wasn't the addition of small levels of detail like you mentioned but still thought it sounded like a cool idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bar staff here. So we've been taking "every precaution", but you are absolutely right it is all pr. So we're wearing visors, have no bar service, having customers take drinks off trays etc etc. But we're not limiting how many come in, we're busier now than before lockdown. The rules that staff had to follow amongst each other disappeared within a week of opening, partly because they did add a lot of time to our work flow but also because we only follow certain rules so customers thing we're trying, not because we actually want to be safe. However customers don't follow the rules at all no matter how hard you try to enforce them. If you want to know how bad it all is, someone I work with was still asked to come in after one of their household members had been working around 5 people who had tested positive. They went and got a test and were told they still have to come to work before they got their results. Went an entire shift without people knowing whether or not they had it or not. It's also worrying how many people you thought were normal or at least well educated that are believing in conspiracy theories. I have a manager who is anti mask and catches the bus everyday and thinks the whole thing is a hoax. I've tried as hard as possible to stay safe as I live with my parents who could potentially fit into the vulnerable category. However it's impossible to feel safe in that environment, I would quit but it would be stupid to give up any source of income in this climate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, at the risk of sounding very impatient, what's the deal with modding tools atm? I felt that once they dropped, nexus and moddb would be flooded with mods (obviously I'm not talking about complete overhauls, but something more like a new battlefield map), but so far there's nothing new at all. Again I'm not complaining nor being impatient but genuinely intrigued as to why. I did download the modding tools just to have a look but I have 0 experience or knowledge of modding so it's kinda wasted on me, though I have heard people voicing their complaints so just wanted to know what the current issue is.</TEXT>

Okay, it seems to be a common occurrence that people write an essay on their requests for the game, so here I am, having written an essay on my requests for the game. Quick disclaimer, I love this game, I fully support the developers, many of these points are a message to modders rather than the devs, as some of these things may deviate from the games core values/style. This isn #8217;t a criticism by any means, just a list of ideas that I #8217;ve been noting down since release. I #8217;ve got nearly 500 hours in this game and I #8217;m a firm believer in  #163;1=1 hour of gameplay, other currencies are available. But for real, this is like 4000 words long, I put less effort into some of my uni projects, so would appreciate feedback from anyone and everyone. **Changes to AI** **Relation per individual** There should be two types of relationship metres: one representing the clan and one representing the individual. Basically, you should be able to have different relationships between each individual noble even if they are in the same clan. You would build/diminish you relationship with each individual the same way you would anyway (assuming we finally see relationship changes from fighting battles with lords), however that change in relationship would apply to the individual in question, rather than their clan as a whole, this would still have some affect on family relations though. How it would work is; the overall clan relationship would signify the bond between two houses, as opposed to you and the entire family, this would be a combination of each clan members relationship towards your family, with the clan leader having the largest amount of influence on this number. So you could have a strong personal relationship with a clan leader, this would make for a strong clan relationship between your families; however you could have a terrible relationship with their heir, so when the current leader dies and their heir replaces them you could see a large diminish in your clan alliance, this would work both ways, say if you die and your heir takes over. This would make for a more interesting AI and it would not be specific just to the player, as AI lords would interact with each other in this way too, making for a more natural and constant shift within political spheres. **Visible relation vs hidden relation** Building upon the last idea, there should be visible and secret relations. This is just a rough idea so feedback would be welcome, but generally speaking when a clan defects from your kingdom it rarely feels like a betrayal as 90% of the time you can see it coming as you either have poor relations with them or they have really good relations between the other monarch. I would like to see real blood boiling betrayals in the game, so some sort of secret relation bar could be implemented that exist purely in the game files so the player can #8217;t see them. Nobles who are particularly devious would work to befriend you in order to receive higher positions of power only to betray you or even usurp/stage a coup later down the line. This will add a new dynamic to the so far very predictable AI, leave the player questioning their allegiances and make the AI more human. **Wars and feuds between lords** I think this would work particularly with Vlandia, a Norman inspired faction who #8217;s king, Derhert, is said to have spent most of his time putting down petty squabbles. This sounds like the tumultuous times after the Norman conquest of England, especially during the reign of Stephen which saw the  #8216;Anarchy #8217;. There was a period which was essentially a free for all between English barons battling each other with little to no intervention from the crown. It would be interesting to see this in the game, not just in Vlandia, but across the board. This could happen as a result in diminishing influence of the ruling faction, a destabilising economy or just based on certain policies that reduces the faction leaders #8217; powers over their nobles. However, these wouldn #8217;t be classified as all out civil wars, more petty conflicts. **Organise rebellion with other lords** As simple mechanic for organising rebellions or even a peaceful coup. You should be able to secretly conspire with other nobles to rebel against a monarch, it never made sense to me that you #8217;d just have to assume you #8217;d receive support once you desert a kingdom, why would any irl risk it? Instead you should slowly, over time, open up ideas to nobles about a rebellion (roguery and charm skills will come into play) until you feel ready to finally openly ask them if they #8217;d support you if you were to usurp the throne. If they agree then they will immediately join you when you form your own kingdom (or better still when there #8217;s the option to become leader of a pre-existing faction). This way you don #8217;t have to faff around searching for the nobles in question as soon as you leave a kingdom. This should however come with risks. Should you fail to convince a lord they may report you to the current monarch who may declare war on you for treason. **People remember battles and create songs** Two small immersive additions to the game, don #8217;t know if it would really come under AI, but oh well. NPC #8217;s remembering and naming large, and more importantly, significant/campaign changing battles would make for a dynamic and memorable experience. The concept of it is relatively simple, however in practise I imagine it could prove difficult. The game would decide and weigh up whether or not a battle is important; was it a clash between two main armies (or even multiple if a coalition between factions has been made)?, how many casualties?, how many combatants?, was it a close victory?, did one side defy all the odds?, did it turn the tables of the war?, was it between two bitter rivals or two good friends/family members? Then comes the part of naming the battle, most battles are named after their location. This would require the campaign map to have place names for each province, river, mountain and forest. Or the player can just decide the name of the battle if they were directly involved. Now comes the idea of having songs attached to them. This would work by having a set of prewritten songs, each culture having several, with blanks in the lyrics throughout which can be filled with the name of the battle, the name of nobles and who the victor was. Each will be configured so to cater to what kind of victory (or defeat) it was, whether it was won be crushing the enemy or won by superior use of tactics while being outnumbered. It could go as far as each faction having their own song about the battle, one celebrating it and one mourning it. Even more ambitious would be to have all the lines of dialogue recorded so each possible variation of the song could be played in the game. If not the tune of the song can be played by bards in the halls and taverns, this could also act like a boost to your influence and popularity (or unpopularity based upon the outcome of the battle in question) with the people. Extremely ambitious I know but a nice idea. **True evil NPCs** I want to see some truly sadistic evil bastards, some Ramsey Bolton, Emperor Nero type characters. These could be predetermined in some characters at the start of the game, but most monsters are created. I #8217;d like to see NPC #8217;s develop character traits based on their experiences, especially in their early life. If you #8217;re (or any other NPC for that matter) a bad parent towards your child; you beat them, neglect them, don #8217;t spend time teaching them or have a spouse who has poor character traits, then that child could grow up to be a monster. Yes, you will have full control over one of your offspring once you die, but the others will keep these traits. This could lead to sibling rivalry and even civil war. This should also introduce a new trait which makes nobles and the public fear you. Ruling through fear should have different benefits and downsides to ruling through love/inspiration, but to be honest I haven #8217;t thought it through enough. **Torture** With there being evil NPC #8217;s, there should be a way to exercise their sadistic nature and give nobles both friend and foe the reason to fear them. Torture would become an option once you capture a noble, there may be several options with lead to different outcomes. It may be a way to reveal sensitive information about the enemy #8217;s war plans, or find incriminating and embarrassing gossip about nobles or kings that can be used in smear campaigns. Or it can be used to break someone #8217;s will (they may be psychologically damaged afterwards and flee from battles more often and get a reputation for having a nervous temperament so are less likely to inspire their peers), torture could end up reducing skill points and removing perks from certain trees, particularly physical attributes (athletics, one handed, bow etc), or it can make someone infertile. This can happen to you as a player too if you are caught by an evil NPC. Whether you reveal information to your torturer would be based on your charm skill. Torturing would of course massively damage your honour and relationship #8217;s with other nobles. However different factions will have different opinions about it; Battania may openly accept it and even encourage it, Vlandia would oppose it due to chivalry, the Empire would be in the middle as they believe only imperials should be treated with rights, yet they want to keep their civilised reputation. **People treat you based on policy** Pretty simple really, people should speak to you in a different manner based on what kind of leader you are. If you #8217;ve introduced Sacred Majesty people should treat you like a god appointed monarch, more grovelling and bowing (for the love of god allow us and other NPC #8217;s to bow). Would like to make a point about how each policy should generate a visual difference in the game, serfs see more people in villages, citizens see more in towns etc, this has been mentioned before by others so I won #8217;t go into it. **Different leadership per kingdom** Again, something that #8217;s been mentioned in the past, just want to reiterate it though. Factions shouldn #8217;t all be the same with different skins, there should be a complex level of structural hierarchy for each faction based on the cultures they are trying to mirror. With that policies shouldn #8217;t be just a matter of changing numbers, but a significant overhaul to a faction. Senate especially needs to significantly change a faction, an actual scene where you can attend a senate house and vote on subjects (not just policies), senators aren #8217;t just AI nobles either but significant landlords and merchants from each town/castle. But again, others have provided more detailed ideas on this previously. **AI/CAMPAIGN** **Battanian Overhaul** So branching off on factions, I feel Battania needs a complete overhaul. I know snowballing has been a persistent problem in the game and TW have done a lot to curb that but it #8217;s still not fully fixed, which again is fine because I know it #8217;s one of their priorities. However, I have experienced Battania snowballing every now and again and IMO I think that out of all the factions, they should receive the most significant overhaul. They are essentially a late Celtic faction based off the Welsh. Now the Welsh could and did build a hell of a lot of castles and very formidable ones at that (if you ever go it is worth visiting a few because there #8217;s loads that are still in pretty good condition). However, Battania do not represent that time period in Welsh history, most of, if not all, of their towns and castles are occupied old Imperial settlements. When I initially saw the dev blog about Battania I thought of them to be the true underdog of the game, but they #8217;re not. They should act like a loose confederation of petty clans who prioritise raiding over conquering. Their main goal should be to defend their land that they #8217;re so scared of losing. Looting and sacking of towns and castles needs to be implemented so to allow this to work. Moreover, a guerrilla warfare mechanic needs to be introduced to allow them to do this. They need to be a faction that can #8217;t support a large conquest, but are damn near impossible to invade, but more importantly, hard to subdue once you have conquered them. Look to my ambushes and roads section of how this can be fleshed out some more. Their lands should have more roaming bands of raiders that aren #8217;t affiliated with the Battanian faction, but will only attack foreign invaders and occasionally raid bordering villages, but leave Battanian villagers alone. The hilly and forest landscape should play massively to their advantage, atm forests are just a ball ache for everyone, especially archers, archers being Battania #8217;s best unit. And finally, I think Battanian cavalry shouldn #8217;t exist all together. Playing as Battania it should be possible to conquer but it should be the most challenging faction to do so and should require heavy reform in policy to allow them to become an empire (look at kingdom tiers). **Imperial lords not defecting to Battania** Speaks for itself really, always felt it to be a bit lore breaking. **Unstable succession** This is something I #8217;d love to see, it #8217;s a bit of a rarity in history that an heir ascends to the throne completely peacefully without at least one person claiming that the crown belongs to someone else. This would work well with the personal relation system that I mentioned at the start. So; siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles within the same clan/in-lore clan should all have personal relations between each other. Imagine a civil war starting out between two siblings as one believes that they are the real heir, this can work for both when monarchs die and when a clan leader dies. Nobles can pledge their allegiance to either candidate and receive rewards/punishment/pardoning based on whose side they chose when the war is over. Would work well with the evil NPC idea, and isn #8217;t exclusive to player succession, but for all kingdoms. **Bastards** Would work well with the previous idea. Not sure why you would choose to have an illegitimate child/what benefits it would have other than roleplaying purposes. Can either choose to disown them or take them into the family. **Hold court** Something I #8217;d like to see to help remove the repetitiveness of constant war and sieges. When you sit on your throne the option to hold court should come up, if you choose to do so then a line of notables, peasants, merchants etc will approach you and address you based on your rank (bow if monarch/related to royalty) and in real time tell you their problems and you will be tasked with deciding how to deal with said problem. These could be the quests in your holdings or just requests to bolster the number of soldiers in bandit afflicted areas or issues on tax etc **CAMPAIGN** **Different kingdom tiers** Along the lines of Total War Rome 2 where there were different levels to your empire. Holding lots of lands and commanding a lot of nobles should come with a risk of civil war, rife corruption etc. Different kingdom tiers should differentiate how you faction is managed, whether you #8217;re feudalistic, a democracy or an all-out empire. **Roads** Again, something that has been mentioned before, but it expands upon some of my previous ideas as well as the next one. Roads should play a much larger role in trade and warfare. Armies of say, more than 500, should not be allowed to deviate from the road, this means large armies must plan ahead when considering going on an offensive. It would call for a more logical and tactical approach from the player and the AI as both would have to calculate the best route in order to invade/predict where the enemy may invade from. This would also make invading Sturgia more of a challenge as there are only a few entry points into their territory. Smaller armies will be able to deviate from the roads, so smaller armies would have the benefit of mobility for scouting as well as the ability to deploy guerrilla warfare (look at ambushes next). Battania should have little to no roads, but more of a patch work of paths. Again, this would make invading them very hard, armies will still be able to move along these paths but at a much slower rate and the cultural perk for the Battanian #8217;s should be buffed so they can move easily along these paths. **Ambushes** Also, something that has been mentioned in the past but would just like to expand on it. Ambushes should be available for armies that aren #8217;t bound to a road, so maybe below 500 (just an estimate, I haven #8217;t put too much thought into the numbers). How it would work is; the player would find an area next to a road that has some sort of natural blind spot (forest/hills/mountains etc), setting up may take a set amount of in game time, this could be determined by the scouting or tactics skill. The player would then appear invisible to the enemy army which will carry on along the road, once the army reaches the player, they will have the option to engage or wait. If engage is selected the player will be taken onto the battle map, there will be a birds eye view similar to how a siege starts, here you will see the enemy army marching along the road in a column formation, still unaware of your presence. Assuming the  #8216;One Step Ahead #8217; perk is unlocked (or implemented) you are then able to place your troops along the flanks of the enemy allowing you to rain arrows down upon them from either side, or have your infantry/cav charge in a pincer move, or both. If you choose to retreat, you won #8217;t loose favour with anyone as the idea of an ambush isn #8217;t to irradicate the enemy army but to slow them down/lower their moral/cripple a portion of their army and supply line. However, once you retreat, if you engage the enemy again then they will be in full formation waiting for you. This would make Battania a formidable force to invade as they have a lot of forest to hide in. You could recreate the Battle of Pendraic. Imagine an army of 1000 imperials getting ripped up be a band of 100 Battanian archers shooting from the trees. This could completely change up your play style, you could become a Robin Hood type character, ambushing caravans or even armies and escaping into the forests or hills. No longer will the bigger army always win. This would work well in Sturgian territory too, with their mountains. **Share of wealth as empire expands** Pretty self-explanatory, when a faction starts to get larger, everyone should feel the benefit, not just the monarch. **ART** **Statues** Just a quick idea that I reckon shouldn #8217;t be too hard to implement. You should be able to have statues erected of your character in the main square of your town/castle. It would cost a lot of money however and can cause upset among the populace if they are suffering and you #8217;ve just spent their taxes on a vanity project. However if you are a truly just and worthy individual the statue can increase your influence. Statues can also be erected at a reduced rate after you die (again, if you were a good leader) and completely free if you were the greatest leader that faction had/founded the kingdom.**More castle interior** I know this is already in the works, but I #8217;d like to see more rooms in castles, giant corridors to explore, an entrance to the roof or balcony so I can over look my lands and a full entourage you #8217;d normally find in a castle.**Public execution, display body** Public executions of lords or criminals would help to instil loyalty or fear in the populace. It can either quell or insight a rebellion, so it must be used with caution. This should come with a full scene with a large crowd. You can choose to carry out the execution or allow a professional to do it. Still not sure what difference that would make but I dunno, I like the whole  #8216;the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword #8217; thing (could increase honour?). You can also choose to display the bodies (or heads rather) on the walls of you settlement, this again would increase your fear level. The option to send the remains of a lord back to their family should be an option, which can lower the relation penalty with that family. **COMBAT** **Choose troop culture from recruit** Each recruit will still be the same (imperial recruit, Vlandian recruit etc), but once you level them up to tier 2 then you should decide their culture, I mean you #8217;re the one training them and supplying the weapons and armour, why would a Vlandian train a Khuzait horse archer? The troops will still have the facial features of their original culture. However noble troops can only be found in their homeland. This is definitely more of a mod idea though, as it does defeat a core mechanic in the game. **Weather, wind direction** Weather is something that many have asked for and I can imagine will certainly make an appearance, I just have a few ways of adding to it. So rain will cause boggy battle fields making it harder for horses to move (battle of Agincourt gang) and slower travelling on the map, fog will reduce archers accuracy as well as it being unavailable to see the enemy formation when pressing alt until you are much closer, snow will reduce movement too and in extreme blizzards can kill troops on the campaign map. Finally, there #8217;s wind, the direction of which will greatly change the effectiveness and range of archers. You could shoot down wind and hit all of your targets from the bottom of a hill, whereas your enemy at the top could be out of range as they #8217;re shooting up wind (think Battle of Townton).**Bodyguards in towns** Pretty simple, if you #8217;re a noble or monarch, you should be entitled to have a few fully armoured bodyguards escort you around town. I have another quick addition to towns (which should have been in art but oh well), your army should be set up in tents just outside of the town, your troops should be in civilian clothes, eating food and drinking beer or whatever you have in your inventory, some may be in the tavern or wondering around town. This just adds to immersion.**Assassin's** Assassin #8217;s have been mentioned a hundred times, but yeah, they should be able to attack you in the streets, hence why bodyguards would be useful.**Empire has different noble units** Was a bit disheartened when I saw each empire faction had the same troops, I understand most of them being the same but was hoping for at least one variation in each. So I thing noble troops should be changed for each, the north should have a Sturgian inspired heavy infantry unit, based off the Varangian guards, the west should have cataphracts (a mix of Vlandian and Aserai inspired heavy cav) and for the south I was thinking maybe horse archers as they border with the Khuzait (forgot to mention that the bucellarii should be replaced with a light melee cav across all 3 empires), however the idea of two noble horse archer troop lines bothered me for some reason, so really open to ideas.**Wounded enemies on Battlefield** Troops who fall on the battlefield and are listed as wounded should have their own animation. They should lie of the ground reeling in pain. If the player chooses to, they can order their men to finish them off. Would be quite cool to see the aftermath of a battle where troops wonder solemnly around the bodies putting their swords through screaming soldiers. I do not mean it in a sick way #8230;more I want it to show the horror of war rather than a load of jolly moustache men cheering at the end, after seeing so much death. Obviously if you choose to kill them all, they will not be kept as prisoners and you could receive a small penalty to character traits if you persistently do it and build a reputation of taking no prisoners. This can only really happen at the end of the battle too as the wounded would most likely have to count towards the total number of troops on the battle. Thought I #8217;d leave this nugget of info at the bottom, but I #8217;m not a modder nor have any real knowledge abut game development, I #8217;m just a consumer with a few ideas. If some of these things aren #8217;t at all possible due to engine restrictions that is completely understandable. Again, these are ideas not demands, I am open to any and all suggestions.</TEXT>
