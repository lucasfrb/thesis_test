    <TEXT>It depends personally its about which one looks better and how well the spines hold up in those big version. In your case I would prefer deathnote to be singles and berserk even though It #8217;s new to me, the hardcovers are a lot better quality than the singles and feels like the best way to read it which is why I went with the hardcovers. (Gonna be a hard wait for the 3rd hardcover though :/ ) tbh though you aren #8217;t gonna miss out on anything so it #8217;s a preference thing.</TEXT>

On top of that berserks story is amazing from what I #8217;ve read so far. If price is an issue you can find them for like 30 bucks on amazon. Which is the price of two standard volumes of berserk. But the hardcovers look very nice and are well made. I recommend them 100% as a new berserk fan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im currently watching season 3 of the anime and am pretty close to starting part 4. I hear when the new director shows up, people think the show dips in quality. I myself have enjoyed the series so far but I notice in plate 4 the series dips in review. I'm hoping the series ends on a good note with me, but i'm worried Ill fall into place with what a lot of people think. Makes me sad cuz this show so far has been very good imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just finished vagabond and I still need to read the 11th volume of Vinland saga but from what I #8217;ve read I think Vinland saga is still the superior manga. Vagabond does feel like a serious manga though it can be very very slow during points. The art however is fantastic in vagabond but reading Vinland saga gave me a little bit little bit of everything. Great art, amazing story, violence, and a world I wanted to keep seeing. though it doesn #8217;t really matter which one you pick up they are both must haves in your collection in my opinion. Can #8217;t go wrong with either :)</TEXT>
