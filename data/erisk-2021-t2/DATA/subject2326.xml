    <TEXT>If you see the most popular mukbangs, they're often visually satisfying - as in a similar colour and arranged/organised in a perfect way. If the video creator is also deliberately and simultaneously trying to create ASMR content, then the ASMR aspect would come from the careful attention to detail in placing the items of food, and the clear crisp sounds that come from touching and eating. It is also a phenomenon that appears to be more popular in Asian countries such as South Korea, as opposed to Europe. The mukbangers who have impressive edible foods such as expensive footwear, handbags or other objects sometimes commission chefs to make these items for their videos. This exclusivity aspect can also be appealing to a lot of people since they would otherwise not see or be able to buy those food items anywhere else.</TEXT>
