    <TEXT>Here's a look at the graphic. I got the board when around 2014-15 but i never REALLY used it. Scratched up the graphic a bit on a curb, so I stickerbombed it, but i took off most of the stickers. The weird net looking thing in the back is a prototype longboard trailer i built for a shop class. [Landyachtz Switchblade 38](https://imgur.com/gallery/Tv8uYGd)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>imo, your prices are fair considering you're making custom boards. plus they're unique (i especially like the patagonia styled one). if you could cut down cost and still make profit, great, but honestly i think your boards are worth what you sell them for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're just looking to commute around campus, I would recommend a shorter board (27-30"). I would definitely go with big longboard wheels for the cracks (I ride with 90mm wheels and I still feel my board do a little hop over sidewalk cracks). Some people say they're a little overkill, but my personal favorites are Orangatang Kegels (80a) or if you're getting a smaller board, I love the orangatang in heats (80a). p.s. 80a refers to the "durometer" or the hardness of the wheel. 80a is pretty soft so it'll soften your ride a little and grip to the ground better. p.p.s. some people don't like orangatang (or rather Loaded) because they're products are a little pricier, but I am married to my orangatang kegels and I haven't found wheels that ride quite the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey i'm almost too scared to post this, but i really don't know. im a beginner and i started poking my ankle with a needle just to get a feel for it. i've never gotten a tattoo before but i wasn't noticing a pop or really any pain. long story short, just HAD to know if i this depth would actually do anything, so i whipped up a tiny bit of ink and tried it out (note: everything was done with gloves, rubbing alcohol, sterile needles.) still im scared of infection so i really only did a small line with the ink. it looks like the graphite did stay, so i think im going deep enough, but at the same time, i really don't feel any pain from the pokes im doing. do i need to go deeper? is it possible it just doesn't bother me? or is the ankle like a super non-sensitive tattoo area? thanks for the help guys</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey so I did my first stick and poke today and i was really happy about the result, but i reeeeeaaallly wanted to give it another try. anyway, i have three separate tattoos now  #128566;. so i mean my semi-serious question is, do i need to calm down? i really like the ones i have and they're all meaningful but i don't wanna doodle all over my body all at once lol. also, i've done one on my ankle, thigh, and top of the hand near the thumb and none of them have really hurt. i'm not sure if i'm just that focused in, but is it possible that i'm not going deep enough? ink is staying in and looks pretty dark but idk, no blood and very very little to no pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>listen you deleted your last post asking which pen ink to use. also, i understand feeling like shit and not caring if you harm yourself or not, but clearly you're worried about an infection. either use the pen ink and actually don't care if you mess up your skin or do it properly. this is just a cry for attention and you're perpetuating really unhealthy practices. snp can be a really good form of coping and therapy so i highly suggest you get in contact with a mental health specialist and discuss it with her. unless you're not worried, in which case save others from thinking this is an okay thing to post on here. mods please take this one down. tldr; based on your attitude it doesn't matter if it's infected or not right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>okay. i feel for you. just so you know, there's some pretty cheap ink available on amazon. sometimes if you look in craft stores, they'll have non-toxic india ink. as for the infection, see if there's any heat on the tattoo. if there is, it's very likely infected. first and foremost, best thing is to see a doctor. but i understand if you're not old enough to do this yourself. put a thin layer of antibacterial/antibiotic ointment on it 2-3 times a day but don't suffocate it. if it gets inflamed and pus starts forming, you don't have a choice. go to the doctor. in the future, try not approach a situation like this with the cynicism you did. more than anything, see a therapist. take a look at r/selfharm and try to find some solace. negligent self harm is still self harm. take care</TEXT>

    <TEXT>here's my take: professional tattoo transfer paper makes a huge difference when you want the exact image, bold and visible. if you wanna do some simple designs to start off before you get transfer paper or if your waiting for it in the mail, there's some pretty easy diy ways. personally, i started off by drawing directly onto my skin using a fine sharpie, or by using the following method. 1) draw design in pencil, making sure to get a substantial amount of graphite down (don't tear the paper) 2) go over the graphite with a bic ballpoint pen, again get as much ink down as you can. 3) apply transfer gel (or a non-toxic unscented deodorant) to skin and let air dry for ~30 seconds 4) press design onto skin ink side down and hold for ~15 seconds. this won't get perfect transfers, so i'd only recommend this for hand drawn tattoos. some tips: make sure you still clean the area beforehand, but keep in mind that this stencil wipes off very easily. you may want to make cuts in the piece of paper you use so the design can wrap flush against the skin. again, this will only really work for simple, small designs anyone correct me if i got smth wrong</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you could, but i personally regret trying to do my last tattoo (last post) with a 15 round magnum instead of just a liner. it fills it up well, but be ready to have a lot of "spread out" pain. personally i wasn't able to get my tattoo as dark as i'd like on the first session because the entire area was getting to sensitive. good to note that this was on my inner bicep though, so it's a pretty sensitive area as is. i'd say you'll eventually fill it in either way, but liner would be more concentrated, but less passes, and a mag would be more spread out, but more passes. of course a 9rs would also be good, but i find that i get frustrated with how little in they deposit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i can sympathize with what you're dealing with. i can't tell you this is what's happening in your relationship, but here's what i learned after having a very open and honest conversations with my girlfriend at the time. you have to consider (and accept) the possibility that her libido is just much lower than yours. i used to complain to my gf that i didn't feel she was intimate enough when we make out, so her wanting to do exactly what i asked, would do exactly what you describe (light touching, then getting up). at first this bugged me. but then she explained that she is attracted to me in that way, but sometimes she just doesn't feel like "initiating that kind of night" which is absolutely okay. as for why she lets you go down on her, well two reasons. 1) it feels good 2) she's assuming that you enjoy doing it so why wouldn't she turn it down? something really important i learned in that relationship is that yes, once you start rubbing and pulling clothes off, she gets horny. but before that, she might not be. and if she isn't horny, why would she try to initiate by going down on you. another important thing: whether or not you've had sex, there's also the chance that she doesn't want to start something that will end in sex because she doesn't want to right then. try not to take any of this personally. i know it's hard. but in those moments try to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. i know i wish i had.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>also not a tattoo artist, but i've only worn gloves for tattooing other people. way i see it is that if i cut my nails and thoroughly wash my hands beforehand, i'm in the clear. i don't agree with the other comment though since you sweat everywhere. it shouldn't be a problem considering people get tattoos on their armpits. i think it's definitely important to be cautious, but (and again not a tattoo artist) a tattoo has basically the same risk of infection as any other wound. from what i've read, the gloves are mainly to prevent cross contamination of bacteria and blood between the artist and the client. so when i do my tats on myself, no gloves. especially in these times, it also seems a bit selfish to buy unnecessary medical equipment for cosmetic uses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>but this proves my point exactly... you're covered in bacteria. one way or another bacteria will eventually reach the tattoo. idk i've done all my tattoos glove free and haven't had any problems. also, surgery is a bit deeper than a tattoo so i imagine the risk of infection increases drastically. again, not a doctor or tattoo artist, but personally, i've had much deeper wounds with much larger risks of infection that don't get infected using basic sanitary practices. i think it's a bit overkill to try and keep everything absolutely sterile; bacteria falls off your skin from your forehead, a cough could send bacteria into your area, you might momentarily touch an un-sterile part of your body while trying to stretch skin, etc. my opinion is that by the end of the tattoo, your gloves will be just as "dirty" as a hand washed with anti bacterial soap. if it makes you feel better, wear gloves, but they aren't immune to the risk of taking on bacteria.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my bad lol i didn't know it was that deep for you. you're absolutely right. best sanitary practice is ALWAYS advised. hopefully you know i agree with you there. so the following is not advice, simply information with which one can use at their own risk on their own body: tattooing has been around forever; people used to use "unsanitary" tools, from thorns as needles, and tree sap as ink. and yes, these are still practices in many parts of the world. people get tattoos in the middle of the jungle and they don't get infected. yeah it's a matter of chance, but every time you get a tattoo, you risk infection no matter how by-the-books you are. yes doing things like using professional needles, professional ink, and gloves will lower that risk, but the risk still exists. if you're the kind of person who wants to absolutely lower your chances of infection, go the whole 9 (which i would recommend for new tattooers since you don't know how your body will react). personally, i know my body can handle bacteria very well as i've gotten multiple cuts and scrapes that were nowhere near sanitized. TLDR: wearing gloves is like wearing a seatbelt. yeah it's pretty stupid not to wear one but you likely won't die. in that one in a hundred, yeah it might make a difference, but you take the risk knowing your capabilities and experiences. PS: most of this is for anyone else reading this, but to you: don't take reddit comments too serious my guy. idek you. best of luck  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>after deliberation with the lovely redditor below, the answer to your question of "is it 100% necessary" is no, it's not. none of the safety practices are necessary, but they are highly recommended if you want to avoid infection. it's not necessary that you cook your food, but it'll decrease your chance of getting sick drastically. now for the "wrong" opinion (lol) in the list of precautions necessary for stick and poke on yourself, i'd say gloves rank pretty low. the only reason i say this is because i personally think it would be ridiculous to hold back from doing a tattoo because i didn't have gloves. personally, that's a very small risk im willing to take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>honestly, what helped me the most is accepting that i'm not a tattoo artist, so with each tattoo, i try my best, but i know that the value goes beyond just how it looks. i'm barely a good drawer, so my first tattoo looks terrible (peep the cactus in my history) but i wouldn't want it removed. i'd say be okay with messing up (by putting it in a hidden/personal spot). also start small. you can try using fruits/fake skin as practice, but in my experience, there's a huge difference in technique. start with a small line on your foot, see how that feels/looks, and adjust your technique accordingly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>fuck these haters. the logic is so skewed. if it's something offensive to you, don't tattoo it on you. if i tattooed a skull on my arm, you wouldn't bat an eye. now if i told you the meaning of it is to symbolize the the death of a certain race, then it's problematic. intention matters. these people outright signing it off as a racist symbol is exactly why it still has the negative connotations. example: during the crusades, the cross became a symbol of destruction and evil for many people. yet the positive connotation has dominated because people chose to associate it with the good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you want to tattoo again, i use my upper thigh and ankle as practice spots since they're less visible. and if i really mess something up, i kind of just accept that that's one of my many mistakes. personally, the way i see it is that if i got a scrape or a cut, i really don't care enough to try and prevent scarring (even on my face). so i'm not too concerned in general about permanent, visible mistakes. if you're more of the type of person who would try 10 different products to prevent a scar, i would practice on fruit and fake skin until you're comfortable with the level of risk (less time practicing = higher risk of messing up obviously, so you'll know when you're comfortable with the level of risk that your skill comes with) that last part is a but convoluted, but i hope you understand what i'm getting at</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you can't. stop using sewing needles. india ink isn't sterile. why would you even think there's a "proper" way to clean this? go buy some tattoo needles. "my parents will find out" is a terrible excuse. make a fake amazon account. send it to a drop box. stand guard at the door to grab the package before they see. you can get 60 needles and .5 oz of ink for total $20. if you can't afford that, then you definitely can't afford the potential medical bills. and if you still want to use sewing needles, stop asking dumbass questions like "hOw Do I mAkE tHe SeWiNg NeEdLe HuRt LeSs???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah that's fair, i'd try to find an official dynamic or kuro sumi website; those are pretty popular. oh and i just remembered that [stickandpoketattookit.com](https://stickandpoketattookit.com/how-to-stick-and-poke/) sells ink sets that are in .5 oz bottles. i've personally used them and they work alright. a tad overpriced, but shipping is decently quick and the ink took to my skin pretty well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i haven't done too much with color, but i wouldn't overlap anything cause it will mix the two colors (green will turn lime green, orange will turn a lighter orange) i would try to color each separately as best you can</TEXT>
