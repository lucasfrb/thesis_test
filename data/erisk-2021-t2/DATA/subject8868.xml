    <TEXT>I have learnt my values, I am just simply not interested in your offer. You may be over but I just don #8217;t find any interest in the offer. Thank you for letting me know the value of your offer, and honestly, I am not being rude nor blunt I am simply declining :)! Also my reason as to why I #8217;ve said no is because I just find no interest in the offer. Telling me that you #8217;re over and that you #8217;re at the verge of screaming and annoyed and tired isn #8217;t going to help your case, just saying :)! This is a roblox game with VIRTUAL pets so how can I be considerate of your feelings when all I did was simply decline your offer? You possibly could be overpaying, but also I am not snobby, If I don #8217;t take an interest to your offer I have the right to say so! Also, even if the offers were over/fair I haven #8217;t found an interest in them and that #8217;s my right to accept or decline offers :)! Again I have being neither rude nor snobby, as I have apologized to you for declining your offers. I also didn #8217;t ask you to overpay, I simply asked what you would add to the trade, and I didn #8217;t find interest in the offer so I declined and apologized! You being upset at me for doing the polite thing and apologizing after I decline is quite childish, as I have done nothing wrong. I do not have to give an apology in this situation because I did not do anything wrong, I simply declined your offer and on top of that I apologized for declining. Again, I #8217;ll decline the offer and I #8217;m sorry I am just not interested in your offer! Again I realize it may be fair, but I just don #8217;t take an interest to your offer, so could you do a solid and try not to get upset/insult me because I simply declined?? I also never said you were under, I asked what you were going to add and after you said that I replied with  #8220;no thanks, sorry! #8221; because as I have stated, I haven #8217;t taken a liking to the offer. Lastly, saying you feel bad because of me is so incredibly childish. All I simply did was decline the offer and apologize multiple times, and you decide to insult me calling me snobby/rude, and making the situation more dramatic than it actually was. So, in the future, make sure if somebody says no to your offer, don #8217;t go being over dramatic and call them rude or snobby, because in the end that makes you childish in the situation, when it could #8217;ve been handled better! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I did was simply decline your offer and on top of that I apologized for declining, there was no reason to cry in the situation and honestly you could #8217;ve handled it better. I do not have to give an apology because I didn #8217;t do anything wrong, all I did was decline a trade offer and then I even apologized about it. But sure, if you wanna continue to say I did something to make you cry go ahead.</TEXT>
