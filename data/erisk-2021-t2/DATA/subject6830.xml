    <TEXT>I was doing an interview with a new tarot deck. I asked the question  #8220;what are your limits as a deck? #8221; And I got the knight of swords reversed. I #8217;m not exactly sure what this is trying to tell me. I #8217;d like some of y #8217;alls assumptions if you don #8217;t mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m new to this stuff too, but I believe you probably should cleanse every single ingredient you use when you first get them and when they feel  #8216;dirty #8217;. So I #8217;d say yes. Also make sure you wash them with water before use, they can get moldy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was looking at Neopronouns (pronouns other than she, they, and he) and I found fae/faer/faers. I #8217;m wondering if that #8217;s offensive to the fae? It sounds like they might be. Edit: btw I #8217;m not interested in using them. I believe I #8217;m just going to stick to they/them for now. If I don #8217;t, I #8217;ll probably use xe/xem/xyrs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My cat darts around the room at night. How can I make her stop?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 11:07:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title says, my cat darts around the room at night and it #8217;s very loud, therefore it keeps me up. Sometimes she bats at my foot too, which can be painful. How do I make her stop? I #8217;ve tried playing with her before I go to bed to let that energy out, but she just ignores it. I #8217;ve told her to stop, but of course she #8217;s a cat so she doesn #8217;t care. Wo do keep her in my room (which I pretty big) due to two reasons; we can #8217;t install a cat door (at least yet) and I really need my personal space so I can #8217;t leave my door open, and she #8217;s very prone to hiding and getting lost somewhere for five days. Got trapped in our wall once. During the day she #8217;s very calm and affectionate. I don #8217;t understand how she #8217;s so different at night.</TEXT>

This isn #8217;t near everything, just a few things that come to mind: -my  #8216;friend #8217; used to verbally harass me for being LGBTQ, I only got away when I transferred to online school -All of my  #8216;friends #8217; have either abandoned me or absolutely hate me with a passion -The teachers at the online school I #8217;ve been going to (I transferred before 2nd semester of last year) don #8217;t care about my real pronouns and name, one of them even said it was a  #8216;nickname #8217; -Every time I talk about something I like my oldest sister and one of my cousins nit-picks me and other people get annoyed but don #8217;t say anything (I #8217;m autistic, so I talk about things I like a lot) -I #8217;ve lost the ability to hide my stims in public, so people are always glaring at me -I #8217;m transgender, the entire country I live in hates me and I hate my body so much -No one takes me seriously since I #8217;m literally 13, therefore I don #8217;t matter in the eyes of society and when I open up people always say  #8220;you #8217;re so young, there #8217;s so much more life ahead of you, these years don #8217;t matter #8221; -People always invalidate my trauma because I don #8217;t have abusive parents -I #8217;ve gotten addicted to self harm and I don #8217;t see a way out -I hate confrontation, so even though I have a therapist I can #8217;t ask for help and I #8217;ve been lying for months -I feel like a fake because I don #8217;t have any diagnosis of being mentally ill but I #8217;m definitely not stable. My therapist is technically a counselor, so she may not be able to diagnose me but again, I can #8217;t ask -No one seems to care enough to check if I #8217;m actually okay.

    <TEXT>That sounds right. Another thing to add is my style in clothing, what I feel my gender and sexuality is, my hobbies, what I want in life, and my liking towards certain things change very frequently, more than they do in other people. I #8217;m afraid though. What if I #8217;m just faking all of this and I don #8217;t have DID? Isn #8217;t DID caused by major childhood trauma? The only thing I remember is some bullying by another kid. I remember some things he #8217;s done, but I don #8217;t feel as if that #8217;s all of it. These things include stealing my things, blaming stuff he did on me, pushing me into walls, teasing me about my interests, and being rude to my friends (which caused me to have none). He blamed all of this on ADHD and got away with it. This happened all through 2nd to 5th grade. I will agree my parents aren #8217;t the best with emotions and stuff. Every time I bring up something that my dad did that hurt me he gets mad or ignores me. Same with mom. (That #8217;s not all but I don #8217;t really feel like going into that right now). Another reason I #8217;m afraid I might be faking is because I do have in interest in researching about DID. So maybe I #8217;m convincing myself this is happening to me but it isn #8217;t? I don #8217;t know what to think. Edit: also I remember in October of 2019 a  #8220;friend #8221; called me a sin. I know she said many other things in the exact moment but that #8217;s all I remember from it. It #8217;s been wiped away or something. I also escape into fictional realities a lot. And I mean a lot. I create people I want in these worlds and basically just have the world the way I want it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-04 01:51:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>The first vivid memory I have took place a few weeks before my 13th birthday. It was of the first time I self harmed. turning 14 in December this year. All I can remember from my childhood is that I was bullied, but that #8217;s it. Barely any details. I know one boy pushed me into walls, stole my stuff, (and way more I #8217;m not fully aware of but I know happened) but I don #8217;t really have the memories, they #8217;re all cloudy if you know what I mean. The ones that aren #8217;t cloudy don #8217;t even exist. I know I #8217;m October last year (I was 12, so before I cut for the first time) a friend called me a sin in front of a whole class, but I can #8217;t actually access that memory, it #8217;s also cloudy. I just know it happened. Even the memory of me self harming for the first time is starting to get cloudy. I don #8217;t know why I can #8217;t remember anything but I hate it. I hate it so much. Does this happen to you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s exactly how I feel! Sometimes I think the only reason I #8217;m comfy with being ace and have no problems with it is because trauma. As far as I know, no, I have not been sexually abused, but also the first vivid memory I have is from a few months before my 13th birthday and that #8217;s fading away too, so I might have been. I #8217;m turning 14 in December btw It kind of makes me think that I have to go through a traumatic experience that has to do with being romantic (ex, a toxic relationship) to be proud of who I am. It #8217;s a really toxic mindset to be in and I know it #8217;s wrong but the thought wont go away. Life is fun, isn #8217;t it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Grey on a pride flag is honestly an instant no for me. (For me using the flag, not for me accepting the identity, everyone valid) like sometimes I think I #8217;m genderflux, but the flag.. it makes me feel disconnected to the identity. I love the vibrant flags. They #8217;re so beautiful and I could stare at them for hours. But flags with grey? Yeah no. The grey lithromantic flag seems to have been made with a very specific  #8220;type #8221; of lithromantic in mind and I just don #8217;t like it.</TEXT>
