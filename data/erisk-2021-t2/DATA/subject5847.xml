    <TEXT>Hey man. Congrats on the 14 days, I remember having these in the start as well, your brain wants something good and it found out that it won't be alcohol, so it wants something else. If it stops you from drinking, go for it :D just remember a bit more exercise , also exercising with a clean mind and body is 10x more efficient than with rest booze from the weekend. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To everyone who is on the fence on buying it, I can highly recommend it. Using the mesh coil going with 0,6ohm , and using fcuking flava which is 50/50 and 6 mg freebase nic. I gotta tell you, the flavour of this little piece of heaven is better than from sub ohm tank...(Pico istick 25) It takes some getting used to since draw is very restricted versus my previous device, but I will NOT go back!!

I saw lots of benchmarks with the 1080 founders edition playing triple A titles on ultra settings etc. But I want to hear from the community , if I should upgrade the GPU or wait for a newer generation. I'm actually troubled , sure the RTX 2080TI is a powerhouse , but this little increase in performance at a price tag this high, I just can't justify this buy.

    <TEXT>Hello :) I bought a smok NORD a few weeks back and am very happy with it. The flavor was crazy... Well the first coil got boring after 4-5 days , no worries. I bought two replacement pods which came with new coils, I decided NOT to switch the pod and only the coil. Now, the flavor ain't the same ? Would it be possible to rinse out the pods ( maybe give them a run through the dishwasher or something? Let them dry for 24 hours) to get that first hit flavor experience? Or should I exchange the pod everytime and throw the old ones out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I drilled holes into the desk, around  #216;7 cm. 2 of them, one below the screen and one below the PC. I could connect my KB and mouse via the screen as the screen is connected via USB to the PC. The USB cable from screen to PC is going beneath the desk which comes out behind the pc, same goes for the DP and power cable. Hue ambi light cables also go beneath the screen. Beneath the desk is a "5x plug" I guess it is called, which is bolted on the other side. All cables below are sleeved and hidden in a tray :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello I am a proud owner of a 1080 Founders Edition ( yeah I hit the buy now button the day it came out, the GTX 690 was finished) I've recently purchased an UW screen with a 3440x1440 @ 120hz resolution. The card is still pushing amazing and satisfying frames , but I don't think this will be the case in a year due to the high resolution. Sure I was stoked about the release of the RTX series but the performance gain is not worth my money. But it might be needed anyways? What do you think the next generation of Nvidia will provide us? 3440x1440 at a steady 100+ frames on AAA titles? Shall I dish out the money and go all in for a 2080Ti hybrid and OC the shit out of it? Let me hear your thoughts :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I usually vape the ADV series from fcuking flava which is a 50 vg  amp; 50pg , when purchased, nicotin boosters will be added to the order so I can top the bottle off. These boosters are also 50pg and 50vg But recently I received two boosters of 70/30 and didn't notice it before it was too late. Is the juice ruined?</TEXT>

Will there be a significant increase in charging time? Because 4 hours is pretty crazy, we live in the 21st century , not even a Tesla takes 4 hours to charge</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course the 1080ti will run future games, it's a crazy card. I just wanted some horsepower to fully use my 3440x1440 @ 120hz screen, also like Ray Tracing on story games and singleplayer games which I usually play on max settings unlike the competitive games. Well, all recommend to use 3 single power connectors, but I don't have them at this time. I am waiting for for 2 more custom sleeved ones and than it should be fine. But I stressed the heck out of my GPU overnight and there were no issues with the current setup :)</TEXT>

Maybe down the line you want to upgrade your system and are capable of running 120hz @ 3440x1440 , than the bigger expense now will be gone later. You will be happy either way.</TEXT>

Last year June I was still a smoker and got my annual check up and cleaning at the dentist - as always they tell me to stop smoking. Well , this time I did and she could clearly see a difference. But coffee  amp; tea is also a magnet for discoloring. No matter what, your thanks you for not combusting tar into it just like your lungs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone First of all thank you all for the inspiring posts, the real time struggle and the healing which can be felt in this sub. A little story : My alcohol abuse started when I was 15 years old , for the most parts it was only in the weekends but to excess where as the rest was able to have a few drinks while I was counting bloody bottles.. The years went on with no stopping and the alcohol soon joined forces with narcotics and I even managed to survive a cardiac arrest due to an amphetamine overdose. I could elaborate on the history further, however there is really no need as most of us have been there. **12 years later, I had my last day of intoxication.** **198 days later - I've met the love of my life who also is living a sober life. She is a very caring, supporting and loving woman and we help each other getting trough the next day.** **I can feel that my body and mind are free of anxiety and concerns and have achieved a healthy weight and am in general very healthy, which I thank my wonderful girlfriend for.** **I have no desire to return to my past but accept my future as a sober alcoholic.**  #8203; ***IWNDWYT***  #8203; //NV</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, whats your goal? Only drink in the weekends? Not drink at all? It looks like your social surroundings involve drinking and gatherings/parties. If you DON'T WANT to drink, you gotta say NO man..I know it's not as easy as it sounds. I've been there , yeah I drink only in the weekend , like the rest - but I didn't DRINK like the rest did, I drank until coma status was achieved and that is just not healthy. If you can manage a few drinks until you get a good buzz and than stop and drink water, sure go ahead. However, I don't think that this is the purpose of this sub. If you don't want to drink, get help - new friends come automatically together with the new activities. Just reach out , I got time :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello I am currently in the process of assembling parts for my next PC. It will be equipped with an RTX or big Navi down the line. However my question is the amount of RAM I am not doing any rendering or multi task functions etc, it will be primarily for gaming on a 3440x1440 120hz display. I read a lot of articles that 16 GB of RAM would be more than sufficient , i can always exchange/upgrade to 32/64 down the line, however for the initial build I would think that 16 might be enough. Second question would be the MHZ , is 2866 good enough to begin with or since I am already cutting down on the ram should I go with 3200 or even 4000 MHz? The mobo will support 4000 if I go down that lane Let me know your thoughts</TEXT>

I am thinking that 2 TB maybe only 1 is more than enough as I only have a few games in rotation. I could always add another down the line.. Sure it is more expensive , but I do spend what I want to spend This would also reduce cable management issues Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that might be true, but I however recommend working electronics over cooling , since I won't be overclocking or do very demanding things except gaming on 1440p ultrawide , and I also like the robust look :) But! Maybe the new AMD GPU's will perform even better? I am just aiming for +100fps at medium high settings. "Just" is maybe a bit harsh since 1440p ultrawide even put my 1080 founders in a very hot state</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, however as mentioned , starting from 0 so maybe the extra bucks spend on a better GPU will last longer? I started gaming when the GTX690 was a thing, and I didn't upgrade until 1080 hit the market..that is a 3 generational (generational, is that a word?) But I am grateful for your input , maybe the 3070 will be enough , I am sure benchmarks will drop for that card even before the 3080 will be widely available, and if AMD will knock it out of the park, I will go with that You are also right about the mindset, but I am not budgeting my PC/music/office build. I want good performance and good looks :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your comment! Really appreciate it. For me this is the only way to go without overspending , sure the 2070 will run into some issues on 3440x1440 , but I am sure it will run games like Diablo and some other titlens just fine. And with gsync the fps drops should not be that noticeable This way I can Play right away and know that one day I will upgrade. Edit : But I dont see the 2070 i am looking at eligible for the step Up</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello I have been caught in the challenge of getting a 3080 , I've been planning my build for quite a while and it will come out nicely. However , rtx3080 is a no go and I won't wait until 2021.. My display is a 120hz 3440x1440 gsync monitor. What GPUs are you running and what would you recommend if I aim for 80-90 frames ? Can I maybe only settle for 61 steady frames with gsync on? Any reply is appreciated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good day everyone ! Nice to see so many nice builds on here. So as the title states, girlfriend got a new job with odd hours which will give me some more spare time than usual. I sold my complete system last year ( part of a lifestyle change) and figured once I want to play again I will start from scratch. I have a AW3814 , 3440x1440 120hz screen and peripherals. Now , the 3080 won't be available until next year - 3070 which also could be an option will probably suffer the same supply issues. To hell with the 3090 Benchmarks indicate that a 2070super actually would fit my needs ( or should I wait for big Navi?) I won't buy a new/used 2080ti Any one have same resolution with a 2070s?( Share results) Since the beginning of my pc journey I always used Intel and always went for the i7 x700K version I'm pretty sure the 10700K will suffice as I do not anything else besides gaming - together with AIO and 32gb at 3200mhz TL:DR 3440X1440 100HZ 100FPS , which GPU..I don't have any more patience and want to buy now ( latest mid November)</TEXT>
