    <TEXT>Hello, I honestly have no idea about anything gardening or succulent related - so apologies if these are stupid questions! I planted a few succulents in this trough maybe two years ago and they #8217;ve gone totally wild and filled the space completely. I #8217;ve bought a second trough to try and replant them, but I #8217;m a bit worried about doing it! Can anyone help me with a few questions? Big tall spiky guy (far left) - he #8217;s getting a bit floppy and I #8217;m worried he will break. Is there a way to trim his height down or hold him up? Long droopy guy (far right) - he #8217;s really spreading out and down, can he be split up into separate plants? He is growing like crazy! Large flat-ish guy (on the left) - can be be split too? He #8217;s spread over a large area of the trough. Stubby chubby guy (far left at the front) - he feels almost loose, like he isn #8217;t well rooted, but seems happy otherwise. Does anyone know why this would happen? They are all planted in an all purpose compost, and live in a top floor stairwell with a glass roof. It #8217;s mild in winter and hot in summer. We have a cat who will eat anything and no floor space in the stairwell, so they need to stay in the balcony troughs. Thanks for any advice you can offer :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! I #8217;m sorry to hear your having such a hard time, but you #8217;ve still read so much, it #8217;s such a great achievement. I really struggled to focus at the start of the year, and one thing that helped me was to break every book down into sections of twenty pages or so. I stuck a post it at the end of each section and told myself I only needed to get through a section a day. Once I got in the momentum, I found I wanted to read more sections and eventually found I could just pick up and read regularly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really disliked The Binding, it had such a great premise but it took a nasty turn part way through. I just wasn #8217;t expecting the plot to go down some of the roads it did and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Others have given it great reviews though, I think I expected it to be less dark in theme. The Silence of the Girls was one of my top books of the year - I loved it. It deals with difficult topics really well, and made me cry a few times. It set me off on a bit of a Greek binge though - I followed up with Circe, Song of Achilles and The Penelopiad and loved all of them!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I broke books down into sections before reading and told myself I only had to read one section a day. I put post it notes on each section. If I wasn #8217;t in the mood for reading, hey, I #8217;d read something! And if i was in the mood, nothing was stopping me reading more. I started with ten or twenty pages, and then upped it to dividing the book by seven with the goal of finishing it in a week. It got me in a good rhythm and gave me little targets I could achieve :)</TEXT>

I read it over Christmas, on rainy days by the fire and it was so atmospheric. I was on such a rollercoaster of emotion throughout it -  gt;! I thought I hated Bunny, and couldn #8217;t wait for him to die. As soon as he did, I missed him, and was devastated by everyone #8217;s sense of loss. I #8217;ve never felt so guilty about the death of a character before, I almost felt like I was responsible, like I #8217;d been egging them in to do it. ! lt;  Do you recommend anything else by Jasper Fforde?

    <TEXT>The Last Was a good whodunnit, I enjoyed reading it, it #8217;s probably a 6/10 for me. Some of the characters were a bit dull, and the pacing could have been better, but I found it entertaining and it #8217;s worth reading if you like anything post apocalyptic. I didn #8217;t love The Binding - I liked the premise, and the first third was great, but then (spoilers/content warning)  gt;! there was a nasty amount of rape and assault in the book which I wasn #8217;t expecting. It seemed to be the only storyline for the female characters and it #8217;s the main thing that stuck with me from the book ! lt; I almost didn #8217;t finish but I pushed through because I was over half way.

    <TEXT>It might sound dumb, but reading made me feel like I was achieving something and using my time better. I never really had a hobby or identity, but now I can confidently say I #8217;m a book person, which is a great feeling. Reading also gives me something to talk about, instead of just saying I did nothing with my weekend, so I felt more confident socially and in small talk situations. It is also great (surprisingly) for getting me out of the house. When I feel anxious or panicky, I go for a walk to a coffee shop and read, or walk to the bookshop and browse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s possibly not the advice you want to hear, but I would suggest settling for a good job and then working on it over time to make it your dream job! It #8217;s very difficult to find a well paid role with good hours and benefits which is also your dream role. However, finding a well paid role with good hours and benefits which is tolerable is much easier. In time, it #8217;s possible to find ways to do more of the things you enjoy in your role. It #8217;s also important to remember that you are not defined by your job, and volunteering etc outside of work is a great way to get that personal fulfilment while still paying the bills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think giving your cat space of their own is the most important thing. I heard cats can be  #8216;bush cats #8217;, who like to lurk on the ground, or  #8216;tree cats #8217; who like to sit up high and look at their territory. Our cat is a tree cat, so he has a big tall cat tree in the living room and access to high shelves in the other rooms. We don #8217;t bother him if he #8217;s up there - that #8217;s his space, we don #8217;t invade it. If you have multiple pets having a clean litter tray for each cat is also important. Plus lots of scratching posts. Play is also important to tire them out. We have a  #8216;cat dancer #8217; off amazon which our cat goes wild for. Feliway is also an option, but it #8217;s better to address the route cause. I #8217;m not an expert - I am a crazy cat lady though :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have found that when I am anxious around the cat, the cat gets anxious too. If you acting worried about the get getting upset when guests come over, the cat might pick up on it? When we have guests, I always ask them to just sit quietly for a minute and not try and touch the cat. If he comes up to sniff, people just ignore him and he realises they are not so scary :) He still runs like hell whenever the door rings though, some things will never change!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cat grass helps with digestion and I think the extra fibre pads out his poo. Thinking back, we also tried Forti Flora, but that made things worse, and feeding smaller amounts more frequently in case he was eating too quick and upsetting his stomach. I #8217;m in Scotland too :) I #8217;m in Edinburgh and I generally find the water good, but not as good as the water when I lived in the country. I don #8217;t know if the filter does much in terms of cleaning up the water, but he drinks much more now we have a fountain!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a BeautyPie subscription and really love it!! Firstly, it stops me splurging when I don #8217;t need to. No more wandering into the shops and spending  #163;50. I find I shop less and buy wiser as I plan out what I need to purchase each month, rather than impulse buying. I pay the yearly subscription for a  #163;100 a month allowance, and I have been spending less on skincare since joining. I also really love the products, obviously. I am very wary of what seems to be a bargain but everything I have received has been of exceptional quality. I will no longer buy traditional luxury skincare because of Beauty Pie. I have dry, sensitive skin and my top picks are: **Plantastic Apricot Butter Cleansing Balm**: This has replaced the Clinique balm cleanser for me, it #8217;s beautiful, soft, leaves my skin feeling amazing. Definitely a Holy Grail. **Super Healthy Skin Deep Purifying Cleanser**: I use this when I have been wearing lots of makeup or sunscreen, or am getting a spot. Doesn #8217;t leave my skin feeling dry or tight, just very clean. **Superactive Capsules Essential Ceramides**: These feel so expensive, and really soothe my skin. I #8217;ve seen my redness reduce significantly since I started using them. I use them with the hydration drops most nights. Definitely a Holy Grail. **Japan Fusion Supreme Cream**: Hybrid gel/cream texture, so moisturising, sinks in beautifully, not sticky, soothing... love it! On its way to Holy Grail! **Japan Fusion Bio-Ceramide Moisture Mask**: Hyper hydrating and soothing, a little goes a long way, worth it. **Plantastic Micropeeling drops**: My first dabble in acid, really sorted out texture issues on my chin. Love them - Holy Grail!! When I find I don #8217;t need any new skincare, I can either let my credit build up until I need something, or throw in some makeup or a candle. The eyeshadow sticks are amazing for the price, and the candles are wonderful - really fragrant and clean burning. I have my eye on the body products too - maybe next month! The only thing I felt let down with was the hair treatment - but then I whacked a heap in to finish the tube and let it sit when I was in the bath, and my hair has come out BEAUTIFUL, so that seems to have been user error!!!! Very long post, hope that helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a knit into yarn over stitch (which gave the blanket name of KIYO). It gave a lovely pattern, even before blocking, and my tension isn #8217;t amazing.

    <TEXT>I use Noom and I find it really good!! I will agree the initial quiz was a bit basic, but the programme itself is good. Disappointed to see Emily shilling it, she has the kind of eating pattern they actively discourage, it #8217;s a weird partnership and I was taken aback when I saw. Personally, Noom has really helped my mindset and approach to eating (daily CBT lessons are part of Noom). I #8217;ve shifted nearly 30lbs this year in a healthy, sustainable way and I #8217;m so glad I signed up. I was a firm believer in doing what my body tells me, and ended up very overweight and unhappy :( Each to their own though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was supposed to be enjoying the hills and beaches of Northumbria, so took my second best option and knitted a shawl which reminded me of the landscape. It was pretty cathartic, and at least I have something to show for my week on the sofa! Pattern is Siren Song by Libby Jonson, yarn is Yakety Yak 4 ply by Ginger Twist Studios. Cat is Finn, who posed obligingly while I wiggled a bag of Dreamies at him. https://www.ravelry.com/projects/Rosieb803/siren-song</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello YarnTrolls! I have five mini skeins of lace weight mohair, 420m in total. I #8217;m too tired to think and make decisions at the moment, and I #8217;m getting myself tied in knots thinking about how to use it. I think it #8217;s because it #8217;s so lovely I #8217;m afraid to use it and commit. Does any have ideas or patterns they could suggest? I was thinking a wee scrunchie would be fun, but that would probably only use one mini skein and I don #8217;t need five scrunchies!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our ragdoll has always made what we affectionately call his  #8216;killing noise #8217;. He tends to do it when relaxing watching the birds or just hanging out, and has done this for as long as I can remember. He is three this November. We were googling trying to find out what the noise is. Turns out that it is tooth grinding and can be a sign of something serious. Finn is fit and healthy, no eating troubles and has passed his dental check-ups with flying colours every year. His last vet check up was in January.

We call is his  #8216;murder noise #8217; as he tends to do it when watching birds out of the window, or sometimes just chilling out. I was googling to noise tonight and it turns out he is grinding his teeth, which can be a sign of something serious.

    <TEXT>I am 30lbs down, 222lbs to 192lbs, and have lost the bulk of that weight during the coronavirus lockdown. None of my work colleagues have seen me for four months, and I haven #8217;t told anyone I am watching what I eat. This is for two reasons - firstly, I don #8217;t like talking about dieting or my weight, and secondly, my colleagues have form for being a bit bitchy about others losing weight. I know many of them have gained weight during lockdown, and I am terrified of them noticing my weight loss when I go back to work. I #8217;m sure there will be comments and I #8217;ll get grilled on it. 30lbs isn #8217;t a massive amount, but I #8217;m only 5 #8217;5 so it is definitely noticeable now! Has anyone come out of lockdown a bit lighter, or have any tips for deflecting unwanted weight loss questions?!?</TEXT>

I did kinda get how much it was the other day though, when I was carrying maybe 15lbs of shopping up the stairs. We live on the 4th floor and I was puffed out. Realised I #8217;d been carrying twice that round all the time a few months ago!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all! I #8217;m Rosie, 29F, from Edinburgh, Scotland. My SW was a little over 220lbs in Jan of this year, CW 190lbs. This is my first challenge and I #8217;m hoping to get the momentum going again on my weight loss after slowing down a lot during the Coronavirus lockdown here in Scotland. I #8217;m aiming to get to 182lbs by the end of the challenge, which would put me in overweight BMI instead of obese. I #8217;m going on holiday at the end of the challenge, and a non-scale goal for me would be to hike up a good hill with my boyfriend!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could walk to Stockbridge down through Dean Village, straight along the water of Leith path. Very pretty walk. LoveCrumbs in Stockbridge is great for a slice of cake and you can walk to the botanic gardens easily and see the glasshouses. If you like Dean Village, it is worth walking through the Colonies. I think most pubs and restaurants in Stockbridge are decent, but can #8217;t comment on child friendliness. Stockbridge is very family orientated, so I imagine they all are. Hectors is nice for pub food, so is the Antiquary, but it #8217;s more pub than gastro-pub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some more context - I bought three hanks of indie hand dyed yarn direct from the dyer when she was having a clear out. This is the state of one of the hanks. Some of these pieces are only a few metres long. I #8217;ve only been knitting a year, but have never seen this with yarn before. Is this normal?! Surely not! The yarn is the dyers own hand dyed yarn. It was much cheaper than she usually sells it for. Would I be unreasonable to ask for a refund? She didn #8217;t disclose the yarn was below standard quality at all, I #8217;m so disappointed. This was destined to be part of a t-shirt, but if the other two hanks are like this, I #8217;m not sure it #8217;s suitable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not in the Newington area, but I #8217;d suggest getting a few sessions with a personal trainer at the gym you join.

I wouldn #8217;t mind too much about look sweaty and out of puff - 99% of people don #8217;t pay any attention to others at the gym, the other 1% are eejits.

    <TEXT>My grandpa died this morning. I went out for a walk to try and take my mind of things. Stepped out of the way to let an elderly man having trouble walking pass, and keep social distance. He leered at me, pointed at my crotch and made kissy noises as he went past. I called him a disgusting old c**t and gave him the finger. I am so fucking angry. I was wearing leggings, a parka, a bobble hat and a mask. Red eyes from all the crying. What is fucking wrong with these people.</TEXT>
