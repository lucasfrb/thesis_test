    <TITLE>Mommy, I'm sorry</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-19 03:46:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know I hurt you, and I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to. I feel so stressed out about next semester, finances, and moving again, and I took that out on you. I hate that I can't just talk through stressful things like an adult, and instead I just freak out and yell at you for bringing it up. I just feel like I can never relax, but I also can never focus, never just get things done. I don't know what I'm doing anymore, I have no idea where my life is going, and I just feel like hiding from all the responsibilities. Even when I tried so hard to get a job, I couldn't, and I just regret this entire summer. I'm so upset and disappointed with myself and I'm sorry that I can't just talk to you about everything.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-19 03:50:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to say that my life is spiraling out of control, but in reality it already has spiraled. I'm so lost, I'm a disappointment to myself and my family, I'm going to fail everything I try to do, and I just want to die. I've let myself and so many people down, cut off loved ones for no reason other than the fact I can't handle being a normal person. I hate who I am.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm trying to reach out for help the best I can but this summer hasn't gone very well and I've cut myself off from a lot of people who I used to be able to talk to. I've made a lot of cries for help and I really just need someone to respond. I just want to know that someone has noticed how much I'm hurting right now, because I'm really trying to keep it together but it's so fucking hard</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just fucking relapsed and it sucks because I will never be able to do as well as I had been doing. I also binged so much. So tomorrow I give myself permission to cut instead of eating and run instead of sleeping, because I'm a disgusting fat fuck and I hate myself. All the motivation to be healthy and recover in a positive way is gone. Fuck health, physical and mental. I hate myself, body and mind.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Suicide is always there</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-25 04:55:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>like a thunderstorm rumbling in the background, a presence I can always feel hovering. It's the only thing that's always there, even after everyone and everything else I want to count on has gone. The storm is coming for me, and I have no hope left to stop it. I only wish that somehow I could reach out for actual help, or tell the people who really know me why I am going to kill myself. But I am a coward and I know that, so I will never be able to do those things. Maybe someone who knows me will somehow see this after I'm gone. If that happens, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough to weather this storm. I can't take it, and that's not your fault, it's only mine. It has overcome me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm not doing well, and no one here cares</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-26 03:01:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can't blame any of you. I mean, obviously I'm not really in a position to judge others who don't care about my mental health and physical safety - my life is full of intentionally triggering myself and committing various self-abusive acts. I just feel that I need someone else to care because I can't make myself give a shit, and I definitely don't want to worry or scare anyone I actually know. In my mind, that leaves the internet for me to turn to. I get that I can't make random strangers on the internet care about my life when all I do is bitch about how I feel, but my last post here I was in a really bad place, basically crisis mode, and literally no one answered. I'm still here, obviously, but I am so angry with myself and ... I don't even know what/who else ... that I've gotten to a place where I hate myself more than ever and I'm relying on randos to give me a sliver of hope or self-worth to drag on in this stupid life. I had the perfect chance today to slit my wrists in the bathtub, and I definitely came close. I cut. A lot. And no one noticed. I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop of: A) wanting to be left alone to suffer without anyone noticing, B) wanting to come clean to everyone about how I feel, and C) wanting to get to a place so bad that anyone who sees me knows something is wrong. I don't want anyone's pity. I know that this post sounds abrasive and that's not entirely my intention, but I really am angry with myself and at least a little bit with this sub. I don't want any touchy-feely B.S. - that will just make me feel lied to - but I would appreciate if just one person could read this stupid rant and understand why I feel so frustrated. If you've read this far, thanks. I appreciate you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, Cameron! I'm sure your post has you swimming in messages because you seem like a super cool guy. I just wanted you to know that yours is the first post on this sub that has really made me want to reach out to someone, and I'm pretty introverted, so that's no small feat. If you're not already overwhelmed with new convos, I'd be down to talk, just PM me. Have a good one!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've gone off my meds for the last few days, and so far things have not been unbearable. But I just can't force myself to care anymore. Even before I stopped taking my antidepressants I didn't have any motivation to do the most basic things, sometimes things I used to enjoy doing. I just don't see the point in trying to make myself something I'm not anymore. I'm not happy, I'm not healthy, I'm not okay, and I'm probably going to kill myself. What's the point of all of this anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Classes are starting tomorrow and last year was a really rough time for me. I've been doing better lately but am really afraid that school will be overwhelming and things will go downhill. I have fallen into some of my old apathetic habits and while I don't feel as depressed as I became used to in the past year, I have no willpower to take my antidepressants on a regular basis or to force myself to make things better when I'm feeling down. I don't really know what I'm asking for, but this is something that's been weighing on me that I just need to get out there anonymously.</TEXT>
