    <TITLE>Asexual with Sociopathic Tendencies confused**</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-26 07:12:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Guys :) I've always been very confused about my sexuality and recently stumbled across the term os asexuality and realized that it had fit me perfectly in every way :) (like a cozy blanket). But I am very confused regarding the aspect of my romantic feelings. I do not in any way experience sexual attraction and has never experienced sexual attraction towards anyone. But I have developed and liked individuals around me.  #8203; Disclaimer\*\*\* I have sociopathic tendencies diagnosed by therapists due to my childhood and how it had moulded me, no I wasn't born with sociopathic tendencies, and no I'm not sociopathic.  #8203; The problem is, my approach towards individuals romantically has always been the fact that I would not develop a romantic connection unless they had approached first, or if my friends wanted me to date them. As soon as someone responded in feelings, I would completely loose feelings towards the individual, but would date them because thats what people wanted me to do. I always did what others wanted me to do, what I thought was normal for people to feel. I have liked people before (romantically) but I have never ever been interested in someone without one of the reasons listed above happening.  #8203; I don't know, but I find that slightly odd, I don't know if thats normal or not (just recently, I had thought that my sexuality was completely alike to those around me). I was wondering if anyone else experienced something that this?  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YTA, do you treat your friends like how you treat her? You just seem like someone who's taking someone who cares about you for granted. Maybe to fix this for the future to talk to her again, that you think that she's accusing you because of the tones she use. But I think the most important thing to do is for you to understand is that if your situations were flipped, would you like it you simply asked where your significant other was and they snap at you?  #8203; You should talk to her again about what your feeling again, and maybe work on your temper a bit with these small issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My ferrets diet has consisted of Marshalls premium ferret food and I wanted to switch it over to Wysong Digestive support ferret food. Problem is she refuses to touch the Wysong and eats around it. I was thinking; is it okay if I mash up the Marshalls and Wysong in a bowl (90% Marshall 10% Wysong) and then feed it to her? Then slowly reduce the Marshall and increase the Wysong in the paste? Or would a different method be more effective? Leave any tips :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, Recently I adopted my own little guy and have been ecstatic. I posted pictures and videos to show him off :D (as any ferret mom would know the joys of). One of my friends recently contacted me expressing his desire to have a ferret after seeing how adorable mine was. But he was keen on his ferret adopting a vegan diet; which is insanity. I #8217;m trying to talk him out of it; that ferrets might just not be the right pet for him because they are carnivores but he is adamant. He claims he #8217;s seen the research. I #8217;m currently trying to talk him out of it and posted this to prove to him how insane he is being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, I #8217;m very sorry and hope for the best for your health. And secondly I #8217;m talking generally; the average hospital stay in the US is around 10k, IV fluid can cost up to 700$. The average cost of cancer treatments in the US overall would most likely cost over 100k for patient, around 11,000 to 12,000 a month. 2k sounds like a great deal for you and whichever insurance plan you have. But what I #8217;m saying is that the OP is making the right choice in moving her children due to Canada having basically free healthcare and the lower rates of gun violence/discrimination.</TEXT>

Today it turns out she has been tested positive for Helicobacter, corona virus, and mustelae. She #8217;s also at the risk for stomach ulcers. The vet says in this case it #8217;s serious because she has so many at once. It #8217;s only been a month with this little guy and I #8217;m so upset. I #8217;m not ready to say goodbye. I don #8217;t know really why I #8217;m posting this on this sub, I just don #8217;t know how to deal with my emotions currently. Sorry if this makes dampers people #8217;s moods.

    <DATE>2020-01-30 02:01:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had my ferrets on Wysong digestive support after switching them from the Marshalls ferret food (horrible) and am planning on trying to convert them over to raw. Im thinking of adding [Wysong Ferret Archetype Rabbit Formula ](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00L72K0J6/ref=crt_ewc_title_huc_1?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1 amp;smid=ASGD7DLWRNXF9) and quail slowly into their diets mixed with the digestive support food. Then slowly transitioning to all raw diet. I was wondering if it would be better if I switched them first to the regular wysong first? Or would that not matter? I was also wondering what would be put into the raw diet? I can't really find that much consistent information online. Should I mince it all or should I give it to them as is? Should I rotate the meat that's given to them?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ferret refuses raw meat after throwing up</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-29 12:57:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, So I #8217;ve had my ferret obi on raw meat for almost a month now; doing good. But recently he #8217;s had an incident and been diagnosed with heliobactor; he has ulcers in his stomach and was throwing up blood the other night. (I rushed him to the emergencies and he #8217;s now on proper medication) Issue is; after that incident he REFUSES to eat the raw meat; I #8217;ve tried chicken, rabbit, every kind but he refuses. I tried to give him a tiny bit of his old ferret food (wysong) and he is happy eating it. Does anyone have any advice? I don #8217;t really want him on the wysong since all my ferrets are on raw; should I wait until he #8217;s better again to try and transition back? Super confused right now</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Birth control that increases sex drive</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-03 05:00:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been on birth control for maybe 4 years now. Started on the patch but recently went off of it (it basically completely killed my sex drive to the point where I felt like I was asexual I #8217;m not going to lie) I started on brevicon because my doctor had suggested it after hearing my issues with the patch but this also doesn #8217;t seem that effective (better then the patch but still not that good). I do want sex now but I miss the days where I was off birth control When I was completely birth control free for a week or two in between the switch; I felt my sex drive literally SKYROCKET. I felt normal again??? Like how someone my age should feel (I #8217;m currently 18) I #8217;m thinking of switching again but I was wondering which birth control brands for you guys worked the best in maintaining or boosting ur sex drive?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ferrets only eating if I hand feed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-19 08:30:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got my ferrets to raw a few months ago and they were fine on it. But then I realized that they were slowly more reluctant to eat unless I hand fed it to them (they wouldn #8217;t touch the food bowl). It #8217;s not that they aren #8217;t hungry; or that they don #8217;t like the food; they just WONT touch it unless I feed it to them. When I do feed them they eat until there #8217;s no tomorrow. The issue is; currently it #8217;s fine since were all staying at home but soon I will have to start going out again and the currently system wouldn #8217;t be practical anymore. I #8217;ve tried just not feeding them for the day but they just not eat the entire day. Sometimes they will go to the bowl to get a nibble but nothing substantial Can anyone help me? Is this just a bad habit? Should I just leave them alone and wait until their hungry enough to get it themselves?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Landlord is making me pay additional move out fees (Vancouver, BC, Canada)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 19:58:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently moved out of my apartment and had informed my landlord that the scheduled check would be on March 31st. The entire month of March he was aware that I wasn #8217;t living at the apartment anymore and that I was currently in the process of moving out. Everything was fine and done until this month. He informed me that I needed to pay 200 to him due to me not informing strata of my move out. (Which he never told me I needed to do). I told him that it was his problem if he had forgotten to inform strata and I had originally told him my move out inspection date. (So h #233; knew I was moving but never told me I needed to tell strata) Then he texted me again today informing me that I needed to pay ANOTHER 200$ due to moving without scheduling. Are you supposed to move everything in one day? I didn #8217;t book a special elevator for my move; or anything. My landlord was FULLY aware that I was moving and not living at the location way before March 31st. Do I legally have to pay the 400$ if he didn #8217;t inform me of anything and was fully aware that I had been moving? My roommate also moved out but he isn #8217;t charging her the extra 200 even though they had done exactly what I had done? Could he be targeting me since my parents aren #8217;t helping me move and hers are the ones dealing with it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Carnivora grinds ISSUE</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-27 06:43:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I have two ferrets that are on Carnivora raw grinds. They rotate meats everyday to ensure a proper balance. They recently ran out of food so I went out to buy 3 new packs; for some reason both of them WONT touch the patties at ALL. One of my ferrets is a glutton; will basically eat anything but won #8217;t touch this at all. I thought maybe it was that particular patty so I tried rabbit instead and they won #8217;t eat it either. I #8217;m worried that there #8217;s something wrong with the supplier or the meats because this is extremely unusual of garret to not eat. I #8217;m sure it #8217;s not because they aren #8217;t healthy because when I got them eggs they gobbled it up. Have you guys heard anything about CARNIVORA? What should I do? Are there any balanced grinds that you guys would recommend? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Correlation Between Insulinoma and Improper Diet (Ferretvite, low protein, sugar, grains)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-31 01:52:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys! It has recently come to my attention that some in this ferret community are confused between if they should or should not feed their little fuzzies ferretvite treats and what treats they can feed! I thought that I could share some insight in my ferrets diets and give some sources + links on what they should be getting and some of the side effects if not fed a proper diet. I realize that it is easy for new ferret owners or just trusting pet lovers to fall for these vitamin pastes that are marketed as snacks. But the truth is that your ferret should NEVER be getting these sweet treats, ferrets do NOT need sweet treats (as much as they seem to love them). Ferretone actually has BHA  amp; BHT!! Which are known to cause cancer! I know that all ferret owners want their noodles to live long healthy lives, so it is important to stop feeding these kind of pastes! These pastes are high in sugar which the ferrets digestive systems lack a cecum which means that they CANNOT digest carbohydrates/cellulose. "Since fuzzies are unable to digest carbs, the primary problem is even though those carbs pass through, the body continues to TRY and digest them. Meaning the pancreas is constantly being called upon to secrete insulin to counteract the sugars. That #8217;s what causes the hyper-stimulation of the pancreas and why the tumors form." - quoted from [source](https://holisticferretforum.com/health/insulinoma-2/correlation-between-insulinoma-and-improper-diet/) If you are in need of treats to feed your ferret for training or whatever purposes, I suggest Salmon oil! The grizzly brand salmon oil, dried meats, egg YOLKS, etc etc. I used to feed my two ferrets Wysong 90 Digestive ferret food, before switching them over to a raw diet of duck, rabbit, bison, turkey. They get 4 proteins a week and an egg, with a few licks of salmon oil. After switching them over I've noticed that they smell less, are more hyper, their poops smell a lot less and are more formed. Price wise, its the same as feeding kibble! Wysong is 70-80$ a bag while raw is around 20 a bag. I use Carnivora raw grinds which are nutritionally whole as they grind the entire animal! I understand that some ferrets are very very stubborn towards switching and anyone who wants can contact me and I can help them through this! Or you can sign up for the holistic ferret forum for some mentor program advice!

    <TEXT> gt;Because I'm a vet, and you know what I'm tired of? People thinking that because they've owned something for years or because they claim to be an expert, YOU AREN'T AN EXPERT. If you had citable, peer reviewed sources for every single one of your claims I refuted, I would listen. Instead, your source is someone with no medical background promoting holistic medicine, which has problems of its own.  gt;  gt;My final note is this. Your vet is not your enemy. Why in the hell would we want to go into a profession that literally pays only 20-25% of what an MD makes and have the same amount of debt? Because we're money hungry and just want to make money off of people's pets and that we don't care about your pets? You're lying to yourself. Did you know that veterinarians are 2-3x MORE likely to commit suicide than the entire community of all doctors combined? Did you know that vets suffer from the most mental illnesses out of any other profession because of compassion fatigue, emotional AND physical abuse by clients, and LITERALLY will torture themselves thinking and crying themselves to sleep that they lost that one kitten or that one ferret no matter how much they tried to save it?  gt;  gt;Yeah, we're the heartless ones. We don't care about your pets. We only want your money.  gt;  gt;I started following this sub because I literally just wanted to see cute ferret stuff. I eventually saw a post where my partner was attacked over fucking ferret dental sticks. This post. This post right here is my line. Block me, ban me whatever from the sub. None of you are going to even take this into consideration anyway. I have never listed in any of my points anything bad about vets, I have watched many ted talks etc to educate myself on a vets life. I love my vet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Raw diets are not as good as everyone loves to think that they are. Besides the fact that when doing these diets, you literally have to calculate the various major, minor and trace proteins, fats, fiber, carbs, vitamins and minerals. It's a lot of fucking work, and it isn't easy to say the least. I'm sure your ferrets ARE doing well on the diet, but a lot of that can be our own skewed views when we have our own inherent biased to believe that we are doing something better for them when we aren't. Pelleted/kibble diets exist for a reason. They can mass produce a diet that is balanced in all of the macro, micro and trace requirements by getting ingredients in mass quantities for acceptable prices that we do not have access to. Long story short on this: raw will never cost less than kibble, and if it does, you're doing it wrong. Im on a raw diet that was approved by my vet, and it is not cheaper then kibble, it costs maybe 5-10 dollars more per month then it is for me to buy Wysong kibble. Im not sure why you are being so aggressive dude</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You are right about sugar overload contributing to insulinomas. Increased levels of sugars in a ferrets diet can create an overstimulation to the pancreas, which causes the pancreas to secrete more insulin so the sugars can be absorbed and utilized. The overstimulation is thought to cause a rapid degradation and replication of the beta cells in the pancreas. With the increased turn over of cells, replication takes on a much faster approach. Faster replication means there's a greater chance for genetic errors. Too many genetic errors, you can end up with a cancer of some type, i.e. an insulinoma.  gt;  gt;Fish oils are very good for your ferrets. They're actually really useful for humans too. They provide tons of omega-3 fatty acids which are great for a number of things (decreasing inflammation, helping with joint factors, making your skin healthier, I could go on). I think this kind of makes my point that excess sugar could attribute to Insulinoma; not sure why this post has such a problem when all I want is owners to be aware of this and try and steer clear of these vitamin pastes etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t quite understand your argument. But I also can #8217;t refute it since I would be seen as stubborn but I #8217;m going to try. The person replied saying that a higher amount of sugar does lead to cases of insulinoma, etc etc and then said a positive to the fish oils This does in a way support my argument that these pastes with the amount of sugar that #8217;s in them are not good for them. I #8217;ve gotten my ferrets diet approved by my vet and breeders, and to be completely honest I do think that this is the best kind of diet for them. The  #171; #160;holistic #160; #187; ferret forum is just people who believe in a natural raw diet for their ferrets. And is very understanding and helpful to anyone who wants to transition their ferrets. I #8217;ve seen zoo keepers etc talk about how ferrets should be on a raw diet. Im not going to lie, my post wasn #8217;t supposed to be this argumentative; it #8217;s just stating the fact that excess sugar ISNT good for them, and listed some healthy alternatives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im very sorry if my post triggered a frustration about your industry, but that wasn #8217;t what I was going for. I just wanted people to be aware that excess sugars are bad for their ferrets. Someone messaged me today saying that they feed their ferrets maybe a teaspoon of it twice a day and with food and that theyre fuzzies are experiencing symptoms of insulinoma everytime she gives them the paste. It really concerned me and I wanted to make this post so that other owners are aware that these products that are marketed for ferrets aren #8217;t always good for them. And listed some healthy alternatives to these products.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-11 09:08:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to play this horror game (set in Asia perhaps japan) The protagonist was a young high school girl who arrives at a new town. There is a scene where a girl dies by jumping in front of a train; a quest where you should feed a cat milk so that later on it chases away the killer. People at the school just kept dying. The ending was that there were clones of the protagonist in an underground lair? And it ended with the protagonist going out of the hospital. It #8217;s one of those games where there #8217;s text and u get to chose what you do with pictures in the background I played this game awhile back and it kills me that I have forgotten the name.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had the same problem, I eventually had to move her house to the bottom, and then make sure there are no ladders connecting from her house to other places (I know very annoying) but the "walking Alice home" wouldn't trigger at all (she was already at her house) You have to dock at a shop at around evening time so that Annie is out of the boat at the shop shopping. then when u board the ship again (EVENING) the event should be triggered</TEXT>
