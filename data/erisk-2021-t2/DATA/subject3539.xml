    <TEXT>Welcome to the Takedown meta my friend. Personally, I'm putting this game aside until the patch it again. My record has taken a beating this season and I can't be bothered with continually getting driven to the cage and taken down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hold Right Trigger and then the input for the lead uppercut. PS = R2 (hold) + Square + X Xbox = RT (hold) + A + X For me it's so useful for creating space and keeping aggressive fighters away from me. I don't see it used often if at all online.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This post is just about the presentation. Gameplay wise, it's different but will take some time to get used to. I am however highly disappointed by ground game's "rework" - it screams lazy in my opinion. It needed a thorough rework. \-- The people at the top don't know this game's audience at all. Highly disappointing. 1. Tekken / Street Fighter-esque fighter selection. 2. Star ratings for each fighter to dumb it down for kids under 10 years old. 3. Mortal Kombat face offs once the fighter has been selected. 4. Bruce yelling once both fighters have been confirmed. Lol, why? 5. Taunts when being simply asked by Herb if "you're ready?"... The taunts will no doubt be micro-transactions to purchase. 6. Flashing red graphics when rocked. Who the hell asked for this?! 7. Fourth-wall breaking commentary... You have DC asking the player with the controller to "stop going for takedowns and mash some buttons instead". 8. Selectable celebrations at the end. Again, who asked for this?! 9. A very "arcadey" UI in general - so many bright colours. Doesn't look professional at all. \-- Really not a fan of the direction the game has taken and will for sure lose a few hardcore MMA fans who lean towards a simulation. I'm also not sure this game will attract the type of demographic it's clearly geared towards considering it's completely different in game design to Tekken, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. I'm also not sure it will attract the kids they're after considering it's an 18 game. Bit confused and disappointed. If I want to play an arcade fighter, I load up my MK11 and not UFC 3 ffs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His actions had a profound effect on the Jewish community (and population) and will therefore offend them most. There are also other types of CAFs that can be made which will offend blacks, Asians, East-Asian and even whites. I just want to see the same type of banning applied. I saw way too many offensive CAFs in UFC 3 that seemingly went unpunished.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Making the clinch undeniable in this game was a big mistake.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-24 07:55:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the next patch, they need to insert some sort of input to deny it. Sways, keeping distance and intercepting with strikes only works for a certain amount of time. If a clinch spammer wants you in the clinch to spam knees and standing guillotine, by hook or by crook he'll get you. So then naturally, you'll want to fight fire with fire and the game then becomes a clinchfest. It was a big mistake to make this mechanic undeniable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In short. Reached A Safety Rating and now I cannot for the life of me find an ranked lobby. It seems to match make, it uses a combination of both your Skill Rating (current Silver) and your Safety Rating. So my combination must not be one with a lot of racers, if at all none. So it looks like the next race I find myself in, I'll have to deliberately cut all corners to get my Safety Rating back down to at least B which I found lobbies in. Anyone else have this issue?</TEXT>
