    <TEXT>Hm. I wouldn't say not as "good" necessarily but certainly more risky. Instead of it coming from a sterile lab it may be coming from some barred out moron in a basement with shakey hands and a pill press who may have accidentally dropped one too many grains of fentanyl into one random pill that ends up killing someone. Stay safe man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your worries. I especially relate to the "not feeling my problems are big enough to be in treatment". But I think we have to understand that you honestly dont even need a reason to go to therapy. It's simply for that person to get better, or at least be able to vent and talk to someone who can try to help them out. I would like to add though, that we both have attempted suicide, and while you dont *need* a reason, I think we have a pretty good one haha. Also understand that therapy is no miracle cure. You need to do some work too. I'm honestly in a horrible place rn and in no place to give much advice, but I think that the stuff I said is hopefully helpful. Good luck friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know what? I've can never find the words to accurately portray how I feel day to day, and this is pretty much perfect. Like some days I think I'm literally disabled. I can barely get 2 sentences out half the time because now I stutter, repeat myself for some reason, and can never think of words which is the most annoying one honestly. I feel like when I have a longer conversation with a stranger they can tell I'm slow and I've done it to myself I think. Thank u stranger  lt;3 I hope u get some peace of mind soon..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so sorry you feel this way. I can definitely relate to some of the things you said. However, I would like to suggest that you try your absolute hardest to try and stick it out with the psychiatrist. Maybe even talk to a therapist? If not that's ok. I understand not wanting to see one. Not wanting to get better and just give up and die is something I think about often honestly. Tonight especially actually. I find most of my therapy sessions unuseful and stupid. But there are still things they **can** help you with. Even if it's not something big or life changing or revolutionary. I have faith that you can slowly pick up the pieces and live the only thing you know in this universe. Life. Whether it be the most evil thing to exist or the most blissful thing anyones ever known. It's all we got. I beg you. At least try and experience it. Even just for a little longer. That's what I'm trying to do. Trying as much as possible. I honestly cried while writing this. Its for you and partly for myself haha. Good luck stranger. Try and take it easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it a disease? I've always thought about addicts as bad people honestly. It's because of my family. They told me how addicts make the choice themselves and that its entirely up to that person. If you didnt want to be an addict you simply should've "never tried it". "It's their own fault". But now that I'm in this position I'm beginning to wonder. Doesnt change the fact that I hate myself for it. But deep down i know I'm not bad. I deeply care for people. Just not myself. Like how tf did I end up like this. I'm 19 and my parents already begged me to go to rehab once but I refused. I do have outside help in that I have 2-3 therapy sessions a week. I've been lying to them about being sober. I'm thinking about confessing today but I dont know what will happen if I do. Probably nothing good.</TEXT>

It certainly was in the beginning but now it's got a hold. And I kinda am accepting help I just dont know how to stop. Its definitely humiliating to think I might be going to a suboxone clinic or something soon. Idk it was suggested by my addiction counselor. But yeah I have that problem too. Half the days I think it's fine and I'm managing it well, and the other half I desperately wish I could just stop. I'm tired of keeping pushing. I dont see the point anymore tbh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been through some pretty rough benzo withdrawls before. I think I had a seizure in my sleep. And also one when I took tramadol while in withdrawal. Super scary. And as I read this, I'm horrified and I just dropped 3 drops of my clonazolam solution on some watermelon and ate it. This will be the third night in a row i did it. I'm falling into the habit again. Fuck.. I had two drops last night and one this morning. Its strong as fuck. I'm thinking I'll do two drops tomorrow night. Maybe two the next night? Then one. Then one. Then none. Or should I just cold turkey and not stretch this shit out? This rc benzo is known for producing bad withdrawls too since it's so strong. Oh my...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man I'm feelin good. Lemme tell u a fuckin story. One night I was coming down to last of what benzos I had left. My parents hadn't caught me yet but I was in deep with the addiction. I had 3 .5mg clon pills and like 10 xans (I think they were etiz presses). Anyways I took two of the clon pills. Then I took the third since I "wasn't feeling it". Well let me tell u. I woke up in the morning. To my mom. Asking me why I was mowing the grass. In POURING rain. I said something like "what? it's illegal to mow in the rain now?" And she was like "shut the fucking lawn mower off and get in the house". Long story short. I took everything. Total blackout. Anything could have happened. Clonazolam is a very potent benzo. Be careful. You literally must exercise self control or it will end so bad. The consequences of that blackout incident were NOT fun. Stay lit but stay safe yall lmao</TEXT>

Apparently my friend knew my account and was worried about me. He told her my username. I didnt have anything hidden. It was all in the open. This was my absolute nightmare. Now my parents could read all about what I thought, felt, and did on a daily basis. It was horrible. These were my darkest days. I'm still in those days but my god that didnt help.

"Oh you just need to get your sleep schedule better." "Oh its not that bad just keep pushing". "It gets better". Does it? Will all these things magically go away once I quit the drugs and fix my sleep schedule? No. Itt doesnt go away. It never gets easier. This is for life. And life is not for me. I wish this was a goodbye note but I haven't worked up the nerve to try and kill myself again. I dont like how it effected everyone last time. Now I feel like I'm stuck here.

We actually went to the mall today and I got some stuff, and we skated for a few hours. I'm new to it but it's fun and it's something physical. A few of my neighbors were unhappy because of their preconceived ideas of "skaters" and we honestly look kinda sketchy sometimes.

The more you take less melatonin works. I've been looking into it for a while and talked to couple doctors about it because I was curious about melatonin effectiveness. Since I never noticed getting tired from it. Well. U gotta take like 2.5mgs. The lowest I could find @ the store was 5mg that I break in half. I'm telling you!

    <TEXT>Yeah definitely. I have 2 therapists but we dont really get anywhere because I just dont change. I keep doing drugs. I keep burning myself. I keep telling myself how much of a bad person I am. I get all in my head and nothing ever changes. Idk where to start. Theyre probably gonna be frustrated with me pretty soon. I don't even wanna get better anymore. I haven't for a while. I just wanna give up. I dont know how to communicate that to someone with them hearing that I'm suicidal. Because I'm NOT getting locked up in one of those crazy fucking mental hospitals that are supposed to "help". Fuck that.</TEXT>

At the end of the day, we are sick. Something we never ever asked for, but its here and we have to fight everyday. It gets so tiring. You stop seeing the point. Withdraw from people. Believe it or not, I think you are normal. The fact I can relate so closely says that. We can make it. I dont know how, but I hope we can find a way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fuck man yeah taking benzos for weeks in bound to give bad withdrawls. In fact Bezos withdrawls can and will kill you. In fact, I'd recommend doing a little research on any drug youre gonna do for a while or even just try. It's better to be safe than sorry. Scary and many people say they are far worse then any opiate withdrawal. It kinda depends on the person though. Anyways, if I were you and fixed on taking that .25 I would make sure that you space the doses out good. I believe taking them 3 days in row and then quitting is always gonna give much worse symptoms than 1 or 2 days. I do understand things happen and panic attacks happen so popping in an emergency is honestly not that big of a deal. My case is because I'm an idiot addict lmao. I think you should be fine. Xans are nothing to mess around with tbh. Just be careful and mindful of dosageing. Also, if you're still going through it rn and have weed, smoke that shit. Itll help  #129315;</TEXT>

The cops were behind us in the drive through, we were young as fuck, and it was like 3am. I freaked the fuck out. Blacked out lol. Snapped out of it at 6am and then realized what all just happened. From remembering what all happened and the visuals of my neighbors house looking like all these different faces of people from every walk of life. Black kids and old white ladys. It was beautiful actually. Really beautiful. I thought I was them (everybody) and I cried while it was happened. Wild shit haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly? In my opinion that are hard drugs. I understand one tab will kick ur ego a little maybe and make everything beautiful and amazing. And it might change your life for the better and that's amazing. But they are still incredibly powerful and can cause *serious* issues for people. I think you need to be careful and make sure your mind is right going into it. That's necessary. And it's why I've barely tripped at all this year haha. Just my 2 cents for the people that think psychedelics are an all knowing all giving natural cure to anything and everything. Give it a fucking break. Edit- pls note I'm all for psychedelics and I think they should be legalized and people should be more educated on them. Most of the bad shit you hear about psychedelics is from stupid people who just decided to eat a bunch of the shit one night and end up in psych ward or something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yesterday I texted. They helped me. I texted my best friend like they said i should and it was fine. I calmed down. I dont know how I got to this point. 19yr drug addict loser. I cant see my future. I dont think I have one. I'm fucking pathetic. I just realized how lonely I really am. I haven't had a dream in months. Last night I passed out before I could smoke since I took benedryl, melatonin, a decent amount of xans, and my trazadone. So. I have this dream that I'm in a mental hospital. It's not one I've been to before thank god because fuck those were bad. Anyways, theres this girl in there and I notice her right away in the dream. She ends up in my room somehow and she just hugs me. Somehow theres a tv in the room and we just hold each other and that's it. This would never happen in real life but the dream was so nice. There was nothing even sexual. It was just comforting. Im so pathetic. Who has dreams where they simply hug someone and they wake up and cry because that's all they want? Fuck. I'm sorry I need to vent. I dont want to hurt myself anymore. I dont want to use drugs anymore. I'm going to lose everyone.  amp; there's not much to start with. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hm. Some people can handle it and some cant. I am quite educated about drugs, the risks, dosaging for many things, etc. I am also an addict both physically and mentally. If you can avoid drugs.. then do. Psychedelics may be ok but that about it. Psychedelics and weed. But you can still get addicted to weed easily. Psychedelics not so much. Either way. Depending on the person, drugs can *definitely* be bad.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice please... might be tapering off a potent benzo.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-24 17:28:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I smoke weed morning, day  amp; night. I'm taking 6 to 7 drops of a clonazolam solution a day. Thats about 750ug of clon or 2.5-3mg of alprazolam. Which by itself doesnt sound *that* bad, but clon is a very hard hitting, quick acting powerful and hypnotic benzo. The with withdrawls are horrible. If I don't even a little I get violent withdrawal symptoms. I also take trazadone 75mg @ night if that's important. I ordered a 60 count of 250mg phenibut capsules because I heard they can help. I dont even know if my psychiatrist is willing to help me yet. But if he does I'm not sure how he'll even decide how to taper me. I told him of etizolam once  amp; he was like "wtf is that". Anyways. If anyone could tell me a ballpark of how I should dose I'd love to hear because this is coming up quick and I have no clue. Thank you :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think we should be helping the kids. Not with hiding or dosaging, but insisting the danger that follows is not worth it. maybe sell them even? Thats a last resort I'm sure but if you can get them to not take them that's awesome. Im not sure. But unfortunately this is not a new thing. I'm 19 now but I sure as hell was on here when i was 15 and it probably saved my life. I'm not defending or promoting kids using drugs, because that's fucked. But this is nothing new. Kids have been getting fucked up for ages. I say we *educate* them. Not condemn them. Because how does that end? Never good. Say what you will but that is the reality of it. And theres nothing you can do. So maybe stop complaining and do something about it. I feel like the mods do their job appropriately. I'm sure they've deleted posts from 10 yr old asking about heroin or some shit. Kids are just crazy man. Theres nothing you can do but try and help.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-28 19:02:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alright this was a couple of days ago. I'm hooked hard on this clonazolam. I picked up some diclazepam to try and taper down. Anyways heres the story: One night I took about 5 or 6 drops of my solution. My tolerance is getting up there but at the time 6 drops was enough to black out a bit for sure. So. This is around 11pm. I'm in my bed and I just pass out no harm no foul. Then I'm jerked awake by my brother. I hazily get my bearing and find my phone (behind my bed of course). I look at the time and its 9 o'clock the next day. My brother leaves and I look on my bed (I was laying on one). 3 pills. 3 40mg vyvanse capsules. No one in my family is prescribed these. No one I know is perscribed these. I wasnt missing any money. I checked all around my room and nothing was out of place. But now I got some vyvanse I guess. What the fuck guys this stuff is scary not fun anymore  #128517; #128556;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah let me know man. I'm getting some diclazepam Monday that should help me taper off hopefully fairly easily. On a bad day I'll take like 1mg of clonazolam a day. Which is a lot imo because the shits soo potent. I have a plan though. I think. I'll have to write down how I'm going to taper and then just follow it no pussy shit I'm gonna push through. I've done it before. Also I'm currently in need of a new psychiatrist. I told my current one *everything* that was going on to a tee. He basically said he wont prescribe me anything to help me. Hes been a dickhead from the start and thought I was on 4 medications. I'm on fuckin 1. Also calls routinely calls me 15 minutes late. Anyways yeah now I have to go to the streets and do the shit on my own. Why becomes a doctor if you aren't willing to help? Good luck man hope your taper goes as smooth as it can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd recommend staying *away* from the extremely potent research benzos like flualp, clam, clonazolam, etc. In all honesty they're just too strong, too addictive, and just too dangerous overall. The psychical withdrawls will literally kill you and if they dont it's still absolutely hell. Currently very hooked on the clon. Wish me luck ;(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh wow that's an interesting method. The way I was gonna try and taper was with diclazepam. Its gonna be miserable either way, but diclaz is less potent and hopefully I go lower slowly with that after a taper down as low as possible with the clon. Clon is so powerful u legit cant taper off it with just itself. You gotta get shit that's less potent lmao.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm getting desperate. I'm ruining my life. Clonazolam.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-04 03:40:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been taking 8 to 12 drops of clonazolam (dont confuse with clonazepam) a day. Aka 1mg-1.5mg a day. I've researched a lot and general consensus is 3 or 4 times more potent than alprazolam. So basically about 3.5mgs of xanax a day. Doesnt sound like much but the thing is..... this shit is *potent*. Hits quick and very fast. Most euphoric benzo by far. Anyways, the withdrawls are absolute fucking hell on earth. My therapist wants me to call a detox center with her this Wednesday. I'm reallyyyy scared because they cold turkey you there. I'm getting to the point where I almost want to go. But I also definitely fucking dont. She says they'll give me anti seizure meds. I asked about hallucinations and she had no idea. I I them one time when I quit by myself. Thought I was gonna die lmao.  amp; she said it'd take a week. But it wont just take a week. Fuck idk what to do man I'm 19 what the fuck I feel like I cant trust these people. I've had bad experiences in specifically metal hospitals before. Anyone have advice? If you do I'd *love* to hear. Thanks</TEXT>

My general doc. might but still the drs around here are *very* reluctant to prescribe any gaba acting drug to an addict. I have some phenibut but I'm staying away from that for now. Gonna have to look into valerian and see if I can grab some quick. I just hope they actually want to help me and do the right thing. Some of these "medical professionals" are just idiots dressed with a big ego. Only concern is how many nurses they can fuck not the wellbeing or safety of the people who genuinely need help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dont mix xans with any opiate honestly. It will cause respiratory depression and you can easily stop breathing. It happened to me once but I had a giant ass cup of juice with ice in it in my hands when I fell out. Woke up with warm juice all over me but I was laying on the ice cubes and I think that's what woke me up. Also puked all over and somehow didnt choke on it. Just came home from rehab today lmao. Not worth it in my opinion. Stay safe</TEXT>

Fuck. Idk. I just need to vent. I just wanna scream. Fucking cravings suck. I dont wanna disappoint everyone... again. And my dad told me he'd beat the shit outa me if I relapsed.

I just dont wanna get a case of the fuck it's one night and ruin everything. I have told myself drugs are no longer an option for me. Just like suicide. No longer an option. But even in rehab I had those thoughts creep in and then I'd feel like shit for 4 days and eventually recognize my thinking was going back to the old way. And kinda turn it around. It's just different when I'm back in my city and my mind gets racing. I'm trying my absolute hardest though. Thanks again. These comments are really helping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly couldn't give a shit about my dads threats. We are about the same size. Hes definitely stronger than me but if he attacks me its fuckin on. Also yeah I was doing xanax, then etizolam, then clonazolam (an extremely potent research chem. It's a benzo). I was also taking tramadol for a few months. Then switched to hydros for a few weeks and then percocet for a few months. Ended up getting some fake 30s that were completely fentanyl. I overdosed once because of the respiratory depression I think. So i was then mixing benzos, opiates, and either vyvanse or adderall to keep my body going. I was up to about an equivalent of 8mg of xanax a day. I kicked the opiates some fucking how and the uppers (I hate uppers) about two weeks before I got to rehab. The taper was 7 days and I still wanna pull my fucking teeth out and crawl out of my skin. I'm still shakey lmao. Fucking miserable. I think getting my medical card would really help. I think I could get by relatively easier with just weed. At this point though I dont know. I also stached all my shit away in my attic so I still have a bunch of stuff in the attic. This is fucked but I'm trying my hardest to keep away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't worry my friend. Neuroplasticity is a thing and your brain will return to normal. I was taking Xanax and clonazolam (a VERY potent benzo) for about a year everyday. I just got home from rehab and I know all too well what you're going through. Do not. I repeat do not go back to benzos. It will only prolong the time it takes for your brain to heal itself. Unfortunately there's not much you can do about this other than wait. Although maybe look into lions mane mushrooms. They are said to help the brain in many ways. Good luck and stay strong. You got this.</TEXT>

Tonight I just smoked a shit ton out of a cart and I'm high as fuck. But in rehab I told all the staff I wasn't giving up weed and everyone there shrugged their shoulders and said "it's just weed". I get its just weed but I'm still faded asf and I have some pills near. I'm already think to my self "just one night" but I know I'm lying to myself. Id go right back to using heavy.

    <TEXT>Last night I had a horrible time. I even had a relatively good day and worked for the first time in forever and got some money. Paid under the table so she gave me cash. Well... lemme tell you. If I didn't immediately go get some diclazepam and a cart. I get home and mindlessly go take double of all my sleep meds. Take massive rips of 92% thc and 1mg of the diclaz. Woke up after a crazy ass haze of weird dreams and not knowing what happened and if I was awake or not. I know for sure I was awake once. But I think I just got some food or something. Why did i do this. It wasn't even that fun although I did feel pretty good. I had a month clean. Im 19 and if I keep going with this cycle I'm getting fucking nowhere in life.

    <TEXT>Well clonazolam is definitely the most euphoric benzo there is so no promises. But .5mg was always a decent sedative and I could easily fall asleep in 10 minutes or less.

    <TEXT>I had an interview today. I've been a jobless drug addict bum for about a year now. And I threw it away. I got dressed, prepared, and went to the place. I then puke as soon as i get in the parking lot. And start crying. I dont know why. Cant explain. But i sat there. In front of this place while my interview was supposed to be going on. I just sat. Paralyzed. I watched the front of the store for a good 15 minutes. Then drove away. How fucking pathetic and disgusting can I be? Jesus I hate myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I'm scared im not functional or mentally able to do a job again. My mind skips beats and chatters and most of the time does absolutely nothing. I just sit and stare. Absolutely nothing on my mind. Its from the drugs. They said it could take years to come back since I'm so young and abused so much (still am....). I just pulled up, prepared to step out of my car, and puked. Then I felt like I couldn't breathe and it was over. I dont think I could've even held a short conversation at that point. He probably would've just thought I was fucked up and kick me out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah i actually got a call shortly after I got home and it was for a different job. Better paying and the interview is online. Its like a real second chance for me. But even if I get it I hope they don't drug test me. Because ill fail like always and its just a vicious cycle of being a peice of shit. But thank you. I'm honestly feeling really low today tho. Going through withdrawals because I need to get clean again. Plus I drank 3/4 of a bottle of whisky last night and went and drove golf carts all over this range. So that didn't help much. Its just another day of me being sad sick hot cold frustrated hateful and overwhelmed but empty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Say for a nice day. A person might walk outside. Its their day off. No worries or chores or bills or obligations weighing their mind. They breathe in some fresh air. The sky is blue. Stripped with faint clouds drifting by. The temperature is perfect and comfortable. Theres birds chirping and the sun is shining and there's a cool light breeze. Theres vibrant flowers growing, gently swaying with the wind while honeybees buzz around. Collecting the sweetness and fueling the beauty. This person smiles. This is life. And its great. Then I walk outside. I take a breath in. I see the flowers. I feel the sunlight and hear the birds and the grass is green and the sky is blue. I'm observing all the same things. But its different. The flowers are less vibrant. The sun less bright. Yet it scolds. Not gently shines down. I look at the grey spots in the grass. The birds are annoying. The honeybees are a bother. Maybe some days I dont even feel the breeze on my face. My shoes are a little too tight. The shirt fits just wrong. Birds are faint in the background. Almost like white noise. And there's a deadly silence. And a hollow chest. And my own skin feels foreign. Even dogs know. You now they say dogs are the best judge of character? My dog hates me. Her eyes don't light up when they see me. No tail wags. She looks the other way. I look the other way. And my ghostly existence floats to my bedroom. Where I spend my time looking at the intricacies of my carpet. And getting unimaginably intoxicated on various combinations of who knows what. So from an outside observer, I'm just a mean arrogant miserable person. Rare to catch me even smirk. And I sure as hell won't be doing anything with any passion or interest. My interests are drugs. Porn. And thinking existentialially about everything. I go months without even thinking about myself. Of who I am or what I wanna be or do. Maybe I dont even exist. I think its possible. Every time I try to die, I live. So whats the difference. The world will continue to cycle. The tides will come in and out. Under the direction of a pale senseless moon. And the sun will come up and down. People will live and die. Always both in the same day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You aren't alone. Are you making any plans to change the nasty habit? There's a lot of great resources online right now. But also you could definitely talk to someone about it in person. I know it isnt easy. Even acknowledging you have a problem is a fantastic first step. Good on u.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got out of rehab yesterday. Thats my 2nd 30 day rehab I completed this year. I'm now living in a recovery house that's halfway between a halfway house and a sober living house. Anyways I'm extremely uncomfortable and overwhelmed and I just wanna go home and get a job and do iop there. I feel like this is just too much. Its all new experiences and I'm only 20. I turned 20 like 13 days ago. Idk I'm just freaking out here and I hate it so much. Nothing has really been explained to me. Fuck. Fuck this. What should I do? Uhggggg</TEXT>

And yeah im doing better with my parents and stuff. They are happy to see me here but if I still end up not liking this I might just go home and get a job and do iop there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for saying that. You're right. But i also need to get a job within 2 weeks and get a sponsor. And go to meetings everyday and to a therapist and doctor. And theres no reliable transportation. It seems like a LOT. Never done any of this before. If I dont have a job within 2 weeks I have to leave. But im already trying to find one and its my 1st full day here. So I should be fine. But again you're totally right. If I could've done it on my own I would've.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No like I need one within 2 weeks because it's $200 a week and I'm broke and my mom can only pay so much. But thank you thats really good advice. Obviously you've been through it and I haven't yet so I really appreciate the input. I actually just got a call for an interview because I was going nuts applying to places this morning. I think it'll all work out how its supposed to. It was just this morning that I was having a little panicky freak out. Hence the post haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look into the medication prazosin. It helped me tremendously. I still have nightmares but they are NOWHERE near as vivid or disturbing. I would have dreams of very graphic things happening to me and my family. It felt real. I was in rehab and I was even dreaming about getting high. Then I'd wake up and get pissed because I thought I relapsed and felt high. So I get how terrifying this stuff can be. Really though that medicine does wonders. I've also spoken to multiple other people that take it or took it and they said the same. It really helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recently was talking to a corrections officer who was telling me about how they do this thing where they boil or almost boil baby oil. Then they go out on the yard and throw it into the face or genitalia of the sex offender. Permanently disfiguring or disabling them. He said its the worst burns he's ever seen. And this man did 2 tours in Iraq and then 4 more as a private contractor. I like to think this will happen to him. Can only hope.</TEXT>
