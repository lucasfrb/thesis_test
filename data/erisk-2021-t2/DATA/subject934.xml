    <TEXT>Many of you probably don't know the latter name in this post, because he's fairly irrelevant. But internet celebrity and multimillionaire Jake Paul called him out for cyber bullying kids (which Cody Ko does, and if you say he doesn't you're blind just watch his videos). If a respected person did the exact same thing in confronting Cody, everyone would have praised him. People just responded negatively because they feel some type of way about Jake Paul.

    <TITLE>Trump bringing up Hunter Biden #8217;s drug use history is a new rock bottom for American Politics</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-03 18:18:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the entirety of that shitshow that we the American people have to call our  #8220;presidential debate #8221;, Trump mentioning the drug use and mental health history of Hunter Biden was by far my least favorite part. If you look more into the history of the life Hunter Biden has lived, he was in a car crash where he lost his mother and younger sister, and suffered a childhood brain injury. He then lost his only remaining sibling from Joe #8217;s first marriage to brain cancer when Beau Biden passed in 2015. He has had anything but an easy life, and as someone who personally has had some struggles with substance use I found this to be disgraceful. How can we ever get past the mental health stigma when our president thinks someone #8217;s child #8217;s addiction is a means to discredit them in an argument? Especially when it #8217;s so obvious as to why Hunter happened to turn to drug use? I knew trump was a disgrace, but this is a new low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve taken shrooms three or four times, and the first few times were fine, but my most recent was absolutely terrible. It #8217;s hard to explain but I just had a sense of impending doom the entire time. I lowkey thought I was going to die. I took 4g the last time, which many people have told me is too much, and I want to try it again but I #8217;m worried that even that will turn out badly. I really liked shrooms when I did them and had a good time, but the recent bad time is enough to have me scared to try them again. Any suggestions? Should I give it another shot and try to do things differently? Any answers appreciated please let me know.</TEXT>
