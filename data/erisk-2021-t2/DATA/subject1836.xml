    <TEXT>I absolutely loveee my Womanizer toys. My first purchase was the womanizer premium which combined with penetration is amazing. However, I just bought the womanizer duo, which is just perfect! It has dual stimulation that takes clitoral and g spot simulation to a whole new level! Also when I bought my premium it was included with the We Vibe Sync, which I #8217;m not incredibly crazy about since it #8217;s good for teasing but with the toy alone you can #8217;t really get there... Another toy brand I #8217;ve tried is cheaper but with great quality, Romp. They #8217;re rabbit vibrator is only $40 and well worth it  #128525; Also I love my Nu Sensuelle remote controlled vibrator, tried and true favorite which was the first toy I ever bought  #128521;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sooo I just bought the duo and I also own the premium....I love them both; however, I think it #8217;s important to consider if it #8217;s for solo or partner play. If you want to have some solo relief, the duo is great because you can play around with the speeds and patterns, which are separate btw between the pulsation and vibration. Also it is like the premium in that it stays quiet and only turns on when the nozzle is against something. I love the duo because it #8217;s intense and you can try new combinations. However, if it #8217;s for partner play, maybe go for the premium instead. My boyfriend can finger me while I hold the premium against my clit or you can even hold it while having sex. The premium is also awesome, but personally that g spot stimulation from either the duo or something else (wink wink) takes it all the way ;) You can also buy the premium in a combination deal with the We Vibe Synch on websites like lovers lane or even the womanizer website for $300 with a value of $400 in the  #8220;Tease and Please #8221; package  #128527;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try the Romp brand of toys! Super inexpensive, maybe $40 apiece, and they have quality products that you can try out. I have bought the Romp rabbit vibrator and clit pulsing one. I know that Lovers Lane sells them online. Also my first toy ever is pretty inexpensive and it gets me there even now with my more expensive toys. It #8217;s the Nu Sensuelle remote controlled vibrator for only $41 on Amazon :) https://www.amazon.com/Nu-Sensuelle-Pleasure-Remote-Control/dp/B01M2CRZRO</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have not tried Lelo before; however, I do have a wevibe Sync (not my favorite). Womanizer is just a completely different experience and lower end toys like Romp are still quality products that for example incorporate the patented motor air technology of Womanizer :) Romp toys are sold through places like Lover #8217;s Lane. Also they #8217;re a lot cheaper to try them out before dropping money on the real deal. I caved and bought the duo womanizer after getting the premium and they #8217;re both amazing  #128557;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry you went through something similar. It #8217;s definitely a long road to feeling okay. I was in the abusive relationship for over a year, it #8217;s been almost 5 years now. I #8217;ve been with my current boyfriend for nearly 4 years and I have been so open with him. It #8217;s incredibly important to me that he understand why I might need to work through it slowly. I #8217;ve been medicating for anxiety and depression for over a year and also seeing a therapist during that time. I love him so much and I #8217;ve been so back and forth about feeling ready or thinking maybe I #8217;ll wait to have intercourse until we #8217;re married. We do other things when we make out, but I #8217;m scared that I would have less control and have an anxiety attack as a result. By the way, thank you so much for your kind words. It #8217;s so difficult to feel like I #8217;m some kind of an anomaly or damaged enough to not feel comfortable enough sharing something so special with my partner.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve been with my current partner for nearly 4 years and he has always been aware of my apprehension towards sex. He #8217;s always been supportive of me and he has never made me feel uncomfortable. He has helped me seek help and for the past year I #8217;ve been working with a therapist, as well as taking medication for my anxiety and depression! I #8217;m in such a better place than I was 5 years ago. I even confided in my mom recently and made her aware of the anxieties I have because of past relationships.

I #8217;m trying to figure out what I want to do because reevaluating where I #8217;m at emotionally is always important. It #8217;s been 5 years since I was in that relationship and then assaulted, I #8217;ve been with my amazing boyfriend for almost 4 years, and I #8217;ve been going to therapy consistently once a week for the last year! I think I just want to try and see where I feel both comfortable and fulfilled sexually by going slowly at my own pace. We have done hand jobs, fingering, some oral, but I #8217;ve been so apprehensive of intercourse that I haven #8217;t attempted to cross that line with him. I #8217;m appreciative of him being so respectful of me, but I #8217;m slowly thinking I want to try moving forward a bit. I really appreciate this  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

Thank you so much, no matter what I #8217;ll take it slow  #128149;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks you! I #8217;m glad someone else understand what I #8217;m going through. Your encouragement means a lot. We #8217;ve talked about my experiences and what makes me uncomfortable. It #8217;s really difficult to separate sex from my abuse and assault, even though it would be with someone I love. All of your advice makes perfect sense and I really appreciate it.  #128149; #128149; #128149;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m really sorry you went through something similar! Thank you so much for sharing so I feel less alone. I was hoping everything would be fine, but I think I was kidding myself. I completely understand the part where you feel as though you #8217;re overreacting. I wish it were easier, especially during the pandemic to have better conditions in these situations. I wished someone could hold my hand, ground me. That I could still keep my doctor safe, but not hyperventilated behind the mask. It absolutely sucked because I felt so alone. I wish I didn #8217;t feel so stupid. I really appreciate your comment...I feel supported and a little less alone now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m really sorry that you had to go through something similar. It must have been really hard for you. I think it #8217;s common we put blame on ourselves especially with severe anxiety in these situations. It #8217;s really hard to describe why you ascribe blame to yourself and can #8217;t allow yourself forgiveness. I wish I could get to that place also. I #8217;ve been told it #8217;s important to forgive my abuser and attempted rapist, but I have so much anger and blame still. I wish things came easier. I #8217;m really proud of you for finding the energy to forgive yourself and seek help! You are an amazing person and you deserve all the love in the world, not only from others, but also from yourself  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I somehow feel validated knowing that I #8217;m not alone in all of this. Thank you so much for commenting and helping me brainstorm more ideas  lt;3 I have a female doctor, but it hasn #8217;t helped as much as I #8217;d like. I think I might try to recite lyrics or a poem. I would have never thought of that! I felt so dirty and shaken after the exam, I just didn #8217;t know what to do with myself. It #8217;s good to know that I always have some control to refuse / decline exams. I really appreciate this  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much! Don #8217;t critique yourself too much  lt;3 Art is meant to be subjective anyways. Sometimes the most fun I have is just mixing the paints :) I appreciate your help encouragement. It was really therapeutic to just put into words the way I was feeling and visualize how I want to change all of my negatives into positives  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much! You totally understand what I was trying to do with this piece! I really wanted to separate past from present, that the end result can still be something beautiful. I felt like so many other people might feel these emotions, but when I listed the past it seemed so easy. The future me is going to have all of those wonderful traits and be unafraid to look at my past self. I wanted to show myself I still deserve love  #128149;</TEXT>

It really hurts to feel these things and not feel comfortable enough to share them...I really hope that you find your peace! I believe in you. You could be a poet...I myself have used the waves of trauma as waves. Sometimes I #8217;m worried the next wave will be too much and it will take me under.

    <TEXT>I think I would have done a lot better knowing I had my SO with me to talk to me / hold my hand. The feeling of an anxiety attack, while disassociating is so hard to explain. Maybe try to be open with a friend and tell them what you need. I couldn #8217;t stand not having control of what went inside of me. Maybe try to talk to a therapist before you go? They can try to help you work through it and give you coping mechanisms. Please trust your feelings and don #8217;t push yourself  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I (21f) agreed to having casual sex with my friend (20f), even though we #8217;re both in serious relationships with men. Both SO #8217;s are informed and okay with it. We both want it. Why am I anxious?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 04:51:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Both of us are bicurious. I have never had anything sexual with another female, but she has once with another friend. We #8217;ve always been flirtatious and seemingly into one another, and we both kind of knew the other one wasn #8217;t joking, but we #8217;ve never broached the topic seriously. In the last week it #8217;s gotten  #8220;real, #8221; so to speak. She mentioned to my boyfriend that she really would and wanted to act on it, he told me, and it suddenly went from casual flirtation to a real possibility. We were hanging out and I kissed her today because I just wanted to see what she would say (nothing over the top, more of a quick peck on the lips to break the tension). She said she needed to speak with her boyfriend beforehand, then we could explore things further, but not in a serious way. In short, both of our boyfriends have agreed they are okay with it, it will just be us, and we will have boundaries. So, we #8217;ve both agreed to it. I #8217;m excited, but... The only problem I have is that my anxiety, which is pretty predominant in everyday cases, has become more of a knot in my stomach. There are plenty of reasons why. I struggle with self esteem (body image), I have never been with another female, I have never had casual sex (just in general). If anyone would like to give me some positive advice, I need some more perspective on how to approach my anxiety and casual sex. I want to be excited to explore my sexuality, but I can #8217;t get over the mental hump.</TEXT>
