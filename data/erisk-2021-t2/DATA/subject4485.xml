    <TEXT>Garuda, the *Vahana* of mount of Lord Vishnu also makes an appearance in the epic Ramayana. When the demon king Ravana binds the Princes Rama and Lakshmana with Naag-Phans (a celestial weapon related to the Nagas or serpents) that makes them lose consciousness, the monkey -God Hanuman (the foremost devotee of Rama) invokes the help of Garuda, the king of birds. Garuda is able to break the Naag-Phans and save Rama and Lakshmana. Rama and Lakshmana are worshipped in Hinduism as the Avataras (Reincarnation) of Lord Vishnu and Sheshanaga respectively. (Seshanaga is the Divine Serpent on whom the Lord Vishnu lies and meditates in the midst of kshirsagara-the ocean of milk). Interestingly, in the presence of Lord Vishnu or Narayana, the Garuda , the eagle like king of birds and Seshanaga , the mighty Divine Serpent are at harmony. In might also interest you to know, that there is an entire book or scripture called Garuda-Purana - 1st millennium BCE. Garuda Purana contains 16000 verses about diverse topics such as yoga, ethics, gods, mythology, salvation, karma, rebirth, heaven and hell, types of minerals, list of plants and herbs and more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do not usually reply to religion based questions, but I saw a video from the old Sri Krishna (Ramanand Sagar - hence well researched) tele-series, where a very similar point is being discussed by Arjuna and Krishna. I would like to share the link here. Perhaps you will find some clarity. https://youtu.be/v_obGQql01I Amateur translation (my feeble attempt) : Arujuna : Krishna, it means that to attain Moksha, to free oneself from the bounds of birth, death and rebirth, a man must simply cease to perform any action. One must become a monk or Sanyasi. Krishna: No man can be in the state of inaction. Arjuna: But a monk doesn't work or perform any action. Krishna: Dear Parth, even the monks don't stop performing actions and neither can they do so. Even the monks perform action. Their penances and other sadhanas are also Karma. How can one free himself from Karma? In musical form: Krishna: Inaction is a curse, Karma-yog a blessing. He who does not perform any action is similar to a dead person. Arjuna: If destiny is everything, what is the need for Karma? Krishna: Destiny itself depends on one's Karma. It is your Karma, that forms your destiny. This is the law of Karma. Arjuna: If one has no right over the fruit (of your actions) , why to plant the seed (of Karma) in the first place? Krishna: This life and several lives are the fruits of one's Karma. Dharma and duties also are dependent on Karma. Hence Karma is important.</TEXT>

This usually consists of couple of day, with God traveling around the city in various Vahanas like Hanumana, Garuda the Ratha or the Chariot. Also in Narayana and Balaji Venkataramana ( Another form of Lord Vishnu) Lord Garuda is worshipped.</TEXT>

First the first few years after I left regular tarining, I used to help out my Sensei in teaching new kids. But now it has been a really long gap and my physical fitness is at its lowest. Also to stay motivated itself is a challenge. I do remember few Katas and exercises. Would like suggestions, tips, do's and don'ts which will help to get back in the dojo.

    <TEXT>An excerpt from the article. Kurt's Rule no 3. Keep it simple. To drive home the point, Kurt shows us how Shakespeare and James Joyce filled this maxim.  gt; "Remember that two great masters of language, William Shakespeare and James Joyce, wrote sentences which were almost childlike when their subjects were most profound.  #8216;To be or not to be? #8217; asks Shakespeare #8217;s Hamlet. The longest word is three letters long. Joyce, when he was frisky, could put together a sentence as intricate and as glittering as a necklace for Cleopatra, but my favorite sentence in his short story  #8216;Eveline #8217; is just this one:  #8216;She was tired. #8217; At that point in the story, no other words could break the heart of a reader as those three words do."</TEXT>

People are more bothered by scandals and deaths and life in general of celebrities, movie stars and sports stars because the latter are a part of people's everyday conversations. General public in a way are involved in the life of the sports stars and movie stars. They are a part of our life. People are like watching them from the fourth wall. Contrast this with the life of scientists or farmers. They do not feature in our conversation that much. However the paradox is our lives will be more affected by the work of scientist or a policy maker or a business owner than celebrities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a good idea. Thank you  gt;I'm a heavy plotter and, before I began a draft, I have a master outline that lists and then breaks down every scene in the book into beats. This means that my outlines, so far, have been about 20% the length of the final manuscript. I think I do this because, before writing, I was a film and music video director. In film, we tend to plan everything out in advance of shooting because being on set and shooting is so expensive. I also find that a thorough outline helps me avoid what I think is the most common pitfall that prevents newer writers from completing a draft.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, Swastika for Hindus is like Cross for Christians or the Creasant for Muslims. The three major religions symbols of Hindus are Swastika, Om and the Shankh - Conch shell. And these symbols were often carried over by other religions that originated in India or were influenced by Indian culture - The Buddhists, Sikhs, Taoists etc. These symbols are predate Christianity (0 BCE) by hundreds of years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The PHD Movie is a live-action adaptation of the popular online webcomic #160;"Piled Higher and Deper (PHD)" #160;about life (or the lack thereof) in Academia. With humor and heart, the film follows the plight of two graduate students ("The Nameless Graduate Student", played by Raj Katti, and Cecilia, played by Alexandra Lockwood) as they try to find meaning and balance in the annals of Academia. Along the way, appearances are made by other well known PHD Comics characters. Look for Mike Slackenerny, Tajel and of course Professor Smith. Eventually, they learn that getting a Ph.D. is as much about finding truth in research as it is about finding truth in yourself. Running time: 1 hour 5 minutes Rating: This film has not been officially rated (but if it was, it would probably be PG) For an extended synopsis, #160;click here</TEXT>

This is one of those things where like, someone talks about going back in time to kill baby Hitler or whatever, right? Except you killed seventeen baby Hitlers. Or something like that, anyway. Well, I guess these kids wouldn't end up killing as many people as Hitler, and some of them, I guess, don't even end up directly killing people, but that..."

    <TITLE>How was the life of a Ankachekavar or Chekavar in 16th century Kerala (India)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-20 13:43:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Wikipedia has only limited information that Ankachekavars (warriors) used to fight duels for their kings. It says: "When a dispute arose between two local rulers, each side would engage warriors to fight for them in organised single combat at a fixed place and time. Each local ruler was represented by one Ankachekavar. The ankam were usually fought to the death, and the ruler represented by the surviving Ankachekavar was considered the winner." This is the article link : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankam?wprov=sfla1 Has anyone studied this subject and can throw more light on the same?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kingkiller chronicles or His dark materials or Earthsea - Book recommendation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-27 12:55:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Actually I am looking for my a fantasy book to read. My background in fantasy reading: I have read The Harry Potter series - Immensely enjoyed the series. The Lord of the Rings  amp; Hobbit  amp; The Children of Hurin - Respect it but would not want my next book to be a saga or epic Eragon/ The Inheritance Trilogy : - Was good and enjoyable. The Bartimaeus Trilogy - Great characters, dialogues and banter. The Good Omens - Excellent work Percy Jackson- Was decent, good. You get the idea. I am not a complete newbie but I haven't read far too many books in the genre. I jave shortlisted the following books for my next read- 1. The Kingkiller Chronicles 2. His Dark Materials 3. Earthsea series by Ursula Le Guin 4. Edit: Guards, guards by Terry Pratchett (Edited after going through the Fantasy Flowchart). (You can add your suggestions to the list.) I have omitted the ASOIOF/GOT because I don't like too much violence or Sexual crimes. Can you help a lost reader find the right book? Thank you. tl;dr: Need to select a book to read from The Kingkiller Chronicles, His Dark Materials, Earthsea or any other suggestions from you. Edit: Added **Guards, Guards by Terry Pratchett** after going through the Fantasy Flowchart. https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/flowcharts/introtofantasy</TEXT>
