    <TITLE>Is there a sweet spot (age/mileage) for buying a used WRX?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-19 14:58:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am looking at taking the leap and finally getting a WRX. The issue I have is that I have no idea what age range I should be looking at to avoid the rapid depreciation of a brand new one. I also don #8217;t want it to have a ton of miles maybe sub 50k. I know I could just take the estimated average miles per year to basically get a range of model years to consider but I thought I would reach out and ask the community for any tips. Any chance I could get a little insight for those who have been down this road?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate the feedback. Is there a generally accepted  #8220;best #8221; or  #8220;worst #8221; year in the last 7 or 8 years for the WRX? Sorry if this is common knowledge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So other than having pristine maintenance records or other hard data indicating that it was cared for what are some things to look for that indicate abuse or neglect? Is it a common practice to have a vehicle like this inspected by a Subaru dealership to validate that it is a quality vehicle? What are some key things to be on the lookout for during a test drive? Sorry if these questions are annoying but I have wanted a WRX for such a long time and I know that, because they are quick and fun, some people tend to give them a hot supper. Last thing I would want is a money pit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For both multiplication (x) and division ( #8226;| #8226; looking thing I can #8217;t figure out how to type on my phone) it seems that each of them is based off the more basic operations symbol + and  #8211; respectively. Meaning that visually the x is just the + turned on its side and the  #8220;division #8221; symbol is a  #8211; with a dot above and below (which also looks like a fraction where the dots represent the numerator and denominator. Which may help someone better understand that multiplying is just adding over and over and division is subtracting over and over until you get to zero. The x may also help elementary students understand how to understand the concept as you usually have a lesson where you treat the  #8220;x #8221; as the word  #8220;by #8221; and use blocks to make a 3x4 (3 by 4) rectangle to show how 3x4 makes 12.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>We broke up after 3 years but on good terms. Should I go for broke (literally) or toe the line as requested?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-11 08:58:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title says I recently broke up with my (36/m) GF (30/f). We have always been pretty solid. We are/were very close friends for the entire relationship. We moved in together quickly (3 months) and after that we moved into a fixer-upper (9 months later). For the last two years I have been remodeling the house while she decorated it and does the gardening and such. Not because of gender roles or anything. I just know nothing about enhancing an interior or planting a hosta. She doesn #8217;t have the experience with power tools or how to plumb a sink. Those two years killed us. We both broke our backs getting this house completed. We both have office jobs so it was a drain on the mind for the first 8 hours of the day and then 10 hours of physical (usually) house projects. Being that tired and staring down the barrel of what seemed an eternity of peeling back the layers of this house and always being faced with two steps back one step forward scenario. Anyway, whether it was depression from being in semi-winless battle with the house or just being frustrated at work, we drifted apart as friends and as partners. Last week she hit the end of the line and called it. Nobody did anything super wrong. Nobody cheated, lied, or anything of that sort. We still like each other as people but know that we each have our own work to do as individuals. This means that I am going to have to move out and I think that I can very barely squeak a down payment for a house out of my available funds. I really want to address the things that she has issues with like forgetting special dates and my really being present in the relationship. I admit that these are valid shortcomings and that I have been unfocused on our relationship. I have been doing my best to take these things to heart and work on them with a deliberate mindset. Now comes the question: I have enough to do the whole  #8220;grand gesture #8221; thing or to buy a house. There isn #8217;t a ton left over to do both. She has a bucket list and I think I can help her cross off quite a few of them in a single 3 day trip out west. Gonna be a couple grand to pull it off and even if I make all the plans she could very well still say no and I might be out all of it assuming non-refundable travel or lodging. A huge part of me wants to make up the attention and mindfulness that she deserves all along but did not get due to my faulty prioritization. I #8217;m just not sure that I should follow that feeling as she may see it as too late and I may be trying to un-ring a bell. So should I be safe for me or take a leap for us? I want to say take the leap but I #8217;m a little too far up my own ass these days to get an accurate reading on the life compass. TL;DR - GF initiated breakup. We are on good terms and I don #8217;t want to split up. Should I spend a bunch on a romantic gesture or worry about me and save for a house?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t mean this to come off as defensive but I certainly can pull my weight financially. I used to be a bit of a mooch years before she was in the picture and I have a decent amount of guilt surrounding the fact that I used my friends and family to float me while I did nothing. Never again. You do make good points but I #8217;m having a hard time not seeing us getting back together as the number one thing on the  #8220;you [I] should be a priority #8221; list. Maybe I #8217;m just not accepting of the thought of us as separated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it possible to modify my 401k contribution in order minimize taxes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-13 17:35:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is there a way to figure out what effect my contribution amount has on my income taxes? I would assume that if I can put more pre-tax dollars into 401k I would have less to tax but I #8217;m not sure if this is a smart idea or if I should find some other way to get the most out of a relatively small (1-2% max) annual raise. Is there any advice on managing this on an annual basis to decide how to set my contributions? With all of the rules for how this money is considered by the tax man I feel like I would probably either shoot myself in the foot or the changes would not have any measurable impact.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to figure out value of home improvements. I could really use some help.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-17 14:52:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I recently split from my SO and among a ton of other things that need to be split back up is the house. To be clear it is in her name and my name is not on it as far as the mortgage/contract etc. The issue is that we have spent a ton of money on home improvements/renovation. I have done all of the work on the house so I have a lot of time and money invested in the place. I was considering contacting a lawyer to see what my options would be for recouping some of this cost as it was always a 50/50 thing going in so I feel I have a case for getting something on the way out. Problem is that I am not wanting to do that as she has a ton of college debt as well as a lot of other expenses that are already a stress on her financially. It isn #8217;t a vindictive or angry split up and I just can #8217;t see making that move and causing additional difficulty to someone I consider to be one of my best friends. My alternative is to draft something up that, at the time the house is sold or used in any way other than a primary residence, I would then get some amount or percentage of the profit of that sale. I do not know how to figure out what this number should be. I am thinking 50% of the original materials/appliances cost plus some percentage of the increase in value that the house now has due to the improvements. Is there a way to figure out what the appreciation of the house with the improvements other than having it appraised? Is it common practice to assume a continued appreciation of the improvements? What I mean by this is if the house was bought at 80k and the renovations pushed it to 100k does that 20k increase grow at the same rate as the market value of the house year over year forever or would it decrease over time? Also should I ask for this percentage after all closing costs and everything is final or does it make more sense to ask for it first and then split those costs? This is kind of a mess and I don #8217;t want to under or over estimate the amount that I feel I should get from this and I #8217;m really struggling to work it all out. Any help would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I move a percentage of my 401k contribution to Employee Stock Purchase Program?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-21 20:06:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>My employer offers a stock purchase program where they will contribute an additional 15% buying power to post tax money from my check with which to buy their stock. Should I be diverting a portion of the percentage of pre-tax dollars I currently contribute to my 401k? Off the top of my head I would say that the stock purchase has a built in return of 15% right off the bat which seems good. It also allows me to be able to have a chunk of money off to the side that isn #8217;t locked down by age restrictions and such. Does anyone know how I would go about systematically putting these two option side by side and running say $100 through all of the different taxation points and standard return percentages for retirement funds? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is super helpful. Thank you very much. Couple more questions.... sorry.... During appraisal would I theoretically want the value to go up or down? Will my city reassess the taxable value? Will this impact my credit score? I know you said soft pull but I am more wondering how they would view one loan being paid and another being created. I know there will be a small dip in my account age but is there anything else? Should I be pursuing 15 or 20 year fixed? How would I figure out the comparison to 30 year? Will I be able to borrow the full amount of the appraisal? If there is an increase should I take it and stash the money given the long term  #8220;low #8221; interest rate?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it #8217;s like 3 or 4 tents and some misc items like bikes and such. It is in the woods around the cemetery behind my house. I mean they aren #8217;t hurting anything or whatever. I haven #8217;t heard them getting carried away at night or making noise at all. It isn #8217;t a half bad spot to be fair. I #8217;m also a softie when it comes to people just trying to get by.

    <TEXT>Should I consider trying to set up a trail cam during the day when they probably clear out to either take advantage of social welfare programs or try and get money? The reason I ask is that there are several makeshift forts in the woods back there and in previous spots I found a pile of needles. This is not the case here I have no evidence of anything like that to my knowledge. I #8217;m just trying to not be a Karen/Ken whatever but at the same time I have a lot to lose if someone does become desperate/violent even if only because of the convenience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay. So I #8217;m wanting to pull the trigger on a tent setup for my basement. I #8217;m in MI. Winter is cold basement is prob cold and as we move to winter it will become less and less humid. I have looked around and I think I #8217;m going to go with the cloudline T6 for exhaust but this is where I become stuck and confused. I am going to have a room exhausting warm/humid air and pulling in cooler/dryer air but from what I understand there needs to be a constant exchange of air (once a minute or something?) so how in the world can I manage the temp and humidity of the entire volume of air if it is all exchanged every minute? Like I can stick a heater and a humidifier in there but again it seems like there is no possible way for either of those to keep up with controlling an air mass that is new every minute. It just seems like, assuming temp and humidity are being regulated, the only reason for circulation is replenishment of CO2 so should I simply try and find a way to add CO2 and just use airflow controls for when temp and humidity reach set limits? Sorry if this is rambling or asked and answered. I #8217;m just kinda losing my mind trying to  #8220;put it all together #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s all good but I guess what I #8217;m wondering is how I can possibly manage the air temp and humidity fast enough to comply with the fact that I have to exchange the air so often. So once a minute I am supposed to completely replace a tent full of air at 80 degrees with air that is 65 degrees without having the temp fall outside the ideal range. I don #8217;t understand how this works. Surely every grow tent is t in a grow tent that manages a air supply. I get all of the things you can do to add or remove heat or humidity but I don #8217;t understand how the amendments I am doing to the air in the tent aren #8217;t essentially just sucked out of the exhaust vent. It just seems like an enormous amount of work/money/energy goes into making the environment to a certain spec but the air exchange requirements force me to constantly expel adjusted air for the sake of CO2.</TEXT>

Anyway here is my situation and I guess I #8217;m just looking for what the outcome may be, what I can do, how could it have gone better or worse? I #8217;m new and this was a shot in the dark. I have 25 orders for $35c 11/20 for AIMT. Apparently they have been acquired by nestle or something and I got a message from RH that the option is locked from further action. Can someone shed some light on this? Are my options just garbage now due to a corporate restructuring? Did I hit some random jackpot? Seriously anything would help. Thanks guys/gals.</TEXT>

NIO $30c 10/23 1ea NIO $32c 10/30 1ea NIO $25c 10/30 2ea NIO $28c 11/13 1ea This is what spawned the question because I don #8217;t know if spreading them like this makes sense or if it makes sense to pile everything into the call with the best $premium/%point needed. NIO just got and upgraded evaluation which says that fair value is around $44 so, while I #8217;m an idiot and not one to give advice, there may be room to scoop up some gains.</TEXT>

I #8217;m not the greatest with the story problem way that it is usually explained. Is there some program or something that does analysis and flags when things move past certain thresholds as far as the Greeks and whatnot? When you say time decay is that basically the idea of getting painted into a corner? Meaning as the option approaches expiry there is less possibility of movement? Is there a threshold of no return for the Greeks like a delta of  gt;X means that it is time to sell to close? Something to tell me when it #8217;s slowing down, stalling, or going the wrong way independent of the intrinsic properties of the contract. Let say I #8217;m up 100% on day one. Things are great. It #8217;s just bitchin #8217;. Now let #8217;s say I peek at the Greeks and write them down. Does their day over day change flag me to get out? Is there something that tells me it hasn #8217;t peaked? I know there are a bunch of factors. I get that. I #8217;m just looking for what the 80/20 rule book says to do MOST of the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m tracking what you are saying. So assuming the I believe that this stock will surpass the highest call amount at each expiry date and also assuming that it will continuously trend up through my latest expiry, did I do this right? I also wanted to spread the risk/return a little which is why I grabbed some higher calls throughout.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess I don #8217;t know what I don #8217;t know. Just frustrating because I had been killing it with VSLR calls over the last couple months. This one was no different. I think it was up like $600. Market closed. Next day it was just gone. 24 hours later I get a message about corporate action the option locks and then turns into $4 total equity. It just sucks that I was right. I believed the company was going to do great and it did great enough to be bought. My prize for being right is $4 that I can #8217;t even sell. Seems cool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see where you are coming from but it seems a bit semantic. Sure I #8217;m just whiny because it went against me. If this went the other way and I made huge gains I surely would be 100% okay with the system. At the end of the day though I don #8217;t know anyone who would buy a call thinking it would go down or a put thinking it would moon. So I guess that #8217;s where I am coming from when I say that I was showing confidence in the company. But that #8217;s just like, my opinion, man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I am really green and not in the good way. I just didn #8217;t imagine a scenario where something that appears to be so highly regulated would allow this. Again no reason for me to think that. I just did. Not that expensive of a lesson in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for being a simple Simon about all of this but can you please explain why buying in the money would be bad? Assuming of course that it is at $20 and I buy a call for $22.5 in a couple weeks and I also buy a call for $10 expiring the same time. Lets assume that the premium was $1 for the $30c and $5 for the $10c Let #8217;s assume two scenarios: The stock hits the $30 break even exactly. The stock goes up to $40. What happens in each and while I understand if you aren #8217;t in the money at expiry it is worthless but why would it work if you were too far in the money?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the book recommendation. I will absolutely check that out. I figured that was basically going to be the answer that I would get. I really wish that someone would create a business that is essentially the H amp;R Block of stocks/options. Someone pay to say, walk me through the basics of trading. I have seen a lot of reports in the surge in amateur trading (me) which is said to be having an impact on the market. Being able to move through a live option with someone who understands it at a semi-pro level would be really useful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I needed to hear this PSA. For real. I #8217;m not unlike millions of others jumping in from boredom or fantasy. Getting an RH account and just going off the rails. Buying $400 dollars worth of bullshit super short calls over the course of a week and then losing it all helped me understand that I needed to change my way of thinking. Then I fucked up on WBA calls same way. Working on just clearing the board on anything that is a stupid  lt;$100 contract. I think I have been conditioned to see any form of  #8220;gambling #8221; as an instant gratification situation and the idea of placing a  #8220;bet #8221; 3-6-12 months in the future is a just a very counter intuitive feeling. I want to win it all right now so I can take a break forever. Why is that so difficult?</TEXT>
