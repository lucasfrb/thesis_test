    <TEXT>Thanks to websites like reddit, thousands of people who had no idea about CISPA were informed and were able to do something, sign petitions, spread the word to other people who were uninformed about such a terrible thing, and try to make a change. I don't understand why you or anyone would be opposed to the spread of information that could affect so many of us, even if it does give someone karma. There are bigger things to worry about then people getting upvotes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had the same situation when I was buying my monitors, I was told by many engineers that if I was looking to produce more than engineer that the KRK 8's would do the job, but that wasn't my objective. I got the Yamaha's HS8's and can honestly tell you that for me, it was the better purchase. My mixes tend to sound cleaner due to a smaller amount of lower frequencies that the yamaha's have compared to the KRK's. OF COURSE if you get your ear used to your speakers your mixes can be clean depending on your ability. IMO Yamaha's  gt; KRK's Also, your first project posted is very unique keep up the good work</TEXT>

Faber is also a killer in the sense that the time it took for him to finish after the eye poke had occurred was very quick. You can't stop a guy who has a choke in if you didn't initially catch the eye poke to begin with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As times change and more information gets brought out of the darkness more states will jump on board the legalization of a plant that has been proven to be extremely beneficial socially, medically, and economically. It does make me uncomfortably sad to know that so many of these "legislators" are only looking out for their own pockets rather than the potential for growth as a society. Change is needed, not a political campaign indicating the hope for change, real change.</TEXT>

I personalize the submission so that they know I'm not just sending them a mass email. But it's still hasn't been the most successful campaign. I know the first key to getting featured is to make good music, but what are some tips or any advice you guys could help me out with on how to improve your chances of being featured on music blogs?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fantasy Picks for tonight</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-02-22 18:21:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just finished making my fantasy team for MMA Draft Kings, but I'm interested to know how r/mma thinks the fights will be going down tonight. My picks: Mir - (hoping for a Mir motivated enough to win this fight and possibly retire on a high note. Plus I think that both are fading since the TRT exemptions and I believe that Mir can be the first to submit Bigfoot) Johnson - (I think his 1, 2 combination will eventually expose Barboza, although I don't really agree that Barboza has as weak of a chin as everyone makes it out to be) Alvey - (Alvey has only 1 lose due to submissions and the rest are decisions. I know Mutante is a physical monster and very skilled but I think Alvey can pull off the upset) Alcantara - (I don't think Saenz is getting the recognition he deserves and I believe that it's because he's never faced an opponent on Alcantara's level before. I'm hoping for a quick finish from Iuri, he switched his camp to Jackson's which can mean two things; He's going to come out in the first dominant as he can be and finish; or he's going to have a low point scoring bout decision like his fight with Reis. I'll take the chance and go for the possible 1st round finish.) Strickland - (My final pick is Strickland, he's a finishing machine I think his grappling and pressure will be too much for the Argentine. The only thing that throws me off is the fact that it's Strickland's first fight at 170 and for a fighter who's game plan consists of constant pressure it's going to be interesting to see if he can push those limits at his new weight class.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Buying my first synthesizer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-07 19:01:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I finally am going to buy my first real synth. I've ben using plug in's for a years now and have been borrowing a couple of synths from a friend but after working my ass off and saving money I finally have the option of buying a synth. I produce music with similar sounds to Chet Faker, Glass Animals and Jungle. I wanted to ask the people who know more about synthesizers than I do, what should I buy as my first synth for that style of music? I've been studying the Juno - 60, the Yamaha DX-7, and Dave Smith's Pro 2. Any tips or advice I'd really appreciate. Thank you! Edit: thank you everyone for the tips, really have some more studying and listening to do!</TEXT>

Cariaso is a good striker without a doubt but I just don't see how he can stop the takedown against Henry. The best way to win in MMA fantasy is to pick the mismatches, look at that and ask yourself who do you honestly believe will KO/sub somebody in the earlier round of the fight</TEXT>

He takes your belt, you kick his ass on July 11th. Conor said it himself after his Brimage fight you can't get emotional in the octagon, and I think Aldo is getting more emotional as time passes.

    <TEXT>This deal has all the makings to be a huge payday for the UFC higher ups while really messing with fighters sponsor pay. I think MMA fighters need a fighters union and I think it needs to happen ASAP. A union that will really step up and stand up for the injustices that go on behind the scenes. I love MMA there's no other sport that comes close to it in my opinion but the UFC is a company not the actual sport and something has to be there to challenge it when they start messing with the income of their athletes. Without the fighters there is no UFC</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with the Stipe picks, I think over a 5 round fight with great footwork and some variety of stand up and takedowns he can beat the Super Saiyan Hunt..... of course Hunt has dynamite in those lunch boxes he calls hands so you can never truly count him out. BUT I'm not so sure Tavares is going to dominate Whittaker like everyone thinks. Whittaker looked great at 185 in his last fight; I think he's a SOLID underdog pick in this card</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sick track! Really liked the overall composition and the mix sounds great as well as it's mastered really well. The only feedback I would give is the opening chords are really nice and I feel that maybe giving it a little more body would really fill them up. I know you probably had to leave a decent amount of low end for the bass since it's very powerful but those chords are really nice to listen to and maybe some more body would really bring them out even more. Just my opinion though. Great track man</TEXT>

Got really excited that they were finally coming back to South Florida and I hear it's Lyoto and Yoel so I get pretty excited and then the card around the main event turns out to be extremely bland, and the prices are ridiculously expensive for the card they're offering. Still want to go but just don't think it's worth spending $150 for nosebleeds for that card</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Companies pay news outlets for publicity, this isn't really anything new. Musicians, athletes, radio shows, and so many public figures and companies pay for publicity. Publicity campaigns exist for reasons. Not defending Dana for acting like an idiot lately, because he deserves to be called out for his recent actions. It just shouldn't be shocking to people to realize that companies pay for news publicity all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since Shitle Tots in the UFC aren't necessarily earned anymore but more of a marketing scenario (Bethe, Cain vs. Werdum 2, Gustafsson, Holm). I would love it if the UFC could finally sign Fedor, match him up against Cro Cop and the winner of that fight gets the immediate title shot. I don't think that either could beat Werdum now (have to wait and see how The Last Emperor is looking) but would still love to see them in one last title shot, especially for the UFC.</TEXT>

She has said before in recent interviews that she would like to get more experience under her belt. I'm sure that she was pressured into taking the title shot sooner than she wanted to but I'm also sure that the pre$$ure put upon her to accept the fight has some nice benefits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, I do think he would get beat by Werdum, but if Cro Cop and Fedor fight one last time and it takes place in the UFC, I wouldn't mind seeing the winner get his last title shot. I know it would make no sense, but I'm still buying that PPV if it happens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hadn't thought of this match up and it sounds like it would be a GREAT fight, but I think Faber could go out there and use his grappling and GnP to win a decision or get a submission finish. I would love to see Almeida fight Johnny Eduardo and if he wins that fight then I would love to see him take a big jump up in competition and fight Faber, or maybe even give him Bryan Tate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Psoriasis is not contagious, I've been doing BJJ for about 7 years and you see all types of skin things over the years. But this isn't really one that at least personally would bother me. I think the best way is to be straight up about it let them know what it is, educate them and then train. I would recommend rocking some Aoki spats and a long sleeve rash guard for No- Gi, and with Gi... well you're wearing a Gi so I think you should be fine. Jiu jitsu changed my life in so many positive ways from self confidence, to understanding that even if you're caught in a bad situation or position in Bjj or life that you're always just one move away from completely reversing the situation and I feel that thankfully I've been able to apply that to my life since I started training. Sorry for the mini essay but if you're thinking about it, than just do it. Make Shia proud</TEXT>

I don't have Psoriasis but I've seen friends and training partners that have it or have gotten it. Go to a BJJ class, pick a gym and try it out usually gyms will let you take the first class free or a week free. Try out SEVERAL gyms and once you've gone to a few join one. At my school trains a 74 year old man who does the MMA class as well as the BJJ class and every time I go to class seeing him is a reminder that you either man up and do something or you don't but it's your decision.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really like both Duane and TAM. I think both sides had something very special but it dissipated (except for TJ obviously). The whole drama has made both sides seem bitter and honestly at this point it's irrelevant. Hopefully this is the end of the beef between them.</TEXT>

I understand that the most important thing is to make good music but after that what do you guys from your previous experience believe is the best way to actually get your foot through the door with those outlets (Majestic Casual, The Sound You Need, etc.)? I always check their contact forms for submission directions, submission emails, but I'm looking for a way of contact to get them to at least listen. Thank you!</TEXT>

It's kind of shitty to see so many people who were posting facebook statuses before her fight talking about how big of an influence Rousey is for womenand in a split second turn on her and talk so much nasty shit. I definitely believe that Ronda needed to face something like this to bring her down from that imaginary cloud, and the perfect person to do it was Holly.

At one point in the second round he even looks at Fedor and signalizes a little "come on gesture" but it didn't seem like it was a taunt more of a lets go hit me now type of sign. Maybe I'm just looking too into it. The first round seemed legitimate to me but nothing after did.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Florida) JetBlue has caused us to miss our connecting international flights two consecutive days now and are not helping.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-04 17:58:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Myself and my colleague work for a production company, we were schedule to fly to Iceland for two days. We were schedule to fly out of Fort Lauderdale Airport yesterday (4/3) to Boston and then jump on our connecting flight to Iceland from there. Turns out our flight to Boston was delayed for over an hour and a half causing us to have to miss our connecting flight. They rebooked our flight for today (4/4) to now fly to JFK and then Iceland. We had to stay an extra day in Miami and pay for lodging and accommodations which we were not reimbursed for by the airline since they said they do not provide that service in these instances quoting "that's the way we do business." As we made our way to the airport for our next day flight we were informed that they delayed the new flight to JFK by two hours causing us to arrive 3 mins before our connecting flight to Iceland. We have lost two days of filming and recording in Iceland. and our bags are currently in Boston. Jet Blue is trying to say weather issues were the cause even though we were told by the supervisor in Fort Lauderdale airport that the cause of the original delay was mechanical. What can we do? TL;DR - JetBlue delays caused us to miss two connecting international flights in a span of two days, and don't want to help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, in executing a hard double leg takedown. What you described doesn #8217;t indicate that it #8217;s a slam, since you can apply a hard double leg and in the process of finishing it apply weight through your shoulder in order to get the right angle to finish; doesn #8217;t make it a slam though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry but you #8217;re contradicting yourself. A takedown and a slam are two different things, so in order for you to get a takedown it can #8217;t be a slam. This is the case of a hard takedown, it wasn #8217;t stopped during the match and the referee didn #8217;t even address it. There are plenty of rule books which you can see the difference between a hard takedown and a slam. In a suplex you don #8217;t drive your shoulder into the opponent and it #8217;s still considered a slam. ALTHOUGH I can see why you're saying him driving his shoulder to finish the takedown would seem like a potential slam. But after rewatching it the competitor applying the double leg continued his takedown from start to finish. If he would've picked up the opponent held him and then dropped down into his shoulder then there would be a case of slamming.</TEXT>
