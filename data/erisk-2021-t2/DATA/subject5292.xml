    <TITLE>Help me save Spiderbro</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-24 13:09:16</DATE>
    <TEXT># TL;DR: Want to get rid of bugs, don't want to harm spiderbro. Help pls. This might be different from the other spiderbro threads, but I thought you are the perfect sub for advice. I'm from Germany, so maybe I didn't translate everything correctly. Feel free to correct my english, I'd like to improve it! Also I will try to add pictures to make things clearer.  #160; I never thought I would tolerate a spider inside our apartment but he is the best kind of spider. He lives in a narrow curtainboard in our small bathroom and only comes out after dark, never wanders around, spins only barely visible webs and eats lots of insects! We have a peace treaty and he has lived with us for years. Since I don't like any kind of wild insects inside, we have those taped on windowscreens installed in every room except for the bathroom, since it only has a single window. Also the window is placed right above the bathtub in which we also shower, so we need to open it a lot to let it dry. In the last two years we have got problems with this bug. I tried to google what it is and it seems to be a "Amerikanische Kiefernwanze" or "Western conifer seed bug" in english according to wikipedia. As if the asian Ladybugs weren't enough of an annoying invading species, we seem to have those american bugs here now too. The window doesn't close tight all the way, because it is an old house and the window has deformed a little because of the wetness I guess. So those bugs press in the slits from outside and as soon as we open the window they swarm in. Spiderbro is doing his best to make use of this situation and eats them, but the bugs are too many and crawl around the bathroom on all our stuff. I have enough. I declared war on the bugs. But spiderbro lives in the truce zone and I'm afraid if I spray the window with some pesticide, it will harm spiderbro. I wouldn't have thought that I could care for the well-being of an intruder spider, but here I am!  #160; **So I thought about solutions:** * **leave window closed** - No option sadly, since we need the window to dry and ventilate the small bathroom, so we don't get mold. * **stick on windowscreen** - Won't hold, since window wet all the time. Also would like to have the option to reach our window ledge on the outside so I can shoo the doves away, when they try to build a nest again. * **windowscreen with frame that you can clamp in the opening** - House is very old and the window opening not straight, so the bugs would still get past the frame. * **trap for the outside window ledge** - When I search for "Wanzenfalle" I only get results for bedbugs. General insect traps seem to work with attraction through light or food. According to google these bugs are breaking in because they are seeking warm shelter, so I don't know what kind of trap I could make that wouldn't light the house on fire. * **bug spray** - Might kill spiderbro. * **catch spiderbro, then spray, wait until I think it's save and let him lose again** - I have no idea how I could catch him, since he hides super fast, when the light is turned on. Also I don't want to hurt him and if I'm truthfull, I don't really want to touch him. * **more spiderbros** - I have no idea how to get another spiderbro (he just showed up) and I also don't know if my current one is a loner. Don't want him eaten by a bigger spider, since I am loyal to him by now. Also don't want baby spiders, that will eventually swarm in need of an own place. * **hunt the bugs mysel**f - I do that, but they are so many and I want to be able to shower in peace. * **ask people of reddit** - I hope you can advise me what to do!  #160; Pictures of bathroom situation: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0NzvlfP.jpg) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Ojcdx0N.jpg)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your response. I didn't even consider how old my spider is. Since I can't identify spiderbro, should I just catch any other spider outside? Every Fall we seem to have lots of these [these](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d amp;biw=1376 amp;bih=667 amp;tbm=isch amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTQ71tsVZ4-zCrm9K-3BsnVwk_rww%3A1572000434340 amp;sa=1 amp;ei=stKyXZK8FJG4gQaFiZCIAw amp;q=Kreuzspinne amp;oq=Kreuzspinne amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39l2j0l8.3475.5196..5308...0.0..0.82.782.11......0....1..gws-wiz-img.46G-Q3-z2R4 amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS3eb7nbflAhURXMAKHYUEBDEQ4dUDCAY amp;uact=5) around..

    <TEXT>[Orginial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiderbro/comments/dmg65q/help_me_save_spiderbro/) Today I found lots of little spiders in my bathroom. I guess spiderbro is a girl and used the large food recources to start a family! The spiders definitely outnumber the bugs now.. by a lot. On one hand I celebrate the impending downfall of the bugs but on the other I kinda worry, the babies will swarm our apartment. So should I leave the window open some more, so they can disperse outside or will they stay with Mom in that place and forever keep this bathroom bugfree?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-14 01:28:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pmhwyWU.jpg) Hello, I tried to identify this spider and the pictures and descriptions of Steatoda grossa come closest. While googling I found this on wikipedia and now I'm worried about those Baby Spiders crawling everywhere.  gt; The bite of S. grossa is known to be medically significant in humans, but minor, without any long-lasting effects. Symptoms of bites include blistering at the site of the bite, muscle spasms, pain, fever, sweating, and/or a general malaise lasting for several days. Latrodectus antivenom was shown to be effective in treating bites from Steatoda grossa after it was mistakenly administered to a S. grossa bite victim who was erroneously believed to have been bitten by the far more dangerous redback. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatoda_grossa) I know they aren't super dangerous but those symptoms don't sound nice and before I panic I thought I'd ask your advice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heart of Thorns is pretty hard compared to the rest of the game. Be patient with yourself, try to focus on one mob out of a group, see which hurt you the most and get rid of them first. If you can, stay close to NPCs or even better other players! The more masteries you unlock, the easier it is to get around. If you have the Path of Fire expansion too, mounts should help you navigate the jungle. The hero points are also pretty tough, so if you struggle and can't improve your build enough with some guides out there, check the LFG for help or ask in map chat! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of veteran players struggled with HoT, when it came out. I myself got eaten but tiny packs of pocket raptors. So if you just bought the game and jumped directly into the first expansion, then it's super expected that you have a hard time.  gt;Their one attack where a lava like color shoots fast across the ground I just dont see coming and it almost oneshots me That's the Mordrem Guard Sniper (the ones with the bow) and I usually take them out first, since they die pretty fast but as you described deal a ton of damage. So if you want to stay in HoT (and not move on to Core Tyria or Path of Fire Zones - those are much easier) you really should try to team up with someone. The community here is very helpfull, if you ask in map chat!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question regarding Crown Crate Mount</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-10 08:36:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, newbie here! On an eso fashion site I saw this Baandari Pedlar Camel. It says it comes out of "Baandari Pedlar Crown Crate  #8211; Apex" or can be bought for 400 Crown Gems. Now I don't see the crates in the shop, so I assume there is a rotation? If the Baandari crate returns, does the option to purchase the camel directly for crown gems also return? Also, if I get a different Baandari Pedlar Mount out of the chest, can I exchange that mount for crown gems? Because I'm only interested in the camel. So far I have only gotten some crates from level up rewards and only got potions, that I turned into 11 crown gems. Would you advise me to just buy the normal camel in the shop? I have no idea how much it might cost to get my wanted mount from the crate or get so much stuff to turn it into gems (if that buy option even returns). Some advice would be very much appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, that was very informative.  gt;Also, never buy crates from the store, those things are a scam. Do you think they are a scam, because it's so hard to get the thing you want?  gt;I just hoard gems from the free crates Is there another way to get free crates than the level up crates? I think I only got them on one character only, so I guess those are one time per account only.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are very helpful! That example you gave is eye opening. I won't buy any crates. Now that you mention it, I actually got a crate from the daily login! Will make sure to always check the login rewards from now on. I didn't know that you could get guaranteed crates from twitch. I saw the post on reddit and thought it was one of those twitch chat spam raffles. Definetly gonna link my account now! And maybe one day I will have enough gems to upgrade to the nicer camel. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Question: Are there caps on stats? For example if I take stamina regeneration, I have a lot of sources for it. * Mundus stone * the armor trait that buffs the mundus affect * bufffood * armor sets * jewelery enchantments * medium armor * warden netch skill * warden passivs * werwolf elite * might get some from champions points soon Regardless of if makes sense to have to much reg, is it even stacking so much? If I try to google it, I get different answers and it seems like there have been changes in the past. Help is appreciated :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for this great response!  lt;3 I'm still kinda new and I wanted to try out a lot of stuff to learn from it and I definetly noticed that I have too much stamina reg by now. But I was still very curious if there are caps at all - so your answer helped me with that! This character that has the max-stamina-reg going is lvl 48 and my highest character so far. I want her to be my main open world character and be able to do some stuff solo eventually. I don't mind not doing things the optimal way, but I will still save the site recommendations to get some more guidance later on if needed or for my other group content character, where it will be totally needed! For now I really enjoy wearing sets that alter some stuff and not only buff my stats. Right now I use "Wilderqueen's Arch" and "Gryphon's Ferocity" because it helps with kiting. But in endgame it probably won't be usefull, since it seems stronger enemies are immun to the effect of the first set. So I might swap to the more boring "Hawk's Eye" when I reach 160CP.</TEXT>

They are pretty fast compared to those bigger phasmids. Regarding the Heteropteryx - I didn't want to scare you! They are very slow and you see their attacks coming. When she raises her hindleg, it's a trap! As long as you don't put your fingers inbetween the gap of one leg you shouldn't get stapled. They also can "hiss" with their wings. The males are much more chill. They like to fly if given the opportunity so they are rather a danger to themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What country are you from? I'm from Germany so I can't really say anything about the DHP since I've never heard of anyone using those. But regarding your voltage problem I asked my electrician husband! Seems like your lamp comes in 240V  amp; 110V. So you need the fitting one for your country. For example in Germany you would use the 240V and in USA you would use the 110V. For example if you use a 240V bulb in a house that can only give 110V your bulb wouldn't function properly. The other way around your bulb would die instantly or maybe even burst. Regardless of the voltage you should use a ceramic lamp fixture (hope that's the right word) because the plastic ones can melt eventually. The brand of your holder doesn't matter but the V it can take. So if you would use a 240V bulb you would need a fixture/holder made for 230V. If you need any help with the Watt or we missunderstood your questions feel free to reply!</TEXT>

You probably already do that but just in case not, my advise would be to keep him on wet and clean papertowels. No materials that could make the issue worse. If your gecko was well fed before and has a nomal or fat tail, I wouldn't worry too much about the not-eating part yet. But if you are giving the medicine with a syringe into his mouth you could try to add some mushed waxworms. But don't press to hard, you don't want to get that deeper than the mouth. Also regarding the syringe I would strongly advise to attach a [tube](https://www.dhresource.com/0x0/f2/albu/g2/M00/E8/DB/rBVaGlYZFKyAQYB8AACe1vtkxNg961.jpg) to the syringe so the gecko will bite on something softer than plastic.

    <TEXT>You're welcome! I think it's a good idea to go and see another vet. Maybe your gecko needs another antibiotic. Even if he just needs time, it's definetly a relaxing feeling to get an ok from the vet! Regarding the syringe, that could probably work. I just know that I will never try to feed my geckos with a plastic syringe without a soft tube at the end. I had to give my gecko medicine twice a day directly into the mouth and after a week or two, she was feeling better already and was probably fed up with the treatment. So when we went close to her face with the syringe she struck forward with her head and bit it super hard and at a very bad angle close to the sides of the mouth. And her whole teeth row jumped out and was hanging outside. We immediately drove to a reptile clinic and they had to sew her mouth shut and put in a tube to her stomach to feed her through and give meds. She didn't make the recovery and it really broke my heart. I'm really scared of syringes now. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mBDBnxw.jpg)</TEXT>

They are simple animals and don't even bond with their own kind. We try to make their homes as natural as possible, with the right temperatue and humidity and hides and all, so we shouldn't be taking them out for walks or snuggle time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't want to make you feel bad, but the gecko came back to you because you are a big heat source and he was probably cold from running around in the cold.

Leopardgeckos aren't dogs that will love you. They will either see you as a big predator or (the best you can hope for) source of food or a big heated rock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Do you not think that taking them out to explore is a form of enrichment? Personally I would rather build a bigger tank and switch stuff around for enrichment, so they can explore new environments but still have the correct parameters while doing so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh ok. If it is only for a few days the gecko stays in there it's maybe because he is not hungry yet and just really likes the hide. Leopardgeckos often prefer low hides, where they can feel extra secure. I'm curious, did you ever swap places of your hides? To see if it is the temperature/humidity he prefers there or just the hide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, there are definitely pesticides that are harmfull. I bought a spray years ago for something related to our guineapigs and luckily googled the spray in regards to geckos before using it. Then I called my reptile vet to be sure and he also told me to not ever use it - not even if they are in a different room.</TEXT>
