    <TEXT>I used to be in a kind of similar situation to yours. I spent all my time, even at school, making fake stories in my head. As I would walk through the halls I was narrating everything, and it caused me to push people away from me in my life. At night I would lay in bed for hours staring at my ceiling in the dark just making stories. But I don #8217;t do that as much anymore. Maybe it #8217;s just a thing people grow out of?

    <DATE>2020-04-30 22:37:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m going to tell you my story and I #8217;m really scared to do so but I need to. Two years ago I developed some mental issues (and I #8217;ve also had smaller shit like insomnia for a very long time) but two years ago it wasn #8217;t that bad. I was just sad. I had a friend that I would talk to every Tuesday about my family life and other shit. But we stopped doing that, and so I just bottled shit up. Six months ago I got my first job as a host in a restaurant and I fell into a hole of depression. It was really bad, I couldn #8217;t get out of my bed, I was constantly thinking about it to the point it would make me physically ill. It wasn #8217;t about the job, i don #8217;t even know what happened, something just...changed in me. Even thinking about it now makes me want to cry. Anyways, after the first three months, I started getting better, I made some kind of new friends and was feeling ok. But then quarantine came. The restaurant is closed, so that is off my mind. But my home life isn #8217;t the best and two weeks ago me and my mom got in a fight and I had so much emotional pain that I cut myself four times so that I could focus on the physical pain instead of the emotional. And it felt freeing, because I wasn #8217;t focused on my insides, and I hate myself a lot. But now I do it every night and I need it because sometimes the pain is too much. I just need life to go back to normal and I need the pain to go away. And I can #8217;t tell anyone but you guys because my mom has anxiety and she wouldn #8217;t be able to handle that burden at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m so sorry that you have to deal with such horrible feelings. I #8217;ve been there. It sucks, I #8217;m not even gonna lie. I know it #8217;s hard, but try finding things you love. Try finding hobbies, things that make life worth living. When I felt that way, I kept making lists of things that are keeping me on this earth, like people that need me. Your boyfriend needs you. And maybe try to tell your boyfriend this? How you feel as best you can? It #8217;s easier when people understand your situation, having people knowing what you need is really important. And I really think you are such a strong person. To feel this horrible emotions and to live in such cloudiness but yet still stay alive and still work is incredible and people don #8217;t realize how hard that is to do.

Also, to get a therapist, I #8217;d have to tell my parents what #8217;s going on, and they think that I #8217;m just some happy person with no worries. Even thinking about it stresses me out.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in a very similar situation. My mental health had just gotten to a bearable state until quarantine hit. I too have a small group of close friends and no love life. I have social anxiety and it #8217;s really hard for me to talk to anyone outside my friends. And I haven #8217;t been able to see my friends either because of corona. Anyways, something just shifted in my brain or something and I #8217;ve reached a new level of depression. I #8217;m not suicidal, but I hate myself a lot. I do bad things to cope with my emotional pain. I really hope the best for you and I hope your sister lifts your spirits. I also hope that you can find someone to love and to talk to. I believe that there #8217;s someone in the world for everyone, you just have to find them. Idk if you #8217;ll like these shows, but I really liked them so: Don #8217;t fuck with cats, in the tall grass, mindhunter, and bates motel. Btw, none of them have anything to do with romance :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depth and size don #8217;t matter at all. What matters is that your hurting. I want you to know that in this subreddit most of the pics are from people who go deep and that actually most people are shallow cutters, they just aren #8217;t in this subreddit because their scars are smaller, and that #8217;s ok! Take care of yourself, and don #8217;t feel that you have to go deeper to be valid</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My cuts look almost exactly like yours and are in the same area. I suggest wearing longer shorts and swim shorts and still putting bandaids on just in case and you can always say you slipped or something. Also, if they are completely healed over, I draw over mine and just say I got bored. I hope that helps and don #8217;t go deeper, trust me, it #8217;s not worth it.

    <TEXT>I use my very vivid imagination to cope with my depression. For example, I have an alternate family and an alternate school in my head that I sometimes imagine I #8217;m part of instead of my life. In my alternate family I have six siblings and I know all their personalities as well as I know my actually siblings personalities. I have all the details about everything and live in that sort of alternate universe. I also have a vlog channel that I voice over in my head as I do daily tasks and a radio show that I play in my head while cleaning my room or showering. It #8217;s weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I just got help and it was a terrible decision. Don #8217;t get me wrong, it can save some people #8217;s lives. But now everyone around me treats me like I #8217;m fragile and easily breakable like they have to treat me super nice or I #8217;m going to kms. And I *hate* talking about my problems but now I have to do that every week with my therapist. And I can #8217;t even tell her I wanna die bc I #8217;ll be in a mental hospital faster than I can blink.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Are you looking for a sleeve or just a regular tattoo?

I #8217;m sure it #8217;ll turn out great whatever you choose!</TEXT>
