    <TEXT>Hi! I #8217;m 27 and have recently decided to TTC with my husband (36). We #8217;ve been together 3 years and married for 1. I just stopped my HBC pills literally two days ago after 9 years on it and I get to see him again in just under 11 days (but who #8217;s counting?) because my work makes me travel... unfortunate during a pandemic, I know. I am originally from the SE US but not living there currently. I #8217;m a little paranoid about giving personal deets because I also work in a small field and a BFP will definitely have a major impact on my job - though luckily my husband has a very normal and steady job so that isn #8217;t a problem at least. I #8217;ve never TTC or been pregnant before. I had a sort of weird complex about it for a while because I #8217;m adopted and was the product of a one-night-stand, but ever since I found Mr. Right my feelings changed significantly. We had wanted kids from the beginning, but I just recently got settled into my work and a lot of the projects from here on out are going to be postponed because... yeah, pandemic. We #8217;re happy and stable and have a pretty roomy condo so we felt in our gut it was the right time to begin. I #8217;m cramping a lot right now so I #8217;m waiting on the post-BC spotting any day. Also feeling greasy-faced and having some mood swings. Ahh, to feel like I #8217;m a teenager again lmao. But I just started some prenatal vitamins and am both excited and nervous for the road ahead! Oh, and my username is a lame pun on a Nina Simone song because I was not feeling creative at the time I made this account.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maaaaan withdrawal bleeding after stopping HBC really really sucks. I was expecting some spotting, not this! I #8217;d been on the combo pill for 9 years and completely forgot what periods could be like. So much blood! The cramps! UGHHH</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m about 4 weeks off of HBC, and during the first week I had MASSIVE mood swings and was very weepy. After that it seemed to calm down significantly, but everyone is different. I really hope you start feeling more like yourself soon!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hubs and I hadn #8217;t seen each other for months (thanks, work and pandemic!) so we #8217;re basically acting like hormonal teenagers and are all over each other lol. I #8217;m temping but this is my first cycle post-HBC so I have honestly no clue what #8217;s going on with myself or what to expect.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Conceiving after continuous-use method of combo pill</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 12:37:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used the  #8220;question #8221; flair because I don #8217;t know how else to categorize this lol. Also, I haven #8217;t been able to find information about this particular question. Background first: I had been on the combo pill for 9 years. The first 7.5 years I took 0.8mg norethindrone/25mcg ethinyl estradiol (24/4), the last 1.5 years it #8217;s been 0.15 levonorgestrel/30mcg ethinyl estradiol (21/7), if that #8217;s relevant. When I temporarily moved to another country for work, the nurse prescribed me the latter of the two because a pill with the first formulation wasn #8217;t available. After about 6 months, I switched from an antidepressant and started taking Lamictal off-label instead for my depression/anxiety. At that point, the gynecological nurse I #8217;d been seeing told me to skip the sugar pills because of an interaction between the two drugs, which basically causes the Lamictal level to decrease in your bloodstream, so taking the placebo pills could cause a potentially dangerous spike of Lamictal. Side note: Lamictal has been shown to make HBC less effective, but I #8217;d never had even a pregnancy scare since starting it. I stopped taking HBC about 4ish weeks ago (bad memory, thanks ADHD) under careful direction from my doctor, who monitored me for the first few days to make sure I wasn #8217;t having the potential problems like toxicity that could be caused by the aforementioned interactions. Obviously, I #8217;m fine on that front. Anyway, there #8217;s the background, so onto the question: Does continuous-use HBC affect your chances of conceiving within a certain time frame, as compared to taking it in the  #8220;normal #8221; way? I know that HBC does not permanently affect your fertility in the long haul, but your hormones regulating themselves can take a while etc blah blah blah. I #8217;d imagine though that with continuous use the endometrium would be harder to build back up, and ovulation might take longer to resume since your body isn #8217;t used to any sort of withdrawal. But maybe the opposite is true? That your body is suddenly like  #8220;BAM those hormones are gone for real let #8217;s get a move on #8221;?? My body seems to have followed the expected course of stopping HBC, for the record. Like I said, I literally can #8217;t find anything about this, so advice/information/experience is much appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Echoing a lot of what u/goldbehold said - Your desire to have a child and care about their wellbeing shows your ability to rise to the challenge of motherhood when the time comes. You should probably consult a doctor or counselor about your concerns. Genetic health testing could also be helpful to see how hereditary your eczema is. That way, you don #8217;t have to ruminate on that specific issue and you have a better idea one way or another of the possibility of you passing it on to your child. Just spitballing here. Again, your care and concern shows you #8217;re a considerate person and capable of being there for your child regardless of their health. That #8217;s the most important aspect of being a good parent, imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From my understanding you start counting your cycle from when you first get your withdrawal  #8220;period #8221; after stopping, in which case I #8217;m on CD16. I #8217;ve also read that you can get pregnant after stopping HBC and before getting your actual period. I guess we #8217;ll see in about 2 weeks #8217; time whether it #8217;s regular or not yet!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kind of a weird one: Husband and I both have ADHD which means any kids will probably inherit that, since it #8217;s very hereditary. I #8217;m looking forward to being able to understand and support them and to get them an early diagnosis/treatment (if applicable) since my husband and I both got diagnosed as adults. School would have been much easier for me if I had the diagnosis, but being able to encourage and sympathize with my child about sharing the same condition will be really beneficial for all of us.</TEXT>

Anyway, I bought a two-pack of  #8220;early #8221; tests and got a BFN yesterday afternoon when I took one of them. I know you get better results in the morning but there #8217;s also the possibility I took it too early, and of course the likelihood that I #8217;m NOT pregnant. I #8217;m trying to hold off a few days before doing the second test, as AF is theoretically due tomorrow. Blahhhh.</TEXT>

I have a job that makes me have to travel away - sometimes abroad - for long periods at somewhat short notice and we #8217;d been wanting to try for a while but physically couldn #8217;t because of distance/covid travel issues. But now I #8217;m home with no projects to travel for that I know of, and as winter approaches there will be fewer. But come spring I #8217;ll be traveling again, assuming I #8217;m not on maternal leave. We #8217;re early in the process, as you can tell by my flair, but we #8217;re definitely going to have months where we won #8217;t be able to try at all because of distance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is gonna be one of those that will be hard to read for some folks and I know my luck is insane and I have not been the least bit diligent in tracking stuff... Cycle: 2 Age + Partner #8217;s age: I #8217;m 28, he #8217;s 36 Typical cycle length:  #175;\\\_( #12484;)\_/ #175; This is my second cycle off birth control. The first was 28 days and the second was like 42ish. Ovulation cycle day: Unknown, I was not temping or anything but judging by my tests it must have been around CD35? CD of positive test: CD52 Tracking methods/app used: Used FF/temping religiously last cycle and some for the beginning of this cycle. I thought I was out this round after getting two BFNs so I had stopped tracking... Relevant days of spermination/method: We were having sex every single day so I guess it was like throwing noodles at a wall and hoping something sticks. Health conditions: We both have ADHD and a few common/comorbid things like depression/anxiety, all being managed Supplements and medications (yours and/or your partner #8217;s): There are a LOT, nothing specifically fertility-related other than prenatal vitamins Birth control history: I was on the combo pill from 2011 until this past July. Lineporn: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/34YSfgL) - I was freaking out when I took the photo, wish I had gotten a better one Symptom spotting: I #8217;ve been much hungrier than usual, also sleeping poorly despite being very tired etc at the end of the day. My breasts have also been tender and, weirdly, my nose has been congested (which is a symptom sometimes!). Oh, and I #8217;ve been peeing a lot more. But the past 2-3 days in particular I #8217;ve been experiencing some weird, localized cramping that doesn #8217;t really hurt too much, it #8217;s kind of a pulling/tensing feeling and now that I #8217;ve gotten my BFP I #8217;m sort of relishing in that sensation. Other: Oh my god I can #8217;t believe I got pregnant my second cycle off birth control. I was adopted at birth so this is especially strange in the most wonderful way. I spent most of my life not knowing a single biological relative; this past February I connected with a half-sister but that #8217;s it. Anyway, like I said, I really thought I was out until the next cycle so when I tested last night as a  #8220;every two weeks #8221; thing I was totally bowled over when a second line appeared almost instantly. I legitimately almost fainted from shock. My husband and I are still getting over the shock but we are utterly thrilled and know we have a lot of work ahead of us. I feel kind of a vague guilt when I think about how many people here have been trying for months/years and I feel like I won the 2nd place lottery prize. You all deserve to be pregnant and have a baby too, so I #8217;m especially sending love to all of you who have had to be *very* patient in your journey. PS: holy shit I #8217;m gonna be a mom. There #8217;s gonna be a little human who needs me. PPS: holy shit my husband #8217;s gonna be a dad. He #8217;s gonna be a fucking awesome dad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m about 5 weeks pregnant, but I #8217;m not totally sure because I didn #8217;t track my cycle/temp this time and it was an unusually long cycle. Tested negative two Thursdays ago and then tested positive this most recent Thursday (then again on Sunday). My husband are from two different countries and are living in his country. Due to travel restrictions and health reasons, my parents can #8217;t come here, and there #8217;s currently a bad second wave of the pandemic. I will only be able to tell them  #8220;electronically #8221;. My husband and I told his parents and sisters last night, who were absolutely giddy to learn they were gonna be grandparents/aunts. They also are keeping things on the DL for the rest of the first trimester. I know I should tell my parents soon too, but my family situation is a little complicated for the time being. My mother, whom I love, can be extremely overbearing. Anytime I have some sort of project/stress/whatever going on she gets neurotic and hovers and asks me a billion questions. On top of that, her mother (that I don #8217;t have any contact with due to her treating me abusively) currently has aggressive cancer, and my mom and her siblings are with her in another city for a week while she gets surgery. My parents are still together, and while my dad is doing fine and is back home I don #8217;t want to tell just him. My mom is already very stressed and I don #8217;t want to bring out her neuroticism even further by telling her that her daughter is pregnant. Plus, for related and unrelated reasons, I #8217;M stressed and don #8217;t want to be consumed by it. Has anyone had to break the news at a bad time in a family member #8217;s life, and/or to an extremely overbearing family member? I definitely need some advice!</TEXT>
