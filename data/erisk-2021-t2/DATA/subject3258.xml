    <TITLE>TIFU by causing my sister to lose a job interview</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-11-20 21:33:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So earlier today I was at work and a coworker who is in her late 30's asked me for help regarding her son. She asked if there was any way she would be able to track her 12 year old son while she was at work. I began to show her how Find My iPhone works from my phone. Now my sister and I share an apple id. I was tracking my sister's phone and showing my coworker all the things you can do with the app. This is where the fuck up happens. There is an option that causes the phone to let out a loud ringing noise and without thinking I pressed the button. Nothing happened and that is when I realized that I was still tracking my sister's phone instead of mine. My sister happened to be in the middle of a job interview which she immediately lost. The employer didn't think it was professional to have a phone during an interview. Hers was on silent but the app bypassed that and still let out the ring. TL;DR: Phone set off a loud ring, sister lost an interview. ____________________________________________________________________ **Edit:** Here are the texts from her [Screencaps](http://imgur.com/a/HRg66) I feel like shit, and she couldnt silence the phone herself since it was the theft alarm ringing, it only silenced when I realized what I did and turned it off. She did really need a job, so I guess I am going to have to help her find a new one.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Question] Corrupted iCloud backup after jailbreak</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-06 00:27:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I purchased the new iPhone 6s. I backed up my old iPhone 6 one last time before turning it in for the new phone. When I try and restore from backup, it gets stuck on the apple logo screen. The progress bar on the bottom fills completely up and then it gets stuck on the restart portion. I thought it could be an issue with that one back up but I tried about 5 more previous backups with the iphone doing the same exact thing. My phone was previously jailbroken but that should not have caused the issues. I chatted with Apple about it with no fix but they are escalating it to the technical team. My questions are: is there a way to fix the corrupted back up and will the Apple Technical Team know that my phone was jailbroken when they look into the backups to see why they all corrupted? Thank you for your help!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for advice on new 40g stocking</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-09 19:07:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! I decided to take advantage of the $1 a gallon sale and picked up a 40g breeder. I have settled on stocking it with a black convict and a firemouth but I am looking for a good algae eater as well as some dither fish for the tank. I have read that swordtails and tetras make good community fish for cichlids but I was curious if anyone had any other recommendations? I would like some bright colored fish to really make the tank pop. As for the algae eater, I plan on keeping a few cherry shrimp, nerite snails, and possibly an american flagfish if I am able to locate one in a local fish store. The tank will be light to mid planted with hiding areas for the fish. I'm just interested in what other unique fish everyone here knows about that could work in the tank. Thank you!</TEXT>

I wanted one last centerpiece type fish that would work well with the current stocking. I was thinking the blue acara cichlid or a pearl gourami. Does anyone have any suggestions? The tank will be heavily planted as well with a carpet, moss, and a few taller plants. I am planning on limiting the taller plants so there is plenty of swimming room. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Emaciated Red Eye Tetra</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-18 05:03:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there, I am in need of some help/advice. About two days ago I got 3 red eye tetras to add to my school of existing 10. One of the fish appeared smaller than the rest but I assumed it was just younger. Two days later he is hiding under the driftwood and behind the sponge filter and appears extremely skinny. He stays towards the bottom and won't come up to the top to feed but due to the rest of the fish eating the food, I can't figure out a way to drop the food to him directly. The rest of the fish immediately swarm before it has a chance to sink. I've tried pellets, crushed flakes, whole flakes, brine shrimp, and blood worms. He did get ahold of a larger flake that got to him but after chewing it for a few seconds he spit it out. The tank is a 40 gallon breeder but I am moving them to a 65 in 3 days. The stocking is:  #8226;9 red eye tetra  #8226;19 neon tetra  #8226;5 glolight tetra (who school with the neons)  #8226;1 female opaline gourami (going into her own tank next week)  #8226;5 otos  #8226;a bunch of ghost shrimp and a few snails When I originally got the group he did have some torn fins. My ammonia is at less than .25, nitrates and nitrites are at 0, and I do have a harder PH of 8-8.2 but it is stable and I do not use any chemicals with it. I had the original 6 red eyes for a couple weeks and they are still doing great, this is the only one who concerns me. Does anyone have suggestions on how to feed him? Should I quarantine him in his own tank? I have a 3 gallon tank set up that he would be able to stay in but I won't have another free tank until later this week. I'm concerned there may be a parasite or he may be ill that I will need to treat. He greets me at the bottom of the tank at the glass so I was able to get some photos. Thank you for your help and let me know if there is any other information you may need. [Images](https://imgur.com/a/vQSaX)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Treating Sick Guppy? Possibly parasites</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-06 18:01:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I received a shipment of fish yesterday including 8 guppies. 3 of the 8 didn't look too good with one dying overnight but the others are in a 10 gallon quarantine. One of them I'm very concerned about. He spends his entire time laying on my floating plants breathing rather hard. I moved the plants out of curiosity and he sunk to the bottom before struggling to rapidly swim back into the plants. He is very emaciated so I am assuming it is parasites but he also came with very torn fins. I am treating the entire tank with general cure but is there any other medicine that i can treat them with? I do have some plants that I float in the tank and some dwarf rainbowfish that came in yesterday as well. I tried to take the best photos that I could but it is difficult with him hiding. None of the rainbows seem to be affected and they are all very active. Should I put him into his own quarantine tank? Any other medication that should be used? I'm new to sick fish so any help would be appreciated. Thank you! [Sick Guppy](https://imgur.com/a/nrMtS) Edit: I tried to spot feed him and he wasn't eating at all. Tried crushed flakes and brine shrimp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I am setting up a 5.5 gallon shrimp only tank. I am planning on it having the appearance of being blackwater but I will not be purposefully trying to achieve the actual ecosystem with the extremely low PH etc, I just want to achieve the natural, tinted, and overgrown look. I will have many floating plants, driftwood, and lots of indian almond leaves scattered in the sand. Does anyone have any suggestions for plants that will do well in a very tannin stained tank with lots of floaters? My PH is high at about 8-8.2 out of the tap but that may lower naturally with the amount of driftwood and leaves I will be including. I will/can have a strong light on this tank as well but it will be on the darker side due to all of the floaters. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, about a month ago I got 6 panda corys for my 29 gallon tank that were shipped to me. All of them appeared healthy except one was rather pale. It #8217;s been about a month and the color still hasn #8217;t returned but he is very active, eating, etc. He is constantly moving around the tank so he isnt lethargic and doesn #8217;t show any other symptoms other than the paleness. Tank is 29 gallons, sand, and fully cycled. Ammonia is .25 (it comes .25 out of the tap), nitrites are 0, and nitrates are 5. I feed them a variety of veggies, algae wafers, and frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, krill, and mysis shrimp. Temperature of the tank is 75 f. This is my first time keeping corys and I know that pandas tend to be sensitive from what I read. The color concerns me but otherwise he is super active. Any advice?

    <TEXT>Hello, I have a small 3 gallon planted shrimp tank that I will float new plants I have just recently received in until I am ready to plant them. Earlier today I noticed either an inch long dragonfly or damselfly larvae swimming around. Since the tank is small I was able to catch it and kill it.

What is the best way of killing the eggs that may possibly be there? I #8217;ve read so many conflicting comments on doing bleach dips on plants so I was looking for your suggestions.

    <TITLE>Tankmates for multis or similis?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-12 00:08:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>X-posting from aquariums because I figured you all would have some good recommendations. I set up a 20 long for a colony of either similis or multis (most likely the similis). Are there any tankmates for this tank size that would work well with the shelldwellers? I heard a calvus pair are a good option but I am not familiar with all of the different types. Any other recommendations? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>im setting up a 40 breeder as a plant growout/trimmings tank and i want to set up dividers so that carpeting plants as well as big rooted plants dont spread too far. ive done some research and most recommend using plexi glass and siliconing it to the tank to keep substrate separated but they are all geared to the divider not showing. id prefer for it to show so i can see the divisions and i don #8217;t necessarily want to silicone them in place since i will be rearranging the tank a lot to accommodate new plants. does anyone have any affordable recommendations for simple dividers? the cheapest plexi glass near me that would be large enough for a 40b is around $30. this isn #8217;t going to be a show tank so appearance doesn #8217;t really matter to me. thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-04-18 18:13:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>im not a disease expert one bit so i hope you all can help me treat my guy. yesterday i noticed that one of my bettas was rather lethargic and spent most of his time sleeping underneath a plant. he still came up for food when i tapped on the water like i trained all mine to do and he ate his food. today he was still lethargic and i noticed how pale he is. i took him out and am floating him in a tupperware container with some salt and an indian almond leaf in the tank to keep the temp consistent while i set up the 5g for him. to me it looks like his scales may be raising just a bit and he may be beginning to pinecone but he has no signs of bloat and he still has an appetite/is eating normally. he will come up to me when i tap the water but will swim/sink back down from what i think is lack of energy. here is my tank info:  #8226;split 20 long that is pretty moderately to heavily planted  #8226;tankmates are one other male betta on the other split half that is showing zero symptoms, a few amano shrimp, ghost shrimp, and nerite snails  #8226;81F temp  #8226;0,0, lt;5 nitrates for parameters  #8226;ive had him since september and he came from a breeder in thailand so im not sure how old he is  #8226;i feed them a varied frozen diet with the occasional pellet. they get a mix of frozen/thawed: bloodworms (once a week as a treat), mysis shrimp, brine shrimp with spirulina, beef heart, krill, carnivore frozen mix, and omega one super color pellets. bettas eat once a day and they eat something different each day so they have a varied diet. anyone have any idea what this could be (im praying not beginning signs of dropsy)? he has only started showing signs a day or two ago. ive taken some photos of him in the tupperware container, he is usually almost black with hints of red and blue. thank you!

    <TITLE>building a freshwater sump and refugium</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-24 08:40:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>i have a drilled and moderately planted 75g tank that i want to pretty heavily stock so i decided on making a sump for it since i have an extra 40g breeder tank laying around. after doing lots of research, im curious as to what y #8217;all setups are. most information on freshwater sumps involves a wet/dry system but i only want submerged media, no bioballs (or any other wet/dry system), and no fluidized system with the k2 tumbling media. i have a bunch of sponge filters in all of my tanks that i want to throw into the sump alongside lava rock and ceramic rings for the main filtration/biomedia. i also want about half of it to be a plant/invertebrate/fish refugium. has anyone set up anything similar to this that they can share? interested in how you have your chambers set up to maximize flow through the biomedia. i #8217;d appreciate any other help and advice for getting this set up as this will be my first sump. also any advice on insulating or minimizing noise since it is a display tank would be appreciated as well. thank you! EDIT: [here](https://imgur.com/a/YLilHwO) is a quick sketch for my gameplan, any recommendations or tips would be appreciated, thanks!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-09 06:36:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>i #8217;m giving away a male turquoise rainbow and a female halfmoon betta. [the betta](https://imgur.com/a/8eqTSkI) is a high quality halfmoon, unfortunately she gets stressed easily so she put on her stress stripes the moment i put her in the cup for photos. she has a blue body and large red fins, temperamentally she is more aggressive but may do fine in a larger tank with tankmates. the tupperware container distorted her a bit in the last photos. [the male turquoise rainbow](https://imgur.com/a/3KZZaFG) has some weird, unique coloring. he is half silver and half the standard turquoise coloring and i initially thought it was a female if it wasn #8217;t for the blue and yellow head he gets when he is sparring. i only want him going to someone who has rainbows already. both are very healthy and eating a mix of live and frozen foods. ive had the rainbow for about 6 months and the female for about a month. local pick up only, let me know if you have any questions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>need help with a fish with possible tb or just an injury</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-01 04:22:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>hello all, this is gonna be kinda long since i want to include all possible info. i know tb is super serious so i wanted advice from knowledgeable people here regarding this fish. a few months ago (maybe 5-6 or so) i was given a female betta for free since she had a small tumor on her side. i quarantined her for 3 months where she was medicated and the tumor never grew or gave her any issues. after a long quarantine i then added her to my sorority. the tank is a well planted 29 gallons with 5 female bettas, a school of ember tetras, corys, and loaches. it is over-filtered and parameters are 0, 0, 15 kept at 80F. a couple weeks ago a noticed the betta struggling to swim so i pulled her out and realized she had a chunk missing from her side kinda where the tumor used to be. i assumed it was an injury from either one of the bettas not accepting her (unlikely since they all got along well for a couple weeks but there is obviously a chance) or from a piece of driftwood/rock/etc in the tank since i have lots of rocks to create hides. i put her in a breeder net since i figured it could heal with some time and care. she received daily 30 min salt baths but i withheld on meds since she started healing rather quickly and the wound did not look infected. my concern is that it has been about 2 weeks and the wound is entirely healed over. her body, however, is bent in the area where the wound was. i #8217;ve researched tb in the past and i know the spine usually curves upwards into a humpback shape due to the organs bloating but it can go crooked sideways as well. the girl is eating readily and greets me but it is clear she struggles to swim and spends most of her time resting on her side. ive been watching her for days and can #8217;t figure out if this was just a wound that damaged her too badly and that is the reason her body is bent or if the tumor was actually slow growing tb and it finally ruptured causing the large lesion/wound. i #8217;ve attached as many photos as i could take of her to the post but it #8217;s difficult since she stays in one spot. you can see in the bend there is almost a ditch where the wound was as well. i can answer any questions about her or take any other photos that are needed, im just overly concerned and need to know if i need to break this tank down. no other fish in the tank shows any symptoms, has any lesions/wounds, and everyone is eating well. i appreciate any help with this!

    <DATE>2019-02-03 16:01:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>i purchased a group of neon dwarf rainbows and when i got them in, realized one is completely blind. they #8217;re currently in a 65g with all of my other rainbows but im concerned that he will be quickly outcompeted for food as rainbows are pretty aggressive eaters. i dont have the space for a new tank just for him so my options are to keep him in the big tank or move him to my 20l with my very peaceful betta so i can better (hopefully) spot feed him. he doesn #8217;t interact or shoal with any of the other rainbows and has been chilling near the plants the last couple of days. anyone dealt with a blind fish before?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-02-08 04:05:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a colony of Ameca Splendens for sale, I've had my fun with them and decided to move in a different direction. There are at least 10-15 fish as a combination of adults and juvies (difficult to count exactly) which is more than enough to start up a tank of them. These usually go $5-10 per piece but I just want them to go to a good home and to have another hobbyist experience them. I tried to take the best photos I could of them but they are very quick. Selling entire group for only $15 or willing to trade for plants or other fish (rainbows/plecos/nano fish). Due to weather and cost it is pickup only.  #8203; [PHOTOS](https://imgur.com/a/P8dAgZe)  #8203; Ameca Splendens are a critically endangered livebearing species from Mexico. Although they are livebearers, they have smaller spawns and only give birth every 2 months. They get about 2-3" so they should be in a larger, well planted tank that is established with algae. Food-wise, they eat a-lot of algae but are omnivores and should be fed a well rounded diet. They can be a little food-aggressive as well as nippy so do best in species tanks or with like-temperament fish. Mine do tend to school/shoal in my tank and they have interesting group behavior. Males have a silver-blue tint to them with a yellow tail while females have leopard spots. I kept mine on light colored sand but they look much better on dark colored substrate.  #8203; If you have any questions about them then feel free to ask and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-16 00:57:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a group of 5 Amazon puffers. Decided to go in a different direction and unfortunately am getting rid of these guys. Have them eating well on both frozen and pellet foods. Have had them for months and they are fully quarantined (internal parasite and tapeworm free). Asking $50 for the group which is a steal of a price for a fully treated/quarantined amazon puffer imo. Selling the group as a whole as they prefer being together.  #8203; They are doing great with my rainbows and gouramis but do need a larger planted tank with plenty of decor/hiding spots/stuff to check out to keep them busy and not glass surfing. One of the few true freshwater puffers that prefers being in a group as well. At this time it is pick up only but may be willing to ship if needed.  #8203; [photo](https://imgur.com/buhm0tt)  #8226; [more photos](https://imgur.com/a/XVGR9of)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-08 20:38:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a calico yuan bao goldfish for sale. im thinning out my goldfish stock and i unfortunately can #8217;t keep all of my yuan baos. it has good form and shape for its size so it should start developing a deeper body as it ages with good high protein food and clean water. many yuan baos have a longer thinner body when they should be short and stout as this one is. wish i could keep this guy but he looks very similar to another i have and i had to choose between the two. about 3 #8221; in length, 4 #8221; in total length with tail. [here are photos of him](https://imgur.com/a/VCDXETJ) i accidentally cracked my photo tank so the photos aren #8217;t as good quality as usual. i can take any other photos if requested. he is being kept in an indoor pond with 2 other goldfish, eating floating pellets, repashy, frozen foods, and duckweed. i am asking to get back what i got him for which was $50, pick up only since it is getting too cold to ship. please let me know if anyone has any questions. willing to trade for a nice oranda, ranchu, or nano fish for a new tank im setting up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>he #8217;s a mystery rescue but he most closely resembles a pea puffer. he seems to have reached almost max size as well. the only coloration difference is his spotting but i have seen dwarf puffers with similar (although not as bold) spotting. everything else matches a pea puffer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thank you! all of my tanks get a mix of frozen foods (blood worms, brine shrimp, cyclops, daphnia, mysis shrimp, plankton, krill, daphnia, fish eggs, and a whole bunch of other random stuff i try out), a large variety of pellets that range from bug based to plant based to carnivore and shrimp pellets, and a few different varieties of repashy. i basically try to make their food so varied that they cant possibly be getting deficiencies haha. all frozen food is soaked in garlic, spirulina powder, and vitachem before being fed. all shrimp eat this same mix, i dont specifically feed the shrimp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if cared for properly a single tail goldfish should reach 7-8 #8221; in the first year and 10 #8221; within 3 years. your guy looks to be stunted and at 9 years old he will probably not grow to his potential size. a 29g is far too small for a common goldfish but since your guy is stunted, you should be able to keep him in a 75g for life. i recommend upgrading as soon as possible to give him extra room to swim and to keep him healthy. edit: i regularly get feeders and grow them out to 8 #8221; for my friend #8217;s pond. they get there within a year if not sooner and i purposefully pick the unhealthy small guys to give them a chance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>goldfish are fine up to 74/75. fancies can be kept up to 76 during the summer. this looks like something that can be cleared up with clean water and salt. start with 1 tablespoon per 5 gallons and work up to 1 tablespoon per 2 gallons over a few days. if you dont see any difference within 2-3 weeks then i would try antibiotics. pimafix is tree oil and wont do anything so stop using it. ich meds also wont do anything against a bacterial infection and will just stress the fish out more. you #8217;re going to continue having bacterial infections until you get them into a properly sized tank though. until then i recommend 2x a week water changes of 20-30% and start growing some pothos to help with nitrates. goldfish are very sensitive to nitrates (opposed to common belief) and nitrate poisoning is one of most common issues i see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hillstream loaches appreciate groups but do perfectly fine solo. the issue is they prefer highly oxygenated water so you #8217;d need to have good flow for them. the best algae eater is a nerite snail imo but a group of pygmy corys, a hillstream loach, and some fish that can handle cooler water at 75/76(platys, mollys, ricefish) would make a great set up for a 20g long. add sand and river stones for the the corys and loach with a filter on one end to create flow and they should be happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>these breed in freshwater but only because they naturally breed after heavy rainfall when the water is diluted by rain. if you can measure your gh and kh you #8217;ll have a better idea of your water chemistry. if the gh is on the high end (above 12) then you #8217;ll have more luck with them in the tank. otherwise they tend to fall apart when kept in softer freshwater long term. these are usually confused for the freshwater version of the bumblebee goby which can be kept in freshwater its entire life and is a great algae eater. these guys are carnivores and have different behaviour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it depends on the fancies. ryukins and orandas for example get very large so they require more space (40 breeder minimum, if not larger + 20g per additional fish). smaller varieties like telescopes, ranchus, and pearlscales do follow the 30g + 10g per additional fish rule. most fantails are low quality ryukins so they won #8217;t typically get *as large* as a standard ryukin but i would still put them in the 40 breeder minimum category. a 55g is a good tank for two fantails but as they get large you may find that they need more space.</TEXT>

[here is a good resource for them](https://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/features/leaf-goblinfish-neovespicula-depressifrons/). they will eat smaller fish and shrimp but aren #8217;t necessarily aggressive. was it added pretty recently? if so it may have brought diseases in and that #8217;s what is infecting your fish.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[PSA] Rule Refresher and Updates</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 01:07:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all! As we continue to grow and get new users, us mods decided to update and refresh the rules. Hopefully this clarifies any questions that you may have. As always, the rules will be in the sidebar in condensed form and the wiki has them in full. If you have any questions post them in the comments and we will answer them. We will also be asking for some feedback at the end of this post in a survey so please share your opinions with us as we continue to make this subreddit the best that we can.  #8203; As a reminder, breaking the rules repeatedly will result in a ban. If you are flaired, we will remove your flair on the first offense since you are held to a higher standard.  #8203; Lastly, we do require photos for *all* items being sold or traded. This means that every item you are selling must be accompanied by a photo of it, the buyers needs to see what they are purchasing.  #8203; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1. **Follow the proper title format** **\[FS/FT/GA/LF\] - LOCATION - PRICE - title** 1. Use only LF, FS, FT, GA, PSA 2. Use \[\] around the tag, like this \[FS\] 3. For multiple tags use "/" so it looks like \[FS/FT\] 4. Your location must be included after your tag (state abbreviation must be included, just zip codes are not allowed) 5. Your price must be included after your location * For multiple items use a + after the lowest priced item. ie. \[FS\] - location - $5+ - Item1, Item2, etc * If you are are posting LF or FT a price is not required * For give aways use Free or $0  #8203; 2. **No Repetitive Posts** **One unique post per week.** * To clarify this means one "FS" post or one "LF" post, etc per week. This includes if you post a "FS" post on Monday and then a "FS/FT" post 4 days later. * If you need to post a second FS post due to emergent needs or the posts are different enough (freshwater plants in one post and saltwater equipment in the second for example) then you can message us via Modmail and we will either approve or deny the second post.  #8203; 3. **Nothing Illegal** We do not condone the distribution of illegal plants and animals, please check your local laws. This includes the sale of items that are harmful to aquatic creatures. You can find more information here: [Restricted Species list by state](https://www.monsterfishkeepers.com/forums/threads/restricted-species-lists.191893/) [USDA Noxious Weed list](https://plants.usda.gov/java/noxiousDriver)  #8203; 4. **No external sites** * We do not allow posts that redirect users to another website; please make a brand new post specifically for Reddit. This includes linking to your Ebay/private website/etc in the comments. * While we welcome giveaways (part of this sub is to allow people to pay it forward to other hobbyists), we would ask that you do not host giveaways, raffles, etc... that require someone to like or share a social media page.  #8203; 5. **Be Kind** Please be kind and courteous to others, any foul behavior will be handled accordingly.  #8203; 6. **Full Disclosure** The following **MUST** be included in your title and post: * What you are selling, looking for, trading, etc * If you are selling something, the price and method of payment * The method used to grow any aquatic plants. Your description should say emersed/submerged * If your item is pickup only, shipping only, or any combination * All businesses must apply for "Business" flair before they will be allowed to post. Any post made by a business that has not been granted "Business" flair will be removed * If you are a business you need to note if the items are imports or are grown/bred/made by you * Photos of each item being sold  #8203; 7. **Payments** * **Always** use PayPal for shipped items. We ask that you use this service because they offer some measure of protection to both parties. To that end, please DO NOT use the "friends and family" option through these services, as they **DO NOT** include buyer protection. If you are making a local pickup, feel free to work out whether cash or one of these other methods works best for all parties. * The chosen method of payment must be listed in your post, this includes GA and FT if you are collecting shipping costs. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  #8203; Those are the rules and all posts are required to follow them. Us mods have been thinking of adding one more change but we wanted feedback from the community since it is you who use this subreddit. We have found that people are putting the post contents in the comments instead of the post itself. It can be difficult/time consuming to find the actual post in the comments, especially with some of our larger sellers who get a large amount of comments. We are considering requiring the contents and details to be in the post itself instead of the comments to make it easier to find and read the information. We realize that most of the people who are posting it in the comments are doing so because they upload the post as a photo which doesn't allow a post body. You can bypass this by posting the photo(s) on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload?beta) and adding that as a link to the post. Reddit should still show the first image in the first Imgur link as a thumbnail for the post. This would also allow you to add all of the photos you may need for the post into one Imgur link if needed. Since it is *you* who use this sub, we wanted to ask for your feedback regarding this rule and if it is necessary. Would you find posts more convenient and easier to read through if the contents were in the post body rather than in the comments or does this not bother you? Please fill out this quick (anonymous) survey so we can get a better understanding for what the users here need. [SURVEY](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TVVKSQ2)  #8203; If you have any questions post them below. Thanks for being such a great community!  #8203; [Flair Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaSwap/comments/dn1qxp/new_flair_and_update_to_existing_rules/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x) [Latest Feedback Thread - 2/9/20](https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaSwap/comments/f1denz/latest_feedback_thread_2920/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you #8217;ll need to upgrade in about a month just as an fyi. they should get 12-14 #8221; so you #8217;ll need a 125 gallon+ to house all those and even then you #8217;ll need good filtration. to answer your questions: if your house is heated then you can leave the heater off, only turn off the filter to clean it and only clean it in tank water, and do water changes 2x a week of 30% (you can use tap water and condition it with seachem prime). algae is good especially for goldfish, they will nibble on it and it will lower the nitrates which is beneficial. even though it #8217;s ugly i would clear it off the front glass and let it grow everywhere else. lastly, feed them a veggie primary diet with brine shrimp and/or blood worms mixed in. i recommend 25% protein to 75% veggie personally for most people. you can find veggie pellets online and in many stores and you can also feed blanched veggies like carrots, zucchini, and lettuce. frozen brine shrimps and bloodworms do just fine, you cant hatch brine shrimp in the tank the goldfish are in but you can hatch them elsewhere and feed them live brine. i find frozen to be easier since goldies dont need live foods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sure, before i go into it i do want to clarify that the tank is overstocked and not feasible for *most* people. im currently house shopping and they will be upgraded as soon as i move. there isn #8217;t enough space for a bigger tank without reinforcing the house currently. tank: 90g light: 2x fluval 3.0, 1x ai prime freshwater im testing for another tank. *edit*: the fluvals are 36 #8221; so they dont go across the entire length, they #8217;re from my other tanks that were super overkill. i have one suspended and one laying in the center. filtration: 2x fluval fx6, 2x zeiss filters, back 1/3-1/2 of the tank is fully planted, and [the top has a planter going the span of the tank](https://imgur.com/a/qseWbyO) packed full of emersed plants to help with nitrates temp: 75/76F water changes: 30-50% 2x a week (could honestly go once a week since ammonia never rises and nitrates stay around or below 40ppm but i like to keep good habits) plant care: no constant ferts but i dose iron and potassium occasionally when i see needed. running co2 from a 20lb tank and have root tabs in some spots. inert gravel food: they #8217;re spoiled. fed 2x a day with a fasting day once or twice a week. they receive a big mix of pellets (i can list them out for you if you #8217;re interested), a mix of frozen food (can also list this out), a mix of repashy, and fresh veggies. i also buy a pound of duckweed every few weeks and let them go to town.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>goldfish are heavy waste producers, that waste turns into nitrates. you #8217;ll need to either add many more plants, increase the tank size so there is more water to dilute it, or you need to up your water changes. 10% a week is not nearly enough, you should be aiming for 30-50% a week at a minimum. goldfish are a fish that can handle larger water changes and actually do better with them being done. you wont lower nitrates any other way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i keep mine around 75/76. around 77 you can see them get stressed when kept long term. higher temps also lead to fungal infections in goldies as well as making them floaty (swim bladder disorder). just remember that the higher the temp the higher their metabolism, this means a faster growth rate but it also means you need to be feeding them more and in return, more frequent water changes. higher temp = more food = more poop = more water changes. if you aren #8217;t conditioning/power growing then i would drop the temp to 74/75.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>they are correct in that goldfish do put out a growth inhibitor and stunted goldfish still tend to live long lives. the issue is that all they focus on is keeping the water clean and not on the enrichment of the fish. i firmly believe in creating a home where the fish can thrive, not just survive. although a goldfish will live in a 10g if you do water changes constantly to keep it clean, it #8217;s not going to have the space to actually swim around and enjoy itself. fish are still living things that enjoy moving around, exploring, and interacting with their surroundings. unfortunately many people dont view it that way which is why you get ones insisting that as long as the water parameters are good, the fish is happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>depends on the goldfish. common goldfish like to stay cooler although they are fine in warmer water for a few months out of the year (spring/summer). id keep those between 69-73. fancy goldfish were bred to be more temperate and can be kept warmer. for most people i recommend keeping them 71-74 for good growth, better eating, and higher activity as lower temps make them lethargic. i keep mine at 75-76 but i feed more to accommodate the higher metabolism rate, have lots of oxygen in the water, and do much more maintenance on the tank to keep them healthy. any higher than that and you #8217;re dealing with fungal infections when kept for long periods of time. i breed/power grow/show my goldfish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>only way to remove nitrates is upgrading to a larger tank, water changes, and live plants. the first option should always be your first step since high nitrates will continually be a problem even with water changes. most goldfish will eat live plants and you will need a large amount to combat the waste from a goldfish. 10 gallons is far too small, people recommend 29g as a starting point but as someone who has kept many goldfish, a 40g breeder would be the smallest id keep a fancy goldfish in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i wouldnt. green algae is caused by an improper balance of nutrients, typically too much light. have you lowered the photo period so the light is not as strong and on for a shorter amount of time each day? if it is still there then you can use a uv filter temporarily till it gets cleared. its not recommended to run it continuously since the color of your water is a good indicator for any issues happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>a 125g is not big enough for all those fish tbh. the amount of water changes for an oscar/common pleco combo in a 115 would be ridiculous once they get to adult size as well, both are very messy. oscar will terrorize the acara and he may go after the silver dollars as well depending on its temperament. the bichir and common pleco wouldnt get along once that pleco gets to 12 #8221; and bigger. oscar will go after the bichir if you dont have enough hiding spots for it which you will need clear the bottom for the pleco once it gets 12 #8221;+. throwing a jaguar in there will make it all even worse since you will now have two large aggressive cichlids vs the smaller acara. the oscar and jaguar will constantly bicker and cause stress. this can definitely be done, just not in a 125.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you can get a pond planter [like this](https://www.chewy.com/tetra-pond-planter-basket/dp/155183) that will float at the top of your tank. depending on your tank it may be too big. you can make your own by buying a plastic mesh basket, pvc, and pvc 90 degree elbows. cut pvc to the size of the basket and connect it with the elbows to create a floatie that the basket fits perfectly inside. the pvc will keep the basket afloat and you can make small ones that you can sort the fry into directly in the tank.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my guess would be the food block raised the ammonia in the tank and the high heat lowered the oxygen levels in the water. did you have any additional airstones running in the tank for additional oxygen? higher heat = less oxygen in the water. i think those two reasons is what killed your fish. goldfish are heavy oxygen producers and from the post it seems the smallest fish survived which would make sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>singletail goldfish arent recommended to be kept with fancies since they are faster and more rambunctious. if your fancy is a female and the comet is a male then she will definitely get her share of abuse. pimafix also does nothing, its tea tree oil. for now i would add salt to the tank and see if that + clean water heals the wound. if you see it getting deeper or growing then you will need to use an antibiotic like erythromycin or kanaplex. those comets will need to be moved out of the tank sooner rather than later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you #8217;re correct with wakins and some other double tails, i didn #8217;t bring those up since they are pond fish and very rarely actually kept in an aquarium. you cant really buy them in a typical pet store like you can with comets so it #8217;s uncommon for unexperienced fishkeepers to stumble upon them. i still personally wouldnt keep them with commons or comets since they are slower and can get beat up during feeding and breeding times. i used to breed and raise them for a friend #8217;s pond for fun. i also wouldnt put a common in anything less than a 75g, they need that depth and length as they are very active and girthy. that #8217;s also speaking from personal experience of keeping and raising them. i dont agree with the heat method, heat speeds up bacterial infections (their cycle that is) so unless you are treating it with an antibacterial, heat will make the infection worse and cause it to spread quicker. it works differently with bacterial infections than it does with parasites which can be killed with heat often times. you actually want to lower the temps to slow their cycle so it #8217;s more manageable and is contained. lower temps + salt can do wonders for a goldfish. a salt dip isn #8217;t necessary as well, i would just dose the tank with salt. i always start with 1 tablespoon per 5 gallons and work my way up to 1 tablespoon per 2 gallons over a week. goldfish are very salt tolerant and if you have softer water, you can actually mix in a little bit marine salt to help add in all of the trace minerals the water is lacking that goldfish need. this isn #8217;t something i would recommend just anybody do though, you really need to know your water chemistry and what is lacking. this is all speaking from years of personal experience keeping, breeding, and healing goldfish (i rescue a lot and rehome). for op i recommend lower temps at 70-72 and salt. if the infection looks like it is spreading or the wound looks like it is getting red and hollow in the center then an antibacterial is needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>adding media from an existing tank isn #8217;t a guaranteed insta-cycle. your tank is cycling so small daily water changes need to be done till the bacteria catches up. you can also add something like fritz zyme live bacteria, just make sure the bottle doesnt smell like rotten eggs since that means the bacteria is dead. otherwise i have good experience with it, see if your lfs has it in stock and keep it refrigerated. seachem stability will also help but daily water changes are needed on top of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>not fin rot. she #8217;s an orchid tail so her tail is much longer and thinner than a regular oranda. it naturally tears at the ends while swimming, its why her dorsal fin looks perfectly fine and only her tail is torn. unfortunately nothing i can do about that except put her in a very shallow tank where she wont need to use as much force to swim. think of a large butterfly tail betta swimming and that #8217;s what kind of tail she has.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>lower your feeding to once a day. anubias and java fern are slow growing and consume very little nitrates so they wont really help solve the problem. you need to add in faster growing plants and/or emersed plants (pothos, floaters, etc) to help with nitrates. otherwise the only thing that can be done is lower stocking, lower feeding, increase water for dilution (larger tank), or more water changes. you can fast them for a week while doing water changes every 2-3 days which should help get them under control. as the fish grow it won #8217;t solve the issue long term though. id try and add as many fast growing plants as you can and partner that with less food + more water changes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey all, thanks for all the help yesterday. after a few hours at the vet i brought him home with me so someone could keep an eye on him all night. vet confirmed it was seizures but because we do not have his history, we don #8217;t know what caused them. he was put on meds and slept through the night, only getting up once for a potty break. since i dont have a ferret enclosure he was kept in a big dog pen with towels and blankets, i wasnt worried about him escaping. the vet said his prognosis isnt that good but the fact that he had no seizures (that i saw at least) during the night is a big improvement. he does unfortunately seem to have some neurological issues, when he woke up to use the bathroom he couldn #8217;t walk, only crawl. he is still sleeping soundly right now so time will tell if it improves. appreciate all of the help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>there are fish that interact with their environment and the substrate and there are others that don #8217;t (typically larger cichlids, arowanas, etc). large cichlids are often kept barebottom because of how messy they are and since they don #8217;t interact with the substrate, it serves no purpose but to collect detritus. you cant lump all fish into one category and someone spending money on 100s+ gallon tanks for their fish surely has their best interest at heart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no fish like to dig through gravel. there are sand sifters like corys, plecos, loaches, etc, but they wont dig through gravel. gravel vac is the best option and if your tank is fully planted so you cant use one then you can either just leave it as fertilizer for the plants or you can position a powerhead to skim the top of the gravel to rise up the detritus. once in the water column it should go into the filter if you have proper flow in the aquarium.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>there are only a few plecos that eat algae and even then, it #8217;s spotty at best. for algae removal id recommend a couple nerite snails (olives ive found to be the best but they all eat algae). those will go on the glass and decorations and actually clear algae off. bristlenose ive found will eat algae as they grow but stop once they get larger. you kinda need to starve them for them to really have a go at it at that point. they #8217;re also poop machines so make sure you take that into consideration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the overheat protection doesnt really work. if you really want to be safe you need a temp controller, the probe goes in the water and monitors the temp and if it goes above a certain degree (that you set), it kills power to the heater. as long as the heater has power it runs a risk of sticking on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no, realistically even one wont do well in a 20 long term. the larger fancies get 7-9 #8221; (body length so not including the tail) while the smaller ones like moors still get 5-7 #8221;. i recommend a 29g for a smaller fancy (moors, pearlscales) and a 40g breeder for larger fancies (oranda, ryukin, standard fantails, ranchu). you can do two of most fancies in a 40g breeder with good filtration. also, i did want to say that having a  #8220;good filter #8221; means nothing. fish poop converts to nitrates and nitrates can only be removed via live plants (which for goldfish you need *a lot*) and water changes. you can have the most powerful, best filter in the world and your goldfish will still be having issues and be sick bc of the nitrates. goldfish are very prone to nitrate poisoning, especially the fancies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey all! i need some advice regarding patty (the one on the left). sorry but this will be long so apologies for the blocks of text. i have had patty for about 7-8 months so far, she was purchased from an online retailer that im overall not happy with. the issue with patty is her body, she is *very* compressed, i initially asked for swim videos of her since in the online photos it looked like she may have issues but i was never sent any (one of my gripes with this company). regardless, she was shipped and i received her. from the first day she showed pretty bad swim bladder issues. i would give her weekly or bi weekly salt baths to help and i make sure to fast her once a week. she would be fine for a couple weeks and then get floaty again so id fast her 1 day, feed her frozen daphnia with vitamins the following day as a laxative (none of my goldies like peas so i use daphnia as a laxative instead), all while she is separated and kept in salt. after this treatment she would go back to swimming normal for 1-2 weeks before it would happen again. the longest she went without showing any floatiness would be like 3 weeks i would say. she has a hard time swimming in general since she is an orchid tail so her tail doesn #8217;t flow behind her like normal but opens up into an almost circle behind her. combine that with her body shape and she isnt the best swimmer. the issue i am having is that she became floaty about a week and a half ago and no treatment works. she is starting to get burns on her stomach from being stuck upside down at the top of the tank and while she tried to swim, she floats right back up. i did the salt treatment like normal, she was fasted for 5 days, and she was given frozen daphnia but none of it has helped. i did feed her and she is eating overall and in good spirits (active, tries to swim, no signs of lethargy or illness). i am very concerned about the burns and i have a feeling that she is just not going to improve from this this time. it has always been a battle with her from the beginning and i dont want this girl to suffer. im at a loss as to what to do with her, i can try to make her a wheelchair of sorts to keep her upright but that will cause issues long term. i really do not want to euthanize her since she is so full of life and shows no negative signs minus the swim bladder issues. if you were in my place, what would you do? just need some advice and recommendations regarding her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>these guys would benefit from fertilizer but otherwise are easy to care for. plant stem by stem about 1 #8221; apart and trim by cutting underneath a node (where the leaves come out of the stem). you can then just replant that trimming elsewhere in the tank. these do best as background plants since they get tall (mine are 1-2ft currently).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it could very well be the driftwood. in all honesty, sororities rarely last more than a year. my best guess would be the move itself caused this. sororities are a high stress environment at a default. when you packed up the tank and moved, you dismantled the hierarchy that already existed and when the bettas were placed in the tank again, they had to overcome new water conditions and the stress of reestablishing a hierarchy again. i think this stress lowered the immune system of the bettas enough to allow the first one to become sick. once one betta dies, its a snowball effect until there is only one betta left (the most dominant which is usually the healthiest). my recommendation would be to separate the remaining bettas and rehome them while only keeping one. you can try to reestablish the sorority but since you have dying fish, that #8217;s unlikely to happen successfully. dont add any new bettas in, thats a good way to start a war in the tank.</TEXT>

I just trimmed my pogos and have run out of tank space for them. these are grown submersed in high light + co2 but they will be perfectly fine in a low tech set up, just give them some ferts. they currently have really pretty purple ends but that will fade to green if not kept in high tech. no duckweed or snails in this tank but there may be some algae. *Shipping is flat rate.* * *Small box: $8.30* * *Medium box: $15.05* wysiwyg, stems range from 6 #8221;-12 #8221;+. will ship out monday and will be floated till then. stems chosen at random. [additional photos](https://imgur.com/a/nQplWOz) [a couple of them floating to show the purple](https://imgur.com/a/DiWRT5p) $.75 a stem, take all for $15 + ship. *22 available* Let me know if you have any questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i agree with you but it is important to set their expectations correctly from the beginning. it is always easier to buy the final tank from the beginning rather than constantly sizing up. a 30g will do perfectly fine for them for 2-3 months, an experienced fishkeeper can keep them in a 30g for 6 months but most people who aren't experienced with goldfish won't be able to do that without severely stunting them. most people, especially beginners, aren't knowledged enough to know when it is time to upgrade the tank and usually do so only when they notice the fish is noticeably stunted or they get tired of battling high nitrates. finding someone with a pond is a better option for op than dealing with trying to provide those goldfish a proper home. my original comment specifically said  #8220;long term #8221; for this reason because long term they will need a 75g. i never did say they need to go buy one now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in my opinion it doesn #8217;t really have a composition. it looks more like a snapshot rather than a photo taken with purpose. my first step would be to try and remove all of the people (or as many as you can). it is also very tonal, id add some whites and blacks into the photo to add contrast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah hard disagree, composition is one of the most important aspects of photography. composition is what makes the photo pleasing to the eye. how you compose a photo tells the story and your vision. if you ever study photography composition is taught before anything else. there is also a difference between a snapshot and purposeful photography. this looks like a snapshot, i want to clarify there is nothing wrong with snapshots but there #8217;s nothing to critique on since little to no thought is put into taking snapshots. a snapshot is captured vs created like a photograph. since op is posting in a critique sub im assuming they want to take photography seriously. the first step would be learning composition and thinking before taking a photo rather than just snapping pics. im sure op could have found a better angle that hides more of the people and makes the waterfall the focus of the image instead of it being filled with distractions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thank you! it is high tech and i installed co2 about a week ago on it so its still growing in. the background is lava rock and slate i siliconed on to a background support i made with corrugated plastic. there are three main chambers: a planter on the left, filter, heater, and pump in the center, and support for the waterfall on the right. top of waterfall is a holding box i made that has a lid covered in rock and the box itself is wrapped in lava rock as well. top is removable so i can access the little fog machine in the waterfall. there are two additional planters behind the tank that are siliconed in that still need to be planted with some ferns and other plants. you cant see from this angle but smaller lava rock covers the entire back of the tank with moss growing inbetween the rock, i was going for an ancient ruins kinda look with the statue and overgrown plants/moss. statue is a hand made medusa statue bought from an etsy crafts person that i covered to make sure it is aquarium safe. i took a couple progress pics but not as many as i should have, ill see if i can make an album of them. tank: low iron 25 gallon cube light: ai prime freshwater substrate: stratum filter: zeiss filter, i am installing a canister on it though in the future. still has work to be done on it but im happy with how it is turning out so far. lots of headache and time spent building it, i wasnt able to find any guides for making a waterfall on top/behind a tank, theyre all for pauladarium builds where the back glass is taller and supports the waterfall so it took some experimentation to get it working right. the waterfall extends behind the tank. i did make the aquarium stand out of butcher block as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i disagree, people giving incorrect medical advice can harm fish. people shouldn #8217;t be giving out advice without all the proper info, if a photo shows a very clearly sick goldfish you still want to know everything you can before making a diagnosis. if you aren #8217;t familiar with the fish you shouldn #8217;t be giving it at all. edit: i wanted to add that shortbodies are very common in most fancy goldfish types, it #8217;s a trait they are bred for by many breeders (personally not a big fan tbh). this body shape is common in goldfish other than yuan baos. that #8217;s what i mean by people diagnosing based on a photo that has no other information behind it or diagnosing a fish they are not well versed in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the ammonia test is known to throw false positives and show a .25 reading, this is a very common issue if you have any ammonium in your water. your personal experience varies from others so we should always be including that it #8217;s personal, not from a study, when giving recommendations. my personal experience is that they are basically the same as the api and tetra test strips. the aquarium coop vid listed above shows physical proof of this. every store i have been in and every farm ive spoken with all use test strips as well because of how quick and relatively accurate they are. ill probably run my own experiment to conclusively decide for myself which id rather use but i do not believe it to be true one bit that the liquid tests are more accurate. edit: opinions are often told as facts in the fish hobby. it is your opinion that they are better, it is others that they are not. until an actual scientific study is done then it will remain an opinion. it gets tiring reading comments on every post saying that the new hobbyist *needs* the liquid test kit when that is not the case. the test strips will work fine in *most* cases as long as they go with a reputable brand. if someone is on a budget or has 20 tanks then the test strips are a great choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>and the forum im on says the same as me. the point was not to state it as fact but to say it is your opinion before recommending them to someone. there is a difference between fact and opinion and we all need to be very careful with how we present both in this hobby. there is a trend of jumping on opinions and stating them as facts, like you did, and that can set a dangerous precedent if/when facts are presented that go against an opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the person that commented below provided some good info. to add on, you need to get that goldfish into a 20 gallon or about 76 liters to start. it will do fine for 6 months with good filtration before it should be upgraded to a tank double that size. orandas (including the variety you have) get a good 8-10 #8221; and are very girthy/chunky. they are also heavy waste producers and need very good filtration and clean water. the filter you provided isn #8217;t powerful enough for the goldfish. if you want to take this on and invest then i recommend picking up the liquid api test kit *or* api test strips. make sure to get a set that includes ammonia since those strips are sold separately. if you cant afford to give the goldfish a proper home then there is no shame in that, we recommend you try and find someone who can. you can try r/aquaswap or you can check the sidebar of this subreddit and find the link to local clubs. a local club should be able to find a member who can take it from you. as a last resort you can find a reputable, preferably family owned local fish store who can take it in. in the meantime i would do a 30% water change with dechlorinated water. try to match the temps as best as you can. i would do a water change every 2 days until the symptoms subside. alongside that i would pick up some aquarium salt (not table, marine, or epsom) and dose the tank according to the instructions for that salt. that will help ward off any bacterial infections.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the only live bacteria that has ever actually been live (for me) is the fritzyme 7. id see if a local store has it in (it will be in a fridge) otherwise you can order it on amazon. when it comes in give it a smell, if it smells earthy it #8217;s good if it has a decaying smell then the bacteria has died and id exchange it. when used it will cause cloudy water for a few days since you are introducing bacteria into the tank and it will appear like a bacteria bloom. this is my favorite way of helping a cycle along since you are introducing actual live nitrifying bacteria. partner this with prime and stability and do a water change today and another 3 days after its been added.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>we can only remove what we see or what is reported so if you do see anything that breaks the rules, report it. we are a small team so we can #8217;t catch everything. this post didn #8217;t have any photos which is why it was caught, having photos of the items you are selling is one of the rules. full disclosure and transparency is also a rule, if you are selling a piece of driftwood then you need to provide photos of it so users can see the piece they are purchasing. if you are selling shrimp, the photo must be of the shrimp *you* own, not a photo off of google. like i said, this is a hobbyist marketplace and not amazon or ebay. i understand that you are a business but you are still required to follow the rules so people purchasing stuff know the quality and condition that they are receiving. and stop being a smartass, we have many businesses selling a lot of plants and livestock on here who seem to have no issues following the rules. if you have 10 of a plant available for sale we obviously understand that you can #8217;t take a photo of each individual one, but maybe you can take one of the group of them or of the tank they are kept in so people can see the general size, color, and leaf quality of the plants. as for holding people to different standards, when you apply for flair you are told that you will be held to a higher standard than regular users. it comes with the responsibility of being flaired and it comes with the responsibility of being a business. at the end of the day, people need to see what they are buying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>too shallow. for plants you want 1.5-2 #8221;. fish dont add any co2 or fertilizer as an fyi, they do add nitrates which the plants absorb as one singular form of fertilizer. different plants have different needs and need different nutrients, the bacopa will likely be fine with just nitrogen from the fish but you may start seeing deficiencies which will need to be fixed with ferts. s. repens in my experience wont do well with basic gravel and no ferts, it wants a good, nutrient rich substrate to root into. the built in light should be fine for the bacopa as well. to clarify, if you have 3 stems of bacopa in the tank you will be perfectly fine. if you are fully planting the tank you will need additional fertilizer, just the nitrogen from the fish won #8217;t be enough. i actually dose (nitrogen-free) ferts into my goldfish tank every 2 days since the waste from the goldfish isnt enough to keep them growing. even though goldfish are heavy waste producers, the plants need additional nutrients besides nitrogen. keep an eye on the plants and when you see deficiencies, start dosing ferts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes, they are legal to own as long as they are brought in legally: i.e. captive bred. these are very difficult to breed in captivity so the majority of the turtles circulating the pet trade are  #8220;captive-raised #8221;, meaning the eggs were collected from the wild and raised in captivity. since they were raised in captivity they bypass indonesian export and us import laws. they are still illegal and unethical since the eggs are collected from the wild further hurting their already endangered status. like i said, it is very difficult to find captive-bred fly river turtles for sale since they are almost all being bred by conservationists who have zero desire to sell the turtles, they are trying to raise their group to continue the breeding effort. all captive-bred turtles come with paperwork guaranteeing as such and who they were bred by/where to keep record of. you have referenced many times in your post history, as far as i skimmed, that you don #8217;t care if the turtle is papered or how it was imported.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>that sounds like it was severely constipated and had some other issues, as much as fish eat they wont just rupture from overeating. if it was backed up and had a prolapse or ulcer burst that would definitely give it an appearance of the stomach rupturing. i appreciate the concern though, i actually believe she is eggy and thats why she #8217;s been even bigger than she normally is. i expect to see the male fanning the cave soon :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as far as the research i did earlier this year when looking into buying one, there are no known breeders in the us. refer to my comments below about issues importing legal fly river turtles. i agree about arowanas but im sure they have valid reasons as to why they havent opened them up to the us yet. maybe they #8217;re concerned there isn #8217;t enough to sustain the us market long term, look how many monster fish keepers there are and how popular monster fish are here. european markets tend to specialize in communities so arowanas arent that big of a seller there. im just speculating i havent looked into the stats of which country houses the most or anything, just throwing ideas out as to why.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it #8217;s likely stress. sororities are very stressful and disrupting the hierarchy by adding/removing fish is asking for trouble. based on the info you provided, id say that the stress of being in a sorority + having new bettas added + any illnesses that may have been brought in all caused enough stress for the bettas to die. fish have an accumulative stress response which means that any stress they experience adds and compounds together, it can take months for the stress to go away. i believe there was a study done that showed fish showing stress like symptoms from being netted for around 30 days. too much stress added right after each other can and does kill fish. r/aquariums or r/bettafish are better subreddits to post stuff like this on as an fyi</TEXT>

    <TEXT>-bettas should not appear bloated the day after a feeding if they are passing food correctly. -6 months is not a long enough time period to judge the success of a sorority -unexpected deaths do not exist, if a fish dies it #8217;s for a reason. a healthy tank should not have randomly dying fish -shadows and lights do not change the silhouette of the fish when it has a bright background and the fish is in motion -pro photographer by trade, i post lots of fish photography on here, feel free to check my post history good luck with the tank and sorority, i personally don #8217;t have anything against them but if you are going to do it you need to treat it like an aggressive cichlid tank and monitor it closely. this is coming from someone who has bred and kept bettas for years, including sororities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all! I #8216;m overgrown with pogo again so i did a small trimming. these are grown submersed in high light + co2 but they will be perfectly fine in a low tech set up, just give them some ferts. some stems have really pretty purple ends but that will fade to green if not kept in high tech. no duckweed or snails in this tank but there may be some algae. **~~1 package available: 17 stems for $10 + ship~~** *Shipping is flat rate.* * *Small box: $8.30* * *Medium box: $15.05* if you are local to the greater cincinnati area we can meet. these are very healthy and thick stems, grown in water. they #8217;ll take off in most tanks and you get better plants for about the same this plant costs in a store in a pot. [photos](https://imgur.com/a/V0HyL8y) [a couple of them floating to show the purple](https://imgur.com/a/DiWRT5p) i also have: **~~4~~ 2 packages of floaters, $4 each for a sandwich bag full.** *~~2~~ 1 packages are from my goldfish tank which is amazon frogbit and dwarf lettuce.* [photo](https://imgur.com/a/5dFLnJy) *~~2~~ 1 packages are a wild mix of random floaters from other tanks.* [photo](https://imgur.com/a/wAuvlbY) can be shipped with the pogo or separately.

    <TEXT>the temperature is going to cause issues long term, you only want to keep them at 78 for a few months and only when you are power growing (growing them quickly). they have very large appetites at that temp and need to be fed much more frequently with higher protein foods. they #8217;ll also become more aggressive and rowdy at those temps too. longterm it can cause issues with their organs and fungal infections. its also not recommended to keep goldies with fish that will nip at them like the shark and tetras will. goldies and plants are iffy as well, i have success with them not eating them but most people don #8217;t. reach out to a local aquarium club or r/aquaswap to see if someone can give it an appropriate home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>not sure if this is the right sub (please point me in the correct direction). i have a pet jumping spider living inside a decently sized terrarium. i have been catching her food every 2-3 days during the summer but with fall and winter approaching, it is getting more difficult to find moths and flys. she doesn #8217;t really eat crickets, does anyone have any tips or advice for culturing flying foods for her? the terrarium is taller than wider and she spends most of her time at the top so moths and flies work best for her. she #8217;s decently sized as well so smaller flies like fruit flies wont work. i appreciate any help! edit: she is a wild caught jumping spider located in ohio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>space is the issue currently. we were house shopping but the market is terrible rn so its been put on hold. i had brackish tanks briefly before but ive always wanted to really dive into it. you #8217;re right on the age factor, the type of water you have also plays a big role on when they need to be moved from fresh-brackish. i havent tested in a month or so but my gh was about 16-17 drops which is very hard, kh was lower at about 8 but still high enough to provide very good buffering capabilities, ph out of the tap is 8.4. this tank is dosed co2 and it drops to about 7.8-8. from the research ive done the minerals are more important than the actual salt which is why i think i have much better success with some brackish species than others would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>are you wanting to do an actual proper blackwater tank? or are you asking if the tannins themselves are harmful? tannins benefit 99% of fish and most fish thrive in tannin water. it provides security as well as micro nutrients that they utilize whenever they pass water through their gills (its why greenwater is so beneficial to growing out fish as well). a proper blackwater tank is usually very acidic and has a low ph/tds. fish that prefer harder water like (most) livebearers and african cichlids would not do well in this set up. tannins does not equal blackwater and tannins are more beneficial to fish/inverts than harmful. not all fish can live in blackwater conditions. hope that clarified and answered your question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i disagree, there are other safer ways to sanitize rocks than by boiling them. that is not something 99% of people should be trying, especially not beginners. baking at lower temps wouldn #8217;t have the same effect either. truthfully most rocks don #8217;t need to be sanitized, i #8217;ve power washed them to clean them but rocks in freshwater don #8217;t really house the same hitchhikers that liverock does in saltwater. a good cleaning/scrub is all that is needed and if you are worried, putting the rock in a bucket with hot water (not boiling) and vinegar should do the job. in op #8217;s case the rock probably has iron and that is what is discoloring the water. op wouldn #8217;t want to keep the rock in the aquarium because of this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>fires and boiling water are two different environments/situations. rocks are very porous and steam and water fill the little micro air pockets inside, at high enough temps those expand and cause the rock to explode. different rocks have different compositions so some are safe to boil but most people wanting to put a rock into their aquarium wont know if theirs is safe or not. fire does not have this effect. it #8217;s not necessarily the heat that is the issue but the water and steam that is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ember tetras really prefer more room than a 5g provides but experienced keepers can and do keep them in that size with the proper tank scape/design. if you are newer to the hobby and inexperienced then i would not recommend it. you will have an easier and more successful time putting them in a 10g or 20g long. ember tetras really thrive in big schools and it makes them more confident, 30 in a 20g long gives a really cool schooling behavior that you wont see in a 5g due to lack of space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i highly recommend picking a different fish to start your hobby out on, sororities very rarely last more than a year (when kept properly) and tend to collapse within a few months. if you are experienced and want to try it out it #8217;s one thing but a beginner delving into sororities is only going to leave you hating this hobby. it #8217;s very stressful on the fish and on the person since you #8217;re always walking a very fine line of something going wrong. i used to breed bettas, the most success i #8217;ve had with a sorority (and i #8217;ve tried many tanks/combos to experiment) was in a 40g breeder that was very densely planted and had lots of driftwood. even then it only lasted 7ish months. one betta finally got too stressed which caused her to get weak and it became a bloodbath. to put it kinda bluntly: experienced betta keepers/breeders rarely keep sororities and we all never recommend them for people starting out. i do want to try a sorority in a very large heavily planted tank in the near future, i #8217;m thinking a 125g with 15 bettas and lots of dither fish, just to see how successful it can be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i was saying that i used to breed bettas and have lots of experience with bettas, not suggesting you breed them. 5-6 is not a good number to start with, you want to overstock similar to an african cichlid tank. i wouldn #8217;t mix angels with bettas either. you can easily keep a nice single show male betta with a larger school of rasboras or tetras in a 32g and it will look full. a pair of angels would also work with a school of tetras if you wanted to go that route instead. sororities are just not a good idea for someone just starting out in the hobby. bettas are also typically bred in 2.5-5g tanks, you don #8217;t house the males and females together for a long time, only for the last steps of conditioning and during the actual breeding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>to answer your first question the answer is no, female bettas can and usually are just as aggressive as males, the aggressive nature was bred into both. someone above mentioned recommending wild types, i disagree unless you know what you are doing. wildtypes dont really look like the common, domestic betta we see but they can be just as aggressive. the common wilds you would see would be like the imbellis or the mahachaiensis which can be kept as a pair in a 32g given the tank is decorated properly, but even then the males tend to be bullies so you #8217;ll need ti provide plenty of cover and hides. the peaceful wild bettas they are probably referring to are for much more experienced fishkeepers, they require very specific water conditions and are usually kept in species only set ups. the most common of these would be the coccina, macrostoma, and channoides. they are much more pricey than a domestic betta on top of requiring a very specific tank set up so they are never recommended for community tanks. they #8217;re really fun to play around with though and i highly encourage it if you are interested in bettas once you have been in the hobby for a while. as for keeping a male in a community tank: definitely possible. it depends on the personality of the fish of course but the great thing is that a 32g proves plenty of room so you are likely to not have a problem even if your betta #8217;s personality is more feisty and angry. just add plenty of cover, plants, and decorations to create hides and break up the line of sight. ive kept every single betta ive ever had in a community tank (outside of breeding of course). as long as you set up the tank correctly, it is large enough, and you add the betta 1-2 weeks after the rest of the fish you should be fine. a king betta would work very well and will definitely take advantage of the full tank to swim. king bettas in my experience tend to not be as aggressive either but that will vary by fish. for fish to add id stick to peaceful tetras and rasboras. stay away from barbs, many like to nip at fins and can bully the betta. also stay away from fish with long flowing fins (guppies for example) since bettas tend to bully those and very large tetras (like buenos aires, congos, and serpaes), they #8217;ll probably be too nippy and rambunctious for a betta. as long as you take the time to plan what fish you want to keep and put effort into the tank decorating you should be fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>celestial pearl danios are very peaceful but they are pretty fragile and sensitive as well so id avoid them. neon tetras arent nippy and are commonly kept with bettas. chili rasboras would work, i actually have a big school with a betta in one of my tanks right now. if i were in your place i would do the king betta and 20 chili rasboras, they #8217;re pretty small and have a low bioload so 20 in a 32g is more than manageable. they do much better in a densely planted tank though, i recommend heading over to r/plantedtank to see some planted tanks for inspiration. you #8217;ll also find lots of answers to the basic plant keeping questions. by densely planted i mean something along the lines of what is shown on the box for the tank or something [like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/5f/18/685f189b5549487bd75061ca8068cac1.jpg). it may seem intimidating at first but there are plenty of easy to keep plants that will thrive for you. live plants are also very beneficial to the health of an aquarium/the fish and they will provide security for the rasboras from the betta and vice versa.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i ordered a justin bieber signed vinyl way back in january and it *still* hasn #8217;t shipped. they keep blaming covid but like homeboy should have been sitting at home anyway, ship him a box of the vinyls and have him spend a day of quarantine signing. for as much as we complain about shipping speeds with taylor shes doing better than many others and is at least actually putting in effort to sign them lol. i bought the vinyl for a friend who is a big fan</TEXT>

    <TEXT>68F is actually pretty low for fancies, they are more active and do better at 70-74F. if you dropped the temps recently that could be the issue. if you have airstones going you shouldnt have an oxygen issue at 72F.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i would. i personally keep mine at 74/75, i have found that to be the best range for optimal color, growth, and activity while not causing any issues longterm. once you start keeping them at 77/78 long term you can start seeing issues pop up. breeders overseas actually breed/raise them closer to 80, when i bred id keep the fry at 80 for the first 2-3 months and then slowly bring them down to 76.</TEXT>
