    <TITLE>Novel ideas to improve tournaments</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-12 00:45:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I'm running a local tournament in a few weeks and looking for some good novel ideas. This is our 7th year running, so we've got all the basics running smoothly. Mostly interested in some cool/memorable/interesting things we could do differently on top of the standard stuff. If you've ever thought wouldn't it be cool to have ... at a tournament, or why don't they ... at tournaments, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although it's self directed, I tend to think it's a bad look. Specifically in relation to SOTG, it comes under bad spirit in the category of self control and positive attitude (source http://wfdf.org/sotg/spirit-rules-a-scoring).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It will be very beneficial to have an honest chat with some of the women that you play with regularly. Ask them how they feel about how you play and behave. If you are looking for articles, try and read from female authors. From reading the previous replies on this thread, it seems that they are male voices (apologies if my assumptions are incorrect). There are some great points, but they all seem to be missing a component of perspective. I (a male player) have improved my understanding of the mixed game from listening and empathising to female players on the teams I have played with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You may find `Latexmk` interesting. It is a perl script that compiles latex. If you spin up a separate terminal and use the command: latexmk -pdf -pv example.tex it will compile your document into a pdf. Pretty handy, but, if you use: latexmk -pdf -pvc example.tex it will watch your tex file and every time it is updated (saved) it will recompile. This means that you can use vim to edit, and the document will recompile on each save. Just have to make sure your pdf reader can automatically update.

    <TEXT> gt;What are some good ways to eliminate this behaviour As you did, you have every right to tell the handler they are being double teamed so that they can call it themselves (at least under WFDF rule-set). Additionally, if it happens more than once and it is clearly intentional, I would bring it up with the player between points as it is in violation of the spirit of the game (WFDF 1.2 - It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules). Because of the way the SOTG is implemented, there are many rules which can be broken with no significant consequences. Therefore the best way to stop poor spirited play is to engage them in a calm discussion and hope they're not a complete jerk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I prefer to have better control over the text, so usually don't opt for any auto-running indentation package. Instead if I want emacs to automatically apply indentation I use `evil-indent` which is bound to `=` (vanilla emacs with evil-mode, but I assume it's the same for spacemacs).  #8203; It works as a verb, so `=ip` auto-indents in the paragraph, `=G` and `=gg` indents to the bottom and top of the buffer respectively. `==` indents the current line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your suggestion is not very empathetic to the person that commits the crime. I believe that, in general, we don't have "criminals"/"bad people" that commit crimes unless deterred. Rather we have people that are forced into crime by the combination of the culture they are surrounded by and their circumstances which often leave them vulnerable and desperate.  #8203; With this view in mind, it seems reasonable that we can try to rehabilitate the people that have fallen into crime, rather than making them more fearful, desperate, and helpless. There is of course another type of criminal that arises from mental health issues, where again I think that rehabilitation and proper mental health support is a better solution than just locking them up forever.  #8203; I don't know if you've looked into the effectiveness of your solution. I'm sure there are countries that currently have harsher laws that you could do research on. I would be very surprised if this was effective. I am aware that countries with very successful prison systems (ie. Norway) treat prisoners very compassionately.

Hence turnover. If the disc was thrown after the call then it would go back as the receiver left it, which affected the outcome. (Follow the branch of: \[disc thrown\] - \[completed: no\] - \[pick called during/after throw\]) For scenario 2: The disc will go back to the thrower if the pick affected possesion.

    <TEXT>The rules don't seem to explicitly address this situation, but here is my interpretation: Relevant rule:  gt;**13.4.** If a fast count occurs in such a manner that the offence does not have a reasonable opportunity to call fast count before a stall-out, the play is treated as a contested stall-out ([9.5.3](https://rules.wfdf.org/rules/2017/15-9-stall-count#953)).  gt;  gt;13.4.1. If the thrower contests a stall-out but also attempts a pass, and the pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands and play restarts with a check. In your case, 13.4.1 is invokes as the thrower throws the disc, however, as it is completed, the play stops the thrower marker should resolve the stall-out call. I think that the second pass occurs after the stoppage of play, so it has no effect. When you say:  gt;if players agree the stall out call did not affect the subsequent passes (no one heard the stall) I think only affects the first 'pass', not 'passes' The rule set can be found here: [https://rules.wfdf.org/rules/2017/19-13-turnovers](https://rules.wfdf.org/rules/2017/19-13-turnovers)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless I'm mistaken, this clip is from the EUCR in the UK so I would assume WFDF rules. That means that there are no "trained officials" that have the power to make calls. It is up to the players to decide. I don't think the strip call analogy is relevant here, as in that case a player is prevented from demonstrating sustained possession by being fouled. The absence of clear time duration is a good point, but I don't think that the split second the disc was stopped in their hands was enough time to demonstrate sustained possession (keyword being "demonstrate"). That said, I wouldn't be challenging the goal if I was there. It's just fun to nitpick the rules a bit, and I'm not a fan of showboating ;)</TEXT>

I'd suggest watching some vim beginner tutorials on youtube and/or use vimtutor. (Step 5). "i" puts you in insert mode, so you can start typing text into the buffer. You actually want to give vim a command, so after starting vim press ":" then type "e newfile.tex" (it should show up on the bottom row). If you're just transitioning from overleaf to local latex compilation, I'd probably suggest using something like Atom or VSCode rather than vim. vim is very different from any other text editors you may have used before; although once you do learn it, it's very useful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way that it works it by separating the drawing of the outline and the drawing of the "fill" since each square needs an outline regardless of whether it is filled or not. Hopefully I can explain it here: Loops over each x/y coordinates: Loops over each of the inputs to \squares (1, 2, 5 in this case): If the second and third args are equal, it draws the fill of that square (no outline) eg. for \n = 1 \squarefills{0,1}{1}{\n} has second and third args equal, so it draws the fill. Same for 2 and 5. Now we have three black(gray) fills and no outlines, so we draw the outline for every square with \squareoutline{\x}{\y} You can certainly use if/thens inside tikz. I just put them in the commands to avoid repetition. My solution is a bit ugly. My problem was that the computer doesn't know that (1,2) is the 0th square, (0,1) is the 1st, etc. If there was something similar to Python's enumerate in tikz the innermost loop could be reduced to one line of code and would be more intuitive (I think). The pgfonlayer allows us to ensure the filled squares are on a layer behind the outlined squares. For me the fills always ended up in front which didn't look good.  #8203; The problem becomes much easier if you are happy to draw outlines multiple times, but in my pdf viewer that resulted in bad looking lines</TEXT>

You'll get: \- For \\n = 2: foreach coordinate \\x/\\y a square, all unfilled except n=2 which is filled \- For \\n = 3: foreach coordinate \\x/\\y a square, all unfilled except n=3 which is filled \- Same for \\n = 6 You'll have 18 squares, with three at each coordinate.

    <TEXT>Looks like your main problem is with namespaces. You can't modify a global variable within a function (you can, but it's probably not the best way to do it). In your `grid_text()` function you are trying to modify the `grid` variable, but it won't change it outside of the function. My suggestion would be: 1. Move the grid variable on line 7-... into your `grid_text()` function. You can abbreviate it to `[[0]*9]*9` so that it fits nicely on one line (although looses readability)(I assume the 8 in the grid is a typo). 2. Rather than making the solve function work on the global variable grid, pass in the variable grid (change the `def solve():` line to `def solve(grid):`). Since you're using recursion, also make sure to pass grid into the `solve()` function call within the solve function definition. 3. Change the last two lines to `solve(grid_text())`. 4. If you remove the `time.sleep(2)` line your program will run 2 seconds faster. PS. looks like you've seen the computerphile video. Pretty good one if anyone else is interested in learning about recursion. PPS. looks like a cool application, but I can't condone using it to beat other human players on a soduko app...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ox-beamer setting different page style for title frame</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-30 06:13:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>TLDR: I want to know how to set a plain frame style to the first ox-beamer slide (title slide) from org-mode I'm writing a presentation in orgmode using the beamer export for the first time (I've used Latex beamer plenty before). My previous presentations written in latex have the first slide as: \begin{frame}[plain] \maketitle \end{frame} in order to remove the bottom bar that has the `author | title | date, pagenum`. When using org-beamer-export-to-latex I simply get: \maketitle which puts the bottom bar on the title page resulting in duplication of information on the slide. My question is: Is there any way to get the plain frame/page style for the title frame only in org-mode? Here is a MWE of the org file: #+TITLE: Title #+SUBTITLE: The subtitle #+AUTHOR: Author name #+BEAMER_HEADER: \institute[]{University of Example} * Beamer settings :noexport: #+OPTIONS: H:2 toc:nil num:t #+LATEX_CLASS: beamer #+BEAMER_THEME: Boadilla #+BEAMER_HEADER: \beamertemplatenavigationsymbolsempty * Introduction ** First frame This is the first frame - The bottom bar on this page looks good here - I do not want the bottom bar on the title page</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Toggle evil-mode</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-08 03:32:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Background: I typically use evil-mode, but sometimes like to disable it to use emacs keybindings. To do this, I'm trying to remap `"C-z"` to `'evil-mode`, but when in evil-mode, `"C-z"` is mapped to `'evil-emacs-state` despite my best efforts. The problem with `'evil-emacs-state` is that it is buffer local, but I want to turn off evil-mode globally. My efforts: I've created a MWE init.el file to try and solve the issue. Here is what I have, but it results in the problem above ;; init.el (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")) (package-initialize) ;; Bootstrap 'use-package' (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install 'use-package)) ;; Load evil package and try to bind C-z to toggle mode on/off (use-package evil :demand :ensure t :bind (("C-z" . evil-mode))) After loading, I've also tried evaluating `(global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'evil-mode)`, but the problem remains. Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm out of ideas.</TEXT>

I tried `(global-unset-key "C-z")` but get an error: `(error "Key sequence C - z starts with non-prefix key C")` Edit: didn't see your edit. That works. I've also defined "C-z" in insert state.

    <TEXT>We should be able to help you if you provide some additional information: 1. Which operating system are you using? 2. Where did you put your init.el? 3. What are the contents of the init.el? Assuming linux, the init.el can be placed here: ~/.emacs.d/init.el One thing to be careful of is that sometimes emacs will auto create ~/.emacs which takes precedence, so make sure to delete that (and any of the other methods you've tried). Next, to install a theme you'll need to download the package (probably from the MELPA repo) and load it. These days most people seem to use use-package for this, so a good starting point for your ~/.emacs.d/init.el file will be: ;; Call package manager (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")) (package-initialize) ;; Bootstrap 'use-package' (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install 'use-package)) (eval-when-compile (require 'use-package)) ;; Use use-package to download and load theme (use-package dracula-theme :ensure t :config (load-theme 'dracula t))</TEXT>

Here's a talk from a writer that uses org-mode as a scrivener replacement: https://youtu.be/FtieBc3KptU I should warn you that it won't be as user friendly as scrivener. It might take a bit of time to learn/tinker, but it will be very rewarding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one is an "emacs fan boy" before they start using emacs. It seems that people who are fans of emacs have tried it out and appreciated it. You might be surprised how little you have to learn to use emacs. You can just open it, load a file and start clicking and typing. You can even use the built in cua-mode to use Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V type keybindings. That's one of the nice things about it. You can go through the emacs tutorial in about 30mins and be competent enough to use it as a replacement for something like notepad++. From there, if you're content that's great. If not, you can keep learning and you have access to probably the most powerful text editing program around. The OP also mentioned:  gt; The learning curve is not an impediment to use any of these programs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ivy/completing-read interface to Deft</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-01 04:11:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been using deft for some time now, and find it really nice. The one gripe I have is the Deft buffer. Rather than using the deft buffer to search my notes, I want to have an Ivy/completing-read interface. Does anyone know of a good way to go about this? \--- **The workflow I want to achieve** is this: 1. From anywhere, invoke `my-ivy-deft` function which brings up the same completion candidates I would get in the deft buffer 2. Interactively narrow by typing into the ivy prompt 3. Pressing enter should do the same thing as in the deft buffer (if match is highlighted, visit the file, else, create a new note with the prompt as the title) \--- **Here is what I have considered/tried** before:  gt;Using ivy-read or completing-read as a wrapper to the deft functions My elisp is not good enough to do this. I've read through the deft source, but find it hard to understand what's going on. It seems to me that the deft functions are too tightly integrated with the deft buffer to be useful, but I might be completely wrong about this.  gt;Reimplementing the Deft package to suit my needs Again, I think my elisp skills let me down here. I'm trying to populate the completing-read candidates by reading file contents in my notes directory which is very slow. This led me to the next idea:  gt;Using counsel-rg This solves the speed problem, but I get tripped up on step 3 of the above workflow. Pressing enter on the match doesn't visit the file if I'm not in my notes directory. Additionally, the candidates aren't as pretty as in the deft buffer (although that's not a deal breaker, just a bonus). What I have so far: (let ((ivy-more-chars-alist '((t . 1))) (notes-dir "~/Dropbox/org/notes/")) (counsel-rg nil notes-dir nil "Notes: "))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Update: I've had another try. Turns out that the counsel-rg code I posted does work... Not sure why I thought it didn't. The advantage is that it is fast, but the disadvantage is that it shows a candidate for all matches in a file, while deft only shows one candidate per file (which I prefer) Here's my attempt at rolling my own solution that doesn't require deft: (require 's) (defvar my-notes-dir "~/Dropbox/org/notes/") (defun my-note-summary (fname) (let* ((lines (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents fname) (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))) (title (s-pad-right 30 " " (s-replace-regexp ".*TITLE: " "" (car lines)))) (contents (reduce 'concat (cdr lines)))) (concat title "| " contents))) (defun my-note-alist (fname) (cons (my-note-summary fname) fname)) (defun my-deft () (interactive) (let* ((notes-alist (mapcar 'my-note-alist (directory-files my-notes-dir t ".org")))) (find-file (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Notes: " notes-alist) notes-alist))))) Currently it works. The only thing not implemented is creating a new file if no match is found. I can live without this. I'll probably just make a `my-create-note` function or org capture template for this purpose). Since it is using the whole file as the candidate I'm worried that this is not a scalable solution. I have about 20 notes and the files are relatively short, but for much longer files or more notes I'm worried I'll start to see big slowdowns. Any ideas for improvement?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is already `python-mode` built in to emacs which will give you syntax highlighting. On top of that what I would recommend is a simple function to run the current file in python and display the output. Something like this: (defun my-py-eval-buffer () (interactive) (let ((fname (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))) (ftype (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)))) (when (string-equal ftype "py") ; check current buffer is .py file (save-buffer) ; save to ensure what is currently displayed is run (message "Buffer executed") ; give user feedback ;; Run file with python, display output in buffer *Output: python* (async-shell-command (concat "python " fname) "*Output: python*")))) You can map it to something like `C-c e` (remembered as C-c execute) or `C-c r` (C-c run). This is more than enough for 99% of the python files I create, and as you say you're just learning I think it will work well for you too. Once you start working on larger projects (multi-files) the two popular python packages are [elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) or [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've never really thought of using compile. I don't really understand how it should work with python. For example, if I create a file with the contents: ```python text = "Hello" print(text) ``` and use M-x compile, changing the prompt from `make -k` to `python`, It pulls up a buffer with a blank python repl that I can't interact with. My function opens a buffer with the text `Hello`. Then if I edit the buffer to: ```python text = "Hello2" print(text) ``` The output buffer now says `Hello2`. Python shell solution works fine, but I prefer to have a blank buffer displaying only the output (doesn't show prompts, old eval results, etc.). I guess the main reason is that the function does exactly what I want in a cleaner (that's probably subjective to me) way.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for solutions to export resume.org to both pdf and html</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-09 05:54:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been maintaining my resume in orgmode for some time now, with export to pdf. I just decided it would be nice to also export to html which has uncovered a problem. I'm using headings to list my previous jobs, with a macro that puts a date range on the same line, but right aligned. The macro uses latex to do the magic, which you can see below. I've also looked at replacing the macro with a tag, but tags don't seem to allow spaces or dashes. Wanted to see if anyone here has any smart tricks for the org file so that it will export to both pdf and html nicely. Here's a MWE of my resume org file: #+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil #+MACRO: date \hfill\normalfont{\small $1} * Job 1 {{{date(July 2019 -- Dec 2019)}}} /Description of job/ - This is the macro solution I am currently using. It doesn't export to html very nicely... * Job 2 :Jul2019Dec2019: /Description of second job/ - Here I am using a tag for the date - Problem is that I can't put spaces or dashes in the tag...

    <TITLE>Monitor toggling and different resolutions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-26 02:49:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, Wondering if anyone is able to help me with a little problem. I'm running bspwm on a laptop, but want to plug it in to a monitor and have the ability to toggle from one monitor to the next. Here is my script to toggle monitors using xrandr (eDP1 is laptop screen, DP1-8 is external monitor): #!/bin/bash displaptop() { xrandr --output eDP1 --auto  amp; amp; xrandr --output DP1-8 --off } dispdesk() { xrandr --output DP1-8 --auto  amp; amp; xrandr --output eDP1 --off } current=$(xrandr --listactivemonitors | grep -v Monitors | grep -Eo '[^ ]+$') nmonitors=$(xrandr -q | grep " connected " | wc -l) if [ $current == "eDP1" ]  amp; amp; [ $nmonitors == 2 ] then dispdesk else displaptop fi I have two problems: 1. ~~BSPWM still sees the monitor that xrandr has turned off, so the desktops seem to spread between the two. I want a bpsc command that will just move all desktops to a given monitor and ignore the other.~~ When I plug in the external monitor and run the xrandr command a new desktop is created which messes with my keybindings (super+{1-9} no longer goes to desktop {1-9}, it goes to desktop {Desktop,1-8}). 2. My monitors are different resolutions (eDP1 = 1920x1080, DP1-8 = 2560x1440). When I switch to the DP1-8 monitor, the nodes only take up the space within a 1080p box in the top left of the larger monitor. Here I want to "refresh" or "realign" the nodes so they fill up the whole screen (not sure if this is relevant but the polybar automatically resizes to fill the extra width). I feel like these two problems are easy to solve for a bspc guru, but I'm having trouble understanding the bspc man page terminology. Also haven't been able to find any examples of people toggling monitors this way, most multi monitor examples seem to be geared to using both at the same time. Edit: Another clue I just discovered. An extra desktop is being created at some point. Not sure why. If I unplug the external monitor, reboot, open a terminal and run: $ bspc query -D --names 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Then, plugging in the external monitor and running these commands gives: $ xrandr --output DP1-8 --auto $ bspc query -D --names Desktop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 There's an extra desktop created called "Desktop"... I've updated my first question to reflect this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This might not be what you want, but a couple of weeks ago I rewrote my resume template with orgmode in emacs. The way I've done it satisfies all of your points:  gt;Have a template that I can  #8220;hydrate #8221; with content from a text file (or group of text files) using the command line. Yep, the template is the orgmode file (plain text file)  gt;Specify which elements to include in the build, e.g. include an Experience section but not a Projects section. Experience/Projects sections are in the form of a top level heading. They can be removed from the export using a :noexport: tag  gt;Specify which subelements to include in the build, e.g. include work experience A and B but not C. Subelements are second level headings which can also be tagged with :noexport:  gt;From the .tex file, build not only a pdf but a plain text version as well. The .org file can be exported as pdf (via pdflatex), html, plain text, odt, and many more formats. Just need to setup the templates (I have the a latex template and a html template) Regarding your additional points, no experience with basictex, but the template can be changed to only use packages available.  gt;I prefer working out of the command line. These days it seems most people opt for the gui emacs, but it can easily be run in the terminal. If you're not interested in emacs, you could set up a shell script to run emacs in batch mode just to perform the export. Then you could edit the org file in any editor you want and ignore emacs. ~~Might as well put it up on Github for anyone that's interested. Check back in half and hour or so for the link.~~ Edit: Link to template is here: [https://github.com/jamesmaguire/org-resume-template.git](https://github.com/jamesmaguire/org-resume-template.git)</TEXT>
