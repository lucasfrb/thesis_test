    <TITLE>[TOMT] Far Side Comic</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-12-05 01:38:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Far Side Comic where a farmer is giving directions to a chicken and says "...of course that's as the 'crow flies', not as the 'chicken walks.'" The chicken looks very annoyed. I would even buy the book (again) if I knew which one it was in. Every time I'm in the bookstore I scan through the collections looking for it. It's my favorite far side comic.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-04-21 20:46:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bought the game a few weeks after it came out. Play a 1 or 2 hours most night. Hit level 20 yesterday. I listen to every to me cell phone for the story. I jog through NYC looking at the architecture. I can tell from extremely far away if someone is good or bad by their posture. I've experienced almost zero bugs besides basic things like having to restart a mission once. I'm dreading making it to level 30 where apparently according to Reddit, this game becomes a steaming pile of dog shit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Books for helping me deal with my spouse who has severe depression</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-27 17:26:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I posted earlier today and am grateful for the suggestions but realize that I wasn't clear. I don't have depression. I need help with dealing with my spouse, possibly helping her, understanding how to talk/listen/respond to her, and how to help our marriage through this. My spouse has always had depression and anxiety. I knew this when I dated and then married her. Recently, because of problems with our children, her depression symptoms have become much worse and are affecting our relationship. Edit: my spouse sees a psychologist and a psychiatrist and has had her levels checked. She's had this problem since she was a teenager. I'm not trying to help her myself. I'm trying to preserve and strengthen our marriage.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Back to the Future] How does Doc Brown account for the Earth's orbit when designing his Time Machine?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-19 13:46:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>According to Wikipedia the Earth travels 67,000 mph through space (I'll just ignore the fact that it's also rotating). It takes only seven minutes for the planet to travel the distance of earths diameter. So if this is not taken into account, when Doc Brown sends Einstein forward in time one minute I would think Einstein would end up either above the surface of the planet or buried deep within it by at least a couple 100 miles when he popped out on the other side of that minute. If you were to travel say, 30 years into the past I'm guessing you would end up in deep space nowhere near earth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For example: I am trying to do the Smuggler Interception Level 2. You have to fight two sets of smugglers and take their cargo.

However, now I can #8217;t find where the hell I #8217;m supposed to go (I open the area that talks about the mission to figure out where to go normally).

    <TEXT>Loved The Disaster Artist (Sestero  amp; Bissell) and Agent to the Stars (John Scalzi). Also, the parts I enjoyed in The Godfather (Mario Puzo) the most was when they were in Hollywood following Johnny Fontane at parties and negotiating contracts, etc. I really like reading about the movie making process, fiction and non-fiction, and about behind the scenes stuff like how agents do their job, how this actor hated this other actor, etc.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-09-14 13:29:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think I #8217;m one of those  #8220;used to be Alphas #8221; that got beat into submission. One of my kids (a girl) has a lot of emotional problems and that has made us focus on her instead of ourselves. I realize I need to be a man again (for me and for my son) and I #8217;ve been reading everything I can. I #8217;ve adopted a mentality that I will no longer be shaken by things or freeze up from fear. These are things I didn #8217;t do when I was young and I #8217;m sick of being like this. Maybe I don #8217;t understand the STFU approach well enough. I #8217;ve started working out and losing weight and started doing home improvement things on my own without discussing any of this with my wife. (In other words, getting off my ass and being a man again) This is not the problem. The problem is: What do I say or do when she asks me,  #8220;What #8217;s wrong? #8221;  #8220;Are you mad? #8221;  #8220;I was going to say we should go out to lunch but you look like you don #8217;t want to. #8221; etc? Also I think I have resting bitch face. I don #8217;t want her to think I #8217;m mad at her. I #8217;m just trying to do the STFU thing. Maybe I #8217;m approaching it wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After reading AWOL #8217;s book and reading through The A.T. Guide, I #8217;m a lot more relaxed about what gear I need on the trail, where to stay, how to get water, etc. However, I #8217;m still a bit confused about how to do section hikes. For example, if I do a section hike from Bears Den Hostel to Harper #8217;s Ferry I can see how I could reasonably find a ride between the two back to my car. But what if I hike the entire state of Pennsylvania? How does getting back to my car work? Any section hikers have examples?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My 11 year old daughter has mental illness and has rage, anxiety, and depression issues that absolutely consume my family. My family, my marriage, and my relationship with my wife and son are being destroyed because of this. We are literally in Hell. I have recently taken up hiking, camping, and Cub Scouts in order to get my son out of the house more and away from my daughter. I need help and I need to help my son. Are there any books you could recommend to help me derive more happiness from  #8220;other #8221; experiences (besides family and marriage) that I can then try to impart to my 8 year old son? I hope I #8217;ve explained this well. I really need something. Just FYI: We see several psychologists and psychiatrists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol. No, just kidding. I #8217;m from Miami. I know what you mean. There was a homeless man in Miami Beach who ran everywhere with a spork in his hand. He was never not running. He was ripped. One time he kept running across a draw bridge after the guard rails went down. I got so nervous for him but the guy manning the bridge waited. When spork man got to the other side he stopped as if he had won a race and raised his arms in a victory  #8220;V #8221;. It was one of the most beautiful things I #8217;ve ever seen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got my license at Skydive Miami. They may or may not get stoned on their own time but at work they were super professional and were overly cautious when it came to safety. The instructors there jump more than almost anyone because the weather is almost always good at least for part of the day. When I was going to Virginia for something I told one of the instructors I was going to look into jumping there. He warned me immediately,  #8220;Make sure you take a look at the place before you jump. If it looks like shit, or if there are people getting stoned, or if it just doesn #8217;t seem professional, don #8217;t jump with them. #8221; I have no problem with people smoking weed but this picture should have never happened. Hopefully the instructor was as surprised as he looks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m a registered Republican. I did not vote for Trump because I #8217;m not a lunatic (I voted for Hillary even though I can #8217;t stand her), but when he won I thought  #8220;let #8217;s give him a chance #8221; like I would with anyone else. Then, on the very first day, they lied to us about his crowd size as if we were North Korean subjects. His crowd size wouldn #8217;t have meant anything to me. It was raining. It was cold. Who cares. That doesn #8217;t mean anything. It would have been ok if his crowd size was small. But what does mean something is lying about it and telling us that we didn #8217;t see what we saw. That was the very first day and every single day has been worse than the last and that #8217;s without even counting the treason. We are living in a nightmare. I don #8217;t care if a rock is running. If it has a D by it #8217;s name, I #8217;m voting for it. I #8217;m never voting for a Republican again. That party is dead to me. Fucking traitors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since tipping is based off of a percentage of the bill, unless I #8217;m totally confused on what math is, I #8217;d say it has something to do with math. You just wrote  #8220;I #8217;ll tip 100% #8221;. How would you know how much that is? That #8217;s math. And just so we #8217;re clear. In a hypothetical situation: you #8217;re on a business trip, you go to shenanigans by yourself to have grilled chicken and broccoli, you receive the bill and it #8217;s $10, you would then leave $20+ on the table? I was a server in college. I was very good at my job. I got excellent tips. Nobody left me $20 on a $10 bill. And tipping at a bar is a totally different thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was hunting the legendary white bison. I see it in the distance. I pushed the aim button but instead of aiming at the bison it aimed just a little to the left. I let off a single shot before refocusing on the bison and then killing it. I skinned the bison and placed it on my horse and then looked at the map and said to myself,  #8220;oh, this is the area where the white Arabian is, I might as well find it while I #8217;m here. #8221; Then I remembered that I had shot a deer or something while I was trying to shoot the bison so I rode over to the X on the map... The white Arabian lay dead in a pool of blood stained snow. I felt physically ill after that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was a kid my step-mom #8217;s dad had Alzheimer #8217;s. We were going somewhere at night (in 1990) and he was concerned because it was dark. My dad had to show him how the headlights on the car would light the way. On our way that night, every time a car would pass, he would excitedly say,  #8220;hey, that car has lights too! #8221; My brother and I were giggling at this until I noticed my step-mom in the front seat was silently weeping. I hated my step-mom but I still felt bad for her in that moment. Alzheimer #8217;s is a terrible terrible disease.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(IMO) It #8217;s not quite the same thing. When you have a kid, you #8217;re suddenly somewhat desensitized to puke, piss, and shit. You #8217;re dealing with the second two constantly and you #8217;re going to get some on you sometimes. One time my son (an infant at the time) had a diarrhea explosion at the airport and I had to cut him out of his onesie at a gas station or else he would have got diarrhea on his face. While I was cleaning him, I of course got it all over the shirt I was wearing. This time it was my mom that was not only crying from laughing so hard but was taking pictures while I was doing it. When I finished I just took off my shirt and threw it directly into the gas station garbage can. I think it was around 20 degrees outside.</TEXT>

And then do you remember thinking,  #8220;Seems pretty accurate to me. #8221; I was fucking Cinderella you bitch. (I #8217;m a guy but Tangled and Cinderella are about me and my stepmom) I #8217;ve been NC for 5 years with the help of my wife (because my wife doesn #8217;t take shit). I only wished I had done it sooner. It will always be difficult because my dad, who I worshipped even though he was an enabler, is a package deal with her and so I never get to see my dad again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit: I believe this may have been an  #8220;ambien comment #8221;. I have no recollection of writing this. Decades from now a young man who lives alone in a village of 273 people will find this photo. Wuhan? He #8217;ll ask. I wish I can some day go to Wuhan or any Han for that matter. He has only lived in this village his whole life. He lives in the back corner of the grocery store where they used to sell milk. The rotting food was removed years ago and the windows were all boarded up. He has an air mattress and what is left of a tattered sleeping bag. The bag lasts because he has become excellent at sewing. The air mattress is covered in patches. He hates when his butt sinks to the ground while he #8217;s sleeping and so he has slowly become an air mattress patch expert. Others in the village come to him for help with these matters and trade a corner of bread loaf, or a knife with no handle, or some other useless junk that he somehow makes useful again. He #8217;d like to patch bicycle tires but he #8217;s only ever seen one bicycle and it was owned by a crazy man who came through the village shooting a gun once into the air and once into his head. Sometimes the gun went off and sometimes it didn #8217;t. He was not successful in blowing his brains out but he did shoot a handful of shots into the sky until he got to the pee wee football field where he shot his entire lower jaw off. He wondered around the football field after that. Bleed profusely, trying to talk but really just mumbling spits bubbles. Some of the folks watching this turned and vomited. A starving dog nearby world down one pile of vomit and ran off tail wagging. Finally, ol #8217; bleedin #8217; to death no jaw fell down and slowly stopped breathing. As he lost consciousness he saw an ant climb onto his eye. He hoped it would be cool tonight. It was too hot today. The men came down with shovels and did a large whole next to ole Half a face. They pulled him and his bike into the hole, threw some white powder in there and the covered up the whole. And now even though he wanted to patch bike wheels, there were no bikes even though he knew exactly where #8217;s one was. He writes down the word Wuhan in his tiny notebook he found in the caved in Kmart where the troublesome people live. Yes maybe he will go to Wuhan one day. He feels it is close. But he is also interested in the young woman who lives in the shed across the street. He thinks maybe they will one day grow old together. He is optimistic because people don #8217;t die as much as they did before the culling because the smart woman in town has a lab and she takes microscopic pieces of live or dead viruses and injects them into you. She seems the smartest so we do what she tells us. Also she said should give the babies peanut butter when they #8217;re born. Everyone in town takes these shots and nobody know he has a picture with a guy from Wuhan. So, it #8217;s been a pretty good day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m a white male. My dad was a public defender for 35 years. I was taught as a child that certain laws are purposely written in such a way to put a disproportionate amount of black people in prison. For example: sentencing for drug charges. The sentence for possession of crack is three times the sentence for cocaine. They are the same exact drug just processed differently. But, cocaine is predominantly used by white people and crack is predominantly used by black people. There is no coincidence that laws are written this way. It is on purpose. And it #8217;s disgusting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s funny though because Bob Dole changes his position in real time. Although I #8217;ve never really understood why it has to be what the candidate  #8220;believes #8221;. For example, what if Biden said,  #8220;Look, I don #8217;t believe legalizing marijuana is the right thing to do because of x, y, and z. However, since we know that the majority of Americans support legalization, I won #8217;t stand in its way since that is what the people want and I represent the people. #8221; I say this instead of the candidates having to constantly flip flop on the issues. Just say, I believe this way but I understand Americans want it this other way so that #8217;s what we #8217;ll do.</TEXT>

My cat took a nice shit on a bath mat that could be washed (instead of the carpet) and jumped in an empty laundry basket to pee (the laundry basket contained all of the urine and none got out). I am convinced that he did these things so that it would make as little mess as possible. It was one of the most considerate things I #8217;ve ever witnessed.

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t even imagine that pain. I #8217;m sorry that happened to you. Not long after college I lost three of my best friends to horrible car crashes and another close friend to a disease so rare that they basically don #8217;t even try to find cures for it. Losing these people has had a damaging effect on my whole life since then. Almost 20 years now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It #8217;s my cake day so here #8217;s an N story about a cake and some quick fire short stories about my NStepmom.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 16:00:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I was a small child (third grade) I was already responsible for doing all chores. All. Laundry (including my parent #8217;s and brother #8217;s). Garbage. Dishes. Lawn work. Everything. I earned no allowance. After my birthday party, after I was admonished (AKA lectured for more than an hour) for not profusely thanking my Nstepmom for giving me a birthday party I had to clean everything up. I took out the trash including the cake box. As far as we can figure, the special engraved cake cutting knife from my parents wedding was in the box and got thrown away. I was blamed for this for close to 15 years. I was told while visiting my grandfather #8217;s grave (Nstepmom #8217;s dad) that I was just sad because he was  #8220;no longer here to GIVE you things #8221;. I was in elementary school. I was told repeatedly starting when I was in preschool by my NStepmom that my dad and mom got divorced because my mom cheated on my dad and got VD (I think she told me it was herpes). I was told that my mom was such an unfit mother that the judge chose to give my dad custody. I was told that this was extremely rare so that my mom would seem to be even more of a monster. The truth is my dad was an attorney and knew all the judges. I went to a prestigious college for free because I did well in High School (I don #8217;t want to say where). My parents never sent me a dime even though they no longer had any bills where I was concerned (I also lived there). I never complained as I #8217;d learned never to ask for anything. When my brother ended up attending the same school years later I asked him about if the same odd jobs were available in the local community (yard work, valet parking) to earn money he said,  #8220;Why would I do that? Mom sends me a check every month. #8221; My NStepmom also would complain to people about the $1500-$2000/year they had to give to the school to provide for books and haircuts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our PE teacher in elementary school was verbally abusive to all the kids. He would talk shit about our dad #8217;s jobs or demonstrate how stupid we were. He was a real piece of shit. After 6 years of this, one day I just snapped for half a second. I was throwing a football with a friend and the PE teacher was standing close by. Without warning I threw the football as hard as I could and hit him in the side of the neck. You know how getting hit is even worse when you aren #8217;t expecting it? He turned and lunged towards me saying,  #8220;You son of a bitch! #8221; Luckily it was more than a few steps and he realized that he was about to strangle a 6th grader. He turned and went to his office and never spoke about it again. Years later I figured out he was an alcoholic and that he was drunk in our classes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it was. It was the first time they ever got cameras inside an actual tornado. It #8217;s interesting too because one of the storm chasers actually breaks up with his girlfriend and ends up with another storm chaser. It #8217;s probably the best documentary I #8217;ve ever seen besides Cocaine Cowboys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once witnessed an autopsy in the  #8220;decomp #8221; room in Baltimore of a guy that had been in the water for three weeks. He did not look good. They pull your face down over your chin in order to separate the skull and extract the brain. I guess there is some sort of negative pressure in your skull because they have to use a suction cup to pull the top of the skull off and it makes a popping sound when it separates. Also the doctors and nurses wear absolutely nothing in the way of safety equipment. No goggles, no masks, nothing. There are no white sheets covering the bodies and in Baltimore there are a lot of bodies and they #8217;re all naked. They all look like Jessie Ventura after the Predator blasted his rib cage apart. The smell in the decomposition room is the worst thing imaginable. The doctor asked me if I wanted to help slice up the brain which he was doing as if it was a prime rib. I told him I was dealing with just being in the room. Watching an autopsy was one of the most violent experiences of my life. It was like witnessing a rape.</TEXT>

Sure, I think rich famous people should pay more taxes but that #8217;s not this. Famous people shouldn #8217;t be hounded and made to hide from paparazzi. They shouldn #8217;t get pictures of themselves naked in their own house by someone with a telephoto lense. And they shouldn #8217;t be held hostage by their father and not be able to use the money that they fucking earned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw people speculating what would happen if his reserve chute didn #8217;t open. You fall 1000 #8217; every 6 seconds (probably slowed down slightly by this faulty chute). He #8217;s at about 4 or 5000 #8217; so he #8217;d have approximately 24 to 30 seconds left if his second chute didn #8217;t open. Having said that, while one chute malfunctions every 1000 jumps, two chutes malfunctioning is so rare that it #8217;s not even worth discussing. The second chute is painstakingly packed and inspected by an independent third party and spring loaded. If you were so unlucky that both chutes failed then it was your time to die regardless.</TEXT>
