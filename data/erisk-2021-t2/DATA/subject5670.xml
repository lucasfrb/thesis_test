    <TEXT>Maybe my expectations were too high but I was atleast hoping for more options. You always have to do what Henry does and often you, the player won't even get a choice. You *have* to bury your parents. You *have* to drunk-fight Hans Capon. Actually I tried running away from him, but then se same damn cutscene appeared anyway. Most quests you won't get to make any decisions (one good example was the beggar vs shopkeeper argument you had on that guard duty). I'm not very far into the game and I do enjoy it but it seems they wasted a lot of potential.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-15 07:30:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was relatively skinny my whole life and don't really know much about cutting, hovewer I definitely need to get a better form for the summer. I don't understand tho.. most men, on a cut, eat around 1600 - 2000 calories. Most of the time, the recommended deficit is around 500. So you'd need to burn almost 2500 calories every day! Lets say you're able to run 7 Miles Per Hour, that's a feat most people wouldn't manage to do. I've used some online calculators and thats only 800 calories for a 160lbs man like me. You would need to run for like 3 hours every day, at an insane speed that you would probably not be able to maintain, after 8 hours of working. And thats only running, which is one of the most efficient ways to burn calories. I also get that you burn calories normally, but that isn't much. So my question is, there must be something I'm missing, what it is?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How much watermelon is too much watermelon?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-01 14:55:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it's summer and I usually eat one watermelon a day. I buy them at around 8 kg (18 lbs) and slice them into two halves, then eat them when I'm the most thirsty (after waking up and after a workout). I don't eat the green part (lmao) so I eat around 6 kg / 13 lbs of watermelon a day. Any downside to this? Google says that's like 2k calories (and I still eat around 2k calories worth of normal food) which would leave me at a big surplus, but I've been doing this every summer for years and I never noticed any weight gain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was so happy around minute 13, when Lelouch wants to execute his opponents. I saw this scene once on youtube and it was what made me watch this anime. I was like "yes this is the MC I want". Call me sociopathic but seeing Nunnally in chains was a great feeling, because for a moment I thought that Lelouch has overcome his biggest weakness that cost him so many battles. But, then I saw suzaku in Zero's costume and it all clicked. This ending was bittersweet and sad but good regardless. Still, anyone else would be much happier if Lelouch actually was a tyrant that dominated the whole world? I really wanted to see it happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know about you guys but even though I love alicization I don't think any anime has ever beaten the first 15 episodes of the first season. Every time I rewatch it I am reminded of how perfect it is, the pacing, most of the side characters are at their prime, Kirito being just overall cool (okay Kirito and Eugeo bromance might be even cooler, but still..) the romance with Asuna and the emotional ending with Kirito waking up and walking as the ending plays. I mean, this might be just an aincrad arc appreciation thread but most of the latter arc's plotpoints stem from it, which proves something. You guys think it too?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember literally everyone was shit talking people who predicted stuff like 1 billion Detective Pikachu and other high numbers for this movie. On the OW of that movie, most threads consisted of marvel fans saying "muhh biggest franchinse ever hahahhaha". BUT, even though it is clear now that Endgame won't pass Avatar, everyone is silent for some reason. Because last time I remember, for every person that predicted 1 billion Pikachu there were 5 others who predicted 3B for Endgame, yet nobody is saying anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I realy wonder why do people think TS4 has a chance of being the highest grossing animated movie in 2019. Imo Frozen got really huge only AFTER it left the cinemas, thanks to all the insane merch and stuff, and I feel like this sub is seriously underestimating it. TLK probably counts as a live action too, no? (even though it will be all CG?), so it won't be competing in the same category, but I really believe Frozen 2 will beat even TLK. You guys?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone says this hero is great at laning but I always get absolutely shit on lol. Last 3 games were against Storm, SF and Lion and they consisted of me Qing the ranged creep then going back to farming those 2 jungle camps. What's the secret? So many people talk about high early game kill potential with brood but how do you even kill someone? They just run away if you don't skill the passive (am I supposed to skill it?) so most of the games I just rush diffusal after soul ring. People say that brood is auto win against invoker but how? He has higher dmg and can nuke you pretty easily I just don't see it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Blizzard made a server where you only have 1 life. Inspired by the ironman challenge. Now people would be forced to group up for even smaller objectives. Dungeon grinding would need to be nerfed a little I think (maybe make it so you can run the dungeon only 2 or 3 times) but here comes the best thing: imagine the economy! Since venturing out into the wild is now pretty dangerous, various things would be much much more expensive. You would really fear for your (character's) life since the hundreds of hours put into one could be deleted in a few seconds with one death. it would feel like really being in the world yourself.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-29 11:53:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly, I loved it. The gunplay, the companions, being able to kill everyone and all the little details. And I can't wait to go and try a corporate bad guy playthrough - because I wasn't really satisfied with the good guy one. I was expecting morally grey factions and choices, and I definitely got that in the side quests, but the main story, atleast to me, felt like an afterthought. There are only 2 factions you can choose - be one of the bad guys..who don't have a single good thing about them, or help the Doctor Jesus that's the embodiment of niceness. It was really black and white, compared to New Vegas where you get 4 choices that are all morally grey, even the Legion had some the right idea in some areas (you can see that in the fanbase as well, lots and lots of memes about supporting the Legion and Caesar) but I doubt anyone will do that for the Board and Rockwell. And the main missions weren't that fun either, just shooting stuff, no deciding or choices. I'm going for a bad guy run now, which I heard is better. Again I really like this game but the main quest is imo pretty weak.</TEXT>

World PVP is my favourite part of the game but when I stomp players who are outnumbered by such a large margin I feel bad. I even stopped engaging when I see one, and I'm one of those red is dead people. I feel like phase 2 being released will definitely be the last nail in the coffin for this kind of servers, so what's the point?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I read manga or LN after anime (and from where)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-30 09:58:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I just finished the anime and want to continue ahead since I absolutely loved it. Seriously it was so fucking good. I don't mind if it's not translated since I would probably get the japanese paperback version anyway. So anyway how far is the manga? I would prefer to read that but depending how much it's lagging behind I will continue with the LN. Also on what volume should I start. Please don't say volume 1 I don't think the adaptation skipped much and tbh I can't bring myself to read something I already watched. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or instead of development, something more like a dream, a goal to work towards? I think we can all agree that Fuutarou is one of the most interesting harem rom-com main characters of all time. He got plenty of cool moments and panels. Until about chapter 90 that is. Is it just me or was he, in the last third of the story, kinda forgotten? I mean all of the girls had dreams that they successfully fullfilled (idk about yotsuba ofc), but Fuutarou's dream was to become rich right? Sooo..did he? Or what the hell happened to him? Are we seriously fine not knowing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean the fight is all cool and stuff, but it feels like the demon slayers are doing literally nothing compared to Tamayo and her asspull medicine effects. We haven't seen her for like 140 chapters but right now she's the one doing everything, along with Yoriichi. I mean, I guess that a lot of people like her, so this is going to be a very unpopular opinion, **but I find her really, really boring**. Her personality is just Shinobu v2 and everytime a new medicine effect is revealed with 0 foreshadowing I'm kinda dissapointed. It makes the characters who are actually cool, the demon slayers, look incapable of doing anything other than parrying Muzan's beyblade attacks. (Don't forget that this in turn makes all the upper moon demons who lost to them look bad.) Sorry if this comes off as rude and I'm interested in what other people think about this.</TEXT>

(probably not good to think about dropping out before I'm even enrolled but whatever) Anyway thanks for the encouragement!</TEXT>
