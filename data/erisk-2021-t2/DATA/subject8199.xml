    <TEXT>I avoided the gym like the plague. The reason? When I was 17 I was spending a weekend in a hotel. They had a gym and I wanted to try it out. I had never been in a gym before. I had never partipated in any sports. The closest I ever came to working out was when I watched Jackie Chan movies and jumped around trying to imitate him. So in the gym everybody minds their own business and I try to blend in. I casually walk to the dumbbells, chose one which I think will make me look manly (I think it was the 30 lb one), I try a biceps curl....aaaaand I end up pinching a nerve in my back. Still trying to save face I slooowly put back the dumbbell, grit my teeth and crawl back into my room. I spend the next days on painkillers and I would avoid the gym for the next years. Fast forward to 2010. I am finishing my PhD. I am 20lb overweight (5 foot 7 (1.73 m), 196 lb (89 kg)) at that time) and had just collapsed at work. The diagnosis: burnout / depression. I was keen on being dependend on antidepressiva. So after I barely manage to graduate I sell all my stuff and fly to a small island on Thailand were I sign in for 5 weeks of Muay Thai classes. I get the shit beat out of me on a daily basis. The Thai trainers all have this polite grin in the face when they throw me around. I crawl out of the gym every time the training is over (two 2 hour sessions per day) and I am absolutely loving it. After the 5 weeks are over I lost about 18lb. I had thrown the pills away in my 3rd week there. And I swore to myself that this would never happen again. Now I live in San Diego (just a 2 hour drive, I would definitely come). I hit the gym 3 times a week. No depressive phases for the last two years and working out had a lot to do with it. My training is nothing special, just enough to feel good. Reading this subreddit motivated me to try out more things in the gym, what to do, what to avoid. You guys have no idea how much you changed my life. Thanks. Edit: Changed the kg to lb. Sorry, I still think in metric.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! What is exactly is your situation right now? Are you free to travel? If yes, I would really recommend a change in scenery. I hate to admit it but the meds really helped me getting started. Before them I would just sit there, not being able to do anything. I had these random thoughts: "Do something! Move! Meet with friends!" but then my mind would get numb and I ended up staying inside hating myself. Once I started medication I was finally able to make a plan and follow it. Still hated it though, because it hurt my pride being dependent on meds. But you have to swallow that pride. Good luck! Let me know if you want to know more.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-10-17 21:26:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>This might sound very retarded to you: Soon I will have a daughter and we are planning to make a time capsule for her which she would get when she is 18. One thing we thought about doing is buy 100 USD worth of stocks of companies which went public during the week she was born. We would not look at the stock performance after the purchase, just leave it and forget about it. My question now: Is it enough to have the printed stock certificate in case you want to claim ownership of the stocks in the future (should the company still exists, that is)? Or would we still be required to keep the account of the online broker we used for the purchase? Thanks for your help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>35y old now. I had a pretty violent childhood, thanks to a violent, abusive father. Luckily I discovered libraries at an early age and the main characters of the books I liked became my role models. This had the disadvantage of me often strictly thinking in black-and-white terms, it took a long time until I learned to accept middle grounds. On the other hands it made me realize that my childhood was rather the exception than the norm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last December, my daughter was born. One thing we are doing right now is putting together a time capsule for her. Mostly it contains messages from the family, magazines and some random stuff. But we also wanted to add some monetary value to it. At the time we started with the time capsule we started to learn about cryptocurrencies. I thought this might be something nice to add to a time capsule. The plan is to give her the capsule for her 21st birthday, by then it hopefully should be clear, which currency survived these turbulent times and which didn't. I recently bought one Bitcoin and put it into cold storage. I have done the same with one Litecoin and one Dogecoin (not because it looks promising but because it was funny). Over the next weeks I want to add several other coins, but I am still reading up on them. This is how stumbled upon VTC and from what I read it seems to have great potential. I have to confess that I am not too tech savy, I don't even have a smart phone. Therefore I will most likely not be one of those guys who uses cryptocurrencies in everyday life, actively working on the success of them. I just think it would be a nice extra when my daughter opens the capsule in 21 years and see what got so many people excited in 2013/14.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thoughts on promoting Dogecoin</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-02-17 05:26:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been following Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies for a while and have to say that this community is bar far the nicest one out there. I wish Doge all the best and hope that it will a common method of payment in the future. I was wondering whether we could have a clear and visible link on the sidebar which links to all the places where you could actually spend small amounts of Dogecoin for something. This could be: Small mobile games where one Doge equals one Token, Dogecoin Wallpapers, certain flair or maybe just the link to a foundation of choice. Currently I see four main groups here: 1. "Gamblers": Having missed the BTC train they hope to get lucky with Dogecoin and buy as much as possible. However they do not plan to use it but to sell it when it has increased significantly in value. However they are not really interested in helping to promote the coin either, betting that other will do the work for them. A subpopulation are "Scammers" who are using the goodwill of the following groups to earn Dogecoins. 2. "Jokers": They like the community and the fun that comes with it. They enjoy the ride, show appreciation of like minded people with tips and are happy for everyone who joins them. 3. "Enthusiasts": They could write you an essay about the blockchain, understand the technical differences between various coins and really work hard to promote Dogecoin. They organize charities, help businesses accept Doge and still have plenty of fun. 4. "Young shibe": They might have heard about bitcoin (from the frontpage) and some nice person on Reddit once gave them a tip. They have no idea what to do with it. Some of them clicked "accept"... My concern is now is with group 4, the Young Shibe. We now have a population of users with maybe 20 to 100 Dogecoin but no idea what to do with that, how to use it and therefore no intention to further invest into it. This is like getting a 20 cent Casino chip in Salt Lake City. You know it is worth something but around you there is nothing you can do with 20 cent worth of chips and you are not really interested in buying more chips in order to buy other stuff. Which brings me back to the paragraph in the beginning: Making it easy for newcomers with no real incentive to invest to spend the small amount they have. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Warning: Can't provide any source, you will have to listen through his podcasts if you want confirmation. I can't find the podcast but he once said that once you are on stage you do NOT apologize for anything you say. It will instantly make everybody turn against you, because you are suddenly not a comedian anymore but an inconsiderate asshole. You are basically forced to be in combat mode and try to shoot down everything in your way. While the famous Philly incident is usually brought up in this context (hecklers) Bill himself said at that moment he was not trying to be funny. He was just angry and out for blood. He is in such a rage that he even (verbally) attacks one guy who tries to help him out from backstage. In his blogpost (when he still was on Myspace) he said that he doesn't remember much from that rant. This happened at a time when he was so used to hecklers that he was in great shape when it comes to dealing with them. He admitted that now that he is more successful, he would have a bit more difficulty (though this is in the eye of the beholder) because most of the audience knows him and his style and he is less paranoid about getting attacked. tl/dr: listen to his podcast and go fuck yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though I am more of a lurker, to say that the last weeks have been a bit exciting for me is quite the understatement. Getting dogecoin into Nascar was a big thing and /u/dogedriver is an amazing ambassador not only for the coin but also for reddit as a whole. Having said that I have to say that I am a bit disappointed at how some fellow shibes here have been acting, especially regarding Danica and critics of Josh. Please be aware that we as a subreddit have taken up a certain responsibility. By standing behind Josh we have basically made him the face of reddit/dogecoin in the Nascar-world. This also means that bad behavior from our side will be reflected upon him. To paraphrase what Terry Pratchett once wrote: If Josh Wise has to sneeze, Dogecoin will blow the nose. While there is lots of unjustified anger towards Dogecoin and Josh, we are not helping him by adding fuel to the fire. This includes dickish behavior and mocking towards Danica and critics of Josh. In an ideal world Josh would get a reliable sponsor and we would sit in the back and yell "That's our shibe!". And a sponsor will think twice before he jumps on board when he thinks that Josh is being backed up by a pack of annoying kids who are being hated by their target demographic. We should be a support, not a liablity. Some say that they respect Danica but shun her because she accepts sponsorship from Godaddy. Do you think that sponsorship is growing on trees? Do you think that she can walk around and pick her sponsors? I don't think so. And as a female driver she will always have the pressure of not being judged as Danica but as a woman. She clearly is a fighter and deserves some respect. This subreddit is know to be laid back and fun. Don't be a dick because you feel you need to celebrate your position as the underdoge, being special and different and all that. Instead try to amaze the critics with your awesomeness, disarm them with your enthusiasm. That's all I wanted to say. TL;DR: Don't be a dick. Be a shibe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried taking pills but with little success. I really would like to know whether one can get accustomed to sailing. Thanks. Edit: Thanks, I guess I should stay on land then. Just to give you a hint of how bad my case is: I get seasick snorkeling. I puked while diving (yes, under water). And I can't even canoe on a lake. :-(</TEXT>

And then I think I'd like to... write... something... I don't remember what." Standing in the corner, he waits. The sand slowly flows, but it nears it's end. The old man still glows, as thousands of threads spread away from him. SQUEAK. I AGREE. IT IS A SHAME TO SEE HIM THIS WAY. SQUEAK. NO. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.... BUT I CANNOT WAIT TO ASK HIM HOW IT ALL ENDS. The old man looks up, through them at first... and then he sees them. For once, the smile on the hooded figure's skull is genuine. "I... I remember you. The anth... ant..." ANTHROPOMORPHIC PERSONIFICATION. "Yes, that. We knew each other?" ONCE. AND WILL AGAIN, SIR. He so rarely said it, and these feelings... remembering his young aprentice, and beloved daughter. The beautiful child they have. "There... is a girl, yes?" SHE IS SPEAKING TO THE AUDITORS, SIR. THEY ARE UNWILLING TO LISTEN. "Well then. You know what they say, two things you cannot avoid. Taxes and..." He looks into the firey blue eyes, and becomes aware. SQUEAK. "Quite right. Is it time already? I have so much left to do." YOU HAVE GIVEN ALL YOU CAN SIR. "No, not cancer. Alzheimers." I AM AWARE. "So, where is the boy? I remember a boy." CARRIAGE ACCIDENT. "Ahh. Never much trusted cars. Or horses." THEY GET YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. "Must I?" SOON. BUT WE MAY SIT HERE AWHILE. SQUEAK DO YOU HAVE ANY BISCUITS? "No. Shame really." YES. "Is it truely turtles?" ALL THE WAY DOWN. I HAVE SEEN THEM. "Ahh. I would love to see it. Perhaps a small trip before?" IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE. "The light is slower there... and there's a monkey...." ORANGUTAN. SAME PRINCIPLE. "Yes... will they remember me?" SQUEAK. "What was that? I could not hear you." HE SAYS WE WILL, SIR. "I never much liked the trouble people had with you. You seem like a nice fellow." I HAVE MY DAYS. "Don't we all?" SOME LESS THAN OTHERS. "Is it quick?" YES. AND I BROUGHT THE SWORD. CEREMONY DICTATES IT. "Ahh. How about a cup of tea?" I WOULD ENJOY IT. DO YOU PLAY CHESS? "No. how about checkers?" And so they sat, two old friends regaling each other, though the old man could not remember all of the details, the cloaked man and his rat filled him in, when it was needed.</TEXT>

" - "If you say anything against refugees in Europe you are burned faster than a Witch in the witch hunts :)" I'd say Reddit at its best. I guess you did the best you can do already, probably upvoted a few Reddit posts talking about [racism](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/search?q=racist amp;restrict_sr=on amp;sort=relevance amp;t=all), along with some motivating retweets, that should be enough, why do more? Right?! You should help people but please do it somewhere else, thank you very much. And if you send fugitives here, could you please just send the white ones? Lovely. I am pretty sure most of you have no idea how it feels like to be chased by a bunch of people who want to curb stomp you and I hope you will never have to go through it. But some of you guys are pretty sick and need help.</TEXT>

I might be too naive but science should be about truth not about how high the impact factor of your next paper is. The Harvard model is a breeding ground for fraud and misconduct.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Question] Is is always so difficult in SF to get a medical appointment?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-31 16:12:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Background: I recently developed an unexpected medical condition which brought me to the ER. The doctor there wrote me a referral for a neurologist and told me to see one as soon as possible. Since then I called more than 10 doctors from the list he gave me and it has been rather frustrating. I have a PPO insurance and the ER doctor's referral. In the best cases they told me that they might have an opening in a month or so, in the worst cases they told me that they are not accepting any new patients. I am very unfamiliar with the US medical system. Could you please tell me if I am doing something wrong or whether this is normal? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately I am not at work so I can't read the paper. Some criticism (purely based on this article!): If it is a breakthrough drug they would not have published in PNAS. They would have gone for Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, PLoS...most likely in that order. BACE inhibitors are nothing new (in terms of breakthrough), their role in Alzheimer's disease is already being studies for a while  gt; The results from the study will soon be trialed in human Alzheimer #8217;s patients with a large-scale clinical trial currently being planned with around 1000 participants that will test a modified form of the BACE inhibitor drug. "Soon"...If they just finished the animal studies there is no way that they will test this in 1000 humans. Companies are currently bending the rules to do 100 patients for a Phase I trial but I doubt that the FDA or EMA would allow a Phase I 1000 patients. Companies have already started testing BACE inhibitors in humans. Merck [had to stop](http://investors.merck.com/news/press-release-details/2017/Merck-Announces-EPOCH-Study-of-Verubecestat-for-the-Treatment-of-People-with-Mild-to-Moderate-Alzheimers-Disease-to-Stop-for-Lack-of-Efficacy/default.aspx#sthash.U27YKUxG.dpuf) it in Phase II because their didn't seem to be any effect. Was a bad day for them business wise. The paper says "contributed by Bert Sakmann". If that mean that he submitted the paper (though Busche is last author). Sakman is a [member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_(Cellular_and_molecular_neuroscience) of the National Academy of Sciences.). "Contributed by" in PNAS speak means that they went with Track I submission. While this means that the paper is still being reviewed, it also means that the submitter gets to choose the reviewers (only two needed in this case). I tend to be extremely critical of papers published this way. We haven't had a breakthrough in Alzheimer's drug for the last 14 years. It would be great if it finally would happen. But articles like this are only raising false hope.</TEXT>

Pretty sure he saw his first foreigner real close. Kind of funny, because we stared the shit out of each other. Not in a "sizing up to see if I can take him" way. More like "Oh...they do exists..." kind of way. But regardless: Dresden is a beautiful city, if you have the chance, visit it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Die Da is the German version of Rappers Delight. It was incredibly popular and opened the path for German rap to the public. But the "serious" German rappers hated it because they thought that it mocked and commercialized what they considered real. Real hiphop heads might disagree but I like to think that without Die Da, we would never had bands like Eins Zwo or Die Beginner. Noteworthy: There were rap groups before Die Da. Many of them very serious, addressing social topics. While Die Da made rap music popular the successful bands had more of a middle class theme, often with humorous takes and not really taking themselves too seriously. Stylewise I would say...maybe Will Smith or style rapping? Gangstastyle rap became popular much later. Before the experts get angry: I am ignoring Torch, Ferris MC, Massive Toene, Advanced Chemistry etc. It would makes things far more difficult. Sorry for that. How tacky were the beginnings? Well: - Der Toby und Das Bo: [Morgen geht die Bombe hoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyzF06ridc) - Fettes Brot: [Jein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcV7VN3l3bY) My favorite German rap songs, the ones I still like to listen to: - Eins Zwo: [Danke, gut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raB1ABsHkCI) - Fuenf Sterne Deluxe: [Dein Herz schlaegt schneller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raB1ABsHkCI) - Fettes Brot: [Nordisch By Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfWyo2mqXnw), spoof of Naughty By Nature - Blumentopf: [Fuck the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIV8HebMfgM) Etc..</TEXT>

Usually I don't fall asleep before 01:00. This is not happening on lifting days. I eat clean during the week and never feel bloated during that time. What would be the reason of this?

The final fight is incredible, just ignore the French dub. [Operation Condor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOy1ncO2t8c): The wind tunnel fight, one of the most hilarious fights I have seen. [Police Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMlG-EVoqFw): The mall fight. [Police Story 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ej-iuKgmvQ): Jackie making fun of traditional Kung Fu fight scenes. [Police Story 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWtpY6EhxXI): The playground fight. [Twin Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_TA7P_LC6o): Separated at birth, these twins sometimes copy each others moves. [Dragons Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TMS5FEIoSs): Jackie's other project with Benny "The Jet" Urquidez. Urquidez is a fucking beast. Part of what makes his scenes so amazing is that he has a dedicated stunt team he has worked with for many years. When you watch a few movies you will notice the same faces over and over. When looking at his older stuff you have to mention Yuen Biao and Samo Hung. Yuen unfortunately never became well know in the Western world, Samo is here mostly know for directing Ip Man. I don't like his American movies, mainly because the fight scenes are horrible edited. Reddit has a huge boner for Rush Hour which I simply don't understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up in Germany. One day, during my first year in high-school, teachers started to run around, yelling at each other to set up the TV: The Berlin Wall had fallen. Some teachers were crying, hugging each other, others went out for a drink to digest what they had witnessed. I vaguely knew that this was a big thing but I had never realized how much the Iron Wall had effected some of the people I knew on a personal level. My most vivid memory of that time is David Hasselhoff standing on the Wall and singing "Looking for Freedom" while people tore down parts of that thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clinical investigators have to register their interventional trials in [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), and for certain, applicable trials they also have to report results. This is supposed to increase transparency and avoid publication bias. The penalties which could be handed out for non\-compliance are pretty hefty. Yet, there hasn't been a single case yet where either FDA or NIH decided to punish a PI. And the Final Rule regarding [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) has been in place for over a year now. When will the NIH start handing out penalties? What is keeping you from doing so? Without a clear threat there will never be an incentive to follow the rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The [Sandler Neuroscience Building](http://www.mccarthycook.com/wp-content/uploads/1-01-6.jpg) in San Francisco. A while ago UCSF thought it would be a great place to lease and use as a flagship location for part of their neuroscience location. It is new, it is sleek, has style....and well, it kind of kills anything which might lead to a collaborative environment. Again, the building has been leased, so it was never intended to be for research. UCSF just decided to use it for it: - no oxygen lines: yeah, once they had refitted the building for research they realized that there was no dedicated oxygen line. Now they have to buy bottles which are at a centralized location, from there the oxygen gets routed to the benches. But haha...not all places which require oxygen are at a bench. So labs are forced to buy their own bottles. Oh, and OSHA often likes to complain that there are workspaces. Also: not a single fucking gas line. If you are doing molecular biology, you need fire to sterilize things. Tadaaaaaa...nobody thought of that. - PI offices are far away from the benches: because obviously it is not a good thing to have the PI nearby for discussions and stuff, so their offices are at the other side of the fucking building. - Some of the lab offices have towards the atrium. The building has a sun roof to use as much natural light as possible. As a result, during noon people with desks at the window can't see shit when they work on their laptops. Because nobody thought it would be a good idea to install shades. - Within a floor the labspaces are so concorted that as a group you rarely see other groups. Nobody really to talk with about your work and toss around ideas. - Their is no common space within the lab area where people could meet and get to know each other. No fucking room with seats and tables where people could hang out. Instead they said: look at this great wide atrium! Just leave your labspace and go there! Well, fuck you: It feels like sitting in a lobby of an office building. How the fuck are people supposed to relax? - You can't hang stuff on the walls of the hallway. It is nice to hang up your research posters on the wall. It allows others to learn a bit about your research while walking around. It allows you to explain things to visitors while having everything on one large surface. Now the hallways look like long, sad cubicles. - Because the building is so cool and sleek, UCSF likes to hold cool and sleek events in the lobby: cocktail receptions and shit. The atrium is so wide and openly designed that you can hear that shit party everywhere. It's like a giant cave. UCSF said that the events only occur after 5. Show me a normal research building where people leave after 5? - After 5, you can't get decent food around the campus that isn't completely overpriced. - I could go on... tl;dr: UCSF has a research building which kills any incentive to be productive and collaborate. Gradstudents and postdocs often have to work long hours to get shit done; as a results it is necessary to have a research location which makes you feel like home because you can't be at home. Fuck UCSF.</TEXT>

Many Turkish soldiers fell during the war, there is even a monument in Busan honoring them, so their role was well known among the war generation. I grew up in a German working class area together with many Turkish immigrants. There was a group of Turkish kids I regularly got into a fight with. Complaining about them at home usually let to lengthy "discussions" about me showing a bit more respect.

    <TEXT>My wife got an email this morning from a former undergrad, asking for a letter of reference. He had worked with her for less than 2 months before quitting. During that time, according to the other undergrads, he had spent most of his time surfing the web or sleeping. Oh, and the deadline for the letter is this coming Monday. Talking about him let us to talk about other undergrads, some which still work with her, some which had left. Somehow we started a list of things we noticed over the years and I thought that it might be worth posting it here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wouldn't say that the lack of experience is a deal breaker. None of our undergrads had any previous practical experience (maybe a course which involved lab work but that was it). The basics of molecular biology are the same, regardless of whether you do immunology, oncology or neuro. At this point I would use the opportunities to figure out whether it is actually something she would enjoy. Basic research can be brutal (see /r/labrats for stories). For neuroscience, apart from lab experience, I would suggest picking up some basic programing experience, it will make life a lot easier down the road. What exactly is she worried about? What are the practical questions she currently has?</TEXT>

Within your regiments, form committees for a free Germany, so we can rebuild our fatherland after the war. GERMAN SOLDIERS!

Needs some context though: The old actor who played Darkwing Duck is desperate to stay relevant after the show got cancelled. After the final fight with the actor he replaced him the team leaves, thinking he died during an explosion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the Youtube description:  gt;This movie was shot by the Lumi #232;res Brothers in July 1896 in London at the Sydenham Crystal Palace park. It is originally described as "Javanese wrestlers", but based on the dress of the two persons involved, it is improbable. Most likely, this video shows two Burmese boxers. They were possibly part of the 1896 India and Ceylon Exhibition, an infamous human zoo.  gt; Some things to keep in mind about this video:  gt;We do not know the nature of the fight being presented. Is it friendly sparring, some sort of practice or demonstration?  gt;We do not know the skill of the boxers. Are they experimented, novices?  gt;While this is quite probably Burmese boxing, it is only one form of it. It is unlikely that only one style or one set of rule existed at this point in time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[BF4] Help: Bullets are not registering</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-12 04:45:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am new to this game, started playing a few weeks ago (PC). I noticed that my bullets rarely seem to do any damage. I can see the splatter, I can hear the impact, but after a few shots the guy turns around and kills me, still with (almost) 100 Hp. I even had this happen when I managed to sneak behind the enemy and literally stood a meter behind him. This is getting quite frustrating. I like playing medic but I can't help when I can't get rid of a shooter. My ping looks fine, usually  lt;70. Is there anything I can do to fix this? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>
