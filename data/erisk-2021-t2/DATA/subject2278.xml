    <TEXT>people keep saying not to and it #8217;s not the first  #8220;unhealthy coping mechanism #8221; I #8217;ve tried and if someone gives me a  #8220;healthy coping mechanism #8221; that works just as well I #8217;m open to suggestions. Also an important note: not everyone does it for the same reason but people get lumped together and so it makes it really difficult to figure out why I #8217;m doing it. (sorry started ranting kinda there) . Point is I #8217;m not going to stop until there #8217;s an equal or better alternative than my unhealthy coping mechanisms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh I hate the freaking dress code. I usually dress very modestly and on picture day last year I wore an off the shoulder shirt- you know like the ones where the sleeves go on your upper arm instead and the neckline is like straight across- and no one cared. Same dress code this year and for picture day I wore the exact same shirt but in blue instead of white and got dress coded. Another time I wore the shirt and several teachers told me they liked my shirt and thought it was cute until one of them said it violated the dress code. It #8217;s entirely based on whatever each teacher feels like doing rather than actual rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Google  #8220;call of the void #8221;. I #8217;m not very good at explaining it, but I #8217;ll use the example of standing on the edge of a cliff. You might have a random thought to jump off, but aren #8217;t suicidal. It #8217;s guessed that this is caused by your brain telling you to be step back, and then realizing that this is irrational as nothing will happen if you just stand in one place, but your brain misinterprets this as wanting to jump. It can be many different ideas- like driving into oncoming traffic, jumping off a cliff, or screaming in a quiet room.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Call of the void is basically when your brain is trying not to do something (fall of a cliff for example, so you take a step back) and then because your brains reaction isn #8217;t necessary (you would have been fine staying in the same place and would not have fallen) so it thinks that your intention was to jump off the cliff originally. Obviously you would know what #8217;s happening better than I do though, and I agree with the idea that it #8217;s fine unless it impacts your life.</TEXT>

Also, idk much about ponds and aquatic plants but maybe a plant that could anchor underwater in the pond but still come out of the water would work to add oxygen? Like lily pads or another floating aquatic plant? It just seems like a cool idea</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh cool :). A little while ago I found a baby robin (and his dead sibling) and nest on the ground, put it up in the tree it was under (though probably the wrong tree bc the nest had been blown by a storm during the night and I hadn #8217;t seen it in that tree before) and left it. It was a very young guy, he only had a few little fuzzy tufts on his head. At least 24 hours passed and I didn #8217;t the parents return, he was probably abandoned, the closest wildlife rehab was a few hours drive away, do you happen to know if I could have done anything to help him?</TEXT>
