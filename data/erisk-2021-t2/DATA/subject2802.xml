    <TEXT>3 months into dating a guy I found out that his Snapchat private pics password is set to his ex's bday and he has a picture of her hidden away. Nothing explicit which makes me wonder why he hid it . He claims that he hasn't changed the password since they broke up 8 months ago . He gets notifications on Instagram every time she posts a picture. Should I be worried about him still having feelings for her? Yesterday,He told me he was thinkig about her and asked what i needed him to be . It feels like he wants to change for her because he regrets losing her and does not care for me. I have brought it up with him but he scolds me calling me insecure and does nothing to comfort me. What do I do! Should I leave him?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone with virgo for an ascendant, id say thats a good thing. He is probably just trying to make sure that you're not a rebound. Its not very wise to get with someone if you havent fully processed the emotional baggage from your last relationship. You gotta remember how it feels to be happy, single and whole on your own before you date someone new. I dated a virgo man once. What stands out for me is the thoughtfulness and his ablolity to think logically even when things got stressful, ya know. Give him time. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow. Thank you for taking the time to give me such a detailed, descriptive answer. I remember reasing somewhere that in order to be loved we have to go through the ordeal of being known and that includes the not so pleasant bits of us. Regarding boundaries, growing up I legit had zero room for personal space thats something that is gonna take getting used to. When you're used to people disrespecting the boundaries you try to set. In ppace you eventually stop trying to set them up, cuz whats the point right? Rudeness, injustice/ hypocrisy make me rage too. . Its hard I'm gonna have to cut down on putting up a front and focus on being real . Like you said, the whole truthfully answering how are you is gonna take a lot of work. And a lot of people just ask out of habit and not genuine concern so why take up time and space lol</TEXT>

I'm sorry you had to go through that.

A quick google search would show u what sign they were in. The only thing that's hard to determine is your ascendant, or thr rising sign cuz that depends on what sign was rising when u were born and changes every hour or so. The rising also maps your first house so it would be difficult (atleast for someone at my noob level of knowledge) to know which planets are in which house</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg. Do u need a hug? Sends one just in case I get the whole reading during recess bit. I'd skip games period to go read in school cuz none of the kids would pick me to be on their team, I'd be the last picked, was shitty at sports and the library was air conditioned. Cut to me at work, a bunch of people asked if i wanted to play for sports day-to-day there were barely any girls playing, but i was just too scared to play cuz i didnt want all of these new people to laugh at me the way peeps back in school did? But like meh. As sports day rolled around i saw that others werent playing that well and i regretted not pushing myself out of the comfort zone. This whole unlearning old behaviours is hard af.. You wont know if u dont try, but it all comes down to how many times you're willing to try :3 Maybe what we really need is a vacation away from civilization, to sit on the beach on a moonlit sky with toes dipped into the water and practice deep breathing or some such Even on the communication front, i feel like i cant talk to people in real time. Like i gotta hear them, looking down preferably, take some time to think without them expecting an answer from me, cuz then I'm bound to say what i think they wanna hear, or just not ask the questions i need to if that nakes sense. Like. Ughh. Written communication is definitely my favorite. Also. I hate feeling obliged to reply. On the family front, that shit sucks. Must have been worse being a guy cuz gender norms around emotional sensitivity. Once u learn how to keep thibgs bottled up is when they start to pry in my experience and that gets mad confusing Would u say u have heavy Plutonian energy in your chart?</TEXT>

That whole bit abt looking at the wall jas me thinking ' fuck talking to people, just do your thing '  #128584; #128584; but thats probably the north node and mercury conjunct in leo in the 12th house. What's your mercury in? As for Plutonian energy, its something i just started reading up on, cuz my 8th house lord0(mars) is in the first. And i have pluto in the third squaring my 12th house (so mercury, venus and north node) This book i downloaded today had some stuff abt family dynamics and repressing your emotions hence the question.

    <TEXT>We sure love our masks, dont we Omg i get so annoyed by people who take up too much space xD it's something i need to work on, learning to just take up space. Keep getting hemmed in from all sides in group photos and i dont like it.. We should totally go grocery store shopping together  #128514; there have been days I've walked in to work, jiving, cuz i had my earphoned plugged in . Singular undivided attention as in romantic interest or interest in general? You dont have to be worried abt me being exhausted with the discussion yet. You sound a lot like me and I'm humble enough to admit that the attention hoe /narc in me likes that xD well written thought out replies are fun to read, like, yes, put some thought into it, dont throw a 'how u doin'at me. I have no idea how to keep those conversations going My last serious relationship, i met the ex at a conference that had us drafting memorandums and what not. What do u mean abt the square? What have i repressed around my family is a long one. Mostly i think way too independently to be told what to do and what not to do, hence, by extension to fit in. It's really hard for me to follow orders if its not in line with my logic, so id be all up in my parents faces, get my ass beat and cry. But id just stick to my side, (cue taurus moon) and make it worse. It was a 'defend your morals /ideas by sticking to them kinda thing' my sister was the one who made nice, i had/have a righteous martyr complex. I have a ton of shitty memories ,sis tells me it wasnt that bad, which drives me mad.A lot of my time was spent thinking, i gotta make a lot of money when im older so i can leave. And ugh, its a lot of shit to unpack in one go Pfft. Still staying with them Cuz its more affordable and the culturally accepted thing to do. I don't quite remember what got me into astrology? I mean i love to read. Sometimes i get this obsession with a game ot topic. Rn, it's astrology. It probably started off as a self help experiment. Western astrology places my Venus in virgo, so i looked it up and one of the videos had me bawling my eyes out. Cuz i just felt so understood. The aim was to uncover and understand shadow sides of the self, but now i feel like im just giving into my baser instincts. So the problem with vedic astrology is, some of the websites have an antiquated attitude to sex and a woman's role in a Relationship (read marriage cuz casual dating is frowned upon) so it just takes longer to figure out stuff. Also, i just find myself relating to a bunch of things, like, i'll nod along to a libra rising and a virgo rising video and be like, ok which one is it. Same with the nodes. What started your journey into astrology ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>12rh house leo with venus and north node hanging in there, amplifying every ibsessionni have. If i have the hots for someone i have to 'HAVE' them. Since its men doing the chasing traditionally, it means it feels ike i have to wait for them to chase to truly value me. But if i wait too long i lose interest. Instabt gratification is my poison of choice. This goes for food, dafes, shopping trips whatevet. I'd rarher have something in the here and now than wait for something better. This mostly applies to food. Microwaved pozza over cooking a 3 course meal. North node in leo implies that my struggle in this life is to be more outgoing and warm. Ibstruggle with approaching people or groups for one on one conversation. My mercury in the 12th gives me a preference for written communication, texting, emails, writing letters/ blogs to communicate over verbally expressing things. I find it easier to write down to express than to vocalise feelings. But that could just be my pluto in the 3rd making communication difficult. I have a flair for dramatic, shocking, impactful language.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm no expert so take this lightly, Rahu amplifies whatever it touches right, and the North node is qwhat you are here to frow into. So it appears that their life purpose is to grow into what your venus appreciates/ finds attractive? It may be an oversimplification though. Their Venus being conjunct your ketu appears a little concerning to me. Sure they're probably attracted to your south node signs traits,this could also mean that you get really comfortable and dont really venture out much of the south node area if expertise. It all comes down to y'all's individual growth and evolution, i suppose</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-08 14:56:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Had a really blown out dream about me being chased and having to take a flight to go escape. There were 5-6 of us. The ddream started with me in class talking to a guy who I knew was good for me. But then a guy who was hot (and someone who wouldn't fulfill my emotional needs) sat next to me and i ignored the other guy cuz he felt simple and i could feel that the nice guy felt ignored? Then we received news that we had to leave. there were 5-6 of us trying to escape. We made it to a house. We hid in an empty house. There was a boy about 4-5, it felt like he was vital to us escaping. There was a girl of 12-13who felt wronged by me, idk why. I knew i hadnt done anything wrong but i wanted to talk to her. To comfort her. A neighbour woman offered us refreshments. I was skeptical but dad said she lived nearby and was more like us than the people chasing us. We made it to the Railway Station where i felt like my dad took something of mine and gave it to strangers girls to keep our cover. We had to split up so the people chasing us (a colleafue from work rhat i hate) wouldnt catch us. Then i got into the flight. surprisingly sooner than expected.the next scene was a beautiful island mountain , with snow on top. TLDR :I'd spent a whole day watching videos on inner child work, escapism,self soothing work. Idk ifthe dream is a cry of help or just my brain adding a cool storyline to the videos i watched. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is legit af. Works the other way round too. Say if I'm completely focussed on my partner's pleasure, my brain has switched to the giving mode, and while that's sexy, it usually means that my lady bits are not getting as much attention cuz I'm trying to focus on the job at hand, which is getting the guy off. Also, if you're focussed on the dom aspect and powerplay it's more of a cerebral pleasure so could be a distraction cuz you're caught up in the storyline ? Heck ,I've been distracted more times than one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Holy shit. So my tropical rising sign is Libra. ( #9804; sun,  #9802;  #127769;)And a lot of western astrologers agree that wanting a relationship or a partnership is a very Libra thing. Maybe the way to find a ride or die is by not compromising on the big deals? The moon and venus battle could make finding the one that fills both those buckets could be daunting, but its gotta be worth it. Or so i hope, for both of us. Sounds like the perfect Relationship when u do find someone like that. What's your venus in? And you're referring to the tropical system right?</TEXT>

Just focus on bwing authentic op, and if that means, digging your nose in pubkoc so do that. And carry a handkerchief. Maybe people who carry a sanitizer will flock to u. See? You've nade friends compatible with your life style. Shitty example? Yeah. But u get the gist. Find 'your'people. To do that u have to do and talk more of the things that make u happy.

    <TEXT>Thank u for responding in such a detailed manner :) I got out of a 3 year long relationship last year. Went on a series of dates and had muktiple month long situationships? I've been told that I have unrealistic/ extremely high expectations from relationships /potential partners and I can be really aggressive in asking foe things rhat i feel like should be a given ina relation. I suppose thats where the difficulty in finding a man bjt comes from? I'm curious about which placemen lead you to that conclusion so i can look it up. Ooh, which bit represwnt s the destined to get a calm, peaceful, loving man? You're spot on with the need to learn to be more gentle with people bit. As for home, we moved a lot for my dad's work. So would home refer to the city my parents are from, whwre i was born,or the one i see as 'home'? I'm thinking of taking up an mba course and doing astrology on the side. Is that something that would count as creative stufies Temperament as in poor anger management? Could u elabprate a little on the skills bit</TEXT>

Its hard for me to believe that someone in love would not want to get something, even if it is as simple as a ten buck key chain. It's the thought that counts and right now op feels like boyfriend doesnt care for her because he doesnt see that this means something to her. It just seems like a sad case of incompatible /different love languages.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. So you're a Scorpio sun. Cancer and scorpio share the same element. So you probably have the same intuiyive tonality. Your ascendant, Capricorn is a sister sign to cancer. Sister signs are usually two sides of the same coin. Say, for example, both value security. Cancer works hard to maintain a stable home to feel secure, Cappys would work hard to progress through the ranks in an organisation. So the common link here would be hard work and a desire for security.</TEXT>

I've been into astrology since last year but i guess the lockdown just forced me to actually read up on it in more depth than before. One thing lead to another and i just stumbled upon The teal swans spiritual videos. Which in turn lead to tarot suggestions . I dont even remember what the first video was. But. Umm, it was definitely after a guy ghosted me. I was mad attached and had this weird trust in him. Pretty shre there was some karmic stuff there from our horoscopes alone. A lot of my tarot readings kept saying starseedAnd here we are now a month latet.</TEXT>
