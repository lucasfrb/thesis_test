    <TEXT>I don't have enough info on the card, but the salesman recommends me to install Windows 7 for the Thunderbolt PCIe card support. I guess it's more about a driver thing. In my google search, I can only find Thunderbolt 3.0 (with USB type-C interface) is supported by recent Linux kernel with implementations by Intel. I am not sure if the Thunderbolt 3.0 controller is actually the same thing as the PCIe card which doesn't seem to have a USB-C port. But thank you for your input!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the SWAP, I think it will be rarely used, and hence may not necessarily follow the traditional way. For the `/home` directory, I have indicated that I am going to use [LVM](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm) system to manage files, which means `/home` will be in a virtual group with partitions like `/dev/sda8`+`/dev/sdb9` spanned on two disks. My question is should I use LVM for all partitions? It is good for expanding "partitions" to more plugin disks, but it may make the system more complicated. Regarding the `/data` directory, I plan to use it as a shared data storage place where every user can write and read data from it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you very much for your insight. It sounds good to also put swap in an LVM virtual group. I haven't thought about that before. Regarding the backup strategy, I haven't figured out a proper way. One difficulty is that we only have 2TB remote wireless/cloud backup disks (I am still negotiating with the manager to purchase a bigger backup cloud disk). So, I was thinking to only backup the `/home` directory on the same machine, and backup the root on the cloud end. I am not sure if I should always use `btrfs` filesystem to make it possible to use fast snapshotting for the best performance, though I have no experience with LxD nor snapshotting. As you have pointed out, if `/home` is on two disks, there is a security problem. It could also generate some performance problems with mismatched SSD and HDD speeds. We prefer to allow all users to run programs on an SSD while storing permanent data on HDD. Maybe I should find a better directory structure to shrink `/home` only on SSD for ~10 current heavy users and make it possible for future SSD expansion. I would like to hear about more on the backup strategy and file structures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those are very good suggestions! One question: do know if I use dd to pipe home and root into gzip or p7zip, is there any way to directly store the compressed files on the HDD without losing performance? This job can be scheduled overnights, but compress files and firstly store them on SSD may take up all my SSD space. It would be nice to have another SSD to solve this problem as you suggested, please allow me to think about the worst scenario if I couldn't get the budget. On the root directory, I am planning to install all commonly shared programs like Matlab, Mathematica, Python, Julia and some other professional programs under the root's username to avoid other users to install them again. Maybe I can shrink root to ~100GB, but 50GB was blown up once in the past. So, the current setting can be: 512GB SSD (`/dev/sda`): `/boot`, LVM-btrfs, 250MB `/swap`, LVM-SWAP, 4GB `/` (root), LVM-btrfs, 100GB `/home`, LVM-btrfs, ~400GB 2TB HDD (`/dev/sdb`): `/backup`, LVM-btrfs, 1TB (for home boot and root) `/data`, LVM-btrfs, 1TB The whole HDD will be backed up on a cloud using a cron script or lvm snapshots for now. I will definitely request for purchasing mirror disks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On my "plan to group partitions", it has two meanings: one is to group partitions on virtual groups using LVM or similar technique to make it easier to expand a group on new SSDs or HDDs; the other meaning is to use btrfs or other filesystems so that I can do fast snapshots maybe over disks or efficient data transformation for backups and so on. Maybe one `/home` directory or virtual group can be distributed on a normal SSD and a PCIe SSD which have different write/read performance. If there is any technique to optimize the data visiting performance over disks, that would be great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Frankly speaking, I don't know how many people is good for a subreddit. Personally, I am lucky to be one of the admin of the largest Quantum Information and Computing (ICIQ) community on Google+ where we have helped people to participate public talks like Q+ and projects. But quickly the community became a place for people to bombard popular science news and some textbook questions when the number of members hit 3000+ threshold. I am also an initializer of a small community called JuliaQuantum where only ~10 of us are working together on open source projects closely and writing papers and codes. This post is my first attempt to let more people to join /r/QuantumInformation. I have been secretly running it for about a year for now--not much of activities--and try to figure out if this subreddit can help people to be more productive or not. If not worth it, I will keep working on research projects and read arXiv papers with a small group of people who I know well. Let me understand how it can work better. In the meantime, the QI subreddit is there for everyone. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>/u/Throwawayof2016, there is no rule here to prevent you from asking questions that have a significant influence on your future life. As a member of /r/QuantumInformation, you can shape its rules by voicing out on the [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumInformation/comments/5de9j8/meta_how_would_you_like_this_subreddit_to_be/) thread. On you concern of the research field, possibly you can find some hints from the [Quantum Information Science wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science). The external links have provided some references to leading research groups and big centers around the world in this field. Contact professors to see if your interests match their research subjects. Although Google, IBM, D-wave and other big companies have been working on this direction, it may be still too early to predict who's going to win a big grand for innovations. A PhD degree might be necessary to be able to conduct theoretical research, and an engineer title might be good for tackling technical jobs. Opportunity is everywhere. Where there is a will, there is a way. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TLP can give me an extra of battery saving. But it really has turned off a lot of stuff. Like my mouse will be unconnected if I don't use it for a while (the time-out setting is 15 seconds I think) and I have to click it when I need to activate it. I can only see ~30% CPU power used but not how many watts. Good news is I can see up to PC3 using TLP versus PC2 without TLP on deep-sleeping status.</TEXT>

So far, dual monitors, TLP and others work fine for me. The only drawback I have noticed is that the PC power saving status went back to PC2 level from PC3 level. Maybe this is temparory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the link, but I had already done all of the initialization settings. I can ping from the server to node1 and vice verse because there are sharing the same `127.0.0.1` address. I have also tried using `qmgr -c 'set node node1 total_threads = 54' to manually set up the thread number, but that didn't change the thread number if I do `pbsnodes` again after restarting the server/mom/sched. I feel this might be related to Torque v6 only because in my search results, no one has the `total_numa_nodes`, `total_sockets` and other parameter controlled by `cgroup` before this version.

If I use `pbs_mom -A node1` to specify the node name as `node1`, then the server will pop out an error as `Node "node1" cannot be created`. Then ``` $ pbsnodes pbsnodes: Server has no node list MSG=node list is empty - check 'server_priv/nodes' file ``` Not sure how to fix it.

    <TEXT>Ok, I think I made a progress. I changed the user to run `pbs` as root by `./torque-setup root`. Then when I specify the `node1` to `pbs_mom` by running `pbs_mom -A node1`, it worked.

    <TEXT>If the program can help clean junk programs in the background, there might be a threshold crossing which the phone can actually save battery life and minimize memory usage as the EMUI 5.0 is claimed to be doing. In the information theorist's perspective, to improve power usage efficiency, the best way is to gather more information from the past so that the works to be done in the future become predictable. Or, in other words, you minimize the possible states/choices in the process of decision making and lower the entropy of the system. That is where the AI comes in. I hope people realize this essential feature in making the core of a system or a system including both machine and men.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From [here](https://club-us.hihonor.com/honor8.32/dual-sim-on-honor-8-.1415): The Honor 8 is Dual SIM stand-by and only work with one SIM at a time. When two SIM cards are inserted, only one SIM card can be set as the 4G/3G/2G SIM. The other SIM card slot only supports 2G networks. You can also configure the default card for mobile data and phone calls according to your monthly plan. If you disable a SIM card, you will be unable to use it to make calls, send messages, or access the Internet. Select Dual SIM calling. You can configure whether you want to select a SIM card manually or use the default SIM card each time you make a call. If you choose to use the default SIM card, your phone will use that SIM card for all outgoing calls. It looks promising, but a later response from a user seems confirming that the Dual SIM version of Honor 8 was not available in the US market except for one on Amazon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For my special case--so to many other people who have similar hand situation, my finger skin will be shrunk if it's in dry-period (means no perspiring, it doesn't matter if I put water onto the skin) and has extra grooves in the fingerprint; in contrast, if my hands are perspiring, there are no such extra grooves in the fingerprint. So, it's not about dirt or grease, the problem is about the extra features a fingerprint can have in different situations. Whether I wet/clean my fingers, the fingerprints are still fundamentally different in different time periods. My current solution is to register different fingers to use in those different periods of time--one for the perspiring period, one for the dry time. I wonder since if I scan one finger over the different periods of time to register those fingerprints as different IDs, the phone seems able to recognize them being for the same finger and refuse for me to register a second fingerprint for the same finger, why it cannot recognize me if I scan the same finger yet at different periods of time? Or, why it doesn't allow me to add more fingerprint features/versions for the same finger ID? I hope this is a direction that Huawei engineers can consider to implement for the future releases to make the phone more convenient to use. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it sparks every single time I plug it to the charger and back to the circuit. Maybe it's not as bright as your case, but my plug's plastic shell has become black. I can only suppress the spark if I plug the charger on the wall socket before connecting to the battery, which yields a lower voltage difference. If you want to double check, could you test if your circuit part has a high resistance? Otherwise, there might be a problem with your circuit on the controller part (not the battery part).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If any Huawei people are watching this thread, please fix or investigate on this issue! T-mobile people said that is a problem with the phone set. The phone signal in the United States could be really weak as people are spreading all over the continent. Without the relay from wifi networks, my phone battery will be draining really fast without getting any phone signal. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On #1, should it be generalized to have a Huawei/Honor/EMUI Store for apps also? I have noticed the Huawei Health and a few other Huawei apps are not available on the Android store, and from other sources it seems new versions have been made while the installed version doesn't receive the update notification. I guess this might require a cloud server in different countries so that HiCloud and online backup and App downloading could become possible. Please try to make it work. Besides, it might be nice to have a cyber space for developers as well. Bug tracking and feature developing is not easy to track on a forum or things like reddit. But this might mean to have at least some part of the EMUI code open to the public. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both are using optical recognition functions. One can automatically recognize a word/phrase taken by the camera, box it and translate it to many other languages if you select. The other one is to recognize an object (like a flower of the kind you don't know about) and shows the name to you. They are pretty accurate so far! If you don't have those functions on your phone by default, please share this info and ask Honor representatives in your region to release those plugins for your models!

    <TEXT>I think you don't understand what people are saying. The EMUI 5 is based on Android 7 yet with an optimized kernel and builtin AI algorithms which are used to learn usage patterns. This is built in even without doing the battery setting to block some apps running in the background. You may find the posts on [this thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/honor-8/how-to/update-to-fix-battery-drain-nougat-t3553054/page16) (starting from the linked page and on) helpful to see what people have found in real live usages. You will find from the reports by a lot of people that after a period of "learning" by the phone, the battery drain pattern is changing and optimized to a longer battery life. Please read the linked thread before your next post. Thanks. PS: Huawei made good phones, but they are not doing a good job in telling the international community how to best use of their phones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not yet available on L04 models (including those sold in US and Canada, to my knowledge). Have those L04 phones already included this patch in the last B360 (EMUI 5.0) upgrade? The Chinese model seems to have [this similar update](http://club.huawei.com/thread-12210807-1-1.html) as B376 coming as well. The L09 model apparently became B380 after this update, and hence I guess L04 model should wait for this patch to come soon?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on your Distribution and Thinkpad model. I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, rolling the HWE version and hence got 4.8 kernel. It's stable and working well for me, although I couldn't reach PC-7 state as others have observed on other Thinkpad models. I have tried 4.9.*, no improvement for me while with a lot of crashes. I suspect 4.10 or newer kernel will crash my Linux apps more often. Fedora might be a better choice for trying newer kernels. Maybe you should just try them out by yourself to see the pros and crons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I have noticed a higher battery drain after Google released the new location sharing on my devices. Google uses a lot of battery if you enable the "body sensor" permission. But if I disable it, I cannot use Android pay. So, I have to enable it before I use Android pay and disable it at other times. I am not sure if the location sharing update affects the battery as much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I strongly agree with your thought on the Android layer development which could be a key to lever the balance. I also see there is a strong drive in terms of profits--how the profit drives companies to make decisions. If the collaboration between Canonical and Google is true, that might be a reason why Canonical gave up on competing with Google completely. As stated by Canonical people, they are putting money on what can bring more money back to them. In the end, reality is real. Maybe let companies develop Android-variances, like EMUI, MiUI, OxygenOS etc is a good strategy to "better the evil" and lead to another more innovative and better OS in the end. I have seen EMUI has gotten some AI built at the root of the OS to optimize battery performance and job management. I am open on those approaches as well. Anyway, tears on those who have been trying their best to tell people "Ubuntu Phones are not dead" along the way in the past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have gone over this as described in my linked ubuntuforum thread. So far, no luck. At least not a trivial task for me. One difficulty is that if I flag the partition as /boot, then it will automatically flag it as ESP. Since the /boot/efi partition has already been flagged as ESP on the same disk, I was told that this makes the Boot Repair tool unreliable for me. In reality, the Boot Repair tool didn't do anything except for telling me "please close all package managers" while I don't have any package manager programming running in the process. You can find all other trials I have gone over in the past days [here](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2358394 amp;p=13632665#post13632665). Thank you for your input, though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I put this little life into a water jar about a month ago before it germinated. Cleaned about 1 1/2 inch of the base part and then covered it with honey in the hope to make it easy to root out. Later on, I added some micro nutritious for plants into the water, but no root has grown yet. Then now I noticed that the base part under water becomes a little dark as didn't change the water as often as per day, and the bud on the surface of water died and became black. Another bud in a higher place withered and dried out. Only left one bud growing leaves which also looks dry after I removed the first bunch of flowers. Is that possible to save it? Did I put too much or too little water, or I should cut the lower part completely and try again? Appreciate your comments!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's more about usage pattern of your own. From my understanding, the machine learning algorithm which is used to optimize the battery performance is built on learning your usage pattern. If you use it in a particular pattern, then you will get a pretty good long battery. Otherwise, it's worse as the phone is constantly learning new and non-consistent patterns. My phone can last very long at the beginning. At least there is 0% battery loss at night when I go to bed regularly. Recently, I was doing conferences and traveling, and hence my phone usage pattern was disturbed. Then the battery life went down dramatically. It will consume a lot of battery at nights, at least. Sometimes, more than 10% of battery drain a night.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think I need any of those deep device diagnostics and low-level accesses. Either T-Mobile app offers an option to disable those features without my permission, or I don't install the app at all. The only info I care about from the app should be able to achieve by simply retrieving info from T-Mobile servers, I think. Sorry. I think the anti-virus software is right about flagging the risks from what you have described. Thank you anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for providing more details. One thing the app should really work for me is the Check Account and Refill function. It only worked once after one of the last updates since I installed the app, the most recent update as I have tried didn't work on my phone. I don't understand why the other functions cannot be separated on another app as they require low-level access and can be replaced by other apps or not as important as the thing customers want from the app. I have T-Mobile's separated Visual VoiceMail app without any problem which could go with the Check Account and Refill function as one app accessible without internet, I hope. I do care about the coverage, but last time when I reported bad connections in my house to CSRs they told me the nearest tower was under maintenance after which I've never seen the situation got improved. I will remain the T-Mobile app uninstalled until I see any further improvements for a reasonable usefulness and security. Most importantly, No offense, T-mobile may need to make a little change at the heart. Just my 2cent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For new models, you wouldn't recommend buying a second-hand computer. If a person put a new model computer on eBay or somewhere, it is suspicious that the computer may have some defects that their warranty doesn't cover or the computer is not very stable but hard to report to Lenovo for the warranty. For old computers, the most common problems on eBay stuff are the cooling issues or scratches which can be easily fixed and hence you can get a pretty good deal for them. So, for your case, I'd look at either the outlet.lenovo.com website or find other perks/discounts. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the past months, I have figured out a way to automate YouTube videos posting, and Reddit has ways to schedule other auto-content postings. I'd like to integrate our previous [ICIQ](https://iciq.github.io) efforts which are mainly focusing on open-source projects and self-organized small group studies for quantum information science (see our branch in [JuliaQuantum](https://juliaquantum.github.io) organization as well) smoothly landing onto Reddit. I am not sure if this will succeed, but once it works, I am happy to move those open-source programs and databases onto /r/physics and /r/quantum or any other academic-focused platforms if the mods there have open minds and would like to share the financial burden of running cloud computing services in a long run. Forgive me, as I don't want to say this too loud, as I am just a busy graduate student who has more failures than successes and is going to graduate soon for an uncertain future. As you can see from my previous surveys and my open-science initiatives, I am open to listent to the community on how we can use all those tools to facilitate research and advance science in a broad sense, and take some collective actions from the community and for the community (I think I am not qualified to speak for all and make a concrete plan). Thank you for following up. I remember our interactions in the old days :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your input. I am indeed looking for quotes on the topic. The given ones are definitely bad examples for this sub for sure--to let people think of better ones. So, I think I have to go on the way of "from the people and to the people". It is initially aiming at inspiring people by those who got inspired in doing QI. Better ideas along this line for minimal efforts? If members are not interested in sharing the simple ideas/truth/sayings leading them to the "Aha" moments and no one cares about being inspired from others' recognization, I am more than happy to turn this feature off, as I will not need to put any further efforts. One personal example is when I finally realized that treating atoms as static objects and light as a moving object is equivalent to treating photons as static objects while atoms moving, it then became trivial to understand atom-light interactions and quantum circuit/network diagrams in various approaches as I did in my recent research. Hopefully, you can see my point of this thread here. As I said elsewhere, I haven't been watching any TV shows for about ten years, and this subreddit is not for those for sure. Hopefully, the highlighted keywords ***random quotes*** in my thread make sense to you now. If you can provide one and other members like it, the quote will be under your reddit or real name if provided as rewards. The proposed goal is to bring in more short and powerful inspiring sentences and intra-personal interactions among community members. Those realizations usually happen in the process of doing things and could be helpful for others as well, yet may not appear on journal papers or final products.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have tried using the DP port and the USB 3.0 port for my external monitor. Both work on XFCE and GNOME environments. The external monitor always requires the discrete GPUs in my limited experience to make it work properly (there were occasional flickering screens when I turned the discrete GPU off). I am waiting for Wayland tech to be mature, but other than that I haven't used any fancy software to make it work. I haven't encountered your problem, but have you checked the display setting to turn off the stretched display? I have heard from people the Bumblebee makes NVidia Optimus work smoothly, maybe worth trying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for thinking forward. To my mind, this is not a zero-sum game, the goal is not just increasing people in our audience and your question is not a concern for us. People who subscribe to /r/LinuxOnThinkpads will also be encouraged to subscribe to /r/Linux, /r/Thinkpad and such (see our sidebar links). As a founder of the new sub and an open-source coder, my initial goal is to organize the human resources to work on productive projects which include [ThinkWiki](https://thinkwiki.org) and open-source projects like [validity90 and others listed but not limited to our wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/wiki/index). I have set up bots dedicated to automatically forwarding messages from ThinkWiki's monthly updates and many open-source projects to the concentrated LinuxOnThinkpads sub. I don't want to forward those messages to /r/thinkpad or /r/linux , because they will be quickly buried in the vast amount of unrelated posts and may get me problems. For newbie questions, we will prefer to have them asked in the [dedicated friendly discussion post mostly in one place](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/comments/6mmh78/yearly_rlinuxonthinkpads_friendly_discussion/). Those could scatter our developers' attentions, but if people would like to offer a hand to newbies, they can do it anywhere. We welcome people share they and verify their experiences using Linux on Thinkpads, good knowledge will be collected to ThinkWiki, issues will be emphasized to developers for their future work. We let developers and experienced users talk to each other easily and see the problems easily. I also set up a bot to automatically forward discussions from the [official Lenovo Linux forum](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/bd-p/Special_Interest_Linux) to guide people not to forget we have the official place to discuss Thinkpad and Linux problems so that questions will not be scattered all over the internet. By concentrating useful resources and the correct people in a concentrated place, I hope this can help boost the Linux development on solving emerging problems efficiently and document them timely. I think the function and goal of starting the /r/LinuxOnThinkpads sub are very clear and distinguishing from other subs. We are not competing with any other subs, in fact, I have sent out a few invitations to mods from related subs to ask if they would like to participate the moderation works on LinuxOnThinkpads and bring back the experiences we have to their own subs for a productive and well-organized community as a whole. If you would like to help around and share the same vision with me, I'd happy to let you mod the sub as well. I am open to your advice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Selfless dedication to serving the community is selfless! This new sub is brought to you by open-source developers and Thinkpad users. Not for profit, not for fake news, not for wasting everyone's time, not for awaiting people's inputs. We have developed a mechanism to actively and automatically push state-of-art content including free software news, open-access tools, posts/comments from well-known and related subs including /r/linux (Yeah, it's even linked on the sidebar), /r/thinkpad and many related websites to our members. We hope, from one place, members can find rich content and can also filter out the content of need efficiently. All topics are picked up by members and open to the community freely and forever. We are grateful to the selfless developers to dedicate their time and program and make this happen. Why do we do that? The goal is to work closely with developers and users all together to build a complete and user-friendly Linux and hardware ecosystem stronger than ever, and help newbies not to give up on Linux. I saw OP has a Thinkpad computer and hence I posted my present here. I hope the initiative of this new sub will benefit serious linux and thinkpad users, newbies in the field and eventually the society. It is a celebration!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The new sub is about Quantum Information science, specifically. We linked on the sidebar and has been automatically forwarding posts from /r/Quantum to /r/QuantumInformation if the post is on Quantum Information. The /u/iciq is a bot we have developed based machine learning algorithms and so on to automatically search on the internet and recommend articles and popular posts to /r/QuantumInformation. It works 24 hours 7 days per week for the community for high quality articles, open-source software news and posts that hopefully facilitate researchers and starters on their serious studies. It has also been forwarding weekly discussion threads from /r/QuantumComputing and AMA from /r/Science to the sub for people to people to discuss hot topics in live. Because /u/iciq has been posting a lot of posts, you might not see others' posts on the front page, but there are posts from others. You can filter out posts in different categories for your specific interest. I hope this new sub will benefit people interested in Quantum Information subject. We appreciate developers from the [ICIQ community](https://iciq.github.io) to make this happen. If you are interested in participating the moderations, let me know. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We could also have two themes for people to switch on and off (as the day and night modes). But this approach is more involved on the coding side. As the [CSS system is fading away](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/) from Reddit site-wide soon, I opted our subreddit in the alpha testing group if Reddit people approve us. We can try, discuss and give feedback on different styles until things settle down along the new feature development phase. So, using the /r/Thinkpad's theme as the default and then a dark theme as optional? Or, just one preferred theme for now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the tricks! I have just updated the dark theme with a shorter version. I think the major issues were caused by the overlap between the default light theme and the modified dark theme, since I am using two themes. If the dark doesn't define the style elements that have been defined in the light theme, things will be terrible. But those elements are hard to identify. For instance, if you look at my current dark theme at https://dk.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpad/, you will find the top position of the post entries are not below the header image (I have used margin-top:200px for entries for them to be visible) which I haven't figured out how to fix it yet...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the writing as a newbi. 1. GNU Linux was invented for people want free-of-charge stuff and for people who want to make a change. If there is no Linux, possibly Microsoft and MacOS would do whatever they want to make money without caring what users want. With Linux, anyone who really care about OS's and software, can voice out by programming on the open-source platform. As a competitor, Linux forces those big companies to innovate and take the good things people have contributed to the community free of charge. As a researcher who is working on quantum information, I also get a chance to examine some ideas for the next generation of computers, which is believed to be Quantum Computer. Without Linux, I don't even know how to start an OS from the scratch. Should Linux people recommend Linux to the Thinkpad community? Yes, we do! Every Linux users are all started as a newbi. If we don't even have a chance to try it out, how can we become a Linux expert and make a distinguished contribution back to the community? By judge on your own after trying it given the time you have for your life. 2. About Thinkpad VS MacBook. Clearly, as you know Thinkpad is ***For Those Who Do***. If you want a nice screen or other aspects, through money at Apple or other companies. If you want to save money and want to upgrade your computers year after year on your own, Thinkpad is designed for this purpose. Just my 2cent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The main purpose of crossposting is to centralize information so that distributed information can be easily tracked and collected to wiki pages; also we can reach out to other subs for people to contribute to our knowledge base and software development here. I have thought of the disadvantage of this approach, and designed the tagging system as you can see. There are both ***Discussion*** and ***Question*** flairs meaning for the same thing, while all crossposted posts have been automatically asigned the ***Discussion*** flair. If you put a ***Question*** flair for your own genuine posts here as an author, or click the ***Question*** tag on the sidebar and filter out posts in this category as a reader, you will be able to avoid the disadvantage of the crossposting mechanism. We don't care where do you post your threads. In fact, anyone can do the crossposting beside the bot I have. I am open to better idea that can replace this design yet is still able to achieve the goals: 1. Centralize information related to the topic of this sub while respect the fact that people will be posting all over the reddit subreddits. 2. Reaching out to other related subs so that our sub can grow to make contributions to the knowledge and software ecosystem growth. This sub is still too small to work on bigger projects. I personally wish every topic on Linux  amp; Thinkpad will be posted here so that we don't need to x-post from other subs, but the reality is still far from the ideal. 3. Save people's time if they want to post threads both here and elsewhere. Thanks for voicing it up and letting me make things clear which has been written in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/wiki/). This issue has also been discussed in the Top-1 [sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/comments/6mk9gk/meta_do_you_have_any_linuxonthinkpadsrelated/) in the early days of creating this sub. Certainly, I appreciate it if you can suggest a better tag name for the crossposted topics as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is totally against the initial purpose of starting this sub. I appreciate you write this long comment up. Please give the mod team some time to give a decisive response. I am also calling up other moderators of this sub to think carefully about why do we have this sub. A short version of my thought is that we shouldn't draw a clear border between /r/Thinkpad, /r/LinuxOnThinkpads, /r/Linux and other related subs--because the Linux and Thinkpad users community are wee-larger than this small subreddit. Instead, we should still encourage Thinkpad and Linux users to post their questions on /r/Thinkpad, the official Lenovo forum or places wherever there have more audience, supporters and directly responsible people (designers and manufacturers) for future improvements of devices/software supports. For the reality that our sub is just starting and we don't have the best experts to answer every question at this stage (we may have in the future); also, we want Linux users to engage with Windows amp;Thinkpad users to let them know that Thinkpad is very good for Linux if they are interested to try out; we want Thinkpad users to engage with Linux users to let them know that among all hardware available, Thinkpad has a big community to make Linux work well. Limiting Thinkpad and Linux users only post on this sub and not other subs and draw a clear boundary is clearly against our philosophy in creating this sub. What I thought we should do in this sub? I thought we should index the related posts with keywords "Linux" and "Thinkpad" so that people who has knowledge to help around to help people in the correct places (can be anywhere); to have software developers and volunteers to see a big picture with an information hub to focus on building a wiki/knowledge base and work on open-source software. All of these will strengthen the ecosystem relatively easier compared to the way that we only look at the posts by a relatively small group of people posting in one place and a place separated from other crossing communities with borders, while valuable information may have existed in a lot of places. I understand there are disadvantages of this approach, that is why are working on Machine Learning based bots and other techniques to make things work. I heartfully encourage people to post elsewhere, as long as you have the correct keywords in your titles and posts, our bots will be able to bring your content here. The votes can be counted elsewhere--doesn't have to be here. Maybe we can call all x-posted posts as "x-post" if you don't care what people posted elsewhere. But do you really not care about x-posted information? If you want to only talk to people in this sub, post it here and use a distinguished flair. This should work on Mobiles, right? One day when this sub grow big enough and most Linux  amp; Thinkpad users post their threads here, you will see a lot of posts almost as many as you see the sum of posts from /r/Thinkpad, /r/Linux regarding Thinkpads and Linux. Do you treat those posts as spamming us? Maybe I am wrong about how can this sub be helpful to enhance the ecosystem and reaching out Linux and Thinkpad to more people, but please also be with me and other members to think deeply and comprehensively about what is the best thing to do for our community in using this subreddit, not just for the sake of this sub. The sub should be made to serve for the continuous growth of the community not for other purposes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the following fact (at least), we may not be able to remove the X-posting function from this sub, but we can figure out ways to solve the problems if related. Again, please allow some time for the mod team to discuss it carefully. This is the subscription and pageview number growth in the past months (extracted from the backbone data of Reddit): http://imgur.com/w8LmqNE As you can see, although this sub has been created in April and has been linked elsewhere on the internet, this sub only has 6 subscribers and less than 100 pageviews in April, zero subscribers and a few pageviews in May and June. It only takes off in the mid of July that is when I announced this sub to /r/thinkpad people and enabled the x-posting feature of this sub. In July, here is the detailed growth statistics table by day--1 day after making some big changes: http://imgur.com/V6femYE As you can see, not only it takes off, but there is a relatively stable subscription growth day by day. Technically, I did a lot of things to let it grow continuously. One important factor I cannot rule out is that this sub starts crossposting from other related subs when the bot automatically reminds people in those subs that there is a sub called /r/LinuxOnThinkpads forwarding their posts. As a counter-example, /r/LinuxOnLaptops started much earlier than our sub, whose creator is also a mod of this sub and defines the same set of rules for us; /r/LinuxOnLaptops has a bigger topic coverage scope and also got the help of the creator of /r/Thinkpad. But it simply didn't take off as we do (not as many of subscribers, at least). Tell me, if we had removed the crossposting function could we get "enough users" given the fact mentioned earlier? If the sub cannot recruit a decent amount of people, how can we get enough content/votes/discussions? If not enough content and people, how can we organize wiki writing, open-source projects and the sustainable growth of the ecosystem of the community? As you can see from the past records, our mod team has been working very hard to satisfy every single request from the subscribers. No one in the team is paid or running the sub for profit. We all have better things to do in our lives. The mod team is now still discussing the issue very seriously. Please be patient and wait for a further discussion on a solution without "throwing out the baby with the bath water". If you have time, please try out the filters just updated on the sidebar to filter out all x-posted posts. More potential solutions will be tested, carefully discussed and coming. Once again, constructive discussions are always welcome. Unsubscribing and ranting ***do not*** solve this issue but are rather more about disrespect to the efforts people have put into this sub.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A simple question: ***would you like to be a mod of the LinuxOnThinkpad sub if no bot x-posting is allowed?*** I appreciate your passions on the continuous development of the Linux  amp; Thinkpad subreddit. I understand if you say No given your time and life style. But I feel you can do a good job given the prompt responses above. This question/request is also open to all other people on Reddit, of course. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I strongly suspect you may need to clean the fan, given this problem happens on both Windows and Ubuntu. This may be the main cause. On Ubuntu, I found GNome is particularly resource-hungry. So, using XCfe desktop environment saved my life. Chrome is also CPU-hungry as well. Better to look at what exactly uses a high fraction of CPU power. Besides, have you tried a newer kernel? BTW, you don't need to use "xpost" on your title. A flair of your post may help you target at correct audience.</TEXT>

Large memory is good for VMs which you might use a lot. If you don't mind not using pens, T470p is also good. If you really need a quad-core and very powerful machine, the P51 line is also good (I have P50 with pen support and touch screen), but it's heavier as you know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The question is about what models of Thinkpads are to release in IFA, Sep 1-6. There are usually at least two release cycles, IFA in Sep and CES in Jan/Feb each year. I guess Thinkpad 260 line needs to be refreshed according to previous release records. I am not sure about other lines. Usually, Lenovo is pretty good on catching up with new CPUs. Microsoft is still using 6th gen of CPUs on their surface nowadays. Apple is usually refreshing their models in May which is 8 months later from the Intel upgrades. By the beginning of next year, it seems all Thinkpad models will be refreshed to the 8th CPUs from previous news briefs of Lenovo. It might be too early to speculate the P-lines, because Intel hasn't announced their HQ or H-lines of CPU models of refresh. What is your guess of Thinkpad release schedule in any case?</TEXT>

Our community developers and content creators are happy to use the centralized content in this super-subreddit for creating new content for people in the Linux On Thinkpad community and spreading them elsewhere without a border.

    <TEXT>/r/LinuxOnThinkpad is the place for discussions without any X-posts and you can also use filters to focus on some topics, but as you can see, not many people want to post there even it is stated in the Sidebar statement that every post there will be automatically forwarded to this sub so as not to lose any audience. This solution is a compromise to people who want to only discuss things in a small sub, people who want to spread the word to a broader community and people who want to centralize information in one place.

    <TEXT>The central information of those referenced discussions is about satisfying as many needs as possible using current techniques. The discussions in the forwarded posts has a background that they are written in the process of solving the problem and satisfying the needs from all parties, and that is why there are people disagreeing some points while the full solution is not yet mature. However, after discussions in a large scale and investigating what people really want, the current system is a balance and nearly complete satisfactions to absolutely most of the needs we have noticed in this community. As I have discussed in related posts, there are people who want to only discuss things in a small sub and hence we have /r/LinuxOnThinkpad (whether people use it is another story), there are people who want to spread the word about their experiences of running Linux On Thinkpads to a broader community and hence we encourage people to post and comment on bigger subreddits like /r/Linux, /r/Thinkpads, /r/LinuxHardware and so on, and there are also many people who want to read centralized information in one place without going through many places and hence we automatically forward those related posts from other places back here at /r/LinuxOnThinkpads. If you just want to satisfy your need and turn off all crossing-posting in all our Linux On Thinkpads subreddit system, you are just ignoring the needs from other people in the community. In the process of starting this sub, we have sent out invitations to a lot of software developers, Lenovo staff and people behind ThinkWiki.org, I don't want to ask everyone's permission to show their responses and their names in public. With the time, I'd rather write something on the [wiki page of this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/wiki/). But without receiving enough positive responses and constructive great ideas, I wouldn't be confident enough to put my time here trying to put some efforts to strengthen the ecosystem of the LinuxOnThinkpads community--including knowledge in the public domain and open-source software. This is the initial motivation of creating this sub and shouldn't be changed as I have promised to those who are really creating content, knowledge and tools to the community and making positive changes. Just my 2cent. Feel free to criticize and make constructive contributions to the future of the community. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand you just want to forbid cross-posting in all subs. But when the sub was initially started, this is the key feature many of the developers and people who would like to contribute to ThinkWiki asked me to have in the sub system. We indeed have created a sub for no-cross-posting. Could you just post there and don't turn other people off? I personally encourage you to also post your wonderful feelings about running Linux On Thinkpads on /r/Thinkpads, /r/Linux and elsewhere, so that more people from outside of the dedicated LinuxOnThinkpads sub can benefit more from your active contributions. We are really just volunteers trying to satisfy as many crucial needs from the community as we can. As you can see, all the mods of the sub have been dedicating their time to make all things possible and all needs considered. With all the current platform settings and the limited time we have, you are welcome to provide constructive contributions other rather ignoring the considerations of other members. Whether or not you want to post on /r/LinuxOnThinkpad which is satisfying your requirements of no-cross-posting to my understand is entirely your choice. Let's conclude this topic and move on. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>/u/Reddit4it and /u/2503DockDude, Please admit the fact that TotesMessenger has nothing to do with this subreddit. I don't know where it comes from, and what we can do with it. Nobody in the mod team of this subreddit has created it, to my knowledge. Please find the creator and complain there. We definitely welcome constructive suggestions on building this sub to be excellent, but this type of complain is out of our reach, and it neither respects the postive efforts of all contributors--for example, the collective [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpads/wiki) knowledge base for recent Thinkpad models and Linux distributions. Thank you for your understanding. This sub has connected to numerous Thinkpad developers (hardware and software), wiki writers, bloggers and many people who are working hard to learn what people need across the world and take real actions to help strengthen the ecosystem of LinuxOnThinkpads. If you don't like to read the cross-posted topics which other people care about and don't want to help people around for the problems having been forwarded here which many others would like to do, please unsubscribe or go to /r/LinuxOnThinkpad where cross-posting is not allowed.

    <TEXT>This FCU doesn't install on my Thinkpad P50 Windows 10 OS! **Description**: I got the update from the Windows Update automatically today. After it said the os is ready to install the update and was waiting for me to restart, I restarted the OS and then it stuck at the booting screen (the blue window showing up). Nothing happened for a long time, and then I have to hard reboot the OS which turned out nothing got installed on my OS. I should have enough space on the C partition (25~28GB available space, compressed, of course). **Reproduction**: Maybe just for my computer. Otherwise, just install the update from Windows Update. **Frequency**: Always for me. Tried three times already. **Video / Screenshot**: NA. **System Specifications**: Everything is updated. Thinkpad P50 mobile workstation. **Misc**: The error message from the `Setuperr.log` has the following content: ``` 2017-10-18 14:28:57, Error SP CSetupPlatformOSSwitchCheckpoint::Rollback: Folder "C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\NewOS" cannot be removed.[gle=0x00000020] 2017-10-18 14:28:57, Error SP CSetupPlatformOSSwitchCheckpoint::Rollback: Failed to read the rollback GUID from file: C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Rollback\rollbackinfo.ini.

It's caused by the fact that I have Ubuntu dual-booted along side with Windows 10, and the bootloader is GRUB. I hope Microsoft developers can fix this issue and make dual-booted systems easier to use Windows! So far, I haven't figured out a way to fix it beside deleting Ubuntu. Thanks!</TEXT>

In my area, there are a lot of thefts while parking bikes outdoor is inevitable sometimes. The controller was installed in the middle and has already taken some space, which I haven't found another location to reinstall it...

    <TEXT>I used to unplug the battery and take away the pannier with the battery pack when I park my bike. This was the way to prevent thefts for me. Anyway, [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/52606482@N08/24016767428) is my current stage--reorganizing the battery pack and the controller. The front part of the bike definitely feels heavier than before. The controller doesn't seem fitting well with the handlebar shaft so I put some thin foam paper between the velcro and the iron shaft to reduce the friction in-between them when turning the handlebar. Things Left to do: 1. Find a better way to put/mount my U-locker (I may still need a pannier bag?). 2. Fix the triangle battery bag's position with some casting bandages? What do you think? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found two nylon belts. So, [I tied up the battery with them vertically and horizontally with the top and down tubes. The crossing point is tied up with the bottle holder](https://www.flickr.com/photos/52606482@N08/37844498656/in/album-72157674344911140/). It feels sturdy enough for me. The velcros I use have been tied up very tightly on the frame and are not easy to detach for now. Maybe I will just make it harder to detach the battery from the frame with some wraps using the versatackle technique you shared :) It's an excellent idea to fix the controller with sticks. I will do it later. I put my heavy-duty U-locker in my previous pannier bag (using the outer pocket which is not broken) in case I still need to use the pannier to carry some personal items on the ride. I may buy a better trunk pannier like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/RockBros-Waterproof-Capacity-Traveling-Mountain/dp/B072L4F6D7/ref=pd_sim_468_1?_encoding=UTF8 amp;refRID=EVPTZHY15HFKMFXVRG5W) if the bag breaks again. I will also need to stick the wires under some duck taps and polish some rough edges, but the bike looks in a good shape for now. I really appreciate all your inputs! Have a good one!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi u/ChrisC_msft, I think this is [this issue](https://communities.intel.com/thread/116427?start=60 amp;tstart=0) with Intel Graphics driver. Before I upgraded to FCU, I can solve this issue by rolling back to an earlier version of Intel Graphics driver. But after the FCU, Windows forced me to use the current version of Intel driver. No matter how I trying to install an earlier version, it always went back to the newer one. Can you change this driver updating policy, and even better--work with Intel to solve this issue from root?

    <TEXT>Thank you for the contributions from /u/smclt30p and /u/iciq! As a small community, we should work together to make things easier! Yeah, I think the gitter chat channel is not a bad idea. One of our supporting project on [fingerprint readers](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90) is having vivid chats on the channel. People with different models can easily provide test results from there. /u/smclt30p I noticed that your project is making a library for xrandr. Currently, the redshift or nightmode management software cannot work on external monitors if they are connected with DisplayLink or other dock stations. From I understand, the xrandr on linux is very limited to the docks. If you can fix this issue at some point, that would be great! BTW, I have set up an automatic monitor on your github repo so that once you release your library on the release channel, there will be a post on /r/LinuxOnThinkpad to inform users and developers in the sub. Hopefully more people will be joining your lead!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I may be wrong, but my attitude towards this issue is you may have been worried too much about it. I would decide the balance between the good side and bad side. Reformating the hard disc and reinstall the OS's would be my maximum operations to apply after receiving the machine. If there is any criminal issues happen in the future, you know who sell you the machine from the shipping address and eBay account, you can ask the policy to check your machine with the default setting to see if anyone did anything bad to you on the computer. If you worry about bloatware, you are not alone. Other people will do things for you if they find the culprit and report to the authority. Keep things simple and easy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to say, people in /r/LinuxOnThinkpad have nothing to do with the /u/TotesMessenger bot. We and many many /r/Thinkpad users have already reported to reddit who has claimed to take action on the bot a while ago, but nothing really worked. I guess the problem is their algorithm has difficulties to turn off the filter at one place without affecting another place. So, either someone try reporting to reddit people again, or learn to mentally ignore the bot. Sorry, I couldn't help much on this issue.</TEXT>

Two subs play different roles. If you read the sidebar further as well as the [wiki page](/r/LinuxOnThinkpad/wiki/index), you will find the philosophy of the subs is not building walls across subreddit and attracting Linux Thinkpad people only discussing related things in a closed subreddit; rather the philosophy of those subs is to encourage experts and capable people to reach out to larger subs to help newbies solve headache problems with a warm heart.

    <TEXT>Thank you for your encouragement. Surely, I can edit on Thinkpad, but I still need a place to collect related information in one place. /r/LinuxOnThinkpad at the beginning is a joint effort with ThinkWiki which I am sure you know of. We'd like to move all verified knowledge to ThinkWiki instead of /r/Thinkpad and /r/LinuxOnThinkpad for its established popularity and audience. In the meantime, we also work with software developers (like the Validity fingerprint reader hacks). As you can see from this thread, /r/Thinkpad has too many people who don't care about people who make contributions to the software and wiki knowledge collections -- maybe only when they are using the products created by those volunteers -- or even gave negative attitudes to those contributors. It's VERY discouraging and disappointing to handle and to respond to people like that on /r/Thinkpad. I really just want to gather a few reliable team members to work together and support each other for a positive growth of the community when we have a midge little free time. I really appreciate that you have a different attitude from most of the rest responses. Sorry for the spams caused by forwarding posts from this sub. If there is anything I can do to stop /u/totesmessenger here (I have reported to Reddit people for multiple times), please let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The last I checked, ThinkWiki account creation was suspended and the person running the site wasn't replying to emails. Has that changed? If you want to improve ThinkWiki, why not just edit ThinkWiki directly? Why the subreddit wiki at all? I emailed the creator of ThinkWiki, but never got responded. His coworker who doesn't have the user management power told me that the creator of ThinkWiki might only check email 1-2 times a year not to mention to respond. So, I have never gotten a ThinkWiki account there. What is what I am doing is to chat through the IRC of ThinkWiki with people who can edit ThinkWiki to help verify and move content from our wiki there. I hope this is a better solution to maintain an active wiki page for Thinkpads. All in all, we still need a place to collect information from all related subreddit, the official Lenovo forum, thinkpad forums and so on. That is why I created /r/LinuxOnThinkpad.  gt; Sure there are a lot of people here who don't care about Linux, but I've really not seen people who have ever been negative about contributions to the wiki. Mostly if someone doesn't use Linux, they just don't care about those that do. Yes, I always get karma point on /r/LinuxOnThinkpad, but not here. You should check how many negative karma I get from responding people here to clarify things, and how people negatively responded to [my clarification post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/7h890i/clarification_of_the_purpose_of_building/)--maybe without reading. I hate to say, but I have to tell you that this happened before on /r/Thinkpad. I am disappointed at /r/Thinkpad people, that is why I use the words, irresponsible, blind, ignorant, aren't they? If you can help to change the dynamics, that would be great! I don't have any patience to respond to them now. If you have any other people in mind who is willing to make similar contributions as mine or better ideas, I appreciate it if you can let me know by PMs.  gt; You're welcome to do as you like, but it seems like you're creating a very very niche subreddit that nobody seems to be contributing to. To be frank, I agree with everyone saying it's too niche, and feel that we'd all be better off if we concentrated on a single wiki. Again, I'd like to have people posting Linux On Thinkpad stuff on /r/Thinkpad and /r/Linux and other bigger subs, so that they receive responses from a bigger audience. Collecting content for ThinkWiki or similar knowledge sharing shouldn't reduce the amount of people who post here. If they do only want to talk to Thinkpad users with Linux knowledge, then /r/LinuxOnThinkpads I created is for them, where no post-forwarding is allowed. Fortunately, I am still working with some software developers who joint the sub I own on hacking out the Thinkpad linux bugs, at least for myself to use my computers well enough. Given the negative environment I have experienced, and the fact that few people care about it, I would just ignore the rest people on /r/Thinkpad who are having a selfish culture in mind. But thank you for taking time responding in any case.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have access to W530, but I have P50 at hand. One thing I have to say is the cooling system on P50 is very good. With max CPU level and max data transmission through Thunderbird and Expresscard slot, the fan noise is very low compared to other workstations in my office (Dell and other older thinkpads). If heating is a problem on old CPUs, you should consider P50/P51 or newer models. Just my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought it's a Lenovo Joke, but it looks pretty serious in the manual.  gt; We recommend you perform dust cleaning at least once a month to reduce the amount of dust accumulation around the heat sink. Place your computer in a clean environment with good ventilation when performing dust cleaning Plus, if search online, there are a bunch of YouTube tutorials on how it works... See [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQv3dcdqXyw). Does it really work? I am not sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's the GPU fan. I had a similar problem a while ago on the GPU fan, cracking noise (sounds like there is something touching the fan leaves). Since I was using multiple monitors, I guess it was something pumped into the fan area from the intakes. So, I opened the palmrest and blew compressed air in, everything works quietly again as before. I guess you may have a similar problem. The design of the laptop is very compact, anything small sucked in could cause a problem like that, but usually not a big deal to solve. That's my guess. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have Carbon neither WD SSDs, but a P50 with the SSD and HDD mixture and with a dual OS installed. Installing OS's on an SSD card will boost the performance dramatically, while a PCIe card will draw energy and generate a lot of heat to make things unstable when it's used heavily. For what I heard, the power consuming for cards of the same brand might not have much performance difference. So, don't worry too much. My only suggestion is to have your backup regularly with some external HDD, for example.</TEXT>

No one can ensure that a language now will definitely become a surviving language in the future for QC. So, my suggestion for you is to learn the core theory of QC as a CS student. Python, or even Julia may be more popular than Q# or others to have enough supporting packages for you to try your hands. Maybe someday in the future, you can invent another language as well :-)</TEXT>

BTW, sorry to hear about your experience. I moved from Samsung phones to Honor phones, so far my phone is much better than ever before, in terms of performance, battery life and interface convenience. Certainly, I don't care about Google updates at all, EMUI has already built in enough AI functions to reduce battery consuming and app usage, which is Android doing now. I neither care about what the US government is saying. Stupid things have been happening with the Trump administration gov already. Good luck to your next phone!</TEXT>
