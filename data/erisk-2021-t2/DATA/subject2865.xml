    <TEXT>YTA. Distancing yourself instead of talking the issue through with her is childish, especially because you can tell it #8217;s hurting her and she #8217;s overwhelmed. If you #8217;re really best friends you should be able to be honest with her about her kid, how it is impacting you, and maybe, I don #8217;t know, trying to help her figure out how to get a handle on things? You don #8217;t have to fix her or her kid, but you should be there to support her. She doesn #8217;t deserve what you #8217;re doing to her right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that focusing the conversation less on her parenting and more on the fact that you are concerned about her and her child #8217;s wellbeing along with the state of your friendship could help. It sounds like she really values your friendship and is going through a rough time. I would acknowledge that you know she #8217;s working her ass off and mothering her child to the best of her ability. Would she ever be comfortable with a babysitter? Maybe you guys could plan a night out and you could offer to pitch in a little for the babysitter #8217;s pay (by no means are you obligated too, though. just an idea!). This is a tough situation, I #8217;m sorry you have to navigate it. I hope all goes well!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In all honesty, some days I control them and some days they run wild. I'll have obsessive, intrusive thoughts that I said something wrong in a situation and then everyone hates me, that my family thinks I'm weak and doesn't love me, that I've been 'living life wrong' (a bit of Existential OCD), or my favorite: that I don't actually have OCD. What my OCD wants me to do is to 'double-check'  #8211; that is, asking my mom if she's sure she loves me, constantly going over with my friends if what I said at a party was weird/awkward, and to obsessively research to see if other people have the same thoughts as me. 'Controlling' it is just doing my best not to act on the desire to check-in with people. It's almost a physical feeling of discomfort when I don't, but the longer I hold off the easier it gets. The best thing for me recently has been having some kind of audio/TV Show/movie in the background so I'm not tempted to loop on those thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know a little about OCPD, but I have never known anyone in my life that has it, so if I #8217;m a little off base please feel free to correct me! I think a big difference between us - or any two people with OCD and OCPD - is that a majority of OCD suffers are actually acutely aware of how irrational they #8217;re being. For example, often I fear food. I know this is ridiculous because you need food to survive, but the OCD  #8216;voice #8217; is so loud that I #8217;d rather just not eat so I don #8217;t feel terrible about eating. Even when I was hospitalized, I remember crying over eating a sweet potato and I turned to someone mid-breakdown and went  #8220;This is so dumb. It #8217;s just a potato! #8221; and then resumed crying. As far as my anxieties go... when I was younger they were much more irrational. Like if I had a passing, violent thought I would assume I was bound to be a serial killer. Now I know that thought was irrational. Presently, my anxieties revolve around  #8216;normal #8217; thoughts that most people have ( #8216;do I look fat? #8217;  #8216;am I a good person? #8217;  #8216;did I say the wrong thing? #8217;) except they #8217;re RELENTLESS and I end up catastrophizing. If you don #8217;t mind me asking, how has having OCPD impacted your life/personal relationships? When did you seek help (or a diagnosis) and how did you know to do so?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did, at her request, buy a cat scratch post! And we #8217;ve slowly been training her to not scratch (she does it a lot less now). So I #8217;ve put money into training her and preventing this. I am constantly trimming her nails and disciplining her. I do see your point though, thank you for your suggestions! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>like many people, i #8217;m prone to anxiety. i actually have ocd, so i #8217;ve been thinking about nothing else for 72 hours (nightmares about it too), glued to the news  amp; texting my family in singapore (they went for CNY but are not allowed back inside shanghai - where they live - until feb 2nd i believe). they #8217;re fine, but they #8217;re looking into flying from singapore to australia to see other family. considering there have been cases in both countries, that doesn #8217;t make me feel any better. also, i just finished the stand by stephen king about a week ago. so. feeling great. that being said, WHY do so many people want this to be the end of the world? it #8217;s like they #8217;ll shut down any good news that comes out. is it because it seems interesting from  #8216;outside #8217; wuhan? is it movies like contagion or books like the stand that make it seem exciting? i can #8217;t help but feel like so many people in this sub want this to be armageddon. others, i know, are just anxious and wanting to be prepped - i get that. it #8217;s the people scrambling to be the bearers of bad (often fake) news that i don #8217;t understand. anyway, it #8217;s morning and i #8217;m trying to convince myself to leave the apartment. i didn #8217;t know where else to put this. i hope u anxious people are feeling a little better today.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-11 03:15:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>so i #8217;ve tried to quit before and failed. two weeks ago i didn #8217;t take kratom for 2 days and had a 36 hour panic attack. the only thing that helped was xanax but i do NOT want to get addicted to that. (i went from 15GPD to nothing during this time btw) as soon as i got back on kratom i was fine. i have preexisting mental illness (OCD GAD ) and i think the CT really set it off... but i could be wrong. would tapering help with this issue? i can manage some anxiety but i #8217;m sitting here right now close to tears after not dosing for 12 hours bc my chest is tight and im afraid im going to have a panic attack. im a 21 yr old college student (female, if tht counts for anything). ive been taking for 7 months. pls help, im panicking!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-12 00:08:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>oh man, i've been doing kratom for about 5 months now. it started out as a nightly thing, then a morning and night thing, and then, more recently, an 'i cannot go 3 hours without kratom or i start to have a panic attack' thing. yesterday i had about 14 grams  #8211; that was nearly 24 hours ago. tonight i am taking 8 grams. i know this seems like a weird taper - and it is - but i wanted to do hard jumps to prove to myself i can manage it. that said, i barely managed the WDs today - in class (im a college student, 21f) i started to tense up really badly  #8211; my legs were in constant motion, flexing and unflexing, and i was doing the same with my hands because i thought i was going to burst out of my skin. my professor looked extrememly concerned when i pretty much sprinted into the bathroom to splash water on my face. right now my chest is tight, i have bags under my eyes, and i am on the verge of tears because of RLS and anxiety. but i have held out. i forced myself to take public transportation today so that i had to walk and that really helped. anyway, tomorrow i am either dropping a g or .5 g. just wanted to update u all. kratom has ruined my life; i used to be an honor roll student with a scholarship and i have a 2.5gpa now and have fucked up my mental health to another level. but? it'll all work out. it's just going to be hard.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>can #8217;t tell if it #8217;s bipolar ii, ocd, or both.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 01:50:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! BACKGROUND: So I was diagnosed with OCD at 12, have been on over 12 SSRI #8217;s and SNRI #8217;s, and had a six month stint in the hospital for anorexia. I just went to another psychiatrist today who said he thinks I might have bipolar ii. Here #8217;s the thing, though - my hypomanic episodes are definitely on the lesser scale, not flow blown mania. Also, I can sleep during these episodes. Mostly, I just feel like my moods are all over the place, but daily. Like intense swings for no reason, every day. Every night though, I always go back to the anxiety/depression. So I guess I just don #8217;t understand. Has anyone had anything that sounds similar? I #8217;m not asking if this is bipolar - I did read the rules and I don #8217;t expect anyone to diagnose me! - but moreso asking if anyone has a similar experience, maybe with OCD and violent emotional shifts daily as opposed to in longer stretches?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. I think accepting/believing that the worst will absolutely happen can sometimes be a coping mechanism for those who have a very intense fear of /not/ knowing. Granted, we all experience discomfort when faced with unknowns - it #8217;s human nature - but I can see how there could be a sense of security in  #8216;knowing #8217; how it will all end, even if it #8217;s terrible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>honestly, what #8217;s helped me the most is realizing that a) my interpretation of what people are feeling about me (which is usually negative) is wrong 80% of the time and b) befriending people who are very, very opposite of me and watching/listening to how they react and feel is beneficial. it pulls me slightly out of the mindset that i can  #8216;mind read #8217; everyone and they always feel and react the same as i do. hang in there. there are plenty of people who only like 1:1 interactions. i used to be like that too, and my friends now have a running joke that if they want me to stay late at a party, they have to tell me that the event starts later than it actually does bc after about 3 hours i tap out. there are people who are good for u out there, but u have to be open to finding them, which is hard. but u can do it. ur not alone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by accidentally taking a double dose of my ADHD meds.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 20:20:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>TIFU by accidentally taking a double dose of my ADHD meds. So I #8217;m prescribed 50mg of Vyvanse, and have been since I was 14. 50mg is a higher dose for someone in my age/weight bracket (early 20s F, 115 lbs) because the highest legal dose is 70mg. Keep this is in mind. I have a bizarre sleep schedule with a cute sprinkle of insomnia, so some nights I don #8217;t fall asleep until 5am, and that #8217;s what happened last night (this morning). I set an alarm for 10am, woke up around 10:30, took my Vyvanse, laid down for a little bit, and somehow fell back to sleep. At about 11:30-12 I wake back up, still groggy. It takes my Vyvanse about 2 hours to fully kick in, so I #8217;m still a little out of it. This is where I fucked up. I #8217;m so used to waking up and just BEING up that I started my morning routine over again on autopilot. I strolled over the coffee machine, started to make some, and took my dose of Vyvanse. I realized about 10 seconds after I #8217;d taken it that I had already taken it. Here #8217;s the thing, I can #8217;t throw up. I #8217;ve thrown up twice in my entire life. So that wasn #8217;t an option. Cue frantic googling. Pretty much everyone says I #8217;m going to be in for a wild day, and to stay hydrated. I try to look on the bright side #8212;maybe I #8217;ll get a lot of work done today! #8212;but I was foolish. It #8217;s been 3 hours since my last dose. I #8217;ve peed around twenty times. I can feel my blood. I took one hit from my Juul and transcended time and space. My stomach is furious. I tried to reorganize my room, started to hammer something into the wall, hit my thumb. Cried. Put my clothes in the dryer and then felt like I needed to have them Extra Dry so I ran them again, the lint in there started burning. Cried. All of my whites now smell like Chicago in 1871. My body is in fight or flight. I #8217;m so anxious. 30 min ago my mom #8217;s best friend texted me  #8216;Your parents #8217; and nothing else. By the time she responded to my  #8216;??? #8217; fifteen minutes later with the picture of my mom and dad when they were younger that she meant to attach, I had already accepted that I was an orphan and was halfway through an article re: how to deal with the sudden passing of your parents. My cat came into my bedroom and I got scared. I didn #8217;t like her stance or general demeanor. Currently, I #8217;m applying for grad school. I don #8217;t know why. I #8217;m not even done with undergrad. But it feels like something I should do right now. Anyway. I #8217;ll be fine. I #8217;ve actually done this one other time and ended up being alright, just very fast for a while. Have a good one, all. Take meds responsibly. TL;DR I took 100mg of Vyvanse when I #8217;m prescribed 50mg, am currently paranoid, distraught, and feeling like I have an IQ of 1000 and -17 at the same time. EDIT: Holy shit! I appreciate all of the concerns and nice comments lol. I #8217;m doing alright, I #8217;ve had a lot of water and feel 75% normal. Still wide awake, obviously. Hopefully this inspired a few people to use those pill organizers. I just ordered one. Also, I did not finish applying to grad school. I made the amazing decision to take out loans for undergrad in NYC and if I get into any more debt I #8217;ll never be able to afford groceries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This made me cry. You #8217;re doing fantastic; it #8217;s so hard to make yourself get help when you #8217;re in that kind of state. You #8217;re being an amazing mother BY doing exactly this, which means you DO love your daughter. You #8217;re making an effort to be there for the people you love, and to live your life both for yourself and for them. So so proud of you :)</TEXT>
