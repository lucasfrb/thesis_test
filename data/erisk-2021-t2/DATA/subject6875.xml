    <TITLE>Reporting a scam junk mail?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-01 18:55:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got an unaddressed envelope in the mail yesterday, and inside was what appeared to be a xerox of a newspaper article with a handwritten note recommending it to me form "Dr. E." But it's not a real article and the "note" is printed on, of course. Given that it's a product for older guys (prostate), they're hoping I'll be gullible enough to think it's from some doctor I know, and call the 800# in the "article". I'm pretty sure misrepresenting your product as endorsed by a doctor isn't legal. Any advice on where to report this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you pay for an AMA membership, one of the big selling points is Roadside Assistance, and it's great when it works. But since Wednesday night (and I think earlier), they've been quoting a wait time of 48 hours, which just isn't very helpful, especially if your car died on the road or some parking lot. But IF you want a new battery or need your door keys replaced (as opposed to a boost or a lockout), the wait time is 4 hours - not 2 days. In other words, if you'll pay more you'll get faster service. I didn't think that was how it was supposed to work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A couple of years ago my vet was bought out by a veterinary chain, and I feel they've changed emphasis to - money. At my cat's first checkup after the change, they waited until the end then asked how often she barfs. When I said once or twice a week, as always, they suggested I get her $400 worth of blood tests. (Every cat I've known barfs that often.) On the latest visit they noted that her back teeth are pretty brown, and suggested a teeth cleaning. It would be $1000 (CDN) because of the general anesthetic, and another $600 if an extraction is required. Does that make sense to anybody?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've only traced this to a blog on a conservative radio station so far. "It's Not "Just The Flu" Tuesday, March 17, 2020 5:05 a.m. by Tom King Some insight from Kat Storti for those who continue to say..."It's just the flu". "Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu? Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don #8217;t understand... It has to do with RNA sequencing.... I.e. genetics. Seasonal flu is an  #8220;all human virus #8221;. The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system. This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year... you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot. Novel viruses, come from animals.... the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu). But once, one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it #8217;s a problem, Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity.. the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn #8217;t human, and the human immune system doesn #8217;t recognize it so, we can #8217;t fight it off. Now.... sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human, for years it #8217;s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human... once that happens..we have a new contagion phase. And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, thats what decides how contagious, or how deadly it #8217;s gonna be.. H1N1 was deadly....but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu. It #8217;s RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently, too. Fast forward. Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability,  #8220;slippery #8221; This Coronavirus, not being in any form a  #8220;human #8221; virus (whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity). Took off like a rocket. And this was because, Humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it. And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way the way that it causes great damage to human lungs.. That #8217;s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza.... this one is slippery AF. And it #8217;s a lung eater...And, it #8217;s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine. We really have no tools in our shed, with this. History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu. Factoid: Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social isolation... And let me end by saying....right now it #8217;s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next. Be smart folks... acting like you #8217;re unafraid is so not sexy right now. No idea who "Kat Storti" is. #flattenthecurve . Stay home folks... and share this to those that just are not catching on.  #129299;"-Kat Storti "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "On Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its report on the employment situation in May. The report was much better than most economists expected, showing a large gain in jobs and a fall in the unemployment rate. The thing is, a good jobs report may be bad for future policy. Why? Because the U.S. economy is still very much on life support. And a bit of good news is all too likely to encourage the usual suspects to end that life support too soon, with dire effects just a few months from now. Before I get there, let me address one widespread concern. Were the employment numbers rigged? No, they weren #8217;t. No doubt the Trump administration, which lies about everything, would fake the numbers if it could. And the Trump-appointed head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a Heritage Foundation hack, with a long history of making ludicrous claims about the effects of tax cuts, the burden of the estate tax, and more. But the jobs report is prepared by a large, professional staff that takes its responsibilities seriously. And it contains much more than the headline numbers. It #8217;s not the kind of thing that could be altered with a Sharpie, and any effort to fake it would have set off multiple alarm bells. In fact, the overall picture painted by the employment report makes considerable sense. It shows a partial bounce back of contact-intensive sectors like restaurants and dentists #8217; offices that were largely shut down by social distancing; these are exactly the things you #8217;d expect to show some growth as social distancing is relaxed. So the good news, despite statistical problems created by the unique economic situation  #8212; problems the bureau acknowledges  #8212; is real. But it #8217;s also very limited. So far, employment numbers in this time of Covid-19 look like a fishhook: a huge decline followed by a much smaller upturn. Unemployment is still higher than it was for most of the Great Depression. And while unemployment over all fell in May, it rose slightly for black workers. The saving graces of the situation, such as they are, are that (a) while there is immense economic hardship, it #8217;s not nearly as severe as you might have expected given Depression-level unemployment and (b) the employment slump has so far been mostly limited to contact-intensive sectors. That is, the crisis hasn #8217;t  #8212; yet  #8212; spilled over into a crash of the economy as a whole. Both these saving graces, however, are the result of emergency aid  #8212; the safety net hurriedly put in place in late March, largely at Democrats #8217; insistence. This safety net alleviated hardship while allowing the unemployed to maintain spending and encouraging businesses to maintain their payrolls. And unless Congress and the White House act, that safety net will be yanked away by August. More specifically, enhanced unemployment benefits, which are both more generous than standard benefits and cover more people, have been a huge source of support despite the difficulties many have faced in getting enrolled. Among other things, those benefits have  #8212; temporarily  #8212; made it possible for millions of families to keep paying rent on their homes. But those benefits will expire July 31. And the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers small businesses loans that can be converted into grants if they #8217;re used to maintain payroll, is already out of money, and the job support lasts only eight weeks. Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. So two of the main things sustaining the economy are set to disappear. At the same time, Congress has yet to provide major relief to state and local governments, which are facing a huge fiscal crisis and have already laid off a million and a half workers; there will soon be many more layoffs unless aid comes soon. In other words, we #8217;re facing probable disaster in the near future unless Congress acts. But here #8217;s the thing: Republicans just hate helping the unemployed, hate aiding states, in fact hate any kind of disaster response other than tax cuts. And the uptick in jobs gives them an excuse to indulge their hatred. House Democrats have passed the HEROES Act, a very good bill extending and improving economic relief. But Friday #8217;s employment report encourages Republicans to revert to type; they #8217;ll almost surely block any significant further relief until or unless the economic situation becomes even more dire than it is. It also encourages them to push for more opening, more relaxation of social distancing, despite the fact that Covid-19 is nowhere near under control and there are early indications that the pandemic may be roaring back to life as states reopen. So it #8217;s all too possible that we #8217;ll see an ugly scene in the late summer and early fall  #8212; more government layoffs and widespread job losses in industries that have so far been relatively unscathed as desperate workers slash spending, all against the backdrop of a resurgence in hospitalizations and deaths. And the May uptick in jobs makes that scene more likely, because it promotes more wishful thinking from the people who insisted a few months ago that Covid-19 would go away and posed no threat to the economy. Maybe we #8217;ll be lucky and the bad things I #8217;m worried about won #8217;t actually materialize. But hoping for the best isn #8217;t a plan."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT shortened for length: "The White House communications team has gone to great lengths to present President Trump #8217;s position on the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests as evenhanded and sympathetic. He has twice offered scripted responses to the protests that approximate the expected tone of a president faced with roiling unrest, including his comments from the White House Rose Garden on June 1 when he declared that he was  #8220;an ally of all peaceful protesters. #8221; That federal officials were simultaneously using tear gas, batons and explosive devices to clear a nearby park of peaceful protesters was simply a coincidence. Efforts to present Trump as understanding of the protests, though, conflict with the president #8217;s obvious and visceral dislike of what is happening and his determined effort to cast the protests as an extension of violent far-left opposition to American ideals. Trump keeps insisting that the worst effects of the early demonstrations were a function of  #8220;antifa, #8221; a loosely knit movement that opposes fascism and racism. Antifa is a useful enemy for Trump in the moment, allowing him to avoid criticizing black protesters and to identify the opposing wing of American politics as dangerous. That the role of antifa has been limited has not prevented Trump from blaming it broadly. It wasn #8217;t clear how much of Trump #8217;s focus on antifa was opportunistic and how much actually derived from a belief that antifa is a frightening force jeopardizing the union. In a single, bizarre tweet on Tuesday morning, we got our answer. [Godawful Trump tweet] Last Thursday, 75-year-old Martin Gugino, a longtime activist in Buffalo, approached an advancing line of police officers in that city. It #8217;s not clear why; video captured by a reporter for a local radio station doesn #8217;t include any audio. Shortly after Gugino approached, holding his phone in his hand, a police officer pushed him, causing Gugino to stumble backward, fall and hit his head on the pavement. Police walk by as Gugino bleeds on the sidewalk. Two officers were suspended after the video emerged, prompting more than 50 others to resign their positions with a special group within the Buffalo Police Department in protest. That was the story, until the unfailingly pro-Trump network One America News ran a segment elevating ridiculous accusations about Gugino from a right-wing website called Conservative Treehouse. It #8217;s not the first time that One America News has pushed out obviously nonsensical conspiracy theories. Earlier this year, reporter Chanel Rion reported that the coronavirus originated in North Carolina  #8212; because some random unidentified guy on Twitter said it had. Rion is OAN #8217;s White House reporter, who attends White House press briefings at the invitation of the administration after the White House press corps barred her for violating social distancing efforts. Trump loves OAN because of its loyalty to his presidency and his politics. He has often used it as a foil to Fox News when he feels that Fox has strayed too far from him, as when it interviews Democratic legislators. It #8217;s not surprising, then, that he saw OAN #8217;s most recent conspiratorial report. It is still somehow surprising, though, that he decided it was worth sharing with the American public. If you'd like to see the report on Gugino to which Trump's refers, it's here. It's so obviously false and so impressively sloppy that it's not worth sharing directly. But we should nonetheless parse its contents. The report is from OAN's Kristian Rouz, whose prior media employment was with Sputnik News  #8212; an outlet funded by the Kremlin. (A Daily Beast report from last year indicated that Rouz was working for both outlets simultaneously.) Rouz is no stranger to antifa conspiracy theories, having  #8220;reported #8221; in 2017 that Hillary Clinton's political action committee provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to antifa. In this case, Rouz claims that Gugino was part of a  #8220;false flag provocation by far left group antifa. #8221; In other words, that the elderly Gugino intentionally injured himself to make the police look bad, as though there were no other available evidence of the police treating protesters in questionable ways. The evidence that Gugino is antifa? That he was holding his phone in his hand.  #8220;Newly released videos appear to show Gugino using a police tracker on his phone trying to scan police communications during the protest, #8221; Rouz says.  #8220;The tactic, known as skimming, is an old trick used by antifa to locate police officers and plan violence activities, bypassing the police response. #8221; First, there are no  #8220;newly released videos #8221;  #8212; just the original video of Gugino approaching the police. Second, this theory about Gugino scanning police communications devices is an obvious effort to create a justification for police to push him away. Cellphones can be used to record information from embedded chips that put out short-range signals; this is how tap-to-pay systems work, essentially. But beyond Gugino holding his phone in his hand, there #8217;s no evidence this is what he was doing. There #8217;s no evidence that the places he held his phone had any chips that would emit such a signal. There #8217;s no evidence that if he had collected any information about the chips being used that he would be able to do anything with them. There #8217;s no evidence  #8212; besides the claims of this one website  #8212; that this is an  #8220;old trick #8221; used by antifa. Particularly since the implementation of near-field communications (as this short-range interface is called) has happened within the last 10 years. Shown in real-time, Gugino is obviously just gesticulating and pointing. The Conservative Treehouse blog  #8212; which slows Gugino's motions down in order to make them appear more nefarious  #8212; argues that it's suspicious when Gugino holds his phone near a police officer's radio microphone. But that microphone is connected to the radio itself, which broadcasts publicly. What information is Gugino supposed to be picking up here? The frequency at which Buffalo police radios broadcast? If so, he could have saved himself a head wound by Googling it. ... Gugino remains hospitalized in critical condition."</TEXT>

Category 4: Nature of the call is time-sensitive; response is less than 40 minutes; Ex: "a shoplifter is in custody with security and is co-operative." Category 5: Nature of the offence is not time-sensitive; response time is less than 180 minutes; Ex: a business finds they were vandalized the night before (i.e., the absence of *in progress* or *just occurred*." (The chief said he couldn't break down how many are Category 4 or 5.) Definitely sounds to me like re-allocating money needs to be seriously studied, and likely implemented. #ReImaginePolice</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "By himself, President Trump couldn #8217;t have come up with the conspiracy theory underlying his recent attack on Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old Buffalo-area protester who was shoved to the ground last week by Buffalo police. The incident took place outside of Buffalo City Hall, and video captured the encounter. Gugino wound up supine on the sidewalk, and a pool of blood formed around his head. Assault charges were filed against two Buffalo police officers, who were suspended over the incident. Nearly 60 officers in the elite Emergency Response Team quit the unit over the treatment of the officers. Pretty straightforward, huh? Not for Trump, who gathered some information about the case from One America News Network. That cable network, in turn, appears to have grabbed the idea from the blog Conservative Treehouse. Here #8217;s the gist: Donald J. Trump  #10004; @realDonaldTrump Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up? Okay, that baseless allegation is bad enough. As Ashley Parker and John Wagner write in The Post, the tweet  #8220;demoralized some aides and allies, who were frustrated if not particularly surprised by Trump #8217;s latest incendiary suggestion. #8221; Kelly Zarcone, a New York lawyer who #8217;s representing Gugino, issued this statement:  #8220;Martin has always been a PEACEFUL protester because he cares about today #8217;s society. He is also a typical Western New Yorker who loves his family. No one from law enforcement has suggested otherwise so we #8217;re at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such a dark, dangerous and untrue accusation against him. #8221; Gugino is part of the Catholic Worker Movement and a member of the Western New York Peace Center, as well as a Buffalo group that advocates for economic justice and affordable housing. Leveling the allegation is one thing; defending it is another, as White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany demonstrated in a chat on Wednesday morning with the folks on  #8220;Fox  amp; Friends. #8221; Asked about the president #8217;s claim regarding Gugino #8217;s alleged affiliation with antifa, McEnany responded with this mouthful: So the president was raising questions based on a report that he saw. Other questions that need to be asked in every case, we can #8217;t jump on one side without looking at all the facts at play. This individual had some very questionable tweets, some profanity-laden tweets about police officers. Of course no one condones any sort of violence. We need the appropriate amount of force used in any interaction. But there are a lot of questions in that case. In fact, you had 56 police officers who resigned in protest of how their fellow officers were treated. So I think we need to ask why those officers resigned, what happened, what facts were on the ground. The president was just raising some of those questions. Boldface inserted to highlight a dangerous bit of official commentary. In the aftermath of the assault against Gugino, his Twitter account has been locked. As for what may have troubled McEnany about the account, there #8217;s a hint in this Buffalo News piece: On June 3, the day before the pushing incident, Gugino retweeted Emma Gonzalez, one of the survivors of the Parkland school shootings who has herself become an activist. She wrote  #8220;(expletive) the police. #8221; And he commented on the retweet the same words. The phrase has been repeatedly used during the protests here in Buffalo and across the nation. Correct: In apparently deploying profanity regarding the police, Gugino joined millions upon millions of Americans. So what bearing does McEnany believe his tweets have on his interactions with Buffalo police? What kind of thought-control scheme do we have here? Or does his Twitter account unlock the mystery/conspiracy theory about his alleged ties to Antifa? We #8217;ve asked McEnany why the tweets are so important to this case. We #8217;ll update this post if we get a response. As of Wednesday, Gugino remained in the hospital but was recuperating, according to Zarcone. As he recuperates, he faces a president who thinks nothing of sliming him. It doesn #8217;t end there, however: He also faces a willing collaborator in McEnany, someone who signed up to advance and sharpen Trump #8217;s smears. She #8217;s just doing her job."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT edited for length: "Like the cavalry riding over the hill to save the day, guardians of justice are rushing forth to support the sanctity of the rule of law and due process from the maundering authoritarians in the Trump administration. For nearly four years, the Justice Department has been deformed and corrupted, becoming the unbridled defender of President Trump #8217;s personal interests. Whether misleading the courts on the 2020 Census, giving Trump a free pass on his impeachable conduct regarding Ukraine, or mischaracterizing the Mueller report so as conceal evidence of Trump #8217;s illegal conduct, the agency under Attorney General William P. Barr, along with the White House counsel #8217;s office, have threatened to shred the concept that the president is not above the law and to permanently mar the Justice Department #8217;s reputation. Now, some lawyers are saying,  #8220;Not so fast! #8221; On Wednesday, more than 1,250 former Justice Department employees issued a scathing letter to the department #8217;s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, concerning  #8220;Attorney General Barr #8217;s possible role in ordering law enforcement personnel to suppress a peaceful domestic protest in Lafayette Square on June 1, 2020, for the purpose of enabling President Trump to walk across the street from the White House and stage a photo op at St. John #8217;s [Episcopal] Church, a politically motivated event in which Attorney General Barr participated. #8221; The Justice Department alumni argue that Barr #8217;s actions may have violated the First and Fourth Amendments and that, in deploying an alphabet soup of federal law enforcement groups to suppress protected speech, Barr #8217;s conduct raised  #8220;profound doubts that the personnel deployed from these agencies are adequately trained in policing mass protests or protecting the constitutional rights of individuals who are not subject to arrest or have not been convicted of a crime. #8221; They ask that Horowitz  #8220;immediately open and conduct an investigation of the full scope of the Attorney General #8217;s and the [Justice Department #8217;s] role in these events. The rule of law, the maintenance of the Department #8217;s integrity, and the very safety of our citizens demand nothing less. #8221; Regardless of whether Horowitz takes up the issue, the letter serves as an investigative road map for the next administration to review Barr #8217;s conduct and for bar associations to consider whether Justice Department lawyers who participated in these actions adhered to their professional responsibilities. Most critically, the letter may rouse current lawyers in the department to resist illegal orders and to affirm their obligations to uphold and defend the Constitution. (Many former government officials are trying to set an example by tweeting the hashtag #UpholdTheOath along with the oath they took when installed in government.) Also on Wednesday, retired New York federal judge John Gleeson filed his amicus brief at the invitation of U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on whether to accept the Justice Department #8217;s decision to dismiss the charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn  #8212; for which Flynn had already pleaded guilty  #8212; concerning his lies to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 transition. (Since the engagement of Gleeson to brief the issue, transcripts of the calls affirm that Flynn blatantly lied to the FBI concerning discussions about lifting sanctions against Russia.) While Sullivan considers Gleeson #8217;s brief, an appeals court is already considering a motion from Flynn #8217;s lawyers challenging Sullivan #8217;s refusal to dismiss the case upon request attacking his action as biased and beyond the scope of his authority. (The Post explains,  #8220;Flynn #8217;s lawyers have accused Sullivan of bias and asked the federal appeals court to intervene, asking that it order Sullivan to drop the prosecution immediately or to reassign Flynn #8217;s case to another judge. #8221;) Former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller tells me,  #8220;It #8217;s a detailed and devastating take-down of the Justice Department #8217;s argument that makes clear just how corrupt Barr #8217;s intervention in this case was. Because of the D.C. Circuit #8217;s involvement, it may take some time, but I suspect justice will eventually be done in this case. #8221; A respected jurist and former prosecutor, Gleeson is unsparing:  #8220;The Government #8217;s ostensible grounds for seeking dismissal are conclusively disproven by its own briefs filed earlier in this very proceeding, #8221; he argues.  #8220;They contradict and ignore this Court #8217;s prior orders, which constitute law of the case. They are riddled with inexplicable and elementary errors of law and fact. #8221; Accordingly,  #8220;leave of court should not be granted when the explanations the Government puts forth are not credible as the real reasons for its dismissal of a criminal charge. #8221; Gleeson also persuasively argues that the government is guilty of prosecutorial misconduct.  #8220;The Government has engaged in highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President. The facts of this case overcome the presumption of regularity. The Court should therefore deny the Government #8217;s motion to dismiss, adjudicate any remaining motions, and then sentence the Defendant. #8221; Finally, Gleeson presents the argument that Flynn is guilty of perjury, though he recommends that this be taken into account on sentencing rather than serve as the basis for a new charge of contempt of court. Gleeson writes:  #8220;There is irrefutable evidence in the record that Flynn made material false statements to this Court in his Declaration in Support of his Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Plea of Guilty . . . on two topics: (i) whether he knowingly made materially false statements to the FBI. . . and (ii) whether the FBI induced him to enter a plea by threatening to prosecute his son. #8221; If Flynn #8217;s original declaration was truthful, as the transcripts confirm it was, then the newest declaration is false.  #8220;Under federal law, a defendant who makes two or more material declarations under oath before a U.S. court that  #8216;are inconsistent to the degree that one of [those declarations] is necessarily false #8217; has committed perjury, even without proof as to which statement is false, #8221; Gleeson writes. In sum, both the Justice Department alumni letter and Gleeson #8217;s brief boldly reaffirm the rule of law and the impermissibility of using law enforcement to do the president #8217;s political bidding."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Does President Trump want to expose his strongest supporters to a deadly disease? Does he think Oklahoma is in play in 2020? You #8217;d be excused for thinking so, given his latest campaign maneuvers. Trump is determined to have an unmasked, crowded convention reception  #8212; with plenty of attendees 50 or older  #8212; for his nomination acceptance speech in August. North Carolina said he could not flout his administration #8217;s guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so he is poised to decamp to Florida, where the compliant Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) apparently does not much care whether he creates a hot spot in the state with the nation #8217;s second-highest share of residents 65 and older. All this occurs at a time when there is a surge in coronavirus cases in states that precipitously reopened. The New York Times reported Wednesday that 21 states are experiencing an uptick in cases ( #8220;[Persistent] growth continues in Arkansas, North Carolina and Florida. And in South Carolina, there have been nearly 1,000 new cases in the last two days #8221;). Counties with the highest number of new cases are primarily in red states (Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas). But Trump is not just trying to set up a potentially dangerous convention in Jacksonville; he is also undertaking a campaign swing with massive rallies in red states  #8212; many of which are experiencing the most cases. First stop, Oklahoma! This is not a state Trump should have to campaign in (if it is in play for November, Trump is in more trouble than his supporters ever imagined). Likewise, his other rally spots are in states that you would think would be safe, or at least not in need of an urgent visit (Arizona, North Carolina and Texas). Apparently, he really is concerned about losing a slew of states he won in 2016. What would explain these weird decisions? One possibility is that Trump #8217;s internal polls are as bad or worse than public polls, suggesting his reelection chances are evaporating. If this is correct, his choice of these states is a rational and deliberate  #8212; albeit desperate  #8212; effort to salvage a sinking ship. An ABC report bolsters this theory:  #8220;Top aides warned that former Vice President Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, was positioned to defeat the president by a significant number of electoral votes based on the campaign #8217;s analysis, according to multiple sources. #8221; The other explanation for this behavior is that Trump, blinded by the need for untempered adulation by huge crowds, must venture deep into red America to find supporters sufficient to satisfy his ego. This sort of thinking would be disastrous if he is trying to win the election, as it would require him to secure states with plenty of people who do not like, let alone venerate, him. While he is basking in applause in Oklahoma, he is leaving states such as Pennsylvania to Biden and insulting the popular governor of Michigan, another critical state. If Trump is bound and determined to feed his ego rather than work to hold on to marginal states, he is going to lose badly and take plenty of Republicans down with him. One wonders how big donors feel about funding useless trips to red states and a pandemic-spreading convention in a state with plenty of older voters. Moreover, you have to figure that Trump #8217;s fellow Republicans, who have been lectured incessantly to stick with the president, must be getting nervous about an erratic, rudderless campaign not really designed to effectively target the states he must win. I guess they really are willing to go down with the ship."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The speed and scope of the cultural and political sea change following George Floyd #8217;s killing have left many professional politicians and pundits racing to catch up. As we see from the flurry of statue-toppling, the move to banish Confederate icons from the U.S. Capitol #8217;s Statuary Hall, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell #8217;s apology for not listening to protesting players and NASCAR #8217;s ban on Confederate flags, what was barely tolerated a month ago is now widely seen as utterly unacceptable. Policy ideas that never would have been considered possible  #8212; reinventing the police  #8212; now seem reasonable, if not inevitable. And the circle of leaders promoting the cause of rooting out racial injustice has expanded dramatically. Republicans and their retinue of sycophantic media supporters are in denial if they think the same word-smithing games (insisting that  #8220;Defund the police #8221; means  #8220;No police! #8221;) and baseless accusations (wrongly asserting former vice president Joe Biden wants to cut police forces) are going to reach anyone beyond the most cultish, out-of-touch sliver of Americans. These tired, trivial tactics are utterly unsuited to the issues at hand and, hence, become embarrassingly irrelevant. By contrast, some important figures recognize the enormity of the moment and are adjusting swiftly. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gets it. In a remarkable address for the National Defense University graduation ceremonies, he apologized Thursday for his participation in the assault on peaceful protesters near the White House on June 1 designed to provide the floundering president with a photo op.  #8220;As many of you saw the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society, #8221; Milley said bluntly.  #8220;I should not have been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. #8221; He continued:  #8220;We who wear the cloth of our nation come from the people of our nation. And we must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our republic. #8221; His mea culpa went beyond his recent behavior.  #8220;The foundational value that underpins American rights embedded in the Constitution is that all people, no matter who you are, are born free and equal. And I want to address this value in the context of our military, #8221; he said. "Our military has a mixed record on equality. #8221; The killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd by police and vigilantes are part of bigger injustices felt by these black Americans. (Joy Sharon Yi, Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post) He added:  #8220;We cannot afford to marginalize large portions of our potential talent pool or alienate certain demographic groups. No, we need all the talent that American society can muster. Our responsibility as military leaders is to ensure that each and every one of our service members is treated fairly with dignity and respect. And each of them is given equal opportunity to excel. We must, we can, and we will do better. #8221; It is hard to recall a military official at this level publicly prostrating himself so thoroughly. It would not have happened in ordinary times, but these times are anything but ordinary. Milley correctly realized that the culture and legitimacy of the U.S. military are at stake. The times call for people to act in new and extraordinary ways and for those who never considered themselves  #8220;political #8221; to understand that the issue of race goes to the heart of who we are as a country and how we want to live. When someone like LeBron James joins forces with a list of marquee athletes and entertainers to form a group to promote voting and combat voter suppression, you understand that a new cast of people with a different audience grasps the moment. The New York Times reports: Invoking the names of an earlier generation of athletes who called for social justice, Mr. James, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, said he wanted to be a model for future generations.  #8220;I #8217;m inspired by the likes of Muhammad Ali, I #8217;m inspired by the Bill Russells and the Kareem Abdul-Jabbars, the Oscar Robertsons  #8212; those guys who stood when the times were even way worse than they are today, #8221; Mr. James said. . . . In some respects, Mr. James #8217;s activism reflects a return to an earlier generation of athletes who used their fame to speak out about racial equality and the Vietnam War with little regard to whom it might offend. He, too, sees that it is not good enough to leave politics to the professional politicians. The habit of voting has to spread to those who never considered politics to be important. The revulsion over voter suppression has to spread beyond the talking heads, the  #8220;likely voters" and the mainstream news consumers. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reportedly said that Congress must think  #8220;big #8221; on stimulus efforts to counter the covid-19 pandemic. It is worse to do too little than too much. The same should be said about racial injustice."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Again with the apples. Now comes President Trump, not only blaming  #8220;bad apples #8221; for police brutality but asserting that  #8220;there are not too many of them. #8221; The problem, in his view, is just  #8220;a few #8221; bad cops  #8212; and that #8217;s to be expected.  #8220;You always have a bad apple, no matter where you go, #8221; Trump offered at a roundtable in Dallas. No surprise there. A procession of senior Trump officials  #8212; among them his attorney general, acting homeland security secretary and national security adviser  #8212; have dismissed the notion that systemic racism infects police departments or the criminal justice system more broadly. Trump might have heard a different perspective in Dallas had he bothered to include the local police chief, sheriff or district attorney, all African American. The district attorney, John Creuzot, would have been enlightening.  #8220;Well, that #8217;s not reality, #8221; Creuzot told CNN #8217;s Chris Cuomo about Trump #8217;s bad-apples assessment.  #8220;I think any serious person who wants to be honest about these issues understands that there is systemic racism not only in police institutions but in most of our American institutions. #8221; Trump, ever unimpeded by confrontations with uncomfortable reality, blusters on. But the evidence of systemic racism, as my colleague Radley Balko has concluded after an examination of the academic literature,  #8220;isn #8217;t just convincing  #8212; it #8217;s overwhelming. #8221; For those who reflexively bristle at the term, Balko makes an important point: To declare the system racist is not to brand those who participate in it as intentionally, repugnantly, guilty of prejudice. It is to say that  #8220;we have systems and institutions that produce racially disparate outcomes, regardless of the intentions of the people who work within them. #8221; If you question the accuracy of that statement, please explain:  #9679; Why study after study shows that police disproportionately stop African American drivers and disproportionately search African American drivers after stopping them, even though they tend to find less contraband. A study published last month of nearly 100 million traffic stops by police departments nationwide found that black drivers were far more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. But, interestingly, the difference becomes smaller at night, when it #8217;s harder for police to see the race of the driver. Coincidence? I think not. Meanwhile, black and Hispanic drivers  #8220;were searched about twice as often as stopped white drivers #8221; #8212; even though black and, to an even greater extent, Hispanic drivers were less likely than whites to be found with drugs.  #9679; Why a study of police-shooting databasespublished by the National Academy of Sciences found that African American men were about two and a half times more likely than white men to be killed by police.  #8220;Men of color face a non-trivial lifetime risk of being killed by police, #8221; the authors wrote. For African American men, the lifetime risk of dying at the hands of police was 1 in 1,000. The Post #8217;s own comprehensive examination of police shootings showed that black Americans account for just 13 percent of the population but one-fourth of shooting victims. Among unarmed victims, the disparity was even greater: More than one-third of those fatally shot were black.  #9679; Why African Americans are far more likely to be arrested for petty crimes. A 2018 study exposed  #8220;profound racial disparity in the misdemeanor arrest rate for most  #8212; but not all  #8212; offense types. #8221; The black arrest rate was at least twice as high as that for whites for disorderly conduct, drug possession, simple assault, theft, vagrancy and vandalism. A 2020 study of marijuana possession arrests by the American Civil Liberties Union concluded that even in an era of legalization and decriminalization, there were  #8220;stark racial disparities #8221; in possession arrests, with a black person more than three and a half times more likely to be arrested for possession than a white person, even though rates of usage are similar. The disparities exist  #8220;across the country, in every state, in counties large and small, urban and rural, wealthy and poor, and with large and small black populations. #8221; This is just one aspect of a broader problem of racial disparities in our criminal justice system, from the use of cash bail and pretrial detention to jury selection to plea bargaining to sentencing to parole and pardons. Proving systemic bias is complex, and there is evidence suggesting, for example, that class disparities play a significant role in explaining the disparate results. A 2018 analysis published by the left-leaning People #8217;s Policy Project concluded that  #8220;mass incarceration in the United States is primarily a system of locking up lower-class men  #8212; one which ends up disproportionately imprisoning black men, since they are far more likely to be lower class than white men. #8221; A 2019 study by Boston University researchers found that black men were far more likely to be shot by police in predominantly African American neighborhoods than in less racially segregated neighborhoods. And conservative writers such as the Manhattan Institute #8217;s Heather Mac Donald assert that evidence of disparities in police shootings fail to take into account  #8220;crime rates and civilian behavior before and during interactions with police. #8221; None of this proves the absence of a systemic problem  #8212; it suggests a deeper one, a matter of entrenched and extreme inequality that goes beyond the criminal justice system itself to the broader questions of lingering racial inequities in the United States. But go ahead, Mr. President, you worry about those apples, and ignore the rot in the orchard."</TEXT>

Police brutality has even been publicly endorsed. Let #8217;s return to a gathering of law enforcement officers at Suffolk County Community College on New York #8217;s Long Island on July 28, 2017, where the main speaker was giving advice to police on how to treat people who #8217;ve been arrested.  #8220;When you guys put somebody in the car and you #8217;re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? #8221; the speaker said, mimicking the motion of police shielding a suspect #8217;s head to keep it from bumping against the squad car.  #8220;Like, don #8217;t hit their head and they #8217;ve just killed somebody  #8212; don #8217;t hit their head, #8221; the speaker continued.  #8220;I said, you can take the hand away, okay? #8221; Cops standing behind the speaker applauded, and some smiled and chuckled when the speaker turned to face them. Others in the audience also cheered and applauded. Who was at the lectern giving cops a green light to use unnecessary force? Who was encouraging them to be rough with people they arrest? Who suggested it is okay for police to use more force than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of a suspect  #8212; something that is irresponsible, unprofessional and illegal? Opinion | Trump's 'law and order' tendencies are straight out of Nixon's 1960s As President Trump threatens to unleash the military on American cities roiled in civil unrest, it's clear that he's embracing his inner Nixon. (Joshua Carroll, Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post) The speaker was Donald Trump, the president of the United States. You think some of the cops who are hitting, kicking and kneeling on the necks of black men and women don #8217;t still have Trump #8217;s advice ringing in their ears? Trump was rebuked by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and law enforcement officials around the country who have been trying to build confidence and trust between cops and the African American community. The Suffolk County Police said on Twitter:  #8220;As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners. #8221; That criticism of Trump was as effective as an umbrella in a hurricane. He was at it again this week. A few days ago, Trump saw what tens of millions in the country also witnessed via cellphone video: two cops in Buffalo shoving backward a 75-year-old protester, later identified as longtime peace advocate Martin Gugino, who fell and cracked his head on the ground. With Gugino lying motionless, blood seeping from his ear, the officers who pushed him walked away and others kept up their pace. Gugino #8217;s mistreatment was enough for the Erie County, N.Y., district attorney to charge the officers with felony assault. The officers pleaded not guilty. The video wasn #8217;t enough, however, to convince the president.  #8220;Martin Gugino, #8221; Trump tweeted,  #8220;fell harder than was pushed #8221;  #8212; whatever in the world that means. Trump also suggested, without evidence, that Gugino  #8220;could be an ANTIFA provocateur. #8221;  #8220;Could be a set up? #8221; Trump tweeted. Trump #8217;s slimy charge rested upon a baseless conspiracy theory. Trump, however, uses conspiracy theories the way he uses lies: to distract and serve his own twisted purposes. He smeared Gugino because he wanted to protect bad cops. Trump #8217;s love for the use of force was also revealed this week at a roundtable on policing and race in Dallas. He used the occasion to describe the use of tear gas and other force against protesters in Minneapolis as a  #8220;beautiful scene. #8221; As for the National Guard #8217;s moves against the crowd? It was, gushed Trump,  #8220;like a knife cutting butter. #8221; With Trump, it #8217;s all about keeping his law-and-order base happy. That is the same reason Trump caters to the Old Confederacy.  #8220;My administration will not even consider the renaming #8221; of military facilities named for Confederate military figures, Trump declared in a stout defense of Confederate generals who betrayed the United States and fought on behalf of preserving slavery. He also has a deaf ear or a closed mind when it comes to healing our divided country. Trump is going to Tulsa next week for a reelection campaign rally. Tulsa is also the site of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, where a white mob descended on the Oklahoma city #8217;s affluent black Greenwood district, referred to as Black Wall Street, and killed hundreds. The riot started over rumors that a black teenager had sexually assaulted a white woman. Trump also lands on June 19, or  #8220;Juneteenth, #8221; one of the oldest dates of national commemoration for the end of slavery. Tulsa #8217;s dark, racist history and Juneteenth are events that rest in the heart of the black experience in America. And Trump, the most racist president in modern American history, chooses that locale to feed his narcissism. But if Trump would revel in the gassing of protesters, and encourage the mistreatment of people in custody, why wouldn #8217;t he celebrate in a place where white supremacy had its most abominable hour?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The horror leaps off the screen as state troopers, wielding whips and billy clubs, mercilessly beat peaceful civil rights demonstrators who have made their way reverently across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. In portraying the assault on the March 7, 1965, demonstration in all its brutality, the 2014 movie  #8220;Selma #8221; makes clear why that day is forever known as  #8220;Bloody Sunday. #8221; And by interspersing the portrayal of violence with scenes of Americans recoiling in revulsion as their television sets bring the cruelty into their living rooms, the film tells an additional truth: A single, traumatic event can change minds, move consciences and galvanize a nation. Five months after Bloody Sunday, on Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law. There are moments when the impossible suddenly becomes possible. Our time must be one of them. The sheer evil of George Floyd #8217;s killing on May 25, which was captured by cellphone and broadcast to the world, has transformed us in ways no one anticipated on May 24. A case can be made that the ground was prepared by a growing revulsion over President Trump #8217;s racist divisiveness and the progressive impulses of a diverse younger generation. But what police officer Derek Chauvin did to Floyd brought home to white Americans the truth of African American vulnerability and oppression in a way that could not be pushed aside.  #8220;We saw a person martyred before our very eyes, #8221; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a group of columnists last week.  #8220;We saw it. We didn #8217;t hear about it. It wasn #8217;t reported. We didn #8217;t see a film later. We saw a person martyred before our very eyes: eight minutes and 46 seconds. It #8217;s a long time. It #8217;s a long time. . #8201;. #8201;. That is not who Americans think we are. #8221; That is not who Americans think we are. Of course, as Pelosi suggested later, it should not have taken that video to remind white Americans that the events  #8220;before our very eyes #8221; were very much part of the United States that African Americans have always known. It should not have taken Bloody Sunday to create a sense of urgency for voting rights, either. But what will we do with this moment? We should bear in mind that white Americans have a history of giving up the fight for racial justice in ways that African Americans cannot. Reconstruction of the South after the Civil War was demolished by the white terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan along with white reaction and indifference in the North. The great progress toward racial equality of the mid-1960s was followed by a long backlash that began later in the decade and culminated in Trump #8217;s ascent. Still, it matters that Trump is pulling all the traditional backlash levers  #8212; and, so far, nothing is happening. He shouts on Twitter about  #8220;LAW  amp; ORDER!, #8221; speaks of  #8220;dominating #8221; the streets and defends Confederate monuments as  #8220;heritage, #8221; never noting that the  #8220;heritage #8221; in question is white supremacy, the monuments having been erected to celebrate the rise of Jim Crow or, later, to resist dismantling it. Yet those who cowered before Trump (the National Football League comes to mind) are cowering no longer. Arguments for Confederate symbols that seemed insurmountable only weeks ago are suddenly deemed tone-deaf as the military expresses openness to removing the names of Confederate leaders from its bases and NASCAR bans the Confederate flag. Do not underestimate the importance of this: The durability of nostalgia for the Confederacy is a mark of our 155-year failure to declare the issues of the Civil War as finally settled. But the coming months are critical as the news turns inevitably back to the resurgence of the novel coronavirus. Former vice president Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress have an obligation to turn the shock of moral recognition from Floyd #8217;s murder into a movement for a new community. Precisely because Biden is widely seen as a traditional figure of restoration, he has been given a historic opportunity to argue that restoration demands change. To become  #8220;who we think we are, #8221; Americans must break decisively not only with the Trumpian present but also with the long history of reaction the president represents. More than that: Biden can make the case, as he has begun to, that those who genuinely seek, yes, law and order must embrace justice and reform as the only alternatives to fragmentation and ongoing chaos. We will continue to be tormented, as the Atlantic #8217;s Adam Serwer observed, as long as we refuse to deal comprehensively with our legacy of racism.  #8220;No justice, no peace #8221; is not just a slogan. It is a truthful statement. For the first time in a long time, a large majority of Americans, moved by realities they can no longer deny, seem ready to sign up."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "White House image-makers often strive to create iconic moments for presidents, but sometimes history refuses to cooperate. George W. Bush #8217;s  #8220;Mission Accomplished #8221; speech on an aircraft carrier, for instance, ultimately came to enshrine his propagandizing about a needless war that spiraled into the greatest U.S. foreign policy disaster in recent times. Disturbing new details are emerging about the violent crackdown on protesters that preceded President Trump #8217;s Bible photo op near the White House. What was supposed to capture Trump bravely standing up for  #8220;law and order #8221; is rapidly coming to typify his megalomania, his terror of looking weak, and  #8212; perversely enough  #8212; his profound contempt for the rule of law. The Post has assembled a remarkable reconstruction of the decision-making behind the crackdown, which cleared the way for Trump #8217;s walk across Lafayette Square to a nearby church. It suggests the violations of protesters #8217; rights were even more serious than we previously thought. First, we need to foreground a crucial fact: Trump and his handlers have gone to extraordinary lengths to showcase this moment as a great triumph. Now that new details suggest serious abuses behind it  #8212; and now that senior officials are rapidly distancing themselves from it  #8212; that fact looks a whole lot worse. At the core of the new Post report are two questions: Who issued the order to clear away the protesters, and to what degree was it linked to the decision to hold that photo op? The administration has defended itself by claiming the two were not linked, and that the removal action carried out a decision to expand the security perimeter around the White House that had been made in advance. But numerous other officials, including the chiefs of the D.C. police and National Guard Bureau, have now challenged this claim. They say they had no advance notice that the U.S. Park Police would commence forcible removal. That undercuts the notion that it was part of a pre-planned effort. What #8217;s more, at the time, Trump was in a rage inside the White House about reports that he was hunkered down, the report documents. White House officials were discussing expanding the perimeter, but they were also discussing holding an event to showcase Trump in control  #8212; the visit to the church. Officials disputing the administration #8217;s account told The Post that, even if the perimeter expansion had been discussed, there was never any firm indication of a time when it would happen. And then, right after Trump made the decision to walk to the church, this was relayed to the Secret Service on the ground, whereupon the crackdown suddenly ensued, including chemical gassing and violent shoving with shields. That seems to support the very connection that the administration denies. But even though this still remains to be proved, there #8217;s still another revelation here: The clearing away of the protesters might have violated a 2015 court settlement between the Park Police and the Justice Department. That 2015 settlement set new rules for how federal law enforcement engages with protesters, requiring three audible warnings about pending dispersal, plus the identification of avenues for protesters to disperse themselves peacefully. The Post #8217;s reconstruction of events concludes that those things almost surely didn #8217;t happen. Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, says there was already a strong case that the protesters #8217; First Amendment rights were violated.  #8220;The government can impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on speech in public forums, and in some circumstances it can clear protesters to protect public safety or the safety of public officials, #8221; Jaffer told me.  #8220;But the First Amendment requires that the restrictions be reasonable, #8221; Jaffer said.  #8220;They went from zero to 60 in a matter of seconds. #8221; The 2015 settlement more clearly defined what law enforcement must do to protect protesters #8217; rights in a situation like this, yet this appears to have been violated as well, Jaffer continued. Jaffer said the settlement  #8220;seems to have recognized" the First Amendment rights of protesters to gather in public forums, and "placed specific limits on the government #8217;s authority to use force and other aggressive tactics in this kind of context. #8221;  #8220;These limits were totally disregarded here, #8221; Jaffer said. Now let #8217;s recall that Trump #8217;s top image-makers went to great lengths to promote what happened as a glorious triumph. After the event, a senior Trump campaign operative tweeted out a photo of Trump striding through the area. The White House #8217;s official Twitter feed also promoted a propagandistic video of the episode. Even worse, as Politico reported, these efforts were part of a broader push to highlight Trump #8217;s threat to use the military to quell protests  #8212; which Trump had threatened in a speech just before his heroic walk  #8212; in hopes that it would  #8220;win over seniors and suburban women. #8221; Since then this has imploded spectacularly. The defense secretary distanced himself from Trump #8217;s threats. And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff publicly apologized for joining the walk with Trump, even issuing an extraordinary reaffirmation of the military #8217;s commitment to the principles of the Constitution. In other words, this episode stands as the precipitating moment at which some of the darkest and most seminal truths about the Trump presidency emerged. Trump #8217;s abuses led military officials to feel the need to signal to the country that something is very wrong, that our values and ideals are under serious threat. We are now learning that the crackdown might have been more tightly tied to Trump #8217;s desire to stage a messianic and megalomaniacal photo op than previously known  #8212; and that the abuses undertaken to facilitate it might have been worse than we thought. A full reckoning with this episode is urgently needed. When that happens, it will indeed stand as an iconic moment of the Trump presidency  #8212; yet not at all how he and his spinners had hoped."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "As a first-class narcissist, President Trump has insisted he is the healthiest president ever, as his former physician comically represented to the American people. In reality, signs of ill health and/or aging are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. There was his mysterious trip to Walter Reed, which he would have us believe was part of an early annual exam. (That would mean it wasn #8217;t annual, right?) There have been numerous episodes of slurred or garbled speech, captured and shared on social media. (This is quite apart from his increasingly incoherent, fragmented verbal communication, a juicy subject for @sarahcpr and other comics.) On Saturday, at his address at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., he needed two hands to sip a glass of water. His tottering, baby steps down a ramp while exiting was the latest episode in which he seemed to have trouble navigating uneven footing. As comments and snickering spread around the Internet, Trump dashed off an unconvincing tweet:  #10004; @realDonaldTrump  #8220;The ramp that I descended after my West Point Commencement speech was very long  amp; steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery. The last thing I was going to do is  #8220;fall #8221; for the Fake News to have fun with. Final ten feet I ran down to level ground. Momentum! #8221; Anyone watching the address could see it was a sunny, dry day. Moreover, the general at his side seemed to have no trouble at all walking down the ramp. (The president bounced on the last couple of steps, not the  #8220;final ten feet. #8221;) We will likely never know until he is out of the White House what mental and/or physical ailments may afflict him. Two things are clear, however. First, it is an entirely legitimate topic for the campaign. The media should not relent in asking questions and demanding to speak with his doctors. Second, former vice president Joe Biden, a spry and fit 77-year-old, would be foolish not to mention it during the campaign. Trump increasingly seems like he is from another era, not someone who can make America great, but rather someone who never left the 1950s. His doddering appearance and faltering speech only add to the image of a man fading before our eyes. Ironically, Trump is more than willing to create health hazards for himself and others. His infamous refusal to wear a mask puts aides and visitors at risk while increasing the chance he might contract the coronavirus. His insistence on holding a mass indoor rally with people who scorn mask-wearing, the first in Tulsa, has now become the focus of health officials. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in an interview with ABC News #8217;s Jonathan Karl that masks should be worn. He said that  #8220;the best way that you can avoid  #8212; either acquiring or transmitting infection  #8212; is to avoid crowded places, to wear a mask whenever you #8217;re outside. And if you can do both, avoid the congregation of people and do the mask, that #8217;s great. #8221; He added,  #8220;If you #8217;re going to be in a situation where  #8212; beyond your control there #8217;s a lot of people around you  #8212; make sure you wear a mask. #8221; Meanwhile, the Tulsa World reports,  #8220;Expressing concerns about covid-19 #8217;s increasing spread, the Tulsa City-County Health Department #8217;s director said he wishes the campaign rally for President Donald Trump at the BOK Center on June 20 would be pushed back to a later date. #8221; Noting that cases of coronavirus have been rising, Bruce Dart is desperately and appropriately trying to protect both attendees and the president:  #8220;COVID is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently, #8221; Dart said.  #8220;I wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn #8217;t as large a concern as it is today. #8221; Dart said his concern stems from a sudden spike in cases he said likely comes from a combination of factors, but not increased testing. Health department data shows Tulsa County #8217;s 7-day rolling average for COVID-19 cases has risen from 24.9 cases on June 7 to 51.4 as of Friday. . . .  #8220;There was a funeral that had a large attendance and we #8217;re finding quite a few cases from that, #8221; Dart said.  #8220;But other than that, it #8217;s broad community spread from being out in the community and not taking those necessary precautions we #8217;ve been talking about. #8221; Trump is unlikely to listen. His massive ego must be fed, his thirst for applause from his cult quenched. In short, Trump #8217;s own health may be deteriorating, but, more important, he is willing to put thousands of Americans at risk. Even in ordinary times a president this reckless would be a danger. Given the pandemic, Trump #8217;s willingness to help spread the virus is reason enough to vote him out. It would be a lifesaving service for those he would continue to expose."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "After all these years, Hertz is No. 1 again. Not in market share: The car-rental company is a distant second to Enterprise. But Hertz has become Exhibit #1 of the madness that has been sweeping the stock market in these times of Covid-19  #8212; a madness that may do considerable harm, not because stock prices themselves matter all that much, but because Donald Trump and his minions treat the stock market as a measure of their success. About Hertz: Last month the company, which is deeply in debt and has seen its business plunge amid the pandemic, filed for Chapter 11 protection. This is a form of bankruptcy that keeps a company operating by restructuring its debts. But while companies that enter Chapter 11 often survive, their stockholders are normally wiped out. So Hertz stock should have become more or less worthless. Sure enough, Hertz #8217;s stock price fell from more than $20 in February to less than $1 in early June. But then a funny thing happened: Investors suddenly piled into the stock, driving it up by more than 500 percent. And Hertz  #8212; in bankruptcy!  #8212; announced plans to raise money by selling more stock. The Hertz story was just one example of a broader phenomenon. The run-up in stock prices that took place between mid-May and Thursday #8217;s sudden plummet was driven, to an important extent, by investors rushing into very dubious companies  #8212; what one observer called a  #8220;flight to crap. #8221; Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. Stock markets never bear much relationship to the real economy, but these days they don #8217;t seem to have much to do with reality in general. So what is going on in the market? Think of it as a play in three acts (so far). The first act was the huge decline that markets experienced as the threat from Covid-19 became clear. This decline reflected justified concerns about future profits, but it also reflected a developing financial crisis: For a few weeks credit markets were seizing up pretty much the same way they did in 2008. The Federal Reserve, however, has been there and done that. It moved quickly, buying bonds, establishing special lending facilities, and essentially doing whatever it took to lubricate markets and keep money flowing freely. The result was the second act of the play, a stock rebound that made up about half of the losses from the initial plunge. Up to that point the behavior of stock prices generally made sense. But then came the third act, a surge in prices that eliminated most of the previous losses and drove the Nasdaq to a new high. And this surge bore all the usual signs of a bubble. Robert Shiller, the world #8217;s leading expert on such things, has pointed out that asset bubbles are, in effect, naturally occurring Ponzi schemes. Early investors see big gains because later investors drive prices up, inducing more people to buy in, and so on; the party continues until something cuts off the flow of new money, and suddenly everything crashes. So it was with the recent stock surge. Encouraged by the Fed-induced recovery of stocks from their March lows, some investors began buying. Their optimism became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as initial gains led more cautious investors to join in, driven by FOMO  #8212; fear of missing out. It looked a lot like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, except on a vastly accelerated timetable. Although there is some dispute about how important they were, most of the evidence suggests that a major role in this apparent bubble was played by small investors  #8212;  #8220;retail bros #8221;  #8212; pursuing get-rich-quick dreams. Some of these exuberant investors were people who normally bet on sports and were looking for an alternative source of excitement. And as the Hertz example shows, they didn #8217;t care much about quality. Why didn #8217;t large investors offset this apparent irrational exuberance by selling stocks? As John Maynard Keynes argued long ago, staid investors who usually stabilize the market tend to abdicate judgment in  #8220;abnormal times. #8221; We are, you might say, in a time when the smart money lacks all conviction, while the dumb money is filled with a passionate intensity. And now the bubble may  #8212; may  #8212; be bursting. But does any of this matter? In a direct sense, not much. Stock prices surely have some impact on business investment and consumer spending, but these effects are probably small. But the Trump team sees stock prices as the ultimate measure of policy success. Back in 2007  #8212; on the eve of the Great Recession  #8212; Larry Kudlow, who is now Trump #8217;s top economist, declared that things were going great, because the market was up, and stock prices are  #8220;the best barometer of the health, wealth and security of a nation. #8221; So the Trumpists took the rising market as validation for everything they were doing  #8212; their push for early reopening even though the coronavirus was by no means contained, their opposition to further relief for unemployed workers. In other words, the irrational exuberance of the retail bros may have enabled the irresponsibility of an administration that didn #8217;t want to deal with reality in the first place. And while falling stocks may provoke a reconsideration, a lot of damage has already been done."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump #8217;s campaign is in free fall. New polling from released Tuesday showed he is 16 points behind former vice president Joe Biden in Michigan. The Detroit Free Press reported: 'Two weeks ago, EPIC-MRA of Lansing, a polling firm that does work for the Free Press, released a survey showing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, leading Trump 53%-41% in Michigan, a 12-point edge. But a second poll, started on May 31, a day after the first poll began, and concluded a day later than the first poll, on June 4, showed Biden leading Trump 55%-39% in Michigan, a 16-point margin.' A stunning 61 percent of respondents in the Michigan poll report having a negative view of Trump. And the bad news doesn #8217;t end there: A Democratic Public Policy Polling survey shows him trailing Biden by two points  #8212; in Georgia. The Daily Kos/Civiqs poll had him behind Biden by a 49-to-45 margin  #8212; in Arizona. To make matters worse, his campaign has been spending loads of money in many of the states where he is behind. The Associated Press reports,  #8220;President Donald Trump #8217;s campaign manager warned in late spring that his juggernaut political operation  #8212; the  #8216;Death Star, #8217; he called it  #8212; was about to start  #8216;pressing FIRE #8217; for the first time. #8221; Well, he did fire to the tune of $24 million in six battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Polling continues to show him losing in every one of these, in some cases (e.g., Michigan) by large margins. Was Trump firing blanks, or would the polling have been even worse without the ad spending? Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) whined,  #8220;That #8217;s the part that #8217;s frustrating. It #8217;s headed back in the right direction, but then every once in a while the message gets off track from the good things that he and his team are doing. #8221; What were the good things? The pandemic death count? His attack on peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square? It #8217;s hard to know for sure, but it seems Trump is bleeding money with little to show for it. As the AP reports,  #8220;The president spent almost $5.6 million on television and online advertising in Florida between April 26 and June 6. #8221; In the latest polls from TIPP taken between June 9 and 11, he trails in Florida by 10 points or more; before that, polls from May showed him losing by three points. Trump and his advisers can lie to themselves that all these polls are wrong, but donors and Republican candidates are going to figure out Trump #8217;s campaign is in real trouble. Trump will almost certainly not take responsibility for his own mishandling of the pandemic (which crashed the economy) or his disastrous response to George Floyd #8217;s murder. When in doubt, Trump will find someone to fire. That might be campaign manager Brad Parscale or even his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Clearheaded observers will recognize that Trump is overexposed, so his ads do not pack much punch. But more important, the free media he has garnered  #8212; including the incident at Lafayette Square and his feeble appearance at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.  #8212; is overwhelmingly negative. Furthermore, with tens of millions of Americans still unemployed, his Pollyanna ads and empty boasts about  #8220;successes #8221; ring hollow. Keep in mind a few points: First, the polls show the state of the race now, not in November. Given how dreadful the results, however, Trump may not want to bet Parscale can turn things around and may push for a change in the campaign. (The problem, of course, is Trump, but he remains in total denial.) Second, Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised a ton of money last month (more than $80 million) and, aside from digital ads, haven #8217;t spent much money, in large part because the presumptive nominee has not been traveling around the country (although he did go to Houston to meet with Floyd #8217;s family and has made several trips to Pennsylvania). Finally, the polling and ad spending seem to bolster my longtime suspicion that money is overrated in national politics. You need enough, but you don #8217;t need more than the other guy. What you need is a decent record and candidate, neither of which Republicans have."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump and his officials have perverted and manipulated the machinery of government to place his personal interests above those of the nation so many times that you simply cannot grant the benefit of the doubt to any new moves in this direction. The news that Trump #8217;s Justice Department is suing to block the publication of John Bolton #8217;s book falls into this category. It #8217;s a complicated situation, and there #8217;s a lot we still don #8217;t know about it. But the already known facts suggest something seriously untoward is happening here. And this dispute raises important larger issues, about Trump #8217;s abuses of power and the reforms need to prevent future abuses. The immediate question is whether the Trump administration is abusing the declassification system to protect the president. What #8217;s at stake is whether this constitutes more manipulation of the machinery of government to serve corrupt ends. The lawsuit from the Justice Department seeks to block Bolton, Trump #8217;s former national security adviser, from publishing his new memoir, on the grounds that it still contains classified information that could compromise national security. We know Trump wants to block publication in part because the book will reveal more details about his impeachable conduct toward Ukraine and, possibly, other ways Trump perverted national security policy for reelection purposes. The lawsuit accuses Bolton of violating the non-disclosure agreement he signed as a condition of employment. It claims Bolton  #8220;unilaterally #8221; cut short the process by which books are reviewed for classified information. The real issue here is what actually did happen during that process, and whether the administration corrupted it on Trump #8217;s behalf. How this process is supposed to work Typically, when an author wants to publish a book with potentially classified information, National Security Council officials review the manuscript and enter a dialogue with the author, who edits the book until concerns are satisfied. Those officials are supposed to act in good faith. They are supposed to ask whether the information in question legitimately should or should not be classified and whether divulging it legitimately would or would not harm the national interest. In this case, the evidence suggests bad faith infected the process. The lawsuit itself recounts that one NSC official reviewed the book and, after revisions by Bolton, cleared it. A second official then undertook to review it, the lawsuit says. As time passed, Bolton #8217;s lawyer repeatedly inquired as to what was going on with that review, the lawsuit itself recounts. Again and again, an NSC official informed him that the process remained ongoing and that no new information was available. Bolton concluded that the process was not unfolding in good faith, the New York Times reports, and moved forward with publication. The lawsuit #8217;s complaint insists the process was ongoing according to protocol. But the complaint justifies the delay unconvincingly. It notes that the official doing the second review had a  #8220;broader base of knowledge #8221; to identify what shouldn #8217;t have been published, a thin rationale. Problems with the account In an interview, Joshua Geltzer, a senior NSC official from 2015 to 2017, pointed to serious problems with this account. Geltzer noted that a career government official with experience in this sort of vetting did the first review, and that she cleared the book after an extensive process. It was only after that, Geltzer pointed out, that the delays suddenly started taking place without explanation. And as Geltzer also noted, the official doing that second vetting  #8212; Michael Ellis, the NSC #8217;s senior director for intelligence  #8212; is a political appointee. Importantly, Geltzer points out, the lawsuit itself acknowledges that this second review took place  #8220;at the request #8221; of the current national security adviser, Robert O #8217;Brien.  #8220;The claim by the government that the process was still ongoing does not feel in good faith, #8221; Geltzer told me.  #8220;The official with genuine expertise had already weighed in. Bolton seemed to be getting the runaround with the goal of simply delay. #8221; What might have happened here?  #8220;We know Trump doesn #8217;t want this book to see the light of day, #8221; Geltzer said.  #8220;It seems natural to infer that O #8217;Brien wanted to ensure the president got his way. #8221; It may be true that Bolton did violate his non-disclosure agreement. But that does not exonerate the government #8217;s handling of this process. Murky complications One complication here concerns typical Beltway murkiness, this time around the status of former government officials who reenter the private sector and want to publicly recount their experiences. That act might be undertaken for self-interested purposes, but it constitutes protected speech and has a clear public-interest dimension. As Geltzer explained, the process is meant to create a way to allow former officials to do this, for good reasons, while also protecting the country from damaging disclosures. So the process envisions a  #8220;scalpel, not a sledgehammer #8221; approach to paring out classified info. But here the administration appears to be wielding a sledgehammer.  #8220;The idea that this whole book is being held up after an extensive process feels like an abuse of power, #8221; Geltzer told me, adding that a cardinal principle of the classification process is that it must not be used to protect officials from  #8220;embarrassment. #8221; This whole process itself has grown problematic. As many former officials have claimed, it is plagued by vague standards and a lack of transparency that render it easily abused to suppress information for political purposes. It doesn #8217;t matter if Bolton #8217;s views are loathsome (which they are), or that Bolton should have disclosed information during impeachment (which he should have). At issue is something much bigger: whether Trump and/or his loyalists are manipulating a process designed to balance competing public-interest imperatives, all to protect him politically. Given all we #8217;ve seen from Trump, and given the thinness of this lawsuit #8217;s account, that seems more likely than not. And this is crying out for more scrutiny."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: Let #8217;s be blunt: Trump has had strange episodes of slurred or nonsensical speech and refuses to be transparent about his trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., last November. The voters have every right to know whether the president is well enough to perform his duties. Despite his best efforts to suggest former vice president Joe Biden has  #8220;lost a step, #8221; it is Trump who seems to be deteriorating. John Gartner, a psychologist and a former assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, wrote last year in USA Today that there are two signs of language skills deteriorating.  #8220;Semantic paraphasia #8221; means you substitute an incorrect word for a correct one. For example, when Trump discussed the  #8220;origins #8221; of the Mueller investigation, he said:  #8220;I hope they now go and take a look at the oranges, the oranges of that investigation, the beginnings of that investigation. #8221; AD The second, Gartner explains, is  #8220;phonemic paraphasia, #8221; or the substitution of one word with a similar sounding non-word. For example, calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  #8220;Betanyahu #8221; or saying  #8220;bigly #8221; instead of  #8220;big league. #8221; Such slip-ups are not proof of cognitive decline, but Gartner says they can be linked to moderate to severe stages of Alzheimer #8217;s. Discussing the subject is not a matter of mocking the president or those with disabilities. It is about Trump being transparent about his health and allowing the voters to decide. Moreover, if Trump #8217;s condition is deteriorating under the stress of the presidency and his polling collapse, that would be important to know. This is not an attempt to medicalize his bad behavior. He can be judged on his actions and his words, but voters asked to reelect him also have a right to know about his health. That brings us to another issue. The Lincoln Project ad elevates another concern: the lack of sustained reporting and questioning about Trump #8217;s mental and physical state. Why does the White House press corps not do a better job of conveying Trump #8217;s behavior, for example, when his speech short-circuits or when he wildly rants about his opponents and litters his remarks with non sequiturs? This is analogous to refusing to call his lies  #8220;lies #8221;; when we do not call things for what they are, we conceal the truth; that is, we help perpetuate the lie that Trump #8217;s conduct is normal. AD In a vain effort to remain  #8220;neutral #8221; or to avoid diagnosing the president without a medical license, reports of his appearances often fail to convey just how emotionally unhinged and incoherent he appears. When TV producers lift a clip of Trump #8217;s remarks or a reporter quotes a line in print, they (unintentionally perhaps) help him sound more normal and collected than he really is. It is only when you see the entire performance or read a complete transcript (which very few voters have the time or inclination to do) that one can appreciate how downright weird he seems. Trump #8217;s speech defects should be described just as the media does for his physical conduct. If the media can deconstruct his excuses for his  #8220;baby steps #8221; down a ramp at West Point over the weekend (e.g., the ramp at West Point was not slippery), they can diagram and dissect his sentences to explain why he makes no sense. Once more, the Lincoln Project #8217;s fearlessness and its willingness to say out loud what we all whisper about provide a great service. It is long past time to have an honest discussion about the president. The topic shouldn #8217;t be just in ads but on the front page of every newspaper and near the top of every newscast."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "When red-state governors threw open the doors of businesses and public venues a few weeks ago  #8212; before infection rates dropped and without a robust testing or tracing system and strict social-distancing guidelines  #8212; the result was entirely predictable. Red-state governors boasted that they had a better idea than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They insisted they were smarter and tougher than governors following a go-slow approach. On May 19, I wrote:  #8220;If premature, rash and uninformed decision-making leads to unnecessary deaths, governors, candidly, will have blood on their hands. And the country will have a catastrophe in the making. #8221; That is precisely what happened. The Post reports:  #8220;Texas and its largest city, Houston  #8212; the fourth biggest in the country  #8212; are reaching new peaks in coronavirus hospitalizations amid a wave of warnings from officials that infections in many states are surging. #8221; Hospitalizations in Texas reached more than 2,200 on Saturday. But it #8217;s not just Texas. The Post notes that  #8220;hospitalizations related to the virus are up more than 10 percent since Memorial Day in at least 10 states  #8212; more than 120 percent in Arkansas and nearly 75 percent in Arizona." Those three red states are paying the price for their governors #8217; arrogant and reckless disregard of expert advice. The red-state governors, who curried favor with President Trump by putting the economy over health, must be held accountable for the horrible result. It may be that both bad policy and resistance to mask-wearing (now a staple of MAGA tribal identity) have hurt Trump #8217;s most loyal supporters. The Economist reports that in 2016 Trump won 87 percent of the nearly 1,300 counties where the disease is appearing for the first time in the seven weeks leading up to June 7. In addition,  #8220;As the disease spreads, it touches different sorts of people in different sorts of places. ... By the end of May, more than half the residents of newly infected counties lived in outer suburbs, smaller towns or rural areas. Almost half of those counties were in the South. #8221; In Arkansas (home to Trump sycophant Sen. Tom Cotton), a debacle is unfolding. The Daily Beast reports that  #8220;there are few states whose experience of the coronavirus pandemic has shifted more radically in recent weeks than Arkansas. On Friday, the state reported that there were 731 new cases, a record increase. Those numbers brought the cumulative total there to 11,547, of which 3,764 were active. At last count, 176 people had died from the virus. #8221; Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) might regret bragging that he succeeded in keeping his state largely open because of  #8220;the tenacity, grit and heart of our residents. #8221; There are a number of takeaways here. First, Republicans might not be so cavalier about the virus and so dismissive about wearing masks when the pandemic is no longer just a New York or New Jersey problem. Ignoring, denying and minimizing the coronavirus was self-destructive. It remains to be seen whether Republicans will rethink their attitudes, reevaluate their faith in science-denying Republican leaders and revise their behavior as the hospitalization and death rates soar. Second, should red states such as Texas need to shut down again, the political damage to Republicans and the damage to their economies could be severe. There is something to be said for listening to experts and devising a data-driven approach to a global pandemic. Third, as Trump #8217;s most loyal supporters experience an increase in infections, his big rallies and his planned convention in Florida might seem less like a love-fest and more like an abusive, codependent relationship. Seriously, haven #8217;t his disinformation, obsession with the stock market and quack medical suggestions done enough damage?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT [shortened for length]: "Advisers and allies say the president #8217;s repeated acts of self-destruction have significantly damaged his re-election prospects, and yet he appears mostly unable, or unwilling, to curtail them. In a recent meeting with his top political advisers, President Trump was impatient as they warned him that he was on a path to defeat in November if he continued his incendiary behavior in public and on Twitter. Days earlier, Mr. Trump had sparked alarm by responding to protests over police brutality with a threat that  #8220;when the looting starts, the shooting starts. #8221; Mr. Trump pushed back against his aides.  #8220;I have to be myself, #8221; he replied, according to three people familiar with the meeting. A few hours later, he posted on Twitter a letter from his former personal lawyer describing some of the protesters as  #8220;terrorists. #8221; In those moments, and in repeated ones since then, the president #8217;s customary defiance has been suffused with a heightened sense of agitation as he confronts a series of external crises he has failed to contain, or has exacerbated, according to people close to him. They say his repeated acts of political self-sabotage  #8212; a widely denounced photo-op at a church for which peaceful protesters were forcibly removed, a threat to use the American military to quell protests  #8212; have significantly damaged his re-election prospects, and yet he appears mostly unable, or unwilling, to curtail them. Mr. Trump doesn #8217;t want to be seen as a  #8220;loser, #8221; a label he detests, in the campaign against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And some advisers believe Mr. Trump #8217;s taste for battle will return in the fall, when the general election fight is more engaged. But for now, they said, the president is acting trapped and defensive, and his self-destructive behavior has been so out of step for an incumbent in an election year that many advisers wonder if he is truly interested in serving a second term. Rather than focus on plans and goals for another four years in office, Mr. Trump has been wallowing in self-pity about news coverage of him since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, people who have spoken with him said. He has told advisers that no matter what he does, he cannot get  #8220;good #8221; stories from the press, which has often been his primary interest.  #8220;These people, #8221; Mr. Trump has growled to advisers about reporters, throwing an expletive between the two words. He has complained that nothing he does is good enough, bristling at criticism that he hasn #8217;t sufficiently addressed the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by the police in Minneapolis. The remarks he made about Mr. Floyd when he attended the launch of the SpaceX shuttle should have been enough, the president told aides. Mr. Trump has also become consumed, once again, with leaks from the White House, demanding that officials find and prosecute those responsible for information getting out about his trip to the bunker beneath the White House during unruly protests. And while he has shown enthusiasm for resuming his trademark rallies, he has not seemed excited about the possibility of governing for four more years, people close to him said. He has set up villains to blame if he loses  #8212; China #8217;s mishandling of the coronavirus, the shutdown of the economy, and Democrats who he has told advisers will  #8220;steal #8221; the election from him. Aides acknowledged that he has always had difficulty controlling his behavior, which goes far beyond the bounds of traditional presidential conduct. His penchant for using racist language  #8212; such as the tweet about shooting looters  #8212; is something that has long defined and undercut his presidency. But his recent behavior and remarks, and his inability to move beyond them, strike advisers as different from his usual aberrations. The New York Times interviewed more than a dozen people who speak or interact with the president frequently, including current and former White House aides, campaign advisers, friends and associates. Most spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal White House affairs, and to avoid retribution. They would like to see him win again, but say they #8217;re struck by how his demeanor has shifted during this latest dire threat to his presidency. Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, said the serious challenges facing the country had thrust Mr. Trump into uncharted territory.  #8220;This is not something he #8217;s used to, #8221; Mr. King said in an interview.  #8220;Mueller, in a way, was easy, #8217; #8217; Mr. King added, referring to Mr. Trump #8217;s forceful pushback to the Russia inquiry conducted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.  #8220;It was a variation of what he #8217;s had to deal with his whole career. He #8217;s always fighting, and there #8217;s always at least 40 or 50 percent of people who start out on your side. #8221; But right now, Mr. King said,  #8220;this is different. #8221; In a statement, a White House spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, said,  #8220;The president is fully committed to serving a second term and building on and adding to his first-term accomplishments for the American people. #8221; One official, who would speak only about the administration #8217;s planning, claimed policy staff members were told just this week to come up with initiatives for 2021 and beyond. With the Russia investigation and impeachment, White House officials and others said, Mr. Trump was eager to fight, and did so fairly effectively. Now, they see his behavior as self-defeating, and his bursts of both anger and self-praise as futile against an invisible enemy like the virus and a protest movement he #8217;s shown little sympathy for.  #8220;He is the modern L.B.J., where everything has gone wrong and none of his skill sets are effective at what #8217;s gone wrong, #8221; said Anthony Scaramucci, who served as the White House communications director for one of the briefest periods on record  #8212; 11 days. Though he has since publicly denounced the president, Mr. Scaramucci has known Mr. Trump personally for years and remains friendly with some White House officials."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "With traumatic memories of election night 2016 still quite vivid, Americans praying for President Trump #8217;s eviction from the White House are not about to get complacent. However, it is hard not to look ahead and wonder: Is Trump going to drag the entire Republican Party under, and, if so, shouldn #8217;t they do something now to minimize the damage? We are more than 137 days until the election (or, if you prefer,  #8220;We #8217;re only 137 days from the election! #8221;), so it is way too early to suggest former vice president Joe Biden has the race locked up. There is plenty of time for him to stumble, or for Trump to find some way to slip through the electoral college. It nevertheless is fair to say that if something does not materially change for the better for Trump, he is going to get wiped out. FiveThirtyEight #8217;s weighted average shows Trump #8217;s net approval rating at nearly negative 15. It would be hard to find a legitimate pollster or strategist to argue that a president can win reelection with a 40 percent-to-55 percent approval deficit. Moreover, Trump #8217;s disapproval rating has floated up to the high 50s, meaning Trump will have to win back a significant chunk of the electorate that thinks he is doing a bad job. The head-to-head polls are just as awful for Trump. Biden is ahead by a whole lot in the most recent polls from CNN (14 points), CNBC (9 points), Reuters/Ipsos (13 points) and YouGov (10 points). For those who have grown accustomed to the conventional wisdom that we are a deeply and evenly divided country, these seem almost unbelievable. When you look deeper, however, you can see why Biden has opened up a large lead in national and key swing state polls. Take the CNBC poll (the least awful for Trump of the most recent batch), In which Trump is declining nationally and in battleground states in sync with ratings for his handling of the pandemic (where his disapproval has inched up three points).  #8220;He leads by 10 points nationally (51% Biden, 41% Trump), a 3-point gain since we last fielded, and he leads by 3 points in the battleground (48% Biden, 45% Trump), a 2-point gain since we last fielded, #8221; the pollsters found.  #8220;Biden is also leading in all six states in the battleground. #8221; Does anyone think Trump #8217;s handling of the pandemic will get better? Not with a president who insists on going to Oklahoma in the middle of a surge and who has moved his convention acceptance to Florida, where cases are also on the increase. (The Miami Herald editorial board writes,  #8220;How in the world will those tens of thousands of attendees be protected? Not well, not when they might have to sign a waiver freeing the party of liability should they catch COVID-19. Not, in an example of pretzel logic, when so many of their elected leaders are denying the coronavirus is a big deal. #8221;) It is not going to go down well with voters, especially extra-vulnerable seniors in Florida and other sunshine states, if Trump leaves a trail of disease and death behind him. Likewise, Trump suffers from the perception he handled the killing of George Floyd and the demands for police reform poorly:  #8220;A 52% majority of voters in the battleground and 56% nationally say  #8216;Donald Trump #8217;s response to the killing of George Floyd and protests for criminal justice reform #8217; were mostly harmful. Just 23% of voters in the battleground and 21% nationally say Trump #8217;s response was helpful. #8221; Views on race seem also to have unleashed progressive impulses. ( #8220;A stunning 64% of voters nationally and 61% of voters in the competitive battleground agree that  #8216;We should invest more in education, mental health, and social services and spend less on policing. #8217; #8221;) Does anyone really think Trump is going to get on the bandwagon to champion real police reform or stop flaunting his unqualified support for police? It is unlikely, judging from the Republican Senate #8217;s aversion to another stimulus bill, that we will get an outpouring of support for  #8220;education, mental health, and social services #8221; from Trump and his congressional allies. The chances of him reinforcing his racist image, ignoring systemic racism and refusing to rein in police are much higher than the chances of reinventing himself as a model of inclusion and fairness. In short, Trump is in deep, deep trouble despite the advantages of incumbency, and despite a media spending spree. Unless he materially changes how he is handling the pandemic  #8212; not to mention the economy and race relations  #8212; there is not much reason to think he is going to improve his standing. In their wisdom, Democrats selected a well-liked nominee whose gaffes seem  #8220;baked in #8221; to voters #8217; evaluation of him. Meanwhile, former national security adviser John Bolton #8217;s book reminds us that Trump is a know-nothing (e.g., allegedly unclear if Russia owned Finland), is utterly corrupt (e.g., seeking to enlist the Chinese president #8217;s help to win) and lacks any appreciation for American values (e.g., allegedly giving the Chinese the thumbs-up to build concentration camps). They also remind us that the craven, simpering Senate Republicans who kept him in office need to go as well. The question, then, is not whether Democrats will get complacent. The real question is why Republicans are not in high panic and looking for a way either to dump Trump or distance themselves from him. Time is running out."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It #8217;s hard to tell if self-identified Republicans actually believe the things they tell pollsters or whether they reason backward from President Trump #8217;s views and decide they  #8212; surprise!  #8212; agree with him on most everything. Taken at face value, however, Republicans in the Trump era have become morally and politically alienated from their fellow Americans. The latest Quinnipiac poll illustrates the phenomenon: "Voters say 68  #8211; 27 percent that discrimination against black people in the United States is a serious problem.  #8230; 96 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents say discrimination against black people is a serious problem, while only 34 percent of Republicans say that. #8221; Really, only a third of Republicans see the ongoing murder of African Americans by police and the disproportionate hospitalizations and deaths among African Americas and think there is no serious problem? (Likewise, 83 percent of Republicans look at police across the country and decide, My, what a good job they are doing!) Self-identified Republicans seem to have adopted Trump #8217;s example of denial and lack of empathy. (It also underscores how white the Republican Party has become, with many still believing they are the true victims in America.) Two-thirds of Americans support the protests, but not Republicans. Among Republicans, 56 oppose the protests, while only 35 percent support them. (Why would they, if they think racism is not a problem and the police are doing a swell job?) Most Americans are amenable to leaving racist symbols and outdated thinking behind. Fifty-two percent support removing Confederate statues (although opinion is divided on renaming bases). A clear 57 percent support Black Lives Matter (a remarkable turnaround in just a few years). But 80 percent of Republicans oppose removing the statues and 61 percent have an unfavorable view of Black Lives Matter. Trump and his base are in an un-virtuous cycle. He acts like a racist and is attacked (rightly) for his words and conduct. His base rushes to support him, echoing his views. Trump doubles down to get the approval of his base. And on it goes. One aspect of the poll warrants emphasis: Women are far more empathetic toward African Americans and hence find themselves on the other side from Trump on hot-button issues surrounding racism. While 54 percent of men think the police around the country are doing a good job, only 44 percent of women do. Only 61 percent of men think racism is a big problem while 74 percent of women do. On taking down Confederate statues (56 percent of women vs. 47 percent of men), renaming military bases (52 percent vs. 42 percent) and support for Black Lives Matter (64 percent vs. 48 percent), men are consistently more sympathetic toward views Trump holds; women are consistently more hostile. What changes do you hope will come out of protests and debates about police and race? Write to The Post. Part of this reflects the continuing gender divide in politics (women are more liberal and more likely to be Democrats than men), but it also explains the gender divide. If you are more in tune with the underdog; resent bullying and the use of force against less powerful people; care about what people not like you are going through; and want a fairer society, Trump and today #8217;s GOP hold little for you. Perhaps the question we should explore is: What #8217;s wrong with American men?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "I have always wondered when the MAGA crowd and its Great Leader thought America was great. We know their appeal to disgruntled white voters is an exercise in phony nostalgia and wish fulfillment. Implicit in their slogan is a desire to go back to a time when whites  #8212; white men, to be specific  #8212; were numerically, politically, economically and culturally unchallenged. But when was this, exactly? 1950? 1920? We might have to go back to the 19th century. We got a hint this week when President Trump restated his support for U.S. Army bases to retain names of Confederate traitors and white supremacists. He said in one of his more bizarre interviews that removing the names would  #8220;divide #8221; Americans. (We aren #8217;t divided now, I suppose, because  #8220;America #8221; to him is his white base.) We wouldn #8217;t want to  #8220;bring people apart, #8221; he insisted  #8212; as the traitors did when they took up arms against fellow Americans? In the same interview, he said that no one really knew about Juneteenth (meaning, he and his lily-white staff were ignorant of it) until he brought it up. He also argued that his  #8220;when the looting starts, the shooting starts #8221; comment was appropriate. Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate blocked an effort to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol. I am getting the sense that Trump and his followers look back favorably on the Confederacy, the memory of which swells them with pride. (Does Trump know that, in addition to being racists and traitors, they were losers?) If you want some really antiquated thinking, travel back before germ theory caught on in the 19th century. Since then, it has held us in good stead as we have eliminated many deadly diseases. In the current crisis, every health expert tells us that mask-wearing and social isolation save lives since the disease spreads by aerosols (tiny droplets in the air). Blocking that means of transmission can drive the infection rate down. We can test who still has the virus, trace others a person testing positive has come into contact with and then isolate those people. Pretty basic, right? Nah, the science-denier in chief says testing is  #8220;overrated. #8221; (Don #8217;t people in the White House get tested regularly so they don #8217;t infect him?) Masks are for suckers, or, in Trump #8217;s mind, simply show you disapprove of him. The notion that people would follow medical advice and try to prevent becoming infected or infecting others seems foreign to him. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, observed in a podcast on Thursday that stay-at-home orders potentially saved millions of lives. Other studies have shown that if 80 percent of us wear masks, the rate of infection would plunge. Trump insists, with no evidence, that masks don #8217;t help:  #8220;They put their finger on the mask, and they take them off, and then they start touching their eyes and touching their nose and their mouth. And then they don #8217;t know how they caught it? #8221; (If you take the mask off properly, by the strings around your ears, as small children can manage to do, it #8217;s not an issue.)  #8220;One of the problems we face in the United States is that unfortunately, there is a combination of an anti-science bias that people are  #8212; for reasons that sometimes are, you know, inconceivable and not understandable  #8212; they just don #8217;t believe science and they don #8217;t believe authority, #8221; Fauci said. That would include the president, who leads the anti-science brigade, although Fauci didn #8217;t mention him specifically. Fauci continued, "It #8217;s amazing sometimes the denial there is. It #8217;s the same thing that gets people who are anti-vaxxers, who don #8217;t want people to get vaccinated, even though the data clearly indicate the safety of vaccines. #8221; Fauci added.  #8220;That #8217;s really a problem. #8221; Yes, it really is. Trump cares about none of that science stuff. He #8217;s ready to pack thousands into a closed arena in Tulsa. (Would Fauci attend such an event?  #8220;Personally, I would not. Of course not," he said.) It seems the leader of the MAGA crowd would be most at home when the Confederacy was still revered (by racists who promulgated the  #8220;Lost Cause #8221; nonsense), when scientists lacked the ability to contradict him and when only certain kinds of voters (his) could manage to cast their ballots. For the rest of us who live in a modern, multiracial, technologically sophisticated 21st-century America, he seems like a poor fit for president."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: The Associated Press reports: 'The Justice Department moved abruptly Friday night to oust Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan overseeing key prosecutions of President Donald Trump #8217;s allies and an investigation of his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. But Berman said he was refusing to leave his post and his ongoing investigations would continue.  #8220;I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position, #8221; Berman said. His statement came hours after Attorney General William Barr said Berman was stepping down from his position."' It is telling that we do not know which of many possible investigations may have triggered Barr #8217;s ire. There are so many to choose from. AP reports,  #8220;The move to oust Berman also comes days after allegations surfaced from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton that the president sought to interfere in an Southern District of New York investigation into the state-owned Turkish bank in an effort to cut deals with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo #287;an. #8221; There are also the original investigations into campaign finance violations for which Michael Cohen was prosecuted, the alleged insurance and tax irregularities that Cohen alluded to in testimony to Congress, and the investigations into Rudolph W. Giuliani #8217;s nefarious activities in Ukraine. You need a scorecard to keep track of Trump #8217;s legal vulnerabilities. Berman is an acting U.S. attorney appointed by the court and therefore likely cannot be fired by Barr until his successor is confirmed. His courageous refusal to depart may buy him time, or at the least force Trump personally to fire Berman, thereby making Trump directly responsible for what appears to be yet another attempt at obstruction of justice. AD Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tells me,  #8220;Under 28 U.S.C.  #167; 546(d), Berman continues to serve as the court-appointed U.S. Attorney for SDNY until the temporary vacancy he was appointed to fill is filled through Senate confirmation of a permanent successor. Even if the president could remove Berman personally, Barr can #8217;t. #8221; He points out that the U.S. attorney from New Jersey Craig Carpenito sent to temporarily fill Berman #8217;s spot has his own legal minefield. If Carpenito  #8220;tries to exercise power as the ostensible interim U.S. Attorney for SDNY as of July 3, as Barr says he will, he #8217;ll arguably be committing the federal crime of  #8216;falsely assum[ing] to be an [executive] officer #8217; 18 U.S.C. #167; 912, #8221; Tribe argues.  #8220;Whether any of these legal obstacles will prove decisive isn #8217;t clear, of course, but the Supreme Court #8217;s census decision last year, and its DACA decision a few days ago, should serve as reminders that, in America, the rule of law still matters. #8221; The latest turn of events is more embarrassment for self-deluded Republicans like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) who voted to acquit Trump during his impeachment trial and who thought Trump had learned his lesson. This is one of many efforts to fire investigators (including three inspectors general) looking into Trump administration wrongdoing. (Let #8217;s not forget Barr #8217;s attempt to un-prosecute Michael Flynn after the latter pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.) In this dizzying display of contempt for the Constitution and obstruction of legitimate investigations into the Trump administration, we see a level of lawlessness that puts Richard Nixon to shame. We should consider several aspects of the burgeoning constitutional crisis. First, how bad must the investigations be for Trump and company that Barr was willing to take the fight public, where his blatant lying (this time falsely asserting Berman resigned) would be exposed? Second, Barr #8217;s attempts in trying to belatedly clear Flynn and now to cut off investigation(s) are arguably efforts at obstruction of justice, which the next administration must investigate and, if warranted, prosecute. Third, any Justice Department official aiding Barr, arguing in court on his behalf or signing briefs in support of firing Berman, should think long and hard about his or her own professional responsibilities and the risk of being engaged in a possible conspiracy to obstruct justice. Every lawyer at DOJ, including every district U.S. attorney, has an obligation to refuse to carry out illegal orders. AD Senate Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) put out a statement Saturday morning that read, in part,  #8220;I am calling for the Department of Justice Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility to immediately launch an investigation into the reasons behind the decision by the president and the attorney general to attempt to dismiss Mr. Berman. #8221; The House will no doubt undertake the same; the administration will certainly stonewall. Almost lost in these gobsmacking events: We should not forget that newly revealed portions of the Mueller report suggest the special prosecutor #8217;s team considered Trump may have lied about lack of foreknowledge of the WikiLeaks release of Hillary Clinton emails. It is yet one more example of potential crimes for which Trump may be prosecuted once he leaves office. And the potential prosecutions for him and others sure are piling up. It is time for decent and honorable public servants at DOJ to quit and lay out the facts for the American people. Most importantly, nothing could better highlight the need to remove Trump at the polls in November and bring his lawlessness to an end."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Post reports: - As coronavirus cases surge in the U.S. South and West, health experts in countries with falling case numbers are watching with a growing sense of alarm and disbelief, with many wondering why virus-stricken U.S. states continue to reopen and why the advice of scientists is often ignored. -  #8220;It really does feel like the U.S. has given up, #8221; said Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious-diseases specialist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand  #8212; a country that has confirmed only three new cases over the past three weeks and where citizens have now largely returned to their pre-coronavirus routines. It is not so much that Americans have given up. Rather, it is that their president has made coronavirus-spreading conduct a test of political loyalty. President Trump gleefully assembled in Tulsa thousands of his followers (albeit far fewer than he hoped). They were apparently too deluded to know they were putting their lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk by cramming into an enclosed arena without masks, just so Trump could bask in the glory of a red-state crowd. (The Post reported,  #8220;Oklahoma reported 331 new coronavirus infections Saturday afternoon. The new cases put the state #8217;s rolling average at 281, setting the average high record for the eighth day in a row. Tulsa County reported 136 new cases  #8212; another high for both single-day and average cases, which now stand at 98, up from an average of 51 new cases a day one week ago. #8221; It evidently is of no concern to Trump.) The rally was not even in a state that he might lose in the fall; it is simply a conduit to undiluted MAGA fever, which may actually turn out to be quite deadly. When word comes out that six campaign staff have tested positive, Trump is irate  #8212; because word leaked out. The New York Times reported,  #8220;Mr. Trump, made aware of the sick campaign aides before departing for the rally, was incensed the news was made public, according to two people familiar with his reaction. #8221; If Trump does not care enough about the lives of thousands of rally-goers (or the tens of thousands they may infect) to defer a rally, or about the attendees of the Republican convention now planned for Jacksonville, Fla., to require masks or shift to a virtual mode, or about the senior citizens of Florida who may become infected when his RNC circus comes to their state, he surely is not going to care about the health of six campaign workers. The Republican Party, in its blind devotion to a man of such inhuman indifference to life (so much for the pro-life party), has succeeded in creating a culture war over unarguably effective health precautions. Protect yourself and your community or venerate Trump. Republicans choose the latter. A sea of white, unmasked faces showed up to flaunt their disdain for science and for human life. We already know the consequences of such conduct. (Trump weirdly boasted he had ordered testing to slow down, presumably to have fewer recorded cases. His team later claimed he was  #8220;kidding, #8221; his all-purpose excuse when he says dumb things.) In a slew of red states that reopened prematurely, where mask-rejecting Republicans remain intent on risking infection, incidents of coronavirus are soaring.  #8220;The United States reported more than 30,000 new infections on Friday, its highest total since May 1, with cases rising in 19 states across the South, West and Midwest, #8221; the New York Times reported.  #8220;Florida reported 4,049 new cases on Saturday, breaking Friday #8217;s record (3,822) and Thursday #8217;s record (3,207). The state now has had 93,797 cases and 3,144 deaths. South Carolina also broke its record for the third day in a row, with 1,155 new cases. #8221; This is not the conduct of a rational, normal leader, nor of a responsible party. Republicans are not only willing to commit political suicide in following Trump over the cliff in November; they also seem copacetic with the illness and death that their Trump idolatry spreads. Whether Trump #8217;s Tulsa rally leads to more sickness and death (as did Wisconsin #8217;s refusal to delay primary and local voting in April) is unknown. What is certain is that revering Trump requires extreme recklessness, if not contempt for the well-being of fellow Americans. For Trump, no lives matter other than his own."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump wanted to make China central to the 2020 campaign. Congratulations, Mr. President. You #8217;ll get your wish. Trump #8217;s begging Chinese dictator Xi Jinping to help him win reelection and his praise for Xi #8217;s detention of 1 million Muslim Uighurs in indoctrination and forced-labor camps are the most shocking revelations in former national security adviser John Bolton #8217;s new book. This information is important not just because it demonstrates that Trump #8217;s  #8220;tough on China #8221; rhetoric is hypocritical or confirms that Trump #8217;s only foreign policy concern is to get other countries to advance his personal interests. These revelations matter because they show that the very heart of Trump #8217;s appeal  #8212; to  #8220;Make America Great Again #8221; by putting  #8220;America First #8221;  #8212; is a lie all the way down. The paltry crowd he drew to his Saturday rally in Tulsa suggests that a spirit of doubt is taking hold even in his one-time strongholds. Trump never had any interest in the real sources of American greatness. He used an isolationist slogan from the late 1930s and early 1940s to suggest that our problems were with our democratic allies, not with tyrants. And he rejected what our greatest leaders always understood: that American influence in the world rests, finally, on whether our democracy provides an example that others would freely wish to emulate. Genuine American patriotism should never depend on false assertions of our perfection or a denial of our own sins. On the contrary, our desire to be what the prophet Isaiah called a  #8220;light unto the nations #8221; was always best invoked not as a boast but as a call to conscience. This year #8217;s Juneteenth celebrations of emancipation should encourage us to remember what Abraham Lincoln said in 1858 about  #8220;the monstrous injustice of slavery. #8221;  #8220;I hate it, #8221; Lincoln declared,  #8220;because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world, enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites, causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity. #8221; Defenders of slavery, Lincoln said, were  #8220;insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest. #8221; Notice what Lincoln was doing: He linked a moral stand against slavery with the best interests of the United States that lay firmly with  #8220;the real friends of freedom #8221; in the world. And he noted how our own failures would enable the enemies of freedom to taunt us. This is a remarkably precise description of what Trump #8217;s actions at home and abroad have wrought. Supporters of free institutions everywhere are aghast at what has become of us. The Xis and Putins of the world mock us, all the while knowing that the self-seeking simpleton in the White House will  #8220;make deals #8221; with them on his own behalf. They can point to the abrupt firing of Geoffrey Berman, the independent-minded U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to question whether our nation lives up to its claims of placing the rule of law above the whims and wishes of any chief executive. The dictators also know that Trump longs to exercise the same absolute powers they do because he says so outright. His comment on the Uighurs was entirely consistent with a worldview, if it can be called that, lacking any respect for what the words  #8220;democracy #8221; or  #8220;republicanism #8221; mean. Like all demagogues, he longs for the adulation of crowds and thus scheduled the Tulsa rally against the spirit of his own administration #8217;s medical guidance. He doesn #8217;t seem to care if his own loyalists get sick or die, though Saturday #8217;s no-shows apparently did. Just as telling is his attitude toward his fellow citizens who would exercise their liberty to dissent.  #8220;Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis, #8221; he tweeted Friday.  #8220;It will be a much different scene! #8221; The classic authoritarian move is to obliterate the distinction between protesting and looting, between peaceful assembly and anarchy. Everyone who stands against him becomes an  #8220;enemy of the state. #8221; Those opponents now encompass the entire range of foreign policy thinking  #8212; from dove to hawk, anti-interventionist to realist to neoconservative, free trade to fair trade. Defeating Trump will not settle their differences. But between now and November, what they share matters far more. At a minimum, they believe foreign policy should be about the interests of the country, not the needs of one man. They experience the same sense of horror when an American president praises a dictator for placing 1 million people into concentration camps. And however much those who stand against him might argue over whether the United States has lived up to its democratic ideals  #8212; whether at home or in alliances-of-convenience with dictatorships  #8212; they understand, like Lincoln, that our country will lose both its soul and its standing if it casts those ideals aside. So from here forward, remember that whenever Trump uses the word  #8220;China, #8221; he is talking about a regime he approached as a supplicant and whose repressive powers he envies."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "IT IS hard to fathom what Attorney General William P. Barr was thinking when he announced Friday that the country #8217;s most prominent prosecutor, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman, was  #8220;stepping down. #8221; Perhaps he thought that Mr. Berman would pretend that he had resigned simply because Mr. Barr released a statement indicating he had. Maybe he thought that announcing Mr. Berman #8217;s departure on a Friday night would minimize attention. Instead, Mr. Berman quickly denied any intention to step away, leading to speculation about Mr. Barr #8217;s motives  #8212; speculation fueled by President Trump #8217;s contempt for the rule of law and Mr. Barr #8217;s own sad record of politicizing the Justice Department. In a Friday statement, Mr. Berman himself raised the possibility that his ouster would interfere in his office #8217;s work. Mr. Berman has handled several high-profile investigations involving Trump associates, including the president #8217;s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and Mr. Trump #8217;s current personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Berman was not popular in the White House or the Trump Justice Department. Mr. Trump responded Saturday by firing Mr. Berman outright, with Mr. Barr claiming that the motive was simply to promote a  #8220;distinguished New York lawyer, Jay Clayton #8221; to be U.S. attorney, not to sideline Mr. Berman. This was a puzzling explanation, given that Mr. Barr did not need to fire Mr. Berman to make way for Mr. Clayton; Mr. Berman could have continued to serve until and unless the Senate confirms Mr. Clayton. Moreover, Mr. Clayton lacks federal prosecutorial experience. Given the circumstances of his appointment, Mr. Clayton also would lack the credibility to lead the Manhattan U.S. attorney #8217;s office. An attorney general interested in preserving the Justice Department #8217;s reputation for integrity would not so cavalierly sideline a U.S. attorney with a record of independence merely to make way for someone he liked better. At best the episode reveals stunning amateurishness. Mr. Barr acts astonished that anyone might suspect worse. He dismisses as  #8220;obviously false #8221; any suggestion that sidelining Mr. Berman might lead to inappropriate meddling in his office #8217;s investigations. In fact, it is not obvious. Not after Mr. Barr gutted the independence of the U.S. attorney #8217;s office in the District in order to roll back prosecutions of two of the president #8217;s lawbreaking friends. Not after he presided over the violent clearing of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square, then blamed it on the crowd. And not after he misled the public about the contents of the Mueller report and sicced handpicked inquisitors on those who conducted the Russia investigation. What well of credibility did he expect to draw on when he moved against Mr. Berman? How can prosecutors anywhere in the country have faith that Mr. Barr will safeguard the independence of the Justice Department?"</TEXT>

Barr told the New York Times Magazine that a foreign operation to mail in fake ballots was  #8220;one of the issues that I #8217;m real worried about. #8221;  #8220;We #8217;ve been talking about how, in terms of foreign influence, there are a number of foreign countries that could easily make counterfeit ballots, put names on them, send them in, #8221; Barr said.  #8220;And it #8217;d be very hard to sort out what #8217;s happening. #8221; Barr did not offer any evidence of how such a scenario would take place. Elections officials in multiple states said it would be virtually impossible for a foreign government to achieve what Barr described. AD Judd Choate, the elections chief in Colorado, where nearly all voters cast ballots by mail, said  #8220;there is zero chance #8221; it could happen in his state because of security precautions in place there. States use a variety of safeguards to confirm the validity of mail ballots. In about half the states, ballot envelopes bear a tracking bar code or tally mark that is unique to each voter. About 15 states require signatures to be matched against voter registration. Ballots are rejected if they are not sent in regulation envelopes that vary widely from state to state in format, size and paper stock. And there is little chance, administrators said, that election officials would not detect a surge of duplicate ballots arriving from the same voter.  #8220;There isn #8217;t an election office in this country that doesn #8217;t know how many ballots they #8217;ve mailed out, how many they #8217;ve gotten back in, and who they were sent to, #8221; said Tammy Patrick, a former election official with Maricopa County, Ariz., and now a senior adviser to the bipartisan foundation Democracy Fund.  #8220;It is absolutely not the case that someone could create a multitude of ballots and in some way infuse them or inject them into the system without detection. #8221; AD The Justice Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why Barr said he was concerned such a scheme could easily happen. The country is expected to see a surge of mail ballots this year after nearly 30 states have already changed rules or practices in response to the public health threat posed by the novel coronavirus. President Trump #8217;s campaign and the national GOP have launched a major effort to prevent the expansion of voting by mail, claiming it could lead to widespread fraud. Like Trump, the attorney general has himself voted absentee. State voting records show that Barr, a resident of Fairfax County, Va., in the suburbs of Washington, voted by mail in 2019 and 2012. Trump cast an absentee ballot in Florida #8217;s March primary. Barr #8217;s comments could serve to sow doubt about the integrity of the nation #8217;s election security, much as Trump has with a barrage of unfounded claims about widespread fraud, voting rights activists said. AD  #8220;The emphasis should be on protecting the right to vote and protecting electoral integrity, not creating boogeymen, #8221; said John Powers, a voting rights attorney with the Lawyers #8217; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. GOP pushes voting by mail  #8212; with restrictions  #8212; while Trump attacks it as  #8216;corrupt #8217; States that vote entirely by mail have developed extensive security measures to protect the vote. In Colorado, ballot envelopes feature tally marks that are unique to each voter, Choate said. Voter signatures are matched to those on file. Bad actors would have to replicate those marks, create ballots and envelopes made of the same paper and with the same design as authentic ones, and accurately forge signatures.  #8220;It #8217;s preposterous to the point of humor, #8221; Choate said. Even in states without all of those steps, those trying to counterfeit ballots would have to know the names and addresses of registered voters. And an onslaught of forged ballots duplicating ballots received from actual voters would almost certainly raise red flags in local election offices and prompt intensive investigations, officials said. AD  #8220;While it #8217;s difficult to comment on a hypothetical situation and we can only speak for North Carolina, it #8217;s almost inconceivable that a county board of elections wouldn #8217;t immediately detect  #8216;counterfeit ballots #8217; arriving at their offices, #8221; said Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections.  #8220;The county boards of elections send ballots out to those who request them. #8221; Chris Davis, the chief of elections in Williamson County, Tex., outside of Austin, said ballot envelopes are coded in his state, as well.  #8220;When I get these questions I usually say,  #8216;Anything #8217;s possible, but it #8217;s not easy to do, #8217; #8201; #8221; he said".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "In the early 20th century the American South was ravaged by pellagra, a nasty disease that produced the  #8220;four Ds #8221;  #8212; dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and death. At first, pellagra #8217;s nature was uncertain, but by 1915 Dr. Joseph Goldberger, a Hungarian immigrant employed by the federal government, had conclusively shown that it was caused by nutritional deficiencies associated with poverty, and especially with a corn-based diet. However, for decades many Southern citizens and politicians refused to accept this diagnosis, declaring either that the epidemic was a fiction created by Northerners to insult the South or that the nutritional theory was an attack on Southern culture. And deaths from pellagra continued to climb. Sound familiar? We #8217;ve known for months what it takes to bring Covid-19 under control. You need a period of severe lockdown to reduce the disease #8217;s prevalence. Only then can you reopen the economy  #8212; while maintaining social distancing as needed  #8212; and even then you need a regime of widespread testing, tracing and isolation of potentially infected individuals to keep the virus suppressed. Most advanced countries have gone down this route. A few countries, like New Zealand and South Korea, have largely or completely defeated the coronavirus. The European Union, comparable in population and diversity to the United States, continues to record new cases of Covid-19, but at a far slower rate than at the pandemic #8217;s peak in late March and early April. But the United States is exceptional, in a very bad way. Our rate of new cases never declined all that much, because falling infection rates in the New York area were offset by flat or rising infections in the South and the West. Now cases are on the rise nationally and surging in such states as Arizona, Texas and Florida. And no, reported infections aren #8217;t rising just because we #8217;re doing more testing; contra Donald Trump, we can #8217;t solve this problem just by testing less. Other indicators, like the percentage of tests coming back positive and hospitalization rates, show that the Covid-19 surge is real. It #8217;s true that deaths are still falling for the nation as a whole, although they #8217;re rising in some states. This reflects some combination of the way that deaths lag infections, better precautions for the elderly, who are the most vulnerable, and better treatment as doctors learn more about the disease. But we #8217;re still losing around 600 Americans per day  #8212; that is, we #8217;re experiencing the equivalent of six 9/11s every month. And many people who aren #8217;t killed by Covid-19 are nonetheless debilitated by the illness, sometimes permanently. Why are we doing so badly? A lot of the answer is that many state governments have rushed to return to business as usual even though only a handful of states meet federal criteria for even the initial phase of reopening. Epidemiologists warned that premature reopening would lead to a new wave of infections  #8212; and they were right. Beyond that, in America, and only in America, basic health precautions have been caught up in a culture war. Most obviously, not wearing a face mask, and hence gratuitously endangering other people, has become a political symbol: Trump has suggested that some people wear masks only to signal disapproval of him, and many Americans have decided that requiring masks in indoor spaces is an assault on their freedom. Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. As a result, social distancing has become partisan: self-identified Republicans do less of it than self-identified Democrats. We all saw how this plays out in Tulsa, where a large (if smaller than expected) crowd gathered, mostly without masks, in an indoor setting custom-designed to spread the coronavirus. And the next Trump rally, on Tuesday, will take place in Arizona, where Covid-19 is exploding, but where the Republican governor not only refuses to require mask-wearing but refused until a few days ago to allow local governments to impose their own rules. The moral of this story is that America #8217;s uniquely poor response to the coronavirus isn #8217;t just the result of bad leadership at the top  #8212; although tens of thousands of lives would have been saved if we had a president who would deal with problems instead of trying to wish them away. We #8217;re also doing badly because, as the example of pellagra shows, there #8217;s a longstanding anti-science, anti-expertise streak in American culture  #8212; the same streak that makes us uniquely unwilling to accept the reality of evolution or acknowledge the threat of climate change. We aren #8217;t a nation of know-nothings; many, probably most Americans are willing to listen to experts and act responsibly. But there #8217;s a belligerent faction within our society that refuses to acknowledge inconvenient or uncomfortable facts, preferring to believe that experts are somehow conspiring against them. Trump hasn #8217;t just failed to rise to the policy challenge posed by Covid-19. He has, with his words and actions  #8212; notably his refusal to wear a mask  #8212; encouraged and empowered America #8217;s anti-rational streak. And this rejection of expertise, science and responsibility in general is killing us."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Former President Barack Obama and his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., on Tuesday held their first joint event of the 2020 campaign, where Mr. Obama warned Democrats against becoming complacent about the presidential election and offered an unusually direct and detailed rebuke of President Trump. The split-screen appearance of the presumptive Democratic nominee and his former boss came as Mr. Biden has enjoyed a run of strong fund-raising, while a spate of recent polls have shown him holding as much as a double-digit lead over Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden #8217;s campaign announced Tuesday that the event had raised $7.6 million from 175,000 grass-roots contributors. But Mr. Obama instructed the 120,000 people who logged on to watch that they must not take the election for granted.  #8220;We can #8217;t be complacent or smug or sense that somehow it #8217;s so obvious that this president hasn #8217;t done a good job, because look, he won once, #8221; Mr. Obama said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story  #8220;This is serious business, #8221; he added.  #8220;Whatever you #8217;ve done so far is not enough. And I hold myself and Michelle and our kids to that same standard. #8221; Throughout their joint appearance, which ran a little over an hour, Mr. Obama  #8212; who speaks infrequently about Mr. Trump  #8212; praised Mr. Biden #8217;s character and experience, and cast the president as a grave threat to the character and values of the nation. He said that Mr. Trump exploited and amplified divisions, and expressed concerns about the example he was setting on the world stage, citing his  #8220;militarized response to peaceful demonstrators #8221; and saying he  #8220;basically threatens and consistently impugns the free press. #8221; Such an approach, he suggested, emboldened dictators around the world who may doubt they will be held to account by the United States. Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said in response that the president  #8220;makes every decision based on what #8217;s best for the people of the United States, rather than what will make him popular at the United Nations. #8221; Advertisement Continue reading the main story As Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden assembled onscreen, campaigning virtually amid the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Trump was on the trail in Arizona, a few days after holding a rally in Tulsa, Okla., that drew widespread condemnation from public health officials.  #8220;Unlike our current president, we recognize that we have a public health crisis going on, #8221; Mr. Obama said, acknowledging that campaign volunteering may look different during the coronavirus outbreak. Chuckling incredulously, he invoked the nation #8217;s top infectious disease expert.  #8220;Poor Dr. Fauci, who #8217;s having to, you know, testify and then see his advice flouted by the person he #8217;s working for, #8221; Mr. Obama said. In April, after Mr. Biden had effectively wrapped up the Democratic nomination, Mr. Obama released a video endorsing his former running mate, urging party unity around Mr. Biden #8217;s candidacy and making overtures in particular to the younger, liberal supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. On Tuesday, he spoke directly to younger Americans who are pressing for structural changes to address matters from racism to economic inequality to global warming. There is a  #8220;great awakening #8221; among young people in particular, he said, who are  #8220;fed up with the shambolic, disorganized, mean-spirited approach #8221; to governance in recent years, and want to tackle  #8220;some of the core challenges that have been facing this country for centuries. #8221; But he also stressed the need to connect that ambition to electoral participation. Throughout the primary, Mr. Biden struggled to excite young Democratic voters, but he will need to find ways to turn many of them out in the general election. Advertisement Continue reading the main story  #8220;Just because this energy is out there, it does not mean that it assures our victory, #8221; he said.  #8220;And it does not mean that it gets channeled in a way that results in real change. #8221; Mr. Obama also headlined a smaller virtual gathering Tuesday for big donors that raised another $3.4 million. Throughout the grass-roots event, Mr. Biden frequently expressed agreement with his former boss, whom he called  #8220;Mr. President, #8221; as they discussed issues including health care access and foreign policy. They bantered some about Mr. Biden #8217;s age  #8212; 77  #8212; and the former vice president invoked the baseball player Satchel Paige. In Mr. Biden #8217;s telling, Mr. Paige #8217;s philosophy toward age was,  #8220; #8216;How old would you be if you didn #8217;t know how old you were? #8217; I agree with Satchel Paige, I #8217;m 50, #8221; Mr. Biden said. He also spoke passionately about the need to fight racism and spoke expansively about the evolution of civil rights in America. In the 1960s, he said, white Americans saw shocking images of the police like Alabama #8217;s Bull Connor attacking black Americans with fire hoses,  #8220;and they #8217;re going,  #8216;Oh my God. It really is happening. #8217; They saw it in black and white, no pun intended, because that #8217;s what most TVs were at the time. #8221; In contrast to the 1960s, he said, when it comes to civil rights and civic engagement,  #8220;this time around there is a much broader participation. #8221; That level of engagement gave both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden hope, they said.  #8220;Love you Joe, #8221; Mr. Obama signed off.  #8220;Love you too, pal, #8221; Mr. Biden said."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "A massive transfer of wealth is underway and will accelerate in the coming years. Baby boomers and the generation that preceded them currently own $84 trillion, or 81 percent of all U.S. household wealth  #8212; wealth that will before long be inherited by their children and other beneficiaries. This extraordinary transfer of resources will further cement the economic inequality that plagues the United States because this wealth is tightly concentrated in the hands of a few. And it will be passed on as taxes on such transfers are at historic lows. Among high-income countries, the United States has one of the lowest levels of intergenerational economic mobility, meaning a child #8217;s economic future is heavily influenced by his or her parents #8217; income. We have the second-highest level of income inequality after taxes and government transfers, and the highest level of wealth inequality. These disparities are sharply skewed by race. Median black household wealth is only 9 percent that of white households, a racial wealth gap that is even larger than in 1968. New research suggests the pandemic will further increase wealth inequality, as the affluent save more and the poor earn less. Effectively addressing these systemic inequalities will require many things. But increasing the taxation of inheritances is one vital component. This year, Americans will inherit about $765 billion. People who were already rich will inherit a lot more than people who weren #8217;t wealthy. So will white households; they are twice as likely as black households to receive an inheritance, and receiving an inheritance is associated with an increase in wealth that is 26 times larger for white families than for black families. (This accounting of inheritances includes gifts and bequests, other than those to spouses or to support minor children.) Roughly 40 percent of all household wealth stems from inheritances. This means that 40 percent of why some Americans are extraordinarily well off has nothing to do with smarts, hard work, frugality, lucky gambles or entrepreneurial ingenuity. It is simply because they were born to rich parents. Inheritances compound over generations, one reason societies often choose to tax them as a way to combat rising inequality and level the playing field. Our tax system has always been one of our most potent tools for expressing and acting upon our values. But in this area, it is failing and only getting worse. Consider a wealthy couple who bequeaths $50 million to their son. The couple will probably not have paid income or payroll tax on a large share of the bequest, thanks to a provision called stepped-up basis, which exempts gains on bequeathed assets from tax. Their son can exclude the entire $50 million he receives from his income and payroll tax returns. The estate tax was meant to partially correct for these omissions. Indeed, it is the only tax that will apply to the son #8217;s inheritance. But over time Congress has hollowed out the estate tax and its cousins, most recently in the 2017 tax law. Today, the first $23 million that a couple transfers is entirely exempt from the estate tax. Amounts above that threshold are taxed only at a 40 percent rate. As a result, the effective tax rate on this lucky heir #8217;s $50 million inheritance will only be 21 percent. And that #8217;s if his parents didn #8217;t use any estate-tax planning techniques to reduce his tax burden. If they did, his tax rate could easily approach zero. Some will argue that this example ignores any income and payroll tax the wealthy parents paid when they originally earned the $50 million. But if the couple paid their personal chef #8217;s wages out of after-tax income, we wouldn #8217;t think their personal chef should get credit for the taxes they paid. Similarly, we should ignore any income or payroll tax the couple paid when considering how much their son should contribute to the costs of government. Combining the effects of estate, income and payroll taxes, the average federal tax rate on income in the form of inheritances is a minuscule one-seventh of the average tax rate on income from saving and good old-fashioned hard work. A fairer tax system would tax inheritances at higher rates than income from working, not lower. Someone who inherits millions is better off than someone who had to work for their millions because, let #8217;s face it, most of us would rather not work. Moreover, wealthy heirs are better off because typically they can earn much higher salaries if they do work, benefiting from the education, connections and safety net available to those from well-off families. A large body of research also finds that wealth transfer taxes do relatively little to reduce the amount of work, saving and entrepreneurship by donors. Meanwhile, such taxes increase work by heirs and charitable giving. This research suggests that the optimal tax rate on very large inheritances is between 60 percent and 80 percent. Americans agree that inheritances should be taxed relatively heavily. According to one study, they support taxing wealth from inheritances at almost four times the tax rate on wealth from savings. There are plenty of sensible options for increasing taxes on inheritances. Returning the estate tax to its 2009 levels would raise $270 billion over the next decade. Further increasing the rate so that it rises to 65 percent on estates over $1 billion would raise an additional $100 billion. An even better approach would be to replace the estate tax with an inheritance tax. Under an inheritance tax, heirs would simply pay income and payroll taxes on their inheritance above a large exemption, just as others do on their wages." [CUT FOR LENGTH]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, the concentration of wealth at the top is hurting the country. There is so much less disposable income for the average Joe than there was before Reagan started cutting taxes on the rich. Add in all the ridiculous loopholes the wealthy (thanks to their power) have been able to pass over the years, and they are simply not paying their share. They now pay *less* than any group, at 23%. They're sucking all the money out of the economy and not returning it. Higher taxes on the rich would pay for a much stronger social safety net, such as universal or single-payer health care. (Health care costs are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the US.) More money in the pockets of lower and middle class people would improve America as a country. We might even devalue greed as a virtue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Coronavirus infections have surged in a number of states, setting the United States on a markedly different pandemic trajectory than other wealthy nations. There are many reasons our response to the pandemic tied to nearly 120,000 U.S. deaths has faltered, experts say, including the lack of a cohesive federal policy, missteps on testing and tracing, and a national culture emphasizing individualism. In recent weeks, three studies have focused on conservative media #8217;s role in fostering confusion about the seriousness of the coronavirus. Taken together, they paint a picture of a media ecosystem that amplifies misinformation, entertains conspiracy theories and discourages audiences from taking concrete steps to protect themselves and others. How two doctors became central to the push to lift coronavirus stay-at-home orders Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi became rising stars among conservatives circles after holding a now-viral press conference on April 22. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) The end result, according to one of the studies, is that infection and mortality rates are higher in places where one pundit who initially downplayed the severity of the pandemic  #8212; Fox News #8217; Sean Hannity  #8212; reaches the largest audiences.  #8220;We are receiving an incredible number of studies and solid data showing that consuming far-right media and social media content was strongly associated with low concern about the virus at the onset of the pandemic, #8221; said Irene Pasquetto, chief editor of the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review, which published one of the studies. Misinformation and conspiracy theories In April, Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and Dolores Albarracin of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign published a peer-reviewed study examining how Americans #8217; media diets affected their beliefs about the coronavirus. Administering a nationally representative phone survey with 1,008 respondents, they found that people who got most of their information from mainstream print and broadcast outlets tended to have an accurate assessment of the severity of the pandemic and their risks of infection. But those who relied on conservative sources, such as Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, were more likely to believe in conspiracy theories or unfounded rumors, such as the belief that taking vitamin C could prevent infection, that the Chinese government had created the virus, and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was exaggerating the pandemic #8217;s threat  #8220;to damage the Trump presidency. #8221; These findings held even after controlling for viewers #8217; political affiliation, education, gender and age. The authors pinpoint several examples of misinformation circulating in conservative media. For example, on March 6 Fox medical contributor Marc Siegel stated, on Hannity #8217;s popular evening program, that  #8220;the virus should be compared to the flu. Because at worst, at worst, worst-case scenario it could be the flu. #8221; Similarly, in February Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton (R) appeared on Fox #8217;s  #8220;Sunday Morning Futures #8221; to suggest, without evidence, that the virus was connected to a research laboratory in Wuhan, China."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Joe Biden gave a speech on Thursday in which he tore into President Trump over the legal brief his lawyers are expected to file in support of a lawsuit that would destroy the Affordable Care Act. Biden is getting attention for ripping Trump #8217;s  #8220;whining and self pity #8221; about criticism he #8217;s endured the pandemic. That #8217;s lively stuff. But the more significant moment might have been when the presumptive Democratic nominee offered what may be the longest soliloquy yet in this campaign to the emotional hardships countless Americans are enduring due to the constraints of social distancing. Biden said bluntly that we face a long struggle with coronavirus, and that we #8217;ll have to  #8220;do both the simple things and the hard things to keep our families and everybody safe, to reopen our economy #8221; and  #8220;put the pandemic behind us. #8221; He then said this about mask-wearing and social distancing: 'I know as Americans, it #8217;s not something we #8217;re used to. But it matters. All the evidence from all over the world tells us it just might be the single most effective thing we can do. We #8217;re going to have to socially distance, like we are here today. 'It #8217;s not easy. It seems so strange to us. Not as Americans, but as human beings. We #8217;re built to talk, to laugh, to hug, to gather with other people. I know I am, and I know you are. But for now, we #8217;re going to have to socially distance. It matters. 'We #8217;re going to have to find a way to keep our economy running as we bring the number of cases down. The president wants us to believe there #8217;s a choice between the economy and public health. Amazingly, he still hasn #8217;t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis: To fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus.' Last month, when many lamented that Biden was stuck broadcasting from his basement, we suggested it might actually play well for him, because it showed Biden enduring in solidarity what so many other Americans were coping with at the time, while Trump resumed travel without masks or social distancing. The Biden camp, we reported, was operating from the premise that Biden could show voters how a president should conduct himself amid such a trying crisis, by setting an example for conduct  #8212; at the time, remaining on lockdown  #8212; that, while emotionally grueling, would ultimately benefit us all. This latest discussion of the hardships of social distancing seems like a continuation of that basic bet. Indeed, after Biden finished his speech, he put on his mask before heading offstage  #8212; a moment that seemed all about drawing this deeper contrast. A Biden adviser told me he #8217;s trying to strike a balance, emphasizing  #8220;the most effective ways to keep families safe and healthy #8221; while also letting people know  #8220;on a human level #8221; that  #8220;he personally understands how difficult some of those behaviors and strategies can be. #8221; Now contrast that with the bet that Trump has made  #8212; openly and proudly. Trump almost never wears a mask at public appearances  #8212; which is facilitated by special access to testing that he and his top advisers enjoy. He held a massive rally in Tulsa, even as his campaign had attendees sign a waiver in case they got sick. When Trump discovered to his horror that the rally was sparsely attended, it demonstrated that his magical reality-warping powers couldn #8217;t persuade even his own supporters that coronavirus doesn #8217;t pose a threat when people are in close proximity without masks and social distancing. This week #8217;s New York Times/Siena College poll found that 54 percent of American voters say they always wear a mask when they expect to be close to others, while another 22 percent say they usually do, and only 22 percent say they rarely or never do. Those numbers are likely an overstatement; surely many people tell pollsters they wear masks while leaving the mask at home here and there. But, plainly, majorities recognize that these precautions are the right thing to do, and don #8217;t subscribe to the ideology  #8212; neo-Social Darwinism, dumbed-down dorm-room libertarianism, stylized pseudo-intellectual anti-science conservatism, whatever you call it  #8212; driving the supposed rebellion against mask-wearing, which continues to be a fringe position. Standing vocally for wearing masks sends an important signal, too. As Zeynep Tufekci noted, masks indicate  #8220;solidarity #8221; amid a time that is not  #8220;business as usual, #8221; a recognition that crisis moments like this one  #8220;require us to change our behavior, #8221; but  #8220;collectively, #8221; which means that  #8220;knowing our fellow citizens are on board is important. #8221; It #8217;s important because this is hard. And that #8217;s why it #8217;s also important for our leaders to be on board with it, while recognizing and speaking to the hardships it imposes."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "In the hours before his rally in Tulsa, President Trump #8217;s campaign directed the removal of thousands of  #8220;Do Not Sit Here, Please! #8221; stickers from seats in the arena that were intended to establish social distance between rallygoers, according to video and photos obtained by The Washington Post and a person familiar with the event. The removal contradicted instructions from the management of the BOK Center, the 19,000-seat arena in downtown Tulsa where Trump held his rally on June 20. At the time, coronavirus cases were rising sharply in Tulsa County, and Trump faced intense criticism for convening a large crowd for an indoor political rally, his first such event since the start of the pandemic. As part of its safety plan, arena management had purchased 12,000 do-not-sit stickers for Trump #8217;s rally, intended to keep people apart by leaving open seats between attendees. On the day of the rally, event staff had already affixed them on nearly every other seat in the arena when Trump #8217;s campaign told event management to stop and then began removing the stickers, hours before the president #8217;s arrival, according to a person familiar with the event who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. In a video clip obtained by The Washington Post, two men  #8212; one in a suit and one wearing a badge and a face mask  #8212; can be seen pulling stickers off seats in a section of the arena. It is unclear who those two men are. When Trump took the stage on Saturday evening, the crowd was clustered together and attendees were not leaving empty seats between themselves. The actions by Trump #8217;s campaign were first reported Friday by Billboard Magazine. As rally preparations were underway, Trump #8217;s campaign staff intervened with the venue manager, ASM Global, and told them to stop labeling seats in this way, Doug Thornton, executive vice president of ASM Global, told the magazine.  #8220;They also told us that they didn #8217;t want any signs posted saying we should social distance in the venue, #8221; Thornton said.  #8220;The campaign went through and removed the stickers. #8221; Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh did not directly respond to questions about the sticker removal.  #8220;The rally was in full compliance with local requirements. In addition, every rally attendee received a temperature check prior to admission, was given a face mask, and provided ample access to hand sanitizer, #8221; Murtaugh said in an emailed statement. In a separate statement, the campaign said:  #8220;There were signs posted and we are not aware of any campaign staff asking that they be removed. #8221; Trump held his Tulsa rally despite opposition by Oklahoma health authorities and residents who feared that convening a large crowd indoors could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus. The number of coronavirus cases in Tulsa County was spiking in the days leading up to the rally and has continued to increase since. The director of the Tulsa Health Department, Bruce Dart, had recommended that the event be postponed until it was safer. A number of city residents and business owners brought a lawsuit against the venue manager, ASM Global, seeking to require all attendees wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines from health authorities. The Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected that suit. On June 13, a week before the rally, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) wrote to the venue management saying he understood that Trump #8217;s campaign  #8220;has presented plans to ASM Global in order to accommodate capacity crowds during a political rally. #8221; Stitt noted that Oklahoma was in  #8220;Phase 3 #8221; of its reopening plan and Trump #8217;s rally  #8220;proceeding as planned is consistent with the guidance #8221; of that plan. Stitt #8217;s letter added that  #8220;we have also encouraged event licensees to refer to the general CDC guidelines for more information about COVID-19. #8221; Two days before the rally, the managers of the BOK Center had asked the Trump campaign to provide a detailed written plan outlining the  #8220;health and safety #8221; measures it intended to use to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Before the rally, Murtaugh said in an emailed statement:  #8220;We take safety seriously, which is why we're doing temperature checks for everyone attending, and providing masks and hand sanitizer. This will be a Trump rally, which means a big, boisterous, excited crowd. We don #8217;t recall the media shaming demonstrators about social distancing  #8212; in fact the media were cheering them on. #8221; As the crowd entered the day of the rally, the Trump campaign handed out masks and small bottles of  #8220;Make America Great Again 2020 #8221; branded hand sanitizer. The BOK Center also put down floor decals in front of concession areas and put up plexiglass to protect vendors. At 1:47 p.m. that day, Fox 23 News posted on its Facebook page a photo from inside the BOK Center showing two members of the event staff putting stickers on seats.  #8220;Stickers are going on every other seat in the BOK Center saying  #8216;Do Not Sit Here #8217; to try to spread the crowd out for President Trump #8217;s rally tonight, #8221; the post read. After the majority of the stickers were in place, a member of Trump #8217;s campaign radioed staff in the event war room where arena management was monitoring preparations and told them to stop, according to the person familiar with the event. Event staff was told to continue applying the stickers. Later, the campaign began pulling them off, the person said. In video footage of Trump #8217;s rally, there appeared to be no effort to keep an empty seat between attendees. Attendance turned out to be less than Trump expected  #8212; he had said some 1 million people wanted tickets  #8212; and the arena was not full, particularly in the upper level. Since the rally, coronavirus cases in Tulsa County hit a new high of 259 new confirmed cases on June 23."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump and his campaign team are grappling with how to resuscitate his imperiled reelection effort amid a wave of polling that shows him badly trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and losing traction even among core constituencies. Some Trump advisers and allies are privately pushing for sweeping changes to the campaign, including the idea of a major staff shake-up and trying to convince the president to be more disciplined in his message and behavior. But so far, the campaign has settled only on incremental changes  #8212; such as hiring and elevating a handful of operatives who worked on Trump #8217;s upset victory in 2016  #8212; and has yet to settle on a clear message for his reelection. Campaign officials and other advisers are also still struggling with how to best focus their attacks on Biden, which so far have been scattershot and have failed to curb his rise among voters. And then there #8217;s Trump himself, who has derailed his team #8217;s desired themes on an almost daily basis  #8212; deploying racist rhetoric and mounting incendiary attacks on critics amid a surging coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis and roiling protests over police brutality. Numerous national polls show Trump losing significant ground with seniors and among white voters, including both those with and without four-year college degrees. He has also slipped among white evangelical voters. According to new New York Times/Siena College polls, Trump is at least slightly behind Biden in six states that he won in 2016 and are pivotal to his reelection path  #8212; including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where he trails by double digits.  #8220;You can #8217;t win with these numbers. They #8217;re atrocious numbers, #8221; said Edward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC Great America and the former campaign manager for Ronald Reagan #8217;s 1984 reelection campaign.  #8220;The president must straighten his campaign out and convey to the American people that he can move forward and lead, #8221; Rollins said.  #8220;He #8217;s got to go out and add 10 points pretty quick. If he can do that, he #8217;ll win. If not, Biden is sitting there as the alternative. #8221; Trump #8217;s advisers and allies have grown frustrated with some of the president #8217;s incendiary and divisive behavior and comments in recent weeks and are dismayed by the polls, including some of their own internal surveys that also show him losing to Biden. The president also came under fire for a June 20 rally in Tulsa that failed to attract much of a crowd even as the campaign downplayed coronavirus distancing guidelines. But many Trump allies remain deeply skeptical of the public polling  #8212; pointing to 2016 polls in key states that underestimated Trump #8217;s support  #8212; and say the internal polling and modeling that they #8217;re sharing with the president is less grim than the public surveys. Multiple campaign and Republican officials also asserted that they have seen no serious erosion in Trump #8217;s political base.  #8220;Over the past four months, the president #8217;s support among Republican voters has ranged between 90 and 94 percent consistently, #8221; said Tony Fabrizio, the campaign #8217;s chief pollster, referring to the campaign #8217;s internal polls.  #8220;As of our most recently polling, it stands at 94 percent. #8221; Fabrizio added that any erosion is among independent voters, who always swing back and forth between the two candidates. Trump has polled advisers on whether he should make changes to the campaign, and several White House and campaign officials said there were ongoing discussions on how to improve the president #8217;s political standing. The president has responded to the turmoil by doubling down on his nativist and base instincts, attempting to rally his core supporters through controversial and racially tinged comments and tweets. The latest example came Sunday, when Trump retweeted a video that included a supporter proclaiming  #8220;white power #8221; in response to counterprotesters and calling his backers in Florida retirement community where the demonstration occurred  #8220;great people. #8221; Trump later deleted the tweet and a White House spokesman said the president had not heard the  #8220;white power #8221; shout. He has twice referred to the deadly coronavirus, which originated in China, derisively as the  #8220;kung flu. #8221; In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Monday, he baselessly accused former president Barack Obama of  #8220;treason. #8221; And he has dismissed the racial justice protesters  #8212; who took to the streets after the killing of George Floyd in police custody  #8212; as  #8220;hoodlums, #8221;  #8220;thugs, #8221; and even  #8220;terrorists, #8221; promising  #8220;retribution #8221; in an interview with Fox News #8217;s Sean Hannity on Thursday night. Advisers, meanwhile, are frustrated with the president #8217;s tendency to portray himself as the victim, and have urged him to stop the public displays of self-pity.  #8220;If the election was today, we are in big trouble, #8221; according to one person close to Trump, who like others requested anonymity to share a candid assessment.  #8220;Thankfully it is not. #8221; Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) warned on ABC News #8217;s  #8220;This Week #8221; on Sunday that if Trump  #8220;doesn #8217;t change course both in terms of the substance of what he #8217;s discussing and the way that he approaches the American people, then he will lose. #8221; The trend is obvious, #8221; Christie said.  #8220;The trend is moving towards Joe Biden when Joe Biden hasn #8217;t said a word. Joe Biden #8217;s hiding in the basement and not saying anything. No discredit to the vice president  #8212; if you #8217;re winning without doing anything, why do anything. #8221; An urgent task for Trump and his team, advisers say, is to find a way to negatively define Biden  #8212; transforming the election into a choice between the two men, rather than a referendum on Trump. Trump has recently been asking advisers if he should stick with his current nickname for Biden  #8212;  #8220;Sleepy Joe #8221;  #8212; or try to coin another moniker, such as  #8220;Swampy Joe #8221; or  #8220;Creepy Joe. #8221; The president is not convinced that  #8220;Sleepy Joe #8221; is particularly damaging, and some of his advisers agree and have urged him to stop using the nickname. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump tried out yet another variant:  #8220;Corrupt Joe. #8221;"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "When Barack Obama won his sweeping victory in 2008 and carried Democrats to enlarged majorities in the House and Senate, progressive voices rang out in celebration of a new political majority empowered by a new generation. Obama #8217;s triumph was seen not just as an individual success, but also as a realigning event. The Obama Coalition, its champions insisted, would set the tone for the coming decades, much as the New Deal Coalition had defined the parameters of American politics from 1932 to 1968. It didn #8217;t quite work out that way. Republicans came roaring back to take control of the House in 2010. Far from adjusting themselves to a liberalism thought to be on the rise, the GOP moved even further right as the tea party became the new political vogue. Obama did win reelection, but Republicans continued their forward march in Congress, taking the Senate in 2014. Two years later, Donald Trump eked out his electoral college victory and shook the country to its foundations. You might fairly conclude that political analysts predicting realignments are not much different from stock market touts whose absolute  #8212; and mistaken  #8212; certainties about coming bull or bear markets lose a lot of people a lot of money. Since the rise of Ronald Reagan in 1980, many more realignments have been forecast than actually materialized. But there is another way to look at those 2008 predictions: They were not wrong, they were just premature. As a result, a 77-year-old Democratic presidential nominee may be the unlikely instrument of a new generational alignment. Why now and not in 2008? The most important reason is the obvious one: The backlash against Trump is the driving factor in this election so far  #8212; and there could be no better representative of the politics of the past than the current occupant in the White House. He is stubbornly out of touch with the country #8217;s attitudes on many questions, and especially so on racial justice. Far from adjusting to different times, Trump is betting  #8212; as he did in 2016 and as the tea party did in the Obama years  #8212; that the leftover right-wing slogans from the 1960s (see:  #8220;LAW AND ORDER! #8221;) and a defense of Confederate  #8220;heritage #8221; will win him the overwhelming majorities among older white voters that he needs to carry battleground states. But this isn #8217;t working, and not only because former vice president Joe Biden is an older white guy who is rather hard to tar as an agent of the revolutionary left. It #8217;s also failing because many older voters are petrified of what Trump #8217;s astonishingly inept handling of the coronavirus pandemic means for their health and their very lives. But more importantly for the long run, the 2020 electorate is not the electorate of the tea party wave, or even of 2016. The new generations that Obama realignment enthusiasts acclaimed 12 years ago are, at long last, the dominant groups in the electorate. As a Pew Research Center study showed, members of Gen Z (born after 1996) couldn #8217;t even vote in 2012 and made up just 4 percent of the 2016 potential electorate. But they will account for 1 in 10 eligible voters this year. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) will constitute 27 percent of this year #8217;s eligible voters. In combination with Gen Xers (born 1965 to 1980), more than 6 in 10 of this year #8217;s electorate will be younger than 55. Three things are true: (1.) The post-boomer generations are more diverse than the rest of the electorate. (2.) Younger whites are more liberal than their elders on matters of racial justice  #8212; as a Washington Post-Schar School poll showed this month  #8212; and on social issues. (3.) The share of millennials who vote will be higher than in Obama #8217;s elections simply because they are older than they were in 2008 or 2012. The 14-point lead Biden enjoyed over Trump in the New York Times/Siena College poll released last week reflects all these factors. Biden is splitting voters over 50 roughly evenly with Trump and then overwhelming the president among registered voters under 35 (59 to 25 percent) and those 35 to 49 (53 to 30 percent). Nor did Biden #8217;s margins depend solely on the diversity of the younger cohorts. Among whites under 45, Biden led Trump 52 to 30 percent. Thus could a president who rose to power by exploiting the fears and anxieties of the aging part of the country find himself brought down by the rising generations who have had enough of the past. The United States of Trump #8217;s imagination may simply no longer exist."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Supreme Court in a 5-to-4 decision struck down a Louisiana law  #8212; one nearly identical to a Texas law previously found unconstitutional  #8212; that would have essentially eliminated access to abortion by requiring doctors in the state to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, a measure repeatedly found to have virtually nothing to do with any legitimate health concern. Joining the court #8217;s four liberals, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. preserved the architecture of abortion precedent that pro-lifers sought to abolish with the elevation of Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh to the bench. For those who supported Donald Trump despite his personal corruption and unfitness because he would eradicate abortion rights, the decision comes as a blow; for Trump, it marks the third defeat in the past two weeks (following a decision barring discrimination against LGBTQ employees and another preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program) and yet another blow to right-wingers #8217; rationale for supporting him. Ilyse Hogue, head of NARAL Pro-Choice America, tells me:  #8220;Today #8217;s decision is a victory for women and a victory for the rule of law, two vital components of a functioning democracy. The radicals that put Kavanaugh on the bench are disappointed but not defeated. #8221; She warns,  #8220;They #8217;ll try again. We have to stay vigilant and flip the Senate to be sure we have no more close calls. #8221; The decision is also bad news for Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who disingenuously claimed both Kavanaugh and Gorsuch would uphold Roe v. Wade. If not for Roberts, her votes on confirmation would have been disastrous for pro-choice voters who have supported her through the years. Her chances of reelection, already slim, have become even worse. The decision itself is a tribute to precedent, and the concurrence is a testament to Roberts #8217;s mission to preserve the integrity of the court  #8212; that is, to prevent it from becoming a handmaiden to the right. In an opinion by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the court made an initial but critical procedural ruling maintaining the standing of abortion clinics to challenge abortion legislation on behalf of their patients. Turning to the merits, Breyer wrote: We apply the constitutional standards set forth in our earlier abortion-related cases, and in particular in Casey and Whole Woman #8217;s Health. At the risk of repetition, we remind the reader of the standards we described above. In Whole Woman #8217;s Health, we quoted Casey in explaining that  #8220; #8216;a statute which, while furthering [a] valid state interest has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman #8217;s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends. #8217; #8221; . . . . We added that  #8220;  #8216;[u]nnecessary health regulations #8217; #8221; impose an unconstitutional  #8220; #8216;undue burden #8217; #8221; if they have  #8220; #8216;the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion. #8217; #8221; Breyer agreed that even if the law "could be said to further women #8217;s health to some marginal degree, the burdens it imposes far outweigh any such benefit, and thus the Act imposes an unconstitutional undue burden. #8221; He explained,  #8220;The evidence shows, among other things, that the fact that hospital admissions for abortion are vanishingly rare means that, unless they also maintain active OB/GYN practices, abortion providers in Louisiana are unlikely to have any recent in-hospital experience. #8221; After meticulously reviewing the factual record, he concluded: We conclude, in light of the record, that the District Court #8217;s significant factual findings #8212;both as to burdens and as to benefits #8212;have ample evidentiary support. None is  #8220;clearly erroneous. #8221; Given the facts found, we must also uphold the District Court #8217;s related factual and legal determinations. These include its determination that Louisiana #8217;s law poses a  #8220;substantial obstacle #8221; to women seeking an abortion; its determination that the law offers no significant health-related benefits; and its determination that the law consequently imposes an  #8220;undue burden #8221; on a woman #8217;s constitutional right to choose to have an abortion. We also agree with its ultimate legal conclusion that, in light of these findings and our precedents, [the Louisiana law] violates the Constitution. Given the 5-to-4 decision, it is Roberts #8217;s concurrence that is decisive. He writes,  #8220;The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana #8217;s law cannot stand under our precedents. #8221; This is his effort to prevent the court from acting as a legal weather vane, flipping with the political winds and thereby removing confidence that the court is acting on legal, not political, principles. He concludes:  #8220;Stare decisis instructs us to treat like cases alike. The result in this case is controlled by our decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law. The Louisiana law burdens women seeking previability abortions to the same extent as the Texas law, according to factual findings that are not clearly erroneous. #8221; Even though Roberts voted to uphold the Texas law, he acts here as the institutional voice of the court. The court will not be used on his watch as a vehicle to enact major policy shifts by one party or another. The long line of cases behind the Texas law from Roe to Casey to Whole Woman #8217;s Health is not one Roberts was willing to disturb. ( #8220;The doctrine also brings pragmatic benefits. Respect for precedent  #8216;promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. #8217; ... It is the  #8216;means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion. #8217;  #8221;) For now, Roberts has thwarted the right #8217;s hope to uproot 45 years of precedent. That effort, however, will last only so long as five justices respectful of precedent remain on the court. Within the next four years, at least one of the five is likely to leave the court either by death or retirement. Thus, the 2020 election remains, among other things, a referendum on whether the right #8217;s long-sought legal revolution and social agenda will succeed."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Covid-19 cases are surging in states that took Donald Trump #8217;s advice and reopened for business too soon. This new surge  #8212; is it OK now to call it a second wave?  #8212; is, on average, hitting people younger than the initial surge in the Northeast did. Perhaps as a result, rising infections haven #8217;t been reflected in a comparable rise in deaths, although that may be only a matter of time. There is, however, growing evidence that even those who survive Covid-19 can suffer long-term adverse effects: scarred lungs, damaged hearts and perhaps neurological disorders. And if the Trump administration gets its way, there may be another source of long-term damage: permanent inability to get health insurance. Remarkably, last week the administration reaffirmed its support for a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which would, among other things, eliminate protection for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions. If the suit were to succeed, having had Covid-19 would surely be one of the pre-existing conditions making health insurance hard, perhaps impossible, to get. Now, the legal argument behind the case is beyond flimsy: The lawsuit claims that the 2017 tax cut effectively invalidated the act, even though that was no part of Congress #8217;s intention. But with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, nobody knows what will happen. And Trump #8217;s support for the suit makes it clear that if re-elected he will do all he can to destroy Obamacare. Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. Not to worry, says the president. In tweets over the weekend he insisted that he would come up with an alternative to Obamacare that would be  #8220;FAR BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE #8221; while protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions. But he #8217;s been claiming to have a much better alternative to Obamacare since he took office. Republicans in Congress, who voted to repeal Obamacare 70 times during the Obama years, have been making the same claim for more than a decade. Yet somehow the great alternative to the Affordable Care Act has never materialized. In 2017, when the G.O.P. finally came close to repealing the act  #8212; failing thanks only to a last-minute change of heart on the part of Senator John McCain  #8212; the plan on offer would have stripped away protection for pre-existing conditions and added 23 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured. In other words, Republicans #8217; insistence that they have a superior alternative to Obamacare is a zombie lie  #8212; a claim that should be dead after having been proved false again and again, but it is still shambling along, eating people #8217;s brains. But why can #8217;t Republicans come up with a better alternative to Obamacare? Are they just incompetent? Possibly  #8212; but even if they did know what they were doing, they couldn #8217;t produce a superior plan, because no such plan is possible. In particular, unless you #8217;re willing to move left instead of right, by going for single payer, the only way to guarantee coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions is a system that looks a lot like Obamacare. The logic here has been clear from the beginning. To ensure coverage of people with pre-existing conditions, you have to prohibit insurers from discriminating based on medical history. But that #8217;s not enough: To provide a decent risk pool, you also have to induce healthy people to sign up, preferably with both subsidies and a penalty for being uninsured. In other words, you need a system that is basically Obamacare. The 2017 tax cut, which did away with the individual mandate  #8212; the penalty for noninsurance  #8212; weakened the system; you can see this by the fact that states, like New Jersey, that imposed their own mandates saw a drop in insurance premiums. But the design of the subsidies, which insulated most people from rising premiums, contained the damage: The percentage of Americans without health insurance, which fell sharply as a result of Obamacare, remains near record lows. So is there any alternative to Obamacare? Of course there is. We could go back to being a country in which people with pre-existing conditions and/or low incomes can #8217;t get health insurance, where for a large fraction of the population illness either goes untreated or leads to bankruptcy. That would, in part, mean becoming a country in which Americans who caught Covid-19 during the pandemic would be uninsurable for the rest of their lives. Indeed, turning us back into that kind of country is the G.O.P. #8217;s true goal, and is what will happen if the party gets its way either as a result of the current lawsuit or through legislation during a second Trump term. But Republicans can #8217;t admit that this is their goal. The public overwhelmingly supports protection for Americans with pre-existing conditions, so right-wing politicians have to pretend they can provide that while dismantling the regulations and subsidies such protection requires. And they have to hope that voters won #8217;t remember that they have been promising a plan, but never delivering, for more than a decade. Let #8217;s hope voters are smarter than that. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 70 times and counting, shame on me."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump #8217;s reelection message is that white America is under siege  #8212; that white Americans are on the losing end of a race war. But what if white America  #8212; or, at least, a large chunk of it  #8212; isn #8217;t buying the story that Trump is peddling? This question is thrust upon us by a new report in The Post detailing the events that unfolded after Trump shared a video on Twitter that included a supporter yelling  #8220;white power #8221; at counterprotesters at a retirement community in Florida called The Villages. The White House has spent days making excuses for Trump #8217;s tweet. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has insisted Trump didn #8217;t hear the phrase  #8220;white power #8221; before retweeting the video  #8212; while simultaneously claiming he does watch videos before sharing them with his 83 million followers. The White House is also claiming Trump deleted the tweet after learning of its white supremacist content from advisers and supporters. Yet this took three hours  #8212; apparently Trump couldn #8217;t be reached while golfing  #8212; and the White House has yet to condemn its sentiment. Why no condemnation yet? The Post brings us this, from Monday #8217;s press briefing: As McEnany left the White House briefing room, reporters shouted after her, asking why the president and his advisers had declined to condemn the phrase  #8220;white power #8221;  #8212; but the question was never posed during the news conference, nor did McEnany bring it up. A senior White House official said that had McEnany been asked, she was prepared to say that of course the president condemns white power, white nationalism and racism in any form. But this raises another question: Why aren #8217;t the White House and Trump himself falling all over themselves to affirmatively condemn it as quickly and unequivocally as possible? One assumes the White House  #8212; and perhaps Trump himself  #8212; will ultimately condemn the sentiment. But this new excuse explicitly says McEnany would have clarified that of course Trump condemns it, if she had been asked. So why must they be dragged to this point? No more euphemisms The answer, I think, exposes a weakness in Trump #8217;s reelection effort. With nearly 125,000 Americans dead and cases spiking again from a pandemic that Trump horribly mismanaged, and amid the most pronounced civil upheaval in a half century, Trump #8217;s propagandists want to convert disorder to his advantage. That #8217;s obvious enough. But the true nature of it is often shrouded in euphemisms  #8212; Trump is  #8220;stoking division, #8221; or  #8220;throwing a match on gasoline, #8221; or some such phrase, which implies Trump is a passive bystander to societal conflicts that he #8217;s merely cheering on for cynical purposes. It #8217;s much worse than that. Trump and his propagandists are actively trying to engineer violent civil conflict, by signaling to white Americans that they are under siege in a race war that they #8217;re losing. The rub is that this signaling requires actually saying this in one form or another. And that forces Trump and his propagandists into a position where they must be cagey about his actual intended meanings when he does things like tweet out supporters yelling  #8220;white power. #8221; Trump and his propagandists want a lot of white Americans to think they need to take sides in a race war. They are expressly using the state to feed this impression: Trump and his top law enforcement and national security officials have repeatedly placed the imprimatur of the government on a profound falsification of the true nature of the protests to do so. [Matt Gaetz tweet, accompanied by white gun-toting couple]  #8220;In Joe Biden #8217;s America your job is illegal, you are locked in your home, borders don #8217;t exist, MS-13 lives next door and the police aren #8217;t coming when the mob arrives. This is all of us #8221; But even the very need to get dragged to the point of condemning the  #8220;white power #8221; sentiment is itself a signal in this regard. It #8217;s a wink. It says: We have to be politically correct about this  #8212; double wink  #8212; but we understand why you feel this way. McEnany gave away the game on  #8220;Fox  amp; Friends, #8221; saying this:  #8220;His point in tweeting out that video was to stand with his supporters, who are oftentimes demonized, so he took it down but he does stand with the men and women of The Villages. #8221; The  #8220;demonized #8221; ones, the victimized ones, are his supporters! This trades on a narrative Trump has long employed, as Adam Serwer has detailed, in which Trump signals to supporters that  #8220;they are the true victims of discrimination #8221; and see criticism of Trump #8217;s racism  #8220;as an affirmation of their own victimhood. #8221; We know Trump does not like such retreats. After Trump uttered his  #8220;many fine people #8221; comment about white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, his advisers got him to offer conciliatory remarks. But Trump then raged that this shift made him look  #8220;weak. #8221; In other words, racial strife is good for Trump, as former adviser Stephen K. Bannon has tacitly admitted. Recall, too, that Trump #8217;s campaign provocatively scheduled a rally on Juneteenth on the site of some of the worst racial violence in our history, but did not change the date until after days of criticism. And Trump has repeatedly tarred protests with  #8220;racist tropes, #8221; from tweeting out videos of blacks attacking whites to calling protesters  #8220;THUGS #8221; to threatening to unleash  #8220;vicious dogs #8221; on them, evoking violence against civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The big problem here for Trump, however, is that much of white America is rejecting all of this. As Ron Brownstein exhaustively shows, recent polling shows that educated whites in particular see Trump #8217;s race-war-mongering as a destructive and destabilizing force, which makes efforts to exploit disorder to portray Trump as  #8220;strong #8221; look like an even greater failure. Trump and his propagandists are constantly looking for that sweet spot, in which they #8217;re energizing hard-core supporters by telling them they #8217;re the victims in a race war while retreating just enough from this suggestion to avoid further alienating the white voters he #8217;s already driven away and badly needs back. But, as the latest ham-handed equivocation coming from the White House demonstrates, and as the slide in Trump #8217;s poll numbers even amid the protests has shown, it #8217;s a weak position from which to run for reelection."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>text: "Thinking about the course of the Covid-19 pandemic in America, I found myself remembering Sam Smith #8217;s history of the march to war in Iraq, told entirely in official lies. So here #8217;s a modest attempt to do the same for the coronavirus, with statements from officials and right-wing media. I #8217;ve grouped the statements by topic, and used chronological order within each topic. *The course of the pandemic* We think we have it very well under control. We have contained this. I won #8217;t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. We have done a good job in the United States. It #8217;s going to disappear. One day, like a miracle, it #8217;s going to disappear. At worst  #8212; worst case scenario  #8212; it could be the flu. We #8217;re prepared, and we #8217;re doing a great job with it. It #8217;s going to go away  #8230; when you look at the kind of numbers that you #8217;re seeing coming out of other countries, it #8217;s pretty amazing when you think of it. This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. It looks like we #8217;ll be at about a 60,000 mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of. Minimal numbers were going to be 100,000 people. And we #8217;re going to be, hopefully, far below that. So we have between 100 and 200,000, and we altogether have done a very good job. *Medical treatment* Hydrochloroquine and azithromycin, taken together, have a chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? *Reopening* I would love to have the country opened up and raring to go by Easter. You can #8217;t just come in and say let #8217;s close up the United States of America, the biggest, the most successful country in the world by far. [Caution about reopening] is not an acceptable answer. *The plot against Trump* It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump  #8230; The coronavirus is the common cold, folks. This is yet another attempt to impeach the president. There #8217;s no good reason to keep any part of the country completely closed unless that is, you don #8217;t want America to recover, at least while Trump is president. *Governors* Governor Abbott, when you look at the job he #8217;s doing in Texas, I rely on his judgment. Ron DeSantis had the right coronavirus response  #8212; but the media won #8217;t tell you that. *Testing* Anybody that needs a test, gets a test  #8230; And the tests are beautiful. I don #8217;t take any responsibility at all [for inadequate testing]. We #8217;ve tested more than every country combined. Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases! When you do testing to that extent, you #8217;re going to find more people, you #8217;re going to find more cases. So I said to my people,  #8220;Slow the testing down, please! #8221; *Masks* Can you take [your mask] off, because I cannot hear you  #8230; OK, you want to be politically correct. Masks are a double-edge sword. People touch them. And they grab them and I see it all the time. They come in, they take the mask. Now they #8217;re holding it now in their fingers. And they drop it on the desk and then they touch their eye and they touch their nose.  #8230; I see Biden. It #8217;s like his whole face is covered. It #8217;s like he put a knapsack over his face. It #8217;s his choice to wear a mask. It #8217;s the personal choice of any individual whether to wear a mask or not. *The Sunbelt surge* Cases have stabilized over the past two weeks, with the daily average case rate across the U.S. dropping to 20,000  #8212; down from 30,000 in April and 25,000 in May. There is no second wave coming. It #8217;s just hot spots. *Anthony Fauci, not lying:* We are now having 40-plus-thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "When Mike Judge #8217;s movie  #8220;Idiocracy #8221; came out in 2006, almost no one saw it. (The film grossed less than $500,000 at the box office.) Now everyone should see it. Luke Wilson plays an average Joe who is put into suspended animation and reawakens 500 years later to find himself the smartest person in America because everyone else has gotten so dumb. The No. 1 TV show features contestants being hit in their private parts; crops are watered with a sports energy drink, causing a famine; and the president is a former wrestler and porn star who curses freely and fires automatic weapons on TV. Is there a better prophecy of our end times? The only thing  #8220;Idiocracy #8221; really got wrong was its timeline. It has taken just 15 years, not 500, for America to become an idiocracy. Don #8217;t believe it? Look at our response to the coronavirus pandemic. In other wealthy democracies, coronavirus cases have been plummeting. In the United States, they have risen 80 percent over the past 14 days. On Monday, the United States reported more than 40,000 new cases, while the European Union, which is more populous, had fewer than 6,000. The number of confirmed coronavirus deaths in the United States is approaching 130,000, more than twice as many as in any other country. It is easy, and correct, to blame this epic failure on abysmal leadership. We have an irrational, incompetent president who spent months denying the reality of the disease (remember when he claimed it would  #8220;miraculously #8221; go away by April?), while suggesting cures including a risky malaria drug and bleach injections. Now President Trump is holding rallies in places such as Tulsa, where the disease is surging; campaign aides even removed signs from the arena urging rallygoers to practice social distancing. Trump is planning a Republican convention in a state, Florida, that has become a new hot spot of the disease. How idiotic can you get? The presidency #8217;s idiocy is matched by that of Republican governors in states such as Florida (where coronavirus cases increased by 277 percent in the past two weeks), Texas (+184 percent) and Arizona (+145 percent). They were slow to declare lockdowns and quick to end them. They also refused to impose statewide mask mandates  #8212; and, in the case of Texas and Arizona, tried to prevent municipalities from imposing their own rules  #8212; even though studies show that wearing masks can reduce transmission by as much as 85 percent. This toxic imbecility is getting people killed. But recall the adage that  #8220;every nation gets the government it deserves. #8221; Trump and the Trumpy governors did not seize power by force. They were elected by constituents who, in some cases, see masks as the spawn of the devil. An Ohio state legislator said,  #8220;I don #8217;t want to cover people #8217;s faces #8221; because  #8220;we #8217;re created in the image and likeness of God. #8221; A Palm Beach, Fla., woman complained that masks  #8220;throw God #8217;s wonderful breathing system out the door, #8221; while a fellow Palm Beach resident denounced mask advocates for  #8220;practicing the Devil #8217;s law. #8221; A North Carolina woman burned a mask, complaining that it represented  #8220;nanny state overreach. #8221; Wait till these freedom-lovers find out about speeding laws, seat-belt laws and drunken-driving laws, which restrict their  #8220;right #8221; to get wasted and careen down the highway at 95 mph without a seat belt. Granted, few Americans are as maniacal in their opposition to the basic dictates of public health. But far greater numbers seem recklessly indifferent to them. A 30-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., man went drinking with his buddies and even shared drinks with them in a  #8220;super packed #8221; bar. A few days later, he woke up with a 103-degree temperature.  #8220;I didn #8217;t take this seriously, #8221; Jimmy Flores now admits.  #8220;I didn #8217;t think I was gonna get covid. #8221; There are a lot of Jimmys. While two-thirds of Americans told Pew Research Center pollsters that they wear masks in stores or other businesses, fewer than half say most people in their area do so. And far fewer Republicans or lean-Republicans (72 percent) than Democrats or lean-Democrats (88 percent) say they wear masks all or some of the time in those settings. Trump won 62.9 million votes in 2016. If only a third of Trump #8217;s supporters refuse to wear masks, that #8217;s roughly 19 million Americans who are potential superspreaders. Add roughly 8 million similarly irresponsible Democrats  #8212; most of them presumably young and clueless  #8212; and you have the makings of an out-of-control pandemic. We can and should hold our leaders responsible, but ultimately, we have no one but ourselves to blame. Nobody forced so many Americans to act so recklessly  #8212; first by placing their faith in a president who doesn #8217;t deserve it, and now in ignoring widely publicized scientific findings. We are living  #8212; and now dying  #8212; in an idiocracy of our own creation."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: " #8220;What did the president know, and when did he know it? #8221; That evocative question was posed by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) in a news conference Tuesday, speaking of reports that the intelligence community believes Russia has been offering bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. The fact that this is even a question could only happen under this president. But the particular circumstances of this disturbing development raise another, perhaps even more important question: What if the president not only can #8217;t be trusted to always do what is in the interests of the United States as any president should, but can never be trusted to do so? What if he only acts in America #8217;s interests by coincidence, when those interests happen to line up with his own? When the story about the Russian bounties broke on Friday, the White House insisted that Trump knew nothing about it, though they never denied that Russia may have done this. Yet within days, one report after another described how the information has been known  #8212; and sent his way  #8212; for some time. The Associated Press reported that White House officials knew about the bounties in early 2019. CNN reported that the information was included in one of Trump #8217;s  #8220;daily briefings on intelligence matters sometime in the spring. #8221; The Post also reported that it was included in the president #8217;s daily intelligence brief, or PDB. But for now, anyway, the position of the White House is that the president had no idea about any of this.  #8220;Neither the President nor the Vice President were briefed on the alleged Russia  #8212; Russian bounty intelligence, #8221; said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday. She claimed this was because the intelligence wasn #8217;t  #8220;verified, #8221; as though the president is only told about intelligence for which there is incontrovertible proof. Asked whether the president had a message for Moscow in response, McEnany said,  #8220;A specific message for Moscow? No, because he has not been briefed on the matter. #8221; If true, this would mean that days after these reports had come out, Trump still had not been informed of what the intel community knows about the Russian bounties. But one must understand the context, which is that Trump #8217;s intelligence briefings are a kind of surreal comedy routine in which professionals try to figure out some way to inject vital information into the brain of a president determined not to hear it, no matter what it #8217;s about. Early in his presidency, it was reported that Trump is essentially incapable of reading anything much longer than a page or two, so briefers put in fun pictures and graphs to hold his attention (yet even now he still prefers to get information from conservative media). Briefers also learned to repeat his name in  #8220;as many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if he #8217;s mentioned, #8221; as one source told Reuters. In addition  #8212; and most important when it comes to Russia  #8212; he grows angry if he #8217;s told anything that contradicts what he believes or what he has said in public. So the answer to the mystery of what Trump knew and when he knew it is one of the following: 1. Intelligence officials, knowing that Trump would react negatively to information that cast the Kremlin in a bad light, decided not to tell him about the bounties. 2. Trump was informed in his written PDB that Russia was offering these bounties, but didn #8217;t read it. 3. He read it, but promptly forgot it. 4. He was told verbally, but forgot it. 5. He was informed in the written PDB and/or verbally, but didn #8217;t like what he heard so he decided to ignore it, and is now having aides lie about it. While all of these are at least theoretically possible, the last option is the one that lines up most closely with the information we have as of now. Now let #8217;s turn to a remarkable CNN story by Carl Bernstein. In his calls with foreign leaders, Bernstein reports, Trump is unprepared, easily manipulated, abusive to allies and simply idiotic, to the point where senior officials believe he is  #8220;delusional #8221; and  #8220;a danger to the national security of the United States. #8221; Some of the stories are merely vulgar, such as when he told German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who happens to have a PhD in quantum chemistry, that she #8217;s  #8220;stupid. #8221; But when it comes to Vladimir Putin, aides describe Trump as  #8220;inordinately solicitous of Putin #8217;s admiration and seemingly seeking his approval. #8221; Particularly relevant is an early call with the Russian dictator, after which Trump ignored the assessment of those who actually knew Putin  #8212; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Russia expert Fiona Hill and national security adviser H.R. McMaster  #8212; preferring instead to bask in praise from his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner about how gloriously he had performed:  #8216;McMaster viewed that early phone call with Putin as indicative of the conduct of the whole relationship between Russia and the Trump administration, according to the sources  #8212; a conclusion subsequent national security advisers and chiefs of staff, and numerous high-ranking intelligence officials also reached: unlike in previous administrations, there were relatively few meaningful dealings between military and diplomatic professionals, even at the highest levels, because Trump  #8212; distrustful of the experts and dismissive of their attempts to brief him  #8212; conducted the relationship largely ad hoc with Putin and almost totally by himself. Ultimately, Putin and the Russians learned that  #8220;nobody has the authority to do anything #8221;  #8212; and the Russian leader used that insight to his advantage, as one of CNN #8217;s sources said. #8217; As Rep. Hoyer said at the news conference, the question is whether the relationship of the United States to Russia  #8220;is compromised by the relationship between the president and Mr. Putin. #8221; Is there a single person who could honestly say otherwise? That Trump #8217;s decisions about Russia are based solely on the best interests of the United States and not on his pathetic desire to ingratiate himself with Putin? If there was ever any doubt, we know now that Trump #8217;s attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into helping him win reelection, an action for which he was impeached, wasn #8217;t an aberration. It was the pure expression of the way he conducts foreign policy. And it will be some time before we understand the full extent of the damage."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (edited and shortened for length): " #8220;Being president, #8221; former First Lady Michelle Obama has said,  #8220;doesn #8217;t change who you are, it reveals who you are. #8221; In this moment, we may also need to acknowledge that presidents also reveal much about who we are. American presidents do not exist outside the systems or times that produced them. Great presidents #8212;like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and, arguably, Lyndon B. Johnson #8212;have emerged when the nation has risen to meet challenging circumstances. And, granted, most presidents are middling #8212;which tells us something about the quotidian nature of much of political life in the US. But America #8217;s worst presidents demonstrate something essential about what is most broken or troubling in the character of the country and the temper of the times. A dismal or dire US president is a symptom of great problems within society that weaken it or put it in peril. In this year of a presidential election, we must account for our forty-fifth president because the real challenge before us is not simply to replace a terribly flawed leader, but to understand how to fix a system that produces, promotes, protects, and even values the dangerous toxicity we see daily from our commander-in-chief. It has been said that one of the most important ingredients for a successful career is wisdom in choosing the right predecessor: if the one who came before was bad enough, the one who comes after is almost certain to look better by comparison. This may be some consolation to whomever is Donald Trump #8217;s successor #8212;it certainly worked to the advantage of George Washington. As much as the United States was founded on ideals, it was also established in response to the manifold failings of King George III. The British monarch is, in fact, the defining bad leader of American history. He and the system over which he presided were so dire that they fundamentally shaped our idea of what a leader should and shouldn #8217;t be #8212;inspiring Thomas Paine, the English radical who arrived on these shores in 1774, to compose Common Sense, the definitive condemnation of England #8217;s abuses and an argument for breaking with the country. Paine wrote of kings (and, we might add, by extension those born into privilege at any time): Men who look upon themselves as born to reign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest of mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the world they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and when they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions. The Declaration of Independence, published only months after Paine #8217;s pamphlet, was itself primarily a denunciation of George III. The crux of the document is a section devoted to his wrongs #8212; #8220;a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States #8221; #8212;a litany of twenty-seven separate complaints about his rule. George is condemned for, among other offenses, having refused to approve laws that are  #8220;necessary for the public good, #8221; for bullying governors, for blocking reasonable legislative progress, for blocking immigration to the states, for  #8220;obstructing the Administration of Justice, #8221; for bending the judiciary to his will, for seeking to make the military  #8220;independent of and superior to the Civil Power, #8221; for conspiring  #8220;with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, #8221;  #8220;for cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world, #8221; and for having  #8220;excited domestic insurrections amongst us. #8221; Any of those grievances sound familiar? During the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Representatives Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler both cited a letter Alexander Hamilton wrote to George Washington warning that:  #8220;When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits #8212;despotic in his ordinary demeanour #8212;known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty #8212;when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity #8212;to join in the cry of danger to liberty #8212;to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government  amp; bringing it under suspicion #8212;to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day #8212;It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may  #8220;ride the storm and direct the whirlwind. #8221; Hamilton also observed that  #8220;the only path to a subversion of the republican system of the Country is, by flattering the prejudices of the people, and exciting their jealousies and apprehensions, to throw affairs into confusion, and bring on civil commotion. #8221; And it was Washington, our first president, who noted in turn that, for the republic to succeed,  #8220;the form of government must be supported by a virtuous citizenry. #8221; The Founders saw that good governance required leaders and citizens of good character, and realized neither was a given. Should we conclude, then, that Donald Trump is the embodiment of the Founders #8217; worst fears? It is one thing to compare Trump to others who have held the country #8217;s highest office, but as the Founders also pointed out, the fate of the country rests in the hands of those who ultimately wield the power of government in our shaken but still standing republican system: the people. Many may despise those aspects of our society embodied in Trump #8217;s presidency, but in a democracy it is up to us to work to correct what is wrong with our communities. If we have a president who is selfish, ignorant, venal, dishonest, racist, misogynist, and corrupt, what does it tell us that a significant minority of American citizens celebrates such a leader, while another segment of our compatriots are willing to tolerate them, at least enough to give him their votes?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump #8217;s defense of white nationalism  #8212; from his glorification of Confederate statues to his refusal to acknowledge, let alone address, systemic racism to his demonization of immigrants  #8212; is immoral and un-American. Moreover, both the message and the mass events he uses to propagate it are unsustainable as the basis for a presidential campaign. Here are 10 reasons why:  #8226; If left-wing mobs are attacking the country, why doesn #8217;t/hasn #8217;t Trump done something about it? He #8217;s president after all.  #8226; Does Trump have a plan (beyond statues) to address this non-problem? (Hint: It #8217;s not a problem; it #8217;s not  #8220;solvable #8221;; and it offers nothing but a conduit for bile.) A president is expected to govern, not simply to vent.  #8226; Why should Americans care about statues when some 127,000 people are dead from covid-19 and unemployment is in double digits? His obsession seems especially bizarre given that the country is experiencing actual carnage thanks to his incompetent response.  #8226; Since no significant violence is perceptible, how does he sustain the illusion that his followers are under siege? (Watching a crowd tear down a Confederate monument or two is not exactly bloodcurdling.)  #8226; What states can be won without nonwhite voters, college-educated voters, young voters and suburban women (granted, there is some overlap among these) for whom his message is repulsive? (He can hold his racial-grievance sessions in red states such as Oklahoma and South Dakota, but how do his messages play in states that are actually in contention?)  #8226; Who are these Democrats that he claims support violence? (I haven #8217;t seen any of them on the ballot.) Does anyone outside his cult think former vice president Joe Biden defends mayhem?  #8226; What will Trump do when events he needs to spread his message of racial grievance and belligerent opposition to medical expertise add to the pandemic death toll (since they are held without mandatory masks and social distancing)?  #8226; With states such as Texas and Pennsylvania requiring masks and/or banning mass events, will Trump appear and break the law, stay away or capitulate to health experts?  #8226; Will any incumbent Senate Republican in a competitive race (e.g., Maine, North Carolina, Colorado, Montana, Georgia, Arizona, Iowa) appear with him? While Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) can be counted on to regurgitate Trump #8217;s message of white grievance, does Trump plan on throwing overboard any Republican who won #8217;t?  #8226; As corporate boycotts pressure Facebook to police hate speech and Washington #8217;s NFL football team to pick a name that is not racially offensive, what happens when Trump #8217;s donors and surrogates (not to mention right-wing media outlets) come under similar pressure to sever ties with him? Trump is running a campaign akin to George Wallace #8217;s in 1968, when he denounced  #8220;a few anarchists, a few activists, a few militants, a few revolutionaries, and a few Communists  #8230; [whose day] is going to be over soon. #8221; If you think I exaggerate, consider that Wallace in 1968 declared,  #8220;The American people are not going to stand by and see the security of our nation imperiled, and they #8217;re not going to stand by and see this nation destroyed, I can assure you that. #8221; Wallace insisted, in words that are eerily familiar to voters who listen to Trump:  #8220;The pseudo-intellectuals and the theoreticians and some professors and some newspaper editors and some judges and some preachers have looked down their nose long enough at the average man on the street. #8221; Fifty-two years later, Trump #8217;s rhetoric has even less currency than such assertions did in Wallace #8217;s era. The country is different. The electorate is different. And the rhetoric of subversion, violence and fear does not really work when you are the one in power and responsible for keeping Americans secure and safe. And on that score, voters are all too aware that Trump has not kept them safe from death, sickness or economic distress. Trump #8217;s bet that Americans are racist and oblivious is a poor one."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump dismissed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States over the weekend, downplaying the impact of the disease and saying that while the testing of tens of millions of American had identified many cases,  #8220;99 percent #8221; of them were  #8220;totally harmless. #8221; His remarks about a virus that has already claimed nearly 130,000 lives were perplexing. The coronavirus is surging across the Sunbelt states and has rebounded in California. At least 2.8 million Americans are known to be infected, and public health officials have said the real number of infections may be 10 times higher. WHAT WAS SAID Likewise, testing  #8212; there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested over 40 million people. But by so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country will show, because no other country has testing that we have  #8212; not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. False. No matter how you define harmless, most public health experts and respected coronavirus disease models would flatly contradict Mr. Trump #8217;s assessment. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Calculating the toll of a rapidly moving pandemic while it is still raging is a Sisyphean feat, with outbreaks popping up in different parts of the country, even as improvements in care and new therapies curb mortality rates. Latest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 11m ago The outlook worsens in much of the U.S. as July begins with a crush of cases. Medical groups urge Americans to  #8216;resist confusing reopening with returning to normalcy. #8217; The fullest look yet at the racial inequity of the virus in the U.S. See more updates More live coverage: Markets Experts say the president appears to have seized only on a death rate estimate of 1 percent or less that does not capture the entire impact of the disease, and excludes a multitude of thousands who have spent weeks in the hospital or weeks at home with mild to moderate symptoms that still caused debilitating health problems. That death rate is narrowly focused on the number of people who die as a percentage of the total number of people affected  #8212; including those who are asymptomatic and do not experience any illness, and those with mild cases, who experience fleeting symptoms. A crude calculation of the U.S. death rate, based on the total number of deaths officially attributed to the virus and the number of cases diagnosed through testing, suggests the mortality rate is higher, with 4.5 percent of those infected dying. But many experts agree that this rate is very likely inflated, because the denominator at this point in time has missed so many cases, including those who were never diagnosed because of testing shortages as well as those who were asymptomatic. And some experts pointed out that even those who tested positive but show no symptoms should not be considered cases that are harmless  #8212; they can unwittingly transmit the virus to others in the community who are more vulnerable and may develop an acute illness. Editors #8217; Picks In the Covid-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job. You Can #8217;t Have Both. The Fall of Jeff Sessions, and What Came After What Do You Do When Extremism Comes for the Hawaiian Shirt? Advertisement Continue reading the main story Studies that have calculated the death rate based on broader antibody testing that takes these silent cases into consideration suggest an infection death rate of less than 1 percent, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.  #8220;It #8217;s always tricky to do this in the midst of a pandemic, #8221; Dr. Jha said.  #8220;There are a lot of factors that go into it. But let #8217;s say you took 1,000 Americans at random who were all infected. Our best guess is that between six and 10 would likely die of the virus. #8221; And the death rate does not capture all of the harm caused by the disease. As many as 15 to 20 percent of known Covid-19 patients may require hospitalization, and of the group admitted, 15 to 20 percent are transferred into intensive care, according to some estimates. In addition to hospitalization, another consideration that would complicate what defines harmlessness is the long-term implication for so many who have recovered or are still struggling to regain their pre-Covid lives. Patients fortunate enough to survive a lengthy hospitalization and weeks in an intensive care unit or on a ventilator face a long road to recovery. Many will suffer debilitating long-term effects, including impaired lung function, neurological problems and cognitive deficits, and some may require lifelong care and not regain full independence. Some patients have prolonged courses of illness, with fevers and weakness that lasts for weeks on end; the disease has also been linked to strokes that can be disabling, and much about how the disease affects the immune system long term is still unknown. Residual symptoms such as continuing shortness of breath, muscle weakness, flashbacks and mental fogginess can persist for some time.  #8220;We don #8217;t fully appreciate the long-term consequences of having Covid, even mild and moderate forms of Covid that were never admitted to the hospital, #8221; said Dr. Thomas McGinn, the deputy physician in chief at Northwell Health and director of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, who is studying the disease #8217;s long-term effects. Advertisement Continue reading the main story  #8220;Are there lingering effects lasting three months, six months, a year or longer? The question of what percent have long-term consequences, and the severity of the consequences, are unclear, #8221; Dr. McGinn said.  #8220;We #8217;ve definitely seen people who have lung scarring and gone home with fibrotic changes in their lungs who have continued difficulty with breathing. And there are people who three months out have lingering changes with their sense of taste and smell. That #8217;s not a small problem. People depend on smell and taste to enjoy life. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "This is how you accurately describe President Trump #8217;s latest actions:  #8220;Instead of working around the clock on [the pandemic], visiting hospitals, rallying the troops, rallying the public to wear masks, fight complacency, care for elderly and the sick, this president is simply declaring victory, declaring [the novel coronavirus] 99 percent harmless instead of talking about the virus and doing things about it. He #8217;s spending his time to trying to distract now with racist and jingoistic talk. He #8217;s just leaning full into the racist he #8217;s long been; he #8217;s just letting us see it more clearly now than ever before. #8221; That was Anderson Cooper on CNN Monday night. Clear declarative sentences that accurately label the president #8217;s words. Is it so hard for others to do the same? This is not how you accurately depict Trump:  #8220;For many Republicans who are watching the president #8217;s impact on Senate races with alarm, his focus on racial and cultural flash points  #8212; and not on the surge of the coronavirus in many states  #8212; is distressing. #8221; This was how the New York Times obliquely described Trump #8217;s defense of the Confederate flag, his attack on African American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, his rants against peaceful protesters seeking to halt the murder of African Americans by police and his insistence that some Americans are out to destroy the country. I don #8217;t know what it means to  #8220;focus on racial and cultural flash points. #8221; Trump is not conducting a seminar on race and culture. He is not calling attention to violence against racial minorities. He is making racist statements and venerating racist symbols. Period. Phrases such as  #8220;racially charged #8221; or  #8220;racially sensitive #8221; should be dropped from journalists #8217; lexicon.  #8220;Raising racial tensions #8221; is devoid of meaning. Trump is saying racist things. It is part of decades of racist rhetoric. Let #8217;s not mince words. Journalists should not construct tortured sentences to make racism appear as an unfortunate and perhaps accidental byproduct of his rhetoric. Try diagramming this sentence from the Times:  #8220;Mr. Trump has sought to stoke white fear and resentment, portraying himself as a protector of an old order that polls show much of America believes perpetuates entrenched racism and wants to move beyond. #8221; That verges on self-parody.  #8220;Trump fans racism. #8221; Period. And when the media generously describe Republicans as  #8220;bothered #8221; or  #8220;uneasy #8221; about Trump #8217;s blatant racism, they exaggerate Republicans #8217; reaction and distort reality. The overwhelming number of elected Republicans do not say and do not act as though they are bothered or uneasy. The few Republican voices (other than openly Never Trumpers) whom mainstream reporters dig up to say negative things about Trump are generally retired pols (e.g., former congressman Carlos Curbelo) and lesser-known strategists who do not really take Trump on as much as they disagree with his premises and assertions, as if racist words and accusations are floating free in the atmosphere, untethered to a particular person. Let #8217;s be accurate: Whatever personal qualms they might have, virtually every elected Republican either ignores, rationalizes or minimizes Trump #8217;s racist appeals. This phony restraint and aversion to candor are reminiscent of the queasiness among some mainstream outlets over the past four years about using the word  #8220;lie #8221; in association with a president who incessantly repeats falsehoods long after they are debunked. He lies about easily established facts. He lies about his own record and comments. He lies about the economy. He lies about virtually any topic. Racists and liars are enabled and protected from accountability when the media mince words in describing their language. It is those who are already the victims of racial injustice, brutality and persecution who are hurt the most when the media bob and weave, sidestepping unpleasant but true descriptions of their oppressors. I pray we will finally respond to protesters #8217; demands for racial justice, but in the meantime, can we at least be clear about the identity and tactics of their persecutors?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "Some voters who disliked both nominees in 2016 chose a third-party candidate instead. Now, many of them are shunning President Trump and are ready to back Joe Biden. In Florida in 2016, J.C. Planas, a former Republican state representative, was uncomfortable with Hillary Clinton but detested Donald Trump, so he wrote in former Gov. Jeb Bush for president. In New Hampshire that year, Peter J. Spaulding, a longtime Republican official, supported the Libertarian ticket. And in Arizona, Lorena Burns, 56, also voted third party, seeing the choice between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton as a contest between  #8220;two bads. #8221;  #8220;I didn #8217;t want to be responsible for either, #8221; she said. This year, all three of them intend to diverge from their Republican leanings and vote for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee. They are among an emerging group of voters who disliked both major-party presidential nominees in 2016, but who are now so disillusioned with President Trump  #8212; and sufficiently comfortable with Mr. Biden  #8212; that they are increasingly willing to support the Democrat. It #8217;s a dynamic that could have significant implications in several of the most competitive battleground states, like Arizona and Wisconsin, where the third-party vote in 2016 was greater than the margin of difference between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. Recent polling also shows that Mr. Biden has an overwhelming advantage over Mr. Trump among voters who have unfavorable views of both candidates  #8212; a cohort that ultimately broke in Mr. Trump #8217;s favor in 2016, exit polls showed. Ms. Burns of Guadalupe, Ariz., said she recently made her first political donation, to the Democratic National Committee. She said she agreed with many of Mr. Trump #8217;s policies, but was turned off by his behavior.  #8220;Just the lying, just the craziness, the bullying  #8212; I #8217;d rather pay more money than be with him for another four years, #8221; she said.  #8220;I #8217;m willing to pay more money in taxes just to be away from him. He #8217;s corrupting the country. #8221; In Ms. Burns #8217;s state of Arizona, Mr. Trump won by 3.5 percentage points in 2016. The Libertarian Party nominee, Gary Johnson, won 4.1 percent of the vote, and in other states where the race was even closer  #8212; including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida  #8212; he pulled in between 2 and 4 percent. The Green Party candidate Jill Stein took in roughly 1 percent in those states  #8212; small but significant totals in contests that were decided by slim margins. In any single poll, it is difficult for pollsters to reach a significant number of voters who supported third-party candidates in 2016, making it impossible to trace their preferences now. And Mr. Trump  #8212; who faced vocal opposition that year from some prominent Republicans and won anyway  #8212; remains overwhelmingly popular with Republican voters. While many center-right voters have distanced themselves from his party, there are others who initially expressed misgivings about him and have since come to embrace him, resistant to the leftward drift of the Democratic Party. But in a year when swing voters are scarce, some of the voters who effectively stayed on the sidelines in 2016 are showing signs of political movement now  #8212; and there is evidence that Mr. Biden stands to benefit. ImageGary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, won between 2 and 4 percent of votes in close states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida in 2016. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, won between 2 and 4 percent of votes in close states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida in 2016.Credit...Patrick Breen/Santa Fe New Mexican, via Associated Press There appears to be far less interest in third-party candidates compared with the same point in 2016, pollsters say.  #8220;Barring some unforeseen circumstance, there #8217;s just not a lot of appetite for third party, #8221; said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.  #8220;This is two-person for nearly all American voters. #8221; His polling from late June found that among voters who have unfavorable views of both candidates, Mr. Biden leads the president 55 percent to 21 percent. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the voters who disliked both candidates, according to exit polls. And according to a recent poll of registered voters in six major battleground states by The Times and Siena College, people who say they did not vote in 2016 overwhelmingly favor Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump in November, 56 percent to 25 percent. Among registered voters in those states who said they did cast ballots in 2016, 47 percent said they planned to support Mr. Biden and 42 percent said they would back Mr. Trump The Monmouth poll also found that at this point,  #8220;fewer voters have a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee #8221; compared with four years ago.  #8220;You had two lightning rod candidates running last time, #8221; said the veteran Republican pollster Glen Bolger, who added that there was still time for Republicans to shape perceptions of Mr. Biden.  #8220;At this point in time, Joe Biden isn #8217;t nearly as controversial as Hillary Clinton was, so I think third party candidates are a little bit slower to come out of the woodwork. #8221; In 2016, voters who went third party spanned the ideological spectrum, from Republicans who did not believe Mr. Trump was a true conservative, to progressives who opposed Mrs. Clinton from the left. The Biden campaign has been working to improve Mr. Biden #8217;s standing with young liberals, aware of the need to engage and mobilize those voters who have long been skeptical of his relatively centrist policy stances. In part because of his difficulty gaining the confidence of young voters and liberals, Mr. Biden #8217;s net favorability rating nationwide remains stuck close to zero."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "Senior White House economic official Larry Kudlow told reporters last week that the administration wants to approve new tax breaks for baseball games to encourage Americans to return to the ballpark. The next day, Minor League Baseball announced it would play no additional games this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The future of Major League Baseball looks up in the air, too, with several league stars opting out of the season recently over fears of spreading the virus and the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros canceling workouts on Monday due to problems with testing. Fans won #8217;t even be allowed to attend the truncated baseball season when it starts later this month, at least initially.  #8220;It #8217;s a little weird to see the administration discuss something like a tax credit, when essentially no team has announced a policy on even bringing fans back to the ballpark this year, #8221; said one official involved in baseball operations at a Major League Baseball franchise, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss industry reaction. President Trump and White House economists have pushed a range of tax breaks intended to prod Americans to return to normal economic life and revive battered industries. Trump has endorsed an  #8220;Explore America #8221; tax credit that would give Americans a federal reimbursement for taking vacations in the United States. The president has told restaurateurs that he wants a tax break that would allow companies to claim a tax deduction off employee meal expenses. He has pushed similar tax deductions for the entertainment industry. But there are growing signs that the tax breaks the White House wants to use could fall flat, because many of the venues it is eyeing  #8212; such as sporting events and certain restaurants  #8212; are either closed or operating in a much different manner than they were before the outbreak. The push reflects White House officials #8217; long-standing faith in the power of tax cuts to spur economic growth, as well as their broader demands for a suite of tax cuts in the next stimulus package. Many economists  #8212; including some analysts in the industries those credits are intended to help  #8212; say these efforts are unlikely to prove successful as long as the pandemic continues to rage across the country. Huge swaths of the United States are still struggling to contain the virus. Miami-Dade County in Florida, for instance, announced the closures of casinos, movie theaters, restaurants and gyms amid a surge in new cases.  #8220;Reducing the after-tax cost of taking a vacation is not going to address people #8217;s fears of getting the virus while on vacation, #8221; said Kyle Pomerleau, tax policy expert at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.  #8220;That is the fundamental issue facing these industries, and what the White House needs to understand. #8221; With no path forward amid coronavirus pandemic, Minor League Baseball cancels 2020 season The president and the White House have for months talked about providing industry-specific tax breaks or incentives, demanding their inclusion in the next congressional stimulus package. The White House has said it is focused both on spurring economic growth and quashing the virus. The president celebrated a drop in unemployment numbers to 11 percent and said the White House will be  #8220;putting out the flames #8221; in areas where the coronavirus is spiking.  #8220;In preparation for a phase four package, the White House continues to review pro-growth economic measures that provide tax and regulatory relief and incentivize employers to bring back their hardworking employees safely to good-paying jobs, #8221; White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email. Expanded tax deductions have figured prominently in their set of demands for the next package. At the White House in April, Trump urged that the United States  #8220;go back to the original #8221; version of a tax deduction for entertainment and meals. Before the 1990s, companies could deduct 80 percent of their employee costs on entertainment and recreation, including meals, provided they were related to  #8220;business activities. #8221; That number was decreased to a 50 percent deduction in a bill passed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. The 2017 Republican tax law further shrunk the loophole to offset the price tag of that legislation #8217;s enormous reduction in corporate taxes. The Republican law zeroed out the deduction on entertainment and recreation, although it left intact the 50 percent deduction on the cost of business meals. A White House spokesman did not clarify the exact nature of the administration #8217;s plan.  #8220;Restaurants and entertainment  #8212; and that would include sports leagues, all forms of entertainment  #8212; go back to the original, where they get tax deductibility for what they #8217;re doing and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals. And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time otherwise opening, #8221; the president said in April.  #8220;And that could be the same for the sports leagues. #8221; The president added:  #8220;They #8217;ll send their executives, they #8217;ll send people there, and they get a deduction. That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants; I think make them hotter than before. You know, they used to have it. And when they ended it, it was really never the same. It was never the same. #8221; The president returned to the deduction unprompted during a May roundtable with restaurant executives who had been pushing the administration for additional forgiveness on their small-business loans.  #8220;I think it #8217;s, frankly, more important than even the other things we #8217;re talking about, #8221; the president said of restoring the deduction.  #8220;I guess, short term, what you #8217;re talking about, is more important, but long-term, the deduction would be phenomenal. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Republicans and former Republicans at the Lincoln Project may be the most famous and revered ad-makers right now. When Trump Republicans scowl that they #8217;ll never let the Lincoln Project folks back into the party, I am confident the latter get a good belly laugh. (It #8217;s akin to telling Bill Gates he won #8217;t be welcome at the high school computer club. Why would he want in?) It #8217;s not clear the Lincoln Project folks want back in, and, in any event, they surely won #8217;t have trouble getting future business. Their latest ad going after Trump enablers in the Senate is deliciously satisfying for those who have watched Republicans twist themselves into pretzels to ignore, rationalize or minimize the damage President Trump has done to the country. Since all but Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) voted to acquit Trump at his impeachment trial  #8212; thereby leaving him in place to bollix up the coronavirus pandemic, continue currying favor with Vladimir Putin, enact revenge against decent, honorable Americans (including Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who resigned from the military on Wednesday)  #8212; they all share responsibility for the horrors unfolding before us. It is constitutionally and morally essential to hold them accountable for their cowardly refusal to uphold their oaths. The Lincoln Project wants us to remember who they are: [Lincoln Project tweet of new video] The ad is powerful and has practical value in the near, intermediate and long terms. In the current climate, attacks on their sycophantic loyalty to Trump (along with their atrocious polling) might prod them into doing some constructive things (e.g., passing the Heroes Act, demanding an accounting of the Russian bounties on U.S. military forces). Over the next few months, it may encourage them to run from Trump, changing their election message to  #8220;Don #8217;t give former vice president Joe Biden Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress #8221; and sealing the impression that he is a hopeless cause (which in turn will scare off donors). The most important consequence of the ad, however, is the long-term statement: If you supported Trump, your political career should end. This is likely only the beginning of efforts to clear the decks in the Republican Party  #8212; for those interested in rebuilding it. Trump is not the only person who must lose if the party is to be rescued; the partners in Trumpism must go down with him. (In my mind, it will require such a thorough transformation you might as well start over with a new name and logo. The  #8220;Lincoln Party #8221; or the  #8220;Union Party #8221; might work). If one believes there should be no place in U.S. politics for a party built on white grievance, contempt for truth and just plain meanness, it is necessary to show that the problem was just not Trump but the men and women who went along with the cult, the lies, the worship of the Confederacy, the attacks on the rule of law and the xenophobia. There is also, of course, the practical outcome: If you want Biden to govern closer to the center and repair the damage to the country and our democracy (e.g., pass voting rights reform, depoliticize the Justice Department, enact anti-corruption legislation) and succeed in a reform agenda (e.g., comprehensive immigration reform), it is best to give him a Senate majority including moderate senators from swing and red states  #8212; Colorado, North Carolina, Montana, Georgia, Maine  #8212; he can work with. (Republicans have proven over and over again they are unwilling to do anything but obstruct a Democratic president, so leaving them with the majority would simply perpetuate dysfunction.) In sum, if you want a functional two-party system and rational governance after 2020, the Trump enablers need to go. Kicking them out would also be a fine way to reestablish a minimal requirement for decency and truthfulness for our public officials. Yes, the Lincoln Party is growing on me."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump periodically tweets about a  #8220;SILENT MAJORITY! #8221;  #8212; a Nixonian phrase suggesting that the media and a small cliche of extremists are against him but that the majority of Americans quietly support his emphasis on, as he would tweet,  #8220;LAW AND ORDER! #8221; In the case of racial justice and police reform, however, both the silent and the not-so-silent majority are at odds with Trump. A new Pew Research poll released Thursday shows the public is very much in favor of eliminating qualified immunity for police officers:  #8220;Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say that civilians need to have the power to sue police officers to hold them accountable for misconduct and excessive use of force, even if that makes the officers #8217; jobs more difficult. #8221; Less than a third agree with Trump and Republicans that  #8220;in order for police officers to do their jobs effectively, they need to be shielded from such lawsuits. #8221; This holds across races (86 percent of African Americans and 60 percent of whites favor eliminating qualified immunity), though there are large differences by party affiliation (only 45 percent of Republicans oppose qualified immunity, compared with 84 percent of Democrats). A slew of other proposals also gain majority support:  #8220;90% of the public favors a federal government database to track officers accused of misconduct. Three-quarters support giving civilian oversight boards the power to investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct, and similar shares favor requiring officers to live in the places they police and outlawing police use of chokeholds or strangleholds. #8221; The police have fallen down in the eyes of many Americans when it comes to use of force, equal treatment of suspects and accountability.  #8220;There have been double-digit declines in the shares who say police forces do an excellent or good job of using the right amount of force for each situation (from 45% in 2016 to 35% today), treating racial and ethnic groups equally (47% to 34%) and holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs (44% to 31%). #8221; On the topic of defunding the police, the president #8217;s position gets wide support.  #8220;Just 25% of Americans say spending on policing in their area should be decreased, with only 12% saying it should be decreased a lot; another 14% say it should be reduced a little. #8221; (However, a Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday shows 77 percent think that  #8220;defund the police" refers to a change in how police do their job, while only 18 percent think it means to eliminate the police.) As President Trump threatens to unleash the military on American cities roiled in civil unrest, it's clear that he's embracing his inner Nixon. (Joshua Carroll, Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post) The Pew poll is consistent with other surveys showing that most Americans think Black Lives Matter brought attention to real issues (71 percent in Monmouth #8217;s poll) and that Trump #8217;s handling of the protests made things worse (62 percent in Monmouth). It should not be surprising that a president who thinks veneration of the Confederacy has widespread appeal would think George Wallace-like condemnation of civil rights protesters would have wide backing. Trump might be stuck in the 1950s, but most of America is not. While there is some erosion in concern about race from Republicans (the percentage saying underlying anger of these protesters is fully justified has fallen from 40 percent to 18 percent), after weeks of Trump #8217;s racist rhetoric and vilification of protesters seeking racial justice, those who seek to demonize protesters and defend the police at all costs are on the wrong side of public opinion. That does not mean Trump, who appears to have gone all-in on racist appeals, will shift course; it does, however, show that Republicans are foolish to follow him."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "What do a gripping family tell-all book and a momentous Supreme Court decision have in common? Quite a lot, it turns out. The book, to be published next week, comes from Mary L. Trump, a clinical psychologist who happens also to be niece of Donald Trump, the president of the United States. It describes how Donald Trump has been protected by institutions his entire life. Trump v. Vance, the Supreme Court case decided Thursday, illustrates how the president has pushed those protections to the limit  #8212; and how they #8217;re about to end. Mary Trump #8217;s  #8221;Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World #8217;s Most Dangerous Man #8221; tells a remarkable story, the broad strokes of which many already knew. Mary Trump offers a tale of what she calls  #8220;malignant #8221; family dysfunction, and how it produced a malignantly dysfunctional president. It #8217;s an unsparing and relentlessly detailed account. Her professional judgments about the president #8217;s indisputable narcissism and, perhaps, sociopathy dovetail with those that other experts have reached before. Yet it #8217;s not the possible diagnoses that give Mary Trump #8217;s book its punch. It #8217;s the factual detail  #8212; detail that only a family member could provide. According to the book, Donald Trump paid someone to take the SAT for him. He also tried to trick his mentally declining father into signing a codicil that would have stripped his siblings of their inheritances. Her specifics all lead to the same brutal conclusions:  #8220;the sum total of who my uncle is, #8221; she says, consists of  #8220;lies, misrepresentations, and fabrications. #8221; He #8217;s  #8220;incapable of growing, learning, or evolving. #8221; He lacks true competence, his  #8220;real skills #8221; being  #8220;self-aggrandizement, lying, and sleight of hand. #8221; His own sister, a former federal appellate judge, thinks of her brother as a  #8220;clown, #8221; unsuited for office. (Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called  #8221;Too Much and Never Enough #8221;  #8220;a book of falsehoods. #8221;) Above all, Mary Trump #8217;s point is that her uncle has spent his life being protected from the consequences of his actions and shortcomings. It #8217;s as though  #8220;Donald has been institutionalized for most of his adult life, #8221; she writes,  #8220;so there is no way to know how he would thrive, or even survive, on his own in the real world. #8221; Far from being the virtually self-made man he has always pretended to be, Donald Trump was the  #8220;vanity project #8221; of his father, whose money he used  #8220;to prop up an illusion #8221; of success. When sales of assets of his father #8217;s estate weren #8217;t enough to clean up his finances, a television producer, through artful editing and image-making,  #8220;presented him as a legitimately successful tycoon #8221;  #8212; something he never managed to be. And, as Mary Trump notes, her uncle has sought the ultimate institutional protection by invoking the presidency to serve his ends. For Donald Trump, the office has served as a bully pulpit from which he could lie and self-promote, with aides to solve, deflect or cover up his self-inflicted problems. In Vance, Trump tried to leverage the presidency for his personal benefit to an unprecedented extreme: His lawyers argued that the presidency should protect not just him from the legal consequences of his conduct  #8212; but his businesses, too. The case, ironically, came about partly because of Mary Trump. As her book explains, she became a principal confidential source for a New York Times expos #233; that described how the Trump Organization, over many years, may have dodged taxes. Those allegations became part of the predicate for a New York state criminal investigation that the president sued to curtail. Trump argued that, because he #8217;s president, not even his accountants had to respond to the district attorney #8217;s subpoena. The Supreme Court would have none of it. Its decision rejected Trump #8217;s narcissistic vision of the presidency.  #8220;In our judicial system, #8221; Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court,  #8220;the public has a right to every man #8217;s evidence. #8221; And that includes a president #8217;s evidence. Just as other presidents have  #8220;uniformly #8221; given evidence when required of them, the court held, so, too will Donald Trump and his businesses and accountants. Indeed, the court confirmed,  #8220;state grand juries are free to investigate a sitting president with an eye toward charging him after the completion of his term. #8221; On these points, at least, the court was unanimous. As Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh #8217;s concurring opinion aptly put,  #8220;no one is above the law. #8221; Not even Donald Trump. For the country, by adhering to that principle, the court vindicated the rule of law. But for Donald Trump personally, his niece #8217;s book and the Supreme Court #8217;s decision may someday be remembered as the beginning of the end of his institutional protections. And not just in a legal sense. Much of the power of the presidency comes from the perception of it, and that perception is now waning as the president bleeds out in the polls. As that power ebbs, more Mary Trumps and John Boltons will tell their stories, or give their evidence to investigators, with ever less fear. As Mary Trump puts it in her book,  #8220;the walls #8221; of her uncle #8217;s  #8220;very expensive and well-guarded padded cell are starting to disintegrate. #8221; Come January, they should be gone for good."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "WASHINGTON  #8212; At his campaign rally last month in Tulsa, Okla., President Trump ranked his Supreme Court appointments among his biggest achievements.  #8220;Two great Supreme Court judges! #8221; he boasted.  #8220;So, we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they #8217;re great. They are  #8212; they #8217;re great. #8221; He might not have felt so warmly on Thursday after Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh categorically dismissed his claim to  #8220;absolute immunity #8221; from investigators seeking his tax returns. In a pair of far-reaching rulings, Mr. Trump #8217;s two appointees joined a unanimous conclusion that the president went too far by pronouncing himself exempt from legal scrutiny. The forceful decisions represented a declaration of independence not only by Mr. Trump #8217;s own justices but by the Supreme Court as an institution, asserting itself as an equal branch of government in the Trump era. No matter how often Mr. Trump insists that he has complete authority in this instance or that, the justices made clear on Thursday that there were in fact limits, just as they did in landmark executive power cases involving Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. That a conservative court including two of his own appointees would so decisively slap down a Republican president #8217;s expansive claim of constitutional power served as a reminder that institutional prerogatives still matter in Washington, even in a time of extreme partisanship. The court remains broadly conservative on important issues like religious freedom, but in cases on gay rights, immigration, abortion and now executive power, it has defied the president repeatedly in recent weeks. By forging a unanimous consensus on Mr. Trump #8217;s immunity claim, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. seemed to underline the point he made two years ago when he rebuked Mr. Trump by saying there were no  #8220;Obama judges or Trump judges. #8221; Even on the overall votes on the two cases, both decided 7 to 2, he brought together four liberals and three conservatives, echoing the firm lines drawn by the court against other overreaching presidents.  #8220;The truth is, President Trump #8217;s arguments for immunity were so sweeping that it was almost impossible for any justice to really embrace them, #8221; said Tom Goldstein, a prominent Supreme Court litigator and the publisher of Scotusblog, a website that tracks the court. Still, the justices cut Mr. Trump a break by sending the two cases back to lower courts to consider the merits of the subpoenas according to standards set by the court, additional litigation that will most likely keep his tax returns shielded from public view through the general election on Nov. 3. Many legal experts predicted that Mr. Trump ultimately could still stave off congressional demands for his returns because the justices in Trump v. Mazars USA seemed dubious about their legitimacy and put the onus on the House to justify its need for the documents. But experts said Mr. Trump was likely to eventually lose the effort to block a New York prosecutor because the justices in Trump v. Vance put the burden on the president to come up with a compelling rationale for why the returns should not be turned over. The president lashed out on Twitter minutes after the court #8217;s rulings, once again presenting himself as a victim.  #8220;This is all a political prosecution, #8221; Mr. Trump wrote.  #8220;I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration! #8221;  #8220;Courts in the past have given  #8216;broad deference, #8217; #8221; he added.  #8220;BUT NOT ME! #8221; In fact, Mr. Trump was the one seeking special treatment. Every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns, but Mr. Trump has refused since 2015 when he began running for the White House and said he was being audited. While he promised to make them public once the audit was over, he never has. Five years later, the White House said on Thursday that he was still being audited but did not identify which years of tax returns were being reviewed. Once in office, every sitting president #8217;s returns are audited automatically, so if that remains his standard, he presumably will never release them voluntarily. Similarly, Mr. Trump was seeking court protection beyond that enjoyed by any other president, claiming  #8220;absolute immunity. #8221; That flew in the face of the principles set by the court when Mr. Nixon in 1974 lost his bid to shield tape recordings that implicated him in the Watergate cover-up. In that case, U.S. v. Nixon, the court ruled against the president 8 to 0, including three of his appointees, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Lewis F. Powell Jr. A fourth appointee, Justice William H. Rehnquist, recused himself because he had served in Mr. Nixon #8217;s Justice Department. Twenty-three years later, the court rebuffed Mr. Clinton #8217;s immunity claim while in office against a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state worker. Both of Mr. Clinton #8217;s appointees, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, rejected his position in the 9-to-0 decision in that case, Clinton v. Jones. Like his predecessors, Mr. Trump was unhappy with the rulings, although aides sought to calm him by assuring him that he could continue fighting in lower courts. But he expressed deep anger at Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, seeing their votes as a betrayal, according to a person familiar with his reaction. But the two justices only followed in the footsteps of their predecessors by rejecting the president who put them on the court. While each of them has generally sided with Mr. Trump since taking office, in this case they drew a line. Neither is personally close to Mr. Trump nor is either thought to be much of an admirer of the president, so some saw the decision as a way to distance themselves."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (shortened for length) "President Trump won the White House in no small part by seizing on Hillary Clinton #8217;s missteps and using them to turn many voters against her. But after three unsteady months, and with the Republican convention six weeks away, Mr. Trump is struggling to define Joseph R. Biden Jr. to similarly devastating effect, a critical task at this stage of a presidential race. By a combination of design and circumstance, Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has managed so far to deny Mr. Trump the sort of damaging offhand remarks, campaign clashes and clumsy encounters with voters that he used as weapons against Mrs. Clinton in the last general election, as well as his Republican opponents in the 2016 primary. This is partly because Mr. Biden has run such a low-profile campaign during the pandemic. He has had few public appearances and news conferences, which can provide the unscripted moments opponents can use to shape the public #8217;s perception of a candidate. But there are other obstacles for Mr. Trump that have become clear since Mr. Biden effectively won his party #8217;s nomination in April. Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is viewed more favorably by voters than Mrs. Clinton was in 2016. He is a moderate Democrat who lacks a history of harsh partisanship or scandal. And he has long appealed to white working-class voters, who are part of Mr. Trump #8217;s base.  #8220;It is going to be more difficult for the Trump campaign to go after a man who really is a centrist, has dealings with people across the aisle and knows how to talk to people who disagree with him, #8221; said Priscilla Southwell, a professor emerita of political science at the University of Oregon.  #8220;And 2020 is a different kind of year. Donald Trump can appeal to his core by being negative, but it #8217;s such a difficult time for everybody. I don #8217;t think negativity is going to sell as well as it used to. #8221; Defining an opponent  #8212; putting them on the defensive with caricature  #8212; is a crucial and proven tactic for candidates in competitive races. There is a graveyard of failed contenders  #8212; names like Kennedy, McGovern, Romney, Gore and Hillary Clinton  #8212; who found themselves branded by an opponent in portrayals, often unfair, that ricocheted across the political playing field and the media. Mr. Trump had been adept at this. But the kind of attacks that seemed so effective when he was a new-to-politics outsider in 2016 also appear to have less resonance coming from inside the White House. Four years of tweets by Mr. Trump have numbed many voters.  #8220;It #8217;s almost self-defeating, #8221; said Ron Christie, a Republican who was a senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.  #8220;People are exhausted. The president, with every tweet, every insult, will move himself out of favor with the demographic that he needs the most, which is the independent. #8221; Mr. Trump does have some avenues to use against Mr. Biden before voter attitudes begin to harden. He has sought to tie Mr. Biden to the political unrest that has swept the country since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 by the police. And Mr. Trump has tried to portray his opponent as senile,  #8220;sleepy, #8221; corrupt and an ally of China, but none of those lines of attack has resonated with the public, at least up to now. His aides have signaled that Mr. Trump, incumbent or not, would run as an outsider against Mr. Biden  #8212; who has been a fixture in Washington since he was elected to the Senate in 1972  #8212; the way he had against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Biden #8217;s long history of votes in the Senate, as well as his eight years as an active vice president under President Barack Obama, could give Mr. Trump plenty of material. And if Mr. Biden continues to escape definition, Mr. Trump is likely to turn to Mr. Biden #8217;s running mate. Going after the vice-presidential candidate would be an unusual but not unprecedented strategy, and might have some resonance in this election given Mr. Biden #8217;s age; he is 77. (Mr. Trump is 74.) Mr. Trump #8217;s campaign had calculated that Mr. Biden, given his long history and the stumbles in the early days of his primary, would be an easier opponent to caricature. But now, as Mr. Trump prepares to go to New Hampshire on Saturday for his latest campaign rally, time is running short. A series of national polls has shown Mr. Trump trailing Mr. Biden, often by double digits. Even more alarming for the president, he is trailing Mr. Biden in battleground states that he won in 2016 and are likely critical to any re-election plan  #8212; including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Even states like Georgia, which once seemed clearly in Mr. Trump #8217;s column, now appear competitive.  #8220;Trump has much less time to pile up negatives on Biden, #8221; said Nelson Warfield, a Republican consultant who served as press secretary for Bob Dole #8217;s presidential campaign in 1996.  #8220;I made my first negative ad starring Hillary Clinton in 1992 and I kept doing ads criticizing her across the next 24 years. And I was by no means alone. Republicans have months to do to Biden what Republicans had over two decades to do to Hillary. #8221; ImageMr. Trump gave a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore on July 3, where he refrained from mentioning Mr. Biden, whom he has struggled to attack. Mr. Trump gave a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore on July 3, where he refrained from mentioning Mr. Biden, whom he has struggled to attack.Credit...Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Mr. Trump would certainly seem to have a few advantages here to make his case. He has the platform of the White House and his Twitter account. Until two months ago, he enjoyed a huge financial advantage over Mr. Biden. And Mr. Trump, unlike Mr. Biden, never had to worry this year about a primary or uniting his party behind him. But to the frustration of Republicans, his attempts to define Mr. Biden have seemed fitful. He barely mentioned Mr. Biden during two of his campaign #8217;s highest-profile moments in months: his speech in front of Mount Rushmore last week, followed by his July 4 address from the White House South Lawn. And when Mr. Biden has made mistakes, Mr. Trump #8217;s campaign has struggled to turn them to its advantage. When Mr. Biden said that any African-American voter who considered supporting Mr. Trump  #8220;ain #8217;t Black, #8221; the Trump campaign roared into action, but the fallout lasted only a day, particularly after Mr. Biden apologized."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The founding falsehood that set the tone for the most mendacious presidency in U.S. history  #8212; the original Big Lie  #8212; was all about crowd size. In January 2017, President Trump and his spokesperson inflated his inaugural audience with a series of grotesque falsehoods. Trump even attacked the media for telling the truth about his paltry inaugural turnout. So it #8217;s fitting that as Trump #8217;s first term  #8212; and perhaps his presidency  #8212; winds down, he is confronting the very same fear that produced that original series of foundational lies: The fear that the crowds just aren #8217;t showing up the way they #8217;re supposed to. Two new reports  #8212; one from NBC News, and one from the Associated Press  #8212; shed light on an internal debate now underway among Trump advisers about how to manage both this new reality and Trump #8217;s own emotional struggle with it. The picture that emerges is one in which they are working to balance Trump #8217;s insatiable need to feed off adoring crowds against the reality that people might be disinclined to brave the plague conditions that he did so much to unleash on the country. The imperatives of satiating Trump #8217;s megalomania are bumping up against the consequences of his depravity and incompetence. Trump is set to hold a weekend rally in New Hampshire, and as NBC reports, his advisers are desperate to avoid a repeat of the lackluster turnout at his Oklahoma gathering. As one puts it:  #8220;We can #8217;t have a repeat of Tulsa. #8221; What #8217;s changed is that Trump now realizes why the Tulsa fiasco happened: A White House official tells NBC that Trump  #8220;sees now #8221; that supporters may not turn out at rallies due to coronavirus fears. It #8217;s galling that Trump only sees this now, since experts loudly warned against rallies, and one of his paramount goals was to create the illusion of normalcy, so everyone would get back to work and the economy would roar back to greatness on Trump #8217;s re-election schedule. So the new rally will be outdoors, and masks will be strongly encouraged, though not mandated. Meanwhile, Trump continues urging a recklessly rapid reopening while refusing to set a mask-wearing example himself. Yet Trump #8217;s advisers also know that future rallies create the risk of more lackluster appearances. But they #8217;re going to brave that risk, and the Associated Press reports on why: Despite the risks, the Trump campaign believes it needs to return to the road, both to animate the president, who draws energy from his crowds, and to inject life into a campaign that is facing a strong challenge from Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The problem is that at a time when coronavirus cases are spiking to record levels in many states and nationally, Trump nonetheless wants and needs big crowds. Trump himself unwittingly laid bare the dynamic in an interview with Sean Hannity on Thursday night.  #8220;We #8217;re doing very well in the polls, #8221; Trump declared, when in fact his approval numbers are 15 points underwater and he #8217;s trailing Biden nationally by 10 points. Both metrics have gotten worse over the last few weeks, but Trump insisted:  #8220;We #8217;re rapidly rising. #8221;  #8220;There #8217;s great spirit, #8221; Trump continued.  #8220;Spirit like nobody #8217;s ever seen before, actually. And there #8217;s no spirit for Joe. #8221; As the constant lying about polls demonstrates, for Trump the impression that he #8217;s losing  #8212; that his energy and candidacy are flagging, that the crowds aren #8217;t showing up  #8212; is itself deadly. What must be relentlessly manufactured is the illusion that he remains enormously popular and that Trump #8217;s America is energized and primed and ready to win again. Trump has obsessed over his crowd sizes throughout his presidency. Indeed, the ability to create imagery like this is why he held rallies in off-years like 2019 in the first place: [Trump tweet of crowd  #8220;Look at the tremendous overflow at packed arena in New Hampshire last night. Sorry we couldn #8217;t get you in, will be back soon! #8221; This obsession goes back many years. In his biography of Trump, journalist Timothy O #8217;Brien recounts an exchange between Trump and producer Lorne Michaels, in which Trump acknowledges his NBC project might not attract a big audience forever:  #8220;You know, Lorne, it won #8217;t always be this way, #8221; Donald mused.  #8220;Someday NBC will call me and say,  #8216;Donald, the ratings are no good and we are going to have to cancel. #8217; #8221;  #8220;No, Donald, there is only one difference, #8221; Michaels replied.  #8220;They won #8217;t even call. #8221; That exchange remained with Trump for years, O #8217;Brien reports.  #8220;Trump's biggest existential fear is that the spotlight will be turned off, the seats will be empty, and his phone will stop ringing, #8221; O #8217;Brien told me.  #8220;If the ratings drop, he drops. #8221;  #8220;There isn #8217;t any part of his life that hasn #8217;t been touched by this, #8221; O #8217;Brien continued.  #8220;His obsession with newspaper and TV coverage in the  #8217;70s,  #8217;80s and  #8217;90s; how many people show up at his rallies; how he #8217;s performing in the polls. It #8217;s always there." Trump has never had majority support An enduring fact about the Trump presidency is that he has never once had a majority of this country behind him. He lost the popular vote in 2016 and his approval has never cracked 50 percent. Trump sometimes deals with this by declaring himself enormously popular  #8212; among carefully tailored groups. He says he won a majority of women; he won only a majority of white women. He constantly claims unspecified polls show he has 96 percent approval  #8212; among Republicans. At other times he simply invents a  #8220;SILENT MAJORITY #8221; that remains behind him. At still others, he uses absurdly tortured imagery to portray that silent majority: [Trump tweet of US map with red counties vs. blue counties] Now Trump is facing the prospect of losing even his ability to create and experience the illusion that an enormous portion of the country remains enthusiastically behind him. And it #8217;s all because he can #8217;t conjure up the power to seduce people into believing the lethal virus he has done so little to curb doesn #8217;t really exist. It must be a special kind of hell for him."\</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump has been dangerously wrong with almost every step in addressing the coronavirus pandemic. He was wrong that it would go from  #8220;15 cases #8221; to none. He was wrong that it would disappear in warm weather. He was wrong to prod states to reopen before the pandemic was stamped out and before a robust testing and tracing program was in place. And he is really wrong that we should reopen schools even if they do not meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. On Thursday, Trump suffered another blow when the most respected voice on the subject bashed Florida for its premature opening. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reports: Florida on Thursday crossed the 4,000-death threshold for the pandemic and logged the most deaths in a 24-hour period: 120. The state also drew the criticism of the nation #8217;s top infectious disease expert. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called out Florida for bypassing guidelines and opening too soon.  #8220;Certainly Florida, #8221; he said, in an interview with the FiveThirtyEight podcast on Thursday,  #8220;jumped over a couple of checkpoints. #8221; What #8217;s more, because Florida officials opened unwisely and unleashed the virus, it may now be necessary for them to close down the economy again.  #8220;I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down, #8221; Fauci told the Wall Street Journal. If that happens, Trump #8217;s goal of revving up the economy quickly will be obliterated. (Remember when Jared Kushner insisted we would be  #8220;rocking #8221; by July? Instead, we are reeling.) Even the CDC does not seem keen on fudging the science to meet Trump #8217;s reelection timetable.  #8220;Our guidelines are our guidelines, but we are going to provide additional reference documents to aid basically communities in trying to open K-through-12s, #8221; said Robert Redfield, the CDC director.  #8220;It #8217;s not a revision of the guidelines; it #8217;s just to provide additional information to help schools be able to use the guidance we put forward. #8221; Will parents, mayors and governors continue to listen to Trump, whose advice sent them hurtling back into pandemic hell and struggling to prevent hospitals from being overrun, or the medical experts who have been warning all along what steps are needed, what a premature reopening would entail and what testing and tracing had to be in place before ending stay-at-home orders? Trump #8217;s threat to withhold funds is an idle one. Congress has appropriated money for the Education Department, a record amount by the way, for the balance of the fiscal year (ending Sept. 30). Unless the Republican-controlled Senate or Trump wants to run on shutting down schools (unlikely, even for a politician as self-destructive as Trump), money will in all likelihood be there through the end of Trump #8217;s term. In other words, Trump makes a threat he cannot carry out, the only result of which is to remind parents, teachers and everyone else of his dangerous contempt for experts and disregard of the health of Americans, including children. Given that more than 56 million children attend public schools and 7.6 million people work in public schools (there is some overlap between the two)  #8212; with both groups represented in every state  #8212; it is hard to imagine a more effective way of scaring off voters. Sure, Trump wants to get the economy back up and running, which will require children to go back to school (or have other child-care arrangements) but he makes exactly the same error as he did when demanding businesses reopen: You have to stamp out the virus and have a rigorous testing and tracing program in place before you start reopening. If not, you wind up with the worst of both worlds  #8212; soaring numbers of cases and a shuttered economy  #8212; which is precisely where Trump has put us."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Text (shortened) "United Airlines announced plans to lay off more than one-third of its 95,000 workers. Brooks Brothers, which first opened for business in 1818, filed for bankruptcy. And Bed Bath and Beyond said it will close 200 stores. Welcome to the recovery. If there were still hopes of a  #8220;V-shaped #8221; comeback from the novel coronavirus shutdown, this past week should have put an end to them. The pandemic shock, which economists once assumed would be only a temporary business interruption, appears instead to be settling into a traditional, self-perpetuating recession. When states and cities began closing most businesses in March, the idea was to smother the virus and buy time for the medical system to adapt. Jared Kushner, the president #8217;s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, spoke of hopes  #8220;that by July the country #8217;s really rocking again. #8221; But without a uniform federal strategy, many governors rushed to reopen their economies before bringing the virus under control. Now states such as Florida, California, Texas and Arizona are setting daily records for coronavirus cases and more than 70 percent of the country has either paused or reversed reopening plans, according to Goldman Sachs. After two surprisingly strong months, the economy could begin shedding jobs again this month and in August, Morgan Stanley warned Friday. Many small businesses that received forgivable government loans have exhausted their funds while some larger companies are starting to thin their payrolls in preparation for a longer-than-expected downturn. Fresh labor market weakness would represent a profound disappointment for millions of American workers and President Trump, who is eager to highlight economic progress with only a few months remaining before the November election.  #8220;  #8216;Stalling #8217; is the word I #8217;m using, #8221; said Jim O #8217;Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Ameritrade.  #8220;But the risk there is that the numbers start turning negative again. #8221; Reopening efforts stall in Houston as covid-19 cases spike Several regional Federal Reserve officials last week expressed concerns about the recovery petering out. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, warned that economic activity  #8220;is starting to level off. #8221; Thomas Barkin, who heads the Richmond Fed, cited  #8220;air pockets #8221; in new business orders. At the White House on Friday, however, the president insisted that his plans were on track.  #8220;I created the greatest economy we #8217;ve ever had. And now we #8217;re creating it again, #8221; he said before leaving for Florida. A day earlier, he told a group of Hispanic leaders he had launched  #8220;the fastest economic comeback in history. #8221; The economy did regain a total of 7.5 million jobs in May and June, faster than many economists anticipated. But that was just one-third of the number lost to the pandemic. In a worrisome sign, more than two months after states like Georgia lifted their shelter-in-place orders, layoffs are spreading beyond companies that provide services requiring direct human contact. As disruption from the pandemic lingers, this could mean that the job loss is starting to feed on itself in a classic recessionary spiral, economists said. Harley-Davidson last week said it was eliminating 700 jobs as part of a restructuring plan it described as unrelated to fallout from the pandemic. In April, the company said:  #8220;The crisis has provided an opportunity to reevaluate every aspect of our business and strategic plan. We have determined that we need to make significant changes to the company." Indeed, the pandemic, which marked an abrupt end to a nearly 11-year expansion, is prompting companies to rethink their operations and to trim fat that accumulated while the economy was growing. Wells Fargo, the nation #8217;s fourth-largest bank, is drawing up plans to cut  #8220;tens of thousands #8221; of jobs later this year, according to a Bloomberg News report.  #8220;While the timing seems to coincide with the stalling of the economic reopening process in over 30 states, there may well be something more strategic in play  #8212; that is, pressure on a growing segment of corporate America to  #8216;right size #8217; for what increasingly looks like a longer road back to full economic recovery, #8221; said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, via email. The unemployment rate never reached the Depression-caliber level of 20 percent that many economists had feared in March, topping out so far at 14.7 percent. But layoffs that initially were described as a temporary response to a health crisis are hardening into something more permanent, leaving millions of workers scrambling to regain their footing in a changed economy. The labor market remains a ruin. First-time claims for unemployment benefits have exceeded the previously unheard of figure of 1 million for 16 consecutive weeks. Including a new program for freelancers and gig economy workers affected by the pandemic, weekly claims are rising. Almost 33 million Americans now are collecting some form of unemployment benefits, according to Morgan Stanley. Even allowing for some double-counting in the figures, that means nearly 20 percent of those who were working in February are now jobless, according to economist Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives. It is no longer a question of returning to the pre-pandemic environment that existed as recently as four months ago, economists said. Under the remorseless influence of the pandemic, the U.S. economy is being reshaped. There will be fewer jobs in airlines, hotels, restaurants and traditional retail and more in e-commerce and technology industries. Shifting workers from fading industries to the handful that are experiencing rising sales will not happen quickly. During the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, it took nearly 10 years for the unemployment rate to fall back to its 4.4 percent low. For Levi Strauss, booming online sales were not enough to offset the impact of the closure of most of its retail outlets in March and April. The company said last week it would lay off 700 workers, aiming to trim quarterly expenses by $100 million.  #8220;I don #8217;t think any of us think we #8217;ll get the economy back to 100 percent before there #8217;s a medical answer, #8221; said James Glassman, JPMorgan Chase #8217;s head economist for commercial banking.  #8220;The longer it goes on, the more damage it does."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length) "Someone in the administration must have thought it was a good idea to send Education Secretary Betsy DeVos out on the Sunday shows to defend President Trump #8217;s directive that schools should reopen in the fall regardless of health conditions. He declared last week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention #8217;s guidelines were too much of a bother and that he #8217;d cut off funding to the schools if they did not reopen. It was a mistake both because Trump #8217;s impulsive, irrational and illegal assertions are not grounded in reality and because DeVos is singularly incapable of appearing thoughtful and reasonable. How #8217;s Trump going to cut off money to schools? She floundered in response to questions from Chris Wallace on  #8220;Fox News Sunday #8221;: WALLACE: And President Trump tweeted Friday: Schools must be open in the fall. If not open, why would the federal government give funding? It won't. Two quick questions and I need a quick answer if I can from you, Secretary DeVos. One, under what authority are you and the president going to unilaterally cut off funding, funding that's been approved from Congress and most of the money goes to disadvantaged students or students with disabilities? And secondly, isn't cutting off funding exactly the wrong answer? Don't you want to spend more money to make schools safer, whether it's with plastic shields or health checks, various other systems? Does it make more sense to increase funding for schools where it's unsafe rather than cut off funding? DEVOS: Look, American investment in education is a promise to students and their families. If schools aren't going to reopen and not fulfill that promise, they shouldn't get the funds, and give it to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: Well, you can't do that. DEVOS: It #8217;s promise to the American people. That #8217;s  #8212; (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: I know you support vouchers and that #8217;s  #8212; I know you support vouchers, and that #8217;s a  #8212; that #8217;s a reasonable argument. But you can #8217;t do that unilaterally, you have to do that through Congress. DEVOS: Well, we #8217;re looking at all the options because it #8217;s a promise to the American people, to students and their families, and we want to make sure that promise is followed through on. Trump has no such authority so her insistence on talking in circles simply highlighted how empty is his threat and how lacking in expertise and integrity she is. WALLACE: But, Secretary, I want to get  #8212; I want to get to this issue of  #8212; because the president of the United States said that the CDC guidelines were tough, expensive and impractical. I want to look at some of the other CDC guidance. They talked about putting up shielding in places where six foot  #8212; six feet of distance is not possible, plastic shielding. They talked about staggered drop-offs and pickups. Is that tough, expensive and impractical? DEVOS: Well, again, all of the guidelines are meant to be helpful, to help local education leaders decide and work on how they are going to accomplish what they need to do, and that is getting kids back in school based on their situation and their realities. We know that schools across the country look very different and that there #8217;s not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to everything. But the key is, there has to be a posture of doing something, of action, of getting things going, putting a plan together for your specific school, for your specific district or for your classroom that ensures that kids are going to start learning again this fall. She never explained what the problem was, but neither did she have a plan of her own. CNN #8217;s Dana Bash made that plain on  #8220;State of the Union #8221;: BASH: I #8217;m a parent. I want my school-aged child to go back to school as much as you are saying you want for everybody. But the question is, can it happen safely? So, can you  #8212; by saying what you just said, also assure parents, students, children, everybody who #8217;s there, that they #8217;re going to be able to do so safely? DEVOS: Well, we know that children get the virus at a far lower rate than any other part of the population. And, again, there #8217;s  #8212; there is no  #8212; nothing in the data that would suggest that kids being back in school is  #8212; is dangerous to them. And, in fact, it #8217;s  #8212; it #8217;s more a matter of their health and well-being that they be back in school. And we have seen this in countries, other countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world, where students have gone back to school and have done so very successfully. That should be the goal. BASH: Well, we do know that children can spread the virus.  #8230; And here #8217;s what the CDC guidelines say:  #8220;If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk. Children can pass this virus onto others who have an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. #8221; That #8217;s your own federal government #8217;s guidelines.  #8230; And it sounds like what you #8217;re saying is you, as the secretary of education, is compelling  #8212; you are compelling schools to reopen regardless of what #8217;s happening. DEVOS: No, what we're saying is that kids need to be back in school, and that school leaders across the country need to be making plans to do just that. There's going to be the exception to the rule, but the rule should be that kids go back to school this fall. And where there are little flare-ups or hot spots, that can be dealt with on a school-by-school or a case-by-case basis. DeVos had her talking points defending the president but not an actual plan for addressing the complex and crucial issue of reopening schools. When a narcissist is president, the interests of the American people  #8212; even of vulnerable children  #8212; pale in comparison to the need to soothe and stroke the ego of the president."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The country has experienced over 135,000 deaths. Poll after poll shows voters worry about re-opening businesses, schools and other venues too soon more than they worry about the economic consequences from delayed reopening. One Sunbelt state after another reports record number of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The incumbent turns to advisers who recommend: Attack the most respected voice on coronavirus in the country, the world renown expert in infectious diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci (although his predictions were thoroughly borne out while Trump #8217;s contradictions were dangerously wrong) - Tell parents they must put their students back in school regardless of the circumstances - Refuse to wear a mask for months, then receive condescending pats on the head for finally wearing on - Insist everything is getting better - Move your presidential nominating convention from a responsible state making headway on the pandemic to a state with a runaway outbreak, largely resulting from a Trump-sycophantic governor #8217;s refusal to follow medical experts #8217; advice on safe re-opening practices Upon getting such advice any presidential candidate in his or her right mind would reject the advice and fire the advisers. In the case of President Trump however these are all strategies he either initiated or whole-heartedly endorsed. Because the strategy is so patently self-destructive it has launched a cottage industry of Trump whisperers trying to determine: Does he really think this will work or can he just not help himself? Whichever is the case - and it hardly matters which - it is a recipe for electoral disaster for him and his party. That in turn raises the question: Doesn #8217;t the rest of the party know this is nuts, and if so why do candidates on the ballot go along? The explanation for why lemmings go over the cliff is complicated. Peer pressure and a conservative reward system that swiftly punishes dissenters and rewards boot-licking (see Sen. Lindsey Graham) provide part of the reason fro Republicans #8217; refusal to break free. In addition, many are under the impression that if they just hide, occupying a space with a fleet of fellow-Republican cowards, they will go undetected. They bet that voters do not expect much of them, and on this they may be right. Finally, some Republicans - not only ones in gerrymandered districts or red states but those in competitive districts - figure that if they break ranks they #8217;ll wind up in political no-man #8217;s land. Progressives will not embrace them, and the Trump cult will abandon (or savage) them. Let #8217;s also not underestimate the role of careerism and greed. Some Republicans figure Trump will lose and they might too. However, Fox News (disclaimer: I am an MSNBC contributor), talk radio, rightwing think tanks, rightwing publishing labels, conservative issue-advocacy groups and pro-Trump websites will endure. The rightwing racket will be there after the 2020 election, and may be for those who lose their races the only hope for gainful employment and continued relevance. There is a group however that may actually change behavior after viewing the remarkable dumb Trump tactics: Donors. True, many of them are extreme ideological cheerleaders for the president who will keep shoveling money his way (proving once more that wealth and intelligence are often unrelated). Many are however are transactional donors. The wealthy businessman or the philanthropic doyen who gave to Trump in the past could well decide that they should stop funding this politically suicide campaign and those senators in swing states too timid to back away from the dumpster fire. They can spend their money on state races or non-political causes or themselves. As irrational as Trump, his campaign yes-men and his timorous congressional allies may be, I suspect a significant number of donors will have no trouble telling Trump and his enablers to buzz off next time they come asking for money."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "I wholeheartedly agree with my friend and fellow Never Trumper Bill Kristol when he says the fate of the Republican Party is up in the air. He rightly reminds us that some intellectual humility is in order. As he puts it:  #8220;Lost cause or worth trying to save? I don #8217;t know. #8221; There are actually two questions here. The first: What will happen to the Republican Party? For starters, this assumes that the Republicans are heading for a big loss (as is increasingly wise). If they do not lose, the Republican Party remains the party of authoritarian, right-wing nationalism, and the country is in deep trouble. But if President Trump does lose, what happens to the party depends on a myriad of factors  #8212; the size of the loss, the fate of the Senate majority, the degree to which the party splits with Trump during the final stretch, the attitude of donors who will have wasted collectively hundreds of millions of dollars and  #8212; yes  #8212; how Democrats govern going forward. It is going to be a long time before that all works itself out. The second question is normative: What should happen to the Republican Party? As a proud co-founder of the  #8220;they deserve to go out of business #8221; faction, I maintain that Republicans #8217; collective failure to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic, to stand up to a dangerously defective president and to adhere to some semblance of objective truth renders this crop of Republicans undeserving of the public #8217;s trust. Since a party is the sum-total of its elected officials and supporters, Republicans, from my perspective, should be disqualified from holding office until there is a new generation of Republicans untainted by support for Trump and willing to repudiate Trumpism. I confess to having no specific loyalty to a shell of a party; it is the ideas it propounds and the leaders it offers that determine whether it deserves support. The question then becomes: What kind of party does the country need if the current Republican Party is relegated to the dustbin of history? We need a functional two-party system in which each party offers alternative policy ideas and restrains the other. However, if the Trump era taught us anything, it is that certain core values are required to participate in the political process (e.g., fidelity to the rule of law; devotion to separation of powers; recognition that the United States is defined not by race, gender or religion, but by our creed that  #8220;all men are created equal #8221;). To gain admission to the political playing field, a party must buy into the constitutional system and reflect basic human decency. Trumpism has proved utterly unwilling to do that, and its core philosophy  #8212; to the extent there is one  #8212; is a brand of populism that is antithetical to a pluralistic democracy. By the same token, the philosophy that ran its course in the GOP (e.g., tax cuts for the wealthy, antagonism toward government, aversion to racial fairness) does not provide a viable alternative to progressivism. There simply is not sufficient support for a party featuring unfettered faith in the free market or denial of systemic racism. It is not morally tenable to feature voter suppression and discouragement as a party strategy. Without Trumpism or dead-end conservatism, what is left? The task for former or disenchanted Republicans, I would suggest, is defining what political philosophy is appropriate to our times and distinct enough from progressivism to offer a choice. Whatever you call it  #8212; conservatism 2.0, moderation, pragmatism,  #8220;small-l #8221; liberalism  #8212; it must defend democratic institutions, address yawning gaps in wealth and opportunity, integrate into a global economy, tackle systemic problems such as climate change and racism, root out corruption and cronyism, and exercise leadership in a world in which illiberal regimes are increasingly aggressive and confident. There are numerous attempts to forge ideas and an overarching philosophy that might be competitive in the political arena. Out of that may a new party or ideological movement arise. In the meantime, the existing Republican Party should be defeated, and all Americans should encourage the Democratic Party to govern honorably and advance the best progressive ideas with an appreciation for unintended consequences and the value of free markets. A spirit of innovation and pragmatism, rather than dogma and one-size-fits-all solutions, would serve the country well. I suspect if Democrats do not fall prey to excess or corruption, they will be in power for a good, long while  #8212; until an alternative party offers something of value to Americans. Right now, the only thing Republicans offer is a brew of meanness, propaganda, science denial, corruption and racism."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "A comprehensive shutdown may be required in much of the country. By John M. Barry Mr. Barry is the author of  #8220;The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History. #8221; When you mix science and politics, you get politics. With the coronavirus, the United States has proved politics hasn #8217;t worked. If we are to fully reopen both the economy and schools safely  #8212; which can be done  #8212; we have to return to science. To understand just how bad things are in the United States and, more important, what can be done about it requires comparison. At this writing, Italy, once the poster child of coronavirus devastation and with a population twice that of Texas, has recently averaged about 200 new cases a day when Texas has had over 9,000. Germany, with a population four times that of Florida, has had fewer than 400 new cases a day. On Sunday, Florida reported over 15,300, the highest single-day total of any state. The White House says the country has to learn to live with the virus. That #8217;s one thing if new cases occurred at the rates in Italy or Germany, not to mention South Korea or Australia or Vietnam (which so far has zero deaths). It #8217;s another thing when the United States has the highest growth rate of new cases in the world, ahead even of Brazil. Italy, Germany and dozens of other countries have reopened almost entirely, and they had every reason to do so. They all took the virus seriously and acted decisively, and they continue to: Australia just issued fines totaling $18,000 because too many people attended a birthday party in someone #8217;s home. In the United States, public health experts were virtually unanimous that replicating European success required, first, maintaining the shutdown until we achieved a steep downward slope in cases; second, getting widespread compliance with public health advice; and third, creating a work force of at least 100,000  #8212; some experts felt 300,000 were needed  #8212; to test, trace and isolate cases. Nationally we came nowhere near any of those goals, although some states did and are now reopening carefully and safely. Other states fell far short but reopened anyway. We now see the results. While New York City just recorded its first day in months without a Covid-19 death, the pandemic is growing across 39 states. In Miami-Dade County in Florida, six hospitals have reached capacity. In Houston, where one of the country #8217;s worst outbreaks rages, officials have called on the governor to issue a stay-at-home order. As if explosive growth in too many states isn #8217;t bad enough, we are also suffering the same shortages that haunted hospitals in March and April. In New Orleans, testing supplies are so limited that one site started testing at 8 a.m. but had only enough to handle the people lined up by 7:33 a.m. And testing by itself does little without an infrastructure to not only trace and contact potentially infected people but also manage and support those who test positive and are isolated along with those urged to quarantine. Too often this has not been done; in Miami, only 17 percent of those testing positive for the coronavirus had completed questionnaires to help with contact tracing, critical to slowing spread. Many states now have so many cases that contact tracing has become impossible anyway. What #8217;s the answer? Social distancing, masks, hand washing and self-quarantine remain crucial. Too little emphasis has been placed on ventilation, which also matters. Ultraviolet lights can be installed in public areas. These things will reduce spread, and President Trump finally wore a mask publicly, which may somewhat depoliticize the issue. But at this point all these things together, even with widespread compliance, can only blunt dangerous trends where they are occurring. The virus is already too widely disseminated for these actions to quickly bend the curve downward. To reopen schools in the safest way, which may be impossible in some instances, and to get the economy fully back on track, we must get the case counts down to manageable levels  #8212; down to the levels of European countries. The Trump administration #8217;s threat to withhold federal funds from schools that don #8217;t reopen won #8217;t accomplish that goal. To do that, only decisive action will work in places experiencing explosive growth  #8212; at the very least, limits even on private gatherings and selective shutdowns that must include not just such obvious places as bars but churches, also a well-documented source of large-scale spread. Depending on local circumstances, that may prove insufficient; a comprehensive April-like shutdown may be required. This could be on a county-by-county basis, but half-measures will do little more than prevent hospitals from being overrun. Half-measures will leave transmission at a level vastly exceeding those of the many countries that have contained the virus. Half-measures will leave too many Americans not living with the virus but dying from it. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, almost every city closed down much of its activity. Fear and caring for sick family members did the rest; absenteeism even in war industries exceeded 50 percent and eviscerated the economy. Many cities reopened too soon and had to close a second time  #8212; sometimes a third time  #8212; and faced intense resistance. But lives were saved. Had we done it right the first time, we #8217;d be operating at near 100 percent now, schools would be preparing for a nearly normal school year, football teams would be preparing to practice  #8212; and tens of thousands of Americans would not have died. This is our second chance. We won #8217;t get a third. If we don #8217;t get the growth of this pandemic under control now, in a few months, when the weather turns cold and forces people to spend more time indoors, we could face a disaster that dwarfs the situation today."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It #8217;s laughable, really, that President Trump is presenting himself as the candidate of  #8220;law and order #8221; in the 2020 presidential campaign. His record in office has been one of illegality and disorder. Trump #8217;s presidency has been a sustained attack on our traditional conception of the rule of law in America. He has sought increasingly to govern by executive mandate  #8212; on immigration, foreign policy, health care, and environmental and economic policy. He defies Congress and the courts almost on a weekly basis. Trump #8217;s contempt for the law was obvious in his granting of clemency last week to his campaign crony Roger Stone. The best summary came from Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who just eight years ago was the presidential nominee of a Republican Party that hadn #8217;t surrendered its values:  #8220;Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president. #8221; As President Trump threatens to unleash the military on American cities roiled in civil unrest, it's clear that he's embracing his inner Nixon. (Joshua Carroll, Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post) And yet Trump postures as the tough guy who will protect the nation. Since the beginning of June, he has tweeted or retweeted the phrase  #8220;law and order #8221; 33 times, often just the three words, in capital letters, with an exclamation point. Democrats sometimes make it easy for him by pushing slogans such as  #8220;Defund the Police #8221; or  #8220;Abolish ICE #8221; that Trump then uses to play on public fears. Glenn Kessler, The Post #8217;s Fact Checker, noted Tuesday that the Trump campaign has spent $6.7 million to run an ad in 12 battleground states that claims:  #8220;Joe Biden #8217;s supporters are fighting to defund police departments. Violent crime has exploded. You won #8217;t be safe in Joe Biden #8217;s America. #8221; In awarding the ad four Pinocchios, Kessler noted that the former vice president had actually said in early June,  #8220;No, I don #8217;t support defunding the police. #8221; Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate, shouldn #8217;t cede this ground. He should make the case that real law and order are impossible without social justice. Conservatives shouldn #8217;t own this theme any more than they do the American flag. A lawful and orderly America is also one that advances racial and economic equality. Trump #8217;s populism involves a sleight of hand. He #8217;s the billionaire who claims he #8217;s standing up for the little guy, even as he advocates tax policies rewarding the rich. He claims to be the champion of the military and law enforcement, even as he undermines the independence of both. Trump is about raw power  #8212; the kind that comes from ignoring the rule of law. That #8217;s what he shares with strongman presidents such as China #8217;s Xi Jinping, Russia #8217;s Vladimir Putin and Turkey #8217;s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. None of them let rules or past practices get in the way of exercising their political will. When Erdogan declares that the Hagia Sophia won #8217;t be a museum anymore but a mosque, the rationale for this usurpation is simple: Because I can. Watching Trump and his fellow rule-breakers at work, we #8217;re reminded what a thin membrane the rule of law really is. Just on the other side is the domain of power and plunder, where every political action is a test of strength  #8212; where might makes right, as the aphorism goes. That has been Trump #8217;s code in his business life, and now in his presidency. America isn #8217;t Colombia or Mexico. But if you #8217;ve ever watched the Netflix drama  #8220;Narcos, #8221; you can see how hard it is to restore the rule of law once it breaks down. When judges and politicians are intimidated into silence and ignore illegality, it requires very brave people to wrest back control. I #8217;ve worked abroad as a journalist in countries where the rule of plunder applied. In such places, where people are prey to warlords and fixers, and courts have collapsed, the law vanishes and extremists provide their own version of order. Two snapshots. It #8217;s June 2011 in Khost, Afghanistan, and Brig. Gen. Mark Martins is showing me a map of the Afghan districts that don #8217;t have government judges or prosecutors; then he shows me a map of districts where the Taliban is strong. They #8217;re the same map. Or it #8217;s October 2003 in Fallujah, Iraq, and Sheik Khamis Hassnawi is explaining to me what will happen if American troops leave quickly and the extremists take over:  #8220;The strong will eat the weak and people will start killing each other in the streets, #8221; he says. Those ravaged, lawless states are not America. But the next time you hear Trump talk about law and order, remember that it #8217;s a code for maintaining his personal power. Three words that Biden should embrace: law, order and justice."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump and his campaign seem to spend their days on constant defense. Cornered and wounded, Trump lashes out, but he appears  #8212; sorry to say  #8212;  #8220;low energy. #8221; Tuesday was no different. First, the administration announced a rare retreat on the issuance of its mind-boggling, self-destructive order to kick out foreign college students whose schooling goes online. Whether this was a cudgel to punish universities and colleges (a favorite target of the right) or simply another mean attack against immigrants care of White House adviser Stephen Miller, the notion that we should kick out the best and brightest students from around the world  #8212; who could stay and be productive here after graduation  #8212; was nonsensical even for this administration. (Ideally, we would slap a green card on every foreign student #8217;s diploma.) It also provoked a tsunami of legal actions from higher education institutions and states. The Post reports:  #8220;The abrupt reversal, disclosed in federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide. #8221; It was also easily evaded as colleges planned to set up single-unit  #8220;seminars #8221; in-person to evade the edict. It is not clear who thought this up, why no one anticipated the outcry and why the administration turned tail. It was emblematic of the administration #8217;s lack of coherent purpose and constructive ideas. What is it trying to accomplish in office, exactly? Well, the administration apparently wants to bully parents to send their kids back to school, just as it bullied governors to reopen businesses with disastrous results. And that brings us to arguably the worst presidential interview in history (except maybe Trump #8217;s 2017 interview with NBC #8217;s Lester Holt in which the president confessed to firing James B. Comey as FBI director because of the Russia investigation). Asked by CBS News #8217;s Catherine Herridge on Tuesday about the spate of police killings of African Americans, Trump had a stunning response:  #8220;So are white people. So are white people. What a terrible question to ask. So are white people, #8221; he said.  #8220;More white people by the way. More white people. #8221; The rate at which African Americans are killed by police is much higher than it is for whites (as the journal Nature reports:  #8220;About 1,000 civilians are killed each year by law-enforcement officers in the United States. By one estimate, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police during their lifetime. And in another study, Black people who were fatally shot by police seemed to be twice as likely as white people to be unarmed #8221;). Even more to the point, Trump #8217;s comment reaffirmed his total lack of interest  #8212; hostility, even  #8212; toward dealing with systemic racism. Trump was not done. Asked about parents #8217; concern about their children #8217;s health in returning to school, the president sneered at their anxiety.  #8220;I would tell parents and teachers that you should find yourself a new person whoever is in charge of that decision because it #8217;s a terrible decision, #8221; he said.  #8220;Because children and parents are dying from that trauma, too. They #8217;re dying because they can #8217;t do what they #8217;re doing. Mothers can #8217;t go to work because all of a sudden they have to stay home and watch their child, and fathers. #8221; They #8217;re dying from being out of school? The statement is so inane and unsympathetic that you wonder whether he is trying to lose female voters, who both as parents and teachers are front and center on this issue. But wait, there #8217;s more! About the Confederate flag  #8212; you know, the flag of the treasonous white nationalists  #8212; Trump said:  #8220;All I say is freedom of speech. It #8217;s very simple. My attitude is freedom of speech. Very strong views on the Confederate flag. With me, it #8217;s freedom of speech. Very simple. Like it, don #8217;t like it, it #8217;s freedom of speech. #8221; Actually, the issue isn #8217;t about free speech insofar as no one is proposing to outlaw it; the goal is to stop venerating it. Trump says people he knows don #8217;t associate it with slavery. I bet. The day was topped off by a Trump news conference that consisted of a 45-minute rambling, incoherent rant. Among other bizarre claims, he said that Democrats did not care whether people blew up their cities and that Joe Biden #8217;s career was  #8220;a gift to the Communist Party. #8221; He seemed to suggest that Biden #8217;s green-energy plan meant we couldn #8217;t have windows, that Biden would do away with the suburbs, that absentee voting and voting by mail are totally different (they aren #8217;t) and that he was about to sign a (nonexistent) immigration act. Flitting from topic to topic, he seemed unable to focus on any one issue for more than a few seconds. His run-on sentences and stray phrases (especially when accusing Biden and former president Barack Obama of doing unspecified bad things) made it impossible at times to make out what he was trying to say. As my Post colleague Philip Rucker reported: [Tweet]  #8220;Trump is now literally unloading an oppo dump on Biden from the Rose Garden. He #8217;s reading aloud from a list of recent Biden alleged atrocities that he said he just asked his staff to prepare for him. #8221; This is a president melting down, in part because he appears unhinged, out of touch and desperate in public statements. Might he consider returning to the White House bunker?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Between President Trump #8217;s Rose Garden rant on Tuesday (which Mary L. Trump should definitely include in the paperback version of her book delving into her uncle #8217;s erratic behavior) and the White House #8217;s excuse that it never authorized trade representative Peter Navarro to write a screed attacking the world #8217;s leading infectious-disease expert, it has become a wee bit difficult for in-house lackeys, elected Republicans and card-carrying members of the right-wing media to keep up the pretense that Trump and his administration are functioning normally  #8212; or even functioning at all. (One wonders how the Hogan Gidleys, the Marc Shorts, the Mark Espers and the rest justify continuing to regurgitate his lies and sing his praises.) Increasingly, the White House operates not so much as the head of the executive branch but as a site for Trump #8217;s personal and political breakdowns. It is hard to see that any official business is performed in an administration obsessed with covering Trump #8217;s lies, catering to his ego, attacking his opponents and providing emotional refuge for those whose identity depends on venerating the Confederate flag and excusing systemic racism. There is almost no actual policy happening and no rationale for the administration #8217;s continued existence. Let #8217;s turn, then, to the Senate Republicans who voted to acquit him (that would be everyone except Utah Sen. Mitt Romney), the House Republicans who mouthed Russian propaganda in his defense and the horde of right-wing pundits and media figures who both financially sustain and humiliate themselves with never-ending rationalizations for a president who struggles to complete a sentence, let alone think through complex policy matters. The elected Republicans should be confronted at every turn by mainstream media and voters:  #8226; Do you think President Trump is fit even to complete his term?  #8226; Do you regret supporting his exoneration in the Ukraine scandal?  #8226; How can you support a president who clings to the Confederate flag and defends the killing of African Americans by police by saying more white people are killed?  #8226; How can the administration address the pandemic when members of the administration heap scorn on Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases?  #8226; Why are you supporting a president who refused to respond to Russian bounties placed on U.S. servicemen and women?  #8226; Does the self-enrichment and corruption bother you, even a little?  #8226; Is there anything he could do or say that would cause you to renounce him? The right-wing media cohort  #8212; including both those helplessly corrupted by the money and fame that goes with feeding Trump #8217;s frenzied base and those with pretensions of respectability (the  #8220;but Gorsuch #8221; crowd, before Gorsuch disappointed them)  #8212; have other concerns. As Laura Ingraham (who reportedly believes  #8220;we have to be prepared for Trump losing #8221;) and the utterly tone deaf Ivanka Trump ( #8220;Find something new! #8221;) advise, they will have to come up with their next act. As in the Obama administration, they will likely become the conspiratorialists and rancid critics of the new administration. No accusation will be too far-fetched, no source of gossip turned away. The spineless sycophants  #8212; who attacked Never Trumpers for their show of integrity, who fashioned disingenuous excuses for Trump and who concoct elaborate rationalizations to oppose voting for former vice president Joe Biden (Socialist!)  #8212; will swear up and down that Hillary Clinton would have been worse. (Really  #8212; denying a pandemic? Inducing supporters not to wear lifesaving masks? Embracing white nationalists? Staffing the White House with a cohort of incompetents? Giving Vladimir Putin a free pass on targeting U.S. troops?) Some will insist they were against Trump all along. Some (a tiny few) will show some modicum of remorse, and some will try to ignore the past four years of intellectual hackery. What  #8220;polite society #8221; (if there is such a thing) must not do is forget their role in sustaining an un-American president whose incompetency has resulted in hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths. The bill is coming due for those who sold their souls to Trump. The voters may boot out a good number of incumbents. The rest of us, however, will have learned how through silence and collaboration a cadre of well-educated comfortable men and women can rationalize and excuse anything. It has been a frightening lesson in human weakness and propensity to accommodate themselves to evil, which should remind us the only thing that really matters in public life is character."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "There are two ways to read both the state and national polling that shows President Trump significantly behind former vice president Joe Biden. You can plausibly argue that the polls are more unreliable on a statewide basis than in 2016, so they #8217;re all irrelevant. Alternatively, you can take the polls at face value and conclude we are heading for a blowout election. There is a case for each. Recall in 2016 that the national polls were quite accurate (Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than two points), while the state polls, albeit some within the margin of error, gave the impression of a narrow but definitive Clinton win. There was much talk about a quiet base of Trump voters embarrassed to say they support him, but in fact, 80,000 votes going the other way would have made Clinton president. (I know. Don #8217;t dwell.) This time around, there is reason to believe we will have all mail-in or heavily mail-in voting in many states. The access to those ballots and the propensity of various groups to use them might be different. In other words, defining  #8220;likely #8221; voters is trickier than you think. Moreover, the  #8220;Who knows? #8221; interpretation of polls posits that lots can happen in four months, so Trump #8217;s chances might improve. (That last part is beginning to fail the straight-face test, as Trump #8217;s performance continues to deteriorate daily and the pandemic worsens.) The alternative theory goes like this: Even if the polls are off, they cannot be that far off. Biden is winning nationally by an average of nearly 9 points (just today Economist-YouGov, a respected, nonpartisan poll, gives him a 9-point lead, and Quinnipiac shows him with a stunning 15-point lead). The big deficit for Trump tracks with his approval rating (one of the best indicators of an incumbent #8217;s election percentage), which has dropped below 40 in several recent polls. Biden is also crushing it in swing states such as Pennsylvania (leading by an eye-popping 13 points in Monmouth #8217;s most recent poll) and is competitive or slightly ahead in states no Democrat has thought competitive in the past decade or so (e.g., Arizona and Texas). Finally, polling for Senate seats shows a tilt toward Democrats even in red states (e.g., Montana and Arizona), giving support to the  #8220;blue tsunami #8221; interpretation of the race. Many Democratic operatives believe the second theory is right but are frankly spooked by 2016 and afraid to say it out loud. Campaigning 101 also says that you should tell your staff, donors and voters to think you are three points behind. The trauma of 2016 and fear of overconfidence have not dissipated. On the other side, Republicans face their own dilemma. At some point, they will have to decide whether they want to effectively give up on Trump. (Labor Day might be too late given the plethora of early voting, which starts, for example, on Sept. 19 in Michigan.) Donors will decide whether to throw money into a hopeless campaign; candidates for Senate and House will begin the ads arguing to not give Biden a  #8220;blank check. #8221; The safest answer would be something like this: If the election were held today, it would be a big win for Biden, and while Trump is unlikely to undergo a believable personality transformation and the coronavirus pandemic might possibly  #8212; if we are fortunate  #8212; be less terrible than now, it is also possible Trump has not hit rock bottom yet. In other words, act like Biden is three points down."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The 15-point lead for former vice president Joe Biden in the Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday seemed to many Democrats too good to be true. Then a NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll dropped, showing an 11-point lead for Biden. Even if you think the polls will narrow as the election gets closer (a good bet) or that President Trump will start acting like a normal president (a bad bet), it is instructive to see why Biden has these big margins and how they correlate with Trump #8217;s increasingly bizarre antics and fractured rhetoric. Trump has lost white women: In 2016, Hillary Clinton (according to later verified results) carried female voters by 15 points (54-39) but lost white women (45-47). In the Quinnipiac poll, Biden leads by a greater margin than Clinton #8217;s final number among all women (59-31) and among white women (55-38). In the NBC-WSJ poll, Biden #8217;s lead is similarly large, at 58 percent to 35 percent (though numbers for white women are not specifically reported). It #8217;s likely that Trump lost so much ground among white women due to a range of policies, from his treatment of women and children at the border to his incendiary language to his lack of concern for the health of schoolchildren returning in the fall. In doing so, he managed to alienate not just a group he won narrowly, but that Republicans have been winning consistently. (These voters went for George W. Bush in 2004, John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.) Trump has lost older voters: Older voters (65 and above) went for Trump in 2016 by nine points. Quinnipiac shows Biden crushing Trump with these voters with a 14-point margin. (The NBC-WSJ poll does not break this group out either.) It was probably bad strategy to threaten to take away Medicaid (via elimination of the Affordable Care Act), which funds nursing home costs, and to be cavalier about older voters #8217; vulnerability during the pandemic. Because these voters (like women) tend to turn out in greater numbers than other segments of the electorate, this is particularly bad news for Trump, especially in states with large numbers of seniors and surging coronavirus cases (e.g., Florida and Arizona). Trump has lost ground with whites without college degrees: Trump did exceptionally well with this group in 2016, winning by 36 points (64-28). His advantage has deteriorated considerably, leading by just 13 points in the Quinnipiac poll and by 22 points in the NBC-WSJ poll. It may be that many of these voters are now suffering badly due to the economy, they resent him trying to take away health care or they are turned off by Trump #8217;s racist appeals. They may have voted for him because he would shake things up or because they disliked Clinton more or because they thought his skills as a businessman would serve him well. Whatever the explanation, that critical group is falling away from Trump, and hugging the Confederate flag and bullying schools to reopen is not helping. Trump is bombing with independent and swing-state voters: These voters chose Trump in 2016 by a narrow 43-42 margin; Quinnipiac now shows him losing the group 34-51. In swing states, Trump is losing by an even larger margin than his overall national vote (12 points), according to the NBC-WSJ poll. Of the 11 battleground states the NBC-WSJ poll surveyed (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), Trump won six in 2016. A 12-point overall deficit in these states suggests he will do much worse in 2020. In sum, the price of appealing so heavily to his far-right, white, evangelical and mostly male base is that Trump has alienated everyone else. Even within core groups, he is not doing as well as he did in 2016. Lo and behold, the NBC-WSJ poll found that 50 percent of all voters say there is no chance they #8217;d vote for him, while 52 percent say they #8217;d be "very uncomfortable. #8221; Biden #8217;s figures are both under 40 percent. If you cannot hold or expand your base and you enrage everyone else, chances are you will lose."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Defund the police" means to move some of the funding from how it's done now over to people who are (for example) trained to deal with mental illness. (The overwhelming percentage of police calls have nothing to do with preventing crime or stopping violence.) Defunding might mean cutting some police jobs, but it would be a better use of the funds, and would actually save lives of people the police simply don't know how to deal with. Guns aren't even kind of needed on something like 90% of police calls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're talking a lot about things you don't know. Police get very little mental health training - clearly not as much as a professional in the field - and often don't try to de-escalate a situation. (Also, I'd like to see you prove that remark about "claimed" mental illness. That's just your opinion, not backed up by studies or stats. Homelessness is hugely related with mental illness, and the homeless get a lot of police attention. Many are vets.) I doubt you'd see a lot of cops quit. I'm not sure what other gigs they could get that would compare in terms of salary and benefits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida said something remarkably stupid the other day. I know, I know: it #8217;s probably harder to find a day on which DeSantis didn #8217;t say something stupid than a day on which he did. But this particular piece of thickheadedness, I #8217;d argue, helps us understand why America #8217;s response to the coronavirus has been so disastrous compared with other wealthy nations. Florida has, of course, become a Covid-19 epicenter, with soaring case totals and a daily death toll now consistently exceeding that of the whole European Union, which has 20 times its population. But DeSantis won #8217;t contemplate any rollback of the state #8217;s obviously premature reopening; he even refuses to close venues that are perfect coronavirus incubators. In particular, he insists on letting gyms  #8212; closed spaces full of people huffing and puffing  #8212; stay open. Why? Because  #8220;if you are in good shape you have a very low likelihood of ending up in a significant condition. #8221; Actually, this isn #8217;t true. Even healthy people can suffer terribly from Covid-19. And if you #8217;ve ever actually gone to a gym, you know that not everyone there is young and fit. But all this is beside the point. The reason we need to close gyms isn #8217;t to protect the people working out, it #8217;s to protect the other people they might infect. Even gym rats have families, friends, and co-workers; the guy lifting weights might be OK, but the senior citizens who get sick because he spent time hanging out in a petri dish might well die. This should be obvious. Yet five months and almost 140,000 deaths into this pandemic, many Republicans still can #8217;t or won #8217;t grasp the point that choices have consequences beyond those to the individual who makes them. Take the insane resistance to wearing masks. Some of this is about insecure masculinity  #8212; people refusing to take the simplest, cheapest of precautions because they think it will make them look silly. Some of it is about culture wars: liberals wear masks, so I won #8217;t. But a lot of it is about fetishization of individual choice. Many things should be left up to the individual. I may not share your taste in music or want to do the same things you do with consenting adults, but such matters aren #8217;t legitimately my business. Other things, however, aren #8217;t just about you. The question of whether or not to dump raw sewage into a public lake isn #8217;t something that should be left up to individual choice. And going to a gym or refusing to wear a mask during a pandemic is exactly like dumping sewage into a lake: it #8217;s behavior that may be convenient for the people who engage in it, but it puts others at risk. Again, this should be obvious. It #8217;s common sense; it is also, as it happens, basic economics. Econ 101 has lots of good things to say about free markets (probably too many good things, but that #8217;s a discussion for another time), but no rational discussion of economics says that free markets, left to themselves, can solve the problem of  #8220;externalities #8221;  #8212; costs that individuals or businesses impose on others who have no say in the matter. Pollution is the classic example of an externality that requires government intervention, but spreading a dangerous virus poses exactly the same issues. Yet many conservatives seem unable or unwilling to grasp this simple point. And they seem equally unwilling to grasp a related point  #8212; that there are some things that must be supplied through public policy rather than individual initiative. And the most important of these  #8220;public goods #8221; is probably scientific knowledge. Some readers may be aware that Senator Rand Paul  #8212; who proclaims himself a libertarian  #8212; has been doing a lot of sniping at Dr. Anthony Fauci. Back in May he denounced Fauci for warning that premature reopening might lead to a surge in new Covid-19 cases. More recently, apparently undaunted by the fact that Fauci was right, he demanded that Fauci show  #8220;humility #8221; and display some  #8220;optimism. #8221; What struck me, however, was the way Paul justified his attacks on epidemiologists #8217; recommendations: by invoking the free-market doctrines of Friedrich Hayek.  #8220;Hayek had it right: Only decentralized power and decision-making, based on millions of individualized situations, can arrive at what risks and behaviors each individual should choose. #8221; Whatever you think of Hayek (as you might guess, I #8217;m not a fan), this is bizarre. Decentralized decision-making can do lots of things, but establishing scientific truth isn #8217;t one of those things. And even conservatives used to understand both that expertise matters and that promoting scientific research is a legitimate and necessary role of government. But conservatives, and Republicans, have changed. The modern American right is all about denying that people have any responsibility for each other, and muzzling experts who try to tell people in power things they don #8217;t want to hear. And the fact that selfishness and willful ignorance are now guiding principles for much of our political establishment is a large part of the reason America is failing the Covid-19 test so spectacularly."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Senate Republicans can read polls. As much as they mouth anti-science claptrap, they can see the coronavirus statistics; they know the pandemic is getting worse. They hear Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell warn that without a massive new stimulus bill, the economy will crater. They see President Trump #8217;s disastrous appearances, especially his horrific interview with  #8220;Fox News Sunday #8221; host Chris Wallace, so they know their opponents in the upcoming election will tie them to the buffoonish, lying and monstrously callous president. You can hear the whiffs of desperation seep into their statements. The New York Times quotes Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.):  #8220;I want more briefings but, more importantly, I want the whole White House to start acting like a team on a mission to tackle a real problem. [Peter] Navarro #8217;s Larry, Moe and Curly junior-high slap fight this week is yet another way to undermine public confidence that these guys grasp that tens of thousands of Americans have died and tens of millions are out of work. #8221; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) knows his bargaining power in talks with the House is drying up. He must pass a bill, and a substantial one at that.  #8220;The spiraling pandemic and the increasingly virulent politics around Washington #8217;s handling of the novel coronavirus are raising the pressure on Senate Republicans as they try to craft a fresh coronavirus relief package," The Post reports.  #8220;As the Senate returns this week for a three-week sprint before the August break, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is facing competing demands from President Trump and Republican senators, including some who are up for reelection in states hit hard by the virus and are coming under withering attacks by Democratic challengers over the pandemic. #8221; Republicans insist that liability protection for employers be included in the stimulus package, but if the House holds firm, will Republicans have the nerve to vote down a stimulus package? I am guessing they won #8217;t. They are not about to let the weekly $600 federal add-on to unemployment insurance benefits lapse. They do not want to face the wrath of their state governments, police, firefighters, teachers and other government workers back home if they do not agree to hundreds of billions in new federal funding. McConnell made a grave error in not striking a deal months ago. Now, as the virus surges and Trump #8217;s standing collapses, he is in a far worse position to extract concessions from the House. The woes of Republican senators do not end there. That #8217;s because their problematic attachment to Trump does not end there. - Will they demand coronavirus data go directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than the politicized Department of Health and Human Services stocked with Trump lackeys? - Will they insist on a provision in the Defense Department appropriations bill that requires the renaming of bases bearing the names of Confederate generals? - Will they remain mute as Trump uses Customs and Border Protection agents as his private goon squad, attacking demonstrators, refusing to identify themselves and hauling demonstrators away in unmarked vehicles? - Will they pass any sort of police reform bill before November? We are interested in hearing about how the struggle to reopen amid the pandemic is affecting people's lives. Please tell us yours. Republicans #8217; self-created plight reminds me of the book title  #8220;Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven But Nobody Wants to Die. #8221; In this case, Republicans all want to get reelected; they simply do not want to do the things they need to do  #8212; incurring Trump #8217;s wrath along the way  #8212; to get to political heaven."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Former vice president Joe Biden has said that if elected, he would not pardon President Trump for any alleged crimes. As a political matter, that makes perfect sense; as a legal matter, it smartly leaves options open. As much as I would love to see the federal government prosecute Trump for potential crimes in office, I fear that criminally prosecuting a predecessor would be so destructive and fraught with peril that it would outweigh any added benefits. (If Trump committed financial crimes unrelated to his official acts in office, that is another matter.) That still leaves open what Biden, if he becomes president, should do regarding Trump. I would suggest two main goals. The first goal should be a complete historical accounting of the reams of scandals and abuses of power in the Trump era. We usually leave it  #8220;to history #8221; to review a presidency, but here we need a swift and definitive legal accounting on issues such as any secret understandings with Russian President Vladimir Putin; the use of federal forces against peaceful demonstrators; the limitations imposed on the FBI in investigating Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing; the firings of inspectors general and more. (I would not recommend redoing the Russia and Ukraine investigations, although coming to a conclusion where then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III would not  #8212; on whether Trump committed crimes  #8212; may be required.) The second goal should be to investigate crimes by others so as to prosecute them and set an example for future administrations. My suggestion would be for Biden #8217;s attorney general to announce on his or her first day in office that everyone in the Justice Department has two weeks to deliver any evidence of crimes or ethical violations by anyone in the department, up to and including the attorney general. Anyone who does not may themselves be the subject of investigation and prosecution. We need a full fumigation of the Justice Department in particular; only when we know who did what can we go about repairing its reputation. The model for accomplishing this must not allow the administration to be preoccupied with Trump. The ideal setup could be a body similar to the 9/11 Commission that could oversee the entire undertaking with subpoena power and an appropriate budget. As was the case with the 9/11 Commission, this one should be co-chaired by one respected Democrat and one respected Republican (or one Republican-appointed judge and a Democratic counterpart). Given the number of areas of concern, there would need to be investigative teams devoted to separate, agreed-upon topics (e.g., one looking at the Trump-Putin relationship, one at misuse of law enforcement, one at illegal directives to department heads on immigration). Set a deadline (a year or two?), and let them do their work. No one in the administration thereafter should answer any questions or make any comments about the entire undertaking; instead, the new administration must go about the business of governing the country. At the end of the investigative process, a report should be published that includes the findings of each team. If Trump has not yet been prosecuted at the state level, the door remains open for Biden to authorize prosecution, but the main task of determining what occurred and who did what will be settled. (Biden should also ask for a recommendation on whether to change Justice Department guidelines that prevent prosecution of a sitting president.) Biden #8217;s team would do well to think through this now so a decision can be announced after November, if he wins. The transition after the election should not get sidetracked from the normal task of setting up an administration. In any case, a truth commission may be key to preventing a Trump-type presidency from occurring again."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "A Russian flunky in the Ukraine parliament has bragged about sending information seeking to incriminate former vice president Joe Biden to the Trump campaign and to a Senate committee headed by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), neither of which will even comment on the matter. If this sounds like deja vu all over again, that #8217;s because it is  #8212; unless Democrats put an end to it. The New York Times reports:  #8220;Top congressional Democrats warned in a cryptic letter they released on Monday that a foreign power was using disinformation to try to interfere in the presidential election and the activities of Congress, and demanded a prompt briefing by the F.B.I. to warn every member of Congress. . . .  #8220;They contend that the Russian-linked information is being funneled to a committee headed by Senator Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who is investigating Mr. Biden and his son, who was once paid as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company. While neither Mr. Johnson #8217;s inquiry nor much of the information in question is new, the Democrats #8217; letter is an attempt to call attention to their concern that the accusations are not only unfounded but may further Russia #8217;s efforts to interfere again in the American presidential election. #8221; This might also explain Biden #8217;s public warning to Russia on Monday not to interfere with the U.S. election. The effort to smear Biden suggests a foreign-influence operation is underway. Per the Times:  #8220;Behind the congressional Democrats #8217; warning are the efforts of a Ukrainian lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, who was educated in a K.G.B.-backed school and was, until recently, closely aligned with a pro-Russian political faction in Ukraine. In May he released tapes of what he said were fragments of telephone conversations between Mr. Biden, then the vice president, and Ukraine #8217;s president at the time, Petro O. Poroshenko. . . . [T]he accusations emanating from Mr. Derkach and others about Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, have either been debunked or not been substantiated by any independent sources. #8221; House Democrats wrote to the FBI on July 13, warning that Congress (not specifically mentioning Johnson) is being targeted by foreigners seeking to manipulate our election. It is not clear if the FBI is looking into the Derkach matter, although the agency has certainly been put on notice. In essence, Democrats are suggesting that a Russian ally is using Johnson to run a smear of Biden. Such a foreign-based campaign makes even some Republicans a tad nervous. Politico reports:  #8220;In December, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who was chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, privately told Johnson that his inquiry could aid Russia, according to two congressional sources familiar with the meeting. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned in February that any derogatory information coming out of Ukraine about any American should be vetted by intelligence agencies because  #8216;Russia is playing us all like a fiddle. #8217; #8221; The Biden camp, for its part, has highlighted the Trump administration #8217;s refusal to even respond to inquires about use of a foreign smear campaign. But responding to these developments is a balancing act for the Biden campaign, which must remain vigilant and not give more air to false accusations. If the Biden campaign feels hamstrung, perhaps Democrats in Congress need to be less guarded. Democrats should consider any of the following: - Call FBI Director Christopher A. Wray to testify publicly about the matter. (To the extent he cannot comment publicly, a closed-door session still has value.) - Pressure Johnson to disavow any efforts to cooperate with a Kremlin-backed stooge. - If Johnson attempts to hold hearings or otherwise air the smears, demand he explain any and all contacts between his office and Russian-backed individuals. - Introduce legislation reaffirming that it is a crime to solicit or receive foreign assistance, including foreign information, for use in a federal election. This is also a test for the media, which in 2016 seized upon the WikiLeaks email dump and wound up doing the Kremlin #8217;s work for it, spreading the contents without aggressively pursuing how they were obtained and what connections existed between the campaign and the Russian cutout operation, WikiLeaks. The Times, Politico and Newsweek have to date appropriately focused not on the content of the discredited smears but on the potential connection between the Kremlin #8217;s favorite Ukrainian and both Johnson and the Trump campaign. That said, they should not relent in demanding to know whether Johnson #8217;s committee and the Trump campaign have received information from foreign sources or if they will refuse to use it. How important will any of this be in the presidential election? A host of other issues  #8212; such as the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and Trump #8217;s own lack of credibility  #8212; are certainly going to be more important to voters than a ham-handed attempt to regurgitate already debunked smears. But any influence on the electoral process should be viewed as a threat, and Biden should directly challenge Trump #8217;s willingness to rely on foreign propaganda  #8212; just as he was in the original Ukraine scandal. The issue highlights precisely why Trump should have been impeached and cannot be trusted with another four years in office."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It #8217;s unlikely that the memorandum signed by President Trump on Tuesday will survive an inevitable legal challenge. Trump ordered the Department of Commerce to exclude immigrants without legal documentation from the calculus used to redistribute congressional seats after the 2020 Census. The Constitution doesn #8217;t articulate any such carve-out, excluding only a subset of the Native American population from the enumeration. Experts tell The Washington Post that there #8217;s little reason to think that the judiciary branch would determine that Trump #8217;s effort is valid. One can hardly be surprised that Trump is trying anyway, given both his willingness to explore the grayer areas of constitutional borders and his indefatigable efforts to exclude immigrants who came to the United States illegally. Separating undocumented immigrants from the population totals used to apportion seats in the House both sends a message about who the White House believes deserves the government #8217;s attention and dilutes the power of areas with large populations of undocumented immigrants. But, of course, it would also change the number of House seats each state receives. And that, over the long term, could be of enormous use to Trump #8217;s political party. Here #8217;s how it works. Consider the population of each state in 2017, as calculated by the University of Michigan #8217;s Population Studies Center. [Chart showing population of each state] The Pew Research Center has estimated what percentage of each state #8217;s population is made up of undocumented immigrants. As you might expect, it #8217;s weighted heavily to California, Texas and states with large urban centers. [Chart showing  #8220;Residents without documentation in state population #8221;] Remove those populations from the total, and you shift how the population is distributed around the country. As it stands, many of the states with large populations of undocumented immigrants are also ones with more seats in the House. [Chart showing  #8220;Curent Distribution of House seats #8221;] If we redistribute seats in the House from the 2010 allocation using the 2017 population estimates, six states lose a seat: Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Four gain one seat  #8212; Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon  #8212; and Texas gains two. But if we do the same redistribution after removing undocumented immigrants from the total, the changes are different. Texas now gets only one more House seat and California loses two. Colorado no longer gains one and Michigan and Minnesota no longer lose one. [Chart showing  #8220;Reassigned Distribution of House seats #8221;] Why does this matter? For one thing because all of the states that gain seats save Oregon have legislatures controlled by Republicans, meaning redrawn House maps that likely advantage the Republican Party. But also because House seats are used to calculate the number of electoral votes each state gets. The number of electoral votes a state receives is the total of its representation in Congress: the number of House seats plus two votes for its two senators. So not only does California lose two House seats, it loses two electoral votes, as well. [Chart showing  #8220;Redistribution of Electoral Votes #8221;] As you probably already noticed, the states losing House seats are mostly ones that Trump lost in 2016. The states gaining seats are mostly states he won. [Chart showing  #8220;How the 2016 results would have changed #8221;] So allocating electoral votes by state (which isn #8217;t always how it works), Trump won 305 electoral votes in 2016 to Hillary Clinton #8217;s 233. Had the redistribution of electoral votes using the 2017 population estimates been in effect, he would have won 306 to 232  #8212; a 2-vote improvement in his margin. If you exclude undocumented immigrants from 2017 state populations and reallocate House seats, his lead expands to 308 to 230. That #8217;s a 6-vote improvement over the estimated 2016 results. Trump certainly believes that undocumented immigrants should be excluded from consideration equivalent to American citizens or legal residents. He has made that abundantly clear over the past five years. It #8217;s also the case, though, that the Republican Party has explored how to use citizenship to reduce the power of Democratic states in ways that mirror Trump #8217;s memorandum. So, yes, this is about Trump #8217;s specific politics on immigration. But it #8217;s also obviously an effort to more generally solidify Republican power."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "China #8217;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, says the U.S.-China relationship is at its lowest ebb since the two nations reestablished diplomatic relations in 1979. He blames the United States for a policy that is  #8220;fraught with emotions and whims and McCarthyist bigotry. #8221; Meanwhile, many U.S. commentators  #8212; not all of them right-wingers  #8212; blame China for what is increasingly being described as a new Cold War. Who #8217;s right? I #8217;d say China is largely to blame for the confrontation  #8212; but President Trump is entirely to blame for our self-defeating response. President Xi Jinping has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, and he is acting more recklessly than China did in the days when it had a collective leadership. Chinese troops clashed in June with Indian forces along their border in the Himalayas. China is redoubling its efforts to assert sovereignty over the South China Sea in violation of international law; its coast guard recently sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in disputed waters. China #8217;s repression of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority, is rising to the level of genocide. And China has trampled on Hong Kong #8217;s autonomy in violation of its 1984 handover agreement with Britain. In the past, when China was criticized, its response was usually muted. Not anymore. These days it practices  #8220;wolf warrior #8221; diplomacy. When Australia called for an international inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, China retaliated with trade sanctions and suspected cyberattacks. After Canada detained the chief financial officer of the Chinese technology company Huawei on a U.S. warrant in 2018, China imprisoned two innocent Canadians.  #8220;We treat our friends with fine wine, #8221; says China #8217;s ambassador to Sweden,  #8220;but for our enemies we have shotguns. #8221; China #8217;s behavior is thuggish and unacceptable. But Trump has also contributed to the fraying of ties. While lavishly praising Xi  #8212; and reportedly approving of his crackdown on Uighurs  #8212; Trump has waged a trade war against China and falsely accused China of intentionally spreading the coronavirus (which he calls, with his trademark racism,  #8220;kung flu #8221;). Now he is demonizing China in order to smear Joe Biden as a Manchurian candidate. Some of the steps that the administration has taken to push back on China make sense. For instance, it ended Hong Kong #8217;s preferential economic treatment, imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials for the mistreatment of Uighurs, lobbied U.S. allies to reject Huawei #8217;s 5G technology, rejected  #8220;most #8221; of Beijing #8217;s claims in the South China Sea and sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the South China Sea. But Trump #8217;s trade war cost U.S. consumers billions of dollars and did not result in meaningful changes in Chinese trade practices. It #8217;s not clear whether Phase 1 of the trade deal, with China promising to buy more U.S. goods, will ever be fully implemented, and Trump has lost interest in a second phase, because it #8217;s more politically advantageous to fight with China. Trump will harm U.S. universities if he kicks out more Chinese students beyond the approximately 3,000 to 5,000 who have had their visas revoked because they were affiliated with universities tied to China #8217;s military. Imagine if China retaliated by barring students from the hundreds of U.S. universities that have Defense Department contracts. Already, Trump #8217;s decision to expel 60 Chinese journalists in retaliation for the expulsion of three U.S. reporters from China has backfired, leading Beijing to kick out more U.S. journalists. One of the journalists who was expelled wrote that  #8220;the American press corps in China #8221; has been  #8220;gutted. #8221; That makes it harder to understand what China is doing. Now Trump is weighing a travel ban on all members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families  #8212; as many as 270 million people  #8212; most of whom have no say in Xi #8217;s decision-making. This is nativism masquerading as a  #8220;get tough on China #8221; approach. If Trump really wanted to hurt China, he would offer to take in the beleaguered people of Hong Kong, as Britain has already done. More broadly, Trump helps Beijing with his anti-globalist agenda. Who benefits when Trump pulls out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Iran nuclear deal? You guessed it: China. Trump is creating a power vacuum that Xi can fill. China is promoting an Asian trade agreement that excludes the United States, playing a more prominent role in the WHO and negotiating a strategic pact with Iran that could lead to $400 billion in Chinese investment over 25 years. If we are serious about confronting China, we need to reassert U.S. global leadership and get our own house in order. We are losing the competition to China when, as on Monday, China had 22 new coronavirus cases and we had more than 62,000. China #8217;s economy has already started growing again while the U.S. economy continues to tread water. Effectively competing with China abroad will require improving governance at home  #8212; and that starts with voting Trump out of office. There #8217;s a good reason many observers think Beijing wants another Trump term: No one does more to hurt America and help China than our feckless president."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "When millions of Americans began losing their jobs in March, the federal government stepped in with a life preserver: $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits to allow workers to pay rent and buy groceries, and to cushion the economy. With economic conditions again deteriorating, that life preserver will disappear within days if Congress doesn #8217;t act to extend it. That could prompt a wave of evictions and inflict more financial harm on millions of Americans while further damaging the economy. Even the threat of a lapse in benefits could prove harmful, economists warn, by forcing households to make precautionary spending cuts. The benefits program, Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation, expires at the end of July. But because of a quirk in the calendar, workers in most states won #8217;t qualify for the payments after this week. Most will be left with regular unemployment benefits, which total only a few hundred dollars a week in many states. That means that more than 20 million Americans could soon see their weekly income fall by half or more at a time when the unemployment rate remains higher than in any period since World War II. Economists warn that it isn #8217;t just individual recipients who will suffer if the benefits are cut. The federal payments are injecting billions of dollars into the economy each week, money that flows to landlords, grocery stores, retailers and countless other businesses. Ernie Tedeschi, a former Treasury Department official and an economist at Evercore ISI Research, has estimated that if the payments ceased, the U.S. gross domestic product would be 2 percent smaller at the end of 2020 and there would be 1.7 million fewer jobs nationwide.  #8220;These unemployment benefit checks are really doing a large job in propping up spending by these unemployed households, #8221; said Joseph Vavra, a University of Chicago economist who has been studying the impact of the benefits. If they expire, he said,  #8220;there #8217;s a good chance that what is now an unemployment problem becomes a foreclosure crisis and eviction crisis. #8221; Congress returned from recess this week to consider a new relief package, which could include at least a partial extension of the extra unemployment benefits. Senate Republicans and the White House are considering a roughly $1 trillion package that would retain the program but scale it back. Democrats are pressing to continue paying the full $600 a week. But Congress seems unlikely to act before benefits lapse. And because of the antiquated computer systems in many state unemployment offices, which do the processing, it could take weeks to restart payments. That means that millions are likely to see their income drop at least temporarily. For people depending on the checks, that uncertainty is frustrating.  #8220;I have no idea why Congress would wait until a few days before the checks are going to run out, #8221; said Jacob Perlman, a benefits recipient in Chicago.  #8220;This should have been done a month ago. #8221; Mr. Perlman, 26, earned $12 an hour as a housekeeper at a fitness club, making him one of the millions of Americans earning more on unemployment than they had on the job. But he is eager to return to work.  #8220;The jobs simply are not there right now, #8221; he said. Mr. Perlman #8217;s regular benefits from the state of Illinois total $159 a week, barely enough to cover his $500 share of the monthly rent, let alone food or other expenses. So he is already trying to save as much as possible. Decisions like Mr. Perlman #8217;s to curtail spending even before the benefits expire, multiplied across millions of households, are a sort of uncertainty tax on the broader economy, damping the stimulative effect of the payments.  #8220;There are people who are on the precipice of financial disaster here, #8221; said David Wilcox, a former Federal Reserve official who is an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  #8220;We may think that the odds are that Congress will come to a reasonable conclusion. But for a person who is on the precipice of financial disaster, it #8217;s very low comfort to be told,  #8216;You know, I think there #8217;s a 70 percent chance that this is going to work out fine. #8217; #8221; The risk is particularly acute for Black and Latino workers, who have been disproportionately affected by job losses and are less likely to have savings or other assets to fall back on. A recent working paper from researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that Black and Latino households cut spending by far more than white households when their income drops.  #8220;When 30 percent of your population has no wealth, this has real implications, #8221; said William E. Spriggs, a Howard University professor and the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.  #8220;There isn #8217;t a piggy bank. This is it. So when you cut their benefits, their drop in consumption is going to be huge. #8221; The extra unemployment payments were part of a multitrillion-dollar federal response to the pandemic #8217;s economic devastation. Congress expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits and food stamps, sent $1,200 checks to most households and offered forgivable loans to millions of small businesses. Together, those programs did much to offset the damage: Average personal income rose in April, the worst month of the crisis to date, and consumer spending rebounded quickly once federal dollars started flowing into the economy. Mortgage delinquencies, credit card defaults and other signs of financial stress rose by less than many forecasters initially feared."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "WASHINGTON  #8212;  #8220;I #8217;m not losing, #8221; President Trump insisted in an interview on Sunday with the Fox News anchor Chris Wallace after being presented with the cable network's latest poll, which showed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with an eight-point advantage nationally. The president, who often promotes poll numbers when they are favorable to him  #8212; and even regularly advertises what he claims is a  #8220;96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party #8221; without citing any source for that questionable statistic  #8212; said the public polls that showed him losing were  #8220;fake in 2016, and now they #8217;re even more fake. #8221; There aren #8217;t many campaign metrics out there these days to buoy a president who loves to cite a record he has shattered. He hasn #8217;t been able to pack a stadium with supporters since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and Mr. Biden has out-raised him for two months in a row. Unlike Hillary Clinton #8217;s slim lead in national polls four years ago, Mr. Biden has held a nearly double-digit lead in an average of polls for more than a month. In response, the Trump campaign has highlighted the meaningless marker of  #8220;boat parades #8221; as a measure of voter enthusiasm. The most recent shattered record Mr. Trump has touted online is a heat index.  #8220;We may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat, #8221; Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday, referring to his outdoor interview with Mr. Wallace.  #8220;It was 100 degrees, making things very interesting! #8221; Meanwhile, his campaign and his top advisers have echoed his attempts to discredit public polls, in an effort to treat them, dismissively, as an extension of  #8220;the media. #8221; The Trump team sent a cease-and-desist letter to CNN after it published a June poll that showed Mr. Trump losing to Mr. Biden. (The network said it stood by its poll.) And in a recent interview with Newsweek, the president #8217;s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is overseeing Mr. Trump #8217;s campaign, dismissed public polling as  #8220;all b.s. #8221; Privately, aides said, Mr. Trump knows things aren #8217;t looking good for him  #8212; he just thinks the public polls are overstating the situation. His campaign does not conduct national polls, but aides have presented him with internal data about battleground states that show a closer race than the public polling numbers. His pollsters tell him regularly that he is in a close race and that there is more polling bias in the news media today than there was four years ago, a claim untethered to any measurable metric. They assure him that his base is still enthusiastically engaged and that the middle that might have been planning to vote for him in March has moved away through no fault of his own. That has helped lead Mr. Trump to think that the public polls are overstating Mr. Biden #8217;s advantage, advisers said, and that they offer only a snapshot in time. But his internal numbers still show him trailing Mr. Biden, and he is worried about his standing. He asks his advisers with more regularity,  #8220;What do we need to do? #8221; and grills his friends about  #8220;how is it looking? #8221; while making public course corrections, the advisers said. Over the past several weeks, he changed his stance on promoting masks, claiming that it was  #8220;patriotic #8221; to wear one, and resuscitated the daily coronavirus news conference  #8212; both an acknowledgment that he needs to be seen as taking the virus seriously again. On Tuesday evening, campaign aides circulated a news story from CNBC, in which the host Jim Cramer said that Mr. Trump #8217;s belated endorsement of face coverings had sparked a rally in recovery stocks. The president also unceremoniously demoted his longtime campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and his campaign has shifted the majority of its advertising resources to a message of law and order, claiming inaccurately in a new television ad spot that if Mr. Biden is elected, the country #8217;s police departments will cease to exist. His political opponents assume he knows he is losing, and badly, and that his blanket dismissal of public polling as  #8220;fake #8221; is part of a strategy to sow doubt and confusion in November.  #8220;Saying the polls are fake helps in laying the predicate for claiming the election is rigged, #8221; said William Kristol, the conservative writer and prominent  #8220;Never Trump #8221; Republican.  #8220;Because his brand going forward depends on his being a victim of a rigged system, not accepting defeat. He has a general interest in discrediting the truth, and this is part of an assault on the truth. #8221; But aides said that even in private conversations, Mr. Trump has not let the reality of his current political standing fully sink in.  #8220;No one #8217;s ever come back from something like this, #8221; said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, referring to Mr. Biden #8217;s polling lead over Mr. Trump. Indeed, it has been almost 25 years since Bill Clinton sustained such a gaping advantage over his opponent, Bob Dole, in 1996. But when donors and outside allies have been blunt with Mr. Trump and told him that he is, in fact, losing, the president has pushed back, claiming that things are getting better and there #8217;s still plenty of time for improvement, according to Republicans familiar with these conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private exchanges. Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.  #8220;My polls show we #8217;re getting real movement since Rushmore, #8221; Mr. Trump has told multiple associates, referring to his Fourth of July address at Mount Rushmore, in which he framed the campaign as a battle against a  #8220;new far-left fascism #8221; seeking to wipe out the nation #8217;s values and history. White House advisers viewed the speech as a success, if a temporary one that was quickly overtaken by Mr. Trump #8217;s defense of the Confederate flag. Yet the Biden campaign has not seen a real improvement in how voters view Mr. Trump since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a person who was familiar with the campaign #8217;s data. Voters #8217; impressions of Mr. Trump, the person said, have only grown more negative. In private conversations, Mr. Trump has also brought up the general election debates as an opportunity for him to improve his standing in the race, telling allies he expects his opponent to perform poorly in that format."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Jonathan V. Last of the Bulwark sets forth a scary scenario for a political world after President Trump #8217;s defeat (though not nearly as scary as the scenario if he wins and continues his authoritarian rampage): - Trump claims that he won the election and was cheated out of the White House. No Republicans make more than a demonstration of contradicting him. Most Republicans actively affirm his claim. - Trump continues to tweet about politics on an hourly basis, and many elected Republicans take their marching orders from him. The direction of the party continues to emanate from the person of Trump and fixates on grievances and the culture war. This is precisely why groups such as the Lincoln Project and Republican Voters Against Trump are seeking not merely to dislodge Trump but to subject the Republican Party to such devastating losses up and down the ticket that: 1) there is no question as to who the winner is; 2) the Republican Party understands that right-wing nationalism does not play in 21st-century America; and 3) ordinary Republican voters are encouraged to  #8220;give permission #8221; to others to hop off the Trump bandwagon and cast aside Trumpism. One measure of devastation for Trump #8217;s party would be the loss of traditional red states. Right now, things are looking bleak in states that were never seriously in contention before 2020. A new Quinnipiac poll from Texas shows,  #8220;Voters are split on the way [Gov. Greg] Abbott is handling the response to the coronavirus with 47 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving. It #8217;s a 21-point swing in the net approval from early June when 56 percent of voters approved and 36 percent disapproved. #8221; Trump remains in negative territory both on handling of the pandemic (45 percent approve vs. 52 percent disapprove) and his job as president overall (45 percent vs. 51 percent). The poll is not an outlier. Going back to the beginning of May, Trump has never been ahead by more than four points in the state. Since then, polls have either been tied or close between the two candidates. By any definition, the centerpiece of Republicans #8217; electoral base is now a true toss-up. It matters how much Trump loses by, where he loses (which states and which areas within states), and whom he takes down with him. Contrary to conventional wisdom that Republicans will never break with him on anything, we have recently seen mild signs of independence from Senate Republicans (for example, on bases named for Confederate generals and on the payroll tax). And we have seen a peep here and there on the right voicing dissent on the use of unidentified, camouflaged agents from the Department of Homeland Security in the streets of Portland (and perhaps to be deployed elsewhere). If the losses are devastating enough and the national repudiation of Trump obvious enough, the Trump cult may fade. The reported fight within the House Republican caucus between the No. 3 Republican in leadership, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), and the Trump sycophants in the Freedom Caucus is indicative of not only the Republicans #8217; hostility toward women (see also Florida Rep. Ted Yoho #8217;s vile cursing at N.Y. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as his non-apology apology), but also of a rift on loyalty to the president. Should Trump lose badly in November, who will be in a stronger position, Cheney or Trump #8217;s lackeys? Republicans have been sitting on a demographic time bomb for several elections. They face an electorate that is less white than the electorate four years ago. They have tried to extend that through voter suppression and gerrymandering, but they can only hang on for so long (especially if Democrats whittle away at their barriers by passing redistricting reform and voting-rights legislation). If you want to know why it is so important for Republicans to repudiate Trump, the answer lies not so much in the outcome but on the impact of 2020 on the party. Unlike Trump and impeachment, they really need to learn a lesson in the political peril of Trumpism."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "One of the obvious reasons that President Trump has resumed regular coronavirus press briefings is poll data. Recent data indicating broad skepticism about Trump #8217;s handling of the pandemic and increased support for his probable opponent in November #8217;s election clearly spurred the White House to resume the briefings, in the hope that voters would shift their perceptions of how Trump has handled the crisis. Trump, never a staunch adherent to the concept of subtlety, tried to put a fine point on where he thinks blame should lie for the recent surge in new cases.  #8220;There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections, #8221; he said.  #8220;Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations, which you know very well about, which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. #8221;  #8220;A substantial increase in travel also was a cause, #8221; he added.  #8220;Increased gathering on holidays such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places. #8221; That he led with the demonstrations  #8212; national Black Lives Matter protests that emerged following the killing of George Floyd when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck  #8212; was pointed. His allies have consistently pointed to the protests as the cause of the surge, for the same reason that Trump does: It shifts blame. That Trump additionally blamed the protests for  #8220;triggering a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts, #8221; however, is ludicrous. It #8217;s Trump himself who triggered that relaxation, pushing states months ago to scale back efforts to contain the virus  #8212; again because he worried that slower economic activity would hurt his reelection chances. [ #8220;LIBERATE MICHIGAN! #8221; tweet] It #8217;s a point worth considering, though: Were those large protests a trigger for the surge? The data suggests that they weren #8217;t. A working paper released last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found  #8220;no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset. #8221; Nor are the states where cases surged the most ones in which the largest protests occurred. The eight states that added the most new daily cases relative to the daily average on the day Floyd died were Montana, Alaska, Idaho, Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Oregon and Arizona. While there were protests in each of those states, most were fairly small. [Graph showing rapidly rising cases in states that didn #8217;t have huge demonstrations] There were protests in every state around June 1, in fact, with many of the largest in California and New York. Protests in D.C. gained national attention after the White House forcibly broke one up to allow Trump to have a photo op at a nearby church. One would expect new cases to show within two weeks of infection, by about June 15. California did add cases after May 25, which the mayor of Los Angeles attributed in part to the protests in his city. (Experts have raised questions about the link, in part because the daily average of new cases in the county was already rising.) But in New York and D.C., cases declined in the weeks after the protests. Cases also declined in Minnesota, the epicenter of the protests as the site of Floyd #8217;s killing. [Graph showing cases rising slowly in states that did have large demonstrations] It #8217;s admittedly often hard to trace the source of these outbreaks with specificity. The mayor of Los Angeles isn #8217;t the only public official to link protests to new cases; a health official in Tulsa pointed to the protests as a reason cases resurged in his city  #8212; along with a political rally held by Trump. Shortly after Trump spoke to the press, though, another expert weighed in. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, was interviewed by Fox News #8217;s Bret Baier. She noted that the recent surge was unlike the surge that engulfed the Northeast in March and April.  #8220;This time we saw wide virus spread across counties, across rural areas, across small metros and big metros, all the way across the South, Southwest and West almost simultaneously, #8221; she said.  #8220;So this is an event that we think can be traced to Memorial Day and opening up and people traveling again and being on vacations. #8221; The same mention of Memorial Day  #8212; but none of the protests. Of course, she #8217;s not running for reelection."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It is almost as if President Trump is administering a test to sycophantic Republican politicians. He seems to be probing just how far intellectually corrupted right-wingers will go to defend him. Consider just this week: - Trump announced plans to send federal shock troops to U.S. cities without invitation from state or local authorities for vaguely stated reasons that shift daily (Federal property destruction? Gun crimes?). - He sent well wishes to the alleged co-conspirator in a child sex ring, affirming they met many times. - Notwithstanding any  #8220;tone #8221; change, he reiterated his belief that the novel coronavirus will  #8220;disappear #8221; one day. - The economy, predictably, took a downturn, with 1.4 million new unemployment claims (the first increase in months) as states that followed Trump #8217;s lead are forced to re-close. - Trump #8217;s only contribution in discussions regarding a new stimulus package was a widely derided payroll tax cut proposal, which is now reportedly dead. - Trump continued to press forward with a convention in Jacksonville, Fla., over the strong opposition of local residents and despite the state #8217;s distinction as one of the worst hot spots in the nation. - Trump #8217;s refusal to confirm he will accept the results of the election spurred widespread anxiety about a constitutional crisis and/or civil unrest by his aggrieved cultists. And through it all, Trump has remained obsessed with a test he recently passed that is used to rule out dementia, inadvertently making himself a laughingstock and confirming the vast gap between his self-regard and reality. Republicans #8217; political fortunes are already grim. As many as nine Republican-held Senate seats are at risk. The Cook Political Report and political guru Larry Sabato continue to move House seats toward the Democrats. Republicans #8217; fortunes will not improve so long as they ignore the proverbial elephant in the room. Trump is the source of domestic clashes. Trump is responsible for the failure to set up a national testing and tracking program. Trump is accountable for months-long flouting of masks, even assembling thousands of followers in Tulsa for a rally. Trump is the cause of the economic collapse, apparently not yet at rock bottom  #8212; the natural result of an unchecked pandemic and his misguided view that if you simply get people back to work, the economy will bounce back. Trump is to blame for worsening racial conflict and violence, choosing to use federal forces in Lafayette Square, Portland, Ore., and now Chicago. The media has been remarkably lenient with Republican officeholders. Each of them needs to be quizzed: - Is Trump endangering our democracy by refusing to pledge to accept the election results? - Will you make that pledge and denounce Trump #8217;s attempts to provoke a constitutional crisis? - Would you accept a Democratic president #8217;s deployment of unidentified troops to states and cities with no specific legislative authorization or defined federal purpose? - Why do you defend states #8217; rights when it comes to policing practices of local authorities but not object to imposition of federal forces on localities? - Can you characterize the death of more than 140,000 Americans and the economic recession as a success? Republicans risk the wrath and scorn of voters for defending a failed president. The worse the virus, the worse the economy and the worse the Trump-instigated violence, the more evident it becomes to Americans that Trump #8217;s defenders are dangerous enablers whose denial  #8212; nearly on a par with Trump #8217;s  #8212; is leading the country to ruin."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "In a revealing aside, President Trump told chief propagandist Sean Hannity on Thursday night that he traces much of the overwhelming enthusiasm for his reelection now sweeping the country back to his Mount Rushmore speech commemorating Independence Day.  #8220;Since that time, it #8217;s been really something," Trump told Hannity, before raging that fake polls are deliberately obscuring the mighty depth and reach of his support. In that speech, Trump offered his canonical statement on the unleashing of federal law enforcement into cities, conflating protests against police brutality and systemic racism with a  #8220;far-left fascism #8221; out to  #8220;take #8221; our  #8220;national heritage #8221; away from the  #8220;American people. #8221; At around the time Trump appeared on  #8220;Hannity, #8221; all four Major League Baseball teams playing Opening Day games took a knee in solidarity with Black Lives Matter before the national anthem, flatly defying Trump #8217;s relentless disparaging of the protests, and more broadly, the vision outlined in that speech. In all kinds of ways, Trump #8217;s depiction of this national moment, as enshrined in that speech, is losing its grip on the country. In some cases, Trump #8217;s own officials are defying his efforts to carry that depiction to the authoritarian climax he so craves. Meanwhile, Trump #8217;s sinking popularity  #8212; which is linked to that loosening grip, as his efforts to impose that understanding on us are surely helping drive his numbers down  #8212; is leading to open defiance among his own party. Here #8217;s a roundup: **Players take a knee**. The support for Black Lives Matter at those baseball openings was remarkable, coming after Trump had fumed that any kneeling during the anthem would render the game  #8220;over for me. #8221; This didn #8217;t represent total defiance of Trump, since two of the four teams stood for the anthem itself. Yet two teams did defy him by kneeling through it. And all four pointedly ratified the gesture of kneeling, while expressing organized support for the protests in numerous other ways. Trump cheerleader Rudolph W. Giuliani raged over this support for BLM, obviously seeing it as repudiation of Trump. **NASCAR bans Confederate flag**. That echoes Nascar #8217;s decision to ban the Confederate flag even as Trump made a last stand in defense of military installations being named for Confederate traitors. Trump himself interpreted the ban as open defiance of him, raging that it caused the  #8220;lowest ratings EVER, #8221; which was a lie. As an aside, such gestures track with other solidaristic displays throughout corporate America. It #8217;s sometimes correctly argued that these only go so far while private-sector economic power remains unwilling to reform deeper racial wealth and income inequalities. But such displays can reveal deep cultural shifts roiling customer bases, which can portend more change ahead. **Republicans defy Trump on Confederacy**. With overwhelming GOP support, the Senate just passed a defense authorization bill requiring the renaming of military installations honoring Confederate generals. Trump had raged against the move, nonsensically equating it with disrespecting the military, but Republicans defied him in broad daylight. **Some Republicans move forward with vote-by-mail**. Some GOP state officials are moving forward with efforts to implement vote-by-mail even though Trump has raged that it will be fraudulent, explicitly declaring he opposes it because it could harm his party (i.e., him) in the election. In a sense, this, too, ties back to the Mount Rushmore speech. Trump is asserting that the election #8217;s results will be illegitimate if he doesn #8217;t prevail, which is tantamount to suggesting that in such an outcome, his people, the real American people, will inevitably be getting cheated and supplanted (the country is being  #8220;taken #8221; from them) by those other people. Yet remarkably, some Republicans think their own constituents should be able to vote safely in a pandemic, even if they vote against Trump. The jockeying for the post-Trump future of the Republican Party has started, says Post columnist Max Boot. (Video: Joy Sharon Yi, Kate Woodsome/Photo: Johnathan Newton/Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) **Military officials defy Trump on Insurrection Act**. After Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 to send the military into cities, his defense secretary distanced himself, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman put out a remarkable statement calling on members of the military to reaffirm their commitment to our founding documents and values. Both men surely grasped that by joining Trump #8217;s Bible photo-op in an area violently cleared of protesters, they had been corrupted by him, and moved to preserve their reputations. Trump saw the Bible stunt as a glorious turnaround moment, but his numbers have continued sliding since, which is telling, since it stood as a kind of iconic representation of the values later expressed in the Mount Rushmore speech. **Defense secretary finds Portland crackdown problematic**. Mark T. Esper let it be known that he raised internal concerns that he was troubled by the fact that homeland security agents descending on Portland, Ore., were wearing garb that would confuse people into seeing them as military. But the whole point of this display was to create exactly this imagery of a hyper-militarized response to the protests, on Trump #8217;s twisted belief that this would help him politically. Once again, officials declared the display and its underlying intentions themselves to be profoundly problematic. **Officials mute Trump #8217;s desire for another authoritarian crackdown**. Trump privately wanted a massive law enforcement invasion of Chicago to emulate the crackdown in Portland that thrilled him, the Daily Beast reports. But the final plan was dialed down into a joint-task-force arrangement combating gangs, allowing him to swagger about sending in tin soldiers without precipitating high-profile clashes. Trump #8217;s handlers surely know those clashes reveal him as an instigating force, hurting him with swing voters. And that #8217;s another sign of the big story here: His glorious Mount Rushmore vision has no hold on the middle of the country."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "For months, President Trump belittled Joseph R. Biden Jr. as an opponent cowering in the basement in a mask as he sought to dismiss the seriousness of a pandemic threatening the nation #8217;s health  #8212; and his re-election prospects. But with his sudden embrace of masks and the canceling of the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Fla., on Thursday, Mr. Trump has reluctantly conceded to the reality of a political landscape that has been transformed by disease and fear. A pandemic that once struck Democratic states like New York and California has moved with alarming force into red America and helped to recast his contest with Mr. Biden, his presumptive Democratic opponent. Mr. Trump #8217;s attempt to downplay the coronavirus, or deride it as a threat exaggerated by his Democratic opponents and the media, has met the reality of rising caseloads, death counts and overwhelmed intensive care units in places like Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Florida, all states that he won in 2016 and that the Biden campaign had until now viewed as long shots. The president #8217;s handling of the virus is shaping up as not only a policy failure, but also a political one. Rather than strengthening his position against Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump #8217;s response to the virus appears to have created a backlash among voters  #8212; one that has only elevated his opponent.  #8220;The movement of Covid into the South and West has finally caught up with Trump, #8221; said Linda L. Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College.  #8220;While the disease was decimating blue states, he was able to pretend it wasn #8217;t happening. But now the context has changed considerably and his people are hurting, underscored by the sinking poll numbers, the problems for G.O.P. congressional candidates, and the fact that the party faithful was reluctant to attend the convention. #8221; The political perils of Mr. Trump #8217;s course were driven home a few hours before he announced he was scrapping the Florida convention. A Quinnipiac poll found that Mr. Biden was now leading Mr. Trump in Florida by 13 percentage points, a stunning margin in a state that has become  #8212; since the recount in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush  #8212; Exhibit A of a nation where elections are decided by decimal points. National and battleground state polls over the past two weeks suggest how much Mr. Trump is out of step with the nation on the pandemic, in contrast with Mr. Biden. Most Americans support the use of masks and are apprehensive about students returning to school or the reopening of cities. And they have lost confidence in the president #8217;s ability  #8212; or willingness  #8212; to steer the country out of a crisis, to the decided advantage of Mr. Biden. A Washington Post-ABC News poll this past week found that Americans trusted Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump to handle the Covid-19 crisis by a double-digit margin, 54 percent to 34 percent. With the election less than four months away, and with no evidence that Mr. Biden was being hurt by campaigning in a mask and supporting tough measures to contain the virus, Mr. Trump had little choice but to at least try to change course.  #8220;He #8217;s wearing a mask and canceling the convention, #8221; said Mark McKinnon, who was in charge of advertising for President George W. Bush #8217;s re-election campaign in 2004.  #8220;That #8217;s a head-snapping reversal for a guy who hates to be wrong, hates to back down and, worst of all, hates to be perceived as weak. #8221; The canceling of the Florida convention would appear, for now, to also play to the Democrats #8217; advantage. Mr. Biden and his aides no longer have to worry that his scaled-down virtual acceptance speech would look small and silly next to a full-blown speech by Mr. Trump, as Republicans had once hoped. And the Democrats cut back their convention methodically and with no drama and little notice, calibrating to the worsening pandemic and to the cautions of medical professionals against large gatherings. By contrast, Mr. Trump and his party stumbled into this decision, a long and messy process that included a last-minute switch of the convention to Florida from North Carolina. The chaos surrounding the convention planning mirrored the chaos that surrounded decision-making on many issues in the White House, including Covid-19. Mr. Trump announced the cancellation at the start of his Thursday coronavirus briefing, with no real plan about what, if anything, the Republicans would do in its stead.  #8220;The Republicans now have a month to put together a remote convention and the Democrats had a three-month head start, #8221; Ms. Fowler said.  #8221;And they have wasted a lot of money. It sort of reinforces the competence problems that this administration has been dealing with. #8221; Mr. Trump, who has long been a master of imagery, had been hoping to draw a contrast with Mr. Biden, downplaying the seriousness of the virus as he pushed to open cities, hold big rallies and gather for conventions like the one he wanted in Jacksonville. His stance recalled the long history of Republicans portraying themselves as unbending, resilient and self-sufficient  #8212; the purported party of strength. (It also recalled the swagger with which Mr. Trump approached his real estate dealings when he was a developer in New York.)  #8220;The Trump strategy was to campaign as the strong man, #8221; Mr. McKinnon said. While Mr. Biden was hidden  #8220;in a mask in a basement he would be stepping maskless into adoring crowds at a packed convention. #8221; But over the past two weeks, mask requirements have been imposed at Walmart, Target, CVS and McDonald #8217;s. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, started showing up in the Capitol wearing a mask. These days, it is a maskless Mr. Trump who looks the outlier  #8212; not Mr. Biden showing up at a campaign event with a piece of black cloth draped over his mouth."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): WASHINGTON  #8212; A conservative Republican House member profanely accosts a Democratic congresswoman as she strides up the Capitol steps to do her job during multiple national calamities. With expanded jobless benefits supporting tens of millions of fearful Americans about to expire and a pandemic raging, Senate Republicans and the Trump White House cannot agree among themselves about how to respond, let alone begin to bargain with Democrats. In a private party session, archconservative Republicans ambush their top female leader and demand her ouster over political and policy differences. And that #8217;s just the past few days. By nearly any measure, Congress is a toxic mess seemingly incapable of rising to the occasion even at a time of existential threats. No one knows that better than those who, until recently, served there.  #8220;Congress has largely become a dysfunctional institution unable to meet the critical needs of our country, #8221; says a new report,  #8220;Congress at a Crossroads, #8221; produced by the Association of Former Members of Congress. Scheduled to be issued publicly next week, it is a damning indictment of the steady deterioration of a congressional culture that today rewards power over progress and conflict over consensus. And it warns that, while recent moves to allow Congress to function safely during the pandemic may be necessary, they could make things worse. Based on 40 hours of interviews with 30 House members and a senator who left Congress after the 2018 elections after serving a combined 275 years, the report offers some hope, asserting that most lawmakers arrive on Washington yearning to be constructive. But overall, it paints a grim portrait of an institution that has ceased to work as it should. A course correction may be more critical now than ever before, the report says, as the nation faces  #8220;outsize challenges #8221; that place congressional shortcomings in stark relief.  #8220;The pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis, #8221; says the report, which grew out of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership.  #8220;But we are also facing another reckoning, one over our nation #8217;s original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding. #8221; The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices. It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems. If the idea of a remote Congress takes hold, the report suggests, it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction.  #8220;Because of the pandemic, Congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually, and we certainly understand why, #8221; the report said.  #8220;But as much as that may have been a necessity, it should not be interpreted as a virtue. #8221; The document says Congress needs  #8220;more and not less in-person interaction among members of Congress. They need to learn more about each other #8217;s districts, hold civil conversations aimed at finding common ground, build relationships of trust that can lead understanding and solutions. #8221; In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true. At its core, the report said that the most important thing lawmakers and leaders of both parties could do was to find ways to promote more communication and understanding across the aisle. It is a longstanding complaint about Congress that with time spent in Washington now deemed a negative, lawmakers just do not interact socially, and consequently find it much easier to dismiss the other side. The disconnect has been exacerbated in recent years as the polarization intensified and Republicans and Democrats now have little contact with one another. The authors say that situation must change if there is any chance for Congress to become more functional.  #8220;Those relationships are the secret sauce for getting things done, understanding each other and building bridges across geography and ideology, #8221; said Mr. Steinhorn. What is school going to look like in September? It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California #8217;s two largest public school districts  #8212; Los Angeles and San Diego  #8212; said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won #8217;t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation #8217;s largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There #8217;s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump warned us this past week: He will not pledge to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election. We should pause to examine the magnitude of this blatant violation of our democratic norms. The head of the executive branch, sworn to uphold the Constitution, which enshrines the process for electing the president and provides for the peaceful transition of power, effectively tells us, Maybe I #8217;ll go along with the results. Maybe not. His comments have not been sufficiently condemned. Trump has already begun to cast doubt on an election that every public national poll and virtually every poll for critical swing states say he is losing, and losing badly. He has repeated the falsehood that voting by mail, which will be used more widely this year than in any previous election in U.S. history, is subject to fraud. The Post #8217;s fact-checking team has repeatedly debunked this assertion. Salvador Rizzo recently explained: - Documented instances of voter fraud are exceedingly rare in the United States, the odds being lower than those of being struck by lightning, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. More than 250 million votes have been cast via mail ballots since 2000, according to the Vote at Home Institute. In 2018, more than 31 million Americans voted by mail, representing one-quarter of election participants. Five states  #8212; Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington  #8212; use mail ballots as the primary method of voting. The percentage of ballots that are even potentially cast fraudulently, rather than as the result of errors, each year is minuscule. As Elise Viebeck explains,  #8220;A Washington Post analysis of data collected by three vote-by-mail states with help from the nonprofit Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) found that officials identified 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people out of about 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, or 0.0025 percent. #8221; The first step in minimizing the chaos that could follow from the 2020 election is shoring up the credibility of the election results, first through a massive effort to inform voters how to register by mail and then through an equally massive effort to debunk Trump #8217;s claim. We should call his falsehood out for what it is: an attempt to invalidate an election he likely will lose. The next step is for every governor, every secretary of state and every state legislative body to pledge publicly to respect the results of the election and to uphold the rules in place for verifying election returns, which differ from state to state. Reporters and ordinary citizens should press governors, state lawmakers and other officials to confirm they will respect the election results and refuse to delay certification of the vote based on spurious accusations. We also need responsible behavior from mainstream media outlets. It is too much to hope that Twitter or Facebook will take down all posts that attempt to suppress the vote, circulate false claims of fraud and spread other misleading information. However, legitimate newspapers and broadcast and cable-news networks should begin well in advance of the election to explain what the process for casting and tabulating votes will look like. They should make absolutely clear that tallying votes may take days or longer to complete in some states given the number of absentee ballots voters are likely to cast. Reporters and pundits alike need to adhere to pre-established rules, strictly enforced by senior management, for  #8220;calling #8221; states. They must avoid providing a false sense of certainty when substantial numbers of votes are still outstanding. They cannot uncritically report on Trump #8217;s claims of fraud. "Without basis, President Trump claims. . . " should be the formulation not,  #8220;Trump says. . . . #8221; or even worse,  #8220;Widespread claims of fraud have been raised. #8221; News outlets should explain that returns from big-city precincts often come in well after less populous rural precincts. And they should disabuse the public of the notion that there is something nefarious if the  #8220;winner #8221; of votes counted and reported on Election Day does not come out ahead after all the votes are tallied. (This happened with numerous House seats in 2018.) None of these measures will prevent Trump, if he is determined, from sowing chaos and attemptingto cast doubt on the results if he loses. Certainly, a blowout election for Democrats would minimize the plausibility of his claims. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on governors, lawmakers, secretaries of state, voting officials, news outlets and ordinary voters to push back against the expected assault on our democratic system. Trump #8217;s disdain for democracy and willingness to destroy every norm  #8212; don #8217;t expect him to concede  #8212; are well known. The best we can do is prepare for his last, desperate attempt to burn the system down."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: " The latest Gallup poll reports that the percentage of Americans identifying as conservative fell from 40 percent in January to 37 percent in March and April as the coronavirus pandemic emerged. From there,  #8220;It fell further to 34% in May and June as the pandemic has worn on, Trump #8217;s job approval rating has tumbled, and the racial justice movement emerged as a national focus following the death of George Floyd. #8221; By contrast, those describing themselves as liberal ticked up from 22 to 26 percent while moderates held roughly even (34 to 36 percent). The drop-off in conservative affiliation is more pronounced among voters older than 35, suburbanites and those making more than $100,000. The poll raises an interesting question beyond the decline in the ideology associated with the Republican Party: What do people think  #8220;conservative #8221; means these days? It is hard to determine who subscribes to something that no one can authoritatively define. One could believe in fiscal discipline, free trade, legal immigration and U.S. leadership in the world (a pre-Trumpian issue-set for many Republicans), or they could buy into the Trumpian view that deficits do not matter, that trade wars are easy to win, that immigrants steal jobs and that the United States has been  #8220;ripped off #8221; in supporting international institutions and alliances such as NATO. Which is the  #8220;conservative #8221; worldview? Self-described conservatives such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) want to deploy troops to U.S. cities without invitation and give "no quarter #8221; to demonstrators. Is this now the  #8220;conservative #8221; definition of  #8220;law and order #8221;? If you listen to President Trump #8217;s apologists, conservatism includes climate change denial or minimization, unchecked executive power and support for a wall (that blows down in a storm or can be sawed through). One can understand why millions of people would not want to be associated with whatever ideology that represents. Trump #8217;s policy positions that follow supply-side economics and hostility to government (tax cuts aimed at the super-rich and corporations and repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a clear alternative) have become wildly unpopular and politically unsustainable. Incumbent Republicans in competitive seats are not running on  #8220;More tax cuts for the rich! #8221; or  #8220;Government shouldn #8217;t guarantee health-care coverage! #8221; Under Trump, the term  #8220;conservative #8221; has become almost meaningless, in large part because the party that identifies with conservatism has become a cult of personality extolling whatever position Trump latches upon, no matter how incoherent or repulsive. Good  #8220;conservatives #8221; are supposed to believe that family separation is an acceptable border policy, that the Justice Department should serve the president #8217;s political interests and that developing a nationwide testing and tracing program is the responsibility of states, not the federal government (although the feds #8217; exercise of the police power is necessary).  #8220;Conservatism #8221; now is a chaotic blend of right-wing nationalism, conspiracy theories, plutocratic economics, cronyism, protectionism, realpolitik foreign policy and repudiation of objective reality. When Trump departs, it is far from clear whether it will remain so, revert to pure anti-government libertarianism (which has a small constituency aside from donors and hard-line activists) or morph into something else entirely. Trump apologists like to accuse Never Trumpers of no longer being conservatives. The best answer is:  #8220;If Trumpism is conservatism, I #8217;m not conservative  #8212; and good riddance. Now define conservatism."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Republicans remain so tightly bubble-wrapped in their right-wing world that they seem incapable of evaluating how they come across to average Americans. President No-I-Won #8217;t-Honor-John-Lewis is the main problem. His administration is now being sued by mothers. No, really. The Post reports: - A group of five women and two organizations, including longtime Black Lives Matter protesters and the yellow-clad Wall of Moms group that assembles nightly to stand between protesters and federal law enforcement officers, filed a lawsuit alleging that several agencies  #8212; the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Protective Service  #8212; have violated their constitutional rights of free speech, assembly and due process and against unreasonable seizures. President Trump plans on sending more troops to Portland. The president is not the sole culprit in the attempt to alienate large chunks of the electorate. On Monday afternoon, Senate Republicans introduced their stimulus bill, which would take money away from unemployed people (perhaps  #8220;anti-stimulus #8221; bill is more appropriate). In their misbegotten belief that giving a whole $600 per week subsidy to unemployed people (in a time of record joblessness) only induces them to goof off, Republicans proposed cutting it back to $200. There is zero evidence for their miserliness. Yale University released a study on Monday: - The report found that workers receiving larger increases in unemployment benefits experienced very similar gains in employment by early May relative to workers with less-generous benefit increases. People with more generously expanded benefits also resumed working at a similar or slightly quicker rate than others did, according to the report. -  #8220;The data do not show a relationship between benefit generosity and employment paths after the CARES Act, which could be due to the collapse of labor demand during the COVID-19 crisis, #8221; said Joseph Altonji, the Thomas DeWitt Cuyler Professor of Economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and a co-author of the report. But don #8217;t bother Republicans with the facts. They #8217;re more concerned with looking like puppets of corporate America, adding into their package a new deduction for business lunches and entertainment as well as immunity from suits from employee who come back to work. In other words, Republicans cut the subsidy for unemployed waiters but gave a tax break to employers who get their meals delivered by essential workers, who, if they get sick, have no recourse against their employers. To make matters even more unseemly, the provision also includes a provision to force the FBI to build its new headquarters in Washington  #8212; a pet project for the president whose hotel is kitty-corner from the current location, which is widely regarded as an eyesore. The proposal from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has zero chance of becoming law, or even getting a vote. McConnell did not even go over to the House to start negotiations; that task was left to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (who has successfully struck deals with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on previous coronavirus recovery packages). The Republican bill contained no new money (aside from funding for schools) for states and localities  #8212; run by leaders of both parties  #8212; that have been financially walloped by the combination of lost revenue and extraordinary expenses in fighting the pandemic. Without additional money, reams of state and local employees including firefighters, police, EMTs and health-care workers may face layoffs. The bipartisan National Governors Association, in a letter co-signed by Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland (R) and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York (D), the associations chair and vice chair respectively, pleaded last week for at least  #8220;$500 billion in unrestricted assistance, and an increase of Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) to 12 percent. #8221; In short, the bill is not only a political nonstarter; it is rotten politics for Republicans who (thanks to the $2-trillion tax cut and attempts to take away the Affordable Care Act) have lived up to the caricature of being pawns of millionaires and billionaires with little conception of the needs of struggling Americans. Should there be a lapse in benefits or in the eviction moratorium, there is little doubt who will be held responsible. For already endangered Senate Republican incumbents, McConnell #8217;s package makes their reelection fights even tougher."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The lies, outrageous positions and fear-mongering spewed by President Trump and his enablers might be infuriating, but just keep in mind they are politically counterproductive. Forget about the reckless governance, which is a lost cause. Be outraged, but also comforted that Republicans #8217; political pratfalls are making it more likely that voters will boot them out. Trump #8217;s facade of normalcy crumbled entirely on Tuesday when he whined that his administration #8217;s public health officials, Anthony S. Fauci and Deborah Birx, had better approval ratings than he.  #8220;It can only be my personality, that #8217;s all," he said without irony. Well, that and nearly 150,000 dead Americans. There #8217;s also his hawking of dangerous remedies. On Tuesday, he continued beating the drum for hydroxychloroquine and to tout a discredited doctor who peddles the antimalarial drug, says masks are not needed and believes that alien DNA is used in modern medicine. Trump also falsely insisted large parts of the country are free of coronavirus. Here was Trump at his worst  #8212; self-pitying, ignorant, irrational and utterly unaware how he comes across to those outside his cult. What #8217;s more, he unwittingly confirmed how easily right-wing media characters lead him around by the nose  #8212; no matter how absurd and unfounded their claims. Meanwhile, he seethes with resentment toward actual experts who continue to present accurate  #8212; but politically unhelpful  #8212; evidence of his failure to combat the pandemic. In the Trump enablers category, no one compares to Attorney General William P. Barr in his willingness to throw caution, facts and manners to the wind to defend his boss. His bristling testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday was quintessential Barr. He hesitated to definitively say that soliciting help from a foreign government is inappropriate (he had to be asked twice) and claimed his intervention for a lighter sentence for Trump confidant Roger Stone was appropriate. He declared that law enforcement should be able to arrest and use tear gas against peaceful protesters to restore  #8220;order. #8221; He suggested it is legal to throw someone in an unmarked car without probable cause. (It isn #8217;t.) Barr might deny the existence of systemic racism, but he cannot account for why federal agents were deployed to Portland to squelch Black Lives Matter protesters and not to Michigan, where MAGA forces charged a statehouse, got in officers #8217; faces and threatened the governor. Asked about disagreeable facts or evidence of unfair treatment, he claimed not to be aware of such information  #8212; ironically demonstrating how partisan law enforcement harbors implicit bias and fails to equally apply the law through willful ignorance. Within hours of his testimony painting a picture of utter chaos in Portland, the city #8217;s mayor announced federal agents had left. Maybe Barr was once again simply spewing campaign-type rhetoric in service of his boss? If his effort was to convey Trump as a  #8220;law and order #8221; candidate, the hysterical testimony was a flop. Even if Barr would not retreat, the federal forces did. Even more noteworthy, poll after poll shows that Trump and Barr are entirely out of tune with public opinion, which sides strongly with protesters seeking racial justice. A Gallup poll released Tuesday reports: - About two in three Americans (65%) support the nationwide protests about racial injustice that followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May. Half say they feel  #8220;very #8221; (23%) or  #8220;somewhat connected #8221; (27%) to the protests #8217; cause. ... - Americans are more likely to say the protests  #8220;will help #8221; (53%) rather than  #8220;hurt #8221; (34%) public support for racial justice and equality, while 13% say they will  #8220;make no difference. #8221; Republicans are the exception to these trends, but even 22 percent of them side with the racial justice activists. In other words, Barr is dishonestly hawking Trump #8217;s phony  #8220;law and order #8221; message to no avail. Barr #8217;s testimony was punctuated by the usual histrionics from Republican congressmen. Ranking minority-party member and conspiracy monger Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) felt compelled to share a mash-up video of violent scenes of protests. Meant to convey that we need Trump to keep the peace, it did the opposite: This is what America looks like under Trump. Democrats might want to feature Jordan in their ads: Is this the party you want in charge? That brings us to Republican senators, who seemed determined to put out the most unattractive and politically disastrous stimulus possible. The bill includes $1.75 billion for a new FBI building across from Trump #8217;s hotel, but no eviction moratorium. It knocks down federal support for unemployment insurance, but throws in a new deduction for business meals and entertainment. It includes liability immunity for businesses, but no money for state and local governments to prevent mass layoffs. You would be hard-pressed to come up with something that would better highlight their disdain for working people, docility in the face of Trump #8217;s self-dealing and capitulation to corporate interests. The final blow was delivered by none other than Trump. In a singular moment of clarity, he declared the proposal  #8220;sort of semi-irrelevant." If there is to be a deal, it will have to be worked out between the House and White House. So what purpose are Senate Republicans serving here? The next Democratic ad might rightly ask why  #8220;sort of semi-irrelevant #8221; lawmakers should be in the majority. Neither Trump nor Barr nor Republicans in Congress have a clue what the public wants or how they come across outside the right-wing media bubble. They remain stubbornly divorced from reality and temperamentally unfit for the serious task of governance. In less than 100 days, voters have the chance to drive them from office and return sane, stable characters to government."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It should now be clear to everyone: The Republican Party is incapable of governing. Sure, this sounds partisan. In fact, it #8217;s an analytical reflection based on what is happening right before our eyes. You would think that with our nation facing its most profound economic crisis since the 1930s, married to a public health disaster and growing unrest over racial injustice, the party that controls the White House and the U.S. Senate would get serious. Instead, the Senate #8217;s Republican majority and the Trump White House are in chaos, unable to produce a coherent relief bill to keep the economy from spiraling further downward. Republicans admit this.  #8220;It #8217;s a mess, #8221; said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) of the party #8217;s own ramshackle proposal.  #8220;I can #8217;t figure out what this bill #8217;s about. #8221; A telltale sign of the Republicans #8217; flight from responsibility is that they waited until the last minute before launching their haphazard scramble because they were hoping to avoid having to do anything. The Democratic House passed a $3 trillion relief bill on May 15. Did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) spend the intervening 10 weeks pulling his troops together for the inevitable counterproposal? No. Republicans offered pipe dreams that maybe covid-19 would abate, maybe the economy would come roaring back on its own . #8201;. #8201;. maybe, maybe, maybe. The jockeying for the post-Trump future of the Republican Party has started, says Post columnist Max Boot. (Video: Joy Sharon Yi, Kate Woodsome/Photo: Johnathan Newton/Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) The truth is that the GOP simply hates the idea that Washington should have a big role to play when catastrophe strikes. The GOP never much liked the first rescue packages, strongly shaped by Democrats, even though they helped President Trump #8217;s economic ratings when his poll numbers sagged everywhere else.  #8220;Simply shoveling cash from Washington is not going to solve the problem, #8221; said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Except that in a situation like this, shoveling cash from Washington is exactly what #8217;s required to solve the problem. Absent help, unemployed people don #8217;t have money to spend, state and local budgets wallow in red ink, health systems are overburdened, hunger rises  #8212; and that #8217;s just a sampling of tribulations that can #8217;t be eased without robust federal intervention. You also sense that some Republicans have already concluded that Trump will lose and are preparing themselves for the post-election recriminations  #8212; and never mind the damage that will be done to the economy and people #8217;s lives in the meantime. Thus did Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) declare that negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were  #8220;about Democrats and Trumpers competing to outspend each other. #8221; Neat trick: Oppose Trump for being some kind of profligate leftist. For his part, Trump described the Senate GOP plan as  #8220;sort of semi-irrelevant. #8221; Not that Trump is helping things. The administration #8217;s insistence on slipping into the Senate bill an entirely irrelevant $1.75 billion for a new FBI building is just the latest indication that the president #8217;s only real interest in government relates to how it can serve his private interests. Executives of the Trump International Hotel down the street have raised fears that the family business would be hurt if the FBI followed an alternative plan to move to the suburbs and demolished the current structure. A developer might well use the existing site to build a competing hostelry. Can #8217;t have that. The Republican implosion has been a long time coming, and its causes have been documented over many years. In 2012, the political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein, historically respectful of both parties, concluded that the GOP had become  #8220;ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. #8221; (Disclosure: They #8217;re friends and sometime co-authors, but you can #8217;t write on this subject without citing their brave early protest.) This year, MSNBC producer Steve Benen persuasively chronicled how Republicans had become a  #8220;post-policy #8221; party in his book whose title brings home his point:  #8220;The Impostors: How Republicans Quit Governing and Seized American Politics. #8221; And in  #8220;Is the Republican Party Destroying Itself?, #8221; also published this year, Harvard professor Thomas E. Patterson points to the GOP #8217;s narrowing demographic and ideological base, its dependence on right-wing media and monied interests, and its  #8220;disregard for democratic norms and institutions. #8221; (See: Attorney General William P. Barr #8217;s testimony on Tuesday.) Having skipped their homework, having spread the coronavirus with a spring break fantasy that bars and restaurants and everything else could open wide, Republicans had the nerve on Wednesday to ask for an extension. Pass a  #8220;skinny #8221; bill extending some unemployment insurance provisions and a rent moratorium (without, of course, helping renters pay the rent). Sorry, but you reach a point when political parties, like wayward students, must be given an F. I hope Republicans will be ready to govern again someday. Right now, the party has earned itself only a multi-year expulsion."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump #8217;s critics have a remarkable capacity to predict the future. Consider all the things Trump #8217;s fiercest critics, both Democrats and Never Trumpers, called in advance: - If Trump goads governors into reopening their states early and sneer at mask-wearing, thousands will die. - If Trump fears he will lose the election, he will try to delegitimize the election. - If Trump stops inciting violent clashes with federal forces, unrest will die down. - If the virus runs rampant, the economy cannot recover. - If you go to a crowded Trump rally where masks are not worn, you risk illness or death. - If Trump sides with white nationalists and not Black Lives Matter, he will be at odds with with most Americans. - If Trump disdains scientific expertise, he will make a fool of himself embracing quack remedies and charlatans. It is not that Trump critics have a crystal ball. If you understand cause and effect, embrace science and exercise common sense, you too can anticipate a good deal. If you do not disregard every public poll showing you doing poorly, you might have a better sense of where Americans actually stand on issues. (It would help if you got out of the right-wing media playback loop.) Trump, however, is unable to do these things and flails away, making matters worse for himself and the country. We might try a different approach that would allow Trump also to  #8220;predict #8221; the future. Here it goes: - If you invest in absentee voting and give the U.S. Postal Service adequate funds, you will help avoid, as Trump put it on Friday, the  #8220;greatest election disaster in history. #8221; - If you call out Russian President Vladimir Putin for targeting U.S. troops and impose harsh sanctions when he does, he (and other aggressors) will be more likely to stop than if you never bring it up. - If you want Americans to survive financially and pay their bills at a time of astronomically high unemployment, boost their unemployment insurance, expand food stamps and give state and local governments money to stop massive layoffs of public employees. This is not rocket science. At some point it becomes obvious that Trump does not want to do these things. He does not want to add credibility to an election he is increasingly likely to lose. He does not want to confront Putin even if U.S. troops #8217; lives are at stake. And he does not want to help working people because it will not impress his donors and will not keep him in good stead with the extreme base. (On this last one, it is also possible he and millionaire Cabinet members simply have no clue about the concerns facing unemployed Americans, who are not lazy but rather unable to find jobs.) Republicans in 2016 missed the easiest cause and effect out there: If you elect a narcissistic, ignorant, corrupt and cruel president, disaster will ensue. We now are paying the price."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "With each passing day, Republicans #8217; approach to extending economic aid looks lazier. From the day President Trump signed the Cares Act into law, politicians had months to craft a follow-up for that bill #8217;s expiration. That time was sorely needed: In Washington, neither intraparty debates nor Democrat-Republican negotiations are quick. But while Democrats settled on their bill by mid-May, more than two months ago, Republicans dawdled right up to the deadline. The GOP #8217;s sloth screams disinterest in the hard work of governing  #8212; and that disinterest starts at the top. The result is now the spectacle of Republicans trying to shame Democrats for blocking something Republicans oppose. On CBS #8217;s  #8220;Face the Nation, #8221; White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said,  #8220;if you have unemployed people that have lost their enhanced unemployment, they need to call their Democrat senators and House members because they are the ones that are standing in the way of having those extended right now. #8221; He left out that said extension would be only for one week, that Democrats opposed the one-week extension because they wanted it to be far longer and that Republicans ultimately want to slash that  #8220;enhanced unemployment #8221;  #8212; a weekly payment above traditional unemployment coverage that was part of the Cares Act  #8212; from $600 to $200 a week. But that #8217;s the pretzel logic the GOP is stuck with because it put off the policy work. In fact, Republicans haven #8217;t even hashed out the divides in their own caucus. When CBS #8217;s John Dickerson asked about  #8220;heartburn #8221; over another round of pandemic relief among some deficit-conscious Republicans, Meadows could only manage a feeble  #8220;yeah #8221; before pivoting back to the temporary benefit extension. And when ABC #8217;s Martha Raddatz asked for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to react to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell #8217;s comments that 15 to 20 GOP senators still won #8217;t vote for any coronavirus deal, Mnuchin lamely assured viewers that  #8220;Mark Meadows and I have been updating the president regularly. #8221; Had Republicans gotten to work months ago, this disastrous lapse in relief could have been avoided. But when the party #8217;s leader has as much interest in policy details as a dog has in vegetables, why should we expect anything different? If Meadows and Mnuchin have indeed been  #8220;updating the president regularly, #8221; he #8217;s not listening. On Saturday, in between retweeting slavish praise and Fox News clips, Trump tweeted,  #8220;Payroll Tax Cut plus Dollars! #8221; What  #8220;plus Dollars #8221; means is unclear, but the other part is not: The president remains obsessed with a payroll tax cut no one else is talking about, not even his own team. There are good policy reasons for this: With millions out of work, a payroll tax cut would be a particularly poorly designed stimulus. Nonetheless, Trump has pushed the idea repeatedly, and going into the intraparty negotiations, the administration insisted the Republican bill include a payroll tax cut. But like so many Trump White House  #8220;demands, #8221; it was hot air: The GOP #8217;s proposal, unveiled July 27, included no payroll tax cut. Even as millions of Americans wait for desperately needed relief, the president is so out of touch that he #8217;s the last person in Washington to know that his supposed priority was ditched by his own party days ago. No doubt many would argue that it #8217;s for the best that Trump isn #8217;t involved in policymaking. But the fact that the question is up for debate at all is terrible for the country. The only small comfort is that, after almost four long years, this nightmare may finally be coming to an end."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "As we draw to a close of President Trump #8217;s first (and last, we hope) term, the mainstream media #8217;s performance in TV interviews has been largely disappointing. (Disclosure: I am an MSNBC contributor). Fox News #8217;s Chris Wallace, who grilled Trump last month, was the rare exception to poorly phrased questions and lack of follow-up. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted on Sunday that the $600 per week in supplemental unemployment insurance disincentivized people to look for work. ABC News #8217;s Martha Raddatz came prepared, but ultimately Mnuchin skated by: - RADDATZ: So  #8212; so you do think it is a disincentive to find a job if you have that extra $600? - MNUCHIN: There #8217;s no question in certain cases where we #8217;re paying people more to work  #8212; stay home than to work. That #8217;s created issues in the entire economy. - But let me just say, you have to look at all these things  #8212; - RADDATZ: I want to  #8212; I want to interrupt you there for just one second. You  #8212; it #8217;s not all the evidence. A Yale study from this month refutes that, saying many economists who have studied the benefits said that so far they don #8217;t see any evidence in labor market data that the payments are affecting at which people are returning to work during the pandemic. - MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say, I went to Yale. - RADDATZ: I know that. - MNUCHIN: I agree on certain things. I don #8217;t always agree. There #8217;s a [University of Chicago] study that goes through all the people that are overpaid. The moment cried out for more pointed questions: Did the Chicago study show an actual disincentive to work? (Hint: No.) Here is a multimillionaire telling us that the head of a family scraping by on, say, $900 a week in state and federal benefits is overpaid. Is someone collecting that amount really making too much money? Deborah Birx, response coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, admits we are in a much worse position now than in March and April. Isn #8217;t this Trump #8217;s fault? We did not get a chance to hear the answer to the question on everyone #8217;s mind in an interview with CNN #8217;s Dana Bash on Sunday: - BASH: So, Dr. Birx, you #8217;re explaining what happened. The question that everybody out there has is, why? Why did this happen? Why was the government, particularly  #8212; I mean, you #8217;re the coordinator for the federal response. Why weren #8217;t you able to  #8212; to stop this from spreading and continuing to spread uncontrollably, as it is now? - BIRX: So, what I have learned in working with epidemics around the globe is, you have to really get down to the level of where the epidemic is. ... I can tell you, across America right now, people are on the move. And so all of our discussions about social distancing and decreasing gatherings to under 10, as I traveled around the country, I saw all of America moving. ... - BASH: Dr. Birx, before we move on to some specifics, I just want to really try to get a handle on this, because what I'm trying to express to you, which is something that I know that you're hearing, people are panicked. People are worried. People don't understand why this is seeming to be completely out of control. - Johns Hopkins University said  #8212; quote  #8212; this week:  #8220;The United States is not currently on course to get control of the epidemic. It #8217;s time to reset. #8221; A couple of other medical agencies, associations said similar. - So, is it time for the federal government to reset? - BIRX: Well, I think the federal government reset about five to six weeks ago, when we saw this starting to happen across the South. Really, we reset? Administration figures routinely make unsubstantiated claims that voting by mail is open to massive fraud. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on CBS News #8217;s  #8220;Face the Nation #8221; did exactly that on Sunday, attempting to make the spurious distinction between absentee ballots and voting by mail. Every interviewer has an obligation to zero in on a disingenuous charge aimed to discredit the election. In every interview, it is essential to pin down the president or his representative and force them to answer questions such as these: - The death rate and infection rate are soaring. Why does the president falsely say there are merely "hot spots #8221; and continue to make the repeatedly debunked claim that we have more cases because we test more? - Administration officials repeatedly have said the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is not a remedy for the coronavirus. (Administration testing chief Brett Giroir said it again on Sunday). Why does the president continue to hawk an ineffective and possibly dangerous remedy? - Trump urged states to reopen early, and now many of them are experiencing the worst surges, as Anthony S. Fauci, the nation #8217;s top infectious-disease expert, has said. Was it wrong to goad states this way? Did Trump endanger Americans? - Explain the difference between absentee voting, in use at least since the Civil War, and voting by mail. There is zero evidence that voting by mail is an invitation to fraud. Why does the president keep saying this? - How can you call a wrecked economy and more than 150,000 dead Americans a  #8220;success #8221;? When he or she hedges and deflects, the interviewer has to point out that the Trump official or right-wing sycophant is not responding. Ask it a second time  #8212; or a third. Letting the administration flacks off the hook to race to another topic (where the interviewer does not pin the official down either) does a disservice to the American people. There are some skilled interviewers out there in addition to Wallace. ABC News #8217;s George Stephanopoulos in June 2019 did an expert job pinning down Trump on his willingness to use foreign help to win an election. CNN #8217;s Jake Tapper routinely corners administration officials and members of Congress. Other interviewers must be willing to create awkward and uncomfortable exchanges; it is not their job to put the guest at ease. They should not care if the guest refuses to return. Interviewers #8217; job is to get at the truth and expose those concealing it. So far, few have mastered the task."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Manhattan district attorney #8217;s office suggested on Monday that it has been investigating President Trump and his company for possible bank and insurance fraud, a significantly broader inquiry than the prosecutors have acknowledged in the past. The office of the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., made the disclosure in a new federal court filing arguing Mr. Trump #8217;s accountants should have to comply with its subpoena seeking eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. Mr. Trump has asked a judge to declare the subpoena invalid. The prosecutors did not directly identify the focus of their inquiry but said that  #8220;undisputed #8221; news reports last year about Mr. Trump #8217;s business practices make it clear that the office had a legal basis for the subpoena. The reports, including investigations into the president #8217;s wealth and an article on the congressional testimony of his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, said that the president may have illegally inflated his net worth and the value of his properties to lenders and insurers. Lawyers for Mr. Trump have said he did nothing wrong. The clash over the subpoena comes less than a month after the Supreme Court, in a major ruling on the limits of presidential power, cleared the way for Mr. Vance #8217;s prosecutors to seek Mr. Trump #8217;s financial records. The filing from prosecutors came in response to an argument Mr. Trump made last week, calling the subpoena from Mr. Vance, a Democrat,  #8220;wildly overbroad #8221; and issued in bad faith. Mr. Vance #8217;s office subpoenaed Mr. Trump #8217;s accounting firm, Mazars USA, in August 2019 for the tax returns as part of its investigation, which until now was believed to be focused on hush-money payments made to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, including the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen arranged the payments to Ms. Daniels and the other woman, Karen McDougal. Mr. Vance #8217;s office has been looking into whether any New York State laws were broken when those payments were made. Mr. Trump has fought the subpoena for almost a year, at first arguing that as a sitting president, he was immune from state criminal investigation. Mr. Trump #8217;s position was soundly rejected by the Supreme Court last month, but it said he could return to the lower court in Manhattan, where he first sued to block the subpoena, and raise new arguments. In a recent hearing, Mr. Vance #8217;s office told the judge, Victor Marrero of Federal District Court, that Mr. Trump was just dragging out the legal fight in order to effectively shield himself from criminal investigation.  #8220;What the president #8217;s lawyers are seeking here is delay, #8221; Carey R. Dunne, a lawyer in Mr. Vance #8217;s office, told Judge Marrero. Mr. Dunne said that the longer Mr. Trump fought the case, the greater the chance that the statute of limitations would expire for any potential crimes that might have been committed, effectively granting the president immunity.  #8220;Let #8217;s not let delay kill this case, #8221; Mr. Dunne argued. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, denied after the hearing that Mr. Trump #8217;s lawyers were pursing a strategy of delay.  #8220;Our strategy seeks due process, #8221; Mr. Sekulow said in an email at the time. Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations for his role in the payments, is serving a three-year prison sentence in home confinement in his apartment in Manhattan. If Mr. Vance succeeds in eventually obtaining Mr. Trump #8217;s records, they are unlikely to become public anytime soon because they will be shielded by grand jury secrecy rules. The records might only emerge later if criminal charges are brought and the records are introduced in a trial."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Senate map has ballooned for Democrats, giving them a chance to take states once thought unlikely to flip (e.g., Iowa and Montana) and leaving them with only one Democratic incumbent, Doug Jones of Alabama, in peril. If anti-immigrant provocateur Kris Kobach wins the Senate Republican primary in Kansas on Tuesday, Democrats will have a shot in a state that last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1932. Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) is now in deep trouble; Cook Political Report has shifted her seat to  #8220;Lean Democrat. #8221; Other incumbent Republicans are in similar straits, including Thom Tillis of North Carolina (down 9.5 points according to RealClearPolitics), Susan Collins of Maine (down 4.5 points) and Cory Gardner of Colorado (down 13 points). CNN reports that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  #8220;has signaled to vulnerable GOP senators in tough races that they could distance themselves from the President if they feel it is necessary, according to multiple senior Republicans including a source close to McConnell. #8221; The extent of their latitude is unclear, however. ( #8220;These vulnerable senators can #8217;t afford to explicitly repudiate Trump, #8221; a senior unnamed Republican in Congress told CNN.  #8220;They just need to show they are independent on issues important in their states. #8221;) You wonder how that is going to work when they get asked questions such as these: - Are you supporting the lawsuit to take away all Obamacare protections for people with preexisting conditions? If not, what have you done about it? - Couldn #8217;t we have avoided Trump #8217;s bungling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 150,000 people in the United States, if you voted to impeach him? - Isn #8217;t refusal to confront Russia on bounties for killing U.S. troops a betrayal of our men and women serving overseas? If you had removed the president for betraying our national security regarding Ukraine, he wouldn #8217;t be repeating that pattern now, would he? Do you regret your vote? - You voted for a $2 trillion tax cut on the promise it would pay for itself. It didn #8217;t come close. Should we reverse it? How can you then oppose spending a similar amount on support for unemployed Americans, state and local governments, and voting by mail? - Will you denounce attempts to undermine mail-in voting? Will you pledge to recognize the results of the election and rebut efforts to delegitimize it? - Has the administration  #8220;succeeded #8221; in fighting the coronavirus? Why haven #8217;t you insisted on a national testing and tracing program? - Was it appropriate to send without the permission of the governor unidentified federal forces to gas and attack protesters in Portland, Ore.? What did you do about it? - Why did you vote to confirm Cabinet officials such as Scott Pruitt for the Environmental Protection Agency (only Collins voted against him), Tom Price for the Department of Health and Human Services, Ryan Zinke for the Interior Department and Alexander Acosta for the Labor Department  #8212; all of whom left office under the cloud of ethics violations (including Acosta, for his participation in Jeffrey Epstein #8217;s plea deal)? - Is the economy in better or worse shape in January 2015, when your term began? - When have you condemned Trump #8217;s racist rhetoric? - Have we  #8220;won #8221; the trade war against China? If not, why haven #8217;t you reclaimed Congress #8217;s power over tariffs? - What reason do voters have to believe you would stand up to Trump if he is reelected? If Republicans cannot answer these questions and prove they really have separated themselves from Trump, then McConnell #8217;s advice is fanciful."</TEXT>

Even when justified on the merits, it opens the door to retribution by the other side and the criminalization of politics. Moreover, when the country is as polarized as the United States is now, a criminal trial would surely inflame emotions and make the country practically ungovernable. And, as we learned during the Mueller investigation and impeachment, it can be difficult to assemble evidence for actions the president took in office because of executive privilege (the qualified one as opposed to the bogus  #8220;absolute #8221; privilege the Supreme Court shot down in July). However, state prosecution for actions that precede a presidency avoids these pitfalls. And that may well be where we are headed with President Trump. The New York Times reports:  #8220;The Manhattan district attorney #8217;s office suggested on Monday that it has been investigating President Trump and his company for possible bank and insurance fraud, a significantly broader inquiry than the prosecutors have acknowledged in the past. #8221; This is the same investigation which Trump unsuccessfully attempted to thwart by invocation of absolute immunity. District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., in a filing to justify the broad scope of the subpoena, let on that the scope of the investigation is correspondingly broad. This is not merely about hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, to keep them quiet about alleged affairs with Trump; the matter could potentially cover years of financial dealings. The Times explains that prosecutors  #8220;cited newspaper investigations that concluded the president may have illegally inflated his net worth and the value of his properties to lenders and insurers. . . [and] an article on the congressional testimony of his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who told lawmakers last year that the president had committed insurance fraud. #8221; Trump denies all wrongdoing (and has assiduously hidden his taxes from view), but a grand jury continues to investigate. The filing should send panic rushing through the Trump empire.  #8220;The serious state crimes by Donald Trump and his enterprises that Cyrus Vance has indicated he is pursuing as Manhattan DA cannot be shielded from prosecution by any invocation of presidential immunity, nor are they beyond the reach of prosecution and punishment by virtue of time, #8221; constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tells me.  #8220;The ongoing pattern of financial fraud and deception quite plausibly establishes an inseparable criminal scheme that prevents the statute of limitations from taking even the earliest instances of felonious conduct by Trump and his co-conspirators off the table. #8221; On the issue of the statute of limitations, former House impeachment counsel Norman Eisen says,  #8220;Statutes of limitation can be held open by a variety of circumstances, such as ongoing conspiracies, concealment and other equitable considerations, although that is not easy to do. #8221; He adds,  #8220;Still, if the evidence, for example, demonstrates a single continuous fraud by Trump, it might or might not overcome the normal time limits for prosecution. #8221; As of now, of course, no indictment has come, and Trump enjoys the presumption of innocence. The grand jury #8217;s work is secret, so we do not know if it is at its beginning, middle or the end.  #8220;The question of whether to indict before Election Day  #8212; if it is even logistically possible  #8212; is an agonizing one. It will be viewed as politicizing the prosecution and criminalizing the election, #8221; cautions Eisen.  #8220;If the prosecutors are in fact ready to go, better to do so after the election is settled. #8221; He adds:  #8220;Whatever they do, the good news is that if they decide to prosecute, a presidential self-pardon won #8217;t work both because it is unconstitutional and because federal pardons don #8217;t apply to state offenses like these. #8221; A few points deserve emphasis: First, this news undercuts the notion perpetrated after the Supreme Court #8217;s ruling that it was a partial victory for Trump. Vance will almost certainly get his evidence, and the timeline may be far shorter than some commentators fear. Second, we do not need nor should we want this to be the decisive issue in the election; Trump likely faces a broad repudiation by voters, which is highly preferable to an indictment before the election that Trump could blame for his loss. Finally, the genius of a federal system and an independent judiciary as a block against an executive seeking authoritarian powers has never been more evident  #8212; or appreciated."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump, apparently recognizing he is losing, wants to schedule a fourth debate with former vice president Joe Biden in early September so voters casting ballots super early will see his performance. (Be careful what you wish for.) He submitted to the presidential debate commission an unintentionally revealing and damning list of proposed moderators. Needless to say, ABC #8217;s George Stephanopoulos (who tripped him up on receiving foreign assistance), Axios #8217;s Jonathan Swan (who gave a seminar in taking down a compulsive liar), Fox News #8217;s Chris Wallace (who, among other things, took Trump to task for boasting about passing a cognitive assessment test) and CNN #8217;s Jake Tapper (who has skewered many apologists) were not on the list. Do not worry. The commission, not the candidates, chooses the moderators, and then tend toward serious, competent people. (NBC #8217;s Lester Holt, CNN #8217;s Anderson Cooper, PBS #8217;s Jim Lehrer and CBS #8217;s Bob Schieffer are some of the recent choices.) I cannot imagine the commission selecting someone Trump has signaled would go soft on him. (Frank Fahrenkopf, who co-heads the commission, did not respond to questions about the letter.) Biden has no reason to grant the struggling president an opportunity for attention, although judging from Trump #8217;s recent experiences with Wallace and Swan, the more Trump the better for Biden, I would say. Nevertheless, aside from moderator-selection, there is good reason to make important changes to presidential debates. Some of these are within the commission #8217;s control, others fall under the moderators #8217; purview, and some are the responsibility of the media that broadcast the events. First, the debates feature too many questions and too many topics, allowing ill-informed and filibustering participants to skate by. Given the calamities we face, I would suggest one debate on the coronavirus, one on the economy and one on racial justice. Even as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases passes 3 million, President Trump has repeatedly played down covid-19 #8217;s toll on the country. (Video: Joy Sharon Yi, Danielle Kunitz/Photo: Jonathan Newton / Washington Post/The Washington Post) Second, while the candidates should not have to count backward by seven or distinguish an elephant from a lion  #8212; as included in the cognitive assessment that President Trump took  #8212; there should be at least some questions designed to probe whether the candidate is  #8220;with it. #8221; How is NATO funded? What did the 1965 Voting Rights Act do, and how did the Supreme Court alter it? Third, eliminating the audience will reduce the circus value and the tired shtick concerning invited guests. Likewise, we can do without opening and closing speeches that use up time and are prepared by aides. We get enough canned answers in the answers to questions. Fourth, some have suggested the release of taxes or health records as a requirement for entry. That gatekeeper function strikes me as properly the job of Congress and political parties. Nevertheless, especially for candidates who have not released information, the moderator needs to drill down on sensitive topics. Why did you go to Walter Reed hospital, Mr. President? Why did the doctor administer a cognitive exam? How many times did you take one? You are under investigation for financial crimes by the state of New York. How do voters know their president is not a crook? Fifth, real-time fact-checking is needed, either by a moderator willing to interrupt candidates or by broadcasters on a split screen. Putting a fact-checker next to the moderator (might I recommend The Post #8217;s Glenn Kessler and CNN #8217;s David Dale?) and allowing a participant to request a limited number of fact checks (such as video review in sports) would be eye-opening, I suspect. It is not clear that debates make much difference in presidential races, but they can be informative and exacting. We surely could use a tougher rite of passage for the presidential contenders."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT:: "In the midst of President Trump #8217;s appalling failure to confront the novel coronavirus, the ensuing collapse of the economy and loss of respect and influence around the world, we should not lose track of the administration #8217;s serial foreign policy failures and the degree to which Republicans enabled actions they deplored under President Barack Obama. The resignation of Brian Hook  #8212; the U.S. special envoy to Iran who championed the ill-conceived view that if we unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we would gain a stronger hand with Iran  #8212; reminds us of that colossal flop. The administration withdrew from the deal, insisting that our allies would follow suit (they did not), that increased pressure on Iran would bring it to the negotiating table (it did not), and that we would continue to reap the benefits of the JCPOA, namely limits on Tehran #8217;s nuclear weapons program (we did not). At every stage in the  #8220;policy," which was more a political impulse than a thought-out alternative policy, the administration refused to acknowledge that while the JCPOA had flaws (e.g., regarding missile testing), we could have addressed them within the framework of the deal and keep our allies on board. Instead, the ideological and personal insistence on ripping up  #8220;Obama #8217;s deal #8221; overrode common sense. (Those who could not fathom why some of us who opposed the JCPOA when implemented should now understand why we dreaded getting rid of it. We never had a better alternative.) By any measure, we are in a worse position now than we were four years ago regarding Iran, which continues to fund terrorist groups and destabilize the region. And where on the planet have we improved our position? Not with North Korea, whose dictator was rewarded with public relations bonanzas in exchange for nothing. After the United States halted some military exercises with South Korea, North Korea #8217;s nuclear program continues, our allies have learned not to trust us and North Korea #8217;s human rights atrocities have not abated. (Indeed, Trump humanized and excused Kim Jong Un #8217;s rule of terror.) Meanwhile, never has a Russian leader gotten so much from the United States for so little. Russian President Vladimir Putin put bounties on the heads of U.S. troops. No response. He reaped the benefits of an ill-conceived withdrawal from Syria, a betrayal of our Kurdish allies. He has watched with glee as the United States unilaterally planned to pull thousands of troops from Germany. Trump publicly took Russia #8217;s side over intelligence experts regarding Russian interference in our election  #8212; and consequently never took defense of our election systems seriously. Trump continually undermines and whines about the NATO alliance. He was ready to throw Ukraine to the Russian bear  #8212; and betrayed national security  #8212; to help his reelection chances. And Republicans, rather than remove him, mouthed Russian propaganda. Any Cold Warrior who would defend that record has lost their soul. China? The trade war was not quick and was not won. Our farmers, consumers and businesses still pay the price of the tariff war while the West finds China continuing its effort to steal intellectual property and commit atrocities against the Uighurs. (Trump reportedly condoned the building of detention camps for the minority group.) China also extended its international influence as we recede from international bodies (e.g., the World Health Organization) and agreements (the Trans-Pacific Partnership). Trump came within a whisker of inviting the Taliban to Camp David. He covered for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman #8217;s role in the grisly murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He praised illiberal autocratic regimes in Eastern Europe. And his denunciation of the domestic media as an  #8220;enemy of the people #8221; empowered dictators around the world to jail, kill and intimidate their own journalists. I #8217;m sure a calamity or two has slipped my mind. Nevertheless, history will record Trump as the worst foreign policy president since Lyndon B. Johnson. The Republicans who defended and enabled him would have declared Obama a traitor had he done any of this. Trump, who revels in his own ignorance, never bothered to learn about the world and never cared for a values-based foreign policy. Republicans who derided Obama, took credit for the victory in the Cold War and insisted on the necessity of U.S. leadership in the world disgraced themselves by their partisan support of an inept and unfit president. It is one more reason no elected Republican and no Republican who joined and defended this cavalcade of stupidity should be trusted with power again. Ever."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Never has a politician accorded his opponent so much power. Last week, President Trump said that if former vice president Joe Biden won the White House, he would  #8220;hurt God. #8221; Wow! What supernatural chops! Trump did not specify how exactly a mere mortal could  #8220;hurt #8221; the Almighty, but he warns Biden would create a world of  #8220;no religion, no anything. #8221;  #8220;He #8217;s against God. He #8217;s against guns. He #8217;s against energy, our kind of energy, #8221; said Trump. Yes, energy sources are now polarized between red and blue, and the Supreme Being is part of it. Trump, of course, has little understanding of religion, or much of a connection with faith. He saw no problem with holding a Bible aloft as a political weapon without referencing anything that it teaches us. (By the way, he said Biden would  #8220;hurt the Bible, #8221; too.) With no offense intended to elementary school students, Trump has a crude, fifth-grade understanding of the words and phrases that spur White, socially conservative voters to turn out for him, own the liberals and push back against the dreaded secularists and atheists. The dispiriting part is that this paint-by-the-numbers approach has worked for Trump. He continues to fare better among White evangelicals than in any other definable group in the electorate, even if his numbers have slipped a bit during the pandemic. His strength with those who are White, devout and conservative endures despite the witness against him of many deeply committed Christians who recognize  #8220;The Spiritual Danger of Donald Trump, #8221; the apt title of a prophetic collection of essays edited by evangelical activist Ronald J. Sider. Here #8217;s the good news: Trump #8217;s truly idiotic language and Biden #8217;s own faith open new opportunities to push back against forms of religious warfare that have done grave damage both to religion and to our politics. Trump #8217;s theology-free theology and his reduction of God to a political consultant #8217;s role offer Biden, and progressives more generally, a large opening for reconciliation. Think of it as a Providential moment. Biden #8217;s initial response to Trump #8217;s bizarre salvo was promising. He issued a statement declaring that faith is the  #8220;bedrock foundation of my life, #8221; and declared that Trump #8217;s  #8220;decision today to profane God and to smear my faith in a political attack is a stark reminder of what the stakes of this fight truly are. #8221; Trump #8217;s comments also had a whiplash effect, spurring new journalistic explorations of how Catholicism has shaped Biden #8217;s worldview. You might think Biden #8217;s response was a no-brainer, but Democrats have been increasingly reluctant to talk about faith because religion presents the party with an enormous coalition management problem. It #8217;s a problem Republicans don #8217;t confront because their party is far more homogeneous by both race and religion. Fully 65 percent of Republicans are White Christians (49 percent Protestant and 16 percent Catholic), according to surveys by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), but White Christians account for only 38 percent of Democrats. And fully 25 percent of Democrats are religiously unaffiliated. The movement away from religion is especially pronounced among younger Americans  #8212; an important source of Democratic votes  #8212; with 40 percent or more declaring themselves unaffiliated. [Chart showing the widening religious gap between Democrats and Republicans, 2019] In 2016, Hillary Clinton #8217;s campaign was divided over how she should approach religion. Some strategists feared that if she spoke too much about her Methodist faith (by all accounts, it is both real and deep), she might turn off the younger and intensely secular voters she needed to get to the polls. The tragedy is that Clinton, a candidate whose  #8220;authenticity #8221; was always being questioned, was at her authentic best when she was talking about how faith influenced her life and moved her toward more progressive political views, particularly on civil rights. The one time she truly let loose her inner preacher was during the South Carolina primary, when she was inspired by her many visits to Black churches Her experience speaks to a vicious cycle: The more religion is associated with right-wing politics, the more alienated from religion progressives become, and the more inclined they are to dismiss religious people altogether. But the more progressives do this, the easier they make it for right-wing politicians to cast liberals as hostile to faith  #8212; and, reductio ad absurdum, as eager to  #8220;hurt God. #8221; The price for religion is just as high. Those who insist that faith requires supporting Trump and opposing LGBTQ rights (which younger Americans overwhelmingly support regardless of party) are closing off large categories of their fellow citizens to the possibility of dialogue and, yes, conversion. By devoting effort to ending the Catch-22 around religion, Biden would do more than prove he has no interest in hurting God. He could also help create a politics more worthy of a faith that sees the ability to love each other as central to salvation."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Deprived of rallies, President Trump came up with the mind-numbing idea to hold not one but two news conferences at his exclusive country club this weekend. The audience was nearly all rich White men (able to pay several hundreds of thousands of dollars for club membership and fees) who hooted at the press and applauded Trump as a pandemic rages outside. Consider the psychology of a person who needs to stage such events  #8212; and who convinces himself they are a reflection of his true popularity. Trump is perpetually searching for ways to convince himself that he is not a disastrous president about to lose his seat. Consider also the image of a super-rich president with super-rich friends at an exclusive club while Americans lose eviction protections, while the $600 federal unemployment subsidy legally expires and while Republicans complain that such a tiny sum (not the double-digit unemployment) encourages laziness. It would be hard to create a more damning portrait of clueless, greedy and self-satisfied elites if you tried. Instead of addressing the problems the pandemic still poses, Trump puts on a show by signing executive orders  #8212; or  #8220;unconstitutional slop #8221; as Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) put it. (I trust that Sasse will join in any legal action and/or vote to disable this hooey.) For starters, the notion of an executive order to replace expired spending bills passed by Congress is nonsensical. Congress had to pass a law to achieve items such as enhanced unemployment insurance; Congress has to pass a law to continue them. Otherwise, Trump could have waved his wand months ago to accomplish whatever he thinks he is accomplishing. Trump is first attempting to delay payroll tax collection  #8212; something that does not help the unemployed, does not eliminate the tax and does not acknowledge Congress #8217;s prime role in tax legislation. Moreover, by this action and his stated determination to cut payroll taxes permanently, Trump has fallen into the most obvious of political traps: He #8217;s essentially attacking funding for Social Security and Medicare. Second, Trump says he is extending an unemployment insurance subsidy of $400. This is a cynical ploy.  #8220;He calls for $44 billion of funding from the Department of Homeland Security #8217;s Disaster Relief Fund that is normally used for hurricanes, tornadoes and massive fires to be shifted over to unemployment, #8221; The Post reports. Having snatched money from the military for his wall, he now robs disaster relief without authorization to pay for something entirely unrelated. Moreover, even on its own terms, it would pay for just a few more weeks of unemployment insurance. Third, he wants to  #8220;consider #8221; whether an eviction ban is needed. I #8217;ll save him the trouble: yes. Meanwhile, millions of Americans face eviction while Trump studies the obvious. Landlords do not take considerations in lieu of rent checks. Finally, Trump is deferring student loan payments  #8212; which is nice for college graduates, but does nothing to feed a single mom, give a family without income $600 to get by, help prepare K-12 schools to operate in a pandemic or keep police, firefighters, nurses and teachers from being laid off because state and local coffers are dry. Former vice president Joe Biden responded to the phony executive emails:  #8220;This is no art of the deal. This is not presidential leadership. #8221; He went on:  #8220;These orders are not real solutions. They are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility. Some measures do far more harm than good. #8221; Trump is delusional if he thinks shows at his country club will alleviate his political problem or Republicans #8217; surefire road to losing the Senate. The reviews are rotten; the show will be canceled in November."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held 7 to 2 on Friday that former White House counsel Donald McGahn, who refused to appear before the House Judiciary Committee, must in fact respond to its subpoena. This ruling may come too late to make a difference when it comes to investigating Trump, but it is important and welcome nonetheless. The court found that  #8220;by virtue of the House #8217;s long-recognized subpoena power, the Committee was entitled to McGahn #8217;s testimony pursuant to its duly issued subpoena, which he has never challenged, and the specific information the Committee would learn therefrom in connection with carrying out its constitutional duties. #8221; The decision continued,  #8220;By defying the subpoena, McGahn has deprived the Committee of that testimony and that deprivation is a concrete injury. #8221; The court reaffirmed what should have been obvious all along:  #8220;The power of each House of Congress to compel witnesses to appear before it to testify and to produce documentary evidence has a pedigree predating the Founding and has long been employed in Congress #8217;s discharge of its primary constitutional responsibilities: legislating, conducting oversight of the federal government, and, when necessary, checking the President through the power of impeachment. #8221; The circuit court had the benefit of the Supreme Court #8217;s decisions in Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Vance, rejecting any  #8220;absolute immunity #8221; to protect Trump #8217;s financial documents from a subpoena. The same, the appeals court held, applies to live witnesses. The case was sent back to the district court to resolve other challenges. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tells me that  #8220;although the 7-to-2 win for the House is a limited and potentially short-lived victory vis-a-vis Trump and McGahn, who will keep litigating immunity and privilege claims till the cows come home, the en banc D.C. Circuit decision vindicated a vital set of congressional oversight powers and separation of powers principles that will matter as long as our constitutional republic stands. #8221; There are several important takeaways from the decision: First, the House impeachment managers were correct to move forward before legal challenges about McGahn and others were resolved, as Republicans disingenuously suggested. We are now in August and, as Tribe reminds us, McGahn #8217;s case will travel up and down the courts a few times before a  #8220;final #8221; decision is reached. Second, the ability of a chief executive to rob Congress of its oversight and impeachment powers merely by delay and litigation cries out for Congress to craft a new, quick resolution process in the case of congressional subpoenas, perhaps an emergency appeal directly to the D.C. Circuit if not the Supreme Court itself. In any list of post-Trump reforms, this should be near the top. Finally, if the next Congress or a truth commission of some sort wants to investigate the numerous scandals involving myriad Trump underlings (for example, Attorney General William P. Barr or Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross) or if there are criminal prosecutions that arise out of the Trump administration, documents and witnesses will be available. Indeed, the availability of witnesses and documents should heavily weigh in favor of post-Trump investigations. Both at the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit, large majorities have upheld the role of Congress as a coequal branch of the government, one whose powers, if thwarted by the president, can be sustained in federal court. This is a win for separation of powers and constitutional democracy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "When the full story of Donald Trump #8217;s presidency is written, one Machiavellian lesson to be drawn will surely run as follows: If you spend much of your tenure openly subverting the nation #8217;s interests to your own  #8212; while manipulating the levers of government in service of unabashedly corrupt and megalomaniacal ends  #8212; then voters will ultimately grow wise to the scam. We are now learning, via an extraordinary new report in the New York Times, that many scientists fear that Trump will attempt the ultimate  #8220;October surprise. #8221; These scientists  #8212; which include some inside the government  #8212; worry that Trump will thoroughly corrupt the process designed to ensure the safety and efficacy of any new vaccine against the coronavirus. It is the perfect Trumpian paradox that his long record of just this sort of corruption underscores why this scenario should be entertained with deadly seriousness  #8212; but also why it will likely fail. As the Times reports,  #8220;experts inside and outside the government #8221; fear that  #8220;the White House will push the Food and Drug Administration to overlook insufficient data and give at least limited emergency approval to a vaccine, perhaps for use by specific groups like front-line health care workers, before the vote on Nov. 3. #8221; Importantly, this is not just speculative. These insiders already see concrete grounds for fearing this is underway, and some are actively working to maintain the integrity of the process. Among the revelations: - As part of the exhaustive process of approving vaccines, an independent advisory panel of outside experts is supposed to weigh in, and the FDA generally follows their advice. But under questioning from the Times, a senior administration official refused to confirm that any emergency approval will be vetted through that panel. - One member of that FDA advisory committee says on the record that many people inside the process  #8220;are very nervous #8221; about whether the administration will prematurely say a vaccine has been tested and is safe, and then  #8220;roll it out. #8221; This expert says these people are right to be worried about this:  #8220;They should be. #8221; - Trump told supporters on Sunday night that he expects a vaccine to be available  #8220;far ahead of schedule #8221; and  #8220;very, very early before the end of the year. #8221; That #8217;s at odds with his own health experts #8217; claim that the most realistic expectation is early 2021, and Trump also said the FDA has  #8220;been great, at my instruction. #8221; His intentions are clear: At minimum, he will try to push up limited approval so it happens before the election, and then take credit for making that happen. - Trump has explicitly tied the timing of the vaccine to his reelection needs. When he announced a campaign shake-up, he also said he #8217;ll win in part because vaccines will  #8220;soon be on the way. #8221; - Jared Kushner is a  #8220;regular participant in meetings" overseeing the vaccine effort, the Times reports. Given the role of Trump #8217;s son-in-law in steering reelection strategy and his lack of expertise, it #8217;s hard to imagine Kushner is there to ensure quality control. - People familiar with those conversations tell the Times that White House officials regularly ask about getting a vaccine by October. Trump #8217;s campaign advisers privately refer to a vaccine before the election as  #8220;the holy grail. #8221; To be fair, Anthony S. Fauci, who is widely trusted by the public, told Congress last week he #8217;s  #8220;certain #8221; the vaccine trial effort will not be corrupted. The Times also reports that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn insists his  #8220;job #8221; is to insulate scientists from political pressure. That #8217;s good, but in March, the FDA gave emergency approval to hydroxychloroquine for distribution to hospitals, a drug Trump pushed relentlessly, before pulling that approval. Which illustrates a crucial point here: Even if top officials do have good intentions, what #8217;s worrisome is that Trump will almost certainly try to corrupt this whole process, in a way that prioritizes his own perceived political needs over the national interest. Trump has already done this, repeatedly. In January, he raged at his health officials for using their government stature to warn the public about the coronavirus, not due to serious scientific disagreement but because he feared it would spook the markets, which he views as crucial to reelection. In May, White House advisers built a statistical model  #8212; embraced by the same Jared Kushner now monitoring vaccine trials  #8212; that provided far more optimistic grounds about projected deaths than other ones, to justify Trump #8217;s push to reopen. The pessimistic models were right. In July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for reopening schools (which Trump has urged forward to help manufacture the illusion of a rebound to normalcy) that downplayed risks and were edited by the White House. One senior health official even accused the CDC of  #8220;undermining the president #8221; after it warned of coronavirus risks to pregnant women. We #8217;ve seen this on multiple other fronts. Trump pressured a top official to produce  #8220;evidence #8221; of large inaugural crowds. The White House created a commission to validate his lies about voter fraud. Officials have repeatedly conjured official-seeming statistics and presentations to buttress his lies about the border. Trump even got impeached for subverting national security policy to his effort to smear Joe Biden. And don #8217;t forget Sharpie-gate! In the end, it #8217;s likely that Trump #8217;s long trail of deliberate uses of the government to bolster his deceptions, agitprop and corrupt designs will itself undo any vaccine Hail Mary. Even if Trump does manage to rush forward such an announcement, why would voters trust him to carry forward the long and complex process to follow in good faith or out of any meaningful conception of what #8217;s in the national interest?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump has admitted to intentional voter suppression. The Post reports,  #8220;President Trump said Thursday that he does not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are seeking to expand mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic, making explicit the reason he has declined to approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the cash-strapped agency. #8221; There is no nuance, no joke. Republicans are firmly opposing free and fair elections  #8212; unless they do something about this. Trump and Republicans have been successful in imposing a raft of measures designed to deter voting (voter ID requirements, limits on early voting, closing poll locations in poor areas, purging voter rolls), but they have usually disguised their activities under the bogus heading of  #8220;fraud prevention. #8221; Voter fraud is exceptionally rare, whether in person or by mail. (In recent cases, such as the attempt at fraud by Republican operatives in North Carolina #8217;s 9th Congressional District, the suspects were caught.) Perhaps Trump forgot that just the other day he was praising voting by mail in Florida. Now, he is apparently content to make it difficult if not impossible for millions of people concerned about their health in the pandemic to vote from home. The irony, of course, is that Republicans are now spooked about absentee ballots and thereby risk losing out when their own voters cannot get to the polls (or face long lines) on Election Day. That is why many state and local Republican groups are pulling their hair out in response to Trump #8217;s anti-absentee vote rhetoric. Asked about Trump #8217;s comments at her news conference on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that Trump is  #8220;afraid of the American people. He #8217;s been afraid for a while. He knows that on the legit, it #8217;d be hard for him to win. So he wants to put obstacles of participation. #8221; She vowed,  #8220;But we do not agonize, we organize. #8221; Trump #8217;s war on the U.S. Postal Service is not just un-American and anti-democratic, but foolish. A great many people, including veterans and the elderly (especially in rural areas), depend on mail. VoteVets, a progressive veterans group, put out an ad making this point: [Vote for Vets ad on Twitter] Democrats should not shy from hardball here. Why does Trump hate vets and the elderly? Why is Trump afraid of voting? Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) surely can raise the visibility of the issue, since it goes to the heart of the Trump plague. He would rather destroy government or co-opt it than put the interests of the people over his own (getting dirt on an opponent from a foreign government, using his office to promote hotels, refusing to protect U.S. troops rather than confront his BFF Vladimir Putin). He would rather shift blame to others or simply lie than use the powers of the federal government to set up a national testing and tracing system to address the pandemic. He would rather endanger children by returning them to classrooms in hopes of improving the economy than spend money, if local conditions require, to have them attend school virtually or through a hybrid system. This is anti-government animus at a whole new level. It is a deliberate scheme to wreck the operation of government so he can stay in power. This is the conduct of tin pot dictators. Other than highlight and condemn Trump #8217;s shenanigans, what can Democrats and other pro-democracy Americans do? First, every Democrat, especially in rural areas or those with a significant percentage of veterans and elderly voters, should force Republicans to explain why they are complicit in destroying the Postal Service. Second, Democrats need to make an all-out push not just for early, in-person voting but also early return of absentee ballots. In addition, most states have an option to drop off absentee ballots at an election location. If seniors or others need help doing this, volunteers must be organized to drive them to drop-off locations. Third, states and localities need to be pressured to create ballot drop boxes in multiple locations, near shopping areas and other accessible places. If the Michael Bloombergs and Tom Steyers are looking for something useful to do, they can blanket the airwaves with a simple message: Vote early  #8212; from home or at the polls. Drop it off in person, if you can."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Donald Trump won non-college graduates by a 51-to-44 percent margin in 2016; in the latest NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll, he trails 46 to 48 percent among this group. Trump won White non-college graduates by a 66-to-29 percent margin four years ago; today, his lead has shrunk to 55 to 40. Trump won White college graduates by a 48-to-45 margin; in the new poll, he now trails Democrat Joe Biden 40 percent to 57 percent. In 2016, among all women, Trump lost 54 to 41 percent; that is now 59/35. Trump lost White female college graduates 44 to 51 percent; that is now 37 to 59 percent. White non-college-educated women went for Trump by a 61-to-34 percent margin in 2016; that lead is down to 52/43. Trump #8217;s support from White men is also dropping. Among White men without college degrees, he has gone from 71/23 to 58/37; among White men with college degrees, Trump went from up 53/39 over Hillary Clinton to down 43/54 to Biden. And here is the shocker: His 20-point advantage among White voters (57/37) has disappeared (48/48). In short, college graduates have shifted overwhelmingly away from Trump (from a 10-point deficit to a 25-point deficit); the lead among White college-educated voters has flipped to a considerable disadvantage. Among those without college degrees, including Whites, Trump still leads, but by smaller margins than in 2016. His problem with women has intensified. Whatever appeal Trump is making to Whites by embracing the Confederacy and otherwise flaunting his white-supremacist views (low-income housing will invade the suburbs!) has backfired. Between his appeals to bigotry and his incompetent handling of the coronavirus, he has ceded college-educated voters to the Democrats, lost White male college graduates almost entirely and made his problem with female voters worse. He has not gotten a boost among less-educated Whites; to the contrary, he has lost support from these voters, too. Aside from Trump #8217;s continuing slide (his deficit overall in the NPR/PBS/Marist poll went from eight to 11 points), the evidence of his negative impact on fellow Republicans is piling up. He is dragging the House down with him. Cook Political Report has shifted  #8220;ratings in 15 more districts, including 11 moves towards Democrats and four towards Republicans. #8221; The Democrats are now favored to expand their lead. Now the Democrats are favored to win back the Senate. Both House and Senate Republicans may be damaged by Trump #8217;s baseless attacks against voting by mail and his efforts to hobble the U.S. Postal Service. Democrats are organizing absentee-ballot mail drives and encouraging voters to return ballots early to avoid delays; Republicans insist on going to vote in person, which they might have difficulty doing (either because of their own health concerns or because of Election Day lines). Whether intentional or not, Trump is sabotaging his own party. Rather than break with Trump (especially on efforts to promote mail-in ballots), Republicans are like deer in the headlights, awaiting their fate. The media should cease searching for a rationale for Trump #8217;s actions. He launches into right-wing conspiracy theories and racist attacks because that is what he sees in right-wing media and what his sycophantic advisers tell him will work. He #8217;s convinced there is an electoral majority of voters out there  #8212; albeit one he must artificially devise by suppressing votes for Democrats  #8212; so consumed by white grievance that they are prepared to ignore his gross incompetence. The good news for America is that there are far fewer of those voters than necessary to return Trump to office, and millions of Americans (especially the college-educated) who are disgusted by Trump and his minions. This time, they won #8217;t stay home or throw their votes away on a third-party candidate."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It has been quite a show as President Trump and the Republicans moved feverishly  #8212; and at times hysterically  #8212; from one attack line against Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) to another. In one instant, former vice president Joe Biden #8217;s running mate is a dangerous left-winger. Then, suddenly, she #8217;s a  #8220;top cop #8221; and an unprincipled sellout to the progressive cause. She is, as all women who oppose Trump are eventually labeled,  #8220;nasty. #8221; And it was only a matter of time before we were treated to another round of tired, old, libelous birtherism. Hey, the U.S.-born Harris is the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, so in the Trumpian worldview, there must be something wrong. The greatest hits of racism and nativism keep on coming. But this manic incoherence speaks to a larger problem for a radicalized Republican Party: They have moved so far to the right that they see even moderation as socialist radicalism. A party closer to what can fairly be called the political center would grasp that this moment of national crisis demands more aggressive and coherent action by government than the GOP #8217;s low-tax, free market, wait-and-see bromides would admit. Republicans briefly accepted this when they joined with Democrats earlier this year to send more than $2 trillion of relief into an ailing country. But although the economy continues to stagger, Republicans have lost their sense of urgency. Many in their ranks just can #8217;t accept how much support Americans facing hardship, and the economy as a whole, need. So, they refuse to meet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) in the middle. Republicans are saying they can #8217;t accept much more than $1 trillion in new assistance. Pelosi and Schumer rightly think it will take something closer to $3 trillion to ward off personal and collective disaster. While the Senate was sleeping, Pelosi pushed her package through the House in May. In the sort of middle-ground compromise that Congress was once good at, Pelosi suggested the parties split the difference, agree on a $2 trillion package and negotiate its content from there. No dice, said the Republicans. And Congress went home without a deal. This failure of contemporary U.S. conservatism to grasp the realities of the moment extends beyond the immediate crisis. Over the past four decades, the distribution of income and wealth in the country has become wildly unequal. This is a social problem for the country, aggravating divisions of all kinds. It hits hardest at Black Americans and Latinos, but also undermines the living standards of working-class Whites, many of whom gravitated to Trump in protest in 2016. But it is also bad economics. In a consumer-driven economy, it makes good sense, as former president Barack Obama once said, to  #8220;spread the wealth around. #8221; Republicans assailed Obama for saying that. But his words were simply a description of how modestly more egalitarian policies in the decades after World War II produced widely shared income growth and a booming economy overall. And this is where the Harris conundrum comes into focus. She is, at once, a pragmatist and a progressive  #8212; and, at the moment, those two dispositions make a good fit. Supporters of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are not wrong in seeing Harris as less invested in attacks on corporate power than the candidates they championed. But Harris has been consistent in favoring policies that would take large steps to redress the country #8217;s economic imbalances. The most innovative idea that emerged from her brief presidential campaign in 2019 was the  #8220;LIFT the Middle Class Act #8221; to help lower- and middle-income workers. It provided an income supplement of $250 a month for single people and $500 a month for married couples, phasing out at $50,000 a year in income for singles without children and at $100,000 for singles with kids and married couples. As Vox #8217;s Dylan Matthews noted at the time Harris introduced the idea, it was  #8220;arguably the closest thing that any 2020 contender has proposed to a universal basic income. #8221; According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it would lift 9 million people out of poverty. Harris #8217;s response to the current downturn was consistent with this approach. With Sanders and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), she co-sponsored a bill in May that would provide $2,000 a month for every American in a family with an income of below $120,000. It #8217;s unlikely that Biden will fully embrace these ideas. But they show that Harris is serious about inequality and in search of practical ways to push back against it. And unlike Trump and Senate Republicans, Harris acknowledges the extent of hardship in the country. No wonder they keep flailing away at her: Her pragmatism exposes their radicalism."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It speaks volumes about the nature of the presidential race that President Trump plans on popping up for all four nights of his virtual convention. Former vice president Joe Biden, by contrast, will show off  #8220;a star-studded array of the country #8217;s most prominent party leaders, key allies of presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, and rising stars in Democratic circles, #8221; ABC News reports. He #8217;ll appear, as is the tradition, on the last night. Trump insists on making it all about him; Biden is delighted to make this a referendum on Trump. The Biden general election campaign so far seems to be remarkably competent and disciplined. Biden #8217;s team prevented any leaks about the identity of Biden #8217;s pick for vice president. They scripted the rollout speeches for Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), which came off without technical or other glitches. They have put Biden out there over the last month or so to deliver a series of meaty policy speeches all focused on the economy and recovery from the coronavirus  #8212; with special emphasis on addressing disparities that have disadvantaged Blacks, Hispanics and other communities. His proposals are bold enough to satisfy the left, but none of it sounds like he is upending capitalism. Certainly, Biden  #8212; but more often his staff  #8212; condemns Trump #8217;s egregious racism, misogyny and xenophobia. However, unlike Hillary Clinton #8217;s campaign, the Biden campaign is not designed to show what an awful human Trump is. That #8217;s a given. What they want to say rather is simple: He failed. You #8217;re hurting. We #8217;re the grown-ups to clean up the mess. That, in some sense is what every challenger runs on when confronting an incumbent seeking his second term, but Biden and Harris have three huge assets to amplify their message. First, every time Trump opens his mouth, he confirms that he is an incompetent narcissist who has no idea about the concerns of ordinary Americans. He wants to reopen states really, really fast and force in-person schooling. The public is concerned we are opening too fast, and is frightened to send their kids back to classrooms with the virus still raging. Trump says testing is fine; we know it is not, as Americans are forced to wait a week or more for results. Trump says the anarchists are taking over cities. Americans do not see it. Mostly, the cities look forlorn, littered with empty shop fronts. Trump makes Biden #8217;s argument better than any opponent could: He is entirely clueless and incapable of handling the crises he is largely responsible for creating. Second, the right track/wrong track numbers have blown up in Trump #8217;s face. According to the RealClearPolitics average, 70 percent of the country thinks we are on the wrong track. Americans know they are out of work. They know their lives have been disrupted. They know their kids are losing months and months of education. They don #8217;t even get college football. Trump even managed to screw up the post office. No matter how many times Trump says he regrets nothing and nothing is his fault, it does not work that way. He is president. He is in charge. The results are awful. Third, both Biden and Harris have deprived Trump of the  #8220;socialist #8221; target Republicans yearned to confront. Yes, the Democrats have a robust and progressive agenda, but they are not outlawing private health-care insurance. They are not condemning capitalism. The charge that they are crazy leftists simply falls flat. What kind of nutty stuff are they doing? Offering subsidized child care so working parents can get back to their jobs. That does not sound like socialism to anyone outside the right-wing fever swamps. An infrastructure plan isn #8217;t radical; in fact, Trump has tried over and over again to launch one but has been too incompetent to pull it off. Strengthening Obamacare? Most Americans don #8217;t think that is socialism. They like it. What is radical is going to court to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act. It is apparent that the radicals in the election are the Republicans, whose hostility to government and loyalty to the donor class have created a sort of dystopian nightmare where only the plutocrats have the resources to fend for themselves. It is not impossible for the race to tighten. It would certainly help Republicans if they kept Trump tied up in that underground bunker, out of sight and out of the news. However, barring an unforeseen disaster, the Biden-Harris team looks on track to claim a commanding victory. It is telling that the Biden camp #8217;s biggest concern these days is neither Trump nor their own ticket, but rather Trump #8217;s efforts to delegitimize and disrupt an election he in all likelihood is going to lose  #8212; by a lot."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Democrats will gather for their convention this week with dreams of another New Deal dancing in their heads.  #8220;Gather #8221; is a polite fiction, of course, since nearly everything will occur remotely in the purest media event ever. But the format will not stop party loyalists from savoring the possibility of a sweeping victory akin to Franklin D. Roosevelt #8217;s triumph over President Herbert Hoover in 1932. Their hopes are not fanciful. President Trump #8217;s catastrophic fumbling in the face of a pandemic and economic collapse invites comparison to Hoover #8217;s haplessness, even if the 31st president was as morally upright as the 45th is not. Every second of the gathering will be an advertisement of Trump #8217;s failure: The convention that could not meet because of the health crisis the incumbent could not manage. And a New Deal-style commitment to active, fact-based, problem-solving government really does match the mood of a country that wants a virus conquered, jobs and incomes on the rise again and fairness enshrined in the economic system. When Roosevelt broke with tradition by appearing in person at the 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago  #8212; a move he called,  #8220;unprecedented and unusual, but these are unprecedented and unusual times #8221;  #8212; he gave a phrase to history:  #8220;I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people. #8221; But he also spoke of  #8220;two ways of viewing the Government #8217;s duty in matters affecting economic and social life. #8221;  #8220;The first, #8221; he said,  #8220;sees to it that a favored few are helped and hopes that some of their prosperity will leak through, sift through, to labor, to the farmer, to the small business man. That theory belongs to the party of Toryism, and I had hoped that most of the Tories left this country in 1776. But it is not and never will be the theory of the Democratic Party. #8221; It #8217;s not hard to imagine Joe Biden or Kamala Harris saying the same. And it would be one of those tricks history sometimes plays if Biden, whose national career began the year the original New Deal coalition collapsed for good, were to reinaugurate a New Deal-inspired approach to politics. The old alliance was shattered in 1972 when Richard Nixon crushed Democrat George McGovern in a landslide that encompassed Biden #8217;s Delaware, where Nixon won by 20 points. In an early sign of his political savvy, a 29-year-old Biden  #8212; he turned the constitutionally required age of 30 after the election  #8212; battled the Nixon tide to upset an incumbent Republican and launch a 36-year Senate career. If the 2020 Democratic Party is different from its 1972 version, the contrast with Roosevelt #8217;s party in 1932 is even more stark. In Roosevelt #8217;s day, Southern Democrats openly advocated white supremacy and could not have imagined being part of a party that would make Barack Obama the first Black president. It would have astonished the crowd at Roosevelt #8217;s convention that Biden #8217;s selection of a Black woman, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, would be widely viewed as the obvious, safest choice for a running mate. The Democrats #8217; move from being the party of segregation to the party of inclusion was the product of a long struggle and remains a source of pride. But the ensuing backlash that began in the late 1960s undid the New Deal alliance, moving most of the states of the old Confederacy and a fair share of former Democratic voters elsewhere into the GOP column. Nixon #8217;s victory over McGovern was, in part, the fruit of his Southern Strategy, which has morphed under Trump into outright racism. Voters will be rendering a judgment on that history this year, but they are also being called upon to ratify Roosevelt #8217;s own contribution to the politics of inclusion. Timid on race, Roosevelt rejected nativism and built an alliance with Northern working-class immigrants  #8212; among them Italians, Eastern European Jews, Poles and the Irish. He reminded old stock White Americans (like himself) that they, too, were  #8220;descended from immigrants and revolutionists. #8221; Thus, if Biden #8217;s choice of Harris reaffirms his party #8217;s more recent embrace of racial equality, it is also a latter-day version of Roosevelt #8217;s bet: that a new generation of immigrants  #8212; this time from Asia and the Caribbean, from Latin America and Africa  #8212; would, in alliance with other Americans fed up with incompetence and divisiveness, drive a transformation of our politics. Much of the week #8217;s speechmaking will focus on the calamity that is Trump #8217;s presidency. But the historic task of this  #8220;unprecedented and unusual #8221; convention is clear: To help Biden prove that a 21st-century New Deal alignment can be assembled from more diverse building blocks by embracing both racial and economic justice."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: [Shortened for length] "It was one of the biggest moments of President Barack Obama #8217;s tenure, the signing of his landmark health-care law. Every word was planned. Message discipline was critical, particularly for the administration #8217;s least scripted member: Joe Biden. The vice president #8217;s staff had worked on the remarks late into the night. There was the quote from Virgil. The nod to history. The praise of the president. But in the end, all anyone remembered was a single off-color, off-the-cuff phrase, one Biden intended to whisper to Obama but was caught on mic:  #8220;This is a big [expletive] deal. #8221; For those who have tried to write speeches for Biden, it was a signature moment. He likes his language simple and direct. He wants to communicate things in their essence. And he rarely follows the script. Biden now faces the most consequential speech of his political career  #8212; Thursday #8217;s address claiming the Democratic nomination he has sought for much of his life  #8212; and it will unfold under extraordinary circumstances, with strict social distancing and no cheering crowd in the room. It comes days after a similarly constrained speech, Biden #8217;s introduction of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate. A speaker who thrives on speaking extemporaneously, often feeding off his audience and just as often frustrating his staff, is now preparing for something he #8217;s never faced. His speechwriters are attempting to craft something entirely new  #8212; a convention speech without built-in applause lines, lacking the crowd #8217;s appreciative laughter or adoring cheers, during which any pause could look awkward or worse. Public speaking has in many ways been an organizing element of Biden #8217;s life. For decades he has used speeches not just to ask for votes or outline policy, but also to express his grief and vent his emotions. Speeches have taught him when he #8217;s able to move a crowd and when he #8217;s struggling to connect. Aides are now closely monitoring his speeches for a sense of which campaign promises he will want to prioritize should he win in November. It was Biden #8217;s severe childhood stutter that taught him resilience and the power of words, and it is his lingering tendency to bungle words and phrases that the Trump campaign is trying to use to cast doubt on his cognitive abilities. Over the decades, he has given eulogies and commencement addresses, spoken at political rallies and delivered more Senate floor speeches than anyone could reasonably count. Biden as a presidential hopeful in April 1987 emphasizes a point during a speech to students on the University of Iowa campus in Iowa City. Biden as a presidential hopeful in April 1987 emphasizes a point during a speech to students on the University of Iowa campus in Iowa City. (Rodney White/AP) His presidential campaign in 1988 was derailed when he was accused of plagiarizing part of a speech, and since then he has been careful to attribute even the most mundane phrases ( #8220;As the old saying goes,  #8216;Give me a break, #8217; #8201; #8221; he said last week). Three times he has given presidential announcement speeches, and twice he has given withdrawal speeches. This week, for the first time, he will give an acceptance speech. But it will also be one of the most unusual convention speeches in modern history, one delivered in isolation to a country that is itself largely in isolation.  #8220;It #8217;s interesting to engage with the speech process without an audience on the campaign trail, #8221; said Carlyn Reichel, Biden #8217;s campaign speechwriter, who has been helping him craft his remarks.  #8220;You #8217;re not writing to applause lines or thinking about that. You #8217;re really just trying to find ways to connect people who are not only just socially distant, but extremely distant thousands of miles away. #8221; Initially, Biden was to deliver the address before thousands of giddy, sign-waving Democrats in Milwaukee. Instead, he and Harris will give their speeches in a largely empty hall at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del., a waterfront event center not far from his home. Politicians have long used their speaking style to define themselves, from George W. Bush #8217;s folksy banter to Obama #8217;s soaring phrases. Biden #8217;s opponent, President Trump, rose to power in no small part on the strength of his belligerent, crude rhetoric, which enthralls his supporters and appalls his detractors. Biden #8217;s approach is to draw on his emotions and telegraph empathy, to be granular and simple, to tell a story. He strains to connect with the crowd, unafraid to come to the verge of tears in front of an audience. Some of his better moments, according to those who have worked for him, come from words he never wrote down. A 2012 speech to military families, where the then-vice president talked about the crushing weight of grief, speaking of the day he lost his wife and infant daughter in a car crash, was almost completely off the cuff  #8212; and among his most powerful speeches.  #8220;I realized how someone could consciously decide to commit suicide, #8221; Biden said at the time, hunched over the lectern.  #8220;Not because they were deranged, not because they were nuts. Because they #8217;d been to the top of the mountain, and they just knew in their heart they #8217;d never get there again, that it was never going to get  #8212; never going to be that way ever again. #8221; Less tragically, it has long been a running joke that among the most challenging jobs in American politics is writing a speech for Biden. He is allergic to following a teleprompter, frequently veers from the prepared text and can walk himself into verbal cul-de-sacs. He stops abruptly mid-sentence and says,  #8220;Well, anyway. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Miles Taylor, who served as chief of staff to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, has recorded an ad for Republican Voters Against Trump that may be the most compelling of the 2020 election cycle: The ad, released on Monday, strikes one as entirely authentic, its description of President Trump a perfect distillation of behaviors we sometimes glimpse, but which are undoubtedly reflections of his deep emotional and intellectual unfitness to lead. We #8217;ve seen the president #8217;s disdain for law and for facts, his vindictiveness, his lack of interest in the country #8217;s needs (only his own matter). Now, we get some granular detail from an eyewitness. It adds to Taylor #8217;s credibility that he doesn #8217;t go overboard in supporting former vice president Joe Biden; he simply affirms that the presumptive Democratic nominee, unlike Trump, will act to defend the country. In a Post op-ed, also released on Monday, Taylor adds detail to what we could have only surmised was the story behind chaotic policy rollouts.  #8220;The decision-making process was itself broken: Trump would abruptly endorse policy proposals with little or no consideration, by him or his advisers, of possible knock-on effects, #8221; Taylor writes.  #8220;That was the case in 2018 when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced, at the White House #8217;s urging, a  #8216;zero tolerance #8217; policy to prosecute anyone who crossed the border illegally. The agencies involved were unprepared to implement the policy, causing a disastrous backlog of detentions that ultimately left migrant parents and their children separated. #8221; The ad raises several troubling issues. First, where have Trump #8217;s most senior advisers been hiding? Former defense secretary Jim Mattis, former homeland security secretary and White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, and former national security adviser John Bolton have to one degree or another criticized Trump (although not with the detail Taylor provides), but where are other former administration officials such as H.R. McMaster, Gary Cohn, Daniel Coats and the slew of chiefs of staff who have cycled in and out of the White House? Why have they not shared the evidence of Trump #8217;s abject unfitness with the public? One feeble argument may be that they did not want to project weakness to allies and foes around the world. Well, if that #8217;s the concern, the cat is out of the bag. The enabling and protecting must stop. Second, many Republicans in the Senate and House are also fully aware of Trump #8217;s erratic behavior. It has been part and parcel of their dangerous sycophancy to  #8220;explain #8221; Trump and make the incoherent seem coherent. They had every opportunity to convict him during his Senate impeachment trial and save the country, not only from someone who by overwhelming evidence was shown to have violated his oath but also from someone they personally knew to be manifestly unfit to serve. The result would not have been a  #8220;coup, #8221; as some alleged. Hillary Clinton was not going to be declared the winner of the 2016 election. Instead, Vice President Pence (another silent witness to the Trump horror show) would be president. Tens of thousands of lives lost to the bungled coronavirus response might have been spared. Third, Republicans are likely heading for losses up and down the ticket in November. Once they are booted out of office, be prepared to hear the excuses and rationalizations.  #8220;Oh, I never bought into his act. #8221;  #8220;I stopped so many bad things from happening. #8221; If they were wise to Trump and saw any of the conduct Taylor points to, they had an obligation to the country to make clear what was going on and at the very least to oppose Trump #8217;s renomination. Once more, we are confronted with the image of a party  #8212; filled with advisers, lawmakers, donors and other office holders  #8212; who let a manifestly dangerous character remain in office."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump is deploying a familiar trick. He will mess up an agency, an initiative or a personnel pick terribly (e.g., stimulus negotiations) and then, after things go badly, blame Democrats. So it is with the U.S. Postal Service, which his donor pal  #8212; Postmaster General Louis DeJoy  #8212; has been crippling through a series of policy changes designed to make the USPS #8217;s operations more cost-effective. (Think about the money we could save at the Pentagon by disbanding the Army, taking weapons offline and halting the purchase of spare parts. It is not the mission of the military, nor of the Postal Service, to turn a profit.) The changes have inconvenienced millions of Americans, put at risk the health of veterans and others who receive prescription drugs by mail, and convinced Americans that Trump is trying to steal the election by hobbling voting-by-mail, which tens of millions of voters will rely upon. In another instance of saying the quiet part out loud, Trump last week declared,  #8220;They don #8217;t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So, therefore, they can #8217;t do it, I guess. Are they going to do it even if they don #8217;t have the money? #8221; Now, he insists it is all the Democrats #8217; fault  #8212; not his, and not the USPS board of governors, all appointed by Trump. You will recall that Democrats included $25 billion for the Postal Service in the Heroes Act, which Trump initially said would be a dealbreaker. The intentional effort to make lives worse for Americans so he can improve his chances in the election turns out  #8212; who knew?  #8212; to be a political loser. You can tell because Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has called the House back into session  #8220;to vote on Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman [Carolyn B.] Maloney #8217;s  #8216;Delivering for America Act, #8217; which prohibits the Postal Service from implementing any changes to operations or level of service it had in place on January 1, 2020 #8221; and for a day of action on Tuesday to protest at post offices in the members #8217; districts. Pelosi also succeeded in dragooning DeJoy to testify next Monday and to produce relevant documents. Meanwhile, Democratic Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) and Ted Lieu (Calif.) called on the FBI to investigate while Democratic state attorneys general and secretaries of state vowed legal action. Things had so deterioriated for Trump that, by Monday afternoon, he was calling to  #8220;MAKE THE POST OFFICE GREAT AGAIN. #8221; Trump also periodically claims he does not really know what DeJoy is doing. (Next, he will tell us he barely knows who he is.) Trump #8217;s effort to upend the mail is not only malicious but mindlessly counterproductive. The president has riled up veterans, senior citizens and rural voters  #8212; groups that generally support Republicans. He has also given Democrats a wake-up call to organize early voting where available, install drop boxes for ballots and urge their voters to mail in absentee ballots quickly (or walk them in for delivery). And, finally, he has played right into former vice president Joe Biden #8217;s hands. Trump is indeed the picture of willful destructiveness, self-absorption and incompetence. With moves like this, Biden hardly needs to say anything to the country Thursday night but  #8220;I won #8217;t screw up your mail. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "If there #8217;s one thing you can say about President Trump and his administration, it #8217;s that nothing is regular except the irregular, which has had myriad damaging consequences for the nation. And it #8217;s had particularly adverse consequences for the federal government #8217;s ability to defend itself in court. The latest example comes in the criminal case against Trump #8217;s first, short-tenured national security adviser, Michael Flynn. He pleaded guilty  #8212; not once but twice  #8212; to charges that he had lied to FBI agents during an interview about his conversations with senior Russian officials during the presidential transition. Despite Flynn #8217;s admissions of guilt, Attorney General William P. Barr filed a motion asking that the case be dismissed  #8212; and supporting Flynn #8217;s effort to have that done without even a hearing before the district judge. Flynn won before an appeals court panel. But when the full court of appeals heard arguments on Flynn #8217;s petition, the judges couldn #8217;t have seemed more bewildered at the Trump administration #8217;s position. The government argued that the district judge couldn #8217;t inquire into the government #8217;s reasons for seeking dismissal even if he #8217;d seen the prosecutor take a bribe, in open court, in exchange for dismissing the case. The Trump administration has been saying things like that a lot lately  #8212; trying to stretch the law in ways that undermine its remaining credibility. It argued that a sitting president #8217;s accountants and bankers can #8217;t be subpoenaed for his personal records during his term in office by either a state grand jury or, without meeting an impossibly high burden, by Congress. It argued that the president #8217;s close aides can #8217;t be called to testify before a congressional committee investigating presidential misconduct. The least trustworthy administration in decades, if not ever, keeps arguing:  #8220;You #8217;ve just got to trust us. #8221; Lawyers have a phrase for the government #8217;s saying  #8220;Trust us. #8221; It #8217;s called the  #8220;presumption of regularity. #8221; The presumption of regularity means that courts should presume that government officials acted through a  #8220;regular #8221; process: that it carefully vetted its policy and scrupulously examined relevant legal precedents. But, as its name suggests, the presumption of regularity rests on the premise that the government is functioning in a regular way. And the Trump administration is anything but regular. Following the cues of a chief executive who despises what he calls the  #8220;deep state, #8221; administration officials have cut corners, displaced career professionals, exiled dissenters and abandoned institutional norms  #8212; in short, circumvented the very processes that justify the presumption of regularity in the first place. The chickens have now come home to roost. Whether they say so explicitly or not, courts have been dispensing with the presumption of regularity. The best example: In the litigation over the 2020 Census, the Supreme Court held that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross #8217;s decision to add a citizenship question to the census form was arbitrary and capricious. The reason?  #8220;Altogether, #8221; Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote,  #8220;the evidence does not match the explanation the secretary gave for his decision. #8221; That #8217;s just a polite lawyer #8217;s way of saying Ross lied. Examples of the administration #8217;s disrespect for regularity are legion, and not just confined to litigated matters. Barr has acted as a virtual one-man band of irregularity: He forced the U.S. attorney in Washington, Jessie K. Liu, out of her job, thereby enabling him to countermand former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III #8217;s sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone. And Barr gave a transparently false account of the Mueller report in the week before it was released to the public. So, too, with other executive departments. Take the firing or removal of career diplomats whose only offense was to stand in the way of the president #8217;s efforts to smear his electoral opponent, former vice president Joe Biden. And it was the perception of irregular process that led the Supreme Court to set aside the Department of Homeland Security #8217;s effort to undo DACA protections for  #8220;dreamers #8221; brought to the country as children. The problem with bypassing professionals and norms is that the decisions you make instead are often transparently foolish, or appear rigged to achieve an unprincipled or corrupt result. Which brings us back to Flynn. No serious criminal lawyer could have written the government #8217;s motion to dismiss the prosecution. The government relied on a single, 64-year-old case on  #8220;materiality #8221; that both the Supreme Court and the court of appeals have repudiated. The government asserted that FBI agents had no legitimate reason to interview Flynn, despite his obvious susceptibility to Russian blackmail. Given the weakness of the government #8217;s arguments, it #8217;s hard not to conclude that it sought to spare Flynn to satisfy the whims of Trump. To be sure, elections have consequences, and political appointees can and should change policies in accordance with their electoral mandate. But ad hoc, one-off decisions that bypass the input of trained professionals end up looking like they were cobbled together for an Audience of One. And that doesn #8217;t cut it under our system of government. Otherwise, the rule of law becomes what an earlier Justice Roberts (Owen Roberts, in 1944) called  #8220;a restricted railway ticket, good for this day and train only. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "By Richard L. Hasen Mr. Hasen is the author of  #8220;Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to American Democracy. #8221; The threat to the 2020 election #8217;s legitimacy finally broke through into everyday conversation last week. People who pay little attention to politics started talking about whether President Trump was looking to mess with the United States Postal Service to slow down the receipt of mail-in ballots. Mr. Trump was not shy about it. He told Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network last Thursday that he was pushing back against Democrats #8217; demand for further U.S.P.S. funding in the latest Covid-19 relief bill:  #8220;Now they need that money in order to have the post office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots  #8230;. But if they don #8217;t get those two items, that means you can #8217;t have universal mail-in voting, because they #8217;re not equipped to have it. #8221; While targeting the U.S. Postal Service may be new, the threat to election integrity coming from Mr. Trump is not. But there are steps we can take right now to assure a fair election in November. Mr. Trump has made at least 91 attacks on the integrity of voting so far this year (and more than 700 since 2012) and backed up his complaints about mail-in ballots with lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Iowa. He has repeatedly tweeted the unsupported claim that increased use of mail-in ballots in November, necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, will lead to voter fraud and a rigged election. Back in May he wrote that  #8220;There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mailboxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged  amp; even illegally printed out  amp; fraudulently signed #8230;. #8221; He said that with Gov. Gavin Newsom of California sending ballots to all active registered voters, which he terms  #8220;universal mail-in #8221; voting,  #8220;This will be a Rigged Election. No way! #8221; The end game here is a bit curious because Republicans traditionally have relied on mail-in balloting to get out the vote, and there are already signs that Republican turnout might be hurt by his rantings. How else to explain the president seeking to distinguish between good  #8220;absentee #8221; voting and bad  #8220;mail-in #8221; balloting and urging Floridians to vote by mail? And how else to explain the president not only repeatedly voting by mail but using a third person  #8212; what Mr. Trump refers to as  #8220;ballot harvesting #8221;  #8212; to deliver his own ballot to election officials in the Florida primary on Tuesday? The most benign explanation for Mr. Trump #8217;s obsessive focus on mail-in balloting is that he is looking for an excuse for a possible loss to his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, in November. The less benign explanation is that he is seeking to sow chaos to drive down turnout and undermine the legitimacy of the election, laying the groundwork for contesting a close election if he loses. I fear that the latter explanation is correct, and that makes it all the more urgent that election administrators, the media and others take steps to avoid a crisis of confidence in the 2020 election results. The benign explanation for Mr. Trump #8217;s conduct  #8212; that it will assuage his ego in the event of a loss to Mr. Biden  #8212; is consistent with how Mr. Trump explained his popular vote loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Although the president won in the Electoral College, he lost the popular vote nationally by about 3 million votes. It seems not a coincidence that Mr. Trump claimed to David Muir of ABC News, without any evidence whatsoever, that 3 million to 5 million noncitizens voted in the 2016 elections, all for Clinton:  #8220;None of  #8217;em come to me. None of  #8217;em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of  #8217;em come to me. #8221; He has now turned from unsubstantiated claims of massive noncitizen voting to claims that mail-in ballots will lead to  #8220;rigged #8221; and  #8220;substantially fraudulent #8221; elections. No doubt he has made this shift because mail-in balloting is set to explode thanks to the pandemic making polling place voting a potential health risk. In Georgia, for example, the state had approximately 37,000 voters vote by mail in the 2016 primaries and more than 1 million voted by mail in the June 9 primary. Here, too, Mr. Trump #8217;s claims of fraud are unsupported by the evidence. Absentee ballot fraud is rare; one study found fewer than 500 prosecutions nationwide during a 12 year period in which voters cast over a billion ballots; most of those cases were not aimed at changing election outcomes, and the ones that were tended to involve small elections when there wasn #8217;t an active press looking for chicanery. The relative rarity of cases is no surprise because states have all kinds of security measures in place, such as signature matching, ballot tracking and statements signed under penalty of perjury. The idea that Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr have raised of foreign governments sending in ballots is particularly ludicrous because it would require quickly copying the paper stock, color and ballot information specific to each voter #8217;s ballot, getting ahold of and forging voter signatures, matching the ballot tracking information that election officials include on ballot envelopes, and doing so on a large enough scale to swing a state #8217;s presidential election contest  #8212; all without the voters in the state whose ballots have been tampered with noticing when they go to vote and election officials tell them they have already turned in a ballot. Indeed, coordinated mail-in ballot tampering tends to get caught quickly. An operative helping a Republican candidate in the 2018 race for North Carolina #8217;s 9th congressional district has been charged with stealing and altering absentee ballots; the scheme led the bipartisan state election board to call a new election. The current scandal in Paterson, N.J., which the president has specifically called out, followed a similar pattern; a postal worker noticed an attempt to mail a stack of absentee ballots, and the ongoing investigation into the ham-handed conspiracy may well lead to criminal charges and an election do-over. If Mr. Trump is not really concerned about fraud, what #8217;s the real end game? His unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud may be aimed at sowing chaos during the election and depressing turnout to help his side win election. Worse, it could be calculated to delegitimize the election results, which could allow Mr. Trump to contest a close election or weaken a Biden presidency. It is all too possible that in Michigan and Pennsylvania  #8212; two states that recently changed their laws to allow anyone who wishes to vote by mail to do so  #8212; Mr. Trump will be ahead in the counting on election night, only to see his lead evaporate days later as Philadelphia, Detroit, and other Democratic-leaning cities process a flood of absentee ballots."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Kamala D. Harris wanted to be president. A former prosecutor, she made what she called her  #8220;proven ability to prosecute the case against this administration #8221; a centerpiece of her presidential campaign. On Wednesday night, she put those skills to work for Joe Biden. In the process, the senator who seeks to become the first Black American and the first woman to be vice president reminded a nation where Africans were brought to be enslaved, and where women were denied the right to vote, that it was possible to achieve  #8220;a beloved community. #8221; It would be a place, she said,  #8220;where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love. #8221; In keeping with expectations that a vice presidential candidate will strike relentlessly at the opposition, Harris continued the online Democratic National Convention #8217;s assault on President Trump #8217;s failures, lies and selfishness. But as prosecutors sometimes decide to do, she chose to speak not angrily or irritably, but in a tone of quiet sorrow over a country confronting pain, distress and exhaustion with a divisive and erratic president.  #8220;Donald Trump #8217;s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods, #8221; Harris said.  #8220;If you #8217;re a parent struggling with your child #8217;s remote learning, or you #8217;re a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know that what we #8217;re doing right now isn #8217;t working. And we are a nation that #8217;s grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy. And yes, the loss of certainty. #8221;  #8220;The constant chaos leaves us adrift, #8221; she said.  #8220;The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It #8217;s a lot. And here #8217;s the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more. #8221; The quieter language reflected a warmer and far more personal Harris than the tough and fiery image she has often cultivated. She spoke of her mother and her husband, of love and of how family has been at the center of her life. It was an introduction to the vast number of Americans who knew little about her, and the softer tone will be a challenge to Trump, who has specialized in gendered attacks. Harris #8217;s prosecutorial burden was also lightened by former president Barack Obama, who offered a sharp and urgent case for change. Obama #8217;s 2020 speech on behalf of his former vice president was, in many ways, more passionate and more insistent than his case for his own reelection at the 2012 convention. For the last three and a half years, Obama clearly felt restrained by norms prescribing that former presidents should refrain from criticizing the current occupant of the Oval Office. Those constraints fell away on Wednesday night. When Trump took office, Obama explained, he had hoped that the new president would at least  #8220;show some interest in taking the job seriously #8221; and  #8220;discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. #8221;  #8220;But he never did, #8221; Obama declared, and what followed was one of the most cutting and comprehensive attacks of the convention so far:  #8220;He #8217;s shown no interest in putting in the work, #8221; Obama declared,  #8220;no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. #8221; And like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday night, Obama also drew attention to Trump #8217;s threat to free government.  #8220;Our democratic institutions [are] threatened as never before, #8221; he said. The twin speeches, combined with statements from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reflected the astonishing discipline that the two-hour-long online convention has imposed on a party that has often turned its guns toward internal rivals. Over and over, the party has stressed three themes: the catastrophe that Trump #8217;s reelection would bring in its wake; the empathy and competence that Biden would bring to the White House; and the Democratic Party #8217;s devotion to diversity, inclusion and social justice  #8212; a nation, as Harris put it, committed to  #8220;the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect. #8221; But it fell to Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016 when nearly everyone expected her to win, to be explicit about a fear that will animate Democratic activism between now and Election Day.  #8220;For four years, #8221; she said,  #8220;people have said to me,  #8216;I didn #8217;t realize how dangerous he was. #8217;  #8216;I wish I could go back and do it over. #8217; Or worst,  #8216;I should have voted. #8217; Well, this can #8217;t be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election. #8221; Obama drove that theme home, too.  #8220;Do not let them take away your power. Don #8217;t let them take away your democracy. #8221; One word summarizes the Democratic mood: urgency."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Give President Trump this much: He has finally realized that the 2020 election will be lost and won in the suburbs. The question is whether his realization comes too late. In recent weeks, Trump claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wants to  #8220;abolish the suburbs, #8221; tweeted that he would preserve the American Dream for  #8220;Suburban Housewives of America #8221; and bragged that his repeal of Obama-era housing regulations intended to prevent segregation would prevent suburbanites from being  #8220;bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood. #8221; It #8217;s another step to stoke racial anxiety, this time among voters who moved leftward in the 2018 midterms and will be crucial in November. Other Republicans have tried it in cycles past. But the scare-the-suburbs tactic has flaws in 2020. First, demographics. These communities are no longer all-White bastions where fathers work and mothers stay home with the children. These neighborhoods are racially diverse: According to a 2018 study, only 68 percent of suburbanites were White, 14 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Black. And no matter where they live, Pew Research Center found that the share of mothers who stay home with children declined from 49 percent in 1967 to 27 percent in 2016. The audience Trump believes he #8217;s targeting  #8212; White stay-at-home suburban moms  #8212; may be smaller than he thinks. Playing the race card is more likely to backfire now than in any time in a generation. In 2019, the libertarian Cato Institute found that 52 percent of Americans who live in the suburbs favor  #8220;building more houses, condos and apartments #8221; in their community while 46 percent oppose the idea. According to YouGov, 50 percent of suburbanites think Biden would be better at handling race relations than Trump, and only 28 percent prefer Trump to Biden. And though it #8217;s too early to tell whether this is a fad or a permanent trend, some suburbs may move left as city-dwellers, some of whom fear disease, have fled urban covid-19 hotspots. Finally, Trump #8217;s suburban pitch is off-key in an election dominated by the coronavirus. According to Gallup #8217;s long-running  #8220;Most Important Problem #8221; survey, concern about economic issues is at an all-time low, despite the economic impact of the pandemic. As of August, a 35 percent plurality thought that  #8220;coronavirus/diseases #8221; was the most important problem facing the country, 22 percent believed it to be  #8220;the government/poor leadership, #8221; and 10 percent named  #8220;race relations/racism #8221; as most pressing. With voting set to begin in a few weeks, Trump #8217;s handling of the virus and the broader recession are more important to voters than the specifics of housing policy. It #8217;s understandable that Trump would want to shift the narrative away from the virus  #8212; less than 40 percent of Americans approve of how Trump has handled the pandemic. And it makes sense to target the suburbs. Voters there make up roughly half of the electorate, and many still remember pulling the lever for tax-cutting Republicans since 2000. Trump needs votes and he needs them quickly, so he is playing on suburban voters #8217; basest fears to win back former Republicans and overcome Biden #8217;s strength in cities. But Trump may discover that, with kids going back to schools and colleges, voters in the suburbs have far too many other fears to worry about the homogeneity of their neighborhoods."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Republican Party #8217;s task this week will be to turn Joe Biden into something he #8217;s not and transform President Trump #8217;s failures into successes. If a political consultants #8217; Olympics gave marks for degrees of difficulty, this event would set a record. No wonder several Republican senators are taking a pass on the whole thing. But Democrats are nonetheless wary about what will come their way. The 2016 Trump Convention was a crude production, lacking in star power and uplift. A lot of big-time Republicans also stayed away. Yet it turned out to be a messaging triumph. One of the most vulgar moments was also one of the most effective: Michael Flynn, the soon-to-be-disgraced Trump loyalist, led the crowd in chanting  #8220;Lock her up! #8221; about Hillary Clinton. That it was Flynn, the shortest-lived national security adviser in history, not Clinton, who was convicted of a crime offers little comfort. Trump won the election by discrediting Clinton (with some help from then-FBI Director James B. Comey at the end). Trump won swing states with the ballots of voters who looked askance at both candidates but decided they hated Clinton more. So outside of his political base  #8212; you can expect it will be well attended-to on immigration, guns and abortion  #8212; Trump is not looking for love this week. His primary goal is one Kentucky politics watchers have long ascribed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: The president wants to be the second most loathed person on the ballot come November. He will try to efface Biden #8217;s image of empathy and decency with a ghoulish cartoon sketch of a man under the control of radical forces. By highlighting support for Biden from prominent Republicans, Biden #8217;s lieutenants made Trump #8217;s job more difficult. The Democratic convention was also relentless in portraying the pain and suffering the nation has endured because of Trump #8217;s mishandling of covid-19. And it was just as determined to turn Biden, by virtue of his own trials, generous spirit and thoughtful calm, into the ideal healer.  #8220;I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, #8221; Jill Biden said of her husband,  #8220;he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole. #8221; Triumph over suffering is now etched so deeply into Biden #8217;s public image that Trump will be hard-pressed to undo it. And the president #8217;s efforts to deny the reality of the country #8217;s suffering have tended to backfire, though he will try again to claim that things would have been worse without him. But if there is one pesky polling number for Democrats, it is Trump #8217;s slight advantage on the matter of which candidate will better handle the economy. Here is where his attempt to tie Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) to the  #8220;far left #8221; will do double duty. The obvious Trump play is to social conservative and racial backlash voters. If the Democrats painted an optimistic picture of a country that could achieve racial justice and national unity, Trump will paint a dark caricature (my color choice is not accidental) of a country facing disorder and chaos under the Democrats. He offered a preview in Scranton, Pa., on the last night of the Democratic convention, deploying a strategy of demonizing Democratic cities he #8217;ll never win to shore up his rural vote and scare suburbanites who have strayed to Biden back into his own camp.  #8220;If you want a vision of your life under a Joe Biden presidency, #8221; Trump said,  #8220;imagine the smoldering ruins of Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland and the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago coming to every city and town in America. #8221; American Carnage Redux is one side of the case Trump wants to make. The other is classic Republican propaganda on economics, aimed at more affluent voters, again particularly suburbanites. Attacks on Biden #8217;s nonexistent  #8220;leftism #8221; will be tied to made-up claims that he will boost taxes to confiscatory levels and, in embracing reforms to capitalism, new public programs and bold steps on climate change, will weaken an already ailing economy. This punch has been telegraphed, too.  #8220;You are coming out of a pandemic, a contraction of historic dimensions, and he wants to raise taxes, #8221; White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said of Biden on Fox News earlier this month, predicting that Biden #8217;s clean energy policies would  #8220;crater the economy and the stock market. #8221; Some of this might stick, but the degree of difficulty problem remains. In 2016, Trump was unencumbered by the responsibilities of office. In 2020, he has a dismal record to defend  #8212; or evade. And the nastier his convention #8217;s message becomes, the more he will reinforce the implicit promise of the Democratic convention: of a calm, less divided country that is normal again."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "This time, the false hope started with the president #8217;s press secretary. In a tweet Saturday night, Kayleigh McEnany told the world that Trump would announce  #8220;a major therapeutic breakthrough #8221; on the novel coronavirus at a Sunday evening news conference. As the president took the podium, he echoed McEnany, promising a  #8220;very historic breakthrough  #8230; that will save countless lives. #8221; The truth  #8212; not surprisingly  #8212; was different: Trump did not announce any breakthrough vaccine or miracle cure, but merely an emergency-use authorization for convalescent plasma, which, while promising, is neither a sure thing nor a breakthrough. Contrary to Trump #8217;s assurances, the treatment, which uses antibody-rich plasma donated by covid-19 survivors, has not been proven to reduce mortality. Just a few weeks ago, according to the New York Times,  #8220;top federal health officials including Dr. Francis S. Collins and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci intervened #8221; to delay the emergency authorization because of concerns that the data on plasma #8217;s effectiveness was too weak. Even if it does work, the treatment is already widely available, so any gains from Trump #8217;s emergency authorization will be  #8220;incremental, #8221; according to former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb. These facts didn #8217;t stop Trump from taking credit, nor from congratulating the FDA, which  #8220;really stepped up, #8221; according to the president. It was a far cry from Saturday morning, when Trump accused  #8220;the deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA #8221; of deliberately delaying vaccines and therapeutics until after Election Day  #8212; making clear, as if there were any doubt, that the president had been wielding this latest conspiracy theory only for his own political reasons. That #8217;s par for the course for this president, of course, who loves few things more than playing games with conspiracy theories. On Thursday, Trump told Fox News #8217;s Sean Hannity that  #8220;we #8217;re going to have sheriffs, and we #8217;re going to have law enforcement #8221; at polling places to combat voter fraud. When critics pointed out that federal law enforcement at the polls would intimidate voters and would be likely to violate the law, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows pretended that  #8220;what the president was really addressing was to make sure that if you want to show up and vote in person, we #8217;re going to make sure that that is safe. #8221; Sure. But it #8217;s all empty posturing anyway: Even acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf  #8212; who had no qualms about sending federal law enforcement in unmarked vehicles to Portland  #8212; agreed Sunday that the department doesn #8217;t have the authority to deploy officers to polling places. Another wink to conspiracy theories came Wednesday, when Trump was asked about the QAnon movement, which believes Trump is fighting a worldwide cabal of Satan-worshippers, sex traffickers, pedophiles and/or cannibals. Rather than debunk the movement, as any normal president would do, Trump claimed,  #8220;I don #8217;t know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much. #8221; It #8217;s nigh impossible that the cable-news-obsessed Trump is actually ignorant of QAnon. Worse, his refusal to disavow it has only bolstered adherents, who have been linked to arson, assault and even murder. But they vote for Trump, and in the president #8217;s mind that, well, trumps all. Still, as scary as these indulgences of conspiracy theories are, nothing is more dangerous in this moment than false hope. Convalescent plasma is just the latest case of Trump promising breakthroughs or downplaying the threat. First came weeks of promises that  #8220;it #8217;s going to work out fine #8221; and  #8220;the coronavirus is very much under control. #8221; Then came months of touting so-called cures such as hydroxycholoroquine. And then came claim after claim that conditions were safe for states and businesses to reopen. The costs of stoking these false hopes are most obvious in the millions who have become sick or died after foolish reopenings. On top of that, though, must be added the confusion wrought by the president #8217;s repeated misstatements, the loss of confidence in experts whose advice the president rejects and the demoralization of millions who thought, based on the president #8217;s word, that happier times were just around the corner, only to have the rug pulled out from under them. In offering more false hope on the eve of the convention renominating him for president, Trump gave us the best reminder why doing so is such a grave mistake."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "For weeks, we #8217;ve been talking about vote-by-mail in the context of November #8217;s presidential election. For good reason: President Trump has openly said he will dismiss a losing result as fraudulent because of to mail-in balloting, and has telegraphed his intention to use delayed delivery of mail ballots to argue that millions of votes still uncounted on Election Day are illegitimate. But what if Trump #8217;s ongoing attacks on vote-by-mail could also help Republicans prevent Democrats from taking control of the Senate, too? This possibility is thrust upon us by the news that two Democratic Super PACs have just launched a massive new campaign to educate Americans about voting by mail. CNN reports: - Two Democratic super PACs are launching a $7.5 million advertising campaign on Monday to encourage voters to request mail-in ballots in several states crucial to their party's hopes of winning the White House and flipping control of the Senate. - The new campaign by Priorities USA Action and the Senate Majority PAC, reported first by CNN, marks the first major advertising push by these deep-pocketed groups to encourage Democratic voters to cast mail-in ballots and is part of a larger, multi-pronged vote-by-mail messaging effort by Democrats in the run-up to Election Day. It #8217;s notable that one of the two groups behind this effort is devoted to helping Democrats win the Senate. While everyone is focused on how Trump #8217;s efforts to corrupt vote-by-mail  #8212; and how Postmaster General Louis DeJoy #8217;s agenda, which has led to widespread mail delays  #8212; will impact the presidential race, they could also impact the battle for the Senate, at a time when Democrats appear to have a genuine chance of flipping the upper chamber. As CNN reports: - The new Democratic ads, which will run in Arizona, Florida, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, will target people who have a history of only voting in person, new voters and voters of color. Much of the advertising will appear on Facebook and Instagram with the goal of reassuring voters that mail-in voting is safe, Priorities officials said. - The ads also drive viewers to sites with specific instructions on how to request a mail-in ballots in voters #8217; individual states. Note that the ads are airing in Maine (which isn #8217;t contested on the presidential level, but is on the Senate level) and in North Carolina, which is tougher for Joe Biden to flip but where the Democrats have a decent chance of flipping another Senate seat. In fact, winning those two seats would go a long way toward boosting Democratic hopes of winning control of the Senate. Also note that the ads are airing in Arizona and Michigan, which are home to critical Senate contests, as well. And given that the new ads have a heavy voter-education component, it #8217;s clear that operatives believe getting voters to navigate vote-by-mail successfully in the face of Trump/GOP efforts to corrupt it could impact the Senate battle. Meanwhile, operatives working to elect Democrats to the Senate are also involved in a lawsuit challenging a measure in Iowa that looks designed to make it harder for elections officials to correct voter mistakes that might disqualify mail ballots. Iowa is also home to a hard-fought Senate race, and vote-by-mail could be critical there because it #8217;s home to many rural voters (as is Maine). Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg points out that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell #8217;s hopes of keeping the Senate may turn on small fluctuations in states where the Senate races are very close  #8212; and that such fluctuations could be influenced by the battle over vote-by-mail and other matters.  #8220;States like Georgia, Iowa, Maine and Montana may be decided by 2 to 3 points, so even modest suppression of Democratic votes in these states could keep the Senate in McConnell #8217;s hands, #8221; Rosenberg told me.  #8220;This is no small matter. #8221; Indeed, in all four of those states, the Senate races are currently very close.  #8220;We won #8217;t allow Trump and his administration to undermine the integrity of our elections or put up roadblocks, which is why we #8217;re taking this fight directly to battleground Senate states, #8221; Rachel Irwin, a spokesperson for Senate Majority PAC, adds. The stakes are extremely high in another way. As I #8217;ve reported, Joe Biden #8217;s advisers believe Trump #8217;s attacks on vote-by-mail as fraudulent are not just about laying the groundwork to declare an election loss illegitimate, but also designed to get voters to conclude that their own mail ballots won #8217;t be counted. This might dissuade them from using vote-by-mail at all, so fewer Democrats vote amid pandemic conditions. Such a dissuasion of mail voting could have an impact in Senate races, as well. And that #8217;s why you #8217;ll also see Democrats involved in the Senate races ramping up efforts to educate voters in the face of Trumpian disinformation about vote-by-mail between now and Election Day. It isn #8217;t just the White House that #8217;s at stake."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Convention week got off to a miserable start for Republicans. I don #8217;t just refer to the whiny first appearance by President Trump, who launched a rambling, incoherent and fact-free rant on Monday, wherein he lied by saying  #8220;They #8217;re trying to steal the election from Republicans. Just like they did it last time, with spying. #8221; (This is, of course, based on the crazy, false allegation that the Obama administration  #8220;spied on him. #8221;) The bad-news avalanche started even before the Republican National Convention roll call #8217;s resembling a hostage video  #8212; a far cry from the uplifting video trip around the country put on by the Democrats last week. And, yes, it started before Vice President Pence hilariously promised to  #8220;Make America Great Again, again #8221; (because they sure have wrecked things since 2016?). For starters, Trump is deeply unpopular. A new Associated Press-NORC poll shows his approval down to a paltry 35 percent, and approval for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic even worse at 31 percent. While the president repeatedly hypes a phony figure of more than 90 percent approval among Republicans, this poll pegs it at a mediocre 79 percent. Moreover, the poll found that  #8220;just 23% think the country is heading in the right direction, while 75% think it #8217;s on the wrong path. . . . The federal government as a whole has also taken a hit with the public, with approval down from 38% in March to 23% now. #8221; For a party banking on a cult of personality, it might want to find a more popular personality. Moreover, the sleaziness of the Trump world is on full display. Last week, former Trump campaign strategist Stephen K. Bannon was arrested on charges of defrauding Americans in connection with a private build-the-wall scheme (Bannon has pleaded not guilty). We then learned of yet another investigation into Trump #8217;s finances. The Post reports that New York Attorney General Letitia James  #8220;is investigating whether President Trump #8217;s company misled lenders and taxing authorities by improperly inflating the value of his assets, according to a court filing on Monday. #8221; James #8217;s investigators are looking into  #8220;Statements of Financial Condition #8221; that Trump sent to lenders in summarizing his assets and debts and have tried to subpoena Trump #8217;s son Eric Trump, who has refused to show up. More from The Post:  #8220;  #8216;The Trump Organization has stalled, withheld documents, and instructed witnesses, including Eric Trump, to refuse to answer questions under oath, #8217; James wrote on Twitter.  #8216;That #8217;s why we filed a motion to compel the Trump Organization to comply with our lawful subpoenas for documents and testimony. #8217;  #8221; Eric Trump is scheduled to speak Tuesday at the Republican convention. The Post reports that implicated in this investigation are three Trump properties: a golf course in Los Angeles, an office building on Wall Street in Manhattan and a country estate known as Seven Springs in Westchester County, N.Y. The charges appear to stem from his former attorney Michael Cohen #8217;s allegations that Trump provided phony evaluations of properties. The Trump Organization #8217;s chief legal officer, Alan Garten, said in a statement that  #8220;The Trump Organization has done nothing wrong. #8221; This is separate, presumably, from yet another investigation overseen by New York City District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. Meanwhile, Trump is increasingly isolated. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway is departing (she says to attend to her family), and a tape of Trump #8217;s sister attesting to Trump #8217;s untrustworthiness and cruelty has emerged. (His niece, Mary Trump, similarly released a tell-all book in an effort to warn Americans not to reelect a narcissistic and toxic personality such as Trump.) More than 20 former Republican officeholders have signaled their support for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, while former Arizona senator Jeff Flake, a rock-ribbed Republican, spoke eloquently as to how Trump has trashed conservative ideals and why he now supports Biden: - t was the honor of my life to represent my state, Arizona  #8211; in the United States House and Senate for eighteen years as a conservative. I'm here to talk about the future  #8211; both of my party, but more importantly, the future of our country: https://t.co/pxBUFqj9jA  #8212; Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) August 24, 2020 One thing Flake did not mention was the deterioration in the GOP #8217;s adherence to supposed  #8220;family values. #8221; With the resignation from Liberty University of Jerry Falwell Jr., an early Trump supporter, as the result of a sex scandal, we are once more reminded that the GOP really does not stand for much of anything. To sum up, the Republican Party has dropped any pretense of a policy platform, throwing its lot in with a racist, xenophobic and compulsively dishonest man who creates chaos and dysfunction and is the subject of multiple investigations relating to his finances. Many decent Republicans are abandoning him in favor of his opponent. This is not five-dimensional chess. It #8217;s a multicar pile-up."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Media analysis of the first night of the out-of-body-experience Republican National Convention tended to praise former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). This tells us more about the media than their performances, standing as a self-indictment of the media #8217;s addiction to  #8220;balance #8221; that drives them to portray Republicans as more sane and decent than they are. Pundits praised Scott and Haley because they did not scream like other speakers, wink at white supremacy or venerate President Trump. Speaking in an inside voice, eschewing racist appeals and declining to slobber over a U.S. president  #8212; in such extreme terms that even Kim Jong Un might say,  #8220;Tone it down, guys #8221;  #8212; do not deserve praise. Indeed, their performances reveal that Scott and Haley, unlike the true believers, might understand Trump is a toxic figure but are willing to enable him and lie on his behalf. Their sanity makes their falsehoods and denials even worse. Haley repeated untrue talking points. She said Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wants to ban fracking. (He does not.) And her use of the quote from then-U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick that "Democrats always blame America first #8221; in foreign policy was blatant nonsense; Democrats blame Russia, unlike Trump, and they blame a president who egregiously violated his oath. You see, Trump is not the same as  #8220;America, #8221; which might escape notice in the cult. Haley repeated the lie that the Obama administration sent cash to Iran; instead, it unfroze assets that Iran owned. Trump did not get tough on North Korea, as she claimed; Trump gave its dictator multiple, stomach-turning PR coups while ignoring his human rights atrocities. And while she didn #8217;t call Biden a socialist, she made it sound as if he were a card-carrying member of the cabal of  #8220;Pelosi, Sanders and the Squad. #8221; This is blather you would hear on Fox News. It was downright embarrassing when she could not even perform a humble brag for removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds as governor.  #8220;Together we made the hard choices needed to heal, and removed a divisive symbol peacefully and respectfully, #8221; she said. Perhaps she could not explain what that symbol is because Trump and his cult have defended the Confederate flag, a symbol of white supremacy. So what is Haley doing? She knows about Trump #8217;s grotesque record on human rights, his efforts to sabotage NATO and his extortion of Ukraine and Syria (abandoning the Kurds), yet she cheers him on. She cares so little for the principles she espouses that she will enable someone who betrays America and wants to destroy even the sanctity of elections. No one made her show up. Her dishonesty, low regard for the American people #8217;s intelligence and lack of moral spine should not earn her brownie points. It deserves our scorn. Scott #8217;s address was even more galling since he has, at times, criticized Trump #8217;s racism (including Trump #8217;s statement that there were  #8220;very fine #8221; people on both sides of the Charlottesville rally) and watched his party deny systemic racism in America and decline to support real police reform. He chose to obscure who was responsible for Trump-abetted calamities.  #8220;From a global pandemic, to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, 2020 has tested our nation in ways we haven #8217;t seen for decades, #8221; he said. So how did Trump do? Scott seems to pretend the election is not about Trump and Biden, hiding behind principles Trump rejects such as inclusiveness. He also falsely said the tax cuts did not diminish revenue. Adjusted for inflation and growth, they most certainly did. Laughably, Scott argued that Trump had made the economy more inclusive. In 2019, Politico reported:  #8220;Income inequality has reached its highest level in at least 50 years, according to new U.S. government data released today, underscoring a key theme for Democratic candidates hoping to unseat President Donald Trump. #8221; Blacks #8217; wealth compared with Whites has gone down, not up. And as Steve Rattner, former car czar in the Obama administration, recently explained in a New York Times op-ed:  #8220;By almost every metric, Black Americans have fared far worse than whites, including higher rates of closure of Black-owned businesses. And that #8217;s after struggling under the Trump administration since long before the virus hit  #8212; Black median household incomes, which were 66.5 percent of those of white households in 2016, had dropped to 62.4 percent of the level of white households by 2018. #8221; Again, Scott was not forced to appear. Nevertheless, he came to praise a president who tries to scare White suburbanites with the prospect of Blacks moving into their neighborhoods; does not say the name Breonna Taylor or comment on the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis.; refers to majority-Black nations as  #8220;shithole countries, #8221; calls Mexican immigrants  #8220;criminals" and "rapists #8221;; encourages China to build detention camps for Uighurs; and betrayed his country by seeking to extort an ally in a war against Russia. What does it say about Scott that he would defend an overt racist and admirer of dictators? It says he either is blinded by the right-wing propaganda machine or, just like Trump, is willing to look Americans in the eye and lie. This, too, is unworthy of praise."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "When the United States hosts foreign leaders and dignitaries, a little-known office at the State Department is in charge of sweating every detail, from choreographing presidential handshakes to arranging seating charts to managing dietary restrictions. The Office of the Chief of Protocol oversees the glitz and glamour of diplomacy, and is responsible for enforcing the rules of decorum to maintain tradition and tee up U.S. negotiators for success. But inside that office, U.S. employees have complained about internal breaches in etiquette and protocol under the leadership of the Trump administration #8217;s political appointees running day-to-day affairs. The complaints resulted in an investigation by the State Department #8217;s in-house watchdog, which in May produced a report saying that the former chief of protocol, Sean Lawler, committed what could be considered  #8220;workplace violence #8221; and that Cam Henderson, the current chief of protocol, and Mary-Kate Fisher, her deputy,  #8220;failed to report #8221; that behavior  #8220;in violation of Department policies. #8221; Officials described an environment of yelling, cursing,  #8220;overconsuming alcohol, #8221; and intimidating and abusive behavior, according to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Post.  #8220;Mr. Lawler had an explosive personality and regularly would throw papers and binders, #8221; the report said of his tenure from December 2017 to July 2019.  #8220;Several employees reported that he would crack a horse whip in the office and that, given his general demeanor and conduct, these actions placed them in fear of physical harm. #8221; State Department officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said Lawler routinely made abusive, homophobic and culturally insensitive comments to his subordinates. The leadership of the State Department strongly rejected the findings of the report and questioned the motives of the watchdog, which it says demonstrated a  #8220;systemic pattern of selective inclusion and exclusion of facts. #8221; The State Department #8217;s June 30 response, which The Post obtained, is the latest sign of bad blood between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the office of the inspector general, which is responsible for investigating suspected waste, fraud and malfeasance at the department. Pompeo orchestrated the ouster of Steve Linick, the department #8217;s previous inspector general, in the spring, but Linick #8217;s investigations are continuing to be pursued by his successors. The leadership #8217;s response was addressed to Linick #8217;s replacement, Stephen Akard, who abruptly resigned this month after less than three months on the job. Akard had been under pressure from Democratic lawmakers to recuse himself from investigations of whether Pompeo and his wife, Susan, inappropriately used federal resources. Pompeo has denied the allegations. Akard was replaced by Diana R. Shaw, his deputy. The watchdog report says it is based on accounts from  #8220;numerous #8221; officials and took into account other internal investigations by the Office of Civil Rights and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. It also notes that some of the abusive incidents were relayed in  #8220;general terms #8221; to protect the identity of officials who  #8220;expressed a fear of retaliation. #8221; Elements of the document were first reported by Politico earlier this month. When asked about the charges, Lawler told The Post that they were  #8220;ridiculously offensive and untrue. #8221; He declined to respond in detail to the various allegations. A State Department spokesperson added that it is  #8220;outrageous that a memo on personnel matters which makes unsubstantiated accusations has been leaked to the press. #8221; Public awareness of problems at the Protocol Office emerged in June of last year after Lawler was suspended amid complaints about harassment, including accounts that he carried a whip around the office. The report sheds new light on a variety of unusual events that took place at the Protocol Office. The whip, for instance, was  #8220;gifted #8221; to Lawler by a delegation visiting from Kazakhstan, according to the response from Henderson and Fisher, who called it a  #8220;riding crop. #8221;  #8220;There was a verbal complaint from a staff member about this riding crop, directed to Ms. Henderson, who responded by moving the riding crop into her office for safekeeping and informing Ambassador Lawler he should no longer carry the riding crop on his person for any reason, #8221; the response says. The Protocol Office is home to an influential group of former aides to ex-New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R). Henderson and Fisher worked for Christie, who endorsed Donald Trump at a pivotal moment in the 2016 presidential race. Officials told The Post that Lawler picked on gay employees and made them feel disrespected. Two State Department officials said Lawler referred to one gay subordinate named Kyle as  #8220;Kylie. #8221; The officials also noted that Lawler said that a group of visiting Japanese diplomats  #8220;looked like gay porn stars #8221; and that he thought he was getting  #8220;hit on #8221; and didn #8217;t want their gifts. Officials alleged that Lawler made other offensive comments. After a group of Turkish nationals visited the Protocol Office and offered a gift of dates, according to an official, Lawler said the dates were  #8220;disgusting, #8221; just like the  #8220;dirty #8221; men who had brought them."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "A slew of Democrats, independents and disaffected Republicans have, almost tearfully, taken to social media to plead their case: Do I have to watch the RNC? The answer is no, and you don #8217;t even have to feel guilty about it. Let #8217;s begin with the notion that you should listen to the arguments of your ideological opponents. Well, that is a good idea, but that does not mean one must endure screaming, dog whistles and bullhorn appeals to White supremacy and abjectly ridiculous accusations ( #8220;Joe Biden will destroy the suburbs! #8221;  #8220;Biden is a socialist! #8221;). There is no agenda (just defend Trump, the RNC #8217;s platform says); thus, there are no arguments in defense of President Trump #8217;s nonexistent policies. Moreover, you need not endure an hour or more each night of straight bile when responsible news outlets can give you the recap. Moreover, there is something to be said for self-care in the Trump era. We have become numb after four years or so of lies, racism, xenophobia, narcissism and cruelty. You have to wonder if less consumption of President Trump and his cultists would help put his most egregious remarks in perspective. If you ever found yourself at the end of a week  #8212; or even a day  #8212; experiencing difficulty recalling the third- or fourth-most-recent outrage, you understand how more exposure does not necessarily make you more cognizant of the lying, norm-breaking, meanness and bigotry. The sheer quantity of his lies, outrages and attacks makes it all a blur. (Remember when he commuted Roger Stone #8217;s sentence? That was only last month.) There is a wealth of research out there that frequent exposure to hate speech (what else would you call Trump #8217;s racist appeals and personal attacks?) makes us, as one paper from 2017 put it,  #8220;less sensitive to hate speech and more prejudiced toward hate speech victims than their counterparts in the control condition. #8221; Richard A. Friedman, a psychiatrist, wrote in 2018 that  #8220;politicians like Mr. Trump who stoke anger and fear in their supporters provoke a surge of stress hormones, like cortisol and norepinephrine, and engage the amygdala, the brain center for threat. #8221; He continued:  #8220;One study, for example, that focused on  #8216;the processing of danger #8217; showed that threatening language can directly activate the amygdala. This makes it hard for people to dial down their emotions and think before they act. #8221; In layman #8217;s terms: All that anger and fear can make you less rational. And do not worry that you are missing out on what others are absorbing.  #8220;The first night of the Republican National Convention averaged 17 million viewers on Monday, a sharp drop of 26% from 2016, #8221; the Los Angeles Times reported.  #8220;The audience figure from Nielsen was also below the opening night of last week #8217;s Democratic National Convention, which averaged 19.7 million viewers #8221; over the three major English language broadcast networks and three leading cable news channels. Relatively few people, it turns out, want to subject themselves to monotonous speeches delivered at high decibels. There is nothing new here  #8212; no surprise or metamorphosis in the GOP #8217;s thinking. Pace yourself: You #8217;ll need to husband all that emotional ballast for November, when Trump inevitably refuses to accept the result of the election."</TEXT>

He pointed out that people keep asking BLM to follow the rules and not break any laws. He asked, "And how's that been working for them over the years?" Laws are a social contract, but the social contract has been consistently failing them. So, if they do nothing illegal, they get shot, they get profiled, they get discriminated against.

    <TEXT>TEXT: "While the national media debates whether Americans care about the Hatch Act (Hint: It doesn #8217;t matter; journalists #8217; task is to inform the public), the gap between Republicans and reality widens. The Republican National Convention is attempting to convince us that President Trump has heroically addressed the coronavirus pandemic, outdone President Barack Obama on the economy, cares about immigrants and leads a party that is welcoming to Blacks. In the real world, the pandemic is still out of control, much of the economy and many schools remains shuttered, and anti-Black and anti-immigrant sentiment is rising. Only one presidential candidate is deploring another shooting of an unarmed Black American and denouncing violence: [video of Biden denouncing violence and looting.] Meanwhile, Trump sounds the law-and-order horn (despite a slew of his own aides arrested or convicted of crimes, a bonanza of Hatch Act violations, an incitement for cops to mistreat suspects and multiple investigations into Trump #8217;s own finances). He blames racial violence in our cities on liberals and Black Lives Matter protesters. In fact, we should look to systemic racism and police indifference. The Associated Press reports: - A white, 17-year-old police admirer was arrested Wednesday after two people were shot to death during a third straight night of protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake. - Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha. . . . - According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder with his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people. Rittenhouse #8217;s social media entries feature  #8220;Blue Lives Matter #8221; tributes, the slogan Republicans widely use to rebut efforts to focus on the plague of killings of Black men. Police at the protests also seem to have encouraged armed vigilantes. The Associated Press reports:  #8220;Video taken before the shooting showed police tossing bottled water from an armored vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. And one of them appears to be the gunman.  #8216;We appreciate you being here, #8217; an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker. #8221; What is striking about the dishonest messaging from Trump and his fellow Republicans, which has surely fueled this atmosphere, is that the media #8217;s focus has been on whether it will work or convince voters. There are two problems with such takes. First, the answers are unknowable. There is no polling which tells us one way or another. However, the focus on these questions makes politics into a value-free, fact-free game. The message to voters implicitly says that what matters in politics is whether a candidate #8217;s message resonates with his or her base. Instead, the focus should be on what is happening in the country (e.g., a Category 4 hurricane bearing down on the Gulf Coast with no mention from the president, a pandemic out of control, another example of systemic racism in policing) and the abject dishonesty of a party unwilling to accept reality or responsibility. Second, the media ignores the degree to which Republicans contribute to racial injustice by refusing to acknowledge it exists. Robert P. Jones of PRRI explains: Messaging from the Republican convention is clearly an effort to capitalize on racial violence. After all the protests, all the heartfelt efforts to diversify newsrooms to improve coverage and the deaths of so many Black Americans, how is it possible that the coverage is so frivolous and the lack of accountability so great? While the Republican convention has given Jacob Blake #8217;s shooting short shrift, the National Basketball Association postponed Wednesday #8217;s schedule of playoff games after Milwaukee Bucks team members refused to take the court for their game earlier in the afternoon. Maybe the NBA can give the event the attention it deserves. We face the most consequential election in our lifetimes. One party is brazenly displaying its ability to bamboozle its base. It behooves the rest of us not to praise their ingenuity, but to refocus on the three major crises we face: a health crisis unprecedented over the last 100 years, an economic collapse equivalent to the Great Depression, and a spate of racial violence against unarmed Black people, each of which the sitting president waves off while spinning a false narrative of Democrats #8217;  #8220;socialism #8221; and indifference to violence."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "None of Republicans #8217; commonly deployed arguments for reelecting President Trump are tethered to reality. The paucity of logic and factual support for their rationales suggests many on the right, even  #8220;respectable #8221; columnists and elected officials, actually support him for reasons they #8217;re loath to admit, whether it #8217;s because they share his apocalyptic view of crime encroaching on the suburbs or are eager to see a country purged of immigrants. He will give us law and order: If public safety is the concern, the unnecessary deaths from covid-19, which might exceed 200,000 by Election Day, and the anxiety over leaving our homes for fear of joining 6 million infected Americans surely make Trump #8217;s tenure the most dangerous for ordinary Americans. Each week, we have been losing twice the number of Americans killed on Sept. 11. No wonder Trump loves to highlight any domestic scene of disorder, mayhem and looting he can to frighten White Americans, arguing that if law enforcement  #8220;dominates the streets, #8221; we will have public order. This is preposterous. We cannot go to war with millions of demonstrators. That #8217;s simply impossible, not to mention morally objectionable. The demands of the protesters, among them police reform and voting rights legislation are entirely legitimate. But so long as Trump denies the legitimacy of these concerns and the presence of systemic racism, we will not have domestic tranquility. Trump celebrates violence, encourages police misconduct, honors Whites indicted for brandishing guns at marchers and tear-gassed peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway let on that the administration believes that the more violence happens in the streets, the better chance Trump has of being reelected. Meanwhile, Trump smears our intelligence community, spinning false conspiracy theories and adopting Vladimir Putin #8217;s version of the 2016 plot to interfere with our election. Trump tramples on laws and precedents ranging from the Hatch Act to turning over his tax returns to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee upon request. There is no president in recent memory who has hired and associated with so many convicted felons. He personally is under investigation by multiple authorities for potential financial crimes. He is his own crime spree. As President Trump threatens to unleash the military on American cities roiled in civil unrest, it's clear that he's embracing his inner Nixon. (Joshua Carroll, Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post) He has vanquished the pandemic: The level of delusion necessary to sustain the fiction that Trump has handled the pandemic well is unfathomable. We have more deaths due to the disease than any other country on the planet, many more deaths per capita than many advanced countries and no national testing-and-tracing program. We remain cloistered at home and children cannot attend school in person in most places after weeks of shutdowns, largely because Trumped egged officials into reopening prematurely. He has hawked dangerous and unproven remedies and pressured government health experts to weaken or change guidelines to minimize dangers and restrictions on activities. As he did Thursday night, he gathers large crowds without masks and social distancing, creating his very own potential superspreading events. He has been great for the economy: Multiple fact-checkers have repeatedly demonstrated that the economy under President Barack Obama #8217;s was stronger by multiple measures than the economy under Trump. This disparity was due in part to tariffs Trump imposed, which amount to a tax hike for U.S. consumers. If Trump falsely thinks he inherited a rotten economy, it #8217;s inarguable that it got worse even before he crashed it by attempting to ignore a pandemic. It is now evident that some jobs lost will not return when  #8212; and if  #8212; the coronavirus is vanquished. Hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses have closed. Companies will not all emerge from bankruptcy. Trump ends his four years with record unemployment and debt  #8212; and without a plan to reduce either. Joe Biden is a socialist: Not even the Republicans have the nerve to make that argument. Instead, they argue that Biden will be tricked or led around by the nose by forces on the left. This is entirely speculative and ignores Biden #8217;s decades-long record in office (remember the 1994 crime bill?) and policy choices during the campaign, among them his opposition to Medicare-for-all. Moreover, we have yet to see in American politics a situation in which the wing of a party defeated in the presidential primary magically controls the executive branch after their rivals from the same party assume office. Moreover, if  #8220;conservatives #8221; are worried about the expansion of government, then Trump #8217;s widespread abuse of executive power, meddling in investigations and enforcement actions to benefit cronies and punish enemies, threats to harm certain companies (as in his call for a boycott of Goodyear), protectionism and capitulation to illiberal regimes, as well as the mammoth debt he #8217;s run up, his indiscriminate use of federal forces against protesters, his misuse of government property and government employees to serve his personal interests, and attacks on the courts and free press make Trump the least conservative president ever (if that word has any meaning anymore).  #8220;Life #8221;: One can respect those deeply opposed to abortion in evaluating the candidates, but by the same token, a president who prioritizes the economy over preventing a pandemic, rips children from the arms of their mothers, refuses to denounce killings of unarmed Black Americans and willfully declines to protect the lives of our troops on whose heads Russia placed bounties is not respectful of human life in any meaningful sense. Indeed, Trump has turned the party into a vicious death cult that trivializes the nearly 180,000 deaths caused by covid-19 to date. When you create superspreader crowds to soothe your ego, you are endangering human life. When one party willfully ignores a pandemic and treats Black lives as expendable, it loses any moral authority regarding the sanctity of human life. In refusing to be guided by scientific facts (be it on air and water quality, climate change or covid-19), Trump puts at risk the health and lives of millions of people."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So by your definition, anyone who has been killed is a lawbreaker, and has it coming, regardless of the circumstances. Well-trained cops and soldiers disagree. They are taught to de-escalate, not simply shoot. And people like the 17-year-old have no business (and no right) to go looking for trouble with an AR-15. Also, according to the FBI, the violence has come from right-wingers and anarchists, not BLM or even Antifa. Pence implied an Oakland cop was shot by the left, but a boogaloo has been charged. In this case, the 17-year-old was befriended by the cops, despite having an AR-15 and being out after curfew. But we've regularly seen cops pepper-spray and use rubber bullets on peaceful, unarmed protesters who weren't breaking any laws. You're just cool with it because they favor your side. It would be interesting to see your reaction if they starting treating MAGA people that way. Principles matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (shortened for length): "When a Republican-led Senate committee issued a nearly 1,000-page report in mid-August that detailed the prodigious extent of the contacts between Russian officials and members of Donald Trump #8217;s 2016 campaign team, it felt a bit like a dispatch from a vaguely familiar reality  #8212; a prepandemic realm when we could mostly agree to focus on foreign interference in American democracy, and when the Trump presidency felt as if it were hanging in the balance while it awaited word from Robert S. Mueller III. This is the world that forged Michael S. Schmidt #8217;s  #8220;Donald Trump v. the United States. #8221; It vividly resurrects that actually-not-so-distant era by unspooling the occasionally staggering stories of two administration figures who were central to the investigative sagas that dominated the early Trump years, largely thanks to their attempts to constrain him. The subjects are both all too familiar and, Schmidt implies, underappreciated in their significance in shaping Trump #8217;s presidency. Schmidt recounts with unsparing intimacy James Comey #8217;s arc from the 2016 election to his 2017 firing from the F.B.I. directorship, and he documents the relentlessly uncomfortable White House tenure of the former general counsel Donald F. McGahn II, who, he points out,  #8220;was in charge of Trump #8217;s greatest political accomplishment, and he found himself caught up as the chief witness against Trump. #8221; The result is a revelatory portrait of the events that led to the investigation of Trump for obstruction of justice, and his repeated attempts to control the Department of Justice. It is not about the alleged collusion with Moscow, and in fact Schmidt reports that Mueller #8217;s investigators  #8220;never undertook a significant examination of Trump #8217;s personal and business ties to Russia, #8221; largely thanks to the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein #8217;s intervention. Schmidt, a New York Times correspondent in Washington who was part of two teams that won Pulitzer Prizes in 2018, including one for coverage of Trump #8217;s Russian-inflected scandals, portrays an administration in which all aides may as well always have a resignation letter ready as a safeguard against an angry, flailing president detached from commonly accepted reality. This is a meticulously reported volume that clearly benefits from the author #8217;s extraordinary access to many of the relevant characters, but also from his subjects #8217; tendency to record, in detail, their time around Trump. Whereas recent years have been packed with high-impact reported books about Trump #8217;s erratic behavior and his administration #8217;s backbiting  #8212; Bob Woodward #8217;s  #8220;Fear, #8221; Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig #8217;s  #8220;A Very Stable Genius #8221; and Jonathan Karl #8217;s  #8220;Front Row at the Trump Show #8221; come to mind  #8212;  #8220;Donald Trump v. the United States #8221; is more closely tailored to the efforts to rein Trump in. As such, it may be unlikely to become a go-to for general conclusions about Trump #8217;s character. But it adds significantly to the public understanding of the Mueller investigation and Trump #8217;s war against it. The narrative is sometimes cinematic. It opens with Schmidt chasing down McGahn outside the White House #8217;s front gates and eventually getting him to concede,  #8220;I damaged the office of the president; I damaged the office. #8221; It #8217;s a breathtakingly revealing admission from the White House #8217;s chief lawyer and the architect of Trump #8217;s effort to appoint as many conservative judges as possible. (Schmidt says,  #8220;I thought he was still understating the gravity of what he had done. #8221;) McGahn, a staunch libertarian, was frequently in over his head with the lawless president he nicknamed  #8220;King Kong, #8221; and he struggled with his highly unusual extended contact with Mueller #8217;s team. Still, despite getting close to resigning, McGahn stuck around far longer than his apparent misery and frequent attempts at principled stands would suggest, largely because of his judicial project #8217;s success. It was only after Trump granted a woman clemency at Kim Kardashian #8217;s request that McGahn knew he truly had to leave the White House. He could no longer abide the accumulation of Trump #8217;s actions. Then, in the annals of unsustainable relationships with Trump, there #8217;s James Comey. His early interactions with the president, like the one-on-one dinner at which Trump requested Comey #8217;s loyalty, have been described repeatedly. But in Schmidt #8217;s granular telling, the relationship was especially agonizing because of a fundamental disconnect between the two men. Comey was always deeply interested in maintaining his and his agency #8217;s public credibility  #8212; especially after his wildly controversial intrusions into the 2016 campaign over Hillary Clinton #8217;s emails. After he was fired by Trump, he text-messaged a friend:  #8220;I #8217;m with my peeps (former peeps). They are broken up and I #8217;m sitting with them like a wake. Trying to figure out how to get back home. May hitchhike. #8221; It #8217;s just one example of the clearly extensive access Schmidt had to Comey and his wife.  #8220;Donald Trump v. the United States #8221; is full of gritty details about what it #8217;s like for a plugged-in journalist to report on Trump #8217;s intrigue, ranging from the time Schmidt shepherded a valued source to and from the airport, to his learning, secondhand, about a Justice Department official soliciting dirt on Comey at a Cinco de Mayo party. At one point, Schmidt writes, he shattered his cellphone and didn #8217;t fix it for a week because there was too much news; he ended up with pieces of glass in his hands. More interesting, however, is the constant flow of shocking anecdotes: Schmidt writes that Mitch McConnell fell asleep during a classified briefing on Russia, for example, and he details the F.B.I. #8217;s shambolic reaction to evidence of the hacking in 2016, including an unresolved disagreement over how to handle the material. Describing Trump #8217;s unexpected November 2019 visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he reports the White House wanted Mike Pence  #8220;on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized. #8221; (The vice president never had to take this step.)"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "It is entirely fitting that Donald Trump  #8212; the least law-abiding president in our history  #8212; was renominated at a convention that was itself a seeming cavalcade of crime. Every night featured apparent violations of the 1939 Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities  #8220;in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties by an individual employed or holding office in the Government of the United States. #8221; The White House certainly qualifies as such a facility. Yet Trump used it as a convention prop, even going so far as to televise a naturalization ceremony for immigrants  #8212; some of whom did not realize they would be shown at the Republican convention  #8212; as part of the nightly show. Trump not only flouted the law but also reveled in doing so. During his acceptance speech, he boasted,  #8220;We #8217;re here  #8212; they #8217;re not, #8221; and the New York Times reported that Trump  #8220;relished the fact that no one could do anything to stop him. #8221; While the president is exempt from the civil provisions of the Hatch Act, he could be subject, once he leaves office, to criminal penalties if he should  #8220;intimidate, threaten, command, or coerce  #8230; any employee of the Federal Government  #8230; to engage in  #8230; any political activity. #8221; That is a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. This is, of course, barely scratching the surface of an administration that should more accurately be described as an ongoing criminal conspiracy. While many of Trump #8217;s awful acts  #8212; e.g., confining children in cages or unleashing riot police on peaceful protesters  #8212; are merely violations of democratic norms, there is also plentiful evidence of lawbreaking on his part. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has identified Trump as  #8220;Individual-1 #8221; in a conspiracy with his attorney Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by secretly paying off two women with whom he allegedly had affairs. Cohen went to prison; Trump, who as president claims immunity from prosecution, wasn #8217;t indicted. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III uncovered a great deal more potential illegality. He found 10 instances when Trump might have obstructed justice, and in at least four of those cases he found evidence that Trump #8217;s conduct met all three elements of the obstruction-of-justice statute. Each violation carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The recent report from the Senate Intelligence Committee suggests that Trump also lied to Mueller when, in written testimony, he claimed not to remember speaking to Roger Stone about WikiLeaks. If he committed perjury, that would subject him to up to five years #8217; imprisonment. Trump #8217;s impeachment, on charges of trying to extort Ukraine into helping him politically, uncovered more conduct that could be criminal. Just Security published an invaluable compendium written by eminent legal experts who argued that Trump might have broken federal campaign finance laws (he solicited something of value from a foreign national), bribery laws, the  #8220;honest services #8221; law ( #8220;a public official breaches his duty to act in the best interests of his constituents by performing an official acting in exchange for personal gain #8221;), the contempt-of-Congress law  #8212; and, yet again, the Hatch Act, which prohibits a public official from using  #8220;official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election. #8221; Then there all the financial crimes Trump might be hiding by refusing to release his tax returns and other financial documents. The Manhattan district attorney and the New York attorney general are said to be investigating Trump for potential campaign finance violations, bank fraud and tax fraud. The question is: Who will investigate Trump #8217;s potentially illegal conduct while in office  #8212; and prosecute him, if warranted, once he leaves it? We know it won #8217;t be Attorney General William P. Barr, Trump #8217;s accomplice in perverting the Constitution. That means it will be up to Joe Biden, assuming he wins in November. In the past, I would have argued for leaving Trump alone after he steps down so as to end our  #8220;long national nightmare. #8221; But now I am convinced that Trump #8217;s wrongdoing is so pervasive and brazen that he must be prosecuted to uphold the rule of law and deter even greater lawbreaking by future presidents. If elected, President Biden should appoint a special counsel of unimpeachable integrity  #8212; a widely respected former U.S. attorney or federal judge  #8212; with a wide-ranging mandate to investigate Trump and his administration. That prosecutor should finally summon Trump to testify orally under oath or assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination  #8212; something Mueller never did. If Trump did testify, it would almost certainly result in perjury charges. Trump could try to short-circuit justice by trying to pardon himself before he leaves office  #8212; or even by resigning a few hours early and having Vice President Pence sworn in to issue a pardon (as President Gerald Ford did for Richard Nixon). In that case, the special counsel would be limited to investigating Trump #8217;s accomplices (unless they are also pardoned) and helping state prosecutors. But the special counsel should still issue a comprehensive report on Trump #8217;s lawbreaking. We must expose and root out this ethical rot before it eats away at the foundations of our democracy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump, during an interview on Monday with Fox News #8217;s Laura Ingraham, a spin artist for the president and a purveyor of anti-immigrant sentiment, claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is controlled by mysterious people. (Disclaimer: I am an MSNBC contributor.) In concocting his tale, Trump fantasized of  #8220;people that you #8217;ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows. #8221; Ingraham, as though trying her best to stop his self-immolation, responded,  #8220;That sounds like conspiracy theory. #8221; No luck. Trump continued:  #8220;They are people that are on the streets, they #8217;re people that are controlling the streets. We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that. #8221; This is simply bonkers. Ingraham then stopped him from digging himself a deeper hole when he suggested police who kill unarmed people are akin to a golfer missing a three-foot putt.  #8220;But they choke, just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot [putt], #8221; Trump said. Ingraham leaped in:  #8220;You #8217;re not comparing it to golf, because that #8217;s what the media [would say]. #8221; In other words, actual reporters would recognize what he was saying was morally offensive and so lacking in self-awareness as to suggest Trump cannot even fake normal behavior. Trump had no one around him on Tuesday to stage an intervention, so he repeated his gibberish: "A person was on a plane, said there were about six people like that person, more or less, and what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, rioters  #8212; people that were obviously looking for trouble, #8221; Trump insisted.  #8220;And the person felt very uncomfortable on the plane. #8221; He added: "This would be a person you know. So I will see whether or not I can get that person. I #8217;ll let them know, and I can see whether or not I can get that person to speak to you, #8221; he said.  #8220;This was a firsthand account of a plane going from Washington to wherever. #8221;  #8220;Wherever #8221; is the sort of filler you use when your lie becomes too absurd to add anymore detail. The unparalleled Daniel Dale from CNN dubbed Trump #8217;s people-on-the-plane story as  #8220;almost too stupid to fact-check, #8221; before issuing a reminder that Trump is infamous for his unfounded and bizarre conspiracy theories (e.g., former president Barack Obama wasn #8217;t born in America; windmills cause cancer). In a normal time, with a functioning Republican Party and a patriotic vice president, this might be the end of Trump #8217;s campaign and an invitation to invoke the 25th Amendment. We, unfortunately, have spineless sycophants in the GOP and a zombie-like vice president who feels compelled to show allegiance to a president plainly unfit to hold office. Likewise, in most families, there would be a family meeting to stop him from embarrassing himself. (Perhaps not in families where its members stand to inherit millions of dollars.) No chance of that, but the thesis from the president #8217;s niece, Mary Trump, that there is something seriously wrong with him looks pretty unassailable. Surely, some excuse will emerge. Maybe Trump was  #8220;just joking." Maybe Republicans will actually insist the president was telling the truth, making them also sound like they #8217;ve also gone around the bend. The real sin here is the right-wing media that keep protecting Trump, the pundits who will argue it does not matter what he says, and the Republicans too timid to stand up to someone incapable of doing the job. It does not help that the mainstream media pulls its punches. Something is really, really wrong  #8212; and those pretending that it is not are endangering the country and our democracy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The first presidential debate is scheduled to take place in four weeks. Moderators should be preparing themselves to ask President Trump the questions that go to the heart of his ability to do his job  #8212; even if he gets upset, and even though no president has had to answer similar questions before. Here are a few: - There is no scientific evidence windmills cause cancer. Why did you say they do? - You said forces in the  #8220;dark shadows #8221; control your opponent and that a pack of figures in dark clothing with gear were reported on a plane. Is there any factual support for this? What flight were you talking about, and how would anyone know that those people on the plane are out to manipulate the former vice president? - You keep saying President Barack Obama spied on you and your 2016 campaign. The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee said that this is false. No Justice Department investigation has found this. No evidence has been made publicly available. On what basis do you say your predecessor acted illegally? - You said under oath in written answers that you couldn #8217;t remember whether you spoke to others on your 2016 campaign about WikiLeaks #8217;s release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). In fact, Roger Stone spoke to you about the email dump on July 25, 2016, according to the testimony of former campaign adviser Rick Gates. Did you forget this conversation? - There is zero evidence that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election or that the DNC server is there. That claim is Russian propaganda. Why did you repeat these assertions over and over again? - When have you ever publicly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin? Is he a dictator? Does Russia kill journalists and Putin #8217;s opponents? - Why did you want to let Russia back into the Group of Seven; repeat Russian propaganda that the Soviet Union was engaged in a defensive war in Afghanistan in the 1980s; refuse to confront Putin on the evidence of Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers (even after it became public knowledge); and insist you were not briefed on the Russian bounties even though it appeared in your written briefing in late February? - The United States has lost more than 181,000 people to covid-19, more than any country in the world and more than many Western countries on a per-capita basis. No other country has been at least partially shut down or hobbled for six months, or has failed to institute a national testing-and-tracing plan. Was your handling of the virus a  #8220;success #8221;? - When you said the United States had 15 positive cases of the novel coronavirus and then claimed the disease would disappear, you were wrong. Why did you assure Americans the number of cases would soon be  #8220;zero #8221;? - Why do you want to keep the names men who betrayed the United States by taking up arms against the Union during the Civil War on military bases? Do you believe the South fought the Civil War to preserve slavery? Do you disagree that the Confederate flag is meant to lionize those men? - President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Other presidents have appointed Black judges to the Supreme Court or at least to federal appellate courts, which you have not. Other presidents have had multiple African Americans in their Cabinet; you have one. How can you say you did more for Blacks than any other president since Abraham Lincoln? - Why have you not condemned the police shooting of Jacob Blake? Why did you offer a defense of the White man who allegedly killed two people in Kenosha, Wis.? - You said you do not want higher levels of voting. Isn #8217;t that the opposite of democracy? - Before the pandemic hit, the economy under your presidency created fewer jobs on average per month than during the last three years of the Obama administration. All three of his final years in office beat your best year of growth. Why do you say you inherited a bad economy? - You said the economy would grow by 4 percent or more under the 2017 tax cuts and that they would result in no new debt. Neither happened. Why were you so far off in your prediction? - Who pays for tariffs? What is the  #8220;trade deficit #8221;? - You said you would protect people with preexisting conditions, but you are in court seeking to repeal all of Obamacare, including that protection. Can you explain the contradiction? - Why did you unexpectedly go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last November? Why were you administered a basic test for dementia and similar conditions? How many times have you taken such a test? Was Vice President Pence put on alert when you went to Walter Reed? Has any doctor examined you for impaired mental ability or for physical conditions from such impairment?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump, it seems, was counting on the fantasyland production at the White House for the Republican National Convention to change the trajectory of the race. It did not happen, and with less than nine weeks to go before Election Day, and much less before early voting gets underway, the post-convention momentum is going in the other direction. Start with the money. The Biden campaign #8217;s jaw-dropping, unprecedented blizzard of more than $364 million in donations for the month of August  #8212; with 95 percent coming from  #8220;grassroots supporters #8221; (1.5 million of the total 4 million donors gave for the first time last month) and 57 percent coming from online  #8212; gives former vice president Joe Biden all the money he needs for the final stretch."Moreover, the outpouring of support and number of small donors are an indication of excitement for a candidate who was supposed to have difficulty with online fundraising and a less-than-enthusiastic base. The reason may be simple: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), whose selection as Biden #8217;s running mate drove an outpouring of support in the days following the announcement. Trump #8217;s entire effort over the past couple of weeks has been an effort to paint the Democratic nominee as enfeebled and himself as the law-and-order candidate. Instead, Trump is having trouble fending off the perception he is off his rocker, as the latest Lincoln Project ad suggests: [Lincoln Project video] On the law-and-order side, Biden effectively flipped the script this way by reminding Americans that the violence has taken place in Trump #8217;s America and that Trump has incited violence. The Biden campaign thinks this is a compelling message: [Biden ad] Moreover, Biden continues to lead Trump in polling on the law-and-order issue. A new Morning Consult-Politico poll reported on Wednesday that "47 percent of voters said they trust Biden more to handle public safety, compared to 39 percent who said they place more trust in Trump. The president #8217;s deficit on safety  #8212; one of many issues on which Biden is more trusted  #8212; comes as Trump has sought to portray the former vice president as a danger to voters #8217; personal security in advertising, on Twitter and perhaps most prominently during his Aug. 27 address from the Republican National Convention. #8221; This might explain why Biden feels confident in going to Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday; rather than avoid the law-and-order issue, he seems to be saying,  #8220;Bring it on. #8221; Biden has a 7.5 percent national lead in the FiveThirtyEight average, a tick down from a peak of about 9 points. Even still, he has remained remarkably steady since June. He maintains leads in battleground states such as Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. Based on current polling, Biden has more than enough to surpass 270 electoral votes needed to win. The race could certainly change in nine weeks, although none of the recent events seems to have recast the race. The conventions are over; the debates remain. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderators for the three presidential debates  #8212; Fox News #8217;s Chris Wallace (who made mincemeat of Trump in their last interview), CSPAN #8217;s Steve Scully and NBC News #8217;s Kristen Welker. It is far from certain that Trump can maintain his a-factual, conspiracy-laden mind-set with an aggressive opponent and unflinching moderator  #8212; although there is plenty of research to suggest debates do not change voters #8217; minds. As for real-world conditions, we do know that coronavirus deaths will continue to rise and that unemployment will remain quite high by historic standards. No wonder Trump seems increasingly frantic and inclined to spew outlandish conspiracy theories."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "I never want to hear President Trump whine about phony accounts of voter fraud again. On Wednesday, he suggested North Carolina voters should test their vote-by-mail system, thereby committing what amounts to voter fraud.  #8220;Let them send it in and let them go vote, and if their system #8217;s as good as they say it is, then obviously they won #8217;t be able to vote," Trump said. "If it isn #8217;t tabulated, they #8217;ll be able to vote. #8221; This would be illegal  #8212; and obviously so. Attorney General William P. Barr pleaded ignorance on Wednesday as to whether voting twice is a crime and also ducked a question from CNN #8217;s Wolf Blitzer about how many actual voter fraud claims the feds have pursued. (Hint: Hardly any.) Trump and his enablers have gone from making up claims of voter fraud to countenancing and encouraging it. I never want to hear Republicans complain about the debt again. The Post reports,  #8220;For the first time since World War II, the U.S. government #8217;s debt will roughly equal the size of the entire American economy by the end of this year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. #8221; The numbers are eye-popping:  #8220;By the end of 2020, the amount of debt owed by the United States will amount to 98 percent of the nation #8217;s gross domestic product, the CBO said. That is up from 79 percent last year. Total government debt will surpass the U.S. economy #8217;s size next year, the CBO said. #8221; If Democrats win control of the government in November, why shouldn #8217;t they feel free to spend with the same abandon Republicans have? I never want to hear Republicans claim the  #8220;law and order #8221; mantle again. They have supported a president who glorifies violent White militias. They sneer at lawful subpoenas, the emoluments clause and the Hatch Act. No administration since Richard Nixon #8217;s has had more presidential associates and staffers indicted (and convicted). No Senate Republican gets to complain about the qualities of a Democrat #8217;s nominees after Trump nominated nine judges rated  #8220;unqualified #8221; by the American Bar Association and put a flock of inexperienced and unqualified people in executive posts (e.g., Rex Tillerson, Matthew Whitaker, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Kathy Kraninger, Richard Grenell). Republicans have also lost the credibility to complain about executive overreach after they countenanced Trump #8217;s efforts to snatch funds from the military to pay for the border wall, to deploy unmarked federal troops to states without consent of governors and to assert  #8220;absolute immunity #8221; from subpoenas. And now that a Republican president has unilaterally sought to yank funds from  #8220;anarchist jurisdictions #8221; and from cities that refused to allow local law enforcement to be dragooned into performing federal immigration enforcement  #8212; not to mention Trump #8217;s attempt to prevent states from setting higher regulatory standards  #8212; Republicans do not get to waive the 10th Amendment flag when it suits their fancy. No more moaning about taxpayer-funded family trips or golf time. No more criticism of executive branch turnover. Of course, just because Trump urged illegal conduct, encouraged voter fraud, ran up mammoth debt, associated with criminals, put incompetent cronies in top jobs, trashed the separations of powers and bilked the taxpayers does not mean Democrats should do the same. It does, however, mean that Republicans have lost the credibility to govern or to obstruct based on principles they abandoned during Trump #8217;s tenure."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weirdly, that's a possible scheme in a state where Biden wins, but there's a Republican governor. Refusing to certify a winner, at least in a timely manner, might throw the election into the House, where each state gets one vote, based on which party has more members. In such a scenario, the Republicans would win. And civil war might break out. But seriously, is there a single thing you cn say with confidence Trump *wouldn't* do to stay in office?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: by David Ignatius "Reconciling Donald Trump #8217;s self-promoting  #8220;Art of the Deal #8221; with the military #8217;s reserved code of loyalty and service was always a stretch. In Trump #8217;s early months in the White House, though, the two cultures seemed to coexist without much damage. But the fabric began to fray by mid-2017. Trump increasingly treated the military as props in the reality-TV show of his presidency. He wanted them for parades and victory celebrations, not the anguish of combat. He seemed to take his strategic guidance from Fox News more than his commanders. The generals and admirals kept their mouths shut, but the resentment was building. The bad marriage exploded this week, when former senior staff members told Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic of their shock at Trump #8217;s crude comments about combat and loss  #8212; and his reported characterization of fallen warriors as  #8220;suckers #8221; and  #8220;losers. #8221; The quotes were anonymous, but it has been an open secret in Washington that many prominent retired four-stars have regarded Trump with growing horror as he assaulted the traditions of discipline and professionalism that are bedrocks of military life. The first open break point came in June, after former military leaders watched Trump try to use the military to put down protests for racial justice. Retired Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, denounced Trump for  #8220;politicizing the men and women of our armed forces. #8221; Retired Gen. Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary, called Trump  #8220;the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. #8221; Retired Gen. John F. Kelly, a former Trump White House chief of staff, said he agreed with Mattis. It #8217;s hard to remember now that Trump #8217;s dealings with military leaders started off pretty well. I remember traveling in May 2017 with our Special Operations forces to the newly liberated town of Tabqa, at the gates of the Islamic State #8217;s capital of Raqqa. A senior U.S. official told the Syrian Kurdish commander who led the assault that this rapid assault  #8220;never would have happened without Donald Trump. #8221; There would have been too many meetings under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump wanted victory in Afghanistan, too, so long as it was fast and unambiguous. Gen. John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Kabul, was given authority to use America #8217;s most intimidating conventional weapon against the Taliban  #8212; the so-called  #8220;mother of all bombs. #8221; No more anguished meetings in the Situation Room. The gloves were off. Trump initially saw Mattis as a man in his own image  #8212; awarding him the Trumpian nickname  #8220;Mad Dog, #8221; even though the ascetic Mattis was closer to a monk than a mongrel. Over the two years Mattis ran the Pentagon, his relationship with Trump grew poisonous. The more Mattis tried to educate Trump, as in his widely reported July 2017 seminar in the  #8220;tank #8221; at Pentagon, the more Trump became resentful. Trump berated his generals at that gathering  #8212; with language that #8217;s eerily similar to what was reported in the Atlantic this week. According to Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig in their book,  #8220;A Very Stable Genius, #8221; Trump said:  #8220;You #8217;re all losers. You don #8217;t know how to win anymore. #8221; Trump really did seem to think he knew better than his generals.  #8220;I wouldn #8217;t go to war with you people, #8221; Trump told them, according to Rucker and Leonnig.  #8220;You #8217;re a bunch of dopes and babies. #8221; The commander who succeeded best in keeping the lid on, as Trump grew cockier, was Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. A tall, reserved and utterly reliable Marine, he was often able to curb Trump #8217;s impulsive decisions and steer him toward steady policy, without infuriating him. What the military liked in Trump was that he was sometimes (not always) prepared to  #8220;take the shot #8221; at terrorist adversaries, such as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, and Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran #8217;s Quds Force. Trump #8217;s near-constant belittling of NATO hurt his standing with the Pentagon. So did his inexplicable affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yet military leaders bit their lips, because they were grateful that Trump had endorsed a national military strategy that took a tougher stance toward Russia and China  #8212; and added money for new weapons to combat these near-peer adversaries. A heartbreaker for the military was Trump #8217;s decision to abandon the Syrian Kurds who had fought so bravely against the Islamic State. I remember talking to the officer who had to break the news of Trump #8217;s decision to quit Syria to Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces. His description of that betrayal was unprintable. What the military came to understand over the past four years is that, for all Trump #8217;s talk of patriotism, he truly is transactional. Throughout his career, he has always believed that loyalty was for chumps. That #8217;s why New York business executives told me back in early 2016 they had never wanted to do business with him. The military understand their role in a democracy. They have obeyed Trump as their commander in chief, even amid his tirades and insults. And they will continue to do so if he #8217;s reelected. But many of them won #8217;t like it: Trump just isn #8217;t a guy with whom you #8217;d want to share a foxhole."</TEXT>

The Republican South Carolina governor said Tuesday that she's not sure if she'll endorse anyone for president ahead of the Republican South Carolina primary, but if she does, it won't be Trump, according to CNN affiliate WIS Television in Columbia. She said Trump represents "everything a governor doesn't want in a president." "I want someone who is going to hold Republicans accountable, and I want someone who is going to make a difference, not just for our party but for every person they represent in the country," she told reporters, just days ahead of the South Carolina GOP primary on Saturday."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The most noteworthy aspect of national and state polling is their consistency. According to FiveThirtyEight #8217;s national poll average, Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads by about 7 #189; points over President Trump. For months, no credible public poll has showed Trump winning. The vast majority of polls released recently show Biden with a high single-digit or low double-digit lead. In Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and Arizona  #8212; all states Trump won in 2016  #8212; polls uniformly show Biden with at least a small lead. In many surveys, he enjoys a comfortable high single-digit lead in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wisconsin is striking because that state has gained attention for violence in Kenosha and is therefore front and center in Trump #8217;s effort to spread White resentment, fear and anger toward Blacks. It has not worked. The CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday shows Biden has a 10-point advantage nationally and the same 10-point (49 to 39 percent) over Trump when it comes to calming violence. Meanwhile,  #8220;the larger notion that violence could come to  #8216;the suburbs #8217; finds little concern among those who actually reside in the suburbs, #8221; CBS News said. The overwhelming majority favors an approach to violence adopted by Biden. "[B]y more than two to one, voters feel the way to end them is to make police reforms and address discrimination, not to use law enforcement to punish protesters. Even the president #8217;s own backers aren #8217;t overly convinced the latter approach is better, #8221; the report said. Most calamitous for Trump, voters by a wide margin (55 to 45 percent) see the election as a referendum on his four years rather than what Trump (21 percent) or Biden (24 percent) propose going forward. On metrics such as cares about people (63 to 44 percent), temperament (59 to 37 percent) and intelligence (56 to 47 percent), Biden clobbers Trump. Far more voters (50 percent) blame Trump than credit him (33 percent) for the covid-19 response. In sum, Trump #8217;s law-and-order message does not work, because many more voters see him as inflaming the situation. His accusation that Biden is some weakling, incapable of keeping the peace, falters because voters overwhelmingly like Biden #8217;s approach and understand that a solution to the violence requires addressing the basic concerns of racial justice advocates. Instead of winning over new adherents, Trump #8217;s  #8220;more cowbell #8221; approach  #8212; ever more hysterical tweets, racist appeals and unhinged conspiracies  #8212; hardens voters #8217; positions. That is tremendously helpful for Biden, who has seen his lead solidify, but terrible news for a president who trails nationally and is behind in polls in many swing states he won in 2016. It is entirely possible Biden will win back the three Rust Belt states Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 (Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania), sealing the electoral majority  #8212; and then also pick up states such as Florida, North Carolina and Arizona. A word is in order about the reports from multiple outlets confirming Trump in private disparaged wounded and dead military personnel as  #8220;suckers #8221; and  #8220;losers. #8221; It may be that for a small segment of weak pro-Trump voters who were teetering on the edge of abandoning him, the report provided a decisive push in Biden #8217;s direction. Just as damaging for Trump and worse for his party, however, is the potential that despondent Republicans will not show up at all (and won #8217;t vote by mail since Trump  #8212; falsely  #8212; said that was rife with fraud). That not only spells disaster for Trump. It also means Republicans up and down the ticket may get swept away in a blue tide. That would be an appropriate penalty for enabling and rationalizing Trump #8217;s odious behavior. I recall Gabriel Sherman #8217;s report two months ago when he wrote:  #8220;A Republican strategist close to Mitch McConnell told me that Republicans have Labor Day penciled in as the deadline for Trump to have turned things around. After that, he #8217;s on his own. #8221; It #8217;s Labor Day, and he hasn #8217;t turned it around. Your call, Republican incumbents."</TEXT>

Get in a sealed, mirrored box and turn on the flashlight, and the mass of the box will not go down, because the energy is still contained. In this atom, the potential energy is *negative,* because the particles have less energy when the bound state forms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump is fighting a losing battle against reports of his talk about the military, which he claims to revere but deeply resents. Multiple news organizations, including The Post, have confirmed private comments he made disparaging those who served as  #8220;suckers #8221; and  #8220;losers. #8221; These and his previous remarks  #8212; disrespecting POWs and allegedly telling the wife of a slain serviceman that her husband Sgt. La David T. Johnson  #8220;knew what he signed up for #8221;  #8212; are consistent with the narcissist #8217;s felt need to maintain an unduly high opinion of himself by diminishing others who have plainly surpassed him in courage and competence. Trump ducked military service; the valiant men and women who went in his place therefore must be denigrated, pitied and scorned. How foolish they went to war for me! Trump can deny his animosity until the cows come home but he remains unable to articulate real respect for those who have served. Recall the scene in  #8220;A Very Stable Genius, #8221; by Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, in which Trump called the service chiefs  #8220;a bunch of dopes and babies #8221; and barked,  #8220;You #8217;re all losers. You don #8217;t know how to win anymore. #8221; Trump did it all over again at a Monday news conference. He insisted (contrary to polling) that the rank and file troops are in love with him. However, he declared,  #8220;The top people in the Pentagon probably aren #8217;t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies  #8212; that make the bombs, and make the planes, and make everything else  #8212; stay happy. But we #8217;re getting out of the endless wars. #8221; In other words, they are bloodthirsty warmongers. The notion that generals want wars reveals his utter lack of understanding of the sacred responsibility commanders have for the troops and the sacrifices their own families have endured. Only a man shamed for having avoided war could imagine that those who serve are bloodthirsty savages. He simply cannot help himself. His niece, Mary L. Trump, reminds us that in the peculiar Trump family, military service was scorned and not celebrated.  #8220;Growing up in a mansion in Jamaica Estates in Queens, Trump heard the family criticize those who joined the military instead of going into business. Trump and his father, Fred Trump Sr., were especially harsh in criticizing the decision by Donald #8217;s older brother, Fred Jr., to join the U.S. Air National Guard #8218; #8221; my colleague Michael Kranish reported, quoting Mary Trump.  #8220;My father was frequently ridiculed for his career choices and disparaged for serving our country by both his father and by his brother Donald," Mary Trump said. Trump not only resents those who serve but also is at a loss to understand concepts like honor, discipline, sacrifice and loyalty. He thinks pardoning war criminals will make him popular with men and women in uniform who have sworn to uphold the Constitution and live by the military code of conduct. (Likewise, he thinks it will impress decent and law-abiding police officers when he says they should not "be too nice #8221; putting suspects in patrol cars.) Likewise, he once thought his cheering for war crimes  #8212; bombing the wives and family members of terrorists  #8212; would be impressive, until soon-to-be secretary of defense James Mattis set him straight. Trump reminds one of someone trying to fake fluency in a foreign language. Over and over, he makes glaring errors because he has no idea what he is talking about. At this point, only the most committed cult members believe Trump #8217;s denials. The rest of us can see and hear for him for ourselves. Trump #8217;s enormous ego and his shameful conduct when asked to serve mean he can never accord our military men and women  #8212; at whatever rank  #8212; the respect they deserve."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: " #8220;The end of Jim Crow laws did not end systematic poverty, limited opportunity, discrimination, disparities in health outcomes and environmental conditions, barriers to voting, the incidence of violence [and] deadly encounters with law enforcement, #8221; writes historian Jon Meacham in his just-released biography of the late Rep. John Lewis,  #8220;His Truth is Marching On. #8221; Indeed, the wealth gap (a persistent consequence of decades of intentional housing discrimination), the legacy of mass incarceration and the  #8220;war on drugs, #8221; voter suppression and unequal K-12 education may not be as visible as the chilling images of  #8220;Bull #8221; Connor #8217;s dogs and fire hoses unleashed on children or the state terror captured on camera on  #8220;Bloody Sunday. #8221; Nevertheless, they serve as a crushing weight and profound obstacle preventing millions of Americans from enjoying the same rights and opportunities afforded Whites, just as explicit, state-enforced segregation did in the pre-civil rights era. And yet, the overwhelming belief among members of President Trump #8217;s base  #8212; White evangelical Christians  #8212; is that Whites are the victims. The most recent American Values Survey conducted in 2019 tells us 69 percent of Republicans believe  #8220;discrimination against whites has become as much of a problem as discrimination against blacks." The irrational, a-factual sense of victimhood is precisely what Trump tapped into when he vowed to  #8220;Make America Great Again #8221;  #8212; in other words, to reverse social and economic change over the past decade and secure the dominance of his supporters. Such appeals to nostalgia and loss require Trump and much of the right to deny a mound of data that supports the obvious conclusion: They are not victims. They have enjoyed and continue to enjoy advantages by virtue of being White. To sustain their perverse view of America, Trump and his cult followers must insist that there is no systemic racism in schooling or policing or housing or any other facet of life. Whatever evidence is presented is deemed anecdotal or the fault of the victims of discrimination. The blame-the-victim tactic can often be seen after the shooting of an unarmed Black person by a police officer as right-wing pundits and politicians squint and strain to come up with false explanations for yet another episode in a pattern of endemic racism. (He was armed! He did not stop walking away!) The more evidence of blatant, persistent racism, the louder Trump hollers about invasion of the White suburbs and radical, violent marauders (ignoring violence from White militia members, however). This concocted fear among Whites of violent African Americans is straight from the Jim Crow playbook and is now (as was the case then) being used to justify extreme state-sponsored violence (whether in D.C.'s Lafayette Square or Portland, Ore.). It serves as a diversion and excuse to double down on the instruments of discrimination and to refuse action to alleviate the obvious manifestations of racism. At discrete moments in U.S. history  #8212; Bloody Sunday, George Floyd #8217;s killing  #8212; the visual evidence is so stunning and disturbing that the false victimhood of white supremacists crumbles. The public sees with perfect clarity who is the persecuted and who is the persecutor. In the wake of Bloody Sunday, we got the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because we had a pro-civil rights president with large Democratic majorities in Congress. With a virulently racist president and a Republican Senate dependent on White evangelical voters, the potential for change is nonexistent; it is only with a Democratic president and Congress that the horrific abuse of George Floyd and Jacob Blake and all the other men and women can provoke real reform. The underlying problem remains: A disturbingly large segment of White America clings to the view that they are victims. They take this as justification for deploying all instruments of government power (e.g., voter suppression, excessive police violence) to hang onto their power and dominance. Trump and his ilk thrash about and holler and promote violence. They defend the Confederate flag and give moral support to white-supremacist groups. The question remains as it did in the 1960s: Do we want to be the America that perpetuates the legacy of George Wallace, Bull Connor and the White Citizens #8217; Councils? Or do we want to be the America of John Lewis? Lewis actually believed in the Declaration of Independence, in the American creed. It is an open question whether the majority of Americans  #8212; in the right states adding up to 270 electoral votes  #8212; do, too."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "*Benjamin L. Ginsberg practiced election law for 38 years. He co-chaired the bipartisan 2013 Presidential Commission on Election Administration.* Legions of Republican lawyers have searched in vain over four decades for fraudulent double voting. At long last, they have a blatant example of a major politician urging his supporters to illegally vote twice. The only hitch is that the candidate is President Trump. The president, who has been arguing that our elections are  #8220;rigged #8221; and  #8220;fraudulent, #8221; last week instructed voters to act in a way that would fulfill that prophecy. On Wednesday in North Carolina, he urged supporters to double vote, casting ballots at the polls even if they have already mailed in absentee ballots. A tweet claiming he meant only for people to check that their ballots had been received and counted sounded fine  #8212; until Trump renewed his original push on Thursday evening in Pennsylvania and again Friday at a telerally. The president #8217;s actions  #8212; urging his followers to commit an illegal act and seeking to undermine confidence in the credibility of election results  #8212; are doubly wrong. They impose an obligation on his campaign and the Republican Party to reevaluate their position in the more than 40 voting cases they #8217;re involved in around the country. These cases are part of a torrent of 2020 voting litigation that pits Republicans #8217; belief that election results won #8217;t be credible without state law safeguards against Democrats #8217; charges that many such rules are onerous and designed to suppress the votes of qualified citizens inclined to vote Democratic. The president #8217;s words make his and the Republican Party #8217;s rhetoric look less like sincere concern  #8212; and more like transactional hypocrisy designed to provide an electoral advantage. And they come as Republicans trying to make their cases in courts must deal with the basic truth that four decades of dedicated investigation have produced only isolated incidents of election fraud. These are painful conclusions for me to reach. Before retiring from law practice last month, I spent 38 years in the GOP #8217;s legal trenches. I was part of the 1990s redistricting that ended 40 years of Democratic control and brought 30 years of GOP successes in Congress and state legislatures. I played a central role in the 2000 Florida recount and several dozen Senate, House and state contests. I served as counsel to all three Republican national party committees and represented four of the past six Republican presidential nominees (including, through my law firm, Trump 2020). Each Election Day since 1984, I #8217;ve been in precincts looking for voting violations, or in Washington helping run the nationwide GOP Election Day operations, overseeing the thousands of Republican lawyers and operatives each election on alert for voting fraud. In every election, Republicans have been in polling places and vote tabulation centers. Republican lawyers in every state have been able to examine mail-in/absentee ballot programs. The president has said that  #8220;the only way we can lose  #8230; is if cheating goes on. #8221; He has asserted that mail-in voting is  #8220;very dangerous #8221; and that  #8220;there is tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality. #8221; The lack of evidence renders these claims unsustainable. The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there #8217;s no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated incidents  #8212; by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not rigged. Absentee ballots use the same process as mail-in ballots  #8212; different states use different labels for the same process. The Trump 2016 campaign, of which I was not a part, could produce no hard evidence of systemic fraud. Trump established a Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in 2017 to expose all the fraud he maintains permeates our elections. He named the most vociferous hunters of Democratic election fraud to run the commission. It disbanded without finding anything. The Heritage Foundation Election Fraud Database has compiled every instance of any kind of voter fraud it could find since 1982. It contains 1,296 incidents, a minuscule percentage of the votes cast. A study of results in three states where all voters are mailed actual ballots, a practice at the apex of the president #8217;s outrage, found just 372 possible cases of illegal voting of 14.6 million cast in the 2016 and 2018 general elections  #8212; 0.0025 percent. The president #8217;s rhetoric has put my party in the position of a firefighter who deliberately sets fires to look like a hero putting them out. Republicans need to take a hard look before advocating laws that actually do limit the franchise of otherwise qualified voters. Calling elections  #8220;fraudulent #8221; and results  #8220;rigged #8221; with almost nonexistent evidence is antithetical to being the  #8220;rule of law #8221; party. Many of the GOP #8217;s litigation concerns are meritorious in principle. But the president #8217;s inflammatory language undercuts the claim that Republicans seek merely to uphold statutory safeguards needed to validate the results #8217; credibility. Republicans need to rethink their arguments in many of the cases in which they are involved  #8212; quickly. Otherwise, they risk harming the fundamental principle of our democracy: that all eligible voters must be allowed to cast their ballots. If that happens, Americans will deservedly render the GOP a minority party for a long, long time."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: " #8220;Many plants are being built right now  #8212; auto plants  #8212; in Michigan, just like I said. They #8217;re being built in Ohio, they #8217;re being built in South Carolina, North Carolina, they #8217;re being built all over and expanded at a level that we #8217;ve never seen before. Cause I said to Japan, Germany and others,  #8216;Sorry, you #8217;ve got to come here and build plants, otherwise we #8217;re going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs. #8217;  #8221;  #8212; President Trump, remarks on Labor Day, Sept. 7, 2020 We have documented before the president #8217;s  #8220;swing-state spin, #8221; in which he claims he has achieved great economic success for states that, coincidentally, are necessary for him to achieve an electoral college victory. According to our database of Trump #8217;s false and misleading claims, the president has mentioned Michigan in 120 false claims, Ohio in 94 claims and North Carolina in 68 claims. South Carolina is not a swing state, but it may have a competitive Senate race, so that may be why it slipped into his spiel on Labor Day It #8217;s been a while since we have reviewed these claims in a full fact check. So has anything happened to make Trump #8217;s falsehoods any more true? The Facts Essentially, Trump says that under his watch, auto assembly plants have been added at an unprecedented rate in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and possibly other states  #8212;  #8220;they #8217;re being built all over and expanded at a level that we #8217;ve never seen before. #8221; He attributes this to his jawboning of countries such as Japan and Germany  #8212; and his threat of higher tariffs. So we checked in with the experts at the Center for Automotive Research, a group that assiduously tracks this information. No surprise. Trump is making stuff up. Kristin Dziczek, vice president at CAR, said there have been four new auto assembly plants announced since Trump took office  #8212; three in Michigan, one in Alabama. Here are the details, with the information provided by Dziczek. - Navya, a French company, announced 2017. This is the company #8217;s first North American production facility, which will roll out 25 of its driverless Arma shuttles by the end of the year. Kits will be brought from France initially, but Navya is under contract with U.S. suppliers to provide parts. (Saline, Mich., 50 jobs.) - Toyota, a Japanese company, in a joint venture with Mazda, announced 2017. Toyota Motor Corp. has abandoned plans to build Corolla sedans at a joint assembly plant it is building in cooperation with Mazda in Huntsville, Ala., and instead will build an as-yet-unannounced crossover there. (4,000 jobs.) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), an Italian-American multinational, announced 2018. FCA plans to convert the Mack Avenue Engine factory in Detroit to an assembly plant for the next-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee and a new, large Jeep SUV. (3,850 jobs.) - Waymo, a U.S. company that is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., announced 2019. The company plans to bring a factory to Michigan, creating up to 400 jobs at what it describes as the world #8217;s first plant  #8220;100% #8221; dedicated to the mass production of autonomous vehicles. The company plans to spend about $13.6 million to retrofit a to-be-determined manufacturing facility in the Detroit area. Note that only two are completely foreign-owned companies, with one company mostly relying on its overseas suppliers. There are no new plants in Ohio, North Carolina or South Carolina. Mercedes-Benz, a German company, and Volvo, a Swedish company, both opened plants in South Carolina in 2018, but the projects broke ground in 2015, before Trump was elected. So that doesn #8217;t count. As for his claim of unprecedented investment, Dziczek said:  #8220;In total, there were over $64.2 billion in automaker manufacturing investment announcements in the United States between 2013-2016 (previous three-year period) vs. $40.0B between 2017-2020. #8221; In other words, not unprecedented. We sought comment from the White House but did not get a response. The Pinocchio Test The president wants to present a good-news story to his supporters. But the reality is different. AD Only four new auto plants have been announced since Trump took office, and investment in auto manufacturing was higher under the last three years of Barack Obama #8217;s presidency than the first three of Trump #8217;s. Three of the four states name-checked by Trump do not have new plants. And there #8217;s no evidence that Trump #8217;s threat of tariffs led to more auto investment. Trump earns Four Pinocchios. **Four Pinocchios**"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "All dictatorships must suppress inconvenient truths and spread convenient lies. We still live in a democracy, but President Trump displays a dictator #8217;s aversion to the truth. Indeed, his whole administration is built on a foundation of lies. That is the common theme of this week #8217;s big news stories: Bob Woodward #8217;s revelation that Trump knew how bad covid-19 was but pretended otherwise, and a whistleblower #8217;s revelation that Department of Homeland Security leaders ordered him to adjust intelligence estimates to reflect the president #8217;s political preferences. In a way, Woodward #8217;s book is almost reassuring. It shows that Trump was not entirely delusional. He actually realized that the coronavirus was far more threatening than the flu. He just chose to deceive the American public by playing down the disease at least 108 times. His explanation: He is  #8220;a cheerleader for this country, #8221; and he didn #8217;t want to cause  #8220;panic #8221; or a  #8220;frenzy. #8221; That #8217;s pretty rich given how hard he has worked to generate panic about exaggerated threats such as refugee  #8220;caravans #8221; and antifa goon squads. Trump is more often a doomsayer than a cheerleader. On Thursday, for example, he tweeted:  #8220;If I don #8217;t win, America #8217;s Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects, Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and, of course,  #8216;Friendly Protesters. #8217;  #8221; So why lie to play down a genuine threat while hyping largely imaginary threats? That is the biggest mystery of Trump #8217;s catastrophic covid-19 response. He would have been far better off leveling with the public. Not only would this have saved countless lives, it also might have saved the Trump presidency. But he just couldn #8217;t break the mendacious habits of a lifetime. No doubt he imagined he could bluff and spin his way through the pandemic the way he had done with countless crises in the past, from corporate bankruptcies to his impeachment. He did not seem to realize that a virus could not be banished with happy talk. Whatever Trump #8217;s motivation, his falsehoods are criminal and inexcusable. On second thought, that he knew better actually makes it worse. Trump is like the captain of a ship who knows it is about to hit an iceberg but doesn #8217;t tell the passengers to make for the lifeboats. That is an offense even more serious than simply falling asleep at the watch. Even as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases passes 3 million, President Trump has repeatedly played down covid-19 #8217;s toll on the country. (Video: Joy Sharon Yi, Danielle Kunitz/Photo: Jonathan Newton / Washington Post/The Washington Post) What makes Trump #8217;s lies particularly pernicious is how they seep through the entire infrastructure of government like a corrosive acid, eating away at governmental capacity to respond to the real threats we face. When this president denies reality, so do all of his mini-Trumps. Here is White House trade adviser Peter Navarro speaking about the coronavirus on Feb. 24:  #8220;Nothing to worry about for the American people. #8221; White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Feb. 25:  #8220;We have contained this. I won #8217;t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. #8221; White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on March 6:  #8220;It is being contained. Do you not think it is being contained? #8221; Most of the president #8217;s men and women also joined him in touting quack cures such as hydroxychloroquine while denigrating what really works  #8212; mask-wearing and social distancing. Those who challenged Trump #8217;s falsehoods were either demoted (Rick Bright at the Department of Health and Human Services) or simply sidelined (Anthony S. Fauci at the National Institutes of Health). The same imperative to distort reality to the president #8217;s liking is evident at the Department of Homeland Security, according to a whistleblower #8217;s complaint from Brian Murphy, a former FBI agent who until recently was principal deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis. Murphy claims his superiors at DHS pressured him to modify intelligence estimates to falsely assert that  #8220;large numbers of KSTs [known or suspected terrorists] were entering the United States through the southwest border, #8221; and to exaggerate violence from  #8220;ANTIFA and  #8216;anarchist #8217; groups #8221; while making the white-supremacist threat  #8220;appear less severe #8221; than it actually is. Most alarming of all, Murphy asserts that in mid-May he was instructed by acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf  #8220;to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran. #8221; Murphy says Wolf told him  #8220;these instructions specifically originated from White House National Security Adviser Robert O #8217;Brien. #8221; On July 8, Murphy alleges, Wolf told him to hold an alarming notification about Russian election interference because it  #8220;made the President look bad. #8221; Falsifying intelligence estimates for political purposes is one of the worst offenses a president can commit, because it blinds our government to the real threats we face. But, if Murphy is to be believed, this became a routine practice at DHS. It was also, we now know, routine at the White House, where Trump and his subordinates lied in public about the conclusions they had reached in private about the pandemic. Woodward and Murphy are actually telling two parts of the same story: how Trump #8217;s lies have corrupted the government and endangered the country. Now the lies are unraveling, but Trump supporters have become so habituated to his doublethink that it may be too late for them to acknowledge reality."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "There are moments that have signaled seismic shifts in U.S. history. The fevered pitch of McCarthyism was broken when Army counsel Joseph Welch, with tears in his eyes, asked Sen. Joe McCarthy,  #8220;Have you no sense of decency, sir? #8221; Ronald Reagan #8217;s ascension to the White House began with the former actor grabbing a microphone in a high school gym and declaring it his own. And Donald Trump #8217;s descent down a gold-plated escalator a generation later did the same for the reality TV star. But perhaps no scene better dramatizes the turbulent political age that we have been passing through for half a century than the  #8220;Hard Hat Riot #8221; of 1970. That violent showdown in Lower Manhattan pitted antiwar protesters against enraged union members, who took umbrage at  #8220;long-haired hippies #8221; they saw as desecrating the American flag. The chaotic event long ago passed into political folklore for conservatives, helping to mark the moment when White working-class identity shifted from economic to cultural. As Vanderbilt history professor Jefferson Cowie wrote in the New York Times in May,  #8220;The new class war would be waged not against the old corporate robber barons but the impudent snobs of the cultural elite. #8221; That shift may explain why so many working-class Americans have been voting against their own economic interests for so long. On May 8, 1970, the Times reported, union workers streamed out of the  #8220;soaring red steel skeleton #8221; of Tower A on the construction site of the World Trade Center and raced to an antiwar demonstration underway on Wall Street. The workers later told reporters they were determined to stop protesters from denigrating U.S. soldiers fighting in Vietnam.  #8220;I #8217;m doing this because my brother got wounded in Vietnam, and I think this will help our boys over there by pulling this country together, #8221; one construction worker told the Wall Street Journal. Chants of  #8220;Love it or leave it #8221; and shouts about killing  #8220;commies #8221; rang out above the chaos, before workers seized an American flag at Federal Hall and began singing  #8220;God Bless America #8221; under the watchful gaze of George Washington #8217;s statue. Then-president Richard Nixon declared  #8220;Thank God for the hard hats! #8221; and began building a  #8220;New Majority #8221; including White working-class voters who supported politicians they saw as backing the troops and revering their sacrifice. For decades, Republican politicians and thought leaders followed Nixon #8217;s lead, even when that meant shamelessly attacking Democratic war heroes such as George McGovern, Max Cleland and John Kerry for the political crime of being insufficiently patriotic. Given the party #8217;s brash support of all things  #8220;patriotic, #8221; the past week #8217;s developments have been disorienting even for the age of Trump. The jockeying for the post-Trump future of the Republican Party has started, says Post columnist Max Boot. (Video: Joy Sharon Yi, Kate Woodsome/Photo: Johnathan Newton/Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) Post associate editor Bob Woodward #8217;s new revelations regarding President Trump #8217;s pandemic performance will forever tarnish the 45th president #8217;s legacy, but Trump #8217;s savage attacks on America #8217;s military leaders and war dead will leave a lasting scar on his Republican Party. The playboy scion, who avoided military service in Vietnam by claiming bone spurs, told Woodward that the decorated military leaders who serve him are  #8220;pussies #8221; and  #8220;suckers. #8221; It can be no coincidence that the president reportedly also called the 1,800 Marines who died at Belleau Wood  #8220;suckers #8221; for giving their lives in war. After those comments were reported by the Atlantic #8217;s Jeffrey Goldberg, Trump predictably made matters worse for himself by mounting a defense that showed just how much he loathed the military and those who serve as its leaders.  #8220;They want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy, #8221; Trump blurted out at a news conference. This commander in chief offering lectures on the excesses of the military-industrial complex is laughable. He has, after all, championed weapons sales like no president before him. Trump even refused to cancel billions in arms sales to Saudi Arabia after the killing of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi because he didn #8217;t want to  #8220;lose an order like that. #8221; He said doing so would be unfair to Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon. Trump #8217;s Republican Party has been damaged yet again by their leader #8217;s offensive statements. It has also lost any claim it ever had at being the U.S. military #8217;s bulwark against left-wing attacks. A recent Military Times poll suggests that most active duty troops agree, with a plurality supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden #8217;s presidential bid. Perhaps Lindsey O. Graham was right when he predicted that Trump would destroy the Republican Party. The question that remains is why the South Carolina senator and so many of his peers stay silent while the honor of our military leaders is under attack by America #8217;s president. One wonders what the hard-hat rioters would have thought about that."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "One of William P. Barr #8217;s weaknesses is a godsend for the rule of law: The attorney general is not completely effective at lying. Or at least close observers of Barr have learned over time how to spot his many tricks. Barr #8217;s behavior in his prior career in government and in his current office reveals voluminous and specific examples in which he misled the public and Congress. Within hours, if not minutes, leading fact checkers documented several of Barr #8217;s deceptions in his congressional testimony on Tuesday. And there #8217;s every reason to suspect Barr will soon try again to mislead  #8212; this time regarding one of his most important initiatives to date, an investigation by his handpicked U.S. attorney, John Durham  #8212; in an effort to skew the 2020 elections. The problem is that there are two types of lies that Barr is willing to employ. One can be detected quickly. The other often takes time to uncover, and by that point, Barr may already have succeeded in his goal. Based on Barr #8217;s track record, it #8217;s important for the public to realize now that they can #8217;t take Barr #8217;s word on what Durham actually has found. The urgency of bracing people to disbelieve the attorney general increased dramatically on Tuesday, as Barr was asked whether he #8217;d apply long-standing Justice Department policy not to announce politically sensitive new cases before an election by holding Durham #8217;s findings until after Nov. 3. Barr #8217;s answer was, for him, a rarity in its clarity: He said no. Durham #8217;s investigation has become Barr #8217;s pet project. Durham #8217;s main task is an investigation of the investigators who tried to understand and protect the United States against Russian election interference in 2016. We don #8217;t know what Durham will conclude, but we #8217;re confident in this: Barr will likely distort those conclusions in a way favorable to President Trump #8217;s political ambitions. That goal seems to have driven Barr #8217;s public anticipation of  #8220;developments #8221; from Durham  #8220;before the end of the summer #8221;  #8212; that is, in time to influence the November election. Barr has a history of mischaracterizing and even lying about the results of investigations before their details are public. That #8217;s what Barr did to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III #8217;s investigation. The attorney general released his own  #8220;distorted #8221; and  #8220;misleading #8221; summary while delaying the release of Mueller #8217;s actual conclusions by weeks. Don #8217;t just take our word for it; those are the words of the federal judge who excoriated Barr for his deceit. By the time Barr allowed the rest of the country to see Mueller #8217;s actual conclusions  #8212; which were relentlessly damning for Trump  #8212; Barr #8217;s mischaracterization of Mueller #8217;s investigation as having exonerated the president had taken hold among key constituencies. And by the time the federal judge ruled on the matter, almost a year had passed. Far fewer Americans were even paying attention. There were several other flat-out lies by Barr during the course of those events: He misrepresented the role that the Justice Department #8217;s view that a sitting president can #8217;t be indicted had played in how Mueller approached his work, claiming it hadn #8217;t constrained Mueller #8217;s conclusions when Mueller clearly said it had; he told Congress he was unaware that Mueller #8217;s team was upset with his summary of their report, when in fact Mueller had conveyed his concern and frustration to Barr in writing; and he declared that the White House had  #8220;fully cooperated #8221; with Mueller, when Trump refused to testify under oath, sit down for an interview or answer a whole set of questions. Barr #8217;s summary wrought such havoc inside Congress that it likely succeeded in sharply narrowing the articles of impeachment against Trump, according to a book released earlier this week by Norman Eisen, who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the process. That #8217;s far different from Barr #8217;s other lies that implode on impact. Consider a recent example. After meeting in person with U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey S. Berman and failing to coerce Berman #8217;s resignation, Barr nonetheless announced publicly that Berman had stepped down. When Berman set the record straight that evening with a public statement that he had not in fact resigned, Barr was forced to regroup and, ultimately, name a different successor to Berman  #8212; the one mandated by law  #8212; before Berman then agreed to resign. The most remarkable part of the whole episode was Barr #8217;s brazen and easily disprovable public lie, and how quickly it was exposed thanks to Berman. Yet none of these past incidents seems as near and dear to Barr #8217;s heart as what #8217;s still to come: the conclusion of the Durham investigation. It #8217;s an investigation no ordinary attorney general would have ordered in the first place. Criminally investigating the investigators without any apparent wrongdoing is a bizarre step to take, and the very issues being explored by Durham already have been investigated by the Justice Department #8217;s inspector general, who found that the opening of the Russia investigation (code-named  #8220;Crossfire Hurricane #8221;) was properly predicated, with no evidence it was influenced by political bias. Yet Barr has pressed ahead  #8212; hard  #8212; with demanding that Durham investigate the FBI and, apparently, even other components of the intelligence community for their counterintelligence work in 2016. In a wild step for an attorney general, Barr has reportedly personally traveled the world to urge foreign governments to cooperate with Durham. There are signs that Barr has already enabled Durham #8217;s unorthodox behavior, which could foreshadow his own efforts to distort the public #8217;s understanding of whatever conclusions Durham will reach, whether those take the form of criminal charges, a written report or some combination. When the inspector general issued his much-anticipated report, Durham was in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation  #8212; a situation in which a federal prosecutor should, according to Justice Department policy, refrain from commenting publicly. Yet Durham did the opposite: He released a public statement indicating that, even though he was still conducting his investigation, he disagreed with the inspector general #8217;s conclusions. This was extraordinary, in addition to being a mid-investigation public commentary. It was also a public rebuke of the Justice Department #8217;s inspector general by another department official, and one that, it turns out, was misleading about where exactly Durham and the inspector general differed. But Barr #8217;s spin works only if others take his word for it or imbue him with the credibility of an attorney general faithfully executing his oath of office. Whatever conclusions Durham actually reaches, Barr #8217;s history indicates that he #8217;ll make them sound better for Trump and worse for the counterintelligence work of America #8217;s public servants. As The Washington Post #8217;s Amber Phillips wrote about Barr #8217;s most recent testimony, takeaway number one is:  #8220;He is all in as a partisan player. #8221; When it comes to spin, being forewarned is being forearmed: Don #8217;t buy it. It #8217;s essential that Congress, the media and the public refuse to accept what Barr says at face value. Wait till we see what Durham #8217;s investigation actually concludes  #8212; then we can applaud or criticize those results as we all see fit, but at least we #8217;ll elude the grasp of Barr #8217;s distortions."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mark Levin talked about how the Dems are planning to deploy their paramilitary rioters after the voting. Roger Stone went on Alex Jones and encouraged Trump to seize ballot boxes, nationalize state police forces, and arrest Dems. Both Stone and Trump are now referring to the Insurrection Act, which enables the president to sic American troops and National Guard on American citizens. So here's the scenario they're setting up. On Election Day, Trump goons and vigilantes start actual looting and rioting (think "Umbrella Guy"), disrupting voting, especially in swing states and Dem districts. Trump then sends in his camo-goons (like Portland) and in the process they stop voting, seize ballot boxes, and totally screw up any chance for vote-counting, especially after the polls close, because Dems are heavy on mail voting. Think they wouldn't do it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "What in the world happened to hope? It #8217;s hard to remember a gloomier time in our public life. So much of the analysis we read, the news we consume and the hot takes that fly by us on social media suggest that the exits from this dreadful era are blocked. We #8217;re led to believe that our country faces inexorable decline and that those who see the possibility of reform and redemption are deluded. We owe much of this pessimism to the presidency of Donald Trump, and not just because of his blindingly obvious failures. Unlike most incumbents in our history, he has bet his political survival on the proposition that the country is living through a dystopian nightmare that only he can dispel. Trump talks relentlessly about a crisis of crime and violence, says that our electoral system can #8217;t be trusted, and argues that those who are against him are enemies of the country itself. He promises yet more division if he is reelected, threatens his political foes with prosecution, and hints now and again that he would like to be our leader for life. It is former vice president Joe Biden, the challenger, who has the sunny view. The heart of his argument is that there is nothing wrong with our country that can #8217;t be cured as long as we throw Trump out of office. From the first day of his campaign to this moment, he has made the same case: We can view four years of Trump as an aberration that we can put behind us. But eight years would set us on a course from which there would be no return. What #8217;s striking is that many who are Biden #8217;s strongest supporters and Trump #8217;s most fervent foes are deeply skeptical of the old warhorse #8217;s optimism. There is, first, the fear that even if Biden wins the popular vote  #8212; this now seems nearly inevitable  #8212; he might lose the electoral college. And if Biden prevails there, too, it is easy to imagine Trump trying to cling to power by discrediting the result with a pack of lies about the voting process. This, in turn, means that Trump #8217;s most fervent loyalists will never accept a Biden victory. The new president will thus take over a nation torn asunder, and the most somber pessimists predict that armed militias could threaten public order. Less apocalyptic is the potential, thoughtfully outlined last week by my Post colleague Annie Linskey,  #8220;for post-election clashes #8221; within the broad coalition Biden has assembled. In this view, moderates and progressives in the party will wage war over specific issues such as the shape of a future health-care program, and on the larger question of how adventurous Biden #8217;s overall agenda should be. And nobody is expecting Republicans to make Biden #8217;s job any easier. In the face of all this grimness, I would offer a practical case for hope. It is equally plausible from current polls to predict a close outcome or a Biden landslide. Which is to say Biden #8217;s current lead could shrink or grow. An overwhelming Biden victory, which becomes more likely if he performs well in the debates, would obviate many of the problems outlined above. In particular, a Biden sweep would make Trump #8217;s fraud claims look absurd to many of his own voters. A big Biden win would help Democrats take control of both the Senate and the House, creating a real opportunity to govern effectively. Okay, never underestimate the Democrats #8217; capacity to tear each other apart. But confronting a pandemic and an economic catastrophe would concentrate minds. Every Democrat, from center to left, would understand that blowing it this time would cause irreparable damage to themselves and to the country. And while the differences across the party #8217;s wings are real, they #8217;re also exaggerated. Between single-payer health care and simply expanding Obamacare, there #8217;s a lot of room for compromise. Ditto on how to combat climate change and expand access to education and training. And the economy is in sufficiently dire shape that boldness, in both a short-term recovery plan and a long-term investment strategy, could look simultaneously like realism to centrists and a  #8220;New New Deal #8221; to progressives. Finally, as Adam Serwer argues in a powerful and historically informed essay in the Atlantic, a majority may well exist for a new Reconstruction Era on behalf of racial justice. We #8217;re a better country than Trump thinks we are. Hope is not a feeling, it #8217;s a virtue. We have good reason to practice it right now  #8212; and no alternative but to embrace it."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump cannot help himself. As he is battling to play down his own admission that he played down the covid-19 threat to avoid  #8220;panic, #8221; he seems determined to demonstrate how little he cares for the safety and lives of fellow Americans. The Reno Gazette Journal reported on Trump #8217;s weekend rally in Nevada:  #8220;President Donald Trump staged a rally in Minden on Saturday after officials rebuffed similar airport rallies in Reno and Las Vegas, citing Nevada #8217;s months-long ban on gatherings of more than 50 people during the coronavirus pandemic. #8221; Deprived of the chance to endanger voters in the state #8217;s two major cities, he went prowling elsewhere for supporters willing to risk their own health.  #8220;Trump  #8212; speaking to a crowd of at least 5,000 largely maskless supporters densely packed on the Tarmac at Minden-Tahoe Airport on Saturday  #8212; repeated unsupported claims that Nevada #8217;s governor sought to scuttle an earlier planned campaign rally in Reno. #8221; (Trump also made a number of alarming, incoherent claims such as  #8220;they #8221;  #8212; Democrats?  #8212;  #8220;want to punish you for going to church while agitators and anarchists try to burn your churches down. #8221; He #8217;s truly a panic-inducer at heart.) The state Democratic Party chair, William McCurdy II, rapped Trump #8217;s reckless conduct, saying,  #8220;Trump is endangering Nevadans and flying in the face of his own White House recommendations by holding rallies this weekend. These emergency directives were put in place because under Trump #8217;s watch, the outbreak of coronavirus got out of control. Over 190,000 Americans are dead, including nearly 1,500 Nevadans. But still, Trump continues to care more about boosting his own ego through superspreader rallies than about the health and safety of Nevadans. #8221; That is a powerful message that cannot be repeated enough. Appearing on ABC News #8217;  #8220;This Week, #8221; Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders told host George Stephanopoulos that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), are  #8220;actively campaigning, #8221; but the difference with Trump #8217;s campaigning is  #8220;we #8217;re doing it so safely. #8221; In other words, Biden is not risking superspreader rallies.  #8220;We are letting the science lead us, #8221; Sanders said.  #8220;We are listening to the experts. You know, safety is of the utmost importance to our campaign  #8212; the safety of the voters, the safety of our campaign staff. #8221; With dry understatement, she excoriated Trump #8217;s conduct.  #8220;It #8217;s not safe and it #8217;s not modeling good behavior. #8221; Even more irresponsibly, Trump held an indoor event on Sunday in Nevada. The Post reported,  #8220;According to CNN, the city of Henderson has warned Xtreme Manufacturing, the site of Sunday #8217;s rally, that the planned event is in violation of state regulations prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people. #8221; Rules - and health precautions - are for others. Trump should come under extreme pressure to stop these events. This is precisely the mind-set he revealed on the calls with Bob Woodward that sent shock waves through the race in the past week. Trump will do whatever he perceives is in his own personal and political interest even if it means the possibility of endangering lives. He did not care enough about American lives early in the pandemic, so he delivered a false message that may have dissuaded many people from taking protective measures. When the virus began to spread, he again played down the health risks and goaded Republican governors to reopen their states, thereby extending the first wave of outbreaks well into the summer. And now with the U.S. death toll approaching 200,000 and criticism raining down on him, he still holds rallies that put Americans in harm #8217;s way. As in the aftermath of the Tulsa rally in June, we can expect a trail of infections following Trump rallies like the one in Nevada. In short, even now Trump #8217;s reckless disregard for human life continues. That  #8212; just as much as the Woodward tapes  #8212; should shock the conscience of every decent American."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Female voters in presidential elections outnumber men  #8212; by a lot. In the 2016 exit polls, 53 percent of the electorate was female. It is no wonder both sides are striving to win over these women  #8212; especially White women, whom President Trump won in 2016. Come November, it seems these crucial voters may cast their ballots for Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Trump #8217;s campaign is suffused with race-baiting and condescension toward women ( #8220;suburban housewives #8221;). On health care, normally the most important issue for women, Trump threatens to undo the Affordable Care Act. He also lied to the public about covid-19, resulting in close to 200,000 deaths,  #8220;virtual schooling #8221; (a nightmare for many women who must work and supervise their children #8217;s education), food insecurity, 27 million workers looking for jobless benefits, and widespread fear of eviction. What #8217;s not to like, right? A significant majority of women do not like what they see. The nonpartisan group All in Together recently commissioned a poll with Lake Research and Emerson College Polling of 1,273 registered women, oversampling 668 registered female voters in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Arizona, Virginia, Colorado, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The poll found:  #8220;Women voters favor Biden by 11-points [higher than Hillary Clinton #8217;s margin in 2016], men voters prefer Trump by a 7-point margin (50% Trump, 43% Biden, 7% undecided), for a gender gap of 18-points.  #8230; Despite the Trump campaign #8217;s efforts to gain suburban women #8217;s support, they are breaking for Biden by a 14% margin. Senior women are also voting for Biden (54%) over Trump (42%) with 5% undecided. #8221; Unsurprisingly, Black women favor Biden by a huge margin (84 percent to 12 percent), as do women younger than 30 (78 percent to 18 percent). Trump still leads among White non-college-educated women, but in what must be a three-alarm fire for Republicans, the pollsters report,  #8220;Of the women who usually vote for Republicans, 25% are voting for Biden this year (71% are voting for Trump). #8221; If you want to know what those ads from the Lincoln Project and Republican Voters Against Trump are doing, this is it. They are peeling off the most susceptible Republicans, who tend to be women. Women simply do not like Trump. Fifty-five percent of women  #8212; including 50 percent in battleground states  #8212; have an unfavorable view of him. Women voters #8217; preference for Biden spans multiple issues: - Women give Biden a 23-point advantage on race relations (57% trust Biden more to 34% trust Trump more). - Biden has a 21-point advantage among women on handling the coronavirus pandemic (57% to 36%). - Women give Biden a 14-point advantage on reopening schools (52% to 38%). - Women give Biden a 10-point advantage on law and order (52% to 42%). - Finally, women give Biden an 8-point advantage on economic recovery (51% to 43%). In critical battleground states, women favor Biden over Trump on law and order by a margin of 51 percent to 42 percent. Stressing law and order (aside from lying to Americans about covid-19) may turn out to be Trump #8217;s single dumbest campaign move. Keep in mind that while Trump still wins over White non-college-educated women, his lead (59 percent to 37 percent) is less than his 61 percent to 34 percent margin in 2016. Meanwhile, Biden is doing better than Clinton did with women in most public polls. If Biden continues to bolster his advantage with White college-educated women, turn out female voters of color and narrow his deficit with White non-college-educated women, he will be in a much better position to win than Clinton, especially in battleground states. If Biden does win, a good deal of the credit will go to women voters."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Nobody knows for sure who will win in November. Joe Biden holds the advantage right now, but between the vagaries of the Electoral College and whatever October surprises the Trumpists cook up  #8212; you know they #8217;re coming  #8212; who knows? One thing that #8217;s clear, however, is that Republicans  #8212; not just Donald Trump, but his whole party  #8212; are acting as if there #8217;s no tomorrow. Or, more precisely, they #8217;re acting as if there #8217;s no next year. And this means that if Biden does win, he will have to govern in the face of what amounts to nonstop policy sabotage from his political opponents. To see what I mean about acting as if there #8217;s no next year, consider the large (and illegal) indoor rally Trump held Sunday in Nevada. Before the release of Bob Woodward #8217;s new book, you might have argued that Trump doesn #8217;t believe the science and didn #8217;t realize that his event might well sicken and kill many people. But we now know that he #8217;s well aware of the risks, and has been all along. He just doesn #8217;t care. Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. Or consider Trump #8217;s weeks of silence and inaction on the wildfires ravaging Western states. It #8217;s true that he won #8217;t win California, Oregon or Washington. But he #8217;s supposed to be the president of America, not just red states. Furthermore, those states account for almost 19 percent of the U.S. economy; you might think that he #8217;d care about the damage they #8217;re suffering, which will spill over to the rest of the country. But he clearly doesn #8217;t. For me, however, the most striking demonstration of Republican refusal to think ahead is the fact that nothing has been done to alleviate either the suffering of unemployed Americans  #8212; who lost much of the benefits that were sustaining them at the end of July  #8212; or the looming fiscal crisis of state and local governments. I read a number of business newsletters that try to offer guidance on future economic and policy developments; early in the summer just about all of them predicted that the Democratic House and the Republican Senate would reach some kind of compromise on economic relief. The unemployed would keep getting enhanced benefits, although less than the $600-a-week supplement they #8217;d been getting under the CARES Act; state and local governments would get significant help, although not as much as Democrats wanted. But there was no deal, just Trump executive memorandums that authorized some extra payments and a gimmick that has already fizzled. What happened? My interpretation is while Democrats passed a relief bill that was supposed to serve as a starting point for negotiations way back in May, Republicans dithered, held back both by hard-line right-wingers and by fantasies of a V-shaped economic recovery. And by the time they realized that their fantasies wouldn #8217;t come true, it was too late to take action that would have much impact on the election. So why bother doing anything? That is, it #8217;s as if Republicans don #8217;t expect to win, and they figure that if they do, they #8217;ll deal with the mess somehow. Now, a na #239;ve observer might expect politicians to consider the national interest, not just the political fortunes of their own party. But not these politicians, and not this party. All of this has ominous implications for the state of the nation in the months and perhaps years after the election. Suppose that Biden wins (which isn #8217;t a safe assumption) and that he does so without Trump and his supporters generating a hugely disruptive constitutional crisis (which is definitely not a safe assumption). Even so, there will still be two months during which Republicans hold both the White House and the Senate. Traditionally, departing administrations try to smooth the path for their successors. If you think that #8217;s going to happen this time, I have miles of new border wall, paid for by Mexico, that you might want to buy. What #8217;s actually going to happen, at best, is nothing: no actions to limit the spread of the coronavirus, no financial relief for families and local governments in crisis. And does anyone want to bet against the possibility of deliberate actions to make things worse? So if Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20, he #8217;ll be the second Democratic president in a row to inherit a nation in crisis, but this time one much worse than the one facing Barack Obama. And the troubles won #8217;t end on Inauguration Day. If Republicans still hold the Senate, they #8217;ll do everything they can to sabotage the new Biden administration. Remember, back in 2011 House Republicans held America hostage, threatening to force a default on the national debt unless Obama gave in to their demands. And that was the pre-Trump G.O.P.  #8212; already an extremist party, but not to the degree it is now. Things will be better if Democrats take the Senate as well as the White House. But Biden will still face constant obstruction. My guess is that whatever they say today, Democrats will eventually be forced to eliminate the filibuster, simply to make the nation governable. The point is that while a Biden victory, if it happens, will save American democracy from immediate collapse, it won #8217;t cure the sickness that afflicts our body politic."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump #8217;s fearmongering about violence and racial unrest has backfired, inuring more to his opponent #8217;s benefit than his own. (His problem is particularly acute among suburban women, who, according to one poll, favor Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden 55 percent to 41 percent and who trust Biden more to bring  #8220;law and order #8221; by a 52-to-42-percent margin.) Trump #8217;s view of the suburbs is badly out of date. Minorities including immigrants have streamed to the suburbia. Bloomberg reported last year that  #8220;today #8217;s suburbs no longer look much like the lily-white places portrayed on 1950s and 1960s sitcoms. Whites comprised less than ten percent of growth of the suburban population in America #8217;s 100 largest metros between the years 2000 and 2010. #8221; In short, when Trump says Biden  #8220;threatens #8221; to destroy the suburbs  #8212; meaning make them less White  #8212; he is decades late. Some individual neighborhoods in suburbia certainly are not well integrated, but non-Whites compromise a greater share of the suburbs than Trump #8217;s 1950 #8242;s-frozen politics recognizes. It might not be surprising then that a recent Monmouth poll shows,  #8220;Overall, about 3 in 4 Americans believe that having more racially integrated neighborhoods in their local communities is either very (41%) or somewhat (33%) important. #8221; The percentage who say it is very important is up five points from January. A blatantly racist pitch is not likely to win these voters over, in part because the suburbs include many non-Whites. Bloomberg reported last year,  #8220;Between 1970 and 2000, the share of African Americans living in suburban Atlanta increased from 27 percent to 78 percent; while in greater Washington D.C it rose from 25 percent in 1970 to 82 percent. #8221; The suburbs have been trending away from Republicans since Trump was elected. In 2016 Trump won the suburban vote 49 percent to 45 percent. By 2018 Democrats split the suburbs with Republicans 49 to 49 percent. Now, The Post reports the suburban vote is a major weak point for Trump:  #8220;Biden holds an 11-point lead among suburban voters in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Nevada, where the president appeared for a not-socially distanced rally last night, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday. #8221; This is in line with The Post #8217;s national polling:  #8220;A mid-August Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Biden winning the suburbs by 8 points. Suburban women support Biden by 13 points compared to a more even divide among men there. #8221; In key battleground states, Biden is also winning strongly among suburban voters. In a recent NBC/Marist Poll, 59 percent of suburban voters in Pennsylvania disapprove of Trump #8217;s performance with only 38 percent approving; when asked about their voting preference, suburban Pennsylvanians pick Biden by a nearly identical margin (58 to 39 percent). In polling in Wisconsin  #8212; the location of recent violence in Kenosha  #8212; Biden leads 48 to 43 percent. Part of the explanation for Trump #8217;s failure to win over suburbia is his choice of topic. The moderate group Third Way has been studying suburbia in a polling project that started in January. Co-founder and executive vice president Matt Bennett tells me,  #8220;The first question is what suburban voters, who will decide the election, worry about more: the economy and COVID or protests and violence. Our data indicate strongly that it #8217;s the former. #8221; That is one reason Biden is strenuously focusing on covid-19 and tying Trump #8217;s failure to address it to the recession. Unless something changes dramatically, Biden stands to win the suburbs  #8212; making a Trump victory nearly impossible. There simply are not enough rural White voters to carry Trump to victory, if Democrats maintain their lock on urban voters and hang onto gains in the suburbs."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "If a president in the performance of his duties lies or intentionally holds back vital information, Americans can die. That was the main takeaway from the Pentagon Papers, which showed multiple presidents understood we were not winning and could not win the Vietnam War but continued sending troops. History almost certainly will find an even more clear-cut example of mendacity in President Trump #8217;s decision to lie about the lethality of the novel coronavirus. We have his own words attesting to his knowledge of the virus #8217;s deadly effects, his confession that he downplayed the threat and reliable estimates of the tens of thousands of Americans who could have been saved had he acted swiftly and responsibly. Trump was certainly carrying out his duties as president (however poorly), so he #8217;s at no risk of criminal or civil liability. This was a moral failing. But what about activities that were specifically not official and were identified as campaign events outside his role as president? In June, Trump held a rally in Tulsa, at a time he knew the virus was airborne and deadly. He also recently held massive indoor rallies in Nevada and Arizona in which the audiences were tightly packed together and masks were not required. Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak was understandably furious, telling CNN #8217;s Erin Burnett:  #8220;He didn #8217;t care about the other thousands of people that were in there and the 3 million residents I have in the state of Nevada that are at potential of having disease transmitted because of what he did. #8221; He added,  #8220;He only cares about himself. #8230; He chose to show callous disregard in a reckless, selfish, irresponsible way. There is no other way to put it. #8221; Even some Republicans are nervous about Trump drawing crowds, according to a New York Times report: [The] decision to forge ahead created a wave of internal backlash, including from a top Trump adviser who said the president was playing a game of Russian roulette in holding the indoor rally. The adviser, who requested anonymity so as not to anger Mr. Trump, said the campaign was taking a cavalier approach to the pandemic that could backfire politically. Some of the president #8217;s most vocal defenders outside of the administration agreed.  #8220;Indoor rallies are irresponsible, #8221; Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush and a frequent defender of Mr. Trump #8217;s, wrote on Twitter.  #8220;Covid-19 is real and this was a bad idea. #8221; Xtreme Manufacturing, the company that put on the event in Henderson, Nev., was fined $3,000 for violating state restrictions on gatherings of 50 or more people. The owner of the venue declined to comment on the fine at a news conference but said it was his  #8220;patriotic duty to do what is right for our country, and what is right is supporting President Donald J. Trump. #8221; Another hotel he owns was previously fined more than $10,000 after hosting an  #8220;Evangelicals for Trump #8221; campaign event that  #8220;exceeded the state limit and also violated some city health restrictions. #8221; Should a repeat offender who knowingly violates health laws designed to prevent infection and death be held legally responsible for illnesses or deaths attributable to their functions? This would essentially be the same thing as a restaurant knowingly violating state food safety laws, resulting in the illness or death of its patrons. The only difference would be the challenge of proving causality (that the disease was contracted at campaign event). This raises questions about what accountability Trump and his campaign officials should face for events in which they crowd people into an indoor facility in violation of health state requirements. Remember: Trump is explicitly not acting in his official capacity at these events  #8212; these are campaign events paid for by his campaign. There is no shield of immunity that would prevent legal action after he leaves office and no federal pardon available for violations of state criminal law or for civil penalties. Criminal liability raises issues of intent (or reckless disregard for human life, the standard in homicides other than intentional murder) and causation. Civil liability raises other questions, including whether individuals assumed the risk of attending. Nevertheless, the law in principle does prohibit reckless endangerment of human life. Constitutional expert Laurence Tribe explains,  #8220;I think Donald Trump #8217;s deliberate exposure of people attending his rallies without masks and without social distancing, given all he has admitted on tape that he knows about how covid is transmitted and how deadly a virus it is, would qualify for state criminal prosecution. #8221; Tribe dismisses arguments that Trump #8217;s rallies are protected by the First Amendment by describing the events as more akin to  #8220;tossing firebombs into a crowded theater than merely shouting  #8216;Fire! #8217; when there is none and causing a deadly panic. #8221; He adds,  #8220;Trump is literally creating a situation in which his audience of thousands ought to be running for the exits to minimize the risk that they will at least become spreaders of a deadly virus but will instead remain in place while Trump holds their attention long enough to make many of them sick. That #8217;s civilly and criminally actionable as reckless endangerment, in my view. #8221; In any event, there is no reason for responsible governors to delay putting the president on notice. They should make clear that they will seek all available civil penalties (in addition to what litigants can obtain in private suits) and investigate any possible instances of negligent homicide in connection with events that willfully expose state residents to known, deadly health risks. That we are even discussing the liability of the president for willfully exposing people to a deadly disease is shocking. But remember, this is a small part of his decision to withhold information that could have saved tens of thousands of lives. In essence, he has been exposing Americans since February to the risk of infection and death for his own personal benefit. The families of nearly 200,000 dead Americans will not forget, and neither should the rest of us."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump faces reelection in about a month and half, with his coronavirus response dragging him down and a growing number of former aides and allies speaking out against him in extraordinary ways. But none of them combines those two things like the latest person to speak out, which makes her easily one of the most significant witnesses to date. Olivia Troye is Vice President Pence #8217;s recently departed homeland security adviser, and as The Washington Post #8217;s Josh Dawsey reports, she #8217;s stepping forward to make her case against Trump. She does so from a unique vantage point: She was involved in many of the White House #8217;s internal discussions on the coronavirus pandemic. Troye said she organized and participated in every meeting of the coronavirus task force, which her former boss chairs, between February and July. And her description of what she heard is as bleak as many critics of the pandemic response have suggested  #8212; if not bleaker. Among Troye #8217;s allegations: - She directly blames Trump and his administration for the size of the outbreak and the number of deaths, which now total nearly 200,000. She points particularly to Trump #8217;s unwillingness to embrace mask-wearing  #8212; which advisers have  #8220;repeatedly begged #8221; him to do  #8212; and to his preoccupation with the economy. Troye says Trump demonstrated a  #8220;flat-out disregard for human life #8221; because his  #8220;main concern was the economy and his reelection." - She describes an often completely unengaged Trump who spends task force meetings focused on other issues and going off on sometimes-lengthy tangents. She said he once spent 45 minutes complaining about insufficiently Trump-friendly Fox News hosts.  #8220;He spent more time about who was going to call Fox and yell at them to set them straight than he did on the virus, #8221; she said. - She says Trump #8217;s public pronouncements about things like hydroxycholoroquine routinely blindsided the officials who worked with him and often ran directly counter to what he had been briefed on. - She says everyone came to be afraid of disagreeing with Trump because they were routinely thrown  #8220;under the bus. #8221;  #8220;Instead of being focused on the task at hand, people were constantly wondering what was going to drop next or when you #8217;re going to get reprimanded or cut out of a process for speaking out, #8221; she said. - She went so far as to say that people should be skeptical of a vaccine if it #8217;s released before the election, because of the kind of political pressure she saw being brought to bear. Troye also says in a video for the outside group Republican Voters Against Trump that he once said,  #8220;Maybe this covid thing is a good thing. I don #8217;t like shaking hands with people. I don #8217;t have to shake hands with these disgusting people. #8221; She said the quote stuck with her because it defined Trump #8217;s approach to the virus. As with anyone who inserts themselves into these matters so shortly before an election, Troye #8217;s motives will be attacked. She acknowledges that she didn #8217;t vote for Trump in 2016, but she says she has voted for Republicans consistently throughout her life and opted to join the Pence team because she accepted Trump #8217;s election and wanted to help. She was also a loyal and long-running participant in the White House #8217;s response, by her own account. That included participating in Pence #8217;s infamous Wall Street Journal op-ed in June downplaying the idea of a coronavirus second wave  #8212; even as the outbreak was indeed resurging across the country.  #8220;It was ludicrous, #8221; Troye now says, but she helped write it. She also expressed regret for not being more aggressive internally to help right the ship on the response. Despite that criticism, Troye has positive things to say about her former boss, saying Pence  #8220;was in an impossible situation #8221; with Trump and that Pence privately did the  #8220;right things. #8221; And notably, she doesn #8217;t blame Trump for everything; she says the slow ramp-up in testing, for example, wasn #8217;t his fault. Her version is also important for one big reason: She has hardly been the attention-seeking type in the past. Having spent her career behind the scenes, she acknowledges fear about what is ahead for her.  #8220;Honestly, I am scared, #8221; she said.  #8220;I have never done anything like this. #8221; The fact that people in these lower-profile positions are putting themselves on the line is a continually important point. Indeed, Troye isn #8217;t completely alone in speaking out against the administration #8217;s coronavirus response from an internal perspective. A former top aide at the Department of Homeland Security, Elizabeth Neumann, also cut an ad last month for the RVAT. Neumann, who was assistant secretary for threat prevention and security policy, offered criticisms similar to Troye #8217;s. She said that existing pandemic plans were disregarded and that  #8220;from January until March 11, what you saw instead was a number of good public servants attempting to do their job and the president telling them to stop, because he didn #8217;t want the economy to tank and he didn #8217;t want a distraction from his campaign. #8221; She added that Trump had  #8220;absolutely failed. #8221; Another former top DHS aide under Trump, Miles Taylor, has leveled explosive allegations on other topics. While Neumann #8217;s job meant she was involved, Troye was consistently bearing witness not just early in the outbreak, but through its resurgence this summer, when virtually every other First World country had things much more under control. She saw up-close how Trump handled it  #8212; and how he didn #8217;t. She may not bring the heft of former defense secretary Jim Mattis or former national security adviser John Bolton, who also have criticized Trump of late. But she #8217;s speaking to something  #8212; on the record  #8212; from a similarly significant vantage point. And she paints an utterly devastating picture."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: PRESIDENT TRUMP [caps in original] tweeted Thursday that the presidential election results  #8220;may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED #8221; because of the  #8220;new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots. #8221;  #8220;RIGGED ELECTION in waiting, #8221; he exclaimed in another tweet. This is not the first time Mr. Trump has cast doubt on the legitimacy of a vote that polls indicate he is likely to lose, and it will not be the last. Rather than internalizing the notion that the coming election is likely to be fraudulent  #8212; which experts adamantly insist is not the case  #8212; Americans must take every such utterance as more evidence of the president #8217;s underlying goal: to discredit and deny their choice, if they are to eject Mr. Trump from the White House. Typically, it doesn #8217;t pay to be distracted by every outlandish presidential tweet. But Mr. Trump #8217;s repeated insistence that he can lose only if there is fraud must be called out for what it is: un-American, antidemocratic hogwash. Mr. Trump is spinning his fiction around one fact: Because of the covid-19 pandemic, more people than usual will vote by mail this year. Polls show that Democrats are more likely to do so than Republicans, so Mr. Trump might appear to be ahead in the count on election night in some key states. Then it will probably take days to count absentee ballots. The president will no doubt allege fraud as his lead diminishes or disappears. He may be abetted by powerful Republicans who have aided his nefarious effort already. Attorney General William P. Barr has repeatedly speculated  #8212; without evidence, he admitted  #8212; that foreign governments might print up masses of fraudulent ballots. In an interview published in the Chicago Tribune last week, Mr. Barr warned of widespread  #8220;selling and buying votes. #8221;  #8220;Someone will say the president just won Nevada.  #8216;Oh, wait a minute! We just discovered 100,000 ballots! Every vote will be counted! #8217; Yeah, but we don #8217;t know where these freaking votes came from, #8221; Mr. Barr said. In the same interview in which he sought to discredit the mail-in balloting that several states use exclusively and have for years without major incident, Mr. Barr accused  #8220;liberals #8221; of  #8220;creating an incendiary situation where there will be loss of confidence in the vote. #8221;  #8220;Our democracy #8217;s enemies, foreign and domestic, want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent, #8221; Daniel Coats, Mr. Trump #8217;s former director of national intelligence, wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Thursday.  #8220;No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome. Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations, #8221; he wrote. No need to name the leader he had in mind. Mr. Coats then endorsed an idea we proposed previously:  #8220;a supremely high-level bipartisan and nonpartisan commission to oversee the election #8221; that would monitor voting and vote counting and  #8220;confirm for the public that the laws and regulations governing them have been scrupulously and expeditiously followed  #8212; or that violations have been exposed and dealt with. #8221; Congress should empanel an election commission. If it does not, senior statesmen should form one on their own. Former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama would be natural leaders for such a panel. And Americans should understand that there is nothing untoward if many people vote by mail  #8212; and if the result of their voting is not confirmed on election night."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: byMAx Boot "My heart is breaking today. Not just because of the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg  #8212; one of the great pioneers in American legal history  #8212; but also for what her death could portend: a further delegitimization of our already fragile political institutions. I hope against hope that the great justice #8217;s passing does not worsen the crisis of our democracy. But I fear that it will. The United States has grown more disunited for years, with less and less that Democrats and Republicans can agree on. Even basic facts are in dispute in the age of Facebook and Fox News, with roughly 40 percent of the population trapped in an alternative reality bubble where immigration is an existential threat but global warming isn #8217;t. Conspiracy theories and  #8220;fake news #8221; have proliferated  #8212; and millions and millions of Americans believe them. President Trump has accelerated those terrible trends. He routinely accuses his political opponents of treason, calls the press the  #8220;enemy of the people, #8221; says any election he does not win is fraudulent and claims the civil service is part of a  #8220;deep state #8221; plotting against him. He does not even make any pretense of caring about states that didn #8217;t support him. Defending his coronavirus record, he said:  #8220;If you take the blue states out, we #8217;re at a level that I don #8217;t think anybody in the world would be at. #8221; That kind of poisonous talk takes a toll. A Pew Research Center survey last year found that only 45 percent of Democrats and just 38 percent of Republicans say they share any  #8220;values and goals #8221; with members of the other party. A new Pew Research Center poll finds that few Biden or Trump voters have friends who support the other candidate. Serious scholars are worried that if present trends continue, we could see significant unrest and violence far beyond even today #8217;s already alarming levels. Sociologist Jack A. Goldstone and scientist Peter Turchin developed a model tracking social unrest. They predicted a decade ago, based on growing levels of income inequality and self-interested behavior by American elites, that  #8220;the U.S. was heading toward the highest level of vulnerability to political crisis seen in this country in over a hundred years, #8221; with those trends  #8220;set to peak in the years around 2020. #8221; What Goldstone and Turchin call the  #8220;Turbulent Twenties #8221; are here with a vengeance. Now, they predict, the United States is  #8220;headed for still greater protests and violence #8221;: - Inequality and polarization have not been this high since the nineteenth century. Democrats are certain that if Donald Trump is reelected, American democracy will not survive. Republicans are equally certain that if Trump loses, radical socialists will seize the wealth of elites and distribute it to undeserving poor and minorities, forever destroying the economy of the United States. Both sides are also convinced that the other side intends to change the democratic  #8216;rules of the game #8217; in ways that will make it impossible for them to compete effectively in future elections. The Supreme Court has traditionally been the one institution that safeguards the Constitution and upholds neutral  #8220;rules of the game. #8221; Its legitimacy, though battered by years of Republican efforts to stack the court to achieve the party #8217;s desired political outcomes, remains intact largely because some Republican appointees such as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. have put principle above politics. Democrats are hardly blameless for the politicization of the court (Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) had to apologize for saying that Trump #8217;s appointees would  #8220;pay the price #8221; for voting against abortion rights), but their actions have been considerably less harmful than those of the other side. Two acts, in particular, have done great damage to the court #8217;s legitimacy. First was the 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling, on what amounted to a party-line vote, handing the disputed presidential election to George W. Bush. The second was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell #8217;s (Ky.) refusal in 2016 to even give a hearing to a moderate judge, Merrick Garland, nominated by President Barack Obama. McConnell excused his obstructionism by inventing a rule that nominees should not be considered in an election year. He held the seat open until Trump could nominate Neil M. Gorsuch. Imagine how much greater will be the damage if McConnell now flip-flops and tries to force through a replacement for Ginsburg either just before, or just after, an election that his party may well lose. Already two of the five conservative justices were nominated by a president who lost the popular vote. And George W. Bush, who lost the popular vote when he was elected to his first term, went on to nominate two more in his second. Imagine if a sixth conservative is nominated by a president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes and confirmed by Republican senators who represent 15 million fewer Americans than their Democratic colleagues. Imagine further that this new justice is the deciding vote on abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act  #8212; and even the outcome of the presidential election. The result would be a political crisis that will shake our institutions to their foundations and make our current predicament seem paradisal by comparison. Don #8217;t go there, Sen. McConnell, if you care at all about the republic and not just the Republican Party."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Back in 2016 and early 2017, Fox News was the self-satisfied home to a great deal of principled thinking about the importance of the American people #8217;s will. Here, for example, was Laura Ingraham, voicing her approval of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell #8217;s machinations to bypass Obama nominee Merrick Garland and get conservative justice Neil M. Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court bench after Trump #8217;s election:  #8220;The last 70 years, a Supreme Court justice was not confirmed in the final year of a president #8217;s term, #8221; preached the future Fox host, then a frequent guest on  #8220;Hannity. #8221; She fretted that it  #8220;doesn #8217;t matter #8221; to left-leaning partisans. This was lofty-sounding but wrong: To pick just one of many examples to the contrary, the Democratic-controlled Senate unanimously confirmed President Ronald Reagan #8217;s nomination of Anthony M. Kennedy in early 1988, an election year. Fox hosts Sean Hannity and Dana Perino, too, signaled their approval of stonewalling Obama #8217;s nomination pick.  #8220;You know, it #8217;s interesting  #8212; what goes around, comes around, #8221; Hannity opined, mentioning McConnell #8217;s citation of the supposed  #8220;Biden rule #8221; to justify the move.  #8220;Why should the Republicans act There was no such rule, though: Joe Biden, as a senator from Delaware in 1992, had been discussing, in a 1992 speech,  #8220;a hypothetical situation involving a voluntary resignation, not a death, that never came to pass, #8221; as Matt Gertz of Media Matters pointed out. Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us more than enough Such high-mindedness was in short supply during Fox #8217;s popular opinion segments on Friday evening. While Fox #8217;s news team gave ample attention to the life and career of the just-deceased Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and TV news across the spectrum discussed the likely next maneuvers in filling her vacancy, nothing was as raw as the comments by conservative activist Ned Ryun.  #8220;This is an opportunity, and I say they seize the moment, #8221; urged Ryun, founder of the grass-roots candidate-training factory American Majority, in an interview with Fox News #8217; Tucker Carlson, barely an hour after news broke of Ginsburg #8217;s death. For his part, Carlson did have the grace to suggest it might be well to tone things down in those initial hours and wait a bit to respect Ginsburg #8217;s memory. But he also threw doubt on a credible report that Ginsburg had expressed her  #8220;most fervent wish #8221; that the next president would appoint her replacement.  #8220;It #8217;s hard to believe, and I #8217;m going to choose not to believe that she said that, because I don #8217;t think that people on their deathbeds are thinking about who #8217;s president. You hope not  #8212; that #8217;s a pretty limited way to think as you die. But certainly this will be used as a cudgel by the left. #8221; The problem is that her words, according to NPR #8217;s reporting, were not uttered in her final hours but a few days earlier in a conversation with her grandchild. Fox News, though, wasn #8217;t the only place to find tortured logic and misrepresentations.  #8220;Ted Cruz with an excellent point, #8221; tweeted Marc Thiessen, the American Enterprise Institute fellow and Washington Post columnist.  #8220;If election is litigated can #8217;t risk having just 8 justices and the possibility of a deadlocked court. Could cause a constitutional crisis. #8221; There were thousands of retweets and likes, but a number of people who pointed out that Cruz and Thiessen seem to have short memories. After all, there was an ideologically split eight-member court in November of 2016  #8212; for the very reasons discussed above. (Also, if you #8217;re worried about a constitutional crisis, how about an election settled with the help of a justice Trump just appointed?) In coming days, you can be sure to hear and read about such things as the  #8220;Thurmond rule, #8221; the  #8220;McConnell Rule, #8221; the  #8220;Biden rule #8221;  #8212; none of which exist in law, and sometimes not even in writing. At most, they are conventions, not rules. (According to the Brookings Institution, Strom Thurmond, the longtime senator from South Carolina who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, is credited with an  #8220;unwritten admonition #8221; that  #8220;in presidential election years, the Senate should stop processing judicial nominations around the time of its summer recess, perhaps with limited exceptions for clearly non-controversial nominees. #8221;) There #8217;s no reason to think that the pro-Trump media and right-wing politicians will have a monopoly on self-serving justification in coming days. It #8217;s likely to be a dysfunctional circus. The media  #8212; of all stripes  #8212; could keep from making it worse by maintaining a level tone, by not twisting the facts for the sake of partisanship, and by pushing back against misrepresentations. Based on the initial hours after Justice Ginsburg #8217;s death, that #8217;s going to be an unreasonably high bar."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden gave his most compelling speech of the campaign Sunday, blowing away the notion that the Republicans #8217; effort to jam through a confirmation to fill the seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in any fashion a plus for the right. Rather, in a soberly delivered speech, Biden demonstrated why this newest wrinkle in the race serves as a boost to Democrats #8217; chances in winning the Senate majority and the White House  #8212; and ultimately reversing any damage two-faced Republicans would do in the meantime. Biden accomplished several essential tasks. First, like Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats earlier Sunday, he formulated that the open seat boils down to preserving the Affordable Care Act.  #8220;In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court trying to strip health-care coverage away from tens of millions of families. This took away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions, #8221; Biden said.  #8220;If he succeeds, insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for people living with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, cancer and so many other problems. #8221; The former vice president continued that  #8220;if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from covid-19  #8230; like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition. #8221; Biden did mention other issues such as abortion and voting rights, but plainly he is folding the fight over the court seat into the two best issues for him  #8212; Trump #8217;s failure to handle the pandemic and his attempts to take away health-care coverage. Second, he put the fight in simple terms of fairness. Republicans think they can make up rules and rewrite them for their benefit without regard to  #8212; indeed, despite  #8212; majority opinion. Bullying your way through fights with nonsensical blather to disguise your motives is antithetical to democracy. Biden stressed over and over again that voting is already underway, which means Trump is disenfranchising voters who want a say in the next justice. Third, Biden made the most of his ability to appeal to the most persuadable senators while sending a message to moderates and disaffected Republicans that he intends to end the cycle of inflammatory partisanship.  #8220;I #8217;m not speaking to President Trump, who will do whatever he wants. I #8217;m not speaking to Mitch McConnell, who will do what he wants, and he does, #8221; Biden said, acknowledging these men are beyond reason and utterly shameless.  #8220;I #8217;m speaking to those Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what is right for the country  #8230; not just what #8217;s best for their party. #8221; That would be Republicans such as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and any others with a speck of intellectual honesty: -To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power, and I don #8217;t believe the people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has already made it clear this is about power. Pure and simple.  #8230; Action and reaction. Anger and more anger. Sorrow and frustration at the way things are in this country now politically. That #8217;s the cycle that Republican senators will continue to perpetuate if they go down this dangerous path they have put us on. -We need to de-escalate  #8212; not escalate. That #8217;s why I appeal to those few Senate Republicans  #8212; the handful who will really decide what happens. Please, follow your conscience. Don #8217;t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don #8217;t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty  #8212; your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. That message, delivered in sober and quiet terms, is one that less partisan Americans are hungering for.  #8220;We can #8217;t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances, #8221; Biden said. That #8217;s precisely what voters who want to end the downward spiral of incendiary politics want to hear. Here is someone who understands that authoritarian power plays tear the country apart. Toward the end of his remarks, Biden again drove that message home, promising relief from the insane, mean-spirited partisanship Trump has adopted.  #8220;I #8217;ve said it many times in this election. We are the United States of America. There #8217;s nothing we cannot do if we do it together, #8221; he said.  #8220;Donald Trump wants to divide this nation between red states and blue states. Between representing those states that vote for him and ignoring those that don #8217;t. I do not, I cannot, I will not be that president. I #8217;ll be a president for the whole country. For those who vote for me and those who who vote against me. We need to rise to this moment, for the sake of our country we love. #8221; Fourth, Biden gave the best explanation for why presidents should not resort to lists of judges, pointing out that this Trump gimmick is also an assault on our democratic norms.  #8220;First, putting a judge #8217;s name on a list like that could influence that person #8217;s decision-making as a judge  #8212; and that would be wrong. #8221; In addition to setting the nominee up for  #8220;unrelenting political attacks #8221; without the ability to respond, putting together a list unilaterally violates the fundamental process of advice and consent.  #8220;Only after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate  #8212; and seeking their advice and asking for the consent, #8221; Biden said.  #8220;I will consult with senators in both parties about that pick, as well as the legal and civic leaders. In the end, the choice will be mine and mine alone, but I will consult. But it will be the product of a process that restores our finest traditions  #8212; not the extension of one that has torn this country apart. #8221; Finally, he signaled quietly to the left that Republicans #8217; chicanery will not stand. Liberals over the weekend poured out their grief, anger and defiance as they honored their icon, donating millions, gathering at memorials and vowing to fight for RBG as she fought for them.  #8220;That moment is now for the voters to get a chance to be heard  #8212; and their voice should be heard. And I believe voters are going to make it clear  #8212; they will not stand for this abuse of power, #8221; he said.  #8220;There #8217;s no discussion about what happens if the Senate confirms  #8212; on eve of election  #8212; or in a lame duck after Donald Trump loses  #8212; a successor to Justice Ginsburg. #8221; He need not make the argument that the consequences will be far worse for Republicans than failure to steal another seat; activists, pundits and Democratic candidates can do that. With an open seat, however, Biden can seal the deal with ex-supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who now understand the stakes and Biden #8217;s ability to prevent their worst nightmares from coming to fruition. When he says that  #8220;this nation will continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but we should not only be inspired by her, we should be guided by her, #8221; the left hears that they must fight like RBG, with tenacity and purpose. In short, Biden managed to appeal both to the left and the exhausted middle of the electorate. He framed the issue as one of fairness and of the ACA #8217;s survival. And he made clear that responsibility for further destruction of our system rests with Republicans, who can choose to pull back. In many ways, it was the most intricate and multilayered speech of his career. It certainly was the most presidential."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Any day now  #8212; perhaps as early as Tuesday  #8212; the number of U.S. deaths from the coronavirus will officially hit the staggering total of 200,000. Yet at a rally on Monday night, President Trump said this about the virus:  #8220;It affects virtually nobody. #8221; This juxtaposition captures more than just Trump #8217;s depraved indifference to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans. It also illustrates why his  #8220;October surprise #8221; strategy of dangling a possible vaccine before or just after the election will almost certainly fail. The public debate over Trump #8217;s vaccine strategy has typically focused on his efforts to corrupt the vaccine approval process and the ways this will backfire by making it less likely that voters will believe him if he does go through with such an announcement. But there #8217;s a more fundamental reason this will likely fail for Trump. It #8217;s this: Whenever a vaccine is introduced, a long and complex process will follow that will require sustained, engaged, non-megalomaniacal presidential leadership, all conducted in the national interest, a concept Trump cannot begin to fathom. In short, even if Trump were to get public credit for an imminent vaccine, it #8217;s likely the public would not trust him to manage what comes next. Trump #8217;s embrace of miracle cures Trump #8217;s vaccine strategy rests on spinning illusions. His own health experts predict that a vaccine won #8217;t be widely available until mid-2021 at best. But in dangling Election Day as a rough target for an initial rollout, Trump is trying to create the impression of imminence. Reelect him and we #8217;ll promptly get a vaccine, and he #8217;ll complete his spectacular routing of the virus that he has already mostly crushed. But Trump #8217;s problem is that he has long obsessed publicly over miracle cures. Whether it #8217;s hawking hydroxychloroquine like yet another two-bit Trump scam, or vowing the virus will go away in  #8220;warmer #8221; weather, or literally claiming it will vanish  #8220;like a miracle, #8221; Trump has promised for months that this or that will make it disappear, even as he continues dismissing it as largely defeated by his towering leadership. Many voters will likely see any vaccine announcement through this prism. He will again be promising an insta-victory over the virus, and many will understand that this actually reflects badly on his fitness to manage the process that must follow.  #8216;No fairy-tale ending #8217; First of all, even once we get a vaccine, we #8217;ll still need to use all sorts of other techniques to limit the virus #8217;s spread, according to Tom Frieden, a physician and former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  #8220;There #8217;s no fairy-tale ending to this pandemic, #8221; Frieden told me.  #8220;We #8217;re going to be dealing with it for a long time, even if we have a vaccine. #8221; Frieden added that even a safe and effective vaccine  #8220;is not going to make the virus disappear, #8221; noting that  #8220;we #8217;re still going to have cases and clusters, #8221; and  #8220;we #8217;re still going to need to mask and contact-trace. #8221; Frieden stressed that these challenges are all the more likely precisely because we don #8217;t know a lot about how to handle the vaccination for something like covid-19.  #8220;There are still a huge number of unknowns, #8221; Frieden told me.  #8220;We don #8217;t know if the vaccine is going to work. We don #8217;t know if it #8217;s safe. We don #8217;t know which vaccine will work better than the other. We don #8217;t know which groups will be protected. #8221; The next president will need to oversee  #8220;a coordinated national process for rolling out the vaccine, #8221; Frieden said, adding that billions of federal dollars will have to be made available to state and local governments to plan their end of this process,  #8220;and it #8217;s not there. #8221; Then there #8217;s the need to distribute the vaccine. Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, tells me this will entail a  #8220;massive and very complex logistical and production operation to get that vaccine in sufficient scale into people #8217;s arms. #8221; This will require the next president to  #8220;work with the private sector in an effective way to incentivize the production of that vaccine, #8221; Konyndyk continued, while showing an understanding of how supply chains can produce  #8220;all the constituent materials you need to get this vaccine into distribution. #8221; All these complexities will also have to be communicated to a public that #8217;s already deeply skeptical of Trump #8217;s intentions on this front. Indeed, the very fact that he continues treating the vaccine like a pending cure-all miracle itself betrays the traits that will likely lead countless Americans not to trust him to handle this rollout.  #8220;He #8217;s always just trying to make the sale, #8221; Konyndyk told me, citing Trump #8217;s real estate past.  #8220;He #8217;s not about solving a complex problem. He just wants to get you to sign on the dotted line. #8221; Finally, as economic historian Adam Tooze points out, the development of a vaccine will raise a host of global challenges in terms of coordinating intra-governmental and multinational pharmaceutical cooperation, and distributing it in poor and developing countries. The United States should play an active role. But Trump is snubbing the World Health Organization, which suggests more leadership abdication ahead. We are interested in hearing about how the struggle to reopen amid the pandemic is affecting people's lives. Please tell us yours. Trump continues to undermine the possibilities of international cooperation. He continues to mock the mask-wearing and social distancing we #8217;ll need to keep going even after we get a vaccine. He has long told the states (which must be equipped for its rollout) to fend for themselves in getting medical equipment. He has screamed at governors in ALL-CAPS TWEETS to reopen their states despite public health needs. And he refused for months to sufficiently work with the private sector to help marshal supply chains in service of a serious national response  #8212; yet he #8217;ll have to interact with it effectively to get the vaccine distributed. Why would voters trust Trump to handle such a complex and consequential series of processes going forward, after all we #8217;ve been through?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "The notion that Republicans will  #8220;win #8221; and capture the Supreme Court for a generation by jamming through a highly partisan justice during an election on a strictly partisan vote is preposterous. It will simply be the starting gun in a race to dismantle the Supreme Court as we know it. Remember that the agenda for the right on the Supreme Court is to subvert overwhelmingly popular policies, such as access to legalized abortion. As soon as the Supreme Court strikes it down, Congress could pass a bill enshrining it in law, albeit after unrooting the filibuster. As for the court itself, the uneasy balance that has existed for decades  #8212; that each president gets a pick or two and that the Senate only occasionally blocks a nomination (Robert Bork being the sole example of a judge voted down in recent memory)  #8212; rests on restraint and comity that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) destroyed in denying President Barack Obama his pick and then jamming through President Trump #8217;s. If, as seems very possible, Democrats capture the White House and the Senate, there will be a radical remaking of the Supreme Court and its role in our system. Let #8217;s start with the basics. The Constitution gives the Supreme Court limited original jurisdiction. As stated in Article III:  #8220;In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. #8221; But this is a tiny portion of what the Supreme Court does. As the Federal Judicial Center reports:  #8220;Between 1789 and 1959, the Court issued written opinions in only 123 original cases. Since 1960, the Court has received fewer than 140 motions for leave to file original cases, nearly half of which were denied a hearing. The majority of cases filed have been in disputes between two or more states. #8221; The Supreme Court #8217;s jurisdiction in all other cases  #8212; the ones we commonly associate with the court  #8212; are controlled at the complete discretion of Congress. (Per the Constitution:  #8220;In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. #8221;) The Supreme Court has huge, wide-ranging jurisdiction because Congress granted it, not because of some constitutional preordained scheme. The next Congress could, for example, decide that the Supreme Court will have no jurisdiction concerning the constitutionality of federal statutes. Congress could create a separate court for that or simply allow circuit courts to reach their own decisions. (The notion of having different laws in different circuits is not unprecedented. The Supreme Court does not take every case in which circuit courts have disagreed.) Congress could peel off other classes of cases  #8212; e.g., the constitutionality of state laws, disputes between Congress and the executive  #8212; as well. Conservatives in the 1970s and 1980s, increasingly worried about an imperial Supreme Court, considered all sorts of measures to limit jurisdiction (e.g., taking away school busing cases). A highly partisan Supreme Court widely viewed as politically driven could find itself with rather little to do. That is only one change that a new Congress might enact. The Post #8217;s Editorial Board and many others have suggested limiting the term of Supreme Court justices. Back in 2014, Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute wrote: - With a Court that is increasingly active in overturning laws passed by Congress and checking presidential authority when there is a president of the opposite party, that means nominations both to appeals courts and to the Supreme Court have become increasingly divisive and polarized, for both parties. And the policy future of the country depends as much on the actuarial tables and the luck of the draw for presidents as it does on the larger trends in politics and society.  #8230; For more than a decade, I have strongly advocated moving toward term limits for appellate judges and Supreme Court justices. I would like to have single, 18-year terms, staggered so that each president in a term would have two vacancies to fill. Doing so would open opportunities for men and women in their 60s, given modern life expectancies, and not just those in their 40s. It would to some degree lower the temperature on confirmation battles by making the stakes a bit lower. And it would mean a Court that more accurately reflects the changes and judgments of the society. The Supreme Court could also be expanded by two or even four justices. The number of justices is a matter of statute, subject to the will of Congress. Since the Merrick Garland stunt, former attorney general Eric Holder has supported this approach.  #8220;If, in fact, they are successful in placing a justice on the court, #8221; Holder said recently,  #8220;we need to think about court reform. And at a minimum, as part of that reform package, I think additional justices need to be placed on the Supreme Court. #8221; To achieve some or all of these reforms, Democrats will probably need to do away with the Senate filibuster unless their wins in November are enormous and a few Republicans can be persuaded to strike a deal. Having destroyed even the patina of independence and of fair play, Republicans would be in a poor position to scream foul. And even if they do, I am certain a substantial majority of Democrats in the House and Senate will shrug, smile and proceed ahead. (Without the filibuster, a whole list of other measures can be passed, including a statute ensuring abortion rights and funding without the Hyde Amendment restrictions under any government health-care program, securing voting rights, admission of new states, etc.) The mistake that Republicans make is thinking there is some permanent victory they can obtain in defiance of popular will that is increasingly hostile to their agenda. As undemocratic as our system has become, a substantial majority of voters can ultimately work their will by electing a president and congressional majority of their liking."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The Atlantic #8217;s Barton Gellman has written a horrifying account of President Trump #8217;s well-developed plans to sabotage the legitimacy of a presidential election that seems to be going against him. The U.S. electoral system, it turns out, has disturbing gray areas and no authoritative referees, making it surprisingly vulnerable to a ruthless violator of democratic norms. Trump appears to have the means and the intention to contest mail-in ballots, to claim massive electoral fraud, to muddy outcomes in battleground states and to refuse any form of concession. It is a strategy designed not to win an election but to invalidate its results and hold on to power through fraud. This is the context in which Trump has repeatedly refused to affirm that he would accept a loss in the 2020 election. Often it is advisable to ignore Trump #8217;s provocations, on the theory that some bait should be left untaken. Not this time. In this case, as Gellman shows, Trump is developing a mechanism to implement his destructive madness. We may be seeing the development of a presidential coup against American democracy. In the coming weeks, the country is likely to depend on the health and authority of three institutions. There is the judiciary, which may be the only accepted arbiter of an election outcome. There is the news media, which will need to shed light on shady maneuvering. And there is the U.S. military, which may be required to politely but firmly escort Trump off the White House grounds. By threatening the integrity of the 2020 election, Trump calls attention to the stakes of that election. Can there be any doubt that the president would be unleashed by winning a second term? Or that the U.S. system of government would be entering unexplored territory? We know Trump #8217;s governing daydreams because he talks about them out loud. He wants to jail Hillary Clinton. And the Bidens. And John Kerry, Adam B. Schiff, James B. Comey and John Bolton. He targets unfavored journalists for his Twitter mob. He wants to change libel laws to make it easier to harass and silence his opponents. He has threatened the  #8220;licenses #8221; of broadcast news organizations. He promises disproportionate punishment for government officials, business leaders and private citizens who criticize or defy him. And he believes that the power of the state should be at his personal disposal. In his first term, Trump has been largely prevented from pursing such dreams. The Mueller report is filled with instances where White House staff simply ignored his lawlessness. Even his first White House counsel and first attorney general occasionally opposed his malicious, vengeful whims. Trump was able to help some of his felonious friends (such as Roger Stone and Michael Flynn), but he was generally prevented from persecuting his enemies beyond smears and taunts. Yet several elements are now in place that would empower Trump #8217;s vindictiveness in a second term: -Trump has relentlessly weeded out responsible counselors from his presence and conducted a four-year talent search for bootlickers. One of the winners is Trump #8217;s second attorney general, William P. Barr  #8212; deceptive spinner of the Mueller report and generalissimo in the Battle of Lafayette Square. Under Barr, the Justice Department has become more politicized and responsive to Trump #8217;s urges. -In implementing his lawless instincts, the reelected president would bask in the support of his preternaturally loyal political base. If tens of thousands of unnecessary covid-19 deaths haven #8217;t shaken supporters #8217; belief in Trump #8217;s leadership, they are certainly not going to balk at a little score settling. Many would find it exciting. And Trump #8217;s evangelical Christian supporters would likely give the whole exercise the veneer of religiosity. -In a second term, Trump would have a compliant Republican Party. And by  #8220;compliant, #8221; I mean the unsurpassed cowardice and sycophancy of a pathetic political generation. -Trump would also have air cover from a state-run television network  #8212; or, at least, the functional equivalent of one. Fox News is less an alternative news source than an alternate reality, in which Trump is always in the right. No other U.S. president has enjoyed such a biddable instrument of media influence. -And Trump would have a range of ready-made enemies  #8212; the  #8220;deep state, #8221; antifa, migrants, Muslims  #8212; to justify the expansion of his power. These enabling influences could turn a fool into a menace to the rule of law. The alarming methods we are seeing Trump adopt in pursuit of reelection are a preview of his governing style in a second term. Given that opportunity, the president would be uninhibited, unhinged and unbound. If McConnell is not able to jam through a confirmation before the election, all of these reforms and more will be on the table in the lame duck session. A president-elect Biden, armed with an incoming Senate majority, would be in a strong position to lay out the future of a diminished and defanged Supreme Court should Republicans jam through a nominee after a sizable election loss.  #8220;The GOP is in the process of landing a devastating one-two punch on the credibility of the Supreme Court, #8221; says Norman Eisen, former counsel to Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment process. By refusing to consider the nomination of Garland in 2016 and now flip-flopping to force through another nominee in an election year, Eisen argues, Republicans would have  #8220;tainted #8221; two of the nine seats and therefore the court itself. He adds:  #8220;The Democratic leadership of the House and the Senate have made clear that any and all remedies should be on the table if this proceeds, and that is right. Adding additional seats, re-examining the scope of the court #8217;s jurisdiction (to the extent constitutionally permitted), imposing stringent ethics requirements like the ones that apply to all other judges nationally, enhancing Court transparency and much more should be carefully evaluated if this appointment goes forward. #8221; The permutations and possible outcomes are endless, but two things are not up for debate. First, Democrats will need a convincing win to achieve any of these measures, not to mention the rest of their agenda. An army of Ruth Bader Ginsburg admirers marching to the polls can increase their chances of a convincing victory. Second, let #8217;s stop the silly moaning that  #8220;Republicans cannot be stopped #8221; or that  #8220;the right will own the Supreme Court for decades. #8221; Nonsense. Ultimately, the people decide  #8212; and there is every reason to believe that the people have no stomach for a Republican world in which millions lose health-care coverage, abortion is criminalized in many states, LGBTQ rights are undone, states can eviscerate voting rights and the executive branch gets a free pass to do whatever it pleases. November will become a referendum not only on all these issues, but on the Republican effort to impose minority rule of overwhelmingly White conservative states on the rest of the country."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (shortened for length): "In a uncommon act of courage, James D. Herbert, an assistant U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, wrote a letter published in the Boston Globe taking Attorney General William P. Barr to task for his  #8220;unprecedented politicization of the office of the attorney general. #8221; What is extraordinary is not that Herbert went public with these well-founded accusations but that so few others in the department have done the same. Herbert #8217;s list of particulars includes a  #8220;misleading summary of the Mueller report #8221; and  #8220;selective intervention in cases against political allies of the president, #8221; a reference to his interference in the prosecutions of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and presidential fixer Roger Stone. Herbert lists other offenses, including Barr #8217;s accusation that racial justice advocates use victims of police abuses such as George Floyd as  #8220;props. #8221; Most important, Herbert condemns Barr for  #8220;baseless claims about mail-in ballots #8221; and for doing Trump #8217;s  #8220;bidding at every turn #8221; and bringing shame on the department. In the spirit of Herbert #8217;s words, I #8217;ve written another open letter, this time directed to attorneys at the Justice Department who remain silent: Dear Justice Department attorneys: You have sworn an oath to the Constitution, which requires the equal administration of laws and the peaceful transfer of power through popular elections. As members of the bar, you have also taken on the obligation to, among other things, make arguments in court that are grounded in law and fact, refuse to  #8220;make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal #8221; and, per Justice Department guidelines, keep cognizant that "public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles above private gain. #8221; Your professional and constitutional obligations are more than words on the page. Failure to abide by these principles undercuts not merely your personal integrity but also your standing as a member of the bar. Your conduct now will define your personal reputations and future legal careers. Let #8217;s begin with an under-appreciated fact. It is likely there will be a new president in January, and any action, conversation, memo and pleading in which you were involved over the past nearly four years is bound to come to light. The Justice Department #8217;s ethics office will have a complete record of your conduct, as will the public, parties in legal actions in which you participated, judges, state bar authorities and future employers. If you are counting on anonymity to shield scrutiny of your actions, you have made a grievous mistake. As you well know, you have a professional and legal obligation to alert courts to misstatements of fact and law you made either intentionally or accidentally. If you have not already done so, I would strongly urge you to do so immediately with regard to any court proceedings to which you have been a part under this administration. Better to have come forward voluntarily than for it to be discovered later that you or anyone else have misled the court and covered up wrongdoing by the department. With regard to the current election, you are surely aware that the recent Justice Department statement regarding a small number of discarded ballots in Luzerne County, Pa.  #8212; subsequently withdrawn and revised  #8212; was a serious departure from the agency #8217;s policy not to confirm, let alone comment on, an ongoing investigation. As the New York Times reported: -Election experts said the announcement was highly irregular. Justice Department policy calls for keeping voter fraud investigations under wraps to avoid affecting the election outcome, and the experts said it was almost unheard-of for the department to provide an update on the case and disclose the name of the candidate for whom the ballots had been cast. - #8220;The question of who voters voted for would be immaterial in any kind of tampering investigation, and it seems to be in there for political reasons, to bolster the president #8217;s arguments that the election is being rigged against him, #8221; said Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. Disclosure of how the ballots were cast  #8212; a fact that had to be corrected  #8212; was especially egregious and appeared designed to corroborate the scurrilous narrative advanced by Barr and President Trump that mail-in ballots are illegitimate and subject to widespread fraud. Longtime Republican election lawyer Ben Ginsberg told The Post,  #8220;There #8217;s a big difference between what happened in Luzerne County and systemic fraud that says you can #8217;t trust the result of the election. #8221; The Post #8217;s report continued:  #8220;Ginsberg said the Luzerne irregularities  #8216;absolutely #8217; warrant investigation, but he also said officials need to distinguish between willful fraud and a simple mistake. #8221; At issue here is the deliberate misuse of the Justice Department to undermine the legitimacy of a presidential election and potentially provide the president with an excuse for refusing to abide by the election #8217;s results. Nothing could be more destructive to the department and our democracy  #8212; let alone your professional reputation. Your obligations are clear. First, you must preserve all documents  #8212; including email  #8212; that might shed light on misuse and politicization of the Justice Department. You must refuse orders to destroy and/or tamper with evidence. Second, you must speak out publicly when incidents like the one in Pennsylvania occur. You can go to members of Congress or to the media to report misconduct. Third, you must categorically refuse to participate in efforts to politicize and misuse the department #8217;s powers during the election. Fourth, you must support state authorities who retain responsibility for conducting the elections. You must support their efforts to adhere to established law and procedures concerning tabulation, counting and certification of ballots."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Where the shore meets the sea, in the hours just before or just after a storm, you may find, flung over the sand, tufts and pillows of green-brown foam. These almost weightless remnants tell of wild and turbulent activity out on the deep. But onshore, the froth deflates and what abides is the permanent sea, rocking back and forth against the beach. So what is foam, and what is sea in the presidential campaign of 2020? As a candidate in 2016 and as president ever since, Donald Trump has shown himself to be among the strongest foam-stirring storms in U.S. political history. Evidence of his hurricane is blown across every newscast and newspaper; every controversy and conversation, every morning and every night. But for all the froth spread over social media and television, the permanent sea  #8212; the slow rise and fall of public opinion  #8212; has told one story relentlessly. The RealClearPolitics rolling average of countless polls going back for a year  #8212; long before the start of the pandemic  #8212; tolls the knell of Trump. Even in January, when the stock market blazed to new records and unemployment fell to rare depths; when the Democratic impeachment project was in shambles and Trump looked triumphant  #8212; even then, if one ignored the foam and studied only the sea of public opinion, one saw that Trump was four percentage points behind. Trump's tweets telling minority congresswomen to  #8220;go back #8221; to their countries follows a history of racism and nativism. Voters will decide if this is effective. (Joshua Carroll, Kate Woodsome, Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) People say: Wait! Remember that Trump won in 2016 while losing the popular vote. He #8217;s a magician whose dark arts can #8217;t be measured in conventional ways. Perhaps. But Trump has never won like this. Not from four points behind, six points behind, eight points behind, 10 points behind. That #8217;s where he has been, without exception, according to RealClearPolitics, for more than a year. Never fewer than four points back, sometimes trailing by double-digits. Trump #8217;s unconventional convention in August was a bold attempt to reverse the tide. Having posed before Mount Rushmore during Fourth of July celebrations (without stirring a wave), the president scoured the national capital region for additional patriotic backdrops for his nomination speech, including Fort McHenry of  #8220;Star-Spangled Banner #8221; fame and the White House itself. Across four nights of television, every stumble and humiliation of the Trump presidency was recast with an alternative history. Trump #8217;s pandemic response has been masterful. He has a special knack for bringing people together. He has a secret plan for law and order. The sea just shrugged. Polling averages remained essentially unchanged, with Trump trailing by five to seven percentage points. With fewer than 40 days remaining in the race, the president is down to his last chances to stir a sea change. If his daily havoc just blows weightlessly down the beach, and if his grand spectacles fail to make waves, what #8217;s left? The debates, especially the first one on Tuesday, could close the gap. Trump supporters are hoping desperately that Democratic nominee Joe Biden will lapse into a senior moment under the glare of the nation #8217;s scrutiny, or that he will somehow reveal himself to be the puppet of the same left-wing that he trounced in winning the Democratic nomination. Biden could blow the debates. He is not an especially strong candidate. I #8217;ve been watching him run for president since 1987  #8212; a year in which the Bangles #8217;  #8220;Walk Like an Egyptian #8221; topped the charts. He hasn #8217;t delivered a single great debate performance. More likely than disaster, though, is a series of draws. The former vice president will surely be well prepared, ready to parry Trump #8217;s haymakers with jabs at Trump #8217;s own vulnerabilities: on health care, on Social Security funding, on management style. The president will be tempted to deliver his usual performance borrowed from pro wrestling and  #8220;reality #8221; TV: blustery, aggressive, exaggerated, taunting. It will delight his base, which is already delighted, while annoying the larger public that is plumb tired of the chaos. In other words, more foam. Millions of early votes will be cast by the time the third and last debate concludes on Oct. 22. If the tide of public opinion hasn #8217;t turned in Trump #8217;s favor by then, his last chance to alter the outcome will come through the voter-turnout competitions already underway. Democrats enjoy a distinct advantage  #8212; if they can avoid the lax overconfidence that doomed Hillary Clinton #8217;s 2016 campaign. That deep sea of public opinion has Biden well-positioned in a long list of states won by Trump last time: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona. Polls suggest that he #8217;s in striking distance in Republican strongholds such as Georgia, Iowa and even Texas. Biden has a dozen ways to win if his team puts in the work. Trump must go to the same states that elected him and win nearly all of them again. He #8217;s running out of time."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Now that the New York Times has broken the explosive news that Donald Trump paid a scant $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017  #8212; and that Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 out of the 15 preceding years  #8212; it provides an occasion to reconsider one of the biggest scams Trump has been perpetrating on the American people for years now. I #8217;m not talking about the scam that Trump was a good businessman, or that a good businessman will be a good managerial president, though both have long been central to Trump #8217;s game, and this new expos #233; leaves that game in ruins. Rather, I #8217;m talking about a scam that #8217;s more fundamental to the Trumpist mystique. It #8217;s the idea that someone with extensive inside experience in milking a system rigged to enrich elites like him is uniquely positioned to either (in the more charitable telling) un-rig that system for the benefit of all or (in the less charitable one) unlock its spoils for supporters who place him in a position of power to do so. The Times expos #233; strips the sheen off Trump #8217;s image-making like so much imitation gold leaf. We learn that Trump evaded income taxes for many years largely through his epic financial losses. While Trump scooped in hundreds of millions of dollars off  #8220;The Apprentice, #8221; he dumped those profits into a series of big-league money losers that he owned and ran himself. All of this shows that Trump is simply  #8220;pouring more money into many businesses than he is taking out, #8221; the Times observes, which  #8220;exposes the  #8220;hollowness #8221; behind the  #8220;self-made-billionaire image. #8221; Urgent questions But those massive losses also allowed Trump to largely avoid paying federal income taxes on his profits from  #8220;The Apprentice #8221; and other licensing deals, which might otherwise have amounted to more than $100 million, per Times calculations relying on the effective tax rate paid by the top 1 percent. We also learn that Trump #8217;s revenues from  #8220;The Apprentice #8221; are  #8220;drying up, #8221; and that in the next few years, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans will come knocking. And the Internal Revenue Service is auditing a questionable trick Trump used to claw back $72.9 million in taxes he #8217;d paid by getting the amount refunded, another way he kept his income tax burden almost nonexistent. These revelations raise urgent questions. Trump #8217;s vulnerability to hundreds of millions of dollars in loans coming due could tempt him to bend policy decisions to steer foreign loans his way, making him a  #8220;national security threat, #8221; as Timothy L. O #8217;Brien argues. There #8217;s also the matter of to whom he owes all that money. And Trump #8217;s massive personal stake in his battle with the IRS raises questions about how far he #8217;ll go in wielding his control over the executive branch  #8212; of which the IRS is a part  #8212; to his own personal benefit, which he has done in all kinds of other ways. Many have insisted this won #8217;t hurt Trump with his base, who will see it as another sign of his shrewd mastery: All this just shows how screwed up the system is. Trump did only what the system lets people like him get away with. That #8217;s my guy! But this actually points to a serious hidden vulnerability for Trump. The stories Trump tells Trump campaigned in 2016 on a version of exactly that idea: He understood how elites have rigged the system on their own behalf for so long, having milked that system himself for years. Trump openly boasted that he had bought off politicians himself, so he knew how financial elites corrupted them, and claimed that not paying taxes  #8220;makes me smart. #8221; Crucially, both were offered as reasons to vote for the outsider businessman who would put that inside knowledge to work for America. In short, Trump held it up as a selling point that he enriched himself off a system rigged to enable such elite gaming. He insisted this showed that  #8220;I #8217;m the one that knows how to change it, #8221; as he put it at one debate. The beneficiaries would be the American people, or perhaps just his people, his supporters, who were implicitly offered a cut of the spoils as part of the bargain in backing him. But this mystique relied both on fictions about his business acumen, and on keeping the operational details of all this elite gaming hidden. Note that Trump boasted about not paying taxes while also refusing to release his tax returns to keep voters in the dark about how he did this. What makes the Times expos #233; so powerful is that it reveals the truly sordid nature of all this self-dealing and grift, as well as the fact that he relied on it to compensate for truly epic levels of incompetence and failure. And meanwhile, what did those smarts get for the country? The massive corporate tax giveaway, his biggest  #8220;accomplishment, #8221; only facilitated the very sort of elite rigging and self-enrichment Trump vowed to undo, without even spurring promised job-creating investment. All that acumen produced perhaps the greatest elite managerial policy fiasco in modern times, helping lead to over 200,000 Americans dead and a tanked economy. That, plus the carnage from his trade wars, has left Trump reduced to literally inventing numerous auto factory openings that never happened. Perhaps many Trump voters will see these revelations as more evidence of his wizardry. But wavering voters are likely to see them in the context of all his other failures. Taken together, they constitute another multifaceted proof point in what a dreadful miscalculation it was to take a flyer on the Trumpist experiment."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "During the first presidential debate in 2016, Hillary Clinton speculated that Donald Trump was keeping his taxes secret because he didn #8217;t want Americans to know that  #8220;maybe he #8217;s not as rich as he says he is, #8221;  #8220;maybe he #8217;s not as charitable as he claims to be, #8221; and maybe  #8220;he #8217;s paid nothing in federal taxes. #8221; The New York Times just confirmed that Clinton was right  #8212; and reveals why President Trump has tried so hard to keep his taxes secret. It somehow managed to obtain Trump #8217;s tax returns, which show that he is either a terrible businessman or a massive tax cheat  #8212; or possibly both. He managed to pay no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years  #8212; and only $750 in 2016 and 2017  #8212; by claiming vast losses from his business empire. That $750 figure is a killer because it #8217;s a number that middle-class Americans can understand. As a just-released Biden campaign ad points out, that #8217;s far less than the taxes paid by the average teacher, nurse or firefighter. The latest Times story neatly complements a previous Times scoop in 2018 which showed that, far from being a self-made man, young Trump received $413 million from his father  #8212; and squandered it in a series of failed deals. The new article picks up the story, showing that Trump received another windfall from  #8220;The Apprentice #8221; and related deals  #8212; and then promptly squandered that, too. By July, the newspaper reports, the supposed billionaire had no more than $873,000 in securities left to sell. The Times article supports the assumption that Trump ran for president in 2015  #8212; a race he never expected to win  #8212; to revive his flagging fortunes. That is, in fact, what Trump #8217;s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, told Congress last year:  #8220;Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history. . . . The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity. #8221; Once Trump unexpectedly won, the marketing opportunities only increased for the most unethical president in our history. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) just released a report showing that Trump has 3,400 conflicts of interest. He has profited from his presidency by making repeated visits to his own properties with his vast entourage in tow, while lobbyists, political groups and foreign governments have also paid to stay at his properties. Trump tried to secure even more lucrative paydays by announcing that the Group of Seven summit would be held at his Miami-area golf resort and reportedly instructing the U.S. ambassador in London to pressure the British government to move the British Open golf tournament to his Scottish resort. Both schemes blew up in Trump #8217;s face, raising the issue of why someone as rich as he claims to be would engage in such blatant profiteering. Now, we know the answer. Trump is not just less wealthy than he claims; he is up to his eyeballs in debt. The Times reports that Trump is on the hook for $421 million in debt, much of which is coming due soon. As former FBI agent Josh Campbell points out, that much debt  #8220;disqualifies most people from obtaining a government security clearance, #8221; because the U.S. government  #8220;views this as a vulnerability and a point of leverage for foreign adversaries seeking access to classified information. #8221; The Times account did not specify who Trump #8217;s debtors are and sheds little light on his business connections with Russia. It did note that he made more money from holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013  #8212; $2.3 million  #8212; than from any other pageant. That money came from the Agalarov family, which is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and which lost $10 million on the transaction. This should serve as a reminder that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III refused to look into Trump #8217;s financial dealings with Russia, which Trump said was a red line for him. That investigation still needs to be conducted. But even the bare facts revealed by the Times show why both former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former director of national intelligence Daniel Coats suspect that (as Coats told Bob Woodward)  #8220;Putin had something on Trump. #8221; And Putin isn #8217;t alone. The Times shows that Trump made millions of dollars during his presidency from licensing deals in places such as the Philippines, Turkey and India, rendering him vulnerable to pressure from the strongmen in power in all of those countries. Indeed, former national security adviser John Bolton said that Trump #8217;s decision-making on Turkey was motivated by Trump #8217;s business interests. That is a shocking corruption of U.S. foreign policy. Will any of it matter? It #8217;s true that the Times #8217;s revelations are unlikely to move Trump #8217;s devoted supporters to vote for Joe Biden. But they do disrupt Trump #8217;s ability to get his message across with only 36 days left in an election that he is losing. The Times has done an impressive job of getting the truth out, and now it is up to the voters to decide whether they want to reelect a flimflam man. The Times account makes clear that Trump is desperate to stay in office in no small part because he needs to profit from the presidency  #8212; and to avoid the risk of prosecution for tax fraud and other possible crimes."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The bombshell New York Times report on Donald Trump #8217;s tax returns is a remarkable feat of journalism. The team deserves special praise for making their findings comprehensible to general readers, and not getting lost in the details. Yet like many other revelations in the Trump era, the tax news falls into the category of  #8220;shocking but not surprising. #8221; Many observers had already surmised that Trump paid little or no taxes, that his claims of brilliant business success were a fiction, and that he is deep in debt. Now all of that is virtually confirmed. But what does it mean for America #8217;s future? Everyone will come at this question from their own angle. When I read the Times report, I quickly found myself thinking about  #8230; the theory of business capital structure. No, really. For many people, no doubt, the main takeaway from the tax revelations will be  #8220;$750? Really? #8221; The fact that Trump paid less in taxes than tens of millions of hard-working Americans struggling to make ends meet is an outrage. It #8217;s also easy to explain in a few seconds, which is why it #8217;s the theme of a quickly released ad from the Biden campaign. From a substantive point of view, however, Trump #8217;s tax avoidance is less important than the confirmation of what many already suspected: His carefully cultivated image of being a hugely successful businessman is, as he would say, fake news. In fact, he has done a terrible job of running his businesses. Why does this matter? Voters often seem to believe that effective business leaders have the skills and knowledge to lead the nation as a whole. They #8217;re wrong about that. Even genuinely great businesspeople  #8212; people like, say, Herbert Hoover  #8212; are often very bad at public policy, including economic policy, because the skills needed to run a business and those required to steer a nation are very different. In Trump #8217;s case, however, the old joke is true: He isn #8217;t a great businessman, he just played one on TV. It should come as no surprise, then, that he has been consistently hapless at devising policy. On just about every front, from diplomacy to infrastructure to trade wars to fighting a pandemic, he has been Midas in reverse. How much will the revelation that he has always been a fraud hurt him? Many of his supporters will probably refuse to acknowledge the truth, perhaps because they won #8217;t admit to themselves how completely they were scammed. But assuming that the news will have no effect at all is probably too cynical. And remember, Trump is running behind Biden, so he has to do more than keep his base  #8212; and this may not do much to win over undecided voters. The most important revelation from the Times report, however, is its confirmation of another thing many observers already suspected: Trump has hundreds of millions in personal debt. It #8217;s unclear whether he has the resources to repay it. Personal financial trouble has always been a red flag when it comes to filling sensitive government positions, because it #8217;s an open invitation to corruption. So the confirmation that the nation #8217;s chief law enforcement and national security official  #8212; whose business empire already offers many opportunities for undue influence  #8212; is drowning in debt is chilling. Beyond that, analysts of business finance  #8212; I told you I #8217;d get there  #8212; have long known that high levels of debt, enough to pose a substantial risk of bankruptcy, create destructive incentives. Instead of investing in the future, the owners of highly indebted businesses are tempted to engage in asset stripping, getting the money out before the creditors stake their claims. This is, by the way, the charge being leveled at Eddie Lampert, the former chief executive of Sears (and Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury). Owners of debt-hobbled businesses are also tempted to take big risks, even at bad odds, because if they get lucky, they might save themselves; if they don #8217;t, it #8217;s someone else #8217;s problem. Heads they win, tails the creditors lose. So now we have a deeply indebted business owner with every incentive to engage in malfeasance  #8212; except that in addition to running his business, he #8217;s running the United States of America. But he may be about to lose that special position, and whatever financial defense it may provide. Think about that. Also think about the fact that Trump constantly complains about almost nonexistent voter fraud  #8212; he has never accepted the fact that he lost the popular vote four years ago  #8212; and that he has repeatedly refused to say that he will accept election results if he loses. And tell me that you aren #8217;t terrified about what the next few weeks may hold."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "In recent weeks, President Trump has been escalating his attacks on the election and our democracy. His increasingly authoritarian tilt and the post-election doomsday scenarios are terrifying and overwhelming. But we cannot let him suppress our rights as citizens and prevent us from voting in the election this year. It is easy to understand why people feel we #8217;ve reached a new low; even after four destabilizing, painful years, where chaos and calamity have reigned, nothing is beyond the imagination. Trump is using his platform to bully us into believing that our laws don #8217;t apply to him, to trash our democracy and to scare us into thinking our ballots won #8217;t be counted. But the record must be set straight: Here in the United States, we elect our leaders. We are a democracy, and Trump is not a king. If Trump loses this November, he will leave  #8212; as has been the case since John Adams replaced George Washington in 1797. Right now, the polls say Trump is losing the election. Fearful of losing, he is flexing power he doesn #8217;t have to discourage people from exercising the power they do. But Trump succeeds only if voters fall prey to his intimidation tactics and decide not to cast their ballot. We cannot let this happen. Every vote matters. And if in November the people say Trump must go, he will have to go. Authoritarian regimes take root when citizens give up on their democratic institutions as rigged and illegitimate; voters succumb to their fear of the party in power and choose to sit out. That #8217;s why it #8217;s vital to clarify what a U.S. president can and can #8217;t do. If Trump loses, and wants to say the election wasn #8217;t fair, he can say what he wants. But there is a system in place that he doesn #8217;t control. A sitting president wields no direct power when it comes to how Americans vote. In nearly every state, local boards of election count the ballots. State election authorities verify these counts. Governors or secretaries of state certify that the final tally is correct. The electoral college does not depend on the president accepting the results. And a new Congress in January counts the tally transparently. There are firewalls that separate this process from the president  #8212; firewalls he has no power to override. In addition, each state has security measures to ensure that votes cast are counted, whether they #8217;re cast by mail or in person. Ballots stay in the hands of local officials  #8212; whether cast at a polling location or filled out at a voter #8217;s kitchen table. This chain of custody ensures that local officials designated by state law to certify election results are the only ones who have access to the original ballots. These measures are not new; neither is voting by mail. Our armed forces first voted by mail during the Civil War, and states as different as Oregon and Utah are among those that conduct elections by mail fairly and effectively. Americans are already voting. And we aren #8217;t talking enough about that: In focusing on what can happen in the days and weeks following Nov. 3, we miss the opportunity to avert those bleak scenarios through high voter turnout. High turnout trumps everything. In 2000, the Supreme Court was important because the election came down to 537 votes. But the court didn #8217;t decide the election in 2004, 2008, 2012 or 2016. That #8217;s the difference between 537 votes and 10,000. The voters have the power to put this one out of the legal system #8217;s reach. Massive participation is the surest way to inoculate our democracy against authoritarian threats. The career officials of the federal government  #8212; including the military  #8212; took an oath to defend the Constitution, which entails responding to the person that we, the people, choose. At noon, on Jan. 20, 2021, the winner of the 2020 election will be inaugurated and those familiar with White House security procedures say that the Secret Service will escort anyone who doesn #8217;t fit that description off of the White House premises. Trump is far better at the art of distraction than understanding the powers  #8212; and limits  #8212; of the presidency. Every minute we spend talking about whether he is able to steal the election is one less that we #8217;re focusing on the reasons to send him packing: more than 200,000 dead from covid-19 due in part to his malfeasance and incompetence, the impacts of the pandemic on our economy and our children, our destroyed reputation abroad, barbaric immigration policies at home, the embrace of white supremacy and police brutality, and the list goes on. We don #8217;t expect Trump to welcome a fair contest. Trump is nothing if not a bully  #8212; and he could give a master class on sore losing. But the choice of who wins this year #8217;s election is not his to make. It #8217;s ours."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): President Trump did for the Tuesday debate what he has done for the political life of the country in his four years: supply as much rampaging volume, custom-busting obtrusion and outright fiction as necessary to impose his will on the proceedings. He declined to condemn white supremacy and let fly dark conspiracies about the voting process. He mocked Joe Biden #8217;s mask-wearing and intellectual firepower and seemed more interested in running against the caricature of his opponent than the man himself, once insisting that Mr. Biden supports defunding the police moments after the Democratic nominee made clear he did not. And with inveterate interruption and well-practiced grievance, the president complained incessantly about the unfairness of it all, ensuring that the conversation  #8212; even on a subject as universally experienced as the coronavirus pandemic  #8212; turned back to his personal feelings and treatment at nearly every opportunity. WHO WON? There was broad agreement among political observers on one thing: Whoever won, America lost.  #8220;Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job, #8221; Mr. Trump offered in one exchange, sprinkling his typical first-person praise with a bit of third-person.  #8220; #8216;President Trump did a phenomenal job, #8217; #8221; he repeated.  #8220;We did. #8221; He ticked through promises and boasts that strained credulity: about the velocity of vaccine availability, the lives he purportedly saved, the safety of his rallies, flashing more passion on the topic of Mr. Biden #8217;s academic record than a virus that has killed more than 200,000 Americans on his watch. Mr. Biden steered through an uneven rebuttal, recalling the president #8217;s sunny projections of a largely virus-free Easter before settling on his thesis for the night.  #8220;If you believe for a moment what he #8217;s telling you in light of all the lies he #8217;s told you about the whole issue relating to Covid, #8221; Mr. Biden said,  #8220;he still hasn #8217;t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening. #8221; WHAT WE LEARNED Here are six takeaways from the first debate between President Trump and Joe Biden. On some level, this has long been the basic tension at the core of Mr. Trump #8217;s quest to keep his job: Which undecided Americans  #8212; to the extent that there are very many  #8212; can be swayed by a president whose personal behavior and threadbare credibility have already disappointed wide swaths of voters he needs? Re-elections often reduce to this premise. The incumbent is dependable, or he isn #8217;t. He has earned the deference to keep at it for four more years, or he hasn #8217;t. But for Mr. Trump, with approval ratings that hover in the low 40s and polls showing a solid lead for Mr. Biden in battleground states, the task is especially pronounced. After a first term spent confidently telling untruths and trafficking in conspiracy theory  #8212; including persistently playing down the dangers of the pandemic, in public and in private  #8212; he has reverted to a familiar pitch. Believe me. I #8217;ve got this. And would you get a load of the other side? An insatiable self-evangelist and denier of realities that displease him, Mr. Trump invited viewers on Tuesday to embrace his preferred version of Trump-era events  #8212; a kind of executive happy place for the converted, where his reign has been spotless, the winning is bountiful and the virus has effectively been defeated. The goal before Mr. Trump, though, was not merely to delight his base  #8212; though there was plenty of that  #8212; but to persuade the unpersuaded and to bludgeon his opponent, at minimum disillusioning some who might be inclined to see Mr. Biden as the lesser evil. The president certainly tried. He moved to bind Mr. Biden to  #8220;socialist #8221; forces on the left. He said China  #8220;ate your lunch, Joe. #8221; And he took furious aim at Mr. Biden #8217;s own honesty, an issue on which the former vice president significantly outperforms Mr. Trump in voter surveys.  #8220;Joe, #8221; he said,  #8220;you #8217;re the liar. #8221; For four years, Mr. Trump has rarely strayed from the warm confines of his own informational bubble. Any exposure to the outside world  #8212; a White House news conference, a friendly media interview, a rally with adoring supporters  #8212; has generally gone forward on his terms. But on Tuesday, this was a picture of a presidency stripped to its studs: an unpopular incumbent unfurling an often dubious defense."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened a little for length): "The disastrous debate that unfolded in Ohio should prompt us to take the possibility that President Trump will try to steal the election far more seriously  #8212; even as it also renders that outcome much less likely to succeed. Trump exhorted his far-right army to mobilize for a sustained conflict over the election results. He refused to say whether he #8217;d accept a legitimate loss. And he confirmed he #8217;s expecting the Supreme Court to help invalidate countless legally cast ballots. It #8217;s this last point that presents a way to gauge Trump #8217;s chances of executing some version of his corrupt designs. The short version is this. At Amy Coney Barrett #8217;s confirmation hearing, Democrats can press a line of questioning that might illuminate whether Trump can pull off one of his most-discussed means for rigging the election: getting a GOP state legislature to appoint substitute pro-Trump electors to the electoral college, regardless of the popular vote in that state. Trump is telegraphing his scheme At the debate, Trump said he  #8220;can #8217;t go along #8221; with a result tallied up from millions of mail-in ballots, which will mean  #8220;fraud like you #8217;ve never seen. #8221; He urged supporters to  #8220;watch #8221; the voting  #8220;very carefully, #8221; i.e., to engage in voter intimidation. And asked what he expects of the high court and Barrett, Trump said:  #8220;I #8217;m counting on them to look at the ballots. #8221; Trump did also say he might not  #8220;need #8221; the court to settle  #8220;the election itself. #8221; But that only inadvertently confirms that he believes the court is at his beck and call on this matter. As far-fetched as it seems that a state legislature might appoint pro-Trump electors, it #8217;s important to note that some Republicans are already claiming that the fictional mass fraud in large-scale mail balloting could serve as the justification for doing just this. As one Trump legal adviser told the Atlantic, they might say:  #8220;We don #8217;t think the results of our own state are accurate, so here #8217;s our slate of electors that we think properly reflect the results of our state. #8221; And so, when Trump casts doubt on the legitimacy of a prolonged count after Election Day  #8212; as he did at the debate  #8212; he #8217;s opening the possibility of using exactly this justification for precisely this endgame. As Edward Foley outlined in a prescient 2019 article, if Trump were ahead in the Election Day count, he #8217;d likely put this scheme in motion while claiming  #8220;machine politicians in Philadelphia #8221; are trying to steal the election with fabricated mail votes. Could this work? To be clear, it shouldn #8217;t. The Constitution does assign to each state the authority to  #8220;appoint #8221; its electors, in a  #8220;manner #8221; that the legislature  #8220;may direct. #8221; But in a terrific piece, three legal scholars  #8212; Grace Brosofsky, Michael Dorf and Laurence Tribe  #8212; explain that precedent shows this means the legislature must  #8220;direct #8221; how the state appoints its electors by making laws that create and define the process for doing so. Virtually all states have made laws that provide for electors to be appointed in accordance with the popular vote outcome in them. (Maine and Nebraska do this by congressional district.) Thus, those scholars argue, legislatures can #8217;t appoint pro-Trump electors without making a new law providing for appointment of electors based on legislators #8217; own will, not that of the voters. Such a new law would require the governor #8217;s signature. And in three states where this appears most likely to be tried  #8212; Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin  #8212; Democratic governors would veto any such effort by GOP-controlled legislatures. The Supreme Court has upheld the principle that a governor can veto such an effort, those scholars note. In the 1932 case Smiley v. Holm, the court ruled that the Minnesota state legislature could not change election rules unilaterally in the face of such a veto. This ruling confirmed that for the court,  #8220;state legislatures cannot alter #8221; laws governing the selection of electors  #8220;except through their ordinary state lawmaking procedures, #8221; which would require a gubernatorial signature and be subject to veto, the scholars argue. So friendly legislatures can #8217;t do this on Trump #8217;s whim without a new law, no matter how loudly they scream that ongoing counting of mail ballots is fraudulent. Such a case might again find its way to the Supreme Court. But how would it rule? The question for Barrett Democratic senators can press Trump #8217;s nominee on this question  #8212; by asking whether she believes Smiley is settled law, and on whether she believes the Constitution does or does not allow state legislatures to appoint electors outside the lawmaking process. Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School, told me Barrett would likely evade this question, by merely promising to  #8220;respect precedent #8221; while declining comment on a question that might soon be before the court. Still, this might be worth trying. Given that Trump has explicitly said he expects the court  #8212; and Barrett  #8212; to help him pull off something like this, we #8217;re in an extraordinary situation. By confirming that Smiley is settled law, Barrett could strongly suggest that such an effort will fail, sparing the country from it.  #8220;She could certainly throw cold water on it, #8221; Dorf told me.  #8220;She could make it clear that she #8217;s not likely to be receptive to an argument #8221; that legislators can appoint electors without a new law. As for other justices  #8212; such as John G. Roberts Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch  #8212; they might also look askance at such an effort. In Bush v. Gore, the court described the process for appointing electors as a  #8220;legislative #8221; scheme. Dorf says they might see this as invalidating any effort to appoint them outside the lawmaking process. To be clear, Trump #8217;s disastrous debate performance makes it more likely Biden will win the  #8220;blue wall #8221; states by a comfortable enough margin that Trump won #8217;t even try such a scheme."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump has made it unmistakably clear in recent weeks  #8212; and even more crystal clear at the Tuesday debate  #8212; that there are only two choices before voters on Nov. 3  #8212; and electing Joe Biden is not one of them. The president has told us in innumerable ways that either he will be re-elected or he will delegitimize the vote by claiming that all mail-in ballots  #8212; a time-honored tradition that has ushered Republicans and Democrats into office and has been used by Trump himself  #8212; are invalid. Trump #8217;s motives could not be more transparent. If he does not win the Electoral College, he #8217;ll muddy the results so that the outcome can be decided only by the Supreme Court or the House of Representatives (where each state delegation gets one vote). Trump has advantages in both right now, which he has boasted about for the past week. I can #8217;t say this any more clearly: Our democracy is in terrible danger  #8212; more danger than it has been since the Civil War, more danger than after Pearl Harbor, more danger than during the Cuban missile crisis and more danger than during Watergate. I began my career as a foreign correspondent covering Lebanon #8217;s second civil war, and it left a huge impact on me. I saw what happens in a country when everything becomes politics, when a critical mass of politicians put party before country, when responsible people, or seemingly responsible people, think that they can bend or break the rules  #8212; and go all the way  #8212; and that the system won #8217;t break. But when extremists go all the way, and moderates just go away, the system can break. And it will break. I saw it happen. I would like to think that such a thing could not happen in America. I #8217;d like to think that  #8230; but I am very, very worried. I worry because Facebook and Twitter have become giant engines for destroying the two pillars of our democracy  #8212; truth and trust. Yes, these social networks have given voice to the voiceless. That is a good thing and it can really enhance transparency. But they have also become huge, unedited cesspools of conspiracy theories that are circulated and believed by a shocking  #8212; and growing  #8212; number of people. These social networks are destroying our nation #8217;s cognitive immunity  #8212; its ability to sort truth from falsehood. Without shared facts on which to make decisions, there can be no solutions to our biggest challenges. And without a modicum of trust that both sides want to preserve and enhance the common good, it is impossible to accomplish anything big.  #8220;Politics needs a reference point outside of politics, #8217; #8217; argues the Hebrew University religious philosopher Moshe Halbertal.  #8220;It needs values, it needs facts and it needs leaders who respect that there is a sacred domain of decisions that will never be used to promote political gain, only the common good. #8217; #8217; Public trust is eroded, added Halbertal, when people feel that this notion of the common good doesn #8217;t exist because everything has become politics. That describes the United States today. The institutions we have relied upon to be outside the game of politics so as to adjudicate what is right and true  #8212; scientists, certain news media, the courts  #8212; have become so ensnared by politics that fewer and fewer of them are universally trusted to define and pursue the common good. Even mask-wearing has become partisan. You cannot sustain a healthy democracy under such conditions. And that is why the only choice in this election is Joe Biden. The Democrats are not blameless when it comes to playing politics, but there is no equivalence to the Republicans. The Democratic Party sorted through all the choices, and, led by older Black men and women in South Carolina, rejected the Democratic socialist candidate and said they wanted a moderate unifier named Joe Biden. The Republicans  #8212; who in the past voted for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, sane conservatives who could be counted upon to uphold the common good  #8212; have done no such equivalent thing. They have fallen in line lock step behind a man who is the most dishonest, dangerous, meanspirited, divisive and corrupt person to ever occupy the Oval Office. And they know it. Four more years of Trump #8217;s divide and rule will destroy our institutions and rip the country apart. To me, the only hope for America is to elect Biden and split the G.O.P. between the Trumpists and whatever is left of the moderate Republicans, and then hope that a big center-left and small center-right can agree on enough things to propel the country forward, heal the divide and act together for the common good. Admittedly, Biden did not particularly shine in tonight #8217;s debate. Alas, I have never seen him shine in any debate. But I have no doubt that the people, values and integrity he would bring into government would be of a quality that the nation deserves. If Trump #8217;s monstrous performance left you feeling that you want four more years of his presidency  #8212; that he will respect the outcome of the election if it goes against him, that he will reunite the country, that he will do the presidency proud and surround himself with people of the quality that the country deserves  #8212; then you and I were watching different debates. To get back a semblance of unity and sanity, Biden has to win. And that is why I have only one answer to every question now: Vote for Biden  #8212; do it by mail early if you must, but if you can, please, put on a mask and do it in person. If enough of us do that, Biden can win outright with the votes cast on Election Day, instead of waiting for all the mail-in ballots to be counted, thereby giving time for Trump and Fox News to muddy the outcome. So help register someone to vote for Joe Biden. Phone bank for Joe Biden. Talk to your neighbor about Joe Biden. Volunteer for Joe Biden. Drive someone to the polls to vote for Joe Biden. Do it as if your country #8217;s democracy depends on it, because it does."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Ever since the start of the Trump presidency, his critics and opponents have often told themselves a morbid joke, one that functioned as a kind of dark coping mechanism. Whenever some particularly heinous outrage or terrible outcome came along, we #8217;ve said: With President Trump, it #8217;s just another day ending in  #8220;Y. #8221; Now that Trump and the first lady have tested positive for coronavirus, this formulation provides some guidance once again, albeit with a little twist. Let #8217;s wish the president and his family a speedy recovery, and hope fervently that those around him don #8217;t get sick. And then let #8217;s treat this outcome as just another reason atop a very large pile to keep working for his defeat, since it, too, reflects terribly on his handling of the worst domestic crisis we #8217;ve faced in modern times, in all kinds of ways. There #8217;s no reason to hit the pause button in any way. The presidential campaign must continue. Joe Biden shouldn #8217;t suspend his political activities. Journalists should not hesitate to press forward with the hardest and least polite questions about this, and by all indications, they are not. The emerging facts about the immediate situation are already incredibly damning. Most obviously, Trump #8217;s cavalier attitude toward the virus led him to minimize precautions to protect himself and others. Trump mocked Joe Biden for wearing a mask just this week at the debate. On Monday he declared that  #8220;we #8217;re rounding the corner. #8221; And in addition to constantly shunning masks himself, the New York Times notes that Trump #8217;s own aides  #8220;generally do not wear masks in deference to the president #8217;s disdain for them. #8221; The result? It #8217;s still unclear  #8220;how far the infection may have spread among senior White House officials. #8221; Worse, we #8217;re learning that adviser Hope Hicks, who #8217;s often in close proximity to the president, tested positive late Wednesday, and that the White House hoped to keep this from the public, a scheme that was foiled by dogged reporting. On top of that, The Post reports this: -After White House officials learned of Hicks #8217;s symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew Thursday to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters, at a roundtable event. -The president did not wear a mask Thursday, including at the events at his golf course and on the plane, officials said. Trump knew a close aide was infected, but interacted closely with dozens of people without a mask, anyway. Trump first tested positive on Thursday, but it #8217;s not clear exactly when, and he seems to have known he #8217;d likely been exposed before going forward with that schedule. And so, it #8217;s fair to ask whether Trump and his advisers had hoped he wouldn #8217;t develop symptoms, in which case they might not disclose the news. As more of the timeline gets filled in through aggressive reporting, we #8217;ll see that our accountability institutions are not letting up, as they should not. But really, all this is just one more mark on the ledger of a much broader indictment, in which Trump has just never felt any obligation to treat the virus as something worth caring all that much about, no matter how many people got sick and died of it. As The Atlantic summarizes: -Trump #8217;s mishandling of the coronavirus defines his presidency. He downplayed the severity of the disease, misled the country repeatedly about it, tried to pin the blame on local governments, did not  #8220;take responsibility at all #8221; for the anemic American response, held massive rallies against scientific advice, hammered on states to reopen before it was safe, rejected easy safety measures, and undermined trust in our public-health institutions. Trump was never going to protect the country from the virus. But ultimately he could not even protect himself. Yet the point here is not that it #8217;s  #8220;poetic justice #8221; that Trump himself has now become infected. Rather, it #8217;s that the very occurrence of this episode, and the handling of it, reflect a much broader series of failings that may be a bit more glaring today, but were in full existence yesterday. The virus exposed deep injustices This news also should remind us of the very profound systemic injustices this pandemic has exposed in our health system and economy. Trump benefited from daily testing, while telling the country that testing was  #8220;overrated #8221; to mask his failures to make it more available. Yet Trump abused this special access to testing by relying on it to stage numerous events without masks and social distancing, rather than setting an example for the country, because those things would send a message that undermined his reelection hopes. On this, his luck has now run out. But this only further dramatizes the risks of refusing to take masks and social distancing seriously, risks he refused to convey to the rest of the country. Trump also enjoys top notch health care. Yet even as he will benefit from this during his own convalescence, he and Republicans continue to support a lawsuit that would wipe away protections for tens of millions. And as this terrific Post piece documents, the recession unleashed by the pandemic is the most unequal in history, one that is hitting  #8220;poorer households harder, #8221; at a  #8220;scale that is the worst in generations. #8221; Yet Trump and Republicans still continue to resist a very generous economic rescue package. But all this is just as true today as it was yesterday, though it is perhaps dramatized a bit more vividly. And so, while we should wish Trump a speedy recovery, and assume he will recover, in so many other ways it #8217;s just another day ending in  #8220;Y. #8221; As such it constitutes more grounds to keep working fervently for his removal."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (Shortened for length): When asked to condemn  #8220;white supremacists and militia groups #8221; during his debate with Joe Biden this week, President Trump gave a largely garbled answer, asking for definitions and caveats, attempting to misdirect attention to leftist violence, and repeatedly interrupting the moderator. One part of his answer, however, was crystal clear.  #8220;Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, #8221; Mr. Trump said. Rather than condemn white power groups, Mr. Trump instead issued an unambiguous call to them to be ready. Watchdog groups and analysts have debated about how to classify the Proud Boys. Its members explicitly disavow white supremacy in a bid for respectability, but its ideology is clearly white supremacist: Photographs of members flashing the white power sign, the presence of members at white power events and at rallies and expert analyses of the group #8217;s online content make this clear. They should be seen as fellow travelers with white power groups and activists. Names and tactics vary, but the white power movement is united in ideology and intent. Its adherents include propagandists calling for the end of non-European immigration, those who carry out attacks mislabeled  #8220;lone wolf #8221; violence in places like El Paso, Pittsburgh, Charleston, S.C., and Christchurch, New Zealand, and groups that train secretly for war, like the Base, and even for nuclear war, like Atomwaffen Division. It also includes members of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi and racist skinhead groups, and large segments of the Boogaloo Boys and extralegal militias. This is why it is a mistake to understand Mr. Trump #8217;s statement as directed solely to the Proud Boys  #8212; which had, before the night was over, incorporated  #8220;Stand Back, Stand By #8221; into a badge logo. Other groups aligned with the white power movement will certainly interpret Mr. Trump #8217;s message as including them. This complex web has worked exactly this way since the late 1970s, with disastrous results. The white power movement is, in many ways, an incredibly diverse array of activists. I found in my research that though it is a fringe movement, its supporters represent a cross-section of American life: rich and poor and middle class; religious leaders and felons; men and women and children; people in cities and suburbs and rural areas. What binds these disparate groups is that they espouse the violent defense of white supremacy. They see the white race as under attack  #8212; from immigration, from the rise of the nonwhite population, and from the acceptance of multiculturalism by much of the nation. For them, defending the white race and white culture from these forces requires a violent attempt to stop the country #8217;s demographic changes. Some of them wish to provoke race war, overthrowing the nation itself. Others simply wish to attack immigrants and keep people of color from voting. But both positions unite in a war on American democracy. Before the debate, this attack on democracy itself was not fully clear to me, not even after a decade researching the earlier white power movement and several years watching its resurgence after the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. This movement declared war on the state, and especially the federal government, in 1983. It then embarked upon a series of violent acts, most notoriously the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. But there is something new today: The president and his administration are at war on the democratic process, as we see in his weakening of the Post Office and the credibility of mail-in ballots, in calls for  #8220;poll watchers #8221; that are clear invitations for intimidation, and in statements by Mr. Trump that cast doubt on his willingness to accept the results of the election. Not only does  #8220;Stand back and stand by #8221; fail to denounce and disavow white supremacist violence, it seems to be a call to arms and preparedness. It suggests that these groups, who are eager to do violence in any case, have the implicit approval of the state. The day after the debate, Mr. Trump claimed not to know who the Proud Boys were, and told them to  #8220;stand down. #8221; But even the most generous interpretation of his comments does not release Mr. Trump from accountability. The Proud Boys  #8212; some of whom were involved in the Charlottesville rally  #8212; should be well known to the president. And no matter what he says now, he can #8217;t unring the bell. The groups Mr. Trump declined to disavow will interpret attempts to clarify to be merely strategic denials. He did not, in his initial statement, specify a moment for which the Proud Boys ought to  #8220;stand by. #8221; But if Mr. Trump loses, they will surely move from  #8220;stand by #8221; to  #8220;engage, #8221; prepared to take violent action. If Mr. Trump wins, they will likely believe that they are an unofficial apparatus of state violence. Because of my research on the white power movement #8217;s history, I regularly hear from people sounding the alarm. They are advocates who try to deradicalize those attempting to leave white power groups. They are watchdogs that monitor white power internet activism. They are people at tech companies charged with flagging hate speech, and who are exhausted by the sheer magnitude of the task and the hatefulness they encounter. Many of these people predict increasing violence from now through the election, and after, regardless of winner. The white power movement has long sought not only to intimidate voters  #8212; which it has done  #8212; but also to inflict mass casualties. There is no reason to think that strategy will change. Criminal trials of its activists have often failed. Piecemeal responses to the coordinated recruitment of active-duty military personnel and other groups with similar expertise have not sufficiently stopped the flow of weapons, tactics, and training to these groups. We are decades, if not generations, into this problem. A call to arms like  #8220;stand back and stand by #8221; is nothing less than catastrophic."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "There is a great deal you have every right to expect at this moment of crisis, and no reason at all to believe that Donald Trump or his White House will provide it. You cannot expect this White House to tell the truth about Trump #8217;s health. His doctors have lied about the president #8217;s weight and height. They have never offered an adequate explanation of his sudden, unscheduled visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center a year ago. Even the fact that a close aide to the president had tested positive for the coronavirus was kept from the public until Bloomberg broke the news. You cannot expect the White House to produce any orderly plan for the execution of Trump #8217;s public duties, even to the very limited extent that Trump executed public duties in the first place. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was diagnosed with COVID-19 on April 6 of this year. Johnson formally deputed Foreign Minister Dominic Raab to preside over the government during his own incapacity. But the pattern in the Trump administration has been that the president will not and cannot do the job himself, and that he vengefully strikes down anyone who tries to do the job for him. Trump fired his most successful chief of staff, John Kelly, for trying to force him to work. Kelly #8217;s successor, Mick Mulvaney, survived by enabling Trump  #8220;to act as he chooses #8212;a recognition that trying to control Trump is a futile approach, #8221; as Polititico #8217;s Nancy Cook put it. Likewise, Vice President Mike Pence had better be awfully circumspect about filling the role that the Constitution and its Twenty-Fifth Amendment assign him. Trump will be watching. So long as Trump is conscious, he will not allow it; should he lose consciousness, he will retaliate when and if he recovers. You cannot expect the White House to exhibit any regard for the health of others. The president knowingly exposed his wife, his adult children, his staff, his donors, and his supporters in the Cleveland debate hall. He refused and forbade the most basic safety precautions in the close quarters of the West Wing and on Air Force One, except for testing, which was intended to protect him personally. On Tuesday, Trump was on the debate stage mocking former Vice President Joe Biden for wearing face masks; as the positive tests came in, he did not bother to inform Biden or his team that Trump had exposed him to the coronavirus. Until we know the date of Trump #8217;s last negative COVID-19 test, we can only guess at the number of people he exposed. By sticking to an aggressive travel schedule with in-person gatherings while eschewing even minimal safeguards, Trump has carried the risk of disease across the country. You cannot expect Trump to gain any wisdom, empathy, or compassion for others. Throughout the pandemic, Trump has disdained the hardships suffered by sick and dying Americans, by their families and neighbors, by those who have lost jobs and homes. When NBC #8217;s Peter Alexander asked Trump on March 20 what the president would say to Americans feeling fear because of the disease, he upbraided Alexander:  #8220;I #8217;d say you are a terrible reporter. #8221; When Republican Senator Mitt Romney self-isolated because he had been exposed to COVID-19 by the negligent selfishness of Senator Rand Paul, Trump sarcastically said to reporters,  #8220;Oh, that #8217;s too bad. #8221; It #8217;s a consistent pattern for Trump; on October 2, 2016, four years ago to the day of Trump #8217;s COVID-positive acknowledgment, Trump cruelly pantomimed onstage Hillary Clinton #8217;s campaign-season bout of pneumonia. What you can expect is a lot of victimhood and self-pity. Trump and those around him have always demanded for themselves the decencies that they refuse others. They will get them, too. Trump #8217;s opponents will express concern and good wishes #8212;and if they do not, Trump #8217;s allies will complain that those opponents are allowing politics to overwhelm human feeling. It was only three days ago that Trump on a debate stage derided Biden #8217;s dead son, Beau, and falsely claimed that Biden #8217;s surviving son, Hunter, had been dishonorably discharged from the Army. The next day, Trump #8217;s eldest son, Donald Jr., appeared on Glenn Beck #8217;s show to describe Hunter as a  #8220;crackhead. #8221; Now, though, we will hear a lot about how people are not being respectful enough to a president in his time of illness. Trump has all his life posed a moral puzzle: What is due in the way of kindness and sympathy to people who have no kindness and sympathy for anyone else? Should we repay horrifying cruelty in equal measure? Then we reduce ourselves to their level. But if we return indecency with the decency due any other person in need, don #8217;t we encourage appalling behavior? Don #8217;t we prove to them that they belong to some unique bracket of humanity, entitled to kick others when they are writhing on the floor, and then to claim mercy when their own crimes and cruelties cast them upon the floor themselves? Americans are dead who might have been alive if Trump had met the challenge of COVID-19 with care and responsibility #8212;or if somebody else, literally almost anybody else, had been president instead. Millions are out of work, in danger of losing their homes, living in fear. Tens of millions of young people have suffered disruption to their education, which will follow them through life. The pandemic was not Trump #8217;s fault, but at every turn, he made things worse than they had to be #8212;because at every turn, he cared only for himself, never for the country. And now he will care only for himself again. Trump should never have been allowed anywhere near any public office. Wish him well, but recognize that his deformed spirit will never be well #8212;and that nothing can be well for the country under his leadership."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (shortened for length): "WASHINGTON  #8212; President Trump #8217;s announcement on Friday that he had contracted the coronavirus upended the presidential race in an instant, leaving both sides to confront a wrenching set of strategic choices and unexpected questions that will help shape the final month before Election Day. As the president boarded Marine One to fly to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment, his aides announced that they were suspending his campaign events and those of his family members, who are his most ubiquitous surrogates. Privately, his top advisers expressed shock at the turn of events and hope that Mr. Trump #8217;s symptoms would remain mild and he could at least begin appearing on television next week. At the same time, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump #8217;s Democratic rival, disclosed that he had tested negative for the virus and said he would continue to campaign, beginning with a previously scheduled campaign trip on Friday to Michigan. With Mr. Biden already leading in the polls, and Mr. Trump #8217;s electoral prospects dependent on his ability to campaign, the president has little time to change the trajectory of the race. The fate of his re-election bid increasingly seemed to hinge on his own health  #8212; and whether he will able to overcome the disease and persuade voters to give him another four years. The split-screen between the candidates on Friday represented a striking reversal from the last few months, during which Mr. Trump pushed on with his rallies and belittled Mr. Biden for adhering to health protocols and running a  #8220;basement campaign. #8221; The former vice president was careful to avoid anything that could be perceived as exploiting the situation Friday; at an appearance in Grand Rapids, Mich., he did not criticize Mr. Trump for his handling of the virus, and closed his remarks by calling on God to  #8220;protect the first family, and every family that is dealing with this virus. #8221; Mr. Biden #8217;s campaign also moved to take down negative television commercials Friday that lashed Mr. Trump for his handling of the virus, according to a Democratic official familiar with the ad traffic. And Mr. Biden #8217;s campaign manager, Jennifer O #8217;Malley Dillon, emailed the entire campaign urging its members to  #8220;refrain from posting about the situation on social media. #8221; Mr. Biden #8217;s aides said he had no plans to step away from his travels  #8212; at least for now. The president #8217;s illness is certain to keep the coronavirus pandemic front and center in the remaining weeks before the election, a development that would appear to favor Mr. Biden, whose campaign message is focused on criticism of Mr. Trump #8217;s stewardship of the deadly disease. In the White House, advisers to the president acknowledged that the positive test would remind voters of how dismissive Mr. Trump had been about the virus, not only with the neglect of his own safety but also in his overly rosy assessments about a pandemic that has killed more than 208,000 Americans. Mr. Trump #8217;s recklessness, one adviser acknowledged, amounted to a political  #8220;disaster. #8221; For all the drama 2020 has delivered, the presidential race has been largely impervious to even momentous events, whether it was impeachment, the virus, unrest over racism and severe economic distress. Mr. Biden has enjoyed a steady lead in the polls since effectively claiming the nomination in April. But an incumbent president testing positive for a potentially deadly disease is of a greater order of magnitude. Republicans worried on Friday that Mr. Trump would have to remain in the hospital for a significant period of time, imagery they fear would be damaging at a moment when millions of Americans are already voting. G.O.P. officials were also concerned that a race with very few undecided voters would freeze in place. Multiple party strategists said their polling in the two nights after the presidential debate had revealed substantial slippage, and not just at the top of the ticket.  #8220;This limits Trump #8217;s opportunity to turn this thing around and drive a winning message, #8221; said Terry Sullivan, a Republican consultant.  #8220;He #8217;s lost any ability to control the narrative. #8221; Should the final weeks of the campaign be dominated by the coronavirus, Mr. Trump #8217;s challenge will be intensified by his casual approach to the disease and its deadliness. The president spent months disregarding and mocking the basic precautions, such as wearing a mask, that his health advisers were urging Americans to take to protect themselves. Still, few Democrats had any degree of confidence on how the final weeks of the race would play out. Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said Mr. Biden should proceed.  #8220;I don #8217;t see why he should quit campaigning unless something really bad happens, #8221; Ms. Titus said.  #8220;And then all bets are off. #8221; What some Democrats feared, and Republicans hoped, is that there would be a rallying around Mr. Trump and he would garner sympathy from voters. Yet even the most optimistic Republican allowed that those sentiments wouldn #8217;t automatically translate into votes. At the very least, Republicans said they hoped Mr. Trump #8217;s illness would prompt him to refrain from the inflammatory rhetoric that has alienated many voters and make the election less of a referendum on his behavior."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TExt: (shortened for length): The first thing to say is simple: Best wishes to President Trump and the first lady for a speedy recovery from Covid-19. After the announcement that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, I tweeted that I hope we can all remain civil, avoid snark, seek lessons and wish the Trumps a swift recovery. The result was an outpouring of gloating and snark  #8212; one person responded that  #8220;my thoughts and prayers go out to the virus. #8221; Let #8217;s think about that. One of my objections to Trump has been the way he has eroded norms that underpin this country  #8212; like accepting election outcomes, respecting science and acting in a respectful way to opponents. If we decry such behavior and hope that the election can begin a period of national healing and recovery, then don #8217;t we uphold norms best by modeling them? A second point is also straightforward: Let #8217;s learn from the president #8217;s infection. Let #8217;s make this a wake-up call that leads to mask-wearing and social distancing, saving lives. The United States has lost 208,000 people to the pandemic in part because we as a country didn #8217;t take the virus seriously. We #8217;re seeing a rise in new infections, which now exceed 40,000 a day, roughly twice the level of early June, and many epidemiologists warn that it will most likely get worse. One reason for the uptick in numbers is increased testing, but another is simply that people in the United States and all over the world are suffering pandemic fatigue. We #8217;re sick of isolation. We crave human contact. We want hugs. We are social animals, and the virus exploits that instinct. I #8217;m now in Oregon, and I sense that we are all becoming more lax, particularly in parts of the country where the virus never hit hard and people didn #8217;t lose friends or see refrigerator trucks parked outside hospitals. That laxity is lethal. The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts that 363,000 Americans will have died of Covid-19 by Jan. 1. That would amount to more Americans dying in nine months from the virus than the total number of combat deaths over four years in World War II. Yet the institute #8217;s model also suggests that if 95 percent of Americans just wore masks (the level in Singapore), then nearly 100,000 lives could be saved between now and the end of the year. Think about that. As a country, we #8217;re still seared by the nearly 3,000 deaths in the 9/11 attacks. But the institute #8217;s model warns that by the end of December, we #8217;ll be losing that many each day. Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who early in his career helped eradicate smallpox, argues that we can crush this virus as well. We #8217;ve seen the toolbox that other countries employed to do so: universal mask use, social distancing, testing, contact tracing and so on. We as a country have the tools and we have the resources; what we lack is the will. Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas, suggested that he and other grandparents would prefer to die rather than take measures against the virus that would disrupt the economy. Uncovered protesters rampage through stores without masks, shouting  #8220;Take off your mask, #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s all a lie, #8221; and  #8220;Take it off. #8221; Store and restaurant employees have been shot by customers angered at requests that they wear masks. Mask-wearing lags in the United States compared with some other countries, particularly among men. A poll suggests that many American men see mask-wearing as wimpish,  #8220;a sign of weakness. #8221; Likewise, some Americans seem to believe that avoiding masks is a measure of freedom. No, it #8217;s a measure of decency, altruism and responsible behavior. But note that one should avoid masks with valves (which are less protective of other people) and use the mask to cover one #8217;s nose as well as one #8217;s mouth. And it #8217;s profoundly unhelpful to remove one #8217;s mask when speaking. Strangely, many of those who denounce masks are also those who claim to believe in  #8220;personal responsibility #8221; yet don #8217;t understand that going without a mask is just like driving while drunk. Sure, most of the time when you go without a mask, you won #8217;t infect anybody, just as most of the time if you drive while tipsy, you won #8217;t crash your car. Every day some 300,000 people drive while intoxicated, and they kill about 10,000 people a year  #8212; which pales beside the 100,000 who the modelers believe will die in the next three months because of reckless Americans who won #8217;t wear masks. Drunken driving, like mask avoidance, is largely male; three times as many men as women are arrested on charges of driving drunk. But we have been able to change norms and stigmatize drunken driving, while also nurturing new norms even about tasks that people find yucky, such as picking up dog poop. Perhaps the shock of Trump #8217;s infection gives the United States an opportunity to build a new national norm about wearing masks. It #8217;s extraordinary that mask-wearing is even controversial, considering that masks were used more than 100 years ago to mitigate the influenza pandemic of 1918 (although there was resistance then, too). A review of 172 studies in The Lancet found that face masks significantly reduce virus transmission, and one recent study estimated that state mask mandates (covering about half the American population) might have averted 230,000 coronavirus infections. In one study published this year, researchers placed hamsters with the coronavirus in cages next to those without the virus. When surgical masks were placed between the cages, infections fell by more than half. Asia #8217;s success in combating the virus  #8212; in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand  #8212; appears to be a result in part of people #8217;s willingness to wear masks. Crowded Hong Kong, for example, has a per capita death rate from Covid-19 only one-45th the rate of the United States, and Dr. Kwok-Yung Yuen, an infectious disease specialist there, told me the reason is straightforward: 97 percent of Hong Kong residents wear masks."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "With Election Day four weeks from Tuesday and millions already voting, former vice president Joe Biden is establishing a huge lead in national polling and solidifying his lead in must-win battleground states. By nearly every measure, President Trump #8217;s campaign is collapsing. The national polls are stunning: Biden has a 14-point lead in the NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll (53 percent to 39 percent) taken before Trump announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Biden has a 10-point led in the Reuters-Ipsos poll (51 percent to 41 percent). Biden led by at least eight points in all the polls released on Sunday. In the two most recent Pennsylvania polls, Biden leads by seven points. The FiveThirtyEight poll average shows Biden #8217;s lead hovering around seven points in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump #8217;s obnoxious and bullying routine in last week #8217;s debate did not sit well with viewers. NBC-WSJ polling found that 49 percent said Biden won, 24 percent said Trump won and 17 percent said neither did (the  #8220;balance #8221; punditry that both were bad gets the least support among actual voters). Trump #8217;s virus diagnosis, according to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, has confirmed voters #8217; negative view of his handling of the pandemic:  #8220;nearly 3 out of every 4 Americans doubt that he took seriously the threat posed to his well-being nor the steps necessary to avoid contracting the virus. #8221; Even more ominous for Trump, only 50 percent think he can  #8220;effectively handle his duties as president if there is a military or national security crisis. #8221; CNN #8217;s Jake Tapper spoke for many when he recounted Trump #8217;s disdain for the guidelines the rest of us follow: - CNN #8217;s @jaketapper:  #8220;Sick and in isolation, Mr. President, you have become a symbol of your own failures. Failures of recklessness, ignorance, arrogance. The same failures you have been inflicting on the rest of us ... Get well and get it together" #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/XXA5uC91Ea -  #8212; State of the Union (@CNNSotu) October 4, 2020  #8220;You are all now literally risking spreading the virus yourselves, #8221; Tapper pointed out Sunday as he displayed images of Republicans yukking it up without masks or social distancing at the White House event for Trump #8217;s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. It is not clear whether, or when, Trump will return to the campaign trail. For now he is limited to creating phony displays of his vigor (e.g., signing a blank piece of paper at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in an effort to seem busy) and making rambling videos. The White House makes all of this worse by giving false, conflicting and incomplete information about his health. Trump #8217;s campaign is sinking, but rather than swim to shore, Trump and his enablers seem intent on grabbing the nearest anvil. Campaign adviser Jason Miller went on the Sunday shows and continued to mock Biden for wearing a mask too frequently ( #8220;a prop, #8221; he called it), showing how little Trump has learned from his own illness. Trump is in the hospital; Biden is traveling to battleground states. Even worse, when confronted with the White House #8217;s failure to follow guidelines for mask-wearing, Miller insisted that all is well since they test for the virus. This mentality led to a Rose Garden event where attendees were tested, yet no fewer than eight people, that we know of, have tested positive for the virus. Is it possible these people still do not understand that you can test negative in the early stages of infection and still spread the contagion to others? No wonder their policies are so horribly misguided; they still do not grasp the most basic facts about the pandemic. Inarguably, Trump #8217;s worst problem is Trump. He reinforces the image of a reckless, incompetent, rude know-nothing. Voters have been telling him for months that they do not like his antics. Now, they are telling him he is worse than ever. In four weeks, they will deliver their official verdict."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: On Monday morning America #8217;s most prominent beneficiary of socialized medicine, in the process of receiving expensive, taxpayer-financed care at a government-run hospital, was tweeting furiously. One of President Trump #8217;s manic missives particularly caught the eyes of health care experts: his exhortation to  #8220;PROTECT PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. VOTE! #8221; As always, it #8217;s not clear whether Trump is merely being cynical or whether he is also genuinely ignorant. He #8217;s definitely lying when he claims to have a plan that #8217;s better and cheaper than Obamacare. No such plan exists, and he has to know that. But does he know that Americans with pre-existing medical conditions are already protected by the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn? Does he realize that the reason his party has never offered an acceptable alternative to the A.C.A., in particular an alternative that would protect pre-existing conditions, is that no such alternative is possible? That #8217;s less clear. In any case, how the nation votes will indeed make a huge difference to the future of health care  #8212; and not just because Trump, if he holds on to power, will almost surely find a way to destroy Obamacare, causing tens of millions of Americans to lose health insurance. Joe Biden, if he wins (and gets a Democratic Senate), will make a big difference in the other direction, substantially expanding coverage and reducing premiums for middle-class families. Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. The second part of this statement may come as news to many readers, because Biden #8217;s health proposals haven #8217;t drawn much attention so far. Why not? One reason is that the election is  #8212; rightly  #8212; being seen mainly as a referendum on Trump rather than on likely Democratic policy. Another is that since the Democratic primary fight pitted Biden against rivals calling for radical changes in health policy, many people assume that the winner of that fight, who rejected those radical proposals, wouldn #8217;t change much. But while Biden is indeed proposing incremental change rather than Medicare for All, we #8217;re talking about some big increments. Independent estimates suggest that under Biden #8217;s plan, 15 million to 20 million Americans would gain health insurance. And premiums would fall sharply, especially for middle-class families. What policy changes are we talking about? To the extent that the Biden plan has received any attention at all, this attention has largely been focused on his proposed introduction of a  #8220;public option #8221;  #8212; a Medicare-like plan that individuals could buy instead of purchasing private insurance. This option might be a first step toward a single-payer system, but it would be a small step, and in the near term would be much less important than other aspects of the plan. First and foremost, the Biden plan  #8212; Bidencare? ObamaBidencare?  #8212; would substantially increase the subsidies that currently help many but not all Americans who don #8217;t get insurance from their employers. The Affordable Care Act, as passed in 2010, was underfunded, because Democrats wanted to hold down the headline cost. This meant that premiums and co-payments were and are too high for many families. Since then, however, the politics have shifted: Public opinion has shifted in favor of the A.C.A., the Democratic Party has moved somewhat to the left and Republican willingness to ram through expensive, unfunded tax cuts has encouraged Democrats to be more aggressive. So the Biden plan would increase subsidies and also remove the upper-income limit that prevents many middle-class families from receiving aid. This would cost a fair amount of money: The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the price tag at $850 billion over a decade. But it would cost far less than the 2017 tax cut, much of which went to corporations, which were supposed to respond by increasing investment, but didn #8217;t. The Biden plan would also automatically enroll low-income Americans in the public option, which is more important than it might sound. One of the defects of our system is that it #8217;s complex and confusing, and those who need help the most are often the least able to navigate their way to getting it. Ideally we #8217;d just move to a simpler system, but for now auto-enrollment would be an important palliative measure. Oh, and the plan would also provide significant aid for long-term care, rural health, and mental health. None of this amounts to revolutionary change  #8212; in contrast to Trump #8217;s efforts to kill Obamacare, which would drastically change American health care, for the worse. But Bidencare would still be, as Biden didn #8217;t quite say when President Barack Obama signed the A.C.A. into law, a pretty big deal. True, America would still fall somewhat short of achieving what every other advanced country has  #8212; universal health care. But we #8217;d get a lot closer, and many who currently have insurance coverage would see their costs fall and the quality of coverage improve. So health care, including to PROTECT PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, really does need your VOTE! If Trump wins, Americans will lose that protection and many will lose their health insurance or see their premiums soar; if Biden wins, Americans will keep that protection and many will gain insurance or see their premiums fall."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump, still contagious with covid-19, seems intent not only to convey a dangerous message about the pandemic but also to demonstrate his utter disregard for the lives of those around him. He has taken a spin in a sealed vehicle with Secret Service agents, ripped off his mask upon returning to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and has refused to fess up about when he last tested negative for the coronavirus. If he does not care about the health of the people who drive his car, clean his home and work in his West Wing, you can be sure he does not care about the lives of the hundreds of millions of Americans living under his administration. Is it too far-fetched to think Trump did not have negative tests to ensure others #8217; safety before the Rose Garden event on Sept. 26 or the debate on Sept. 29? Before the latest example of his stomach-turning indifference to others, we would have doubted even he was capable of such conduct. Now, it would not be surprising to learn that he knowingly endangered others, especially because he is concealing tests he took prior to discovering the illness of White House staffer Hope Hicks and because he conveniently missed his test at the debate site in Cleveland. The failure to conduct contact tracing for those who attended the Rose Garden ceremony also raises suspicions that the White House wants to keep the extent of its covid-19 catastrophe under wraps. Republicans on the Hill are no better. They seem intent on jamming through a Supreme Court nominee who would likely strike down the Affordable Care Act. Even those who recently tested positive declare their intent to push forward with hearings next week. Some, such as Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), refuse to be tested at all. In conducting themselves with Trumpian disregard for others #8217; well-being, Republicans show the voters that they are just as indifferent to the harm they may cause others as Trump is. One wonders how a sitting judge such as Amy Coney Barrett could countenance this conduct designed to race against the election clock. The irony (or karma) is that this cavalier attitude toward a deadly disease is overwhelmingly unpopular. The poll numbers are staggeringly bad for Trump. In the most recent CNN poll, he trails former vice president Joe Biden by 16 points. It #8217;s not just Trump #8217;s collapse but a rise in Biden #8217;s popularity that is widening the gap. (CNN reports:  #8220;Biden #8217;s favorability ratings have also improved, with 52% of Americans now saying they have a positive impression of the former vice president, compared with 39% who have a positive view of Trump. #8221;) Biden #8217;s average lead, according to FiveThirtyEight, is nearly nine points. State polling is equally grim for Trump. In Pennsylvania, the most recent Monmouth poll puts Biden #8217;s lead at 12 points, up from a four-point lead just a month ago. Biden leads in Michigan by nearly nine points in the WDIV/Detroit News poll, with a roughly 30-point advantage among older voters. Trump #8217;s bullying behavior at the debate and his contemptuous and reckless response to covid-19 are sealing his fate. Should these numbers hold, we would be looking at a blowout election of the sort we have not seen in decades. Few Republicans outside deep-red enclaves are now secure. If the top of the ticket is running as strongly as Biden appears to be, down-ballot Republicans in states not normally at risk could be swept away. Why, then, do Republicans actually imitate Trump #8217;s behavior and defend his antics? You have got me, but they are destroying their own hopes for political survival. Do not be surprised if Senate seats in unlikely states (e.g., Alaska, South Carolina) fall into Democrats #8217; laps. If there is a blue tsunami, Republicans will have no one to blame but Trump and their own irresponsible mimicry of an utterly unfit president."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length, missing graphs): "You don #8217;t often see the number 57 percent in national, late-presidential-election polling. Maybe when measuring support among some demographic group, but not overall. The last time a presidential candidate received at least 57 percent of the actual vote was in 1984, when Ronald Reagan #8217;s reelection bid earned him more than 500 electoral votes. Things like that don #8217;t really happen anymore. And yet here was CNN and its polling partners at SSRS, releasing a poll Tuesday morning showing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leading President Trump by 16 points, with Biden earning the support of 57 percent of respondents. Now, in hyper-polarized 2020, CNN #8217;s poll has Biden getting nearly 6-in-10 votes nationally. To call this surprising is an understatement. It didn #8217;t take long for people to dump some cold water on enthusiastic Biden supporters. In mid-October 2016, after all, CBS News released a poll showing Hillary Clinton leading Trump by 14 points  #8212; and we know how that turned out. The central lesson from 2016 for many observers was that things can change dramatically and rapidly, and nothing should be taken for granted. Which is true, in the broadest sense of that advice. But it is also important to recognize that the 2020 race has not generally mirrored the race in 2016. It #8217;s important to recognize that Trump is now in a much worse position than he was four years ago, parallels aside. The story of the 2016 race was wild swings in support. That Clinton led Trump was consistent, but the margin of that lead varied widely. In the last 150 days of the contest, the range of margins between Clinton and Trump spread across more than 10 percentage points. It was a sine curve, with Clinton seeing wider and narrower leads over the course of the year. The race ended with a narrower lead  #8212; narrow enough that Trump wrung an electoral college victory out of the contest. By contrast, the 2020 race has been remarkably stable. Biden #8217;s lead has never been less than six points or more than 10 points. It #8217;s just a steady lead, as unaffected by the wild events of the year as the Rock of Gibraltar is obviously unaffected by a storm in the Mediterranean. The stability of the margins in the 2020 race have been remarkable even in the context of the last five elections. In 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, there was at some point a tie in the polling average in the last 150 days of the race. Not this year. This year, there hasn #8217;t even been a moment in which Biden #8217;s lead was as narrow as five points. Margins can be deceptive. That CBS News poll showing Clinton with a 14-point lead isn #8217;t really comparable with the new CNN poll in part because her support in it was only 52 percent. The issue for Trump wasn #8217;t that Clinton was outpacing him, it was that only 38 percent of voters planned to support him in that moment. Clinton had a big lead, but relatively modest support. Biden #8217;s 57 percent support is much more robust. While CNN #8217;s poll is currently an outlier (though, of course, that could change), the gap between Biden #8217;s support and Trump #8217;s is consistent with past polls from this cycle. If we look at the average levels of support for the candidates in FiveThirtyEight #8217;s data, we see a massive gap between Trump and Biden in 2020. Normally, the range of support seen by the candidates has some overlap, meaning that one candidate #8217;s highest level of support is higher than the other candidate #8217;s lowest level of support. In 2020, that hasn #8217;t been the case. In FiveThirtyEight #8217;s average, Biden #8217;s never been below 49.5 percent support in the last 150 days of the race and Trump #8217;s never been above 43.6  #8212; a nearly six-point gap. So what happened in 2016? Well, for one thing, there were more solid third-party candidates. For another, there was a much bigger pool of undecided voters. The two races in which we #8217;ve seen recent popular vote-electoral vote splits were in 2000 and 2016, years with stronger third-party candidates and more undecided voters late in the election. In 2020, that #8217;s not the case. Measuring the level of third-party support or undecided voters in the FiveThirtyEight average, we see that about 6 to 7 percent of voters fall into one of those categories. Most voters have made up their minds  #8212; as would make sense, given how polarized views of Trump are  #8212; and there #8217;s not much of an untapped pool of voters for either campaign to tap into. Trump trails in FiveThirtyEight #8217;s average by more than eight points right now and only a bit more than 6 percent of the electorate is undecided or leaning third-party. That #8217;s a problem for the incumbent. Another problem is that the undecided voters are probably less likely to give him the benefit of the doubt than they were four years ago. One metric I #8217;ve looked at frequently is how voters who dislike both candidates plan to vote. In 2016, Trump won that group on Election Day by 17 points. That was enough to make the difference in the three states that gave him his electoral college lead. This year, though, Biden #8217;s consistently led Trump among voters who view both him and Trump unfavorably  #8212; and led him by more than 20 points. Here, too, though, there #8217;s a difference from 2016: Biden #8217;s favorability with voters is substantially better than was Clinton #8217;s four years ago. That captures one part of a bigger story of how 2016 and 2020 differ: that there have been remarkable swings in how demographic groups view Trump. For example, voters age 65 and older have preferred the Republican to the Democrat in each of the past four presidential elections. It #8217;s a group that votes heavily and made up an important part of Trump #8217;s 2016 support. Polling this year (including from The Washington Post and our partners at ABC News) show Biden with an advantage among older voters. He led by five points in our recent poll, which had Biden up 10 points overall. In CNN #8217;s new poll, Biden leads among older voters by 21 points."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "Joe Biden has vowed to be a president for all Americans, even those who do not support him. In previous elections, such a promise might have sounded trite or treacly. Today, the idea that the president should have the entire nation #8217;s interests at heart feels almost revolutionary. Mr. Biden has also vowed to  #8220;restore the soul of America. #8221; It is a painful reminder that the country is weaker, angrier, less hopeful and more divided than it was four years ago. With this promise, Mr. Biden is assuring the public that he recognizes the magnitude of what the next president is being called upon to do. Thankfully, he is well suited to the challenge  #8212; perhaps particularly so. Kathleen Kingsbury, acting editorial page editor, wrote about the choice to endorse Joe Biden for president in a special edition of our Opinion Today newsletter. You can read it here. In the midst of unrelenting chaos, Mr. Biden is offering an anxious, exhausted nation something beyond policy or ideology. His campaign is rooted in steadiness, experience, compassion and decency. A President Biden would embrace the rule of law and restore public confidence in democratic institutions. He would return a respect for science and expertise to the government. He would stock his administration with competent, qualified, principled individuals. He would stand with America #8217;s allies and against adversaries that seek to undermine our democracy. He would work to address systemic injustices. He would not court foreign autocrats or give comfort to white supremacists. His focus would be on healing divisions and rallying the nation around shared values. He would understand that his first duty, always, is to the American people. But Mr. Biden is more than simply a steady hand on the wheel. His message of unity and pragmatism resonated with Democratic voters, who turned out in large numbers to elevate him above a sprawling primary field. His team has put together a bold agenda aimed at tackling some of America #8217;s most pressing problems. The former vice president is committed to working toward universal health care through measures such as adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act  #8212; which he played a significant role in passing  #8212; lowering the age for Medicare eligibility to 60 years old and cutting the cost of prescription drugs. He recognizes the fateful threat of climate change and has put forward an ambitious, $2 trillion plan to slash carbon emissions, invest in a green economy and combat environmental racism. Mr. Biden will not be morphing into an ideological maximalist any time soon, but he has acknowledged that the current trifecta of crises  #8212; a lethal pandemic, an economic meltdown and racial unrest  #8212; calls for an expanded governing vision. His campaign has been reaching out to a wide range of thinkers, including former rivals, to help craft more dynamic solutions. In midsummer, he rolled out an economic recovery plan, dubbed  #8220;Build Back Better, #8221; with proposals to bolster American manufacturing, spur innovation, build a  #8220;clean-energy economy, #8221; advance racial equity and support caregivers and educators. His plan for fighting the coronavirus includes the creation of a public health jobs corps. Progressives who want even more from him should not be afraid to push. Experience is not the same as stagnation. Mr. Biden has a long and distinguished record of accomplishment, including, as a senator, co-sponsoring the landmark Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and, as vice president, overseeing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, passed in response to the Great Recession. In a 2012 interview on  #8220;Meet the Press, #8221; his remarks in support of gay marriage  #8212; which blindsided the Obama White House and caused a public kerfuffle  #8212; proved a watershed moment for the cause of equality. In 1996, Mr. Biden had voted as a senator in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited federal recognition of same-sex marriages, making his evolution on the issue particularly resonant. He has an unusually rich grasp of and experience in foreign policy, which, as traditionally understood, has not played a central role in the presidential race  #8212; though the pandemic, the climate crisis, a more assertive China and disinformation wars against the American public argue strongly that it should. The next president will face the task of repairing the enormous damage inflicted on America #8217;s global reputation. Mr. Biden has the necessary chops, having spent much of his career focused on global concerns. He not only took on thorny diplomatic missions as vice president, he also served more than three decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Aware that an  #8220;America First #8221; approach in reality amounts to  #8220;America alone, #8221; he would work to revive and refurbish damaged alliances. He has the respect and trust of America #8217;s allies and would not be played for a fool by its adversaries. Certainly, not all of Mr. Biden #8217;s foreign policy decisions through the decades look sage in hindsight, but he has shown foresight in key moments. He fought a rear-guard action in the Obama White House to limit the futile surge in Afghanistan. He was against the 2011 intervention in Libya and skeptical of committing American troops to Syria. He opposed renewing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2007 and 2008 because it gave the government too much power to spy on Americans. He #8217;s supported closing the prison at Guant #225;namo Bay. Little wonder that he has the backing of a who #8217;s who of the foreign policy community and national security officials from both parties. Mr. Biden is not an ideological purist or a bomb-thrower. Some will see this as a shortcoming or hopelessly na #239;ve. Certainly, it #8217;s unlikely that if Republicans retain control of the Senate, their leader, Mitch McConnell, will abandon his policy of fanatical obstructionism of any Democratic president."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): Watching Kamala Harris take the stage tonight for her debate with Mike Pence, many Democrats may be wondering the same thing: Why would she agree to appear in person, just a few feet away from the vice president, amid a coronavirus outbreak that has ravaged the White House and infected President Donald Trump? The answer, above all, is that the Biden campaign does not want to shift the public #8217;s focus away from Trump #8217;s unsteady handling of the COVID-19 crisis #8212;not even to a debate about whether to debate. In that way, the campaign #8217;s decision for Harris to participate reflects the same messaging discipline that #8217;s led Joe Biden to brush off questions about, say, whether he supports packing the Supreme Court: He doesn #8217;t want to provide any opportunity for the GOP to talk about anything but Trump #8217;s performance. Multiple sources inside the Biden campaign told me officials never seriously explored withdrawing from tonight #8217;s debate or demanding that the Commission on Presidential Debates stage a virtual contest instead. Nor is the campaign, at this point, pushing either of those options ahead of the second Trump-Biden face-off next week.  #8220;Our point in this campaign is not about Donald Trump #8217;s personal health; it #8217;s about how he has handled the pandemic that #8217;s killed 200,000 people, #8221; said one Biden-campaign senior adviser, who, like others I talked with, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the team #8217;s internal deliberations.  #8220;We #8217;re not going to let this become a debate on what #8217;s going to happen on the 15th. #8221; Yet even with the Biden campaign #8217;s clear preference for in-person debating, there are no guarantees beyond tonight #8217;s session. Biden acknowledged yesterday that he will debate next week only if Trump is no longer contagious with the coronavirus. And in an interview last night, Frank J. Fahrenkopf, a co-chair of the debate commission, said the debate will happen as planned only if the Cleveland Clinic, the commission #8217;s health adviser, certifies that it #8217;s safe.  #8220;What we #8217;re going to do is say to the Cleveland Clinic,  #8216;Is it safe to do it? #8217; #8221; Fahrenkopf told me from Salt Lake City, the site of tonight #8217;s debate.  #8220;If they say  #8216;yes, #8217; we can do it. If they say  #8216;no, #8217; we have to make some other plans. #8221; Even the surge of cases at the White House this week did not cause serious second thoughts within the Biden campaign about Harris participating tonight, officials said.  #8220;Everybody was operating under the idea that debates happen in person, debates should be happening, #8221; another top campaign official told me.  #8220;I think we were always, and have been, operating under the instruction that it would go forward pending the advice of health experts and the commission itself. #8221; Pence threw a last-minute curveball into the plans when he balked at a key element of the commission #8217;s safety precautions. The commission and the Cleveland Clinic had originally intended to install plexiglass shields adjacent to both Pence and Harris, because a single divider between them would have interfered with the television shots, said Fahrenkopf, who served as the chair of the Republican National Committee during the 1980s. However, Pence #8217;s team pushed back on that idea earlier this week: Although they didn #8217;t object to Harris appearing beside a shield, they saw no need for such a barrier next to the vice president. But plans changed again at yesterday #8217;s walk-through: Pence #8217;s team agreed he would accept a shield if doing so would make Harris feel safer; when her campaign indicated that it would, Pence #8217;s team dropped its objection, Fahrenkopf told me.  #8220;It will be there, #8221; he said. Both the commission and the Cleveland Clinic are facing substantial skepticism from Democrats after the first debate between Trump and Biden, last week. Many Democrats were frustrated and angry that the two institutions did not enforce their own safety rules, and allowed Trump #8217;s entourage to sit in the hall without masks. Frustration turned into serious worry when Trump announced he had tested positive for the virus two days after the debate. With the White House refusing to reveal when he received his last negative test, many observers have questioned whether he might have been contagious while onstage with Biden, even though Trump #8217;s team certified to the Cleveland Clinic that he had tested negative before the encounter. (One source familiar with the discussions said that, contrary to popular belief, the candidates were not required to be tested on-site; instead, they were mandated to tell the Cleveland Clinic that they had tested negative within 72 hours of the debate.) Fahrenkopf acknowledged that the commission had mishandled the Trump retinue #8217;s flouting of mask rules.  #8220;Maybe we didn #8217;t do the job we should have, #8221; he told me.  #8220;I was astounded when they all took their masks off. #8221; At tonight #8217;s debate,  #8220;when I come out of the stage 15 minutes before [the start], we will serve notice that if you take the mask off, you will be removed, #8221; he said. However, there #8217;s a significant exception to that rule:  #8220;I can #8217;t do anything about the people inside the Secret Service #8221; protection, Fahrenkopf said. (He deferred questions about changing the testing regime for the candidates to the Cleveland Clinic, which did not respond to a request for comment.) Between the Trump team #8217;s disregard of safety rules at the first debate and the steadily rising caseload in the West Wing, Democrats in private conversations have raised two reasons Harris and Biden might refuse further in-person debates. One is that since he contracted the disease, Trump has been so reckless #8212;leaving Walter Reed to greet his supporters outside, removing his mask upon his return to the White House #8212;that the Biden campaign cannot take the risk of assuming that the president will follow whatever safety protocols the Cleveland Clinic and the debate commission establish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Any sliver of hope to avoid a Republican wipeout slipped away from President Trump on Thursday morning thanks to his refusal to attend the next presidential debate in a virtual format (necessitated by his covid-19 diagnosis), his hysterical demand that Hillary Clinton be indicted and his decision to throw insults at Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala D. Harris (he called her a  #8220;monster, #8221;  #8220;totally unlikable #8221; and a  #8220;communist"). It is noteworthy that one of Trump #8217;s objections to a virtual debate is that the moderator can cut you off. In other words, deprived of the chance to bully and interrupt, Trump is pitifully weak. Trump #8217;s latest crazy-talk should suffice to convince all but his sycophantic enablers that he is entirely unable to perform the duties of his office. The difference between the two campaigns  #8212; one calm and winning, the other unhinged and losing  #8212; is evident. The Post reports: -  #8220;I #8217;m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That #8217;s not what debating is all about, #8221; [Trump] said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on the Fox Business Network. - Shortly afterward, Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said Biden welcomes the chance to participate in a virtual debate. -  #8220;Vice President Biden looks forward to speaking directly to the American people and comparing his plan for bringing the country together and building back better with Donald Trump #8217;s failed leadership on the coronavirus that has thrown the strong economy he inherited into the worst downturn since the Great Depression, #8221; she said in a statement. - Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien blasted the commission #8217;s decision in a statement, saying Trump would  #8220;do a rally instead #8221; of accepting what he characterized as a  #8220;pathetic #8221; decision. Stepien has tested positive for the coronavirus, so perhaps he is a poor spokesman for the position that the campaign intends to disregard health guidelines and put even more Americans at risk. Joe Biden wisely told reporters that he did not know if Trump would stick to his position.  #8220;We don #8217;t know what the president #8217;s gonna do; he changes his mind every second, #8221; Biden said. If Trump does not show, it is unclear whether the debate commission would afford Biden the stage to answer audience questions. If not, certainly one of the news networks would be happy to host another Biden town hall, a format that he recently demonstrated works well for him. The reckless disregard for others #8217; well-being and the gross insults at the only African American woman ever to be on a major presidential ticket will only heighten Trump #8217;s problem with women. It is noteworthy that the most memorable line of the VP debate may have been  #8220;Mr. Vice President, I #8217;m speaking. #8221; There is not a woman in America who has not been talked over, interrupted or put down by a male peer. The all-male Republican ticket remains oblivious. In 26 days, voting will end. (Remember millions of votes are being cast as Trump slogs through the worst days of his presidency.) While Biden #8217;s victory seems extremely likely, many questions remain: - Will Trump #8217;s horrid poll numbers and especially appalling conduct in recent days depress the Republican vote, serving as a self-fulfilling prophesy of a blowout? - Will Biden score wins deep into Republican territory where polls show him highly competitive (e.g., South Carolina, Georgia, Ohio and Texas)? If so, will this serve as a major realignment of the parties and the collapse of the Republican Party as we know it? - How many Senate seats will Republicans lose? One can imagine that Democrats will lose Alabama but enjoy a double-digit pickup. The list of states in play for Democrats is long: Maine, Colorado, North Carolina and Arizona look like easy wins. Iowa, South Carolina, Montana, Alaska, two Georgia Senate seats and even Texas are competitive. - How many Republicans will openly and dramatically break with Trump, going so far as to condemn his reckless behavior and racist rhetoric? - Can Biden rack up enough clear wins early on election night to dissuade Republican efforts to disrupt or discredit the results? Barring an unforeseen calamity, we are witnessing the end of our national nightmare. The end cannot come soon enough  #8212; especially for those Trump still might infect and endanger."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "The first presidential debate  #8212; just over a week ago, if calculated in ordinary time  #8212; was a nightmare. Moderator Chris Wallace failed to keep President Trump under control, and the dominant memory is of three White men in their 70s shouting over one another. The one and only vice-presidential debate Wednesday night was a different kind of mess, but no more useful to the voting public. USA Today #8217;s Susan Page asked some excellent questions, but the candidates dodged them, giving mini-speeches about the subjects of their choice instead. Page failed to effectively follow up by demanding germane answers; nor did she successfully enforce time limits  #8212; meaning that the dominant memory of that night is of a fly lingering on Mike Pence #8217;s white hair or Kamala Harris #8217;s pained smiling (following the ironclad women #8217;s rule for expressing disagreement) as she repeated the phrase,  #8220;I #8217;m speaking. #8221; Harris wouldn #8217;t answer a reasonable question about whether a Biden administration would seek to add seats to the Supreme Court. Pence wouldn #8217;t address the even more consequential issue of what he would do if Trump refused to leave office, as he #8217;s suggested he might if he doesn #8217;t like the results of next month #8217;s election. (And after he failed to speak up for a peaceful transfer of power, noted Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Page #8217;s only follow-up  #8220;was to ask a kid #8217;s question about why people in politics don #8217;t get along. #8221;) With these dispiriting events still fresh in one #8217;s mind, a sensation of welcome relief flooded in when the presidential debate commission announced Thursday morning that, given Trump #8217;s recent covid-19 diagnosis and general public health concerns, the second Trump-Biden debate would not be done in person next week but rather remotely. The decision made good sense. Chris Wallace tried  #8212; and failed  #8212; to control Trump. Something needs to change. For safety #8217;s sake, the candidates should not be on a stage together, with or without those unimpressive plexiglass dividers. Even if masked and socially distant, debate staff and audience members would be in harm #8217;s way. The remote setup would also offer the possibility of cutting off either speaker if he spoke out of turn, interrupted or got abusive. (One of the few blessings of this dreadful era, in which a mismanaged pandemic has already taken 210,000 American lives, is the  #8220;mute #8221; function on Zoom.) But no sooner did that sane announcement come than Trump did what we might all have predicted. He picked up his marbles  #8212; what #8217;s left of them  #8212; and went home.  #8220;I #8217;m not going to do a virtual debate. . #8201;. #8201;. I #8217;m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate, #8221; he told Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network in a phone interview.  #8220;That #8217;s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate. It #8217;s ridiculous. #8221; Getting to the heart of his problem, he added in a disparaging tone:  #8220;And then they cut you off whenever they want. #8221; If the next debate were canceled entirely, it would be a shame, in some ways. It #8217;s slated to be hosted by Steve Scully, the political editor of C-SPAN, in a  #8220;town hall #8221; format where prospective voters would ask the questions  #8212; something that occasionally engenders more thoughtful and less combative answers. And generally, debates can serve an important purpose: They allow citizens to get a look at how the candidates behave under stress. At their best, these sessions can give a glimpse of a candidate #8217;s character, nimbleness, intelligence, preparedness  #8212; especially for those viewers who haven #8217;t been following the campaigns closely. They sometimes even produce memorable or entertaining moments that don #8217;t involve flying insects. Given Trump #8217;s history, of course, his fit of pique Thursday morning could just be another reality-TV moment of demanding the spotlight be on him and only him. It #8217;s likely  #8212; maybe inevitable  #8212; that there will be more exciting developments yet to come. In fact, by mid-afternoon Thursday, the Trump and Biden campaigns were discussing how to salvage the town-hall debate by delaying the date. It #8217;s, well, debatable if any of the planned events will come off. But if it doesn #8217;t, that #8217;s perfectly fine. We #8217;ve seen enough."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Last year Donald Trump called Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, a  #8220;nasty, vindictive, horrible person. #8221; Actually, she isn #8217;t  #8212; but he is. Trump #8217;s vindictiveness has become a major worry as the election approaches. He has already signaled that he won #8217;t accept the result if he loses, which seems increasingly likely though not certain. Nobody knows what chaos, possibly including violence, he may unleash if the election doesn #8217;t go his way. Even aside from that concern, however, a defeated Trump would still be president for two and a half months. Would he spend that time acting destructively, in effect taking revenge on America for rejecting him? Well, we got a preview of what a lame-duck Trump presidency might look like Tuesday. Trump hasn #8217;t even lost yet, but he abruptly cut off talks on an economic relief package millions of Americans desperately need (although as of Thursday he seemed to be backtracking). And his motivation seems to have been sheer spite. Why do we need economic relief? Despite several months of large employment gains, America has only partly recovered from horrific job losses in the early months of the pandemic  #8212; and the pace of recovery has slowed to a relative crawl. All indications are that the economy will remain weak for many months, maybe even years. Paul Krugman #8217;s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy  #8212; and an even deeper look at what #8217;s on Paul #8217;s mind. Given this grim reality, the federal government should still be providing the kind of relief it offered in the first few months of the crisis: generous aid to the unemployed and loans that help keep small businesses afloat. Otherwise we #8217;ll soon be seeing millions of families unable to pay their rent, hundreds of thousands of businesses going under. In addition, state and local governments  #8212; which, unlike the federal government, are generally required to balance their budgets  #8212; are in desperate fiscal straits, because the pandemic slump has drastically reduced their revenues. They need a lot of aid, soon, or they will be forced into deep cuts in employment and services. We #8217;ve already lost around 900,000 jobs in state and local education. So there #8217;s an overwhelming humanitarian case for major spending on relief: Unless the federal government steps in, there will be huge unnecessary suffering. There #8217;s also a macroeconomic case: If families are forced to slash consumption, if businesses are forced to close and if state and local governments are forced into extreme spending cuts, the economy #8217;s growth will slow and we might even slide back into recession. I know, I know, the usual suspects will say that the calls for economic relief are just more big-government liberalism. But warnings about the dangers of failing to provide more relief aren #8217;t just coming from progressive Democrats; they #8217;re coming from Wall Street analysts and Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Yet negotiations over relief have been stalled for months, even as special aid to the unemployed and small businesses has expired. The main stumbling block, I #8217;d argue, has been the adamant refusal of Senate Republicans to consider aid to state and local governments; Democrats would probably have agreed to a deal that included significant aid, even though it would have helped Trump politically. But Republicans have insisted  #8212; falsely  #8212; that this is all about rescuing badly run blue states. And Trump echoed that falsehood as he pulled the plug on Tuesday, claiming that Pelosi #8217;s proposals are nothing but a bailout of  #8220;high crime, poorly run, Democrat States. #8221; (Not that facts matter, but Democratic states actually have lower crime rates, on average, than Republican states.) The question is, why did Trump choose to reject even the possibility of a deal less than a month before Election Day? True, it #8217;s too late for legislation to make much difference to the state of the economy on Nov. 3, although a deal might have averted some corporate layoffs. But it would surely be in Trump #8217;s political interest to at least look as if he #8217;s trying to help Americans in distress. Why would Trump choose this, of all moments, to torpedo economic policy? As far as I can tell, nobody has offered a plausible political motive, any way in which refusing even to try rescuing the economy helps Trump #8217;s prospects. What this looks like, instead, is vindictiveness. I don #8217;t know whether Trump expects to lose the election. But he #8217;s already acting like a deeply embittered man, lashing out at people he feels have treated him unfairly, which is basically everyone. And as usual he reserves special rage for smart, tough women; on Thursday he called Kamala Harris a  #8220;monster. #8221; Yet getting a relief deal would have required accepting a compromise with that  #8220;nasty #8221; woman Nancy Pelosi. And it seems that he would rather let the economy burn. The thing is, if he #8217;s behaving like this now, when he still has some chance of winning, how will he act if he loses? The most immediate concern is that he won #8217;t accept the election results. But we should also be worried about what will follow if he is forced to accept the will of the people, but is still running the country. Trump has always been vindictive; what will he do if and when he has nothing left but spite?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Predictions are risky these days, but I make this one confidently: President Trump's frantic desperation at the prospect of losing the election will only get worse. Probably much worse. I know that seems impossible, given the volume of vitriol now spewing hourly from the president. And I know it makes no political sense for Trump to continue to sound like a deranged end-of-days preacher yelling at random passersby. But nothing in Trump's history suggests he will abandon his reelection "strategy" of unceasing bombast, transparent lies, manufactured grievance, unhinged conspiracy-mongering and an unforgivable attempt to disrupt the electoral process itself. Another day, another flood of dangerous and offensive nonsense: In a single telephone interview Thursday with Fox Business Network, Trump vowed not to attend a virtual debate next week with his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, complaining that the moderator would actually be able to cut him off; called Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a "monster" and a "communist," among other insults; and described himself as a "perfect physical specimen," saying he believed he had been "cured" of covid-19, a disease for which there is no known cure. Trump also attacked two of his most loyal and obedient Cabinet members, Attorney General William P. Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for not helping his political prospects by fabricating a criminal investigation of Biden and Hillary Clinton. Yes, he is still ranting about her emails. Trump has two good reasons to panic. Foremost are the recent polls showing that his political support is clearly eroding. The RealClearPolitics poll average now shows him trailing Biden by 9.7 points nationally, which would be a landslide. Even Rasmussen Reports, usually Trump's most favorable pollster, released a survey this week showing Biden ahead by 12 points. Polls of likely voters in the battleground states also show that his prospects range, from Trump's point of view, between dismal and catastrophic. The other calamity Trump faces is his own covid-19 diagnosis, one of dozens of cases in a growing cluster centered on the White House. Trump wants voters to believe his administration has done an outstanding job in handling the pandemic, despite the fact that the United States has suffered far more infections and deaths per capita than other wealthy countries. But it is hard to argue that covid-19 is under control when the most powerful, most heavily protected man in the nation became a victim of the pandemic and had to be flown by helicopter to the hospital. Trump could have used his own illness to express empathy for the millions of other Americans who have been infected with the novel coronavirus  #8212; and sympathy for the 212,000 who have died. Instead, he tried to project defiance and strength. His made-for-television return to the White House on Monday  #8212; when he took off his mask and posed like an old-school Latin American strongman on the South Portico, visibly out of breath  #8212; had to be one of the weirdest moments in the history of the presidency. Any other politician might step back and take a wider view. If Trump's covid-19 diagnosis caused his poll numbers to swoon, they might recover somewhat as his condition  #8212; one hopes  #8212; improves. If voters disapproved of his obnoxiousness during last week's debate against Biden, he could try a different approach next time. But Trump either hates to change course or doesn't know how. From every indication, he intends to plow straight ahead  #8212; never mind the cliff he is rapidly approaching. The Republican senators Trump is dragging down with him have not yet cut him loose in an attempt to save themselves. But there are rustlings. If and when these endangered incumbents begin to assert their independence, you will know that Trump's collapse in the polls is real. Still, however, it would not be time to breathe a sigh of relief. Not quite yet. The fact that he's openly attacking Barr, Pompeo and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray tells me that he doesn't really expect them to concoct a bogus investigation of Biden before the election. But Barr, especially, appears more than willing to help in Trump's attempt to delegitimize any voting process that produces a Biden victory. The most important thing we can do is vote. Republicans can make it inconvenient for voters to cast their ballots, but they can't make it impossible. Vote early by mail and track your ballot online. Vote early in person, wearing a mask and taking all precautions. Have a plan for Election Day, and follow through. Be patient, be determined, don't give up. And as for Trump, let him howl at the moon all he wants. He's scared. And he has good reason to be."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened for length): "With little more than three weeks remaining until Election Day, President Trump is in a race against the clock as he continues to trail former vice president Joe Biden by double digits, his standing driven down by distrust on the issue of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. The president has not managed to close the gap with Biden during a tumultuous period of events that included the first presidential debate, the debate between Vice President Pence and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Trump #8217;s hospitalization after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. In fact, the race has changed little over a period of months, with voters seemingly impervious to the flood of news and controversies. Biden is favored by 54 percent of likely voters, with Trump favored by 42 percent. Libertarian Party nominee Jo Jorgensen receives 2 percent support, and Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins is at 1 percent. Biden #8217;s lead among registered voters is also 12 points, consistent with Post-ABC polls taken in recent months. Q: If the presidential election were being held today and the candidates were Donald Trump and Mike Pence, the Republicans and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the Democrats, for whom would you vote? Would you lean toward Trump and Pence or Biden and Harris? (Among registered voters) National polls reflect the status of the popular vote and not the state-by-state contests for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Post-ABC polls of battleground states, as well as other public polls, show Biden with an advantage in that competition as well, though the state margins generally are narrower, and some states are considered toss-ups. Still, no candidate has won an electoral-college majority while losing the popular vote by a margin like Trump #8217;s current deficit. The major obstacles in the president #8217;s path remain his overall approval rating and how Americans judge his handling of the pandemic. Despite his efforts, he has not been able to change those assessments, and until he does, he will struggle to overtake his Democratic challenger. Trump #8217;s overall approval rating among registered voters stands at 45 percent positive and 54 percent negative, with 47 percent saying they strongly disapprove. Among those who approve of his job performance, 90 percent favor him for reelection, while among those who disapprove, 93 percent favor Biden. Notably, Trump #8217;s deficit in support to Biden has hovered close to his net approval margin throughout the election. The president #8217;s ratings on handling the pandemic are slightly worse than his overall marks, with 41 percent of registered voters saying they approve and 58 percent saying they disapprove. Slightly more than 9 in 10 who approve of his handling of the outbreak support Trump for reelection, while nearly 9 in 10 who disapprove support Biden. Trump maintains positive ratings for handling economy, but receives lower marks for handling coronavirus outbreak and his overall performance Trump #8217;s best ratings come on the economy, where 54 percent of voters approve of his performance and 45 percent disapprove. However, on this measure, there is less symmetry in how this translates into support for him and Biden. Among those who approve of his handling of the economy, 77 percent back the president, and 16 percent favor Biden. Among those who disapprove of his handling of the economy, 96 percent support Biden for president compared with 0 percent for Trump, with the remainder supporting Jorgensen, Hawkins or offering no preference. The reason for this appears to be voters #8217; judgment that the president #8217;s pandemic response matters more to them than his handling of the economy as they determine whom to support. Among the 12 percent of the electorate that approves of Trump on the economy but disapproves of the way he has handled the pandemic, 58 percent support Biden, while 19 percent back the president. About 4 in 10 registered voters approve of Trump on both the economy and the pandemic, and more than 9 in 10 of those voters back him for reelection. Just over 4 in 10 disapprove of his handling of both, and more than 9 in 10 of them say they support Biden. Trump is judged harshly both for his handling of the pandemic and for failing to take what people regard as adequate protections to avoid contracting the virus. Almost 2 in 3 voters say Trump did not take appropriate precautions to reduce the chances of catching the coronavirus, and 6 in 10 say they do not trust the administration to provide complete and accurate information about his health. White House officials have repeatedly refused, for example, to say when the president last tested negative, a key judgment in ascertaining whether he remains contagious as he returns to campaigning. Just over 6 in 10 say they do not trust what he says about the pandemic, including 48 percent who say they trust him  #8220;not at all #8221; in his pronouncements. The poll finds that about 6 in 10 voters say they believe Trump is healthy enough to carry out his duties as president. The president has said he feels good and, after holding an event at the White House on Saturday, he plans to travel to Florida on Monday for a rally. Still, given Trump #8217;s illness and an increase in coronavirus cases in many states, the pandemic continues to cast a shadow over the election. Nearly 8 in 10 registered voters say the virus is somewhat under control or not at all under control, although the percentage who say it is not at all under control has dropped from 49 percent in August to 35 percent this month. Nearly 2 in 3 say they are  #8220;very #8221; or  #8220;somewhat #8221; worried that they or a family member might catch the virus, and 8 percent say an immediate family member has been infected."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On national polls, her biggest lead was about seven points in October. But there are differences. There were more undecided voters before the election then, and they broke for Trump big-time. Now, Trump is well-known as a president, and his record (esp. with COVID) is a real problem. Biden is also polling over 50% favorability which Hillary never did. Biden is +7, while Trump is -11.

    <TEXT>TEXT: "NBC News reports,  #8220;Vulnerable GOP candidates are currently tethered to an unpopular president, fighting for survival against a potential blue wave after Trump #8217;s widely panned performance in the first debate, his coronavirus diagnosis and his erratic behavior on economic stimulus talks. #8221; Some Republican strategists  #8212; likely the same ones who counseled not to show any daylight between down-ticket Republicans and President Trump  #8212; now suggest  #8220;shifting resources #8221; to Senate Republicans. That #8217;s too little, too late  #8212; and beside the point. Republicans, by their own admission, are being swamped in the money race. Democrats #8217; sky-high enthusiasm translates into record-setting fundraising totals for their Senate candidates. In South Carolina, Democratic candidate Jaime Harrison, who is challenging Republican Sen. Lindsey O. Graham,  #8220;started out the year by posting impressive fundraising totals each quarter  #8212; $7.37 million and $14 million, respectively  #8212; and outraising Graham each quarter too, #8221; Cook Political Report finds.  #8220;Democrats expect a historic third-quarter fundraising haul from Harrison too, who #8217;s been raising money at a fast clip ($10.6 million in August alone) even before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg #8217;s death last month where ActBlue donations poured into campaigns across the board. #8221; Graham has taken to pleading on Fox News for more money, but money isn #8217;t his problem and, in any event, Harrison has more of it. Likewise in Iowa, where Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield brought in a stunning $28.7 million in the third quarter alone in her race against Republican Sen. Joni Ernst. Democrats enjoy similar money advantages in Senate races in Colorado and North Carolina. In short, even if there are funds to shift to struggling Republicans, from all appearances it seems Democrats will simply raise more. The big problem is that Senate Republicans wrapped themselves so tightly around Trump  #8212; defending his plainly impeachable conduct in the Senate trial, excusing his covid-denialism, ignoring his racist language and incitement to violence and declining to stop his financial self-dealing  #8212; that it #8217;s too late to scurry away from the sinking Trump ship. When the GOP eschewed a convention platform this summer in favor of heaping praise on Trump, Republicans made clear that they have no position other than Trump idolatry. Even now, they seem not to have learned anything. Graham recklessly refuses to take a coronavirus test and pushes ahead with Amy Coney Barrett #8217;s confirmation as his opponent makes hay of Graham #8217;s opposition to the Affordable Care Act. As Cook Political Report notes, Harrison ads feature women slamming Graham  #8212; who is struggling to gain women #8217;s support  #8212; on health care and saying that  #8220;Harrison #8217;s  #8216;values #8217; now more closely reflect their values. Harrison has made this race about character and in other Democratic ads they turn the tables and paint Graham as part of the  #8216;swamp, #8217; and that seems to be working. #8221; Graham makes the mistake of thinking that confirming a staunchly conservative justice will help him; in fact, it underscores his disconnect from voters he once carried easily. The crazier Trump seems in the last stretch (pleading for indictments of his political opponents, recklessly spreading covid-19, on-again-off-again stimulus negotiations), the more pathetic the Republicans who enabled him look. This is the guy you said had it all figured out? This was the guy you defended as a victim of liberal elites? These Republicans long ago threw away independent judgment, character, responsiveness to the voters back home and honesty, for fear of provoking Trump #8217;s ire or the condemnation of the right-wing media and the MAGA crowd. It turns out winning is awfully hard, even in red states, when your Trump sycophancy horrifies women, college-educated voters, non-White voters, young voters and seniors. Money is the least of Republicans #8217; troubles."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Given the precarious state of the economy, President Trump #8217;s reckless decision to walk away from stimulus negotiations last week was a consequential act of political malpractice. He has since flipped and flopped on this by the hour, but his actions have been particularly rash given his administration #8217;s failure to even try to control the virus. First they ignored the health outcomes. Now they #8217;re playing erratic politics with the resulting economic pain. But working Americans face yet another, less widely noticed Trump-induced economic problem: the historically large and worsening U.S. trade deficit and the drag it is creating on the economy. The failure to offset this drag with fiscal stimulus is already being felt in communities across the land. Trump clearly ran on the trade deficit as a scorecard, claiming that his trade policies would  #8220;speedily reduce the deficit, #8221; which would drop like  #8220;you #8217;ve never seen before. #8221; He complained about decades of trade deals by  #8220;stupid #8221; negotiators that allowed other countries to rip off America. Once in office, he waged a retaliatory trade war. His weapon of choice was a broad set of tariffs on many of our trading partners, from Canada to China. Well, the data are in, and Trump #8217;s war is lost. The trade deficit in August was $67 billion, its highest level since August 2006. For manufactured goods, the deficit was $84 billion, the biggest on record with data starting in 1992 (the deficit is also up slightly as a share of GDP). In fact, Trump #8217;s loss of the trade war was inevitable. Although he and his aides never seemed to understand this basic fact, the tariffs were mostly paid for not by foreign companies exporting to the United States, but by American consumers and producers. An early hint that something was fundamentally wrong with Trump #8217;s theory of the case was when Alcoa, America #8217;s largest aluminum producer, asked for an exemption from Trump #8217;s aluminum tariff  #8212; which had been intended to protect it from foreign competition. (The reason it needed the exemption is that Alcoa imports Canadian materials as inputs to its production.) Thanks in part to the trade war, American manufacturing was in a recession before the pandemic. Instead, the determinants of our persistent trade deficits stem from at least three sources: other countries #8217; persistent trade surpluses (which often result from their managing foreign exchange to make their exports cheaper in dollars and our exports more expensive in their home currencies), U.S. companies taking advantage of low-cost labor to outsource jobs and undermine the bargaining power of U.S. workers, and the reluctance of U.S. policymakers to take the necessary steps to push back on these actions. Because global trade must balance, trade surpluses in one country must be offset by deficits elsewhere. In the name of unfettered globalization that was sold as a boon to everyone, trade surplus countries with abundant low-wage workers, such as China, linked up with major American retailers to set up low-cost supply chains throughout the developing world. At the same time, American offshorers increasingly set up shop abroad, motivated by both cheap foreign labor and a tax system that rewards offshore production. Not only did the Trump administration do nothing to push back on these factors driving the trade deficit; it made matters worse. According to Public Citizen,  #8220;At least $425.6 billion in U.S. tax dollars has gone to firms that have been certified by the U.S. government as having offshored [over 200,000] jobs during the Trump administration. #8221; The administration opposed any efforts to boost working bargaining power that could have helped counteract the trade-induced downward pressure on wages, and its 2017 tax plan sharply increased the incentives to offshore production. To be clear, there have been many periods when other growth factors in the U.S. economy more than offset the drag from trade deficits. Unfortunately, now is not one of those times. Unless policymakers act quickly, there will be no countervailing sources of demand to reverse the impact of Trump #8217;s historically large trade imbalances. The first step is a robust stimulus package to provide much-needed economic relief to the tens of millions of Americans still suffering economic hardship, while also helping to offset the drag from the trade deficit. At the same time, other recovering economies must stimulate their economies or the U.S. trade deficit will likely worsen as we once again become the driver of global consumption. If Trump had not thoroughly alienated our allies over the last four years, this is precisely the sort of coordinated policy he could have negotiated when the pandemic hit. The next steps are to take the offshoring incentives out of the tax code, strengthen American unions, onshore vital supply chains, stand up a strong Buy American policy for government procurement, and enact strong domestic public investment in areas like clean energy to create good, green jobs while making a serious play for global market share in the production of renewable energy. Those are all key components of the Biden agenda (disclosure: Bernstein is an informal adviser to the Biden campaign), none of which are supported by Trump or the Republicans. (A potential exception might be Trump #8217;s on-again, off-again support for a stimulus bill, but the blockage here may prove to be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his GOP caucus, rather than the White House.) The bad news is that U.S. economy is currently under threat from Trump #8217;s triple-play failure: the total absence of presidential leadership on virus control and stimulus, and a trade war that has demonstrably backfired. The good news is that we have an imminent choice to pursue a very different path on all of the above."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: Paul Krugman I keep seeing news reports saying that the Trump administration is  #8220;pivoting #8221; on economic stimulus. But Donald Trump has been reversing positions so frequently that it looks less like a series of pivots than like a tailspin. Over the course of just a week he went from demanding big stimulus, to calling off negotiations, to demanding big stimulus again, to calling for a small-scale deal using already allocated funds. It would be funny if the human consequences weren #8217;t so terrible. At this point the best guess is that for the next three-plus months  #8212; that is, until President Joe Biden takes office (highly likely, though not certain) with a Democratic Senate (more likely than not, but definitely not a sure thing)  #8212; there will be little or no aid for the millions of families, thousands of businesses and many state and local governments on the brink of disaster. But why isn #8217;t America getting the pandemic relief it so obviously needs? It #8217;s easy to blame Trump, who has managed to spend four years in office without learning anything about policy and has surrounded himself with officials chosen for slavish personal loyalty rather than expertise. As a recent article in Politico put it:  #8220;Never mind the A Team. At this point, even the B Team would represent a significant upgrade. #8221; But even if Trump had any idea what he was doing, he would be paralyzed by the opposition of many, probably most Senate Republicans to any serious deal. They #8217;re willing to cover for Trump #8217;s unprecedented corruption; they #8217;re apparently unbothered by his fondness for foreign dictators. But spending money to help Americans in distress? That #8217;s where they draw the line. This was obvious even before the coronavirus struck. Remember how Trump promised to spend trillions on infrastructure, then defaulted on that promise?  #8220;Infrastructure week #8221; eventually became a running joke. But while Trump #8217;s infrastructure proposals never made any sense, in early 2019 it seemed as if he might actually have a deal with Democrats for a serious spending plan. But the deal went nowhere thanks to opposition from Senate Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. McConnell and company are also the main reason we don #8217;t have a deal to help Americans survive the economic effects of the pandemic. We should have had a deal in the summer, when it was already obvious that the rescue package approved in March was going to expire much too soon. But Senate Republicans were adamantly opposed to providing the necessary aid. Lindsey Graham declared that emergency unemployment benefits would be extended  #8220;over our dead bodies #8221; (actually 215,000 other people #8217;s dead bodies, but who #8217;s counting?). And McConnell  #8212; whose state benefits from far more federal spending than it pays in taxes  #8212; derided proposed aid to states as a  #8220;blue state bailout. #8221; The thing is, Trump #8217;s chances of re-election and McConnell #8217;s chances of holding on to the Senate would almost surely be better if there actually had been an infrastructure bill last year and a relief bill this past summer. Why weren #8217;t Republicans willing to make those deals? Whatever they may say, they weren #8217;t concerned about the cost. Republicans didn #8217;t worry about budget deficits when they rammed through a $2 trillion tax cut for corporations and the wealthy. They only pose as deficit hawks when trying to block spending that might help ordinary Americans. No, what this is really about is the modern G.O.P. #8217;s plutocratic agenda. McConnell and, as far as I can tell, every member of his caucus are completely committed to cutting taxes on the rich and aid to the poor and middle class. Other than March #8217;s CARES Act, which Republicans passed only because they were panicking over a plunging stock market, it #8217;s hard to think of any major G.O.P.-approved fiscal legislation in the past two decades that didn #8217;t redistribute income upward. You might think that Republicans would set the plutocratic imperative aside when the case for more government spending is compelling, whether it #8217;s to repair our crumbling infrastructure or to provide relief during a pandemic. But all indications are that they believe  #8212; probably rightly  #8212; that successful government programs make the public more receptive to proposals for additional programs. That #8217;s why the G.O.P. has tried so frantically to overturn the Affordable Care Act; at this point it #8217;s clear that Obamacare #8217;s success in cutting the number of uninsured Americans has created an appetite for further health care reform. And that #8217;s why Republicans are unwilling to provide desperately needed aid to economic victims of the pandemic. They aren #8217;t worried that a relief package would fail; they #8217;re worried that it might succeed, showing that sometimes more government spending is a good thing. Indeed, a successful relief package might pave the way for Democratic proposals that would, among other things, drastically reduce child poverty. So while Trump bears much of the responsibility for the misery facing millions of Americans, McConnell probably bears an equal share. Will they pay the political price? We #8217;ll find out in three weeks."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "We #8217;ve finally learned what President Trump means by  #8220;Obamagate. #8221; Except it #8217;s nothing President Barack Obama did  #8212; it #8217;s what Trump is doing right now. While Trump falsely accuses Obama of having abused government power to skew an election four years ago, that #8217;s exactly what Trump himself is doing now. Trailing badly in the polls, Trump is pressuring more aggressively and more explicitly his attorney general, secretary of state and other Cabinet members to abuse executive branch authority to boost his electoral chances. Call it  #8220;Trumpgate #8221;  #8212; but unlike Obamagate, it #8217;s all too real. Ultimately, it #8217;s a race by Trump to abuse governmental authority quickly enough to entrench his power before voters can take it away from him. Trump has never really explained what he means by Obamagate, but that hasn #8217;t stopped him from railing against it. In Trump #8217;s cryptic words:  #8220;Obamagate. It #8217;s been going on for a long time. It #8217;s been going on from before I even got elected. And it #8217;s a disgrace that it happened. #8221; Whatever Obamagate is supposed to be mean, this much seems clear: It stands for Trump #8217;s claim that Obama and his administration somehow tried to abuse presidential authority to skew the 2016 election to hurt Trump and help Hillary Clinton. To make that claim, Trump and his supporters have taken a few baseless allegations against Obama  #8212; that he had Trump #8217;s  #8220;wires tapped, #8221;  #8220;spied on #8221; his campaign, worked  #8220;to entrap #8221; Trump campaign officials and so on  #8212; and labeled it all Obamagate. Trump #8217;s grievances against Obama have been thoroughly debunked. But at last, we actually know what Trump has had in mind all along  #8212; because he #8217;s now engaging in the very abuse of presidential power to skew an election of which he has long accused Obama. Start with the Justice Department. Trump has relied on Attorney General William P. Barr to turn what should be the federal government #8217;s least political department into its most viciously political one. That began with Barr #8217;s introduction of a different brand of justice for such Trump associates as Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser whose charges Barr abruptly ordered dropped, and Roger Stone, the Trump confidant whose sentencing recommendation Barr demanded to be reduced. But now Trump #8217;s politicization of the Justice Department has become pointed specifically toward supporting his reelection. Desperate to bolster Trump #8217;s discredited claims that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, the department recently issued a bizarre news release announcing a mere investigation into nine discarded mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania, and even more bizarrely specifying that they #8217;d mostly been marked with votes for Trump. And Trump #8217;s big hope for an October surprise had been Barr #8217;s politically driven pet project: the John Durham-led investigation into the origins of the 2016 Russia investigation. In recent days, Trump has gone so far as to state publicly that he #8217;ll be disappointed if that effort fails to indict Democrats like Obama and even Trump #8217;s challenger, former vice president Joe Biden. It #8217;s hard to imagine a more blatant abuse of executive authority than to demand criminal charges against a political opponent ahead of Election Day  #8212; and indeed, that #8217;s precisely the type of election-skewing abuse of power of which Trump has long accused Obama, except now it #8217;s real. But Trump hasn #8217;t stopped at the Justice Department, especially with reports that the Durham investigation won #8217;t yield new charges before Nov. 3. He #8217;s now set his sights on the State Department, too, where a pliant Secretary Mike Pompeo yielded to Trump #8217;s public criticism by announcing an upcoming release of additional Clinton emails. Just as Trump couldn #8217;t have been clearer about why he #8217;s upset with Pompeo  #8212; asked about the Clinton emails not yet released by the secretary of state, Trump replied,  #8220;I #8217;m not happy about him for that reason #8221;  #8212; Pompeo couldn #8217;t have been clearer about why, all of a sudden, he #8217;s pledging a rushed release of emails that the State Department hasn #8217;t deemed fit to release despite years of consideration:  #8220;I certainly think there #8217;ll be more to see before the election, #8221; Pompeo promised. At the State Department, just as at the Justice Department, Trump has engineered an active, open, explicit push to wield the powers of the executive branch to skew the presidential election. Trump has found a way to do in 2020 the very thing he #8217;s long been telling a story about Obama doing in 2016. Trump hasn #8217;t limited his abuse of authority for electoral benefit to those departments, either. At the Department of Homeland Security, Trump #8217;s acting secretary, Chad Wolf, has relentlessly overstated and mischaracterized the nature of protests in Portland to justify deploying federal law enforcement and thus boost Trump #8217;s campaign narrative of a widespread violence that he hopes will yield large voter turnout from his supporters. As former Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway captured Trump #8217;s campaign strategy:  #8220;The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who #8217;s best on public safety and law and order. #8221; DHS has, at Trump #8217;s direction, helped Trump to conjure that sense of chaos and violence. At the Defense Department, both the defense secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff indulged Trump #8217;s horrifying use of tear gas and rubber bullets against peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square to facilitate Trump #8217;s photo opportunity in front of a church across the park from the White House. The list goes on. So, finally, we know what Trump had in mind with the term  #8220;Obamagate #8221;: the anti-democratic use of governmental authority to skew America #8217;s democratic elections. It #8217;s something any normal administration  #8212; Obama #8217;s or any other  #8212; would abhor. But it #8217;s Trump #8217;s last gasp at winning reelection. And if the polls are right, it won #8217;t work  #8212; and we #8217;ll have taken the critical first step to restoring the democratic norms Trump has worked so relentlessly to batter."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) showed some candor for once. Instead of denying that he wanted to use the Supreme Court to achieve what President Trump and Republicans could not  #8212; repealing the Affordable Care Act  #8212; he started out Tuesday #8217;s hearing on Judge Amy Coney Barrett #8217;s confirmation with a confession, of sorts.  #8220;All of my colleagues on the other side had emotional pleas about Obamacare, #8221; Graham said.  #8220;Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina. All of you over there want to impose Obamacare on South Carolina. We don #8217;t want it. We want something better. #8221; The American people have plainly said otherwise, having flipped the House in 2018 to Democratic control, largely on the issue of health care. We are also in the middle of an election, during which voters can once again make their voices heard. But Graham and his colleagues, surely sensing a massive defeat ahead, figure Barrett will be the ticket to dismantling the popular health-care statute. Clarity is refreshing. Republicans fawning over a professional woman with seven children (no attention was paid to the late Justice Antonin Scalia #8217;s large family) reveals their cluelessness about the lives of working American mothers. Millions of women are juggling work, family and, now, home education, thanks to covid-19. Barrett is not exceptional in that regard; she is among the most privileged. If only Republicans had such concern for working mothers on issues such as child care. As Trump #8217;s prospects look bleaker by the day (he trails by more than 10 points in FiveThirtyEight #8217;s average, and credible pollsters give former vice president Joe Biden more than the required 270 electoral votes) and Senate Republicans look headed for the minority, Republicans now take to railing against majority rule. The party that used to see the Supreme Court as interlopers into the political process now looks to  #8220;originalists #8221; to create a pathway to right-wing outcomes. Does anyone really think that Barrett #8217;s criticism of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. #8217;s opinion on the ACA does not reveal her hostility to the law  #8212; especially when she falsely declares that protections for preexisting conditions are not part of the current case seeking to strike down the entire law? And are we to believe, as she claimed, that she has yet to make up her mind on abortion access, even though she signed a petition decrying the practice? If viewers want real insight into Barrett #8217;s views, consider her declaration that she shares the judicial philosophy of Scalia  #8212; an unpopular ideology that would prevent the federal government from providing health care (but permit a federal definition of marriage?), read the Second Amendment in sweeping terms and give Congress little leeway under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to  #8220;enforce, by appropriate legislation #8221; equal protection of the law (thereby dooming the central feature of the Voting Rights Act). It is fortunate that we can see how closely Republicans #8217; purported judicial philosophy tracks its agenda. The public is telling us they want a vigorous federal government to address a once-in-a-generation health and economic crisis, racial injustice and global warming. The only way Republicans are going to keep those popular demands from becoming policy (e.g., invalidating carbon emission standards, watering down the Voting Rights Act) is by finding eager allies on the federal bench. In a sense, voters now get perfect clarity: Republicans want no significant change in the racial and gender status quo, a hogtied federal government and broad exemptions for those flashing the  #8220;religious liberty #8221; card to shield them from perceived threats to their image of a White, Christian America. That #8217;s the world they are desperately trying to fortify with a Supreme Court entirely out of step with the times. They might win the battle for Barrett, but there is no winning the war against majority rule. The larger Republicans #8217; defeat in November, the harder it will be to maintain their backward-looking conception of America."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "As you #8217;ve heard, Wolf Blitzer and Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had a very contentious exchange on Tuesday, in which the CNN anchor demanded to know why the House Speaker was not prepared to support the White House #8217;s offer of a $1.8 trillion stimulus package.  #8220;Don #8217;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, #8221; Blitzer told Pelosi, thus seeming to suggest that the real holdup to any deal is Democratic opposition. But new reporting from Bloomberg News strongly suggests another angle worth investigating, if the goal is to truly get to the bottom of what might end up holding up an agreement. And this angle points to an even bigger story: how Republicans may already be laying the groundwork to try to destroy a Joe Biden presidency, should he win the election. The short version: A Senate GOP strategist privately confided to Bloomberg that a key Republican goal right now is to lay the groundwork to revert hard to austerity, should Biden prevail, crippling the possibility of any serious stimulus efforts next year, even amid continued economic misery. As of now, Senate Republicans are hostile to supporting a deal even if the White House and House Democrats can reach one. The White House #8217;s $1.8 trillion offer includes some things Democrats want, such as $1,200 checks to individuals, but Pelosi wants more money for aid to states and a national strategy against the novel coronavirus, among other things. Senate Republicans may not even accept spending levels that the White House is proposing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is planning a vote on a far smaller package  #8212; $500 billion for extended assistance for the unemployed and small businesses, among other things. The Senate bill appears designed to do the minimum while giving vulnerable GOP senators a way to say they #8217;re doing something at a moment of deep economic peril, in hopes of salvaging McConnell #8217;s majority. But Trump undermined that strategy by tweeting:  #8220;Go big or go home! #8221; Now Senate Republicans risk getting split between the conservative impulse to spend as little as possible (at least on aid to distressed Americans) and Trump #8217;s demand (for now, anyway) for more spending. But, given that spending more now would likely boost Trump #8217;s reelection chances, why aren #8217;t Senate Republicans on board? The Bloomberg report offers this remarkable clue: A GOP strategist who has been consulting with Senate campaigns said Republicans have been carefully laying the groundwork to restrain a Biden administration on federal spending and the budget deficit by talking up concerns about the price tag for another round of virus relief. The thinking, the strategist said, is that it would be very hard politically to agree on spending trillions more now and then in January suddenly embrace fiscal restraint. This is an anonymous source. But it accords with what all our intuitions and our understanding of recent U.S. political history tell us. Republicans almost certainly suspect Trump will lose even with a big stimulus and already hope to put an incoming President Joe Biden in a fiscal straitjacket, saddling him with the terrible politics of a grueling recovery. A big package now under a GOP president would make that harder to get away with. That #8217;s bad enough, but the evolving strategy here may be worse than this suggests. The calculation is probably not just about avoiding the hypocrisy of spending big now and embracing austerity under a Democratic president. It #8217;s also likely that a big package now would put the economy in a somewhat better position early next year, when Biden (should he win) would take over. This, too, is probably what Republicans want to avoid. Indeed, as Eric Levitz points out, if Republicans can scuttle a robust package now, that would hand Biden a  #8220;deepening recession. #8221; If Republicans hold the Senate and can block big stimulus measures at that point, Levitz continues,  #8220;Biden #8217;s presidency would be over before it starts. #8221; And so, when McConnell chortled with glee at this week #8217;s debate in Kentucky about the failure to pass more aid at a desperate national moment, it telegraphed what #8217;s coming. And we #8217;ve already lived through what happened when Republicans, led by McConnell, tried to cripple the recovery from a previous economic calamity that a Democratic president inherited from a Republican one. Back then, McConnell calculated that if Republicans adopted a strategy of openly tailoring everything around the overarching goal of denying Barack Obama bipartisan support, Obama would take the blame for it. It #8217;s likely McConnell is already thinking the same. Obviously Republicans might theoretically oppose more spending to address a recession during a Biden presidency out of adherence to principle, however egregiously misguided. But notably, the GOP strategist above also telegraphs a strategy of constraining Biden by suddenly claiming to care deeply about deficits. That #8217;s particularly galling, given that Trump and the GOP passed a massive corporate tax giveaway that lavished enormous benefits on top earners while helping to explode the deficit. Now concern over that deficit will be used to try to cripple a Biden presidency through austerity. Which leads to a final point. As I #8217;ve noted, Trump campaigned in 2016 on a (fraudulent) promise to break with orthodox conservative economics, including opposition to big expenditures in the public interest, vowing to preserve safety nets and invest in job-creating infrastructure. In many ways Trump tossed that vow aside and embraced GOP plutocracy. But now he #8217;s suddenly desperate to secure another huge spending infusion, because he needs one to salvage his reelection hopes. So it would constitute a perverse form of poetic justice if a GOP refusal to go along  #8212; one rooted in a strategy of hamstringing a Democratic president from addressing deep national challenges  #8212; ends up contributing in some small way to Trump #8217;s political demise."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (shortened for length) "President Trump has long seemed fascinated with the idea that herd immunity could provide an easy end to the coronavirus pandemic, even before his own diagnosis with covid-19 and his blithe declaration after he checked himself out of the hospital that no one should be afraid of getting it.  #8220;With time, it goes away, #8221; he told an ABC News town hall last month.  #8220;And you #8217;ll develop  #8212; you #8217;ll develop herd  #8212; like a herd mentality. It #8217;s going to be  #8212; it #8217;s going to be herd-developed, and that #8217;s going to happen. That will all happen. #8221; The neuroradiologist he brought in to advise on the pandemic response over the summer, Scott Atlas, has argued that rising case counts will bring the nation to herd immunity faster. Now the White House says has turned this half-baked idea into an official strategy, calling it  #8220;focused protection. #8221; In this approach, the virus would be allowed to spread among young, healthy people with little attempt to slow it down, while officials try to keep older, more vulnerable Americans from contracting it. In the modern era, herd immunity is best achieved by vaccination, when enough people acquire immunity to an infection through a shot in the arm to protect the whole community. That #8217;s our goal every flu season; it #8217;s the reason we vaccinate infants against dreaded childhood diseases. But now, the official policy of the Trump administration will be to try to speed up the arrival of herd immunity to the novel coronavirus by letting the virus infect people faster. Without a vaccine, though, this strategy risks the deaths of millions of Americans. Proponents of herd immunity with  #8220;focused protection #8221; generally oppose mask mandates, contact tracing and other measures to slow the spread of the virus because they imagine that infection can be confined to the  #8220;low risk #8221; population and want to hasten infection in that group. After falsely promising that the epidemic would go away  #8220;like a miracle #8221; when the weather turned warm, the White House has now found support for its new cold-weather line of wishful thinking in the so-called  #8220;Great Barrington Declaration, #8221; a document published last week at a ceremony at a libertarian think tank by three scientists whose views diverge sharply from those of most infectious-disease epidemiologists[ML1]. On Tuesday night, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity told reporters that the plan  #8220;is endorsing what the president #8217;s strategy has been for months. #8221; Supporters of this view are half right: We must indeed do all in our power to protect the vulnerable. More resources are desperately needed to keep nursing homes safe, including considerably increased testing capacity and personal protective equipment, better sick leave policies for their staff, and smarter ways to deploy staff so that those who may already be immune due to prior infection can interact with the highest-risk residents. More broadly, this pandemic disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities, so  #8220;the most vulnerable #8221; actually include the poor, essential workers and those who society already routinely fails to protect. As we and many others work hard to hone strategies to protect all these populations, the administration has failed to support, and often hampered, such efforts to shield those at highest risk. For example, Trump forced meatpacking plants to reopen in April without mandatory protections in place; these venues were deemed essential but were hot spots for transmission and disproportionately employ Latino and African American workers. Unfortunately, no one has so far devised an approach to protecting the vulnerable that really works, especially when the infection is raging in society at large. Surely we should do all we can to change that, and surely we all want to get back to our pre-covid-19 lives. Yet until we have a proven means to protect those most at risk and put those safeguards in place, letting up on control and plunging ahead in pursuit of herd immunity via massive infection rates amounts to unilateral disarmament. Scientists and clinicians in and out of government have been working hard to protect these groups, with little or modest success, for most of the year, while also attempting to minimize the threat that community transmission poses to them and to all of us  #8212; a belt-and-suspenders approach. Letting the virus tear out of control in the population at large before we really know how to protect the vulnerable is like ripping off our suspenders before we have the belt on. Just look at Sweden, the poster country for the  #8220;age-targeted #8221; approach: Even the architects of that strategy admit they failed their nursing homes. Even if we had more faith that we could protect those at greatest risk, though, there are still more fundamental reasons to resist the notion of dropping our guard. That strategy rests on the notion that the virus is harmless to most people and risky only for defined groups; that we will get to herd immunity sooner or later, so we may as well do it sooner; and that if we just tell people to go back to normal life, the world as we knew it in 2019 will return. These are all false hopes."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: (missing tables): "President Trump #8217;s campaign travel this week included two unexpected stops. On Wednesday, he flew to Iowa for a rally in Des Moines. On Friday, he has two rallies scheduled, including one in Georgia. These are states he won by nine points and five points respectively four years ago. If his campaign thinks they need to be shored up with less than three weeks to go until the election, well, that #8217;s not a great sign. But they do need to be shored up. In each of FiveThirtyEight #8217;s averages of polls from those states, former vice president Joe Biden has a narrow, one-point lead. That #8217;s the sort of margin that might allow Trump to wrest the states back into his win column, but if he #8217;s having to fight over states he won by nine points four years ago, it suggests a bleak result in the various states that he won by the skin of his teeth. In fact, as we reported last week, the state-level polling averages currently suggest that Trump will lose the election by a wide margin. Even if those polls are off by a decent-size margin, Trump still loses. If the polling average in each state holds as of writing and is as far from the mark as it was in 2016, Biden will flip five states (though not Georgia and Iowa) and win by 100 electoral votes. Again, a lot of the states are still close and can easily swing back to Trump. But a general shift in the president #8217;s favor probably necessitates an overall national shift  #8212; something that to this point simply hasn #8217;t been a feature of the 2020 race. Of the last 13 presidential contests (from 1968 to 2016), the candidate leading with 20 days to go won the popular vote on all but two occasions. One of those was 2000, when the final popular vote total swung to Democrat Al Gore  #8212; but not in enough places to earn him a victory in the electoral college. The other time was in 2012, when polls underestimated Barack Obama #8217;s national support. Image without a caption That analogy no doubt holds some appeal to Trump: an incumbent president who earned more support than expected in his first race and who trailed in his reelection bid. But with 20 days to go in 2008, Obama trailed by only 1.6 points, according to FiveThirtyEight #8217;s average, not the 10.5 points by which Trump currently trails. There have been big shifts in the final weeks of a campaign, but the biggest gap between the polling average 20 days out and the final result was that 5.5-point swing in 2012. Give Trump 5.5 points nationally and he #8217;s still trailing by only a little less than Jimmy Carter was at the same point in 1980. The Carter analogy no doubt does not hold appeal for Trump. There #8217;s another complicating factor with which Trump has to contend. According to data compiled by the University of Florida #8217;s Michael McDonald, more than 14.4 million ballots have already been cast this year. That #8217;s more than 10 percent of the ballots which were cast in 2016. At a similar point in 2016, 16 days from the election, the number of ballots cast early totaled less than 5 percent of the 2012 total. (In 2008 and 2012, the number of ballots tallied by McDonald made up about a quarter of the prior election #8217;s total.) Why does that matter? Because those votes are done, over, set in stone. If something massive happens now, some of those voters might be able to invalidate the votes they already cast, but it #8217;s not a simple proposition and not something that can be done in every state. So Trump #8217;s campaign can be confident that there are already 14 million-odd votes which have been submitted at a point where he trails nationally by about 10 points. Most of those votes are likely from Democrats, given the dynamics of voting by mail this year, but those are nonetheless votes that have been banked. Put this together and the picture for Trump is bleak. He trails by a wide margin nationally at a point when trailing by a wide margin generally reflects the actual result. He trails in key swing states and is close in states that he won easily four years ago. And millions of votes have already been submitted, making them largely immune to any last-minute shift in the contest. As always, we reiterate that Trump can certainly win the race. But a presidential contest in which the Republican incumbent is trying to make sure he can win the agricultural state of Iowa is not a contest in which things are going the way he would wish."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "President Trump is often at his most revealing when he #8217;s angry, and his appearance at the NBC town hall was notable for his repeated flashes of barely suppressed rage. And in this case, a common thread ran through those moments on Thursday night, one that captures an essential truth about how he has approached his entire reelection campaign. It #8217;s this: Trump is in a fury because he isn #8217;t being permitted to wage this campaign in his own manufactured universe, a universe that #8217;s almost entirely fictional. Trump just issued a barrage of tweets that spun new fictions about his performance: He claimed he has received  #8220;very good reviews #8221; and that his poll numbers are  #8220;very strong. #8221; In fact, Trump trails by double digits in national polls, and by anywhere from four to seven points in the five or six states that will decide the election. Paradoxically enough, Trump #8217;s anger at the town hall  #8212; whatever  #8220;reviews #8221; he received  #8212; neatly demonstrated why he #8217;s losing. Consider what, in particular, got him angriest: the exchanges over white supremacy and QAnon. Trump grew particularly incensed when moderator Savannah Guthrie pressed him on whether he #8217;d denounce white supremacy. He insisted this question is unfair, and said,  #8220;I denounce white supremacy, #8221; but then abruptly pivoted to denouncing  #8220;antifa #8221; and the  #8220;people on the left that are burning down our cities. #8221; The pivot itself is the thing. Trump is angry that the campaign isn #8217;t being waged in the universe he tried to manufacture for it, one in which the most serious threat to civil society right now is organized violent left-wing terrorism. Trump #8217;s alternate universe of leftist terrorism Trump has devoted extraordinary resources to the creation of this universe. Last spring his campaign dumped at least $20 million into ads depicting the terrifying police-free dystopia that Joe Biden would allegedly create. Many of his senior law enforcement and national security officials lent official credence to an absurdly exaggerated depiction of the leftist threat. The Biden response to this was to point out that Trump #8217;s  #8220;law and order #8221; rhetoric is a smokescreen for deliberately stoking white backlash while working to encourage and politically profit from violent civil strife. This was illustrated with ads suggesting that Trump encourages white supremacy and vigilante violence by his supporters. Of course, all of that is exactly what Trump has been doing, as senior adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed when she admitted to the calculation that violence helps him politically. Yet this wasn #8217;t supposed to be exposed. He was supposed to get away with stoking white backlash while making the debate all about exaggerated impressions of leftist violence. And so, when Trump rages about being pressed on his flirtation with white supremacy, and insists we should be talking about antifa instead, he #8217;s raging that he isn #8217;t being allowed to dictate this campaign #8217;s reality with impunity. Indeed, the new Department of Homeland Security threat assessment  #8212; an official government document, as opposed to public statements from political appointees  #8212; concludes that white supremacist extremists pose the deadliest domestic terror threat. The fact that Biden is winning the  #8220;law and order #8221; argument suggests reality is trumping the president #8216;s recasting of it. Trump winks at QAnon Trump tried the same pivot when Guthrie pressed him to disavow QAnon, the conspiracy theory movement holding that top Democrats belong to a shadowy cabal of pedophiles who are working to destroy Trump. First he claimed not to know what it stands for, then allowed that he agreed with its opposition to pedophilia. Then he said:  #8220;Why aren #8217;t you asking me about antifa? Why aren #8217;t you asking me about the radical left? #8221; Trump might as well have said: Why isn #8217;t this campaign unfolding in the fictional universe that I created for it? It #8217;s often noted that Trump is reluctant to criticize groups who support him, even ones with the most demented and extreme views, such as white supremacists or QAnon. But the deeper point here is that Trump wants to be permitted to maintain his under-the-radar bond with the extremist fringe while barring any tough questioning of himself over it and while inflating a comparatively minor threat on the left into the  #8220;real #8221; extremists. It #8217;s telling that Trump grows so angered at precisely the moments when this is not permitted. There may be only one answer On other fronts, we saw a similar dynamic. Trump falsely claimed that huge percentages of people who wear masks catch coronavirus, only the latest in a much broader effort to re-create political reality as a place where he has been right to scoff at social distancing all along. This recasting of reality is also failing: New polls show his approval on the pandemic is at abysmal lows, even as large majorities would support a national mask mandate. And even when Trump finally conceded he #8217;d accept a peaceful transfer of power, he quickly added the caveat that he would only do so if we have an  #8220;honest #8221; election, and again floated the usual false and unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud. When told that his FBI director says large-scale fraud isn #8217;t a threat, he angrily rejoined:  #8220;Then he #8217;s not doing a very good job. #8221; We all know what Trump means by all this, because he has repeatedly told us so himself: An  #8220;honest #8221; election can only be one in which he prevails. Here again Trump is asserting that he creates the reality within which this election is unfolding, and raging at outside voices that contradict it, even ones in his own government. In the end, there may be only one real rejoinder to all of this depravity. And it may be unfolding before our eyes right now: Americans are already voting in record numbers, and most of them are Democrats."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT (shortened): "The next attorney general of the United States faces two daunting decisions: whether to investigate possible criminal conduct by a former president and members of his administration, and if so, whether to file charges. The Justice Manual directs federal prosecutors to bring charges if they believe that an offense has been committed, if the admissible evidence is enough  #8220;to obtain and sustain a conviction, #8221; and if prosecution will serve a substantial federal interest. Donald Trump and his aides best serves justice, but public reporting suggests there is evidence that could support such charges. State prosecutors also may have evidence of illegal conduct. The statute of limitations for most federal offenses is five years. That means crimes that occurred as far back as 2016 could be charged until their anniversary date in 2021. Older offenses may also be charged if the conduct was part of an ongoing conspiracy  #8212; for instance, if a coverup continued within the five-year period covered by the statute. Trump has engaged in other deplorable conduct that probably does not amount to criminal activity. Hiding accurate information about the coronavirus epidemic, for example, may have contributed to the deaths of Americans, but the causal connection is probably too tenuous to charge him with crimes such as negligent homicide or manslaughter. Some say Trump #8217;s conduct toward Russia is treason  #8212; including his silence following reporting about Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan  #8212; but this is a nonstarter. Conduct cannot amount to treason unless a person provides aid and comfort to an enemy with whom our nation is engaged in armed conflict. Here are categories of possible crimes that prosecutors could consider  #8212; what the rap sheet of an ex-president might look like. Obstruction of justice The gist of this crime is impeding an investigation for a corrupt purpose. Special counsel Robert Mueller #8217;s investigation of possible links between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election developed evidence of 10 instances when Trump was involved in obstruction. In at least four of those instances, Mueller laid out evidence sufficient to prove each element of the offense: Trump #8217;s efforts to limit Mueller #8217;s investigation to future elections; to dissuade his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, from cooperating with prosecutors; to fire Mueller; and to cover up the attempt to fire Mueller. It is not necessary to show that any underlying crime was committed to establish obstruction of justice. Intentional interference in an investigator #8217;s work is crime enough. Although some critics dismiss obstruction of justice as  #8220;mere process crimes, #8221; prosecutors consider this a serious offense because it goes to the heart of the criminal justice system #8217;s truth-finding mission. False statements and perjury also fall within the obstruction family. During Mueller #8217;s investigation, Trump refused to submit to an in-person interview but agreed to answer written questions. A less-redacted version of Mueller #8217;s report released this summer revealed that the special counsel examined whether Trump lied in his written answers when he denied he had advance knowledge of the release of stolen emails by WikiLeaks, which is inconsistent with other evidence. Family members and associates of Trump are suspected of committing perjury, or lying under oath, at congressional hearings. Lawmakers have pointed to discrepancies between the testimony of certain witnesses and the testimony of Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Stephen Bannon and Erik Prince. Bribery Asking for a thing of value in exchange for the performance of an official act violates the federal bribery statute. When Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine in 2019, he was arguably doing just that. The evidence at his impeachment trial included Trump #8217;s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking for a  #8220;favor #8221; in the form of finding dirt on a political opponent, Joe Biden. A witness at the impeachment inquiry testified that announcing an investigation that could implicate Biden was a quid pro quo for receiving the military aid. Although the Senate acquitted Trump in his impeachment trial, the Fifth Amendment #8217;s double jeopardy clause should not bar criminal charges, because Trump did not face a loss of liberty over impeachment but rather loss of the presidency. Trump also uses his properties to generate revenue from parties doing business with the government, which could justify a bribery investigation. Recent reporting indicates that lobbyists and foreign government officials pay to get into the Trump International Hotel in Washington and the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to obtain access to Trump. If the president rewarded those spending money at his hotels and resorts with favorable official decisions in office, he could be criminally liable. Conspiracy to defraud the United States This occurs when individuals agree to obstruct the work of a federal agency. If membersof the Trump administration sabotaged the U.S. Postal Service to influence the outcome of the 2020 election, this charge could be considered for anyone who conspired to achieve the illegal objective, even those who took no personal action. This way, the law can reach people who give illegal orders as well as those who carry them out. Campaign finance violations In August 2018, Trump #8217;s former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making illegal contributions to Trump #8217;s presidential campaign to buy the silence of adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had had an affair with Trump. According to the government #8217;s sentencing memo, Cohen set up a shell corporation to make a $130,000 payment to prevent Daniels from making public statements that would harm Trump #8217;s candidacy. As stated in court documents in Cohen #8217;s case, the payments assisted the campaign by preventing the publication of negative stories about candidate Trump that might influence the election. His payment exceeded the legal limit of $2,700 for campaign contributions and violated the law prohibiting corporate contributions. The government stated that Cohen  #8220;acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1 #8221;  #8212; identified as someone who ran  #8220;an ultimately successful campaign for President of the United States. #8221; It appears that the Justice Department has already reached the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence to charge Trump."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "Assuming President Trump loses his reelection bid in a few weeks, the soon-to-be alumni of the Trump administration, who were warned that association with Trump would mar their careers and corrode their character, are now "hoping the Trump presidency isn #8217;t a disqualifying blemish on their resumes or Google footprint as the door revolves the other way and they seek to land, once again, in the private sector, #8221; The Post reports. They should think more about atoning for the betrayal of their country than trying to escape the consequences of enabling a liar, racist and wannabe authoritarian. There are practical reasons for employers outside the right-wing bubble to reject not only those who were the face of the administration but also those who labored behind the scenes. First, members of this administration probably acquired bad habits (ignoring gross misconduct, lying for their boss, etc.), practiced a great deal of willful ignorance and rationalized unethical conduct. The administration, aside from its corruption and moral rot, was also grossly incompetent in its day-to-day operations. Staffers coming out of Trump #8217;s orbit would likely have to unlearn misconceptions about how functional workplaces operate. Second, those seen as ethically obtuse and tolerant of racism pose a business risk. Clients and customers might not want to be associated with a firm that features someone who just months ago promoted their boss #8217;s ludicrous lies or remained silent as he winked at QAnon conspiracy theories. Alumni of the Trump administration do not suffer from a political association but rather from their willingness to enable someone who betrayed his country #8217;s highest ideals. How do conspiracy theories and racism move from the fringe to a political platform? The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has found the way. (Video: Parjanya Christian Holtz, Kate Woodsome/Photo: Markus Schreiber / AP/The Washington Post) In other words, these ex-Trump figures do not bring desirable skills or valuable experience; they come more as a potential liability. There is, as I have argued, a moral imperative to hold people accountable for their actions. Employees who obstructed justice, misrepresented facts to courts or lied to Congress must be held responsible under criminal statutes and professional rules of conduct. State bar authorities will need to step up to identify behavior, which, if allowed to go unpunished, would bring disrepute on the profession and set a bad example for others. If elected, former vice president Joe Biden will need to decide how to clean house, which might involve investigating and holding departed Trump officials responsible. We as a country and as individuals need to decide whether those who are unremorseful, who seek no forgiveness and who admit no complicity in an administration that engaged in reprehensible conduct deserve to be welcomed back into  #8220;polite #8221; society. It seems like another moral failing on the part of Trumpers that they whine about the stigma of their tenure without shouldering any responsibility to come clean and make amends. You would think that before seeking cushy jobs, these Trump alumni might seek to make up for perpetuating racism and xenophobia, for their attacks on democratic institutions and norms, and for their efforts to sow division and undermine objective reality. They might consider community service. They might donate time or money to groups fighting racism, helping immigrants, defending press freedoms and teaching good citizenship. No one forced anyone to work in this administration. No one forced them to stay to the bitter end or to conceal wrongdoing or to attack critics. These actions have consequences. Instead of whining about unfair treatment, it is time for Trumpers to do some self-reflection and figure out how to make up for the damage they have done. Then they might be fit to hire."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TEXT: "In public, President Trump and his campaign team project a sense of optimism and bravado. When they meet with Republican donors and state party leaders, presidential aides insist they are fully capable of achieving a close victory over Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Nov. 3. On television and in campaign appearances, Mr. Trump and his children dismiss public polls that suggest that his prospects are bleak. The president #8217;s calendar of events is packed through Election Day, with aides predicting a thrice-a-day rally schedule in the final weeks of the race. When Mr. Trump contemplates the prospect of defeat, he does so in a tone of denial and disbelief:  #8220;Could you imagine if I lose? #8221; he asked a crowd Friday. In private, most members of Mr. Trump #8217;s team are grappling with a different reality. Away from their candidate and the television cameras, some of Mr. Trump #8217;s aides are quietly conceding just how dire his political predicament appears to be, and his inner circle has returned to a state of recriminations and backbiting. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, is drawing furious blame from the president and some political advisers for his handling of Mr. Trump #8217;s recent hospitalization, and he is seen as unlikely to hold onto his job past Election Day. Mr. Trump #8217;s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, has maintained to senior Republicans that the president has a path forward in the race but at times has conceded it is narrow. Some midlevel aides on the Trump campaign have even begun inquiring about employment on Capitol Hill after the election, apparently under the assumption that there will not be a second Trump administration for them to serve in. Less than three weeks before Election Day, there is now an extraordinary gulf separating Mr. Trump #8217;s experience of the campaign from the more sobering political assessments of a number of party officials and operatives, according to interviews with nearly a dozen Republican strategists, White House allies and elected officials. Among some of Mr. Trump #8217;s lieutenants, there is an attitude of grit mixed with resignation: a sense that the best they can do for the final stretch is to keep the president occupied, happy and off Twitter as much as possible, rather than producing a major shift in strategy. Often, their biggest obstacle is Mr. Trump himself. Instead of a delivering a focused closing message aimed at changing people #8217;s perceptions about his handling of the coronavirus, or making a case for why he can revive the economy better than Mr. Biden can, Mr. Trump is spending the remaining days on a familiar mix of personal grievances, attacks on his opponents and obfuscations. He has portrayed himself as a victim, dodged questions about his own coronavirus testing, attacked his attorney general and the F.B.I. director and equivocated on the benefits of mask-wearing.. Rather than drawing a consistent contrast with Mr. Biden on the economy, strategists say, the president #8217;s preference is to attack Mr. Biden #8217;s son Hunter over his business dealings and to hurl personal insults like  #8220;Sleepy Joe #8221; against a candidate whose favorability ratings are much higher than Mr. Trump #8217;s.  #8220;A lot of Republican consultants are frustrated because we want the president #8217;s campaign to be laser-focused on the economy, #8221; said David Kochel, a Republican strategist in Iowa.  #8220;Their best message is: Trump built a great economy #8221; and Covid-19 damaged it, and Mr. Trump is a better option than Mr. Biden to restore it, he said.  #8220;Our base loves the stuff about Hunter Biden, laptops and Mayor Giuliani, #8221; Mr. Kochel added.  #8220;But they #8217;re already voting for Trump. #8221; Before Mr. Trump #8217;s upset win in 2016, his campaign also mixed public boasting with private anxiety about the apparent likelihood of defeat. But then, unlike now, Mr. Trump closed the race with a jackhammer message attacking Hillary Clinton as a corrupt insider and promising sweeping economic changes  #8212; an argument far clearer than what he is offering today. Mr. Stepien and other campaign leaders, including Jason Miller, a senior strategist, have stressed to Republicans in Washington that they expect to outperform the public polls. They say their own data suggests a closer race in a number of states, including Arizona and Pennsylvania, than surveys conducted by news organizations. They are wagering that voter registration and the turnout machinery Mr. Trump #8217;s team has built over the past four years will ultimately give them an edge in narrowly divided states on Election Day. Still, some prominent Republicans have noted in newly direct language the possibility  #8212; and even the likelihood  #8212; of defeat for the president. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally, said this week that Democrats had  #8220;a good chance of winning the White House, #8221; while Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said his party might be facing a  #8220;blood bath. #8221; Though fear of retaliation by Mr. Trump has muzzled most members of the party, strategists are deeply concerned that Mr. Trump might spend the final weeks of the campaign entertaining and energizing his existing supporters while eschewing any concerted effort to find new ones  #8212; an approach that could cripple other Republicans running for office. Ken Spain, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Trump was  #8220;not delivering a consistent message at the most critical juncture of the campaign. #8221;  #8220;The president appears to have doubled down on a base election strategy, #8221; he said,  #8220;while Republicans down ballot must figure out a way to appeal to independent voters in states like North Carolina and Maine and Michigan. #8221; Mr. Trump #8217;s advisers are hopeful they can use the days through the next debate to change the trajectory of the race. The president is not likely to hold formal debate preparation sessions, in no small part because half of the people in his previous sessions, including Mr. Trump, contracted the coronavirus. There is also growing frustration among congressional Republicans that the White House has not driven a strong positive message about Judge Amy Coney Barrett #8217;s Supreme Court nomination  #8212; a confirmation battle that Republicans until recently regarded as their best chance for a political turnaround. Republicans and allies of the president have trained their ire specifically on Mr. Meadows, viewing some of his actions, like showing up at Ms. Barrett #8217;s hearings, as a form of personal brand-building."</TEXT>
