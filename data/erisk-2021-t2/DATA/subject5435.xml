    <TITLE>NDP Leadership Race Phone Calls</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-29 23:30:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got a call from two campaigns for NDP federal leader today. One was Charlie Angus, who called via automation of his voice to invite me to a teleconfernce townhall Q amp;A thing to tomorrow, which even though I'm supporting Guy, I might attend anyway as its a ranked ballot. Someone from Niki Ashton's campaign called me and was very charming and friendly, and while Niki hasn't impressed me, that young woman from her campaign did. She asked me if I would support Niki and I was honest and said and said it was because of Niki being too much identity politics, and I was expecting an angry response, but she actually seem sympathetic and understanding and instead of getting upset pointed towards Niki's economic policy. Over all after talking with that young woman, Niki Ashton won't be high on my ballot, but in hindsight, I might suck my MRA pride and put her on my ballot after all, abit in 4th. Very impressive young woman (the campaign worker, Niki is a whole other kettle of issues). The young woman wasn't pushy at all either, which I liked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously I'm not running but this is what it would look like if I was running. Not just BI, but GBI, but start with BI in stages. A Federal University that focuses on areas of federal jurisdiction such as FN education, international campuses as a form of foreign aid, and intraprovincial campuses. Ordinary universities are provincial jurisdiction, but this uses loopholes such as FN education being Federal Juristion, the military too, and so on. In a addition to the Army/Navy/Air force elements of the Canadian Armed Forces, I'd add a Humanitarian/Scientific division. Pharmacare, dentacare, and expanded mental health. Have the BoC take on federal, provincial, and municiple debt interest free, like it used to before Pierre Trudeau screwed that up in 1974. An investment fund for innovation in cost saving medical/construction/energy technology like more affordable diagnostic equipment, Roman concrete, and, so this would improvement access and affordiblity. Make sure immigrants get proper accreditation in their trained professions before immigrating, using the Federal Canadian University International Campuses to do so. Nationalize and the Internet Infrastructure nationally. A freedom of speech defence fund, for security support so no event gets cancelled because of security concerns caused by those who desire to silence voices they don't agree with.</TEXT>

Wab's challenger for the leadership lost 3 to 1, but now countless NDPers are having defend a man even they don't believe is innocent. I am an exception, Wab was never convicted and he should be treated as innocent. Still even as an NDP member I believe the NDP has this coming for so many members buying into feminist bullshit. It's just frustrating because most will learn NOTHING FROM THIS, and I will continue to have to deal with feminist BS because the NDP is the least objectionable option. At least I live in Ontario so I don't have to deal with the fall out. It is its own purgatory being an MRA Dipper (NDP supporter).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Should Jagmeet run in Outremont? Okay hear me out, people were complaining about Jagmeet not having a seat, and my first thought was it was goofy to expect that when no good seats we're available, I mean Navdeep is unlikely retire, he doesn't want look like vulture by going after Scarbough Agricourt. So we're would he run that is realistic? Outremont. It's a winnable riding, it's currently held by NDP leader Tom Mulcair. Mulcair is already retiring some time around Christmas, so Jagmeet doesn't have to ask someone to resign. Outremont has a great NDP organization, built by Mulcair himself, who can campaign directly for Jagmeet Singh. And it would be a great opportunity for Singh to start building a relationship with Quebec. As the Sikh thing, Outremont is a multicultural riding and cosmopolitan, so I don't see it as being a problem. Plus Mulcair isn't retiring right away, so it gives Singh time to do whatever he feels is needed out side of Parliament before running.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HW is crippled with Parkensons and he explained his action, admitted to them, and explained that he doesn't have the arm strength to keep his arm at waist level, and so sometimes it falls down to the ass, and his joke and butt pat was intended to defuse the situation, and he sincerely apologized. If these were kind of people they would accept his apology, but refuse his money. Instead of they take a sweet payout of cold hard cash from a guy going through hell with Parkinson, these are victims, they are over priced prostitutes, if you are really sexually assaulted you go for jail time, not the cash fucking prize from a disabled man. Gods I getting sick of this sexual victim culture, where people act like someone whistling at you is treated like it's a savage gangrape. I say it again this doesn't end well, this witch hunt, this is only early days of the hysteria it's going to get a hell of a lot worse. I hope none of these compassion less women find themselves in the condition that this poor bastard is.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Its time to admit, the MRM got played on Weinstein</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-27 19:05:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I bought into the Weinstein is a sex predator narravtive, so I own my shit amd share the blame. I've been putting it all together to day, something wasn't right, but I didn't really know what, but I went with the dominate narrative because the DA taking cash from Weinstein's lawyer after dropping charges was sleazy as fuck (I still do, that DA needs to resign), and the audio from the sting, although I hadn't heard the whole thing, the shear volume of accusation, and yets be honestly, no one want to come off as the apologist for someone everyone sees as a sex predatory, no one wants to look like the "rape apologist". But after reading the article I posted eariler, all the puzzle pieces came together. I think Weinstein was a player, a PUA who used his status to look successful and to project sexual dominance, but I no longer think he is guilty of sexual assault or sexual harrassment. Weinsteins career was winding down, and he'd pissed off alot of people, including Woody Allen's son, who'd pissed off when he helped save Woody Allen's career. So the accusations start flowing after the first accusation against Weinstein gets published and they come fast and hard, its looking bad for Weinstein and he starts panicking. He knows he is no saint, he does like getting laid, he's a player after all who uses his status to bat in a league beyond the one who would normally bat in. He turns to his "friend" feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom who acts like she is in his corner, then promptly fucks him over. He advises him to say he's getting help, tells him that if he shows contrition that he will get a second chance, that he can save everything he's worked so fucking hard for. She lied, waited until he had said things that sounded incriminating, and then when he was away at rehab for "sex addicts", FUCKING LEFT HIM, to fend for himself, she resigned from his legal team having done her damage, and infliciting more with the bad optics, his own lawyer doesn't believe him. Those who come out in his defence, like Libdsay Lohan, Oliver Stone get pounced on, those close to him like his brother, Marily Streep, and others. He cut off from any kind of support system and anyone who might have proof of his innocence of any of these accusations is now too afraid to speak out. Alyssa Milano starts the hashtag #Metoo and its time for phase II, expanding the accusations beyond Weinstein, with #Metoo being a name which screams out for all attentions seeker to post too it, which allows it to take the hysterics to go to the next level and spread. Its too success in fact, because it had the unintended side effect of drawing me to it. Now we have a raging wild fire, accusations at flying all over the place, scores are being settled, things keep accelorating uncontrollable, people are being swept up into it like a good witch hunt, even MRAs and the likes of Ben Shapiro and Milo Yilomopolis (you know last name) get conned into joining in and being played by the feminists). So for sacrificing Weinstein, they don't just manipulate Hollywood, the Feminists now own it, they have the right, not just the left feeding its witch hunt which boosts its power, it even fooled us in the MRM. Now lets look at some of the accusations. Its time to think like a PUA, how would a PUA with their innate knowledge of seduction and women look at this? There is the one I posted last where the actress gets invited to get to lunch with Weinstein, invited to his home to watch a movie AT HIS HOME, he then takes her on a tour of his house, offers a massage, she offers him a massage instead, gives him one, then leaves. At no point is any of this in a professional enviroment, not an office, not a movie studio, not a space where auditions take place, he took and then toom her home after sending his limo for her. In PUA terms, he gave her possible deniablity to get passed her antislut defence, he then did several venue changes, classic PUA move, a mini venue change (different nearby locations with in his home), took her to his bedroom, asked for a massage (sexual when its in your bedroom, but not too sexual plausible deniablity, so her antislut defence doesn't activate and sbe doesn't freak out), she gives a massage, but then he blows it and Mr. All Powerful gets rejected and she leaves. She invites to a second date, but he declines, perhaps playing hard to get, but later invites her to dinner , and suggests she invite friends, again so her antislut defence doesn't fire up. He's charming, she admits it, but eventually he tries to close, but he over plays it, he's too blunt, and she freaks out. The date ends soon after, he calls her a cab and like a gentlemen, pays for it, tell her basically that he's not going to retailate for the rejection, but she earned no favours either, far enough. Much later when she is more successful and marketable, he comes to her with a role, apologizes (fucking stupid) likely just trying to make it clear this was actual business and not an attempt at seduction. She says no, but Weinstein the business man sees opportunity, and offers a bigger role (yeah so much his ruining women who doesn't agree to sleep sith him, he offers them jobs instead), and tries to pimp out some hansome actor (who is the one who should be pissed in all this) with an offer of a love seen in the movie. She turns him down, her career is on the upswing, she doesn't need him then, but she leaves the door open just incase things turn south later. And we are to believe this is a victim of sexual harrassment. She intended to be his latest accuser, instead she become his greatest defence so far, his in a sense alby. This is one case, one case that I took apart with ease. There will be more. I'm ripping this shit open, putting it under the microscope like I should have on day one, and exposing it ALL!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What I found out about the Divine Soul</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-06 02:08:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I found this out on Enworld, but the Divine Soul is basically the same as the last Favoured Soul, with a couple of minor changes. 1. The only Alignment thing Mearls talked about is very minor, instead of just getting Cure Wounds baked in, you get 1 spell linked to alignment baked in, but you can trade it in at higher levels for another cleric spell. I don't know what 1st level spell is linked to what alignment, except cure wounds with good, but they can be traded out by level two, so it really doesn't matter too much. I think they all come from the cleric spell list. So your going to have at least 1 cleric spell minium, but at level 2 its basically your choice as to which one. This bonus spell known doesn't count towards total spells known. This appears to be the biggest change. Seriously your choice matters for all of one level. 2. Angelic Wings is now called Otherworldly Wings, that might be just a cosmetic change in name, I didn't ask about any pure fluff changes, although Mearl's video on it already covered that mostly. 3. Empowered Healing is still in, I thought it would have been replaced, both because its too weak so it will almost never be used, but also to fit the the whole alignment thing. Not a huge deal. 4. Favoured of the Gods is still in, which is good because I liked the flavour of those minimiracles. 5. Unearthly recovery is still in, not the most flavorful feature, but certainly of useful, and its simple to amp up by anything that bumps up maximum hps, higher con, dwarf (I forget which subrace), toughness feat, ect... 6. You still get Divine Magic, so you still choose spells from the Cleric and Sorceror Spell List when picking spells known, which is really the feature that makes this subclass worth picking in the first place, everything else is gravy.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unorthadox Exploration of Haphaestus: Volcano Energy, BDSM, Magic, and Masculinity.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-30 16:44:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>For years now I have been exploring via visualizations Vulcanic Engeries, which in my experience are very power, very energetic, maculine energies. I'd picture myself in the centre of a huge Caldera of a Vulcano, which then erupts, with the torrent of lava and vulcanic lightning filling me with its power, burning, but not consuming me. Its a very sexual sensation, vulcanos are the ultimate phallic symbol in nature. Rescently this lead me to a moment of clarity, a moment of connections. I don't remember what triggered it, although I believe my taking certain supliments helped, but my mind jumped from Vulcanoes, to Haphaestus, and that drew me to read more about him and comparing different myths to each other and my personal experiences, I started making connections that lead to revelations. Haphaestus is a god of BDSM. The usual perpective on Haphaestus is that he is simply the disabled God of smiths, craftmenship, Vulcanos and fire, who was humiliated by his wife and Ares. Part of this is true, but I realized another level to him. He was the binder of Gods and Titians, his net bond Aphrodite and Ares, his throne bound his mother Queen of the Gods till he got what he wanted, his chains bound Promeathus while he was being tortured, the girdle he created for Aphrodite made her irrestiblable to men, bind their lusts to her. As the Smith of the Gods many deities drew their power through him, he made Zeus' Bolts of Lightning for example. And he created his own slave girls out of gold, aka servitors in occult terms. Tie all this to the power of vulcanic energy and I realized the shear power and masculine wisdom he offered. Just thought I'm share. Any questions, comments, insights to add?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Damar Cardassian Intel Science Dreadnought with console set King of Synergy Review</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-24 00:23:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is my first and only full science ship so I've never used a Sensor analysis before I like it. The ship feels like a Dreadnought Carrier that trades a hangar bay for a secondary deflector dish and Sensor Analysis. The Damar has killer synergy. Sensor Anaylsis and Gather Intel can drop DR on targets allowing your Yukuwas, Photonic Decoy, Cardassian Mobile Torpedo Platform and Cardassian Spiral Wave Disruptor Platforms to do more damage. The Yukuwas and shield generator are good at debuffing targets and all the Spiral Wave weapons have the dual debuffing procs. The Cardassian Shield Generating Platform heals the shields on all your pets, allies, and self keeping them alive to defend it. Most of the pets have good to great hull as does the Damar itself, which also has good shields. I love the trait, hit Jam Sensors (which has a lower CD then Evade Target Lock) and a second Damar class ship appears armed with its own spiral wave dusruptors, photon torpedo, and feedback pulse. Its like a rapid version of photonic fleet. I also recommend using the Gorn Repair Console and the Drone Guardians console for more pets that benifit from the shield generator. Drop the support platform cluster and the Repair Platform and one heals that other, while the other offers a stealth bonus. Also if you have the whole set the mobile torp platform can be up 100% of the time. With its Torpedo Spread 3 and Torp Salvo 3 and its Photon Torpedoes and good hull its like a frigate that skipped energy weapons for rocking projectiles (the Spriral Wave Platforms help to make up for the lack up energy weapons, they even have fire at will II and Beam Overload I). I haven't tried the Elite Yukuwas only the Basic Ones nutbI hear that they do okay at hitting enemies with their Dual Beam Banks. I hope that is true. I have Scramble Fighters on the character I tested this on, so that helped the basic Yukuwa. I also used Bionueral Warhead which also benifited from things like Sensor Analysis and the shield generator platform. Cloaking is fun because the Damar is a great ambush predator, get close to target, decloak, hit it with Sensor Analysis, Gather Intel (which is a fun machanic), trigger you consoles and weapons. They Shield generator platform keeps it from moving much. Will likely add Tractor Mines to future builds. The ship is also beautiful, I spent some time trying figure out where it put stuff like secindary deflector, hangar bay, and Intel Craft (for Gather Intel) launcher. The Cloak Visual is really lovely. The set bonus is great, bonus disruptor damage, fire cycling haste, and Energy Weapon Effiency make for a nice combined boost to damage, akin to an okay tac console, the Dsruptor resistance boost is nice when facing Cardassians, Klingons, Orions, Gorn, Naasucians, Krenium, and others that use Disruptors (very common damage type in game), and cutting the CD on the consoles is really nice allowing frequent use of the consoles. The Spiral Wave Blast benifits from things that boost your disruptor weapons, its like turning one of your console slots into a special weapon slot. I got it dealing around 14,000 damage to all enemies in 180 degrees of my front arc. It also looks cool like an unleashed inferno. I'm happy with the hull and shields on the ship. Weaknesses are low turn rate, impulse speed, Interia, and weak on engineering, and its not as flexible in build types as other ships, no universal seats above ensign, its really focused and good at Intel and Science powers, so its a ship of trickery and cunning. To make up for the low engineering seating I use the doffs that lower Engineering Team CD, plus one of the consoles boosts the skill that reduces Engineering CDs. Its great on power levels with bonus power equal to a cruiser (+10 to Aux power and 10 to Weapons power). The ship really benifits from the bonus Aux power with cloak, sci/intel powers, and cutting Hangar Bay CDs. I like the extra weapon slot in the front. The ship is great value for Zen, as not only is it a great ship in its own right, almost anything you get with it in its slots can be used in ANY ship, from its Yukuwa Frigates, its console, and its trait. Speaking of the trait, its clearly inspired by the NPC Keldon Cruisers trick of summoning its own Photonic Decoy. Speaking of the Keldon I here it can use the Spiral Wave Disruptor Lance Console (which I don't have), but that is pretty cool. It can use dual cannons, but I don't. Hands down one of the best ships in the game. Anyone else wish to share their own reviews of the Damar?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-08 21:27:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>This subreddit has been gazing too long into the abyss of feminism, because I see it increasingly adopting some of its worst traits. Purtianism, obsessing over an bitch that done something wrong or even perceived as wrong (I mean I got the point about double standards the first time, it's now into the hundreds). Here is why I became an MRA. 1) To end domestic violence including against men, not to whine because someone touched my shoulder or ass without asking first (yes I have experienced both, some how I managed to survive the experience). My Dad's best friend was beaten by his SO and eventually murdered, my mom was beaten by her ex, she got help and the bad guy went to jail,my Dad's best friend didn't and ended up dead. 2. To fix education, everyone has a right to quality education, but a flawed and sexist system means boys aren't getting one. 3. To protect due process 4. To protect freedom of speech 5. To get more support for men's health 6. To fight against the demonization of men. 7. Intactivism 8. Fix Divorce laws I did not become an MRA to whine every time a woman makes a joke about men, I did not join because I wanted my turn at the #Metoo trough, and so on. I just think we can do better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The last bunch of times I have had sexual relations with women (different woman) I've felt guilty for complimenting them. I love giving compliments, especially to woman I get naked with, but lately in the back of my mind, I'm accusing myself of feeding gynocentrism. Thing is I know this is irrational, that I have been well treated and that these women deserve the compliments and I enjoy giving them, but this concern doesn't go away.

    <TEXT>Okay as I understand it the enchantment is not linked to a guild, although the quote suggests Selysanian for example and it plays better with Selysanian mechanics then Boros mechanics. I thought Angels are mostly a Boros thing, with Orzhov having it's own Deathpact and Despair Angels. This seems like any white mana faction can summon up (or create?) a hoard of Angels. And from the art of the card and the token they don't look like Orzhov or Boros angels, the armour is different and they look different and they don't seem to have loyalty to any guild, Boros, Orzhov, Azrious, Selsyania can all cast this enchantment. So who are these Angels and we're do they come from and could they be created by the spell itself?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the NDPs weaknesses is getting votes from men, it does much better among women, but it actually puts an effort into attracting women's votes by dealing with what it sees as women's issues, merely having a part of the platform alone sends the message women matter to the NDP, there is no equivilant for men, and that too sends a message, one that the NDP needs to stop sending. Some prosals to help the NDP reach out to men and boys. End solitairy confinement. Equal Healthcare research funding for men's health Equal funding for Domestic Violence Shelters for hetro men and GLBT+ (new funding) Better police training for dealing with male victims of female on male violence, too often male victims are arrested instead of female perps. The province should take over child support payments of poor father until they can get themselves out of poverty. Shared Custody should be the default position in divorces Easiest sell even to feminists, equal paternity leave Officially recognize international men's day Better labour safety laws, if you don't think this is a gendered issue it is, men make up over 90's of workplace injuries and deaths. Fairer sentancing in courts, men get harsher punishments then women for the exact same crime. Do the something about the education gap, boys are increasingly falling behind in education, and many are being the overly drugged into zombie hood.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ravnica Beastiary Speculation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-23 00:30:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been reading through the Planeshift articles, especially the Bestiaries to get an idea of what to expect from Ravnica's Beastiary. The way they are organized is heavily by type. So there would be an sections on broad Angel, beasts, demons, horrors, undead, giants, and more particular creatures. With in each section are a over view of how these creatures fit into the setting, what they look like, and so on. They then either say use the stats from creature X from the MM (or Volo's Guide to Monsters in at least one case), sometimes with a fluff or minor revision to the stat block, and in other cases when a creature is radically different from anything in the MM (or VGTM), they give you a new stat block. As I understand it his formula will contiinue for GGR. Still I believe they will be more picky about stats from the MM being a good representation of a creatures abilities before they say use creature X's stats to represent Y. Example Angels for the Planeshift articles just use regular Angel stats, Devas for rank and file Angels and Plantars and Solars for special more powerful Angels. This won't work for Ravnica, because Angels on Ravnica are more diverse in outlook, function, appearance, and powers, as well that Ravnica Angels show no ability to shape shift like Devas do and Plantars and Solars are too tall for Ravnica Angels. They might use Deva, Plantar, Solar stats for Guildless Angels like Angel of Serenity, whose function and place and abilities appear to be less defined on Ravnica is possible. Demons I think will be a mix, some will just use the stats of regular D amp;D demons where it makes sense, but obviously Rakdos gets his own stat block, and any demon that stands out as too different from MM demons will get it's own stat block. For Dragons Niv Mizzet will be in. Pit Dragons and Hypersonic Dragons seem different enough from anything in the MM, so they should get their own stat. Sphinxes, aside from Isperia who will get her own stat block, will just use the MM stats, about they might remove the time traveling abilities. If they draw monsters from the current set they might have A Nightmare Dream Eating Sphinx stat block. Drakes I think they will have Crackling Drake at least and maybe Tower Drake as stat blocks. Most Weirds will be stat blocks, as their is nothing that can properly emulate them. Elementals will be likely use plant creatures and regular elementals in some cases, but some will require new stat blocks. Eelhawks might just use hawk stats, maybe with lightening damage, Squidflies might need new stats, and same with Waspcrabs. Omniphibian will need new stats, no frog creatures in 5e can make it's environment resemble it. Some less frog creature will like just use giant and regular from stats. One type of Imp will just use regular imp stats, but odder ones like Stink Weed Imp might get their own stat. I don't think any Devils will get their own stats, I think they will just use regular stats, but with a change in alignment perhaps. I think Shrieking Gargoyles will use regular Gargolye Stats, but Dominator Gargoyles will use new stats. Fairies will just use the stats of Nixies and Pixies and the like. I because Ravnica's Dryads are plant like as MM and Ixalan Dryads, mostly looking like human attractive females with leaves for hair, they will use new stats for them. I could be wrong. I think the MM Dryads stats will be used for Carven Cryprids instead. Purple Wurms will be used for one of even several types of Wurm, but not all. Undead and some of the other more Unique Wurms will get their own stats. I think the Giant Insects of the Golgori will be a mix, some new stats for the more unique bugs. Giants will likely just use Stone Giant stats, but maybe will an additional abilities depending on the giant's role. Rakdos Giants might use Hill Giant or Frost Giant stats instead. Archons will get their own stats, there is nothing like them in the MM. Felidars are Celestials in the Planeshift articles with abilities similar to Unicorns, but more cat like. I think Felidars will still be Celestial and get a stat block, but be made more unique from from Unicorns in abilities. Specters are too different from regular D amp;D Specters, they are the black mana version of Archons, but Undead. They might make them unique stats or just use regular specters, but add mounts. Hard to say. I think some of the Undead will get unique stats, especially the really weird stuff like Necrophilages, others will be get basic undead stats, but in the case of the Orzhov incorporeal undead, will get some kind of special ability or mechanic. Guildless Vampires will probably just use regular Vampire stats. Orzhov Vampires might use a regular Vampire Stats, or a mix of Regular Vampire Stats and Stats for a Vampire that casts divine magic. Dimir Psychic Vampires and Moroii and Skeletonal Vampire will get new stats. Thrulls I think will get new stat blocks, they are too different from anything in D amp;D. Small change they might use Flesh Golems for one type, but I don't think they will be constructs. There are a variety of unique beasts like Indiks, Alms Beasts, and so on. I think only the ones with unique attacks will get new stats. Alms Beast might just use dinosaur stats. Indiks will get stats I think. Most Gruul Beasts will get unique stats. Griffons will just use Griffon stay from the MM. I think a lot of creatures like Minotaur Reckoner will get NPC templates. Unique NPCs like Rakdos will be in the NPC section and obviously get stats. Most Horrors will get unique stats. I hope spy bugs get their own stats. Ultimately I think we will get 30 to 40 new monster stat blocks not including NPCs (of which we get over 10). Plenty of refluffed MM Monsters. Am I also curious which monsters might find themselves reprinted in future products. My guess, Felidar, Angels, and maybe the Archon, D amp;D doesn't have nearly as many Celestial creatures as it does fiends, undead, Dragons, fey, and so on, even if you include every celestial Eladarin, Guardinal, and Traditional Arch on type. A demon type or two. Some of the cooler horrors. I don't think Thrulls will, but I hope I'm wrong, I could see Thay creating Thrulls. Also I hope that the way they do up the fluff for started creatures explores a broader place within D amp;D then just Ravnica.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-26 00:58:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here are my reasons. 1. She has more History on the plane of Ravnica 2. She is a Necromancer which fits the themes of Orzhov better then Kaya. 3. Yes Liliana has traditional been monoblack, but she started out as a noble healer which suggests ealier roots in white. Monocolor planeswalkers have changed to multi colour before. 4. She has summon Angels before, the Angel of Desolation, so she has some idea on how to summon/create Angels. And yes to summon Angel of Desolation requires only black mana, but the kicker requires white mana, so to get the most of her requires both of Orzhov's colours. 5. She is already working for Bolas.</TEXT>

Who is Zarichi and what role does this God(?) Have in the Setting. Lord of the Void, what is the Void in Ravnica terms, like what part of Ravnica's cosmology does it fit into? Is it Aygm, or another metaplane? The Order of the Stars, does anyone know anything about what this order believes? Is it connected to Zarichi? Seperate? Are there any other important guildless organizations beyond the Gateless, Haazda, and these ones mentioned above?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-31 18:12:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>What will be the consequences of uniting D amp;D and MtG cosmology? Doesn't this change the nature of both? Obviously I refer to Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica. I'll give you an example. The fact that Etherealness spell works suggests that Ravnica has it's own Ethereal Plane, because the spell works on Ravnica. Also before there was no way to travel between planes without a spark, except for maybe the Weatherlight Ship or Planar Bridge, Eldrazi. But now you have spells like Banish, Conjure X spells, Summon Lesser Demon, Summon Greater Demon, Planar Ally, Planeshift, Gate. And Planar themed Subclasses like Horizon Walker on Ravnica. And Jeremy Crawford has said the Ravnica is on the Material Plane, that makes Ravnica more of Crystal Sphere then a plane of it's own. What does Aether and the Blind Eternities do the Phlogiston of D amp;D? Are the Blind Eternitites a region within the Phlogiston that somehow became more chaotic? Jeremy Crawford has said that if one knows the code to a Teleportation Circle on Ravnica, one can teleport from any normal crystal sphere world like say Toril or Kyrnn or Oeril to Ravnica and visversa. According to him it can also be reached by Spelljammers and has a Crystal Sphere. So doesn't this mixing alter a lot of the core assumptions in both D amp;D and MtG about both cosmology, planar travel and maybe even Gods? If an FR Cleric uses a Teleportation circle to get to Ravnica, can they still draw magic from their God?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Philophical Realization: Azathoth is the perfect metaphor for the multiverse. I've read various theories in physics about the multiverse and it dawned on me, Azathoth, blind idiot god, is the perfect metaphor for the multiverse, in a Pantheistic sense. What better way to discribe a multiverse that creates ever horror and pleasure, every good and evil, that could possibly happen, in fact somewhere everything does happen, and will happen again, then a blind idiot god. Before Steven Hawking (along with a professor who worked with him on it) died his last theory involved the multiverse and one part of that theory that has not been discussed much is what came before the multiverse in the theory. Before the multiverse there was nothingness. Not an ordinary nothingness, but a nothing that is timeless, a place where abstract ideas like time break down. If the source of the multiverse is truly timeless then it must still exist. Just some thoughts on Azathoth for this Halloween (Samhain).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone know what happened to A Voice for Men Writer Ali Mehraspand? For reference who I'm talking about, the link is below. I don't know what he looks like, I just want to know if he is okay and if he is still writing, he is my favourite MRA writer (along with Karen Straughan). https://www.avoiceformen.com/author/mehraspand/ The last thing I've found that he published was from 2015.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just a weird thought, but when Bolas brings his eternals to Ravnica, could that include the slain Amonkhet gods, plus the Scarab and Loctus Gods? I mean Bolas did mean for the Gods to be "tested", so it's possible that all but one could be turned into Eternals right?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Chilling Adventurers of Sabrina is feminist on the outside, antifeminist and MRA on the inside sort of.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-08 12:06:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay I finally watching Sabrina's first season. As we all know it starts off preaching feminism, W.I.C.C.A club for example, but after Sabrina's trial W.I.C.C.A club is forgotten. Okay in interviews the creators of the show have said Satan is meant to be the Patcharchy, but for "The Patrcharchy" he sure does like giving women a lot of power. See Satan, via one of his female minions, is actually the source of much of the shows feminism, it's largely used to manipulate Sabrina into doing the Dark Lords will. And most of the women of the show aside from Sabrina's BFF and her grandma are all kind of shades of evil, even Sabrina does some horrifying shit. And for a feminist Sabrina spends a lot of time killing fellow female witches to protect or trying to protect the men in her life. When two witches use magic to kill Harvey and his brother (killing four other guys in the process), Harvey survives, but his brother dies. Unable to deal with how heart broken Harvey is, Sabrina tries to raise Harvey's brother from the dead by taking those two witches and forcing them to particape in a sacrificial rite, where Sabrina slits one of their throats, killing her. Now Sabrina does raise that witch back from the dead too, but that witch suffers greatly for a time. Of course it goes wrong, and in an attempt to save the soul of Harvey's brother, she kind of causes it's destruction. So Harvey has to put his brother down. Still that is not all the killing Sabrina does of female witches. When her demon teacher raises 13 hanged witches from the dead by murdering a young man, Sabrina ends up stopping these women by singning the book of the beast in exchange for power, and the Burns 13 women to oblivion, body and soul, with he'll fire granted to her by Satan, to protect largely men.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica lore (spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-15 14:56:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay I haven't read the whole book, because I won't have it till the 20th, but I have read much of it thanks to a 4 part series on YouTube. And I've learned a few things. Even if this book isn't Canon in the MtG universe, I don't think it is that different either. One important thing is that Teysa and Taljic's attempt to to over throw the Obdezdat failed, and she is now imprisoned, with her titles stripped from her. What this does to the theory that Teysa is going to hire Kaya to assassinate the Obzedat I'm not sure. The Simic has a Guardian project, which is designed to build an army of hyrids so I think we will see that reflected in the cards. Also it says that Rakdos likely created all the demons of Ravnica, and that he chooses to live on Ravnica, suggesting he might not originally BE from Ravnica. Deathpact Angels seem to be like a set of religions within the religion. Each has their own cult. They are kind of awesome. Archons aren't actually a single being, they technically two separate beings who are so bonded that it merely seems that way, like they can teleport back to their mount. This is mirror by the Night Veil Specter and it's Gloomwing Mount. If it's Gloomwing mount is kill, but the Nightviel Specter survives, it can create a new Gloomwing mount eventually. We get the names of all five members of the Obzedat, but no one knows which are Paruns, because many members just fade away eventually, and others get appointed. Vampires on Ravnica don't share the traditional weaknesses of Vampires. For the Orzhov Debt = Sin. The Azorious are cracking down on Orzhov's protection racket.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Erotic Devotional Fiction (spiritual erotica)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-08 00:23:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Has anyone else done erotic writing as a spiritual act? See I used to write fan fiction and it dawn on me that was kind of a form of worship functionally, and as such it would be worth redirecting to the Gods (I'm neopagan) as an offering. Right now, inspired by Homer, who was deified for his writing of the Illiad, I am writing my sort of none poetic, multi-part erotic religious BDSM epic based on Vulcan/Hapheastus myths, as a religious offering to Hapheastus, God of Fire, Vulcanoes, Blacksmithing, Carpenty, Baking/Cooking (more Roman then a Greek facet), fertility (again more a Roman influence). Why that God instead of say Eros? Because I personally worship Hapheastus, because I noticed an untapped erotic subtext to his mythology (he has a lot of myths where he binds others with invisible restraints, he builds his own golden slave girls and the first woman, and the vulcano is the ultimate symbol in nature of male sexuality, the Vulcano erupts with hot lava sperting into the heavens, it's smoke is so charged that it created Vulcanic lightening, and so on. My first story in the epic is a BDSM, erotically charged version of Throne of Hera/Juno myth, that traps Juno so that only her son can release her, so I thought that could make for a great incest story. Later I plan on tackling the Myth where Aphrodite uses sex to get him to forge Armour for her son, where he captures her and Ares in a net, the creation of the Golden Maidens, his attempted rape of Athena which created the first King of Athens, his partying with Bacchus and his Maenads, and few others. So has anyone done this before and I don't mean, Nun porn, but erotic writing as a spiritual offering?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm backing out of the Gillette Boycotte, I can't lie to myself that it's not an attack on free speech. I got swept up in the moment, but as I calm down, I simply can't ignore the voice of my conscience calling me a hypocrite for using tactics I hate when SJWs, Christians, and others use them. I really tried to be a team player, but I realized I can't betrayed my values by bullying Gillette into silence for saying something I didn't and still think was stupid. It was stupid and hypocritical thing for them to say, but that does not justify my own hypocracy, I have to be true to my values and that includes not bullying someone into silence. I'm pulling my support for this boycotte on all social media platforms were I gave support to it in the first place. Feel free to bash me or call me a traitor if you want, but I have to do what I believe if right and undo my hypocracy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It turns out that the first Pagan Angel reference is in Homer. It really didn't become a major thing until the Neoplatonists. The basic hierarchy is The One - Gods - Archangels - Angels - Daimons - Cosmic Archons - Matter Archon - Heroes - Souls. Each God has their own Archangels and Angels, Daimons, Cosmic Archons (Leaders), Matter Archons (Princes), Heroes, and even Souls. Between all these catagories one could write one hell of a Grimiore of each of the Olympians alone. B</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like obviously it includes classical Greek religion and I think Classical Roman Religion maybe, but what about Neoplatonism, Hellenic Wicca, Discordianism, Religious Stoiacism and other Hellenic Religion/Greek Philosophy interactions? What about discussing the interactions between the religions that gave rise to Classical Greek/Roman Religion, like various Italian and Greek tribes on the Romans and the Mycenians, Minoans, and even Anatolian nations like Curia, Lycia, Lydia, Hittites, possibly Hurrian? I just would like to respectfully know what is concider within bounds for this subreddit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hephaestus</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-01 12:20:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would like to discuss Hephaestus. I find it interesting that from my research so far the origin of his worship appears to be not in Greece proper, but rather Anatolia (Turkey) and the Agean Islands, like Lemnos. That suggests an origin from amoung the Luiwan peoples (Lycians, Curians, Hittites). He would later get absorbed into Greek Religion. Also I find it interesting that most of the Gods derived much of their power and symbols of authority from Hephaestus. Cupids arrows, Aphrodite's girdle, Zeus Lightening, and so on. It seems like the power of importance of Hephaestus might be under estimated. Also has anyone else noticed the BDSM themes in Hwphaestian Mythology? The Throne of Chains, the Bind of Prometheus. Ares of Aprodite in his net.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Merging Neoplatonism and Modal Realism (or more generally multiverse theories).</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-02 16:27:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>With all the multiverse theories in science, philosophy, and religions, I had been exploring the religious and philosophical implications of a multiverse. This lead me to the idea of a higher soul that acted as the common bond between counterparts, which lead me to ask what is that Higher Soul. Then I remembered learning about Plato and his forms in high school, and it dawned me that the unifying element between counterparts would be forms of the self. So using Plato as an example in this reality he was a philosophier, in another he might have been a king, another counterpart of Plato's might have been a farmer, another hunter, another a sailor, and another a soldier and so on. But what would unite all the Plato's would be the Form of Platoness. I know that is not a traditional view of forms, but I think when trying to apply the theory of forms to counterpart theory it makes sense because instead of just being the quality of a single individual Plato, Platoness would be a quality applible to an infinite amount of Plato counterparts. This would also explain what person truely is, when the physical substance (the atoms of a person say Plato) get completely replaced every seven years. Matter comes and goes, but the form remains. That lead to my attention to the theories of Neoplatonism, which has been addictive, if dry at times and challenging. I realized that combining Modal Realism (or other multiverse theories) to Neoplatonism would create changes in both, leading to yet another new kind of Neoplatonism. I'm toying with the names Multiversal Neoplatonism or Counterparts Neoplatonism (suggestions are welcome this is stillba work in progress). So what is the implications for the Gods? It solves the issues of mythological inconsistances for one thing, for among the eminations of a God, would be all the counterparts of a God across the multiverse. This would allow different versions of mythologies to literally exist in different universes, solving mythological paradoxes. I know that Mythology is not take literally in Neoplatonism, but I believe a multiverse opens up literal and none literal understandings of mythology for Neoplatonism. I think this would radically alter the hierarachy of the "superior races" of divinity. It also means that some universes could take more after certain Gods then others. So there could be Apollian Universes, Dionoysian Unviverses, Hephaustian Universes, Athenian Universes, Hermian Universes, Heran Universes, ect..., how universes fit into a hypothetical to the spiritual hierarchy of later Neoplatonism I'm not sure, Demiurgic Archangels of a sort perhaps? This is a work in progress so suggestions and constructive feedback is more then welcome.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Gnosis, Immersion, Stories, and fandom</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-04 20:51:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wrote the below on a Star Trek Online Forum. "It's dawned on me that there is a weird kind of connection between fictional fandom and religion, and that is the goal of Gnosis, or in fandom terms, immersion is gnosis with the story/setting. Why does setting canon (a religious term in its own right) matter? The most common answer in my experience are people saying that breaking canon kills immersion. What is immersion in a story? Its the state where one becomes so engrossed in a story, that one can escape (as in escapism), from suffering and boredom, by becoming one with the story, you are imersed in it. Its no accident that so much of fandom uses religious language, even the word fan is short for/derived from fanatic. Look at how emotionally invested fans become in setting, and the kind of aggressive arguements over canon that occur that take on the character and fervour of religious debates. The reason why its so important is because it's a battle over the qualities of the setting that both shape the immersive experience and the capacity of individuals and groups into engage in the immersion, and avoid immersion breaking elements. Fandom like religion also builds communities with common values, stories, histories, and points of discussion and debate, and the occasional heresy ( example does X violate canon?) Many fans gather around the TV or other device like previous generations gathered around Priests during stories and simular story telling, who acted as a possible vechile through which one could immersion ones self in the stories (and in the case of the Priest via the story as intermediary, immersion with the God/Gods). Of course this isn't the only path to gnosis or immersion, or deepest, but one of the easiest and most common, it doesn't not even require one belief in it in a literalist sense, just temporarily suspend disbelief so one can surrend one self to the story, effectively becoming united with it."

    <TITLE>I bought the Night Sun Tarot, here is my review</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-17 05:15:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay years ago I briefly tried dabbling in tarot cards, using a home made deck, to confusing and disaaterous results. After that I kind of swore off divination, deciding it just wasn't where my talents lay. Fastward a few days ago. I impulse bought the Night Sun Tarot Deck for $37CAD from Chapters. I have absorbed a little bit about Tarot over the years, but not much, so I was functionally a beginner. My first experience with this deck blew my mind. I used the Shiva's Trident Spread as suggested by the small booklet. I asked about my relationship with the Gods I worship and it was so much useful information and insights that it blew my mind. I used both intuition, then advice from the booklet, and finally just kept looking the pictures and noticing a narrative of sorts. It was a lot easier then I expected. The Spread has you seperate the Minor Arcana from the Major Arcana. The Major Arcane are used for past, present, future, kind of like the three card spread I woukd later learn. The Minor Arcana was used under it, one card for positive meaning, representing a resource or trait, and one card for the negative. These two cards also tells you which attribute (Intellectual, Material, Emotional, Creative/Sexual) is most invovled. You then use these cards to bring the three Major Arcana cards into clearer meaning/understanding. No need for reversals (which this deck can't do) or elemental dignities (which it can do), with the Shiva's Trident, but loads of information. This is good because at this point I had no idea what reversal or EDs were. I then started searching the net on everything I could about the Night Sun Deck. I later wanted to try Tarot mediation, so I picked a card that unexpected grabbed me, the Ace of Wands, and mediated upon, its was pleasurable. I love the art of this deck, there are tons if symbols on these cards. I love the Shiva's Trident, I looked at other spreads, but I'm happy with Shiva's Trident, its easy, but has interacting depth to it, and flexiblity. Some of the art is very sexy, which I like, its appeals to my masculine, dominate tastes. Some reviews find the busty females off putting, but I found it appealing. Alot of the repeating themes are used to create narratives of a sort with this deck, which makes sense given who made the deck. It is also inspiring ideas for uses beyond just Tarot Reading, for ritual work, creativity, and mediation. I feel really connected to this deck in a way that really suprises me, given I bought it on an impulsive lark, with skeptism of my own ability to meaningfully use it. So excited for future uses. I will have more to add later, there is some much going on with this deck, and so many inspired ideas already.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Theogony of Shadows</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-18 18:08:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've come up with the Theogony of Shadows, a darker heterodox understanding of Neoplatonism, inspired by Hesiod, Pagan Neoplatonic Philosophers, the concept of Qlippoth, and Modal Realism. The origin, the catalyst of everything is the Primordial Goddess Chaos (ancient Greek meaning). The Chaos of Hesiod, is the One of Neoplatonism, but less idealistic, and more honest then calling this being The Good. Chaos cast a "Shadow" Tartarus, who is beyond nonexistance in the same way as that Chaos is beyond existance. Tarturus is the Father of Evil, but is beyond the concept of evil, the same way that Chaos is beyond the concept of good. In a sense Tartarus is sort of an Antigod or Ungod. They are the One ineffable. Chaos/Tarturas are beyond time and space, and so they are unchanging, but like Lovecrafts concept of Azathoth, they/it dream/eminate. They eminate the Simple One, the Goddess Nyx, who casts her own Shadow Eberus. From Nyx/Eberus eminate the, the Goddess Hemera, the One Existant, who lower aspects of which are Aeon and Paradigm, the Pre-essental Demiurge and whose Shadow is Aether. The lower aspect of Hemera overlaps with the Noetic Realm. From Hemera/Aether via Aeon and Paradigm eminate the Titans, the Henads, starting with Gaia and Uranus, and descending from them. The Shadow of Cronos is Typhon. The other Titans also cast their own Shadows. From the Titans eminate the Psychic Realms, the Whole Soul Pontus, the Celestial Demiurge who casts Echidna as her Shadow. From Pontus many World Souls, Oureas issue forth, each of which creates it's own Generative World (usually filled with Planets, Suns, ect...). These are too numerous to list. Picture the World Soul as an Ocean with each mountainous Oureas dotting the Ocean like islands, all isolated from each other, but not from Pontus the Ocean. The hundred headed and hundred armed Hecatonchires represents the Shadows of the Oureas. From the World Souls and Generative Worlds eminate Hypercosmic Gods, like the Olympians and others. The minds and spirits of the Hypercosmic Gods are so vast that they both individuals, and realms in their own right. From the Hypercosmic Gods eminate Rational/Psychic Souls (which descend), Archangels, and the Hyperencomsic Gods and from the Hyperencosmic Liberated Gods eminate Angels and Encosmic Gods and from the Encosmic Gods eminate the Guardian Daimons/Angels who guide humanity whose Shadow are the Lords of Karma, who punish and reward and tempt. From Daimons and Lords of Karma eminate Heroes/Saints/Avatars/Prophets/Monsters, who incarnate and appear in visions to easier interact with Incarnated Humanity (other intelligent life forms). These have their own irrational souls. From the interaction of Rational/Psychic Souls and Matter shapes Irrational/Generative Souls, Irrational Souls and Bodies define the limits a incarnated Rational Soul can do. The Vechile of the Soul is imagination and it's via imagination that we interact with higher realms, the generative realm, counterparts and their worlds, ect... I don't believe in pure souls, because I don't buy the idea that evil comes from matter, it comes from above along with Gods, matter only ends up the canvas and context. Also I see Henosis as more temporary escapism and spiritual education, not permanent escape from the realm of Generation. Humanity and animals have a job to do in the Generative Realm, and while directly observing the Gods has it's uses, Souls can't just exist ogling Gods for eternity, eventually they have to invovle themselves in the Realm of Generation again. Still lower then human souls Thoughtforms Eminate from both rational soul and irrational souls, but without support, remerge with the soul it comes from. Thought forms aren't completely tied to flesh however, but are an expression of the vechile of the soul, so they can act as bridge to aspects of higher beings or counterparts or even other people. The Sublte Daimons, aka Elementals are more powerful then rational/irrational human souls, but are do not possess a rational soul nor free will and as such are slaves to their nature, allowing weaker humans to utilize them. I believe the Psychic Censor is a powerful elemental or type of Elemental that instinctively does Quantum Error Correction to keep matter stable, which means it sometimes messes up your spells without meaning too. This is a darker view of Neoplatonism, inspired at times by Hesiod, although I break with his influence at times, especially the role of Gaia, seeing Hemera as the mother of the Titans, with Gaia/Uranus the mother of Zeus, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, ect..., this is influenced by a more Modern understanding of Astronomy. It also kind of interduces an element of dualism, but not really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was looking at Kaballah's tree of life, not my thing, but power to you, and thinking about Neoplatonism. Eariler I had been thinking about the nature of the Gods and how some people viewed them as Archetypes, others literally, others are forms or henads, others as thoughtforms/ergores, others as aspects of a more powerful god, others view them as indivuals and most likely more ways. But one that just occurred that one can also explore the Gods as Planes/Places. Think about how vast the minds and imaginations of the Gods must be. Think about the human memory palace and imagine what it would be like to explore the equvilant of a God's mind. If things like Daimons, Archangels, Angels eminate from each of that Gods, then perhaps it's into the God they visit. Imagine exploring say the 12 Olympians Gods for example with 12 linked Kaballah like systems, each system customized to the nature and aspects of the individual God. I mean in regular Kaballah it's functional split into a second Qlippoth tree as well for "Satan" and like beings. What would such a system look like? Imagine a system of magic that explored the aspects of Aphrodite or Hephaestus, or Zeus, Hermes, Artemis, Athena, Apollo, ect... , and with links to each other. I think that such a system would require careful study of mythology, different aspects of a God, variations of worship, even exploring ancient sycronisms and of course divination, and Neoplatonism.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina declares war on Fatherhood</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-07 19:21:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>As it says in the title. Spoilers below. I have never, ever, seen the very concept of fatherhood attacked in a TV show like this. Even shows that make the Dad look like a doofus for comedic purpose still retain an understanding of the importance of fatherhood. The show has a viceral hatred of the very idea of Fatherhood. Shall we go down the list? Sabrina Spellman has two fathers some how, Edward Spellman, who she suggests pimped out her Mom to Satan at one point, and Satan himself, who not only turns out to be her dad, but who tries to force her into marrying him, her character being both underage and his fucking daughter. Satan also treats Lilith like crap, murders Adam, and tries to unleash the end of days so he can rule the world with his daughter-bride at his side. Rosland's Dad is made to look like a corrupt spiritual leader who is willing to steal another girl's eyes to give to his daughter while conning his flock out of money to pay for the surgery in one vision. Harvey's Dad is abusive. Father Blackwell, refuses to acknowledge Prudence is his Daughter until she tries to murder him, engages his infant daughter to his infant son, tries to murder his adopted daughters Doris and Agatha along with the rest of the coven, has a creed the is an extreme stereotype of 1950's mysgony, zombifies Zelda after marrying her, murders the antipope and frames Anton. Oh and a discussion between Anton and Prudence about their daddy issues makes it clear how unimportant fathers are to the writers. I feel bad for their dad's. They literally demonize fatherhood. Bonus a Church Elder puts their hand on Helda's leg so she kills him, because a tiny bit handsy pass at someone justifies murder in the warped minds of the Sabrina writers. Oh and Sabrina is literally the Feminist Messiah, a rogue anti Chist, who helps make Lilith Queen of Hell. This show takes bat shit crazy feminist show takes feminist nuttiness to the next level. Its still fun at times, and it does horror well at moments, and Weird Sisters are super hot (as is Sabrina who is legal in real life, and Rosland). Some of the acting is really good. A Weird Sister spin off that gets rid of the fatherhood hating feminism shit would be awesome, like a twisted, bad girl Charmed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mapping Neoplatonic Cosmology to Ordinal Polytheism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-08 15:18:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay I recently read a mind blowing paper on Ordinal Polytheism, a Polytheism based on Modal Realism, that appears to be unlike any Polytheism I've ever seen before. But then it dawned on me that thinking about Ordinal Polytheism in a different way, mere shifts in terminalogy and perspective, it maps pretty well to a Neoplatonic Modal Realism. Take ones Local (Actual) God in Modal Realism, which has two main parts, the Kernal and the Shell, each of which have their own parts as each Demiurgic God get more complex. The Kernal corresponds to to the Celestial Demiurge, the Shell the Sublunar Demiurge. Now I tend to think of the Demiurges on all levels as both complex individuals, but also Metapantheons of parts/Gods. Ordinal Polytheism doesn't address the realm of Universals so the Noetic Realm and the Preessential Demiurge is not addressed, and would not be changed. But what it suggests is the lower Demiurges asexually reproduce more power/smarter Demiurges, who create better worlds and then create even better Demiurges in a kind of holy evolution. For some perpective on what I am talking about when it comes to Ordinal Polytheism I'll provide a link below. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-plurality-of-gods/98909091ca4c46915a484077c01661a5d4520344</TEXT>

Of course given the staff of 300 people working on the game, with 27 writers alone its possible all 5e sub/races, sub/classes, backgrounds, feats, FR Gods will be in the game except for Eberron/Ravnica stuff and even then Shifters, Changelings, Centaurs, Minotaurs, Loxodons (called Loxo in FR) are possible.</TEXT>

Instead they should be replaced by a Sexual Blackmail/Extortion law (blackmail an employee into sex go to jail). 5- That "Statory Rape" isn't really rape (still have a 18+ rule for person sex). Honourable mention goes to my position that publicly traded companies are a form of government and should be subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights. But not really an MRM issue.

    <DATE>2019-07-25 09:08:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay I finally figured out how to get Nexus to work, so I tried it out on Callistos, Cutpurses, and Yukawas. Going on memory, 6000-7000 dps on the Elite Callistos, 10,000-11,800 dps on the Elite Cutpurses, 4,000-6,000 on the basic Yukawas, but none of that surprised me that much. What surpised me was how absoutely lethal that Callistos were given their lower DPS then the cutpurses. I mean they just shredded enemies, destroyed them as fast or occasionally faster then the higher DPS Cutpurses. I mean yeah there two Callistos to one Cutpurse hangar bay, but the Cutpurse DPS was still much higher then the Callistos, yet the Callistos has zero problem destroying NPCs at Argala, Ker'rat, or the Badlands. I might try a more detailed parser later to figure out why. Current theory, Callistos were major spikers, especially with Qauntum Torpedo Spead III  #215;4 is just brutal even on Shields in my experience, but its not constant damage. The Curpsepurses had very consistant damage, but no major burst damage. Also Callistos were better against Groups, Cutpurses against single targets, for obvious reasons. Yukawas did okay, but I've decided the Elite Yukawas Photon Torpedo Spread III is worth it. Also the Callistos were alot more responsive to commands and that helped alot. I tried attack, worked great, Escort allow me to shift quickly between ships being escorted, recall returned them to the ship, but they did not actually dock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the Myths about Sophia is that her "sin" was trying to create a new Aeon without her partner, which lead to her Son, the Demiurge being flawed and functional disabled by Aeon standands. This mirrors Hera concieving and giving birth to Hephaestus. There is another myth about Sophia where her son tricked her into descending then with his Angels bind her. In Greco-Roman mythology. Hephaestus tricks Hera into sitting on the Throne of chains and traps her as punishment for tossing him off mount Olymount tree</TEXT>

I'm new to being her fan, I was rooting for Bernie, but now I'm rooting for Tulsi. I want a NDP leader who is like Tulsi. I haven't been this excited for a leader since Jack Layton, sadly she is wasted on the American Democratic Party and its Corporate Seals of a DNC instead.</TEXT>

But Tommy Douglas was the father of Universal Health-care and the first provinicial bill of rights in Canada among countless other achievements and Jack Layton was the first NDP leader to achieve official opposition status and was so well loved when he died by millions of Canadians that Conservative Prime Minister Steven Harper. And Tulsi Gabbard has the same presence, the same folksy charm, the same integrity as these Canadian legends, if only she has enough time to build.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a really under rated philosophy in regards to Witchcraft and Polytheology is Modal Realism. It provides an alternative to Post Modernism that some seem drawn to. You can have Literalist, Jungian, Neoplatonic, and other theological positions with it without contradictions and with sacrificing the concept of objective true (or facts if your prefer). It also shows that mythological contradictions, for Example is Hera Hephaslestus sole parent or are both Zues and Hera equal parents can be resolved by pointing to different counter parts of Hephaestus in different worlds.</TEXT>

I think it can take the single player game to the next level, because instead of just thinking of Secret Tech + Faction Combos + Perks Combos, its becomes Secret Tech + Faction + Perks + Allies Combos. Like if your playing a team with Syndicate Voidtech and Amazon Celestial, you can trade cities so early on you can get Amazon Echo Walker Lancers with Indentured Collars for your Syndicate Player and for your Amazon player you get get Syndicate Bonecrushing Light Bringers and Starguides with Decieving Light. And say one of them captures an Elysium Parks Landmark, you can trade it and its city between allies so that all of them get a chance to build their own Ebots. If you've tried this, what cool tactics have you come up with?</TEXT>

It was bad enough before when the Liberals pulled stunts like this, but right after Trudeau broke his electoral reform promise that would have made sure this wasn't an issue. It is functionally using consquences of Trudeau breaking his word to blackmail people into voting for the very party that lied, is fucking sickening and loathsome. It's obviously being able to do this is why the Liberal broke in the first place, they didn't want to lose their blackmail leverage. I sooner light my ballot on fire then vote for the Trudeau Liberals.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>According to Warren Kinesella Trudeau has a racist pet name for Jagmeet Singh</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-28 13:00:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was listening to the Kinesellacast, and according Warren Trudeau has a racist pet name for Jagmeet Singh, and that he is going to dish on this in his next column. If this can be proven how should Jagmeet Singh react to this news? As a side not Warren has also said that the media was gathering all kinds of stories about Trudeau's past, looking for the "kill shot" now that Blackfacegate has functionally made it open season on Trudeau dodgy past. What many scandals can Trudeau emdorse before we hit the tipping point and Canadians lose patience with Justin Trudeau?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Theology and it's implication in the MtG multiverse</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-07 01:15:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>To start off I'm begin with a Neoplatonic inspired exploration of MtG, with some Modual Realist influences. For those unaware Neoplatonism is usually called a Philosiohy and it is, but it's really a theology and theological lens that has been applied to different religions and influenced others. To simplify things Neoplatonism the universe is divided into a Noetic Realm, a Psychic Realm, and a Generative Realm. It gets more complex then that, but that will do for now. The Noetic Realm is the space of Platonic Ideals, like redness, circleness, and so on that are the perfect ideal of what they are. Above the Noetic exists The One, aka the Good, some call it God, but it's far beyond such a concept and largely to alien to fit that title. Ideas eminate downwards from the Noetic Realm to the Pyschic Realm, the realm of the Whole Soul and the World Soul. It's here where in MtG terms we would have the Aether. At each level from Noetic to the Generative the Gods exist. Now we know the emination of every form exists in the essense of the Aether, ready to be summoned forth by magic users. Now individuals like say the hero Giden or the God Bhontu exists as what are called particulars, individual manifestations of something, where as forms are called imuniversals, they exist beyond any particular example of themselves. Like Giden would be a Particular of the universal humaness or Planeswalkerness. But my interest in Modual Realism lead to counterpart theory, which suggests that each of us has counterparts in other universes, a counterpart for every possible universes. It was combining this philosophy with Neoplatonism that I realized that folks could be both particulars and universals. So let's use Bhontu as an example. At the highest Noetic there is Bhontuness, the quality that defines every example of Bhontu in all of existance in both space and time, a quality of which every counterpart (or magically created/summoned version) of Bhontu expresses. Down lower in the Psyhic Realm, the Aether in MtG, this is reflected in the emination of the forms called Logai. When a magic user summons Bhontu, they are functionally creating a counterpart Bhontu from the Logai with the Aether. This Bhontu God Counterpart takes on energy and matter, entering the realm of generation. This is why two different magic users could summon Bhontu, even though he died, became a Zombie God, and then died again. But if he died, what are they summoning? A copy of Bhontu yes, but how do you summon that if he no longer exists? You can summon this God, because the undying part of Bhontu, the truely immortal, undestructable higher soul of Bhontu still exists, this God can only have his lowest forms destroyed, for as ling as Bhontuness exists, it will imprint upon the Psychic World, aka the Aether, which can be drawn upon to create Bhontu anew. This also goes for mortal creatures. Take mortals in Innistrad, who if they don't become ghosts, end up getting dumped into the Aether to be "destroyed", but are they? These beings can be summoned back into the generative realm just like Bhontu can be, because while the generative manifestation of their lower soul disolves in the Aether, their Noetic Soul, their form, the Themness of which they are but an imperfect copy, still exists. So what individuals who believe that their souls fibd oblivion in the Aether doen't understand is that they have a higher soul that doesn't die, and in fact is completely indestructable and completely perfect, that still exists, that eminates into the Aether, and which can be used to remanufest them into the generative world, the world of matter and energy as we particulars experience it day to day. If folks can be summoned after their deaths/anniliations, it suggests a higher self that is beyond destruction, a greater soul, otherwise there would be nothing to summon. This is also shown in time travel, as if on some level the past didn't still exist on some level upon transforming from the present and becoming the past. You can visit something that doesn't exist. How can Bhontu and Eternal Bhontu still exist in the past for MtG time travellers to visit? Because Bhontuness still exists, so time travellers draw past versions of him from his Noetic Soul, the Form of Bhuntuness to experience past versions of Bhontu. All of this has raminifications. First off that idea that any creature or god or artifact is ever truely gone, even Gideon, is an illusionary, when you can summon him from the Aether, or at least a version of him. The fact that you can do this to Gods as well suggests what you are truely worshipping is simply a manifestation of the real God, and that by doing so, you worship their corresponding universal. They are never really ever gone. Next up a post exploration the possible ramifications of the deaths of a bunch of Amonket Gods on Ravnica, both on local regilous practices and metaphysically. And then later a Stoic exploration of MtG theology. And the theological implications of crossing MtG with D amp;D. And the implications of comparing Amonket Gods and Thero Gods, whose traits appear to be so different (hint it's the exploration of the Platonic Form of Godness).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pon Far and evolutionary value of Vulcan Lesbianism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-17 17:46:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>It occurs to me that on the surface it's very illogical to have Vulcan males only normally mate once every seven years, yet Vulcan females can mate any time or the all the time. What purpose does this huge difference in sexual appetite serve on an evolutionary level, why would female Vulcans be capable of sex for years and years of time while their male partner has to wait Seven years to satisfy them. What form does female Vulcan sexuality take in the huge gap of time? The only solution before warp would be lesbianism. Why evolve such major lesbian tendancies? Because Vulcans were so passionate and wild before their adoption of Stoic Logic that males got distracted and didn't help raise their young, but female Vulcan would pair off with each other to raise the offspring until the next pon far, then return to the relationship after mating with the male Vulcan was over, usually pregnant. Then Logic was discovered and Vulcan men got their passions under control and focused on being more responsible, deciding to act as fathers instead of sperm donors. This doesn't mean the end of Vulcan lesbianism, just an adjustment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What a Fucking Disaster</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-22 04:05:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Singh surge didn't happen, and we lost every seat in Quebec except for Boultrice and Maybe REB (it's still really close, she might win). We lost a seat to the Greens I think. And we got roughly 15%, unacceptable low. I think Jagmeet should resign as leader (but not as as an MP). Yes he did well during the debates, but that brought no benifits it appears. If we are going to turn this around, we need Quebec back, and Jagmeet can't do that and that means Boultrice or REB if she makes it has to become leader. If Jagmeet stays leader he will get a few consessions out of Trudeau, the public will give credit to that asshole instead of Jagmeet and he will win another majority in two to 4 years and the NDP will be in the single digits. We've seen Liberal PMs do this before to the NDP in minorities. Jagmeet Singh did great in this campaign and it achieved fuck all. Only Quebec progressively are immune to Liberal fear tactics about the Tories, which when it backs the NDP gives the NDP the chance to win enough support to look competitive enough to steal votes from the Liberals, making winning possible. And it takes a Quebecer to win in Quebec. Hence why we need a surviving Quebec MP, one of the possibly two most charismatic Quebec MPs to win the leadership of the NDP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Ruth Ellen Brusseau had one her seat, I'd say, REB, but she didn't although she was very close. That leaves Alexander Boultrice. There was a lot of talk at the last two leadership races for the NDP of Alexander Boultrice running for leader, but it didn't happen. Now is the time.</TEXT>
