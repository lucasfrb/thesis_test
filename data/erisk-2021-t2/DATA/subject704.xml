    <DATE>2020-02-19 02:12:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m so lost right now. Today I had to walk away from the people I thought cared about me. They broke a promise that was very important to me. I just can #8217;t deal with people lying and cheating me anymore. If I had a gun I know I #8217;d blow my brains out. Or I #8217;d shoot myself in the heart. The unselfish thing to do would be to take and aspirin and hang myself. That way my organs could be salvaged, and maybe I could save someone. I #8217;m alone. I #8217;m alone again; and I #8217;m sick and tired of being alone. Depression is dominating my mind and body. I #8217;m lucky I didn #8217;t get into a car crash today. I can #8217;t move my body in a normal fashion. I can barley talk. It needs to stop. The pain is so overwhelming. I feel so worn down and old. I don #8217;t even know why I #8217;m posting this here. What good will it even do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How Normal/Common are Suicidal Ideations</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-19 02:44:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m recently off my medications. I overdosed on them, and that ended the Sertraline/Lamotrogine combo that was helping me almost enough. Now I #8217;m back to my usual alternating cycle of one week high and one week almost dead. Is it normal to be having these constant suicidal fantasies. Anytime I get this way, the suicidal thoughts and plans come. Hell, I #8217;ve been researching the  #8220;exit-bag #8221; method tonight. Even have an amazon wishlist dedicated to the supplies. Please tell me that this is common. I always find myself wanting to die, and concocting a plan when I find myself going down or at rock bottom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I typically don #8217;t resort to suicidal thinking when bad things happen. Unless those bad things are absolutely all encompassing of every facet of my life. That #8217;s how I am personally. But I think the persistent presence of thought of plain old death, along with suicide, may be a form of a coping mechanism. It would seem as though I always have a plan when I get low. Even on medications. I appreciate your advice. But I will not have some doctor take away my freedom to cover his own ass. That #8217;ll result in homicidal thoughts which I do not want to return to having. But I think your response did give me some perspective and helped answer my question. Thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to rehab and stayed for 5 months. So I was under observation by the staff of the facility in a hands off way. When I was there I just let my emotions manifest themselves as they truly were. Personally, I never had considered Bipolar disorder. I had already been diagnosed with High Functioning Autism. Which is now referred to as ASD. But the doctor at the facility began to pickup on the fact that I seemed to go through alternating cycles of  #8216;happy #8217; and  #8216;upset #8217;. So he diagnosed me as bipolar and put me on a mood stabilizer. Which I am off of now. After being diagnosed, I became more cognizant of my shifting moods. Like last week. Monday of last week I was dangerously high. The rest of week I was rolling in mania. Just feeling great. Then Tuesday of this week came and I began to feel weak and apathetic. I #8217;m hoping the peak was last night where I literally wanted to die. So yeah. That was my journey. Hope it helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first thing I say is that you won #8217;t be able to make her understand what you are going through. Unless she has experienced it, she won #8217;t understand it. So I #8217;d advise not even bothering with that. Try explaining to her exactly what you have explained to us here. Don #8217;t direct blame toward her. Even if you think she #8217;s to blame. Take ownership for anything you can. I #8217;m a former Marine, taking ownership (Not Apologizing) is a huge thing in the military. Even if you don #8217;t think you should have to take any ownership of anything. There are things that you CAN take ownership of and that I can almost guarantee. If you decide to talk to her. Listen; not going about trying to pick holes in her points. Try to get a good grasp of her position. No matter how illogical it may seem. She can #8217;t understand what you #8217;re going through. But you can #8217;t understand her position either, unless you eventually have a child that is Bipolar which I hope you don #8217;t. That #8217;s what I #8217;ve been told to do in these situations by men/women far wiser than me many times in my life. And it has helped me personally. Hope that helps. Sending good vibes your way.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Suicide Better Than Relapse?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-06 01:57:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m in recovery from drug/alcohol addiction. Lately I #8217;ve been having strong thoughts of relapse. I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s because I #8217;m doing quite well lately. Not on the mental health side of things. But I #8217;ve just acquired employment. Doing the healthy living thing. Besides cigs. Exercise, good diet etc... Still. I can #8217;t escape these very intrusive fantasies. They were so strong that tonight they were causing physical symptoms. Pressure in the center of my head. I swore to myself that I #8217;d kill myself before relapsing. I won #8217;t go back to zero. I don #8217;t know if relapse is inevitable. But if it gets to that point. I don #8217;t see any other way. I have the money and the means to asphyxiate myself painlessly. I #8217;m quite confused. I don #8217;t know why I #8217;m posting this here. If you want to know how I feel listen the song  #8216;Jugband Blues #8217; by Pink Floyd. That #8217;s my song.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Constant Suicidal Thoughts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-10 00:19:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don #8217;t get it. I don #8217;t think I #8217;m depressed. At least not as depressed as I have been in the past. Still, I constantly have intrusive thoughts of suicide. Yesterday I went to 4 separate drug stores to buy enough cough medicine to overdose with. 120 pills in all. Then I had a conversation that got me out of my head and flushed them. Wasted $50! I often walk to the bridge down the street and smoke my  #8220;last cigarette #8221; but I always turn around. When I went to work the other day I just wanted to walk out before the shift started. Buy a realistic toy gun. Call the cops and tell them to shoot me. Then I got to work and got out of my head and things were ok. I really wish someone would shoot me or stab me and leave me to bleed out. Even when things are going ok. I still want to die. Just got out of 5 months of rehab. So I doubt the family will be keen on intensive mental health inpatient. Things seem like they should be going great. I have a job despite all the craziness. I have my own place, with roommates. But I still just really want to die! It doesn #8217;t make sense. Why won #8217;t these thoughts leave?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Criminal Acts Shouldn #8217;t Follow People</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-12 14:53:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the US, if you commit a crime you #8217;re pretty much done. You have a record that can decimate you for the remainder of your life. We have the class D felony. Nonviolent crimes that prevent you from functioning as a normal person for the rest of your life. Criminal records even prevent you from leaving the country in some instances. In a lot of states you lose essential features of citizenship. Past mistakes do not determine future behavior. We have no right to incapacitate people on the basis of a mistake they #8217;ve made in the past. Rather, we have an obligation to aid people in creating a better life for themselves. If you screw someone over how can you expect them to do better? It really makes no sense to me. The mentality of hurting people that do wrong is the mentality of a violent-vengeful-society. For the record, I have no criminal record so this does not pertain to me in any way personally. Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to and challenged my opinion! I definitely have more research to do on rehabilitation for criminals. I #8217;m actually happy that there were some points made I couldn #8217;t respond to immediately. It means I have work to do, and I #8217;ll either find evidence to back up my beliefs or they #8217;ll change. Peace!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-16 15:53:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I experience near constant mood swings. Sometimes it will be occurring throughout the day. Sometimes it #8217;ll be weeks of near catatonic depression. followed by a week of shaky mania, or more preferably a week of reprieve from instability involving relative normalcy. My former psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bioplar-2. I don #8217;t know if that is the case. My mood tends to cycle by the week or weeks. And, as I mentioned above, it sometimes cycles throughout the day. I literally quit my new job on the third day because I was physically incapacitated by the lowness. I felt suicidal, and I could barley move. I don #8217;t know what to do. I #8217;ve been considering inpatient therapy because I already have weekly sessions with a counselor. But this is becoming to much for me to handle. Any advice would be much appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nobody cares about mental illness in this country. I went to residential rehab for 5 months. But I can #8217;t find a good place for residential mental health treatment. They have an endless chain of residential drug rehab places. But nowhere good that I can find that #8217;s oriented toward mental health. I called a local university hospital today and I asked if they had a program that focused on recovery or stabilization. At least they were honest. Long term stabilization is the most they offer. What a bummer; I heard good things and had my fingers crossed. Just hoping that they might be able to help make things better. Nobody wants to make things better. Everybody just wants to make sure you #8217;re stable. Eventually you just end up lying about the bad thoughts because the conditions in the psych unit are so bad. You lie to get out and get no help. It #8217;s really disgusting. I don #8217;t know what to do anymore. I really just want to sleep and never wake up. We #8217;ll wait till I get the courage to end it all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s kind of glorifying mental illness right? I mean cool art and all. But really? There is no best part of being bipolar. It #8217;s not an edgy or exclusive thing. Bipolar, and all mental disorders, is an illness that can be fatal without treatment. Again, cool art. But glorifying a mental disorder isn #8217;t cool. Thinking that I #8217;d lose my creative edge is what kept me from trying medication. But that edge isn #8217;t a benefit to me if I #8217;m dead.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Playing With Suicide</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-13 03:16:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I constantly have the desire to die. Wether it be suicide or being killed. Personally I #8217;d prefer being killed. Something like charging directly into gunfire would be wonderful. But I really like to play with suicide. Almost act out the way I #8217;d do it. I like to walk to the bridge about a mile away from where I live. It rests 60 feet above the Mississippi. I #8217;ll go to the center and smoke a cig. Contemplating death, and how it would feel to drown in that murky swift current. I #8217;d like to think that if I completely surrendered to it. That it #8217;d be a relatively pleasant experience. Then there #8217;s the ligatures. I tie my belt around the pull-up bar I have in my door frame. And I try to rest against the belt in a way that constricts the blood flow rather than the airway. Today I started to get light headed and tingly after just a few seconds. It was actually fantastic. I felt all warm and tingly when I stood up for whatever reason. I sometimes wonder what #8217;d happen if I just gave in. But I #8217;m scared by the thought of my roommates finding me. There #8217;s several other ways that I play with suicide. If that #8217;s the right way of putting it. When I tell people this it scares them. If I told my counselor she #8217;d want me to go to the hospital. She #8217;d probably tell me to go to the hospital or else she #8217;d call in a welfare check. I wish people understood why I do this type of thing. And I wish I understood why I do this type of thing. It #8217;s scared people before. It #8217;s gotten me into facilities before. But it #8217;s all just confusing to me personally. And that #8217;s about all I have to say about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not exactly sure what point you #8217;re trying to make here. It #8217;s not that I #8217;m trying to be a dick. But the title and the content of the actual post aren #8217;t very coherent or linked. If someone drives drunk/high and gets caught they should be charged with attempted murder? That #8217;s what the title to your post is saying. And that #8217;s absolutely ludicrous. If they get caught driving while intoxicated then they should be dealt with on situation by situation basis. Officers and judges have discretion and refuse to use it in a lot of these situations. They refuse to use it because being hardline on certain issues gets them votes and cash. We should be taking into account possible issues of dependence for certain offenders. And the actual degree of intoxication. Tolerance is also something we should probably be looking at. But that #8217;s my unpopular opinion regarding drunk driving laws. If someone kills someone with a vehicle while drunk/high should they be charged by murder? In some cases yes, and in other cases no. This type of stuff isn #8217;t cut and dry. If you can prove negligence or malice on the part of the offender. Then yeah. That #8217;s a murder. Right? Also, using your logic. The whole  #8216;they knew what they were doing #8217; thing. Shouldn #8217;t any car crash involving fatalities involve murder charges? If you don #8217;t know the danger of getting into a metal projectile and slingshotting yourself down an asphalt death-track. Then you probably shouldn #8217;t be driving. Oh also. Why don #8217;t you actually look into the penalties? Have you? I don #8217;t know what state you #8217;re in. But losing the ability to drive unless you pay hefty fines, having to install an interlock device and possibly picking up a felony on your permanent record. Along with all the possible jail time even for a first offense. Those are permanent life altering consequences. In my opinion there #8217;s not enough nuance in the court room/squad car when it comes to these issues.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-14 04:29:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I looked at my post history and saw that I #8217;ve posted here 6 times in the last 3 months. I #8217;ve been committed twice in the period. The first time was after an actual overdose of my medications. It #8217;s funny. I don #8217;t know why I post here. Maybe I just want someone to know how fucked up my brain is. I won #8217;t tell the people I #8217;m closest with. The person I #8217;d say I #8217;m most fond of is already going through enough. How would she feel if I told her that I never stop thinking of dying? I can #8217;t stop thinking of dying. There #8217;s no end to it. Fantasizing about going out with glory is my favorite pass time. Walking to the bridge, playing with ligatures and knives is one of the more comforting things in my life. What #8217;s wrong with me? I #8217;m not even in a state of absolute misery. Four or five months ago I was so depressed that I stopped eating, and tried to stop drinking fluids. I #8217;m not like that anymore. But I still want to go into that sweet-deep-sleep. Asking for help is terrifying. Even though it won #8217;t cost anything to get it. My deductible is already gone for the year after the two hospitalizations. Still, I really don #8217;t want to put myself on hold anymore. Which is funny because I don #8217;t want to be here much longer. When I think of the future I #8217;m filled with dread. Even when I try to fantasize about a wife and kids. A career and a home. Reading, writing and living. It #8217;s all so overwhelming. I wish I could just have the warriors death I #8217;ve always wanted. Why do the mass shooters always avoid the places I #8217;m at? Give me someone to rush. That #8217;d be the best thing for me. I #8217;d see how many bullets it #8217;d take to get me down. If I couldn #8217;t walk anymore then I #8217;d crawl to my death. And if I couldn #8217;t crawl. Then I #8217;d taunt the bastard until he executes me. It #8217;d be so wonderful. At the park tonight I saw a nice tree that I #8217;d like to die under. Maybe that ritual Japanese suicide. Take my hunting knife and stab myself deeply in the abdomen. Drag it from the right to the left. Sever my abdominal aorta. Fade away in the middle of the outstanding tree. When I was sitting on a park bench smoking. I just kept feeling my pulse on my wrist. Imagining taking my hunting knife and tearing into the artery. What #8217;s the point of the post? Am I begging for help or just venting? Does this mindset even count as suicidal anymore? Probably not. It #8217;s just my baseline. A constant drag, and I don #8217;t even know if I want it to get better. Maybe I do. But it #8217;s just so much. This really is so strange. I #8217;m sorry. I feel like this post, and all of my posts really, is just a waste of time and energy on the readers part. I #8217;ll keep trudging along until I get the courage to cut myself open or throw myself over the edge and into the river.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s because we #8217;re not doing everything we have to in recovery. Recovering from an addiction to ANYTHING is more than just not doing the behavior. It #8217;s more than not drinking, getting high, binge eating, starving, gambling, smoking or being promiscuous. It #8217;s a life style change. Your best way of living before led you into addiction. So how could anybody expect for things to change if they exclusively get sober? I #8217;ve been in recovery from drug addiction and alcoholism since August last year. Had 1 slip up so my clean time isn #8217;t what I #8217;d like it to be. But I #8217;ve noticed that when I get lazy and stop doing the things that are good for me. Such as reading, calisthenic strength training, running, yoga, proper sleep hygiene and eating a healthy/consistent diet. I being to go back to maladaptive behaviors. For me it #8217;s cutting and burning myself. That #8217;s just my two cents. I #8217;m not an professional. It #8217;s just my experience. When I stop doing what the good stuff in my recovery. I feel bad. And because I don #8217;t have my old outlet and feel that I can #8217;t return to it. I go to other ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He #8217;s not an ex-addict. He is an addict in recovery. Just like me. And that can be a scary thing to deal with. It #8217;s scary for me having almost all of my friends be in recovery. Because I know that if they slip up the consequences can be dire. In my opinion (for true addicts) we do not love our drugs. We depend on our drugs to feel ok at the beginning, middle and end of the day. According to the disease model of addiction. Drugs to an addict become as important as food, water and sex. And that has been my experience. I don #8217;t know what else to say. I truly wish people viewed addicts with more empathy. Not excusing the bad things we have done. But understanding that we literally have a disease. And like any disease it does not have to define us. If given the proper medicine one can triumph over most diseases. And then the potential in them can manifest. They can be the loving husband/wife, father/mother, friend and employee/employer that they were always meant to be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that recognizing the disease model of addiction would be a start. Maybe trying a compassionate approach. Not excusing criminal acts committed by addicts/alcoholics. But understanding that the underlying cause is a treatable illness. And then making an effort to provide effective treatment. There #8217;s a program where I live that #8217;s court ordered sometimes. It #8217;s run by the Salvation Army. I think it #8217;s a minimum 8 month program. Similar to a jail sentence in duration, but unlike jail you can #8217;t get drugs. You work for the Salvation Army while you #8217;re there and attend AA meetings and groups. I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s true that people can #8217;t recover unless they want to. When I went to rehab it was more or less on a whim. I didn #8217;t know what I wanted or what was going to happen. But being in a place where I could be sober for 5 months and become what I #8217;d been hiding for years changed me. Maybe instead of lengthy jail/prison sentences we should have mandatory long term treatment. None of that 30 day bogus. And that 30 day stuff is bogus. It #8217;s what insurance companies use to shorten stays. Based on some BS research that said it takes 28 days to change a habit. Also. The felony status of repeat drug offenders and DUI/OWI offenders seems a bit problematic to me. You relegate people who have negative coping strategies to a permanently lower stratum in our society. You can #8217;t get a job, you can lose licenses, and you can be denied access to an apartment. How is anybody supposed to recover when they can #8217;t even get along. Of course felony status is justifiable for certain offenders. But judges and prosecutors refuse to use discretion when dealing out punishment. Because we live in a society that values harshness. I dunno. Some of my ideas about reforming the criminal justice aspect of addiction may seem a bit fringe. Maybe I #8217;m just a bit to forgiving. Who knows. Anyway, that #8217;s my answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like we just need people who use discretion and take into account life experience. Now of course there are situations where this isn #8217;t possible. Vehicular homicide while inebriated isn #8217;t something we can brush off. Neither is breaking and entering, robbery, battery, assault, etc... Still. This won #8217;t be possible if the societal attitudes don #8217;t change. We need to become familiar with reality again. And we haven #8217;t been for a long time. I #8217;d like to see ads on TV that evoke an emotional response that isn #8217;t anger. No more of this we #8217;re-gonna-get-you stuff. It just doesn #8217;t work. Especially with sick people. And also. Most rehabs are 28 days. The place I went to had a full program lasting 90 days. I stayed 150 days. For some people it takes a long time to break down the walls they build up. Me personally. I had an entire persona oriented around my behaviors while using drugs and drinking. It took me 60 days to trust and open up to my counselor. Who I saw in half the daily groups and for 2 individual sessions a week. The point I #8217;m trying to make is that major work takes time. We use the 28 day model because it is viable for insurance. Some study said it takes 28 days to break a habit. But according to the literature. Addiction isn #8217;t a habit. It is a bio-psycho-social disease.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You stop doing the things you need to do. Recovery isn #8217;t just removing a substance/behavior from your life. It #8217;s changing the way you live because your old life style got you addicted to substances/behaviors. Sometimes it gets really difficult to do the things you know you have to. Life doesn #8217;t just stop being life because you #8217;re in recovery. Sometimes you #8217;ll be apathetic, depressed, anxious or whatever else you can think of. When those times come. It becomes really easy to let the little things that you once prized in recovery go by the wayside. For me. When I had my relapse that I recently escaped. I screwed myself over. I #8217;ve struggled with mental health issues for years. And I knew when I got out of rehab that I couldn #8217;t submit to my proclivity toward apathy. But I did just that. In the midst of a deep depression I ditched all the good things I #8217;d been doing. Stopped working out, eating healthy, reading, going for walks and I stopped going to AA. Then I tried to treat the depression with psychedelics. After that I went back to my drug of choice for roughly a week. It all came down to me not doing the things that I know I need to do. Is it my fault I became depressed? Not really. Is it my fault I entered a state of self-loathing? Absolutely. Sorry for the lengthy response. But I honestly think that it all boils down to the little things addicts do or don #8217;t do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are a lot of things in school that induce anxiety for people. Just like in the workforce after school. Plenty of things are quite uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. It #8217;s absolutely ludicrous to just give people a pass because it #8217;s difficult for them. I #8217;d be all for building confidence. Maybe presentations should start in a divided class in the 6th grade and be the full class by 8th grade. You tend to do better when you build up your strength. Still for me it #8217;s just a big no. You don #8217;t get a pass because you #8217;re uncomfortable. Even if it #8217;s an anxiety disorder. What you should get is coaching and support. In my own life I wasn #8217;t given the support that most people with ASD are given. Because I wasn #8217;t diagnosed until 16 despite years of teachers and parents saying there was something different about me. But I don #8217;t think I #8217;d be doing as well now without that adversity and the necessity to overcome it. Not that I #8217;m doing fantastic now, my post history is evidence of that. But I still manage to function quite well in the workforce and socially. And I don #8217;t know if I would be without those challenging experiences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me personally I had to go to rehab. And I was there for a long time. The personality I concocted while in my addiction was harder to let go of than the drugs. I think outside help is essential for any addiction. And a willingness to stick with that outside help for a long period of time. Wether it be going to a 12 step meeting, going to rehab, seeing a counselor or doing outpatient program. That outside help and the willingness to stay around even during setbacks is important.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean it #8217;s all in the title. Hospitals shouldn #8217;t be allowed to hold people against their will because they believe they are a danger to themselves. If you #8217;re a danger to somebody else then that #8217;s a different story. And if you #8217;re undeniably in a psychotic state and dangerous to yourself then there may be some justification. But at the end of the day I firmly believe that human beings have the right to end themselves. It #8217;s not always irrational to want to die. Yes things can get better. But I honestly think a system of forced hospitalization for the suicidal but otherwise same individual is more detrimental than helpful to society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suffering is not temporary. It is a constant in life. Hunger is suffering and most of us experience it everyday. The degree to which you suffer changes over time. But at the end of the day to live is to suffer. And if one can not find an actual purpose or meaning behind their suffering. It #8217;d be infinitely more irrational to live in a state of ups and downs rather than to end the cycle suffering and reprieve. That #8217;s a valid position to hold in my opinion. If somebody wants to take control of their plunge into oblivion. I say that it #8217;s their right to do so. You #8217;re going to end up there one way or another. And what right does anybody have to say you can #8217;t go when you want to?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suffering is undergoing pain, distress or hardship. You can #8217;t really separate pain from suffering. Suffering is the conscious experience of pain or inconvenience. If you make meaning in your life. In a sense you have found meaning in your life. The process of making anything is seeking/searching for a desirable end result. And at the end of the day. My point still stands that if I am comfortable with death and the ramifications of death. Then it is my choice as to wether or not I shall continue to live. Everybody always likes to say things can get better. They never acknowledge that things can also get worse. It #8217;s a draw between things getting worse and getting better. 50/50. It #8217;s not irrational to guess either heads or tails in a coin toss because it may be the side opposite your guess. Also, I #8217;m not pro-suicide. I just think it #8217;s more harmful than helpful to hold people in psychiatric facilities or hospital rooms because you #8217;re worried they may harm themselves. If that #8217;s the case we should also be holding every drug user, tobacco smoker and alcohol drinker in psychiatric facilities. With the widespread availability of information regarding the aforementioned substances. There #8217;s no chance that they don #8217;t know that they #8217;re poisoning themselves and setting themselves up for pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suicide doesn #8217;t require the assumption that it is only going to continue to get worse. It may be the result of one growing tired of the simple possibility of additional misery. Some people may just be sick of the ups and downs of life. Of the inevitability of return to misery. The definition of suffering is literally the state of undergoing pain, distress, or hardship. You can #8217;t separate pain and suffering. However you can certainly respond to suffering in many ways. But you can #8217;t separate it. The pain I feel from exercise causes me to suffer. But I take it in stride because I can see a positive result from it. And I didn #8217;t use the word irrational. I said if someone is in an undeniably psychotic state. Just because you can #8217;t see any rationale in suicide doesn #8217;t men somebody else can #8217;t. And it #8217;s completely a matter of the individuals personal beliefs. At the end of the day you can #8217;t make me live if I don #8217;t want to. Most people are perfectly fine watching people drink and drug themselves to death over the course of years. But if someone tries to take care of it in a night then that person becomes less than a person in the eyes of the law.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been doing a lot of thinking lately. It #8217;s all pointless. Living is more irrational than killing yourself. It #8217;s not a Permanent solution to a Temporary problem. Life is invariably occupied with different degrees of suffering. It all inevitably leads to death anyway. How is it rational to continue to suffer out of spite? There #8217;s no way that it can actually be rational to continue to experience suffering when there #8217;s a way out. I hate it. I truly despise it. Months ago I had a feeling that there was purpose and goodness to be had. But now I know it #8217;s all a sham. I #8217;m giving myself 24 hours to stay around. Try my best to enjoy myself. Smoke cigarettes. Send loving texts to friends. Make the day as painless as is possible. That #8217;s the way to go. I #8217;ve posted here so many times and I haven #8217;t even got a clue why. Nobody can help me really. I #8217;m a lost cause. Tomorrow by midnight I #8217;ll have hung myself with my belt from the pull-up bar in my doorway. For those of you who want to tell me how bad it #8217;ll hurt. It won #8217;t. That #8217;s not how it works. Only if you exclusively constrict the airway do you experience agony and panic. I #8217;ll pad the belt, constrict the veins/arteries and kneel. Within in seconds I #8217;ll be drowned in warm tingly darkness. Then oblivion. Why am I even posting this here? Why am I always posting posting here?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Lovely Demon In My Basement</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-22 17:32:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last night I had a strange dream. It #8217;s one of the most vivid and peculiar dreams that I #8217;ve had since I stopped abusing drugs some time ago. It took place in my childhood home. Situated in the Midwestern region of America. Outside of a very large and (in)famous city. From what I can recall; I was the same person/age/build that I am currently. I was walking down the stairs to my basement when I felt compelled to go to the closet that held the water boiler. It seemed like the thing to do for some reason. When I arrived, the closet door was open, and there was a woman chained to the boiler. Her hands were stuck behind her back and she was leaning forward. The chains were long, connecting somewhere behind the boiler. The light produced by the bulb in the closet gave me a bad feeling. It was a dim orange hue that you #8217;d typically see from an extremely old bulb. Still I felt compelled to look at the woman. I believe I instantly could tell she was evil. My actual thought in the dream was that she was a demon. Her head was buzzed clean, her eyes dark and her a lips sort of violet. Her lips were what I noticed. They were so full and enticing. Despite the overwhelming feeling that she was a literal demon. I felt compelled by her stare to kiss her. So I did, and we began to make out like wild beasts. I don #8217;t know how long this lasted. But at some point I felt compelled to leave. She was amused by this. When I returned she wasn #8217;t there. I woke up shortly afterwards. I have no idea what to make of this dream. But it was such a powerful, vivid and intoxicating dream that I can #8217;t help but continue to think about it. If anybody has an interpretation or opinion I #8217;d love to hear it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t answer your question because my longest period of sobriety was just over 9 months. And I had a relapse that I escaped only 5 days ago. However I feel obligated to point out that the symptoms of Post Acute Withdrawal often make people think they #8217;re brain damaged. I was addicted to deliriant drugs. Those are basically just poison to your brain. Immediately after coming off them I did feel brain damaged. But over those 9 months I realized that my intelligence and cognitive abilities hadn #8217;t really been affected. At least not to a noticeable or incapacitating extent . Sorry to intrude on your post. But I just felt like pointing that out. It may not be brain damage. And even if it is neuro plasticity is an amazing thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or the ER. I had planned to go to my home group for my 6 month. Then commit suicide, because I had lost a lot and was consequently suicidal. And although my home group was a decent reprieve for an hour. I literally took the overdose of psychotropic medicine in the bathroom in the meeting. If someone is legitimately irrationally-suicidal. Then the magic of AA/NA/SR is probably not enough. Just providing my anecdote as some evidence to that. If someone is suicidal, they need to consult with their counselor or an ER doc.</TEXT>

So, every job I #8217;ve had I worked hard at. But I never yielded any satisfaction. The only thing I wish to do is walk, and meditate. I yearn for spiritual pilgrimage. My Mom says I #8217;m lazy, and that I just don #8217;t want to grow up. I don #8217;t take to kindly to that. I #8217;m a veteran, and I #8217;ve never said no to work. There #8217;s something that compels me to walk, and ponder. But it just seems so impossible. I don #8217;t know how I can live this life. There #8217;s no place here for me. Nobody will accept it. I don #8217;t want to make millions, or party, or fuck like a maniac. I just want to find something. And there #8217;s no way to do it.</TEXT>

Especially when there #8217;s a chemical imbalance involved. Still, there is a way to deal with knowing things most people do not. I like to look around and laugh. Because it really is all so ridiculous when you think about it. Here we are on a rock in space spinning around a massive nuclear fusion reactor. Everything that is eventually will not be. Everyone gets sick, gets old, and eventually dies. And there #8217;s noting that I can actually find wrong with any of that. Why would there be anything wrong with anything in the grand scheme of things? The world used to get more depressing the more I read and payed attention to the news. But for some reason, and I think that reason is my independent studies of mindfulness and eastern philosophy. That really isn #8217;t the case anymore. But that #8217;s just my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wholeheartedly agree that we shouldn #8217;t excuse shitty behavior. Personally I don #8217;t believe in excuses for anything. I do believe that we should try to explain things though. In finding an explanation for a behavior we better understand how to curtail that behavioral pattern. When I say something like  #8220;maybe they have trauma #8221;. It is because I #8217;m going with the assumption that the individual isn #8217;t operating at full capacity. That may be wrong in some circumstances of course. Saying that isn #8217;t me excusing the behavior. It #8217;s my way of rationalizing it so that it doesn #8217;t affect me personally. In my background there #8217;s a lot of trauma. And my response to the trauma was to attempt to kill the person I am. At age 13 after the culminating event of a parents constant drinking and raging. I decided it #8217;d be better to be devoid of emotion, and ignore feeling of empathy towards others. And for 7 years I did a good job of that. I was quite a terrible person. There #8217;s no way to excuse my misdeeds. And my peers and various counselors didn #8217;t try to excuse it. They tried to explain it, and fix it. Luckily it eventually worked. Sorry for the personal anecdote; I don #8217;t if it #8217;s necessary but it felt relevant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Initially the acquisition of knowledge and the restructuring of your belief system is painful! Just like physical exercise. There is agony involved, but eventually you will reap the rewards. The idea that intelligence and depression are inextricably tied together. It #8217;s simply the way brilliant people have tried rationalize their sick state of mind. And I say that sympathetically. For years I thought that intelligence was a curse. I thought it was my ability to see things differently. My thirst for knowledge. That led to my feelings of contempt for existence. But it wasn #8217;t! I was very ill, and I still struggle sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It may be best for you to stop drinking altogether. Just a test run. To see if you have the undeniable urge. And if that #8217;s the case. Then maybe some counseling and support groups would be best. I can #8217;t tell you if you have a problem for certain. But what you are describing sounds like the start of something bad. Only you can decide if you have a problem. And based on the way you wrote your post. It sounds like your urges and lack of control when drinking is scaring you. Usually when I ask questions like this. I already know the answer. I just want somebody to say it to me. Not trying to sound snide by saying that. Take care.</TEXT>

For a while it was quite difficult. All this suffering, and unjust pain. It made me hurt. Both physically and psychologically. Then I realized that I couldn #8217;t quite figure out what was wrong with any of it. If that makes sense. Even in regard to the most horrendous crimes. When you look at the big picture. Is there anything wrong with any of it? I #8217;m not saying anyone should adopt an attitude of complacency or inaction. I still take action when I feel it is justified. But that deep pain isn #8217;t a part of my life anymore. Because I know in the back of my mind that it really is  #8216;Okay #8217;. Whatever that means. It #8217;s one of those things that you butcher when you try to put it into words.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anger is something I feel in my entire torso. I don #8217;t fully flex, but I tense all the muscles in my upper body. And I can definitely feel pressure in my chest and stomach. Frustration is similar to anger without muscle tension. It #8217;s something I feel more in my gut and chest. Not a twisting feeling, more like a pressure. Anxiousness is chest and stomach but it #8217;s a twisting and cold clenching of those areas. Peaceful is something that I don #8217;t really feel. Joyful is something I feel in my head. In the very center of my head. Tension and borderline tingly. Proud is just full body relaxation. Take into account that these are all the extremes of the emotions you listed.

    <TEXT>I agree with you to a certain extent. Too much empathy can be debilitating. When someone prioritizes the well-being of others and fails to take care of themselves. That can only lead to disaster for the empathetic individual. We all need to prioritize ourselves. Someone who #8217;s in bad shape is in no position to be helping others out. However I detest the  #8220;mind your own business #8221; mentality in general. That #8217;s not western individualism. Not really. It #8217;s just selfishness.

Second of all there is no belief in suffering. Look up the definition of suffering. Suffering is the experience of pain. The experience that follows disappointment, injury and the like. If you are conscious and experience pain. Suffering entails. Third. And this is more in reference to my understanding of Buddhism. Particularly Zen Buddhism. Of which I claim to be no expert. It #8217;s not really about escaping suffering so much as excepting it. Accepting that suffering is a feature of life that you can #8217;t escape or deny. Then moving forward with that in mind.

    <TEXT>I think it all depends on context. If you #8217;re calling your roommate a hero for getting pizza. I think it #8217;s safe to assume you #8217;re joking around and having fun with the word. For me the word isn #8217;t devalued by overuse. I don #8217;t know the definition of hero verbatim. But I have a general idea of what it means. And knowing what it means makes it kind of annoying to hear it misused. Not all essential workers are heroes, not every public servant is a hero, etc... Hopefully that makes sense. I #8217;m a bit out of it. So I don #8217;t know if it does. How heroic of me to stand up for what I believe in when I #8217;m tired!</TEXT>

I really don #8217;t know how to articulate my fear of human experimentation properly. Call it a gut feeling that I try to rationalize. Regarding the death penalty. Hopefully we wake up and treat humans who have made terrible mistakes like human beings. Then I #8217;d be all for abolishing the death penalty. Life imprisonment would be something I support. But if that doesn #8217;t happen. With all the advancements in technology. We shouldn #8217;t have a case in this decade that is a wrongful conviction. The state of surveillance, tracking, and DNA.

    <TEXT>I absolutely agree that the prison system in my country (America) is vile. Still, adding to that via human experimentation just seems worse to me. I can see how there #8217;d be a potential for expanding the application of capital punishment. Again I #8217;d like to emphasize the fact that I #8217;m in favor of improving conditions within prisons. And reducing the penalty to life imprisonment. Which isn #8217;t something I #8217;m fond of personally. But it seems like the best direction to go in. My ideal capital punishment system would be targeting offenders that can #8217;t get better. Wether it be that their crime was so heinous, or they #8217;re determined to be psychopathic. I am pro reform. But in my opinion there are people beyond reform. In my perfect criminal justice system. We #8217;d scan the brains of high level offenders. There #8217;s a lot of evidence that psychopaths have structural brain differences. If it #8217;s determined that a high level offender is physically psychopathic. Then I think we have an obligation to do away with them. They #8217;ll never have the capacity to regret what they #8217;ve done. Or become fully functional human beings cognitively. People like Ted Bundy, and John Wayne Gacy. I think they needed to go. For most people I think life imprisonment is a terrible and unnecessary thing. We #8217;d be much better off educating and supporting them. Nurturing the better side of offenders. With the hope of making them into a productive member of society. You got me when it comes to evidence planting and foul play by the police force. I suppose that I should #8217;ve taken that into account. Hopefully with all the evidence mounting that police have stoped being public servants, and instead become public enemies. (Which is justified.) Hopefully we #8217;ll see reform, and do away with corruption sooner than later. It is possible. But it #8217;ll take a lot of work. Sorry if this is incoherent. Just woke up. Was up until 6am my time. So I had to crash till 1. Cheers!</TEXT>

It can be mesmerizing if you #8217;re in the right mood. But personally I wouldn #8217;t pay a bunch of money to live on the ocean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know about the incarcerated. But I find it disgusting that we do away with basic rights after a felony conviction. So many felony offenses are nonviolent. Why do these people deserve to be pushed down for the remainder of their lives? Also. Most people are felony level offenders without convictions. Most people don #8217;t report their tips to the IRS. Most people have driven drunk or high more than three times. Plenty of people have gotten into fights. Most people act criminally and don #8217;t get caught or reported to the authorities. That #8217;s because we have so many ridiculous laws on the book. And nobody really cares. So I don #8217;t accept the hard on crime or deterrence argument from anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s multiple definitions of the word survivor. Which is why it #8217;s a appropriate to use it for survivors of sexual assaults. Here #8217;s one example from dictionary.com:  #8220;a person who continues to function or prosper in spite of opposition, hardship, or setbacks. #8221; If that is one of ways the word survivor can be used. Then I see no reason not to call sexual assault victims survivors. It impacts people differently than other crimes. A lot of people who survive a sexual assault live with PTSD and other mental illnesses. If you #8217;re assaulted as a child it can alter your perception of sex and sexuality. By definition, if they are continuing to live their lives they are surviving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well. That #8217;s definitely not what I #8217;m experiencing. Maybe the  #8216;switch #8217; I #8217;ve mentioned is intrusive. Because it #8217;s like a force that comes over me. It #8217;s strange, almost like a whole different person is in the room.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. I don #8217;t leave to make room for someone else. The best way to describe it is a subtle albeit substantial shift in my energy. When the  #8216;switch #8217; is flipped I #8217;m prone to say things that I normally wouldn #8217;t say. Make gestures that I normally wouldn #8217;t. For some reason I feel detached from my humanity. Not in an animalistic way. But I know that when that  #8216;switch #8217; flips. I can do anything that I want. Not without legal repercussions of course. But I can do anything and feel nothing. One of my friends asked me what happens when the  #8216;switch #8217; flips. Because it had happened to flip that night and he was concerned. I looked at him. My face was blank and expressionless, and I said this:  #8220;You know right now you might as well be a chair. I could crush you and feel as though all I did was destroy an old piece of furniture. That #8217;s all people are when I #8217;m like this. People are just furniture. People are just objects. #8221; Surprisingly we #8217;re still good friends. The side of me most people see has only garnered praise in my experience. It #8217;s actually kind of funny. A lot of the people I #8217;ve befriended across the Midwest have told me I #8217;m the most caring and empathetic person they know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don #8217;t need to use 7 bullets. And smacking him in the back of his head with a pistol probably would #8217;ve dropped him. I can understand why the police needed to use force in this instance. This wasn #8217;t a situation where de-escalation would be effective. What bothers me is the manner in which the police dealt with him. But I understand that he needed to be dealt with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s definitely not stupid. But it #8217;s also not a cure-all for everybody. I think a lot of NoFap people that are vocal about it act like it #8217;s a cure for cancer. It just isn #8217;t. I don #8217;t have a problem occasionally viewing porn and enjoying jerking off. If you do, then NoFap is probably for you. Same thing goes with AA or NA. If you have a drinking/drug problem. Then those programs will be a cure-all for your issues. If not, then it #8217;s just kind of stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The violence that you have to visualize when you read. It #8217;s constructed through what you have at your disposal in your conscious and subconscious mind. Your own experience is the limit when it comes to violence on the page. Violence in movies leaves nothing to the imagination. Often times you #8217;ll go places you #8217;ve never been. And you #8217;re left to process that experience. Violence in video games is similar, but I think it #8217;s more intimate because of the control you have. When you #8217;re able to actually take part in the violence on screen. I think no matter how grounded you are in reality it affects you. Definitely differently than movies or books.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t believe that #8217;s your experience. Not for one second. I don #8217;t believe that somebody who write as coherently as you clearly can. Experiences fear of the unknown when reading about something they #8217;re not familiar with. I #8217;m sorry, but that is simply ludicrous to me. The profound experience that is fear of the unknown. Comes from your inability to understand what is written on a stack of small papers in your hand. Not buying that at all. I don #8217;t care how aloof or introspective you are. If you can #8217;t understand the violence written in a book you #8217;ll probably just be confused by it and move on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I typically don #8217;t encounter people that legitimately enjoy thinking. Especially on Reddit or other social media. That #8217;s honestly why I thought you were lying. You can tell somebody isn #8217;t an idiot when they write with a certain amount of eloquence. But you can #8217;t tell wether or not they #8217;re being disingenuous or pompous. Until you see a wall of text where they lay out all their cards for you to see. So I apologize for assuming you were lying. Thank you for being cordial with me despite that assumption.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Failed Marine. I #8217;m a disgrace.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 19:36:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>(This is a VERY long post. There is a TL;dr at the bottom. It is about a paragraph.) I enlisted in the Marine Corps when I was 17. The first thing I told the recruiters was that I was a high functioning Autistic individual. The second thing was that I #8217;d struggled with Alcoholism and drug Addiction. I didn #8217;t say drug use or drinking. Addiction and Alcoholism were the words I used. The third thing I revealed to them were scars from self injury. Before MEPS I #8217;d meet my recruiters wife. Because she taught me how to use makeup to cover the scars. Following these statements they had a private conference for 5 minutes. They determined that if I was willing to lie they would help me out. Naturally I agreed. These guys were decorated Marines, and if they gave me an order I was going to follow it. My parents made a deal with me. If I competed a season of wrestling then they #8217;d sign the contract. They wanted to see if I was capable of any form of commitment. I had no skills in wrestling. But I was doing pull-ups, knuckle-pushups and running daily. It was fairly easy for me to muscle the hell out of high school Juniors. So I had some fun. Got a skin disease that I still have scar tissue from. My forehead was torn open for the first month, and the skin on my knees is intensely scarred. But it was worth it. My contract was signed, and I was excited to have an opportunity to become a Marine. I would say that I was a quality Marine for the duration of Boot Camp and SOI. My DI #8217;s didn #8217;t know my name until third phase. I managed to make it out of boot camp without a lot of trouble. SOI was great because unlike most of Alpha Company I could actually hike. Which was probably the reason they let me into Machinegunners course. I became an 0331 Infantry Machinegunner. I had already earned the title. Now I had my dream job. I was gonna be like Animal Mother without the racism. Well that #8217;s what I thought anyway. Eventually I ended up being stationed in a well known base in the vicinity of the Mojave Desert. My unit was once home to some of the most adored and decorated Marines in the history of the Corps. Naturally I was extremely nervous, but also very excited. This was going to be a challenge. No doubt about that. But I had faith in my fellow junior enlisted Marines, and to a certain degree I had faith in my self. Sadly by the time I #8217;d gotten there I #8217;d already slipped back into old habits. When I was a civilian I #8217;d chronically abused cough and allergy medicine. It was easily accessible, and being an awkward autist I could never manage to find a plug. At SOI, for reasons I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll ever know, I returned to these habits. Every weekend I #8217;d be disassociated or delirious. Sometimes I was even messed up on fire watch. During delirious blackouts I did a lot of crazy things. Which I always claimed were the result of sleepwalking. One time I even tried to jump out of a window. But nobody reported me or any of my conduct. When I got to my unit I continued these habits for weeks. Eventually I realized that being in a position where I #8217;d literally be shooting live rounds over my friends heads. I was either going to fix myself, or kill another Marine. So I decided to seek help from my command. They got me the help. It took 4 weeks for me to get back to my unit. It must #8217;ve looked ridiculous. He #8217;s there for a month, and then he #8217;s gone for a month. They got me the help, but then they took it even further. I was supposed to be discharged following all of this craziness. But my SSgt asked if he could hold onto me. After everything else happened he told me this. That #8217;s probably the hardest thing for me. Someone laid down on barbed wire for me. And I failed them in an extraordinarily selfish manner. After I #8217;d gotten my help. I was pretty good for a while. PT was terrible, and by that I mean I sucked at it. Machinegunner PT is hellish no matter what unit you #8217;re in. And I was not in shape for it. So I frapped out numerous times. Which is bad enough, but eventually I decide to take the shit-baggery up a notch. I returned to my old habits. The decision wasn #8217;t a conscious one. At a certain point I just realized that I was high. And that would continue for months. For months my mental health noticeably deteriorated. I became less disciplined, and consequently my physical health deteriorated. It was like I was a walking corpse. Everyone in my peer group knew what was happening. They resented me, and some of them hated me. But none of the them went out of their way to harm me. I think all of them went out of their way to try and help me. They didn #8217;t want to be down a gunner, and I don #8217;t think they wanted to see another Marine fail. But of course, me being me, I pushed everyone away and sank into oblivion. Eventually it all came to a head. I had taken my allergy pills earlier on some Saturday. Probably in late July of 2018. But I had 60 cough pills left. Which wouldn #8217;t have been a substantial dose. However my liver was already screaming from the allergy meds. Those 60 pills would be made more potent by the previous trip. I was acutely aware of this. And to be honest I figured that if I took those 60 pills it #8217;d kill me. But I said fuck it. I actually said fuck it out loud before I swallowed all 60 of those red gel-caps. I figured it #8217;d either be a mean trip. Or I #8217;d finally die. Which was all I wanted at that point. By that point I had come to recognize how pathetic I was. How much of a disgrace to the uniform I was. I was frightened of hanging myself or shooting myself. So an overdose seemed like a fitting way for me to go out. Obviously it didn #8217;t work. My seniors found me holding onto the walls in the barracks. Apparently I #8217;d lost my room key. They were all actually trying to help me. To save me. But the Office on Duty saw me. My first memory of the incident was MP #8217;s shining lights in my eyes. Next thing I knew I was in ER. After that they sent me to the psych ward. After that they decided to discharge me. After that they sent me back to rehab. Then they tried to give me an OTH discharge via NJP. Which I refused. I fought for about 2 months to get my current GUH discharge. Don #8217;t know why I did that either. There was something terrifying about having my honor called into question permanently. So I fought them. Consequently they held me in the Duty Hut on suicide watch from August to the very end of October 2018. Which sucked ass, but I think I probably deserved it. So that #8217;s the end of the story. I #8217;m a disgrace to the Marine Corps. All I wanted to be since the age of 8 years old was a US Marine. People put themselves at risk to give me the chance to earn that title. I earned it. I even got my preferred MOS in the infantry. Everything I wanted so badly was given to me. But I threw it all away for selfish reasons. It #8217;s a pathetic story, but it is also my story. And I felt the need to share it with somebody. Personally, I think the recruiters should #8217;ve told me to f-off. I was disqualified by the Autism, and the extent of drug use I admitted to was staggering. I don #8217;t blame them for what happened, and I can #8217;t blame them for what I did. But all of this could #8217;ve been prevented. Would I be better off without this experience today? Who #8217;s to say? There are undoubtedly people in my life today that wouldn #8217;t be around. If I hadn #8217;t gone down this path. Then the conditions that lead to me meeting them would never have been set. People that I love the same way that I love my own family. They wouldn #8217;t be in my life without my failure and disgrace in the Marine Corps. I think that makes all of it worthwhile in the end. She #8217;s definitely makes all of it worthwhile. How do you find somebody like her without walking through a bit of hellfire first? TL;dr: I enlisted in the Marine Corps fraudulently. I lied about preexisting psychiatric conditions and the cause of certain scars. With the approval of my recruiters. (For the record.) Following success at Boot Camp and SOI. I returned to heavy drug use, and self isolation. I received help, but eventually returned to it anyway. After attempting suicide, or overdosing. I honestly don #8217;t know which. I was finally discharged.</TEXT>
