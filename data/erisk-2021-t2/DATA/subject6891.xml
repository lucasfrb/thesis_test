    <TITLE>Do poly/mono marriages ever work?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-01 16:00:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Me (f44) married to my husband (41) for 16 years. My husband and I are very close. We see a marriage counselor regularly. Not because there are problems but because we want to prevent them. We are very big communicators and very much still in love. I didn't have the vocab back then but was solo poly with a long term secondary when I met my husband. I broke it off with my secondary. We both hated it but I loved my soon to be husband very much and was afraid to lose him. Yes, I should have discussed it. I didn't. I felt wrong and weird, and had no idea there was a word for what I was. I really loved my secondary in a different way than I love my husband but I couldn't figure out how to explain that. I tried two times. The first when we went exclusive and the second right after we got married. I really did not want to give up my secondary and he didn't want to give me up. 16 years later I realize what I was, what I am, and why it's felt like slowly a light inside me has been dimming my entire marriage. I came out (edit: apologies for the problematic language. I screwed up, pls see my post below) to my husband a couple of months ago. He didn't take it well initially but after some time seemed to be more open. The more open he is to the possibility the more that light is back. Everyone who knows me has noticed a hugely positive change in me. Does this ever work? Can this work? He says he doesn't think he's poly at all and doesn't have any interest in pursuing his own outside relationship. Am I screwed? I love him dearly. More than. If he forces me to choose, the choice is him, but I'll be a lesser person for it and that makes me sad. Also, I want to let him set the pace here. At the same time I don't want him to let the subject die or let him keep putting off his decision. I definitely don't want to pressure him. How on Earth do you skate this line and still get resolution without waiting indefinitely?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Poly in a small town?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-28 12:11:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Anyone with experience being poly in a small town? I live in the kind of place where I run into my postal carrier, grocery store cashiers, dentist, etc just out and about and we've lived here long enough that we're known. I've recently started seeing a poly person in town. We were recognized at a local restaurant out at lunch the other day. We managed to avoid much awkwardness but still, it was a near thing. Anyone else deal with this? This is a small, conservative town. Unfortunately meeting at one another's home or in a different town doesn't work for us for a slew of reasons. I'm not embarrassed to be seen out with him but worried about it happening while we're being affectionate. WTF would I even say? I feel like I need to have something in my back pocket. Any suggestions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and the guy I just started seeing are actually becoming friends! I think all of us might end up being pretty tight. About 5 months ago when I first brought up my polyamory to my husband his reaction led me to believe I'd just ruined our marriage. He was suspicious, upset, insecure, and heartbroken I would want to go outside our 16 yr marriage. It's been a journey with therapists and reading and lots of talking but wow he has really just stepped up and embraced this whole thing. He's even at the point of being able to accept the guy I was with when he and I met. He's just fantastic and has blown me away with his willingness to confront his own fears and insecurities and really stare them down. He's being a total champ about my relationships and even cultivating some of his own and just really enjoying the process which is just so fun to see  #128513; I just wanted to share my joy and also post something hopeful for all the poly people wondering if it's possible to transition from a mono marriage happily. Yes, it is, with enough dedication and work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quite by accident I met a guy recently. We were just friends. He's monogamous and looking to settle down. Definitely not for me. He also is very aware of my situation (happily married for a very long time with multiple partners of varying commitments). Well he's fallen for me and dammit, I like him too. Is this madness of the highest order to get involved? It sure seems like it. But I really like him. He baked me cookies. From scratch. And they're really good. I mean, come on. That's the sweetest dirty pool ever.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Their concern just kills me!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-10 16:15:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>My guys are constantly blowing me away with their concern and thoughtfulness. About a month ago I had a date with a brand new guy. Within 10 minutes of each other, about an hour in, I get texts from hubby, ldr partner, and local bf checking in to make sure everything was going ok. (Incidentally this is the only time they've ever done that and the only bad date I've had. They're tuned in or something lol) Recently hubby has been dating a lot. Pretty much every day. I haven't been going out much because I have established relationships. 3 of them have expressed concern about my well being during this high activity time of hubby's. Including hubby himself. (It's fine. In fact I love seeing him have so much fun.) One of my guys is active duty military (deployed overseas) and he's constantly joking with me that he knows guys who pilot drones. Just drop some GPS coordinates on him and he'll take care of anyone who messes with me since he can't be there for me now. The other day I was out on a photo hike with one and kept hitting these slick muddy patches. He caught me every time and if there was somewhere I needed to stand that wasn't steady he steadied me. They're all very protective without being creepy or overbearing about it and it's just the sweetest thing ever. I just love being poly so much and having all this love in my life. It's the greatest thing ever.  #9829; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I first brought up my polyamory to my husband of 16 yrs I was certain I had broken our marriage. That was several months ago. Since then he has not only embraced it but found that it fits him perfectly too. Yesterday we were cuddling on the couch after I got back from a breakfast date and before I headed out today to go meet a long distance potential. He looked at me, smiled in just the best way possible, and said, "I didn't think it was possible, but you're even more beautiful to me since we started this. I don't know if it's the change in your energy or what, but you're just stunning lately." Be still my heart! How did I get so lucky?  #128525; #129392; #128525; #129392;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, you were creepy. Like Nice Guy creepy. Don't announce yourself at a first meeting by texting me a picture of myself waiting on you. CREEPY Don't assume you can use my room to change right after we meet and then act surprised when I say nope. CREEPY Don't make a joke about how you'd like to eat me (out or cannibalism neither is ok) when we're standing outside alone in the dark. CREEPY Don't try to figure out which car is mine. CREEPY All of that paired with your utter desperation and neediness just FREAKED ME OUT. I could not handle you alone in the woods today. COULD NOT. So yeah, sorry not sorry. Believe me, I was disappointed too. I was so hoping you would not be creepy and we could hang out and end up back in my room later. Instead...I got whatever the fuck that was. I keep expecting you to show up at the hotel to see if I really left. I will lose my shit on you so hard you will regret ever meeting me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We've loved each other for such a long time. 12 years apart didn't change that. Marriage to other people didn't change that. 600 miles between us didn't change that. So why am I so damn afraid of your new love interest? You said you told her about me. You said we were forever this time. That you just don't want to be alone down there. I don't want you to be alone. I want you to be happy. Don't forget you love me while you're learning to love her, please. I think this is a foolish worry. As foolish as your worry when I met *him*. Our love is transcendent. Others can't overshadow it. I'm still afraid. Do you still love me? Is it my turn to ask and pretend like I don't mean it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think anything will change after the 16th. I think you'll still be too busy. I think you'll still edge me in around the periphery of your life without ever making me a part of it. I think you'll continue to keep me apart from who you are when you're not with me. You said your schedule will free up. And I'm hoping, but it won't be any different from before, and I think both of us know it. The only one still behind here is my heart. I imagine she'll catch up to the rest of us eventually. She can be a bit slow on the uptake. It's all that sunny optimism in her eyes. Makes it hard to see the bullshit she's stepping in sometimes. Starting to feel like it might be kind of deep with you. I've got options. You just happened to be the one I was dumb enough to fall for. I'm working on getting back up right now. I'm goddamn glorious and worth better than what you're currently offering. It makes me sad that you can't recognize that and mad at myself for not recognizing your inability or unwillingness to do so earlier. You've got some sweet words, I'll give you that. A silvered tongue perfectly tuned to my ear. I can be easily taken in. Your actions, though. They are the real truth-tellers here whether you recognize it or not. And they are speaking far coarser messages with far greater accuracy. I so wanted you to be who you seemed. Now I just desperately want to get you out of my heart for good. But I know with the right gilded words I'll be back under your spell. At least for a time. I know I'll give you another chance. What I don't know is how much damage has been done to us and whether it's too much at this point. I suspect it may be and my stubborn heart is going to require just a bit more proof first. Fine. Let's get on with it then so I can get on with me.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-13 13:46:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been years. Seven. Eight. I'm not sure. They run together into a sad blur. Maybe longer and my hopeful head just can't quite do the math right. God I started out so sure you'd pop aware at my ultimatum. Awake suddenly as if from a fevered nightmare of irrationality and bad decisions. I wasn't expecting you to say "Gee whiz, sis, you were right all along, what a fuck up I am!" I know I was judgmental. I know I was harsh. I know I was bossy. I was scared for, in a panic over the well being of, your kids. It was the wrong approach from the right place. You. You are like a version of dad that is all at once worse and better. You can exhibit real compassion and humanity, something he lacked, but you have the most tenuous grip on your basest self. He held his under tight rein. Most of the time. I kept hoping I'd hear from you. Not even an apology. Just hear from you. "Hey, I moved. I got married. I heard your favorite cat died, just wanted to say I'm sorry". Anything. Instead you learned I was proud of my nephews' accomplishments by spying on my social media and blocked me from your Instagram. I'm not sure what lies you told your children but your oldest blocking me immediately without even speaking to me when I reached out on his 18th bday means you won. You finally got to me. You've tried your whole life to reach that very inner, most vulnerable part of me, to find that most sensitive area in order to wound me in the most painful, harshest, permanent way possible and you could never quite land that strike. I know that drove you crazy, your inability to get to me. It used to puzzle me greatly why my own sister should want *that* as a goal, but it was always yours. Congratulations. The golden ring is in your possession. I hope it was worth it. Ask your children if they think so. I know they loved me very much before you decided to punish me with their absence. The thing that breaks my heart most of all is that in your desire to wound me you wounded them far more severely for something they had no hand in. My heart breaks for them all. For our entire fractured family, but especially for them. They're innocent, jerked around at the whims of selfish adults. Their lives and minds altered forever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's been over 48 hours since I heard from either of you. I can come up with all kinds of justifications and excuses for you. I want to. I do. You're busy, life is busy, whatever. But really? It takes literally less than 10 seconds to pull out your phone and send a quick text. Even if it's just an emoji. Instead I get radio silence from you both. B1, I think patterns shouldn't surprise me but they do. How dumb I was to think it was me who was responsible for your behavior years ago. Of course it was you all along. I'm glad you're happy. I wish I wasn't getting strung along in the process. I meant what I said. I always do. I seem to be the only one who does. I was just a convenience for you, wasn't I? A placeholder. That's all I ever am despite your pretty words. The ones i stupidly cling to with all my useless optimism about us. B2, You had such promise. Your words were even more of a siren song than 1's. Again, I let myself trust them. Again I was proven such a fool. You say exactly what I want to hear. Your actions tell an entirely different story. Over 48 hours, guys. I think I'm getting your messages, and they are separate and distinct, loud and clear. Don't worry, I'm not about to insert myself where I'm not wanted. For whatever the reason. See ya around maybe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes you feel like a stranger. Distant as the other side of the planet. Other times I get a taste of our old familiarity. You said I find you as I left you but I don't. I left a man who was as warm and familiar as a favorite hoodie. I came back to...this. I miss that cosmic flutter from your gentle intergalactic wings. That bright streak of your light across my sky. Where is that? It feels like a cobra I have to coax from a basket with an instrument I hardly know how to play. I don't like it. The head peeks over the edge, a glitter of eyes, the flick of a familiar tongue and it's back in the basket again, a utilitarian genericism staring me in the face. I ask myself if it's just me. Did I let my issues get the best of me? Did my spines poke out too far? Did you get pricked? I'm so sorry if you did. You can't just leave me like that. Even when there's a good reason. I know you didn't abandon me, but you left me, and to my trauma brain it's the same thing. I hope we can close this rift. I think we need you. I think you need us. Don't let me slip away. I'll only keep trying to play you out for so long. I'll walk long before I look pathetic or desperate for anyone's company. My defenses are automatic and out of my control. I am doing my best to pull my spines back in and drop those walls. I have my part. Do yours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your (entirely understandable) absence wounded me. Not because you did anything wrong but because you found me damaged. Less so than 10 years prior but damaged all the same. I could not tell you these things. I try to play it close to the chest, these problems of mine. Try to keep them facing inward so only the intricate, carefully designed backs show to the world. You have x-ray vision. I came over yesterday needing your touch, your mouth, your closeness. I wanted your body. I needed your soul. I could ask for the first and did. The second? That sort of vulnerability burns like starfire. No matter. You knew. Somehow you knew. You gave me your touch. Your hands tracing my torso, caressing me. Your gentle yet urgent mouth against mine. But you stopped. You sat me on the couch. You answered every question I couldn't ask. You gently embraced that raw vulnerability and brought it to the collective that is us, pressed it to our collective heart, and sighed, "This". I relaxed, opened to you, and found my lungs again. Thank you for not being the truth my twisted head tried to paint. Friday will be so very sweet and I am counting the minutes. xoxo</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"I love you," a soft rush of words from you during a silence between us as we sat in that cabin in the woods, the fire dying before us, the light going dim.  #8203; You've been gazing at me in a way that told me this was coming for weeks. I'm easy to fall for. "Good partner material," my therapist calls me. My attractiveness, my uninhibited sexual nature, my lack of pretense, these things are siren songs to men like you. But that feeling? That's infatuation. Feelings are easy. Love is work. You don't know me well enough to know the work involved in loving me. And it is work. I'm difficult between the ease and there's a lot of space between that ease. We haven't known each other long enough, spent enough time together, for you to fall into a gap. Yet. My husband has. A lot. He's got the topography of me memorized. The valleys, the peaks, the forests, the oceans. There is danger and pain lurking all along my landscape if you don't know how and where to step, and sometimes even if you do. My other long term partner knows them all just as well. The third, newer one? He's learning. He's fallen into a gap. I wasn't sure he was coming back out, but he did, unshaken and surprised to find me sure he would be.  #8203; But you? You haven't even noticed that there are gaps. I've tried to warn you, tried to explain how suddenly the crevasse can appear and swallow you up, swallow me up sometimes. You don't understand. You say you do, but you don't. You can't until you find yourself falling and wondering wtf just happened.  #8203; That climbing out, that finding your footing once you land so you can, that's love.  #8203; We haven't even gotten started.  #8203; I like you a lot. I think maybe love could happen eventually. But right now? No, baby, you're infatuated with me, deeply so, but that's easy. Lots of people find themselves in that same spot. The shine wears off this penny pretty fast though once you start noticing the cracks in my surface. Just wait.  #8203; The disappointment will be enormous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me (f40s), my husband of 16 years (m40s), and one of my boyfriends (m40s) are all getting pretty tight. Without getting too salacious we had our first sort of group sexual encounter which is a huge step for my husband who is discovering he may not be as straight as he thought ( #128513;!). BF and husband have a standing weekly lunch date. Nothing romantic, just two dudes who enjoy each other's company hanging out and talking about me (and other stuff, I'm not that fascinating). They're becoming great friends and as bf put it yesterday we've tapped into a very addictive formula here. All of us were flying high yesterday before and after. Ever since I met BF I've secretly held this fantasy of the three of us forming a solid triad (I think he's had it too). I never thought it would be possible. But now...maybe! I was talking to hubby and we were marveling over the chemistry and connection between the three of us. It's blowing my mind how all of this is falling into place  #9829; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's science! Prayers didn't save your husband, medical technology did. God didn't spare you from that house fire, modern technology did. All your church friends baking spaghetti and praying over your kid didn't heal them THE MEDICAL STAFF AND SCIENCE DID. You all look ignorant and ungrateful as hell when you gush over the armchair FB "prayer warriors" and don't have shit in the way of thanks for all the doctors, nurses, and researchers who actually made the difference. Fuck your religion. It's garbage and backwards as hell. Have you ever even read the damn Bible start to finish, any of you? It's a contradictory mess that makes even less damn sense than Scientology but you just blindly believe because you've been told it's true.  #128580;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So we've decided that we don't care if you realize we're poly. We're not going to shove it in your faces but we're done hiding what we're doing too. If I'm out with BF2 I'm going to post on FB about going camping with him. If I'm visiting ldr partner I'm going to tell you why I'm in homestate 4x a year now. If I'm out with husband and BF1 at the same time because they surprised me with a joint date I'm gonna post about it. We're happy, dammit, and we should be able to celebrate that on our social media accounts. If your uptight mythology can't handle it, well, stay upset about I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every time my phone alerts and it's not you I'm disappointed. And I hate myself for it. I know if I just cut you off I can end this. It'll hurt like hell. But for less time than this drawn out agony of waiting on you to notice, to care, to toss one scrap of attention my way. I've talked. Said my piece. You've heard it. What else can I do? Accept what you're willing to offer which isn't enough for me. Or walk. I hate both those options but they're all that's on offer. How the fuck am I to pick? What I'm really trying to choose is the answer to "Am I in love with you?" because if I am I stick it out, wait for your life to settle. Hope it does. It won't. I'm stupid. If I'm not I walk because I'm too smart to sit around and hope for attention from one man when I've got 4 others dying to give me attention. Three of whom have said, outright to me, that they love me. Two of whom I love. Why am I waiting on you to show me yours? Why is yours so damn important to me? Because I tasted of it and it was sweet. You should never have given me that taste. It was a cruelty if you never intended to make good on your promised intent. I am no closer to an answer. You have me still. For now. I hate you for occupying my every fucking thought, for making my face so tense. Oh I am so done. Why can't I say the words? Why can't you be the person I thought you were? Why do you seem so awful now? You're killing me. Do you even notice? I am stupid and weak. I don't need you. Why am I acting as if I do?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-11 13:19:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Maybe you had it out for me. I ran over your kitten before you spat me into a fleshloaf. I have no idea. I know I spent the majority of my 40-some years, at least those in which I was aware of my vanity, feeling ugly and fat and inadequate. I was too tall and fat, so I walked hunched over and wore clothes that were too large for me. I wanted to compact myself and hide myself. I wanted to go unnoticed. My tits were too big, my laugh too loud and frequent, my voice too booming, my movements too crashing. I was too much presence, not enough femininity, not enough grace. Too much. Not enough. The same coin spinning endlessly. I never thought I would stop. I never thought I would find anyone to love me, even a little bit. But I did. I still have my days where I feel fat and ugly and inadequate, but mostly? Mostly these days I feel beautiful and tall and admired. I feel capable and strong. My laugh is loud and booming because life is truly grand and there is great shit to laugh about and speak in a loud, projecting voice about. I step loudly, purposefully. I plant my feet solidly on the ground. They carry my large, tall, strong frame in great strides from place to place while I hold my head high knowing, finally, I was never ugly or too much or not enough. I was always just right. It was the people around me who fell short and to make themselves feel better, they put the blame on me when I could least defend myself. I am pure armor now. It's made of self-love and self-assurance. The blame rolls off and I accept none of it. I have love beyond measure in my life. The admiration of truly incredible men who respect and admire me and find me incredible and wonderful to be around and, as two of them put it yesterday, "gorgeous". I am solidly into middle age and I am just now hitting my stride. It's fucking fantastic and I plan to eat my fill. Anyone who doesn't like the way or how much I eat can kiss the fattest part of my ass.</TEXT>

This one is crystal clear. I hate losing you. I had only just started loving you. You made it so easy. I was too quick to trust. To eager to hand over my heart. You felt so safe. I'm still trying to get my head around the fact that I could have misjudged so badly. It's hard to believe. I'm still holding on to a spark of hope that you'll come back.

The same day you tell me you have no time for me (without actually telling me that, fuck how I hate reading between the lines with people) you had a lunch date with my husband. A relationship with me isn't a requirement for one with him. I know he's great. I married the guy didn't I? But great as he is he's not worth jerking me around. And it's not necessary. I'm worth better consideration and he agrees. This will poison your friendship if you don't handle it carefully. I'm not an idiot but my optimism sometimes means I'm a bit slow because I don't want to see. I'm starting to see I was right all along. Do I tell you? Make you face your reality? Or just fade away and let us morph into nodding acquaintances as you become "a friend of my husband's" instead of "a boyfriend my husband is friends with"? Tough call. Maybe I'll flip a coin.</TEXT>

I want us back. I hope your non-answer is you crafting a way to make that happen, but it's not. I need to stop hoping. I think you want this. I wish you would have just asked for it.

What if somehow you and I have created a perfect shitstorm and have ruined us with nonsense? If we're meant to be we will, right? This is my driving philosophy about everything. I have no control over anything but me. I want to tie you to me, cement you to my shadow, find your strings for my hands and send my anxiety to rest. What an impossible, and futile, desire. If I reach out, drop a folded note in your lap, "Hi" with hearts and flowers, will it reach you? In that maelstrom, that cave of darkness you've backed into. Can it find you there? Can you see me out here in the sun waiting still? Realize that dark storm is not you, it's your prison. Sometimes prisons become comfortable. When they no longer are is when the despair gets deepest. Find your tail, comet, and streak across my sky. You don't belong in a cave. You should be pulling starspark out of my fountain effortlessly in your particular giddy fashion. Make me lose sight of my own air again. I love your brand of breathlessness. My light is lesser without you. I'm not sure what that means for me if you don't return to it. I love you.

    <TEXT>What do you do when one if your partners becomes overly attached to you? I'm not talking Fatal Attraction here. I just mean they have much deeper feelings for you than you have for them. I like this partner, have great affection for them, but they are speaking of tying up to relationship milestones I'm not even close enough to spot on the horizon yet. This is causing a few issues, namely that they're getting jealous over time spent with other partners (scorekeeping) and want more of me than I'm willing to give. It's creating an odd tug of war between us where they get insecure over the time they feel they're not getting and I have to remind them of what they are getting. We talk when this comes up, they say they're ok and get it, but happens again. I'm really afraid if this continues it's going to ultimately end us which neither of us wants but I'm not sure how to fix it. Or if I can. Any suggestions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what my therapist said to me in my last session as I was talking about various things happening in the polycule. And? She's right. My life has some added drama in it since the husband and I decided to open up. But I told her, and meant it, that even so, I still wouldn't change a thing. Even with the added drama I still feel more whole, more authentic, more *me* than I have in such a very long time I find I don't even mind the stress. Yes, monogamy lacked it all, but it lacked a fullness too. It was flat and dim and 2 dimensional. I don't think I'm unique here by any stretch. Who else has experienced increased contentment in spite of increased drama? ETA: To be clear, by "drama" I mean added complications, not like Jerry Springer craziness or anything. We have some pretty hard lines when it comes to that daytime TV type stuff. The one person in our 'cule who was a dramawhore was quickly ousted. No room for that nonsense.</TEXT>

It scares me to death. If it were real, if it were worse, how would I know? I would not. But my mind insists on scaring me with these images, these mini-movies of fear. It's better, this likely safe imagining, than the almost Occam-certainty of your ability to so easily ignore me. How did this happen? Why? We were so close. We marveled at that instant comfort, that outstanding ease we'd never had with anyone else. WHAT HAPPENED? How did it all go so unbelievably wrong? I look back and I can't tell. Was it me?

    <TEXT>I could have rolled over, wagged anxiously, maybe even peed a little as I begged you not to hurt me without using those words. I wanted to do those things. It's my natural drive to show how I'm not a threat. How I'm pliable and helpful. My head, when it feels such things about someone, when they pull away, it can't accept their words, their truth. It wants to beg. It wants me to turn quivering and pathetic. That pull is strong. I almost gave in, did a bit. You answered me. Enough. My heart doesn't lie to me. It never has if I'm listening with true ears and not wishful or crazy ones. It has some pretty peaceful things to say about you. Quiet ones. It really wants my head to calm down. It has a big-picture wisdom my head lacks. Instead I gave you my vulnerability in love. I told you there was space here. I told you it was nice here even when the world wasn't. I tried to fling that light across our canyon. May your heart hear it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You came flying through my window all warm and friendly. A helpful, loving presence. I was sure of your eternity. You flew around my space, inside my head and heart. You caressed everything about me. Warming it up, showing me possibilities, my god, the things I saw through you. Then I realized I could see through you. You were translucent. The daylight was filtering through. You were filtering out. Fading. I panicked. You told me it was ok and temporary. I believed you. My whole heart believed you. Your spirit had never lied to me. Why would you lie now? Then I saw your transparence. No longer abstract shapes, now I could see the lines of the world right through you. I saw you looked like a ghost. You grew lighter and lighter. So faint. Are you just a projection now? You said not. I believed you. My heart believed your spirit. I heard ducks in the distance. My heart insisted they weren't you. Now I don't see you at all. Sometimes I dream your noise. Sometimes I wish for it. Mostly, though, I wonder what I've done to drive it away. I wonder if my heart was wrong. The ducks are louder. I still don't know if they're you, but I'm not sure what else to attribute the sound to. I wasn't looking for a Casper. I wasn't looking for ducks. I wasn't looking for you at all. You pursued me. I came out of the dark and handed you my name. My power. How dare you. How dare I. Don't quack at me. Don't haunt me. Come here and love me or leave my heart alone. You destroy me with your silence every hour and you don't even realize. Or maybe you do and that's the point. Effective.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>To the people who wanted to kill my parrot</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-26 11:36:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>About 6 years ago I was volunteering at a bird rescue when I saw him getting picked on by a couple of other parrots. He clearly wanted to get away but couldn't fly or climb down. I walked over to this sad, practically bald bird with the chest wound from where he'd crash landed trying to get away from being bullied days earlier. He lifted his leg, desperate, not caring he didn't like people much, "pick me up, save me, please take me away from all these other birds," his eyes were begging me. I stuck my hand out, he stepped up grabbing me with a death grip. I moved him, gave him a treat (that he clearly wanted but wouldn't take from my hand) and went to ask the director who you were. You were neglected, abandoned, forgotten in a back room for 5 years. They had a baby. You were a feathered fish in a cage that repeated to them. They didn't see you, the real you inside that sweet feathered head. They didn't want to see you at all. They were going to have you killed. In the first few years you lived with me you sent me to the ER for stitches in my face a couple of times, left scars on my face, arms, hands and feet. Terrorized my husband, the cats, the dogs, destroyed countless things from wood trim to shoes, and shit on pretty much everything. Ok, to be fair you still do those last few. I've learned the zen of living with pantry moths while also fighting those motherfuckers with every (nontoxic) thing I've got. I've also learned TVs don't go as loud as parrots no matter how high up you turn that volume. This morning you're bored and letting me know it. You're driving me batshit. It's ok. I'm glad you live in a place where you're free to go where you like and can drive me batshit because you're bored. And you're only bored because in the 6 years you've been here you've gotten used to getting what you should have. But this letter isn't to you, baby bird, this letter is to the people who had you before. This letter is to the kinds of people who came into the rescue saying "I want a big, colorful bird. That talks!" This letter is for anyone who thinks birds are just feathered fish that talk. You can't do that to intelligent animals. You can't willingly take part in the exploitation of intelligent, wild animals (and all parrots are still wild even if born in captivity) and then drop your end of the bargain because life gets too hard. These guys are as intelligent as any toddler. They use words in context and understand abstracts, like zero. They form emotional bonds, they get attached, they have individual personalities. You gave up on a funny, sweet, intelligent, curious friend. Worse. You mistreated and neglected a helpless animal that was entirely dependent upon you for his food, water, enrichment and interaction. You provided the first two, but not the last. Which is why he plucked all of his feathers out. Why he still plucks his chest feathers to this day. You are not good people. I won't go so far as to say you are evil. I don't know you. But I know enough to know that you are not good if you could do that kind of damage to an innocent bird and then decide to euthanize him because he was now too much trouble. I hope you raise the baby you neglected him for better than that. Also? Parrots are basically tape recorders and your husband was having an affair. Ta, Me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last night my husband wanted to take me out for a fancy dinner. A last date before I go away to school for a couple of weeks. We get to the restaurant and 2 of my boyfriends are there waiting at the table already! With a bourbon sitting at my place waiting for me! These guys had been plotting this for weeks. They had the wait staff in on it and everything. After dinner when out waiter brought out the dessert menus he put a laminated sheet in front of me. It was a different kind of menu one of my guys made up with a selection of after dinner activities I could pick from. I chose pool and beer. We had such a great time! I loved being surrounded by so much love! I got hugs and kisses and affection all night from all 3 of them and I was in pure heaven! At the end of the night all the guys hugged. I got kisses, was told I was loved (I felt it!) and went home with my husband where we fell into bed exhausted. It was just such a great night. There were several stares and our waiter was an older guy and kind of confused but man. What a great night!  #129392;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-31 13:56:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>You're a book I was in the middle of. One you swore I could read from cover to cover. I barely got past the table of contents. What I saw was outstanding. How dare you tease me with that. How dare I take you at your word. Big flaw of mine- believing people mean their words simply because I mean mine. My naivety is staggering. When I was a kid I caught this tiny turtle in a lake. I took it home and kept it for two weeks. I became attached to that turtle but my dad said we had to release it. He was right. The right thing to do was let it go. So we took it back to the lake. I whispered to it *please never forget me* before I gently placed it in the water and watched it swim frantically away from me. I hoped that one day in the future when I came back to that lake that turtle would recognize me with affection and swim up to say hi. It never did. I still think about that turtle. I tend toward unnecessary attachments to the oddest creatures sometimes. I imagine in 20 some years I'll still be thinking about you and wondering how your life went and if you remember our brief time together too. I'm old enough now to know you won't ever swim up. Bye, turtle. I'll surely miss you. I wish I had understood better how precious it all really was.</TEXT>

I keep telling myself I'm done with you, with this hope, this heartache. Words are just words. You persist in my head and my heart while being utterly absent from my life. I think my absence is a relief to you. And that cuts deepest, the idea I made a fool of myself trying to keep you in my life when you so clearly don't want me in yours. There's still a prairie with your name on it inside my head. The winds across it are empty and chill. It wants only for your sun. I know it's gone dark, but I can't help hoping to see a scrim of its yellow on the horizon every day I'm awake. That hope hurts and I look forward to the day it too goes dark.</TEXT>

It's super exciting but when my friends are struggling to pay the bills and in bad relationships it seems mean to talk about my good fortune.

I don't have to gird myself against half truths and lies. There really is another amazingly perfect fit for me in this world. And somehow I find you both not only madly in love with me but with enough *for* me to delight in my joy at an abundance of love in my life after such a dearth of it. I love you and am so grateful to have the love and devotion of such amazing men in my life. Having you join the pack is an extraordinary gift. One I feel both undeserving of and well-earned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's late and we've said goodnight. We've said more than that. You have swept me off my feet and it seems I've done the same to you. This love we have pulls the breath from our lungs like a giddy tornado. It's wild and chaotic, unexpected and somehow known. This is all. You said that. I can think of no truer statement. Kiss me until I can't speak and know we no longer walk alone at any point in our journey going forward. I love your beach, let me show you how easy it is to love my mountains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was very young I saw Madonna's "Material Girl" video. I was smitten immediately. Not with Madonna, or the theme of the song, but with the men she was surrounded with. Not individually, but as an idea. Being surrounded by people who loved you enough to try to buy your love in return seemed about as good as it got. Shallow message for a 7 yo to take away, but I actually believe that's when the poly switch flipped in my head. After that I found myself over the years utterly disgusted with the fact women couldn't have as many husbands as they wanted. I thought it was a supremely stupid limitation. Jump forward a bunch of years and I'm married to an amazing man. The kind of "lightning in a bottle" marriage movies are made around. The love this man has for me is immeasurable as is mine for him. We open our marriage and it's amazing. Better than we imagined. We find love and friendship in unexpected places. We revel in our amazing life. It can't get better than this. Until it does. Hub's BFF of 25 yrs and I have fallen madly in love which absolutely no one saw coming. The kind of love I felt and feel for hubs. Hub's thinks this is great. All 3 of us see a future in which we live together. A future in which I have two husbands for all intents and purposes. These guys love one another. They say it to each other nearly daily. The love between the 3 of us is unsurpassed. I've been holding this for weeks and still can't quite believe how beautifully everything is just clicking into place. How is this my life?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you said you always get close to exactly what you want but never quite have it for yourself you were speaking in frustration. I think you were talking about me. You asked me if I'd ever consider being monogamous again. I thought you were worried you might get dumped. Now I think it might be that you were wondering if something terrible befell my husband you might have a chance at having me all to yourself (sorry to dash those hopes). You asked me about kids (nope, never) because you still want them. I never have. We can never be legally married. I'll never have your children. You will always share me. And yet you say you're willing to make those sacrifices to be with me, to make our family a little stronger. I believe you. I also think you're mourning those things you're giving up on. I hope I'm worth it. You say I am. Let me not make a liar of you.</TEXT>

Your love for me is still a fire hydrant of a thing after 17 years and it's reflected right back. J, the second: right in front of my face for 17 years. How did we miss it? I'm glad we did or the three of us would have been very hurt. Your love is Niagra falls. Overwhelming, deafening, unending. You are the second person who loves me for me. You ask me to be only who I am and nothing more. The two of you have been bff's for 25 years. How is it I have you both so thoroughly committed to me, to us? You two have brought a flavor of light into my life I've never imagined. The 3 of us are a family. I think when J2 moves up here I'm changing my name and hyphenating his in.</TEXT>

I'm already not seeing family. You were the one thing that was going to make this holiday and going back to school on my bday ok. Now you can't make it. I hope I can. I don't want to clean or decorate or wrap gifts. Why bother? So I'll do what I always seem to do this time of year and sit quietly until it's over. There was going to be a group dinner for me and a breakfast. Now I don't want any of it. I told him to just cancel it all. I don't want to see anyone or do anything. I'll just fill my days getting ready for school and trying to ignore what time of year it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I eat once a day. Don't ask why. It's fine. I'm healthy. My Dr knows and is ok with this and that's all the pertinent information anyone needs. I decided today would be a burger so I get one on my way home from running errands so I can eat while I get some work done. I take one bite and it's totally undercooked. I don't eat pink hamburger ever. This was so pink though the out side half mm was all that was actually cooked. I can't go back, no transportation now. So I'm stuck with no food for the day as there's nothing here I can actually eat. (And no I can't cook it myself. We don't have a kitchen as it's under remodel.) Why the fuck do restaurants get so up their ass about getting people through asap that they neglect the extra 3 minutes it takes to finish cooking said food? This is far from the first time I've experienced this but it's usually anything fried that gets the shaft- soggy fries, etc. Undercooked, factory farmed meat is a fucking health hazard!</TEXT>

Every other time I get sent to crap islands. No bugs, hardly any fish, same fruit and flowers as on my island. And several times the island is just 3 levels of cliffs surrounded by ocean, no rivers or ponds at all. If I'd initially landed in one of those as my island I'd be dead from lack of fresh water. Now, the first time I did this and it worked Ollie didn't blush, he just smiled. After that when I could get Ollie to blush I ended up on terrible islands. Anyone else experience this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been a writer for a long time but most of it was technical writing. I ventured into fiction about six years ago. Over the past two I've been shopping my short stories out and getting rejected plenty but I just got a magazine who loves my work and wants to publish it even though it's far beyond their word count for fiction submissions. It's the same place one of my mentors got published at first which landed her a book deal. The editor has been incredibly complimentary of my work. I'm super excited!</TEXT>

Don't worry about freaking out the other person. If your desire to know whether or not you match up on important shit like that intimidates them then they're not worth bothering with anyway. My first dates before I was married were all the same; coffee/dinner, getting to know you talk and pointed questions about whether they wanted kids (I didn't), if they were bigoted in anyway (instant end to the date if so), and how they handled their finances. Are they a saver, a spender, or under a mountain of debt? Those three topics are deal breakers if you're not on the same page with all three.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look at your first draft as notes. Finish it as well as you can. I'm not kidding when I say it's going to go through a bunch if changes. My first novel had 4 drafts and then I tossed the whole thing out and am rewiring it as short stories. Give yourself the freedom to change stuff up, add it in, take stuff out, etc. I'd also recommend putting it away for 6 weeks or so and coming back to it with fresh eyes and perspective. Right now you're so involved in your own work you can't "see" it. Give your eyes a break and start something new.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;figure a certain amount of lying or  #8220;omitting #8221; is acceptable in a relationship, You're wrong. Dishonesty is not acceptable in any relationship. Being 100% truthful and honest isn't possible, but that's not a pass to be a liar either. I've been with my husband for 20 years. We've never lied to one another. We've been mistaken and we've misunderstood the other but we have never deliberately lied to one another.  gt;Realistically, I just want to know the truth. Realistically, you don't know what's the truth. Your gf is an admitted liar. You admit it yourself. How you have trust in someone like that is something I can't get my head around.  gt;I asked my GF if any of it was true. She said no and that I was being controlling, sensitive, and untrusting. I #8217;m not sure where to go from here, as I don #8217;t want to throw the friend under the bus. Well you can stop believing anything a liar says. You can have actual boundaries around being lied to (no one has to accept this in a relationship, no one should), you can recognize her words are abuse and deflection and you can recognize you will never have a healthy, fulfilling relationship with a liar. What you need to be asking yourself is what's gone wrong in your development to make you think any of this is ok.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, and one other anecdotal thing: don't waste years waiting for truth. Accept now that you'll never get it from her. It doesn't mean you need to act on it, just accept it as reality. I wasted 4 years of my life waiting for a liar to be the person he said he was. It was a waste of 4 years I could have been working on myself instead. I did do that. I stayed single for a couple of years and figured myself out. When I reentered the dating pool I found a much higher quality of person in my life. I'd learned my own self-worth and that made anything outside its best interest untenable for me for any amount of time.</TEXT>

What most of them are doing now is not "accepting" any insurance at all, but they will file an out of network claim for you. You pay upfront and the insurance co sends you a reimbursement. If your insurance allows out of network providers try that route with an independent therapist. You'll get in much faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I can speak on is my experience within my own relationships. My feelings for my husband don't change even when I'm falling head over heels in love with someone else. What my husband and I have is what only we can have. I can't get that with anyone else and I wouldn't want to. My husband is an expert at being himself. No one else can fill those shoes. Same with my other partner. My feelings for him don't change when I'm enjoying my relationship with my husband. I still love him the same. I still look forward to hearing from or talking to him. But what he and I have is something only the two of us can have. There is no "better" here. There is just difference, and that's not merit-based. It's just different. Knowing it's not a comparison can help a lot. How would you greet her if she'd been away with a friend? Would you ask her how her weekend was? How much detail do you want? Figure that out. She's free to not share anything if she prefers to keep it private or if he wants his business kept private. But figure out *your* comfort level ahead of time. If hearing how she gave him head 30 times is going to make you freak out, ask her to keep any sexual details to herself. You're allowed boundaries here too.</TEXT>

I have two, in fact; my legal husband and my other partner. They're bff's, have been for 25 years. They're both upstanding, kind men and there are plenty of women pissed off at me for "getting" two of them. We've all dated jerks. I think it's less about being conditioned as women and more about how men are taught to treat women. The men I know and admire were taught to respect and revere women.

I can be as selfish as I want, I can stay up as late as I want. Not that either of them prevent me from doing anything, but close quarters call for consideration.

My husband has had gfs in the past I didn't trust any further than I can spit. I don't allow people I can't trust in my life so I didn't let them in my life. I'm not dating them. I don't have to like them, much less trust them. It's not my relationship. It's my husband's. He's the one I have to be able to trust to maintain our agreed upon boundaries and to not fuck up our relationship.  gt;Being that this is all new to me, is it selfish of me to ask him to give me a some time where it's just the two of us? Not in the least. You need to be comfortable too. Ask him to use that time to read a book on polyamory together before anything happens.

    <TEXT>This woman is a walking red flag. 2 weeks in and you're already asking if she's too much work. The answer is absolutely yes. Also cptsd doesn't prevent one from working. It's not even a "real" diagnosis. I have it. It's just not been coded as a medical condition in the DSM. It can cause angry outbursts and some pretty big abandonment issues but it's not a thing that's a disability. Depression or anxiety may be preventing her from working but if that was the case she'd have said so and she'd be on disability. Saying her cptsd keeps her from working is absolute bullshit and an excuse not to work. Maybe she really can't but it's not due to her cptsd. No one in the medical field has told her this. She's making it up.</TEXT>

I had to point it out multiple time as did a few others. That guy wasn't the only one. I owned a business for 15 years. I was very clear about my policies and how I did business. People don't read a damn thing. I got asked questions constantly that were literally answered very plainly on the website and in the email they got. No one reads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Ever since one of my friends came out in 2018, we drifted apart because there wasn't much to talk about anymore, our taste in almost everything started to change as we aged, and he made new friends, and we kinda just forgot each other. It's just so sad, I don't want to go through that again and want to understand more about the LGBTQ+ community before I make that mistake again I understand what you mean now. This part here...I think you're confusing natural growth and evolution if human beings, which does mean you grow apart from people, as something caused by your friend coming out. It's not like that, though. People will change and it will mean you'll lose them out of your life. It's not necessarily a negative, it just is. But it will happen with all kinds of relationships in your life, not just with marginalized folks. And that marginalization is exactly why it now seems to so many as if everything is about LGBT life. It's not. But we see more of it as it becomes more normalized. Normalization happens when people are free to express themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ask them both why they've let it get so bad that all you hear out of them it seems are complaints about the other. Ask them if it's working out for them, handling this on their own. Ask this with a list of marriage counselors at the ready. How they're handling this isn't working for any of you. Time to call in some objective assistance. There's no shame in it but there is in refusing to do it if the means are there. Even if they do split up it'll be much less stressful, for everyone, if it happens with the guidance of a professional. Your parents shouldn't be dumping on you. It's inappropriate and puts you in an uncomfortable place. Tell them to knock it off in whatever words you like and maybe offer some individual options for therapy as well. At that point you will have done your part. So hang up the phone if they won't respect your boundaries and do it without guilt. You've done everything you possibly can to help the situation, but it's their marriage and they have to figure it out. You can't do that for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's deceptively easy. The hardest part is learning to make peyote triangles, which is really pretty easy once you get one or two done. Contemporary Geometric Beadwork is this outstanding project by Kate McKinnon that's been going on for over a decade. That's where I learned to make these. I don't have the link offhand but if you Google "cgb kaleidocycle" the tutorial will come up. It assumes you already know what peyote stitch is. If you don't, YouTube can show you. These really look daunting on their face but if you take it component by component they're not at all complicated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stop playing games and use your words. "I need more foreplay from you. I like (thing) and when you (thing). I need you to put forth this effort. I also need you to stop commenting on how dry I am. It's hormonal and there's nothing that can be done except more foreplay and more lube. When you being it up it makes me feel like garbage and that you're not attracted to me. I feel the same when I try to initiate sexting or send you nudes and don't get much if a response. Thus us what I need from you: to feel desired, to have more foreplay, to use more lube if you feel it's too dry for your comfort. What do you need from me to make these things something you want to do?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, they've known each other longer than I've known my husband, so that likely helps. But mostly it requires a lot of communication and effort in all relationships; mine and my husband's, mine and my other partner's, that of my husband and partner, and that between all 3 of us. Although they are in no way romantically involved with one another that relationship is still important. As for time management I divide my time about 50/50 between the two homes. We've worked out a schedule that works for all of us and we discuss changes as necessary. The only way a poly partner could "cheat" would be to not uphold previously agreed upon boundaries. We're all free to cultivate whatever relationships we like. Fears and insecurities can be discussed and handled. All of us are expected to practice safe sex and remain open about the people we're seeing.</TEXT>

Please don't kill them. If you don't want them around you can gently disturb her web. She'll bounce a few times and then drop and disappear. Tear the web down. They won't build where they attract attention like that. However, if you leave her alone she'll make an egg sac (and if you found that plump lady simply climbing around she was almost certainly looking for a place as she's getting pretty big) and at least one of her daughters will return and build her web there. As long as it's safe they'll return for years. They're beautiful and fascinating to watch and photograph. One of my favorite subjects when I can keep them from freaking out at the macro kit anyway. Like I said, they're cowards.</TEXT>

Hair falling out? Still gorgeous. I'm also with his oldest friend (25+ years, hubs and I are polyamorous) and this man is truly lovely to look at. He's fit and muscular and regularly gets hit on by women younger and prettier than I am. He only has eyes for me and did when I was heavier too.

    <TEXT>Dreams are a cheap and overused literary device. Dreams bore your readers to death unless they're short, germane, and do something to advance a story. 3 dreams in 7k words is a lot. If your words aren't moving the story your reader will skim. If they skim too much they'll lose interest and put it down. Introduce psychological tension in scene, not exposition. Few writers can write expository fiction that works. If you're interested in seeing one who can do it exceptionally well check out Larry Brown or Otessa Moshfegh. For the rest of us we have to show in scene how the character is feeling with their actions. It's a much more interesting read than reading about one's psychological struggles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gaslighting is being told what you see and hear didn't actually happen. An example from my own life (back in my early 20s); the guy is possessive and abusive. A very old and dear friend of mine was in town. A male friend. A *gay* male friend. He came by our apartment and he and I went for a walk around the complex. That guy got in his car and followed behind us the whole time. Eventually my friend decided it was too weird and went home. I asked my bf why he was following us. He replied "I wasn't following you. You're fucking nuts. I was just checking my car for problems. You're so suspicious of everyone". That's gaslighting.</TEXT>

If you consider the patriarchal culture we live under it makes perfect sense. You can't treat people like accessories. It's unethical and cruel. Just because you decide the game isn't as fun as you expected doesn't mean you should get to interrupt a 3rd party's life (your wife's partners). That's supremely shitty. Fix your own insecurities. That's all this is. You feel icky and bad because it's not fair. Too bad. Who told you life was fair? Just because you've had a rude awakening doesn't give you liberty to upend the table on others. This is all stuff one needs to consider before opening a relationship. You didn't and now you're carrying that burden. It's a heavy one.</TEXT>

To maintain that on the inside he can't afford to let himself feel much for you either. It's why the nice stuff has slowed down. He's probably not feeling nice and sweet the majority of the time.

I'm the hinge in my poly structure. As the hinge, it's my responsibility to be equitable with my time and attention. I have another partner whom I would marry in a hot second if it were legally possible. I split my time about 50/50 as well. It's important to my husband and I that he not feel like he's the only one handling things at our home, but it's equally important that I not feel like all I'm doing at either place is housework. Yeah, it's nice to get home and chill out, but...I can do that with my other partner too. The Switch is portable. I take mine with me. He may not be able to do that if you have kids that use it, but he needs to find his relaxation *after* his obligations. Also r/polyamory is a great sub.</TEXT>

He is with you because he wants to be. One of my partners is very fit and active, built too. He gets women half my age and way prettier than me hitting on him constantly. He doesn't even pay them any attention. His eyes are firmly on me and I'm 4 years older than he is and while I'm strong, I'm way TF out of shape. He jogs alone (srsly if I'm running everyone else better do it too because some shit is chasing me). If your bf was a gynecologist I doubt you'd have these fears because it's just his job. Try to think of nursing and photography that way. What you want is some kind of guarantee that it's ok to go ahead and love him because he won't hurt you. Life doesn't ever offer those. He may turn out to be a pigdog fuckstick. You'll be ok even if he does. It'll hurt like hell, but only for a little while. Don't squelch your spark out of fear. Go ahead and get afraid but do it anyway. That's what courage is. His actions will tell you if he's engaged in the relationship. Men who are just in it for sex don't stay engaged.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was a fundamentalist christian and had some questions that weren't being answered by the "pros". The first time I felt like I was in crazy town. Surely this wasn't the book I'd based all my beliefs about the world around me on. I must not have understood, right? So I read it again. This time it made more sense except for the parts that contradicted itself or made no sense given what we know about the world around us from a scientific and historical perspective. The third time I saw the misogyny and utter lack of compassion when there should have been some shown by any decent human being made me realize we aren't made in god's image. We made him in ours. In a logical and rational, thinking world an omniscient, omnipresent supernatural being isn't going to suffer things like jealousy or anger. That entity would have no use for either as they are both based in fear and fear comes from a lack of knowledge. That's why I read it and it made me an atheist ultimately.</TEXT>

Therapy can do this and so can purposefully remaining single for a year or two while you work on yourself. Do that and your picker gets fixed too. You'll stop settling for men who aren't what you want in a partner and getting cheated on ceases to be an issue. ENM folks can cheat too, all we have to do is pretend we're not doing something with some one when we are. Polyamory, relationship anarchy, none of it guarantees freedom from duplicity.

If anyone dares bring it up you can say gpa ought to know better at his age and while you didn't think it necessary to state out loud you are now letting everyone know unwanted sexual touching is a boundary you will not let be crossed under any circumstances. This is a perfectly fine, healthy boundary to have. But I bet they're too embarrassed to bring it up. Unless your bf comes from a family of troglodytes or something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Give him time. He may be willing to talk in a day or two. Even broaching the subject changes your relationship. You got a rather dramatic demonstration. But my husband didn't react well either at first. I gave him a few days. He was pretty upset. I asked if he would read a book on it with me, to learn about that part of me better. I made it very very clear he was to take all the time he needed to get his head around it and there were no expectations on my end. You didn't approach it incorrectly. It's a bombshell of a thing for a monogamous person who's not even familiar with the idea. My husband knew what it was but all he'd seen of it were trainwrecks in internet posts when it went tits up. He read a book with me. We talked. He went from "never" to "well you can date but I only want you" to "ok maybe I'll date" to "holy shit this whole other side of me has been missing this whole time! Thank you so much for showing me this!" to "yeah, ok, I'm poly too" in about 8 months. And we've been happily living that way for a couple of years now. I'm not saying your guy will react similarly, I just want you to know he might just need time. It's a hard concept for a monogamous-minded person to get their head around. All he's hearing is that you're not happy with him, he's not enough, and you're not committed to the relationship. None of those things are true, of course. When he's ready to have a conversation you can tell him that. Be kind to yourself. You haven't done anything wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. "Talking" someone into polyamory negates any polyamory. Polyamory is built on ethical behavior and it's unethical to try to convince someone they should do something they're not interested in doing. That's really shitty of Hannah toward her bf. It means she's not an ethical person. 2. Boundaries are for you, not other people. Rules are for other people. Your boundary that there be nothing sexual between them isn't a boundary, it's a rule. Your boundary is that you want greg to stop accepting her advances (and he is accepting them if he hasn't blocked her of his own accord yet). if he's accepting this behavior without cutting it off at the knees he's the one violating your boundaries, not Hannah. You're no longer in any kind relationship with her. If you want to make it a rule that greg recieve no sexual contact from hannah, then make it a rule, but it'll still be up to him to uphold it. Your boundary around that may be that if he doesn't make this stop, however he has to, you'll leave. Or stop sucking his dick or whatever. It's your boundary, you decide the consequence to it not being respected. If there are no consequences, however, boundaries are pointless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They do exist, but they require something from you first. You have to be comfortable in your own skin. If you're not, if you're just trying to be who you think you need to be in order to be liked, you'll never be truly liked. It's a helluva thing. There is something about yourself that you like. What is it? Can you sing, write, draw, juggle better than most? Do you have outstanding eyes? There's something. Find it and learn to actively like and appreciate whatever you can about yourself. Stay with it, you might feel dumb at first, it's ok. It won't feel dumb forever. The way we talk to ourselves about ourselves and the world around us determines what kind of world we have around us. Try paying attention to the stuff you're saying to yourself. Try reframing it into something kind. As an example I used to really beat the hell out of myself in my own head "oh you stupid fuck up, why can't you figure life out? Jfc you are such stupid trash" but now when I notice these thoughts coming up another voice steps in "hey! It's ok, it was a mistake. We'll fix it and move on. Next time we'll be more careful, we learned from this so time to move on, girlie". It sounds really dumb but it makes the biggest difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If your relationship (barring medical or physical issues) is dead in the bedroom, so is your emotional intimacy. You have to start there. Poly is what you do when you fix home. If you try to poly up a damaged marriage you won't find yourself fulfilled. You'll find yourself unmarried though. Even if both people agree to it, if the relationship is damaged it won't survive. Introducing poly into your life is like having a baby. It changes things in ways you can't imagine. It adds a lot of stress and uncertainty at times. It needs a solid foundation to build on. A damaged relationship isn't it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can't control how other people react. If she hurts herself it's because she's already mentally ill. Not because you broke up. If you're concerned that her threat us real, or if you're worried about her call her local police non emergency number and ask for a welfare check (if it's safe for her, I've no idea of race or locale). During business hours you can call adult protective services in her county (if she's in the US, idk about other countries) if you don't want to use the police. A welfare check will do one of two things; show her you take this deadly seriously and won't allow it to be used as a game or it's going to get her help if she's serious. Don't let her play games like this with you. It's a common tactic to keep a partner they sense has a foot out the door.</TEXT>

I'd be willing to bet they think they're communicating perfectly clearly, and they may be, for them, but the message isn't landing with you.

If it's actual forgetting (and writing it down should tell you) an evaluation may be something to consider if you've never been evaluated for ADHD, etc. Me and a partner have pretty severe add/adhd and we frequently miss obvious communication.

    <TEXT>Yes you could. You did before him. You could after him too. And if you truly believe you can't survive without this person you need to be the one to break up. I know you won't, but codependency breeds resentment. What will happen is you'll create a self-fulfilling prophecy and get what you most fear. It will happen in every single relationship you have until you deal with your underlying issues. Therapy, if it's at all an option for you, can fix this fear you have. You can he comfortable in your own skin. You can be perfectly fine, happy, and fulfilled alone. Being alone doesn't mean being lonely. If you love yourself you're never lonely. You can have peace.

    <TEXT>That kind of jealousy is almost always because the person you're jealous of is experiencing (or appearing to) fulfilment. We tend to focus on things like what they're accomplishing/buying, but it's not that we actually want what they have (we all want our own lives). We just want the fulfilment they have. Fulfilment is a slippery thing to people. They mistake happiness for it, but happiness is as fleeting as anything else. Fulfilment, on the other hand, is a stable force. You get it by getting comfortable in your own skin. Everything else follows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Remembering the actual rape is rare. Usually what imprints in your brain are weird details; a smell, a book title, the time on the clock, the feel of the floor beneath you, a laugh. It's bizarre. I've been through trauma therapy for my rapes and it still bugs me that I can't remember.</TEXT>

This is his *best* behaviour. This is as good as he ever gets. Who cares what he thinks about you? He's awful. Lots of people are insecure and don't make their partners feel like crap about it. Don't date someone because of who they *could* become. Dating potential never, ever works. You can't fix anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Single person? Assume 25 bucks per meal give or take . Those fees and tips add up quick. I've been living this way for the past year out of necessity. It gets pricey fast. We started economizing by ordering food from places that had huge portions so we could get 2 meals our of it. It's not ideal. Salary wise...I mean, do you want to live paycheck to paycheck or do you want discretionary income on top of eating out/delivery every meal? Because those are 2 different answers and they're both going to depend on where you live.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. "It's my turn to talk now" repeat as needed. Being a broken record works well here. Or pick up a book, etc, and just start reading. If he complains tell him he doesn't want to have a conversation. He wants to have a monologue and you're not interested in being an audience. 2. "Sorry, but you told me this same story last week. Don't get mad at me because you can't remember. What do you want to do for dinner tonight?" Don't dwell on this one. Address it and move on 3. "This situation sounds so tough to me. I know it's got you tied up in knots. I want to be a source of support but I really don't have the space to keep listening to you vent about this every day. I need you to please ask me "do you have the space for me to talk about my family?" before you dump on me. I can't be an effective and supportive partner if I'm exhausted from bearing the burden of your (family drama)." What this boils down to is that partners make shitty therapists. You can't be his. He needs a real therapist if this affects his mental state so badly.</TEXT>

Why don't we see a marriage counselor so I can truly understand your feelings about it" something like that. Make it about you wanting to be a better husband and father. She'll get told (gently and subtly) that she's holding on to this accident needlessly and it's putting distance between you and harmful to your father/son relationship which is really the message she needs but she's on the offense and isn't going to hear it from you. She might from someone else though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just Google "marriage counselor (your zip code)". Be aware that a lot of mental health providers no longer take insurance. You can thank the insurance companies for that. They make it impossible. So you may have to pay out of pocket, BUT most of them will file your insurance claim for you and you insurance will send you a check minus whatever copay they normally charge. Your first visit they'll ask you guys what you want to get out of counseling. They may ask to meet with you each individually for a session before taking you both on at the same time. Marriage counseling works if you can get through the parts where you want to walk out of the room. It's amazing how it can transform a marriage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have to be yourself. You can't try to form yourself around someone's expectations. You'll be miserable. Form yourself around your own. Will some people decide the true you isn't for them? Sure. It's a sign you're living your life right. the people who stick around are pure treasure. Let being yourself be your weeding out process. If "picky eater" is part of who you are say so. Tell him you're worried about money being wasted on something you may not like. It's fine. He may suggest a buffet of the same kinds of foods where you can sample whatever you like and eat bread if you don't like any of it. No one screws up bread. Also, most places will make a dish with no pepper/heat if you ask. Your post sounds very anxious. Is food anxiety something you find yourself dealing with a lot? If so you may want to look into therapy. I grew up the same way--mom knew a dozen dishes. I liked about 9 of them. I decided to be adventurous as I got older. In my teens you'd never convince me I'd even try sushi. I was sure I'd puke just walking into a place where people we're eating raw fish. Gross, right? It's one of my favorite foods now. So is Indian and Korean. Vietnamese and Thai too. Don't write yourself off. There is amazing food out there you can't imagine. I like indian food so much I learned how to cook it. The first time I tried it I wasn't sure what I thought. The spices were just so different. The second time I was hooked. If the restaurant the guy wants to take you to is Indian you can't go wrong with tandoori chicken. It's just a smoky kind of bbq technique and it is a very easy dish for newbies and picky eaters to enjoy. No weird flavors. Just chicken seasoned with garlic, lemon and paprika, and served with rice. Most every exotic place will have something inoffensive like this.</TEXT>

It was all I'd eat at sushi restaurants for years. I eventually tried the raw fish stuff and found I LOVED it. I hate cooked fish but I'll eat it raw with rice, soy sauce, and pickled ginger all day long. Try weird stuff, but ask the person you're with to suggest the least weird thing first.</TEXT>

Been with my husband 20 years. We've never fought and we're polyamorous so there's definitely material and opportunity to create some big ones if we were so inclined. My other partner and I are so very much alike we do fight, but it's healthy fighting. No name calling, door slamming, things being thrown; fast apologies for anything hurtful that may come out of our mouths.

    <TEXT>You could try reaching the understanding that getting blackout drunk on the weekends and just regular drunk (wetf that is) the rest of the time at 19 years old is too much drinking. Then realize it's too much at any age. "I can stop anytime I want" is exactly what people who are denying their abuse of alcohol say. I'd have laid out the exact same ultimatum as your (soon to be ex) gf. What you should do is stop getting drunk every week. Or tell your gf you're not going to stop and she can't make you so you're breaking up. Pretty easy math here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're mad at themselves, not you, but they'll probably never see that. You're fine. There's nothing you can do. Next time you're around them maybe say something like, "I'm sad you two can't be happy for us and all the work we do to make the life we have. That makes me very sad. I'd like to think if our roles were reversed I'd be happy and proud of my brother and sister in law. I hope one day you both find peace over it, but in the meantime I'm asking that the snide comments stop. I want to enjoy time with my family, all of you, and I can't do that if you're both making derogatory comments about my choices in life."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're being smart. So smart. You never truly know someone until you've lived with them for a year, at minimum. "I don't want to do wife things unless"...idek what that means, but it's not the first time I've heard it come out of 20-something mouths of women. I feel like if a person wants a relationship they'll engage in one. Women who hold affection hostage for demands of a label arent looking for a relationship. That's scorekeeping and scorecards have no place in a healthy relationship. You might want to rethink marrying this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;He seemed happy with the touches apart from every time I mention that he left the toilet seat up, left a cup on the table , had been drinking too much a particular week, hasn #8217;t called someone to fix something or not done something (basically nags that most boyfriends get). If you're their mother I guess that's normal. I date adults and let them handle their own lives. Yeah, it comes off as controlling. Nagging is controlling. Don't nag.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chore chart. Both of you sit down and make a list of what needs done. Then both of you pick out the stuff that doesn't bother you to do AND the stuff you *hate* to do. Work it out from there. My husband and I had to do this when we first moved in together. He hates bathrooms, I don't mind doing them. I hate dishes, he doesn't mind doing them, etc. Figure it out; what days for what chore and who's responsible. No nagging needed. It's in black and white. Today's Friday, so it's his turn to do the litter box and your turn to dust.</TEXT>

It's your mom's. When you catch yourself thinking "omg he didn't properly clean the fucking litter box *again*" ask yourself why it matters to you. (Assuming, of course, that his job is done well enough for the cat and it's actually clean.) Not in a shitty way, just be curious about it. Fix it if you have to in order to quiet your anxiety, but approach your discomfort with curiosity. Ask it some questions. Keep asking. It will answer you eventually and then you can put it to rest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive had male managers ask me why I needed the bathroom so much. I was entirely blunt even if they were joking. No sir, not on my damn watch. Once a woman got up from her desk and the floor mgr loudly asked her where she thought she was going. He always questioned the women when they got up (I wasn't on his team). She was sick of his shit and loud as you please said, "I've got to change my tampon. Is that ok with you?" He never asked another woman leaving her desk for a bathroom break a damn thing after that. It's that kind of stuff. I've worked in a lot of different industries. I can say I didn't run into that kind of thing working retail. It was food service and low-level office job industry I saw that kind of thing in. Just be aware of it and that, at some point in your professional life, it's gonna be an issue in your immediate purview. Be ready to make it a non-issue real fast if necessary. You'll save yourself so much anxiety.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love your username  #128514; I had a best friend in my 20s who was dxd with schizophrenia. It changed him so much and it was scary to witness. He didn't want to take his meds because he believed that his parents and drs were trying to poison him. It broke my heart watching him struggle. He eventually ended up in jail for assaulting his grandmother and I list touch with him after that. I felt awful about not staying in touch. It seems like such a scary illness and I truly admire y'all who have some insight to it. I can't but imagine how tricky it makes navigating life. I have severe ADD and depression/anxiety. Those three things can make my own internal life pure hell. IOW, I think you're basically a hero.</TEXT>

The next day the neighbors came down to holler at me about it. I told him I didn't GAF how they lived their lives but the walks and floor are very thin and I work so I need to sleep. I further told him I wasn't dragging my ass out if bed and getting dressed at 2am to politely ask them to have the consideration for their neighbors they should already possess. That was the last conversation we ever had about it and the music and fighting stopped. It's hell living like that and I hope y'all can GTFO quick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first thing I notice is the range of value in this photo. You have a great one. A full range if light and dark. The second thing I noticed was the contrast. It's nice too. Where I think you could improve is your composition. You've got your subject dead center and the image is bisected by the waterline. Next time you compose try visualizing the golden ratio or rule of threes (if you don't know wtf i'm talking about Google is your authority here) and arranging your subject in one of the "sweet" spots. If you're taking an image with a lot of light and dark you want to very slightly underexpose by metering the lightest spot in the frame. On most phones you can just tap the lightest area and it will meter itself. This will keep you from losing detail. You can pull details out of underexposed areas but over exposed area are lost forever. Oh, to reduce noise try shooting landscapes at 100 ISO. You need a fair bit of light or a very steady hand to shoot so slowly but you'll eliminate almost all the excess noise. Learning the manual functions on your phone's camera will open up vast resources to better images.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does she need reassurance that this has an end or do you? It *does* have an end. Heartbreak isn't any easier in polyamory than it is in monogamy. Grieve. Trust your wife that she's there for you. It's ok to be sad. If you get sick of "sad" sit down with your wife and watch something stupidly funny. You can give yourself a break that way. Another tip: write. Write the person. Write everything you want to say but wouldn't ever actually say. Revise it a hundred times until it's perfect. Decide if you want to send it. If you do, sleep on it for 24 hrs. If you still want to send it you're not done writing it. Write it until you don't want to send it. It's astonishingly therapeutic.</TEXT>

They didn't have the power you thought they did. It was always just an act. The second step is to get comfortable in your own skin. You're not there yet or this wouldn't still have such power over you. You get there by finding something you like about yourself. You admire it for weeks, months. You admire it until you truly like that part if yourself. Then you pick something else and learn to like it too. Eventually you realize you're actually pretty great and they're actually really pathetic and sad. Therapy is the fastest path.

    <TEXT>Equal time is impossible. She can't do it. The best you can all hope for is an equitible time split. The difference is subtle but important. A true 50/50 split of time will make all of you crazy trying to discern what's "equal". And you'll find you can't do it. Equality is "you get 5 days and then you get 5 days and nothing will alter that because it's equal and fair". Except...what if you're with partner A during your "partner A 5 days" and partner Bs father dies? Do you say "too bad, this is A's time" or do you tell A that B needs you right now and you'll have to cut the time short? Equality demands you say "too bad" to B. Equitable time division sends you to the one most in need. If you're having trouble adjusting to not having her some nights google "the most skipped step". You'll find an article that talks about this very thing and ways to create a healthier dynamic.</TEXT>

In fact, any small crack, any tiny fissure will be magnified and become less manageable and more prone to breaking the relationship entirely. Even happily married couples who go from mono to the poly route have tall hurdles to overcome. Hi! First hand experience speaking. My husband and I have a terrific marriage. We genuinely care about and respect one another. Polyamory has been GREAT for our marriage but we were already in a very solid place. Polyamory *still* raised some big issues we weren't aware of. If we hadn't started out on such a solid foundation our marriage would have ended months ago. No one should look at any form of ethical non-monogamy as any sort of solution to any marital issues. It's not. It's the complete opposite.</TEXT>

What, exactly, do I need in order to cut a piece of rock and then make it into a cab? A specialized rock saw (or can I convert a mitre saw somehow?) and a lap machine or do I need a full cab machine? Can any of this be done with a dremel? I'm irked I haven't been able to find this info on my own so I hope y'all will have some compassion for such basic as hell questions. Much thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I found glasswork and it was like finding religion. I already had a bead business making polymer clay beads I sold in local shops. I knew my bff would love glass work as much as I did. Plus she's a skilled woodworker. She turned out gorgeous beads and boxes from the jump. My business lasted 3 more years after I brought her on. tl;dr don't go into business with your bff ever, ever. We're still bff's, but we nearly weren't over this. I miss it, but I worked with borosilicate glass and that stuff is not cheap to have as a hobby. So yeah, I consider buying another kiln and torch every so often, but right now I'm really wanting to get into lapidary. I'll probably sell a spinning wheel and a few other bits of equipment I don't use to pay for my next creative venture. (Worked in fiber for about 9 years. I have many interests lol)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's awesome! Another thing that may help: "exercise" is a 4-letter word for most overweight people. It has horrible, deep seated connotations for them. But brains can be tricked. I don't exercise, I go for bike rides with my camera and take pics. The fact I end up cycling 20+ miles is just a side effect. Kayaking and hiking are the same thing for me; photo ops, not exercise. It makes a HUGE difference. If you can help her "trick" her brain into not seeing physical activity as exercise you can get her moving. And if you can get her moving healthier eating is just a natural consequence. It works in reverse too. If you can change her eating habits the desire for physical activity will increase as a natural consequence. There have been studies done that show these things affect one another and how we view them in our brain. Try to affect really small changes at first. They build on one another. I didn't start out cycling 20 miles. I started out cycling 3 miles and puking my guts out afterwards lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You feel bad because of two reasons: 1. You "tested" your bf. It's a passive aggressive, shitty way to engage in a relationship. Even if he'd rated you highly you'd still feel icky about it. 2. You asked your partner to evaluate your art. Don't do this. "What do you think?" is fine, *if* he's genuinely interested in reading it. Otherwise? Find a writing group for that. Couple final things because I know that was harsh and I am a writer (fiction mostly, but poetry too) and have been where you are. You're a brand new baby poet. We don't expect babies to run marathons. Cut yourself some slack. It's truly ok to suck. Even if we're proud of what we did initially. Sucking is a chance to improve. Writing, especially poetry, will require you to grow a thick skin. Any creative endeavor will because everyone's a critic. Praise does come, but it comes after a lot of "this is a boring word" and "this phrasing is clumsy" and "no, you'll have to start over entirely none of this is working" from your peers, teachers, and mentors. Notice your partner isn't in that list. That's because partners make lousy critics.</TEXT>

I'm still laughing. I'm a writer and he doesn't have a clue. No publisher offers critiques. You get that from your peer group. All a publisher will do, if you're lucky, is send you a boilerplate rejection but usually you don't hear anything unless your work is pretty much ready for the press AND they believe it will sell. Those are some damn slim odds for anyone, but especially a neophyte. Publishers don't critique. Publishers don't edit. Publishers expect you to have all that already taken care of.

    <TEXT>I don't think you're overreacting. I think you need to reframe this. This kind of tells you a lot:  gt;If he explained that there was no attachment to the woman they came from and smelling dirty shoes was vital to feel sexually fulfilled in life I might have been able to work on that. But instead he lied. Fetishes often come with shame and guilt. People are embarrassed to have them, feel guilty for indulging in them, are ashamed to talk to their partner for fear of disgust and rejection. Looking at it, a foot fetish is perhaps nonsensical or silly to a great many, but pretty harmless and benign. (Honestly this is true of most of them.) The actuality of it doesn't warrant the shame that comes with it. But society puts that shame there in a million different ways. If that shame, that fear, hadn't been present he likely would have said exactly that. Consider how you reacted the first time you learned of his fetish. The first time you discovered shoes. I'm not blaming you for anything *at all*. But looking back you may get additional perspective on why this has turned into such a problem between you two. He doesn't hide *because* he's a liar. He hides because he's afraid.</TEXT>

I know the whole "sniff beneath doors for a week" thing is really popular but I've had cats my whole life and it only ever extended any stressful times for the cats *and* the people. Cats are cats. They know how to be cats on an expert level and don't require human intervention to do it well. Let them work it out unless there's blood. It takes days instead of weeks when you do this. tl;dr stop trying to make an adjustment work and just let it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't say the opinion of experts doesn't matter. I said opinions are just opinions. As a creative I take what works from the critics and leave the rest behind. Opinions, no matter who they're from, have to be taken in the context in which they were written; by a fallible human being with their own complicated psychology. There can be both value and trash in such a thing. Without discernment of that context opinions are, in fact, pretty worthless.</TEXT>

I was the poly one in our marriage and still struggled really hard when my husband went on his first date, first overnight, and first vacation. Those firsts can be prickly. It's ok. It goes away if you can get it to answer enough questions. Our desire is to turn away from pain. Turn into it instead. Look it in the eye. Find out what it's made of. I thought I'd be soooo relaxed and shit when my husband started dating but those first few dates found no relaxation for me. Instead I used those times to work on myself. It was already uncomfortable so why not embrace and go with that? It worked well for me. I hope something of this is helpful.</TEXT>

Tell your bf to suck it up and try unclenching his anus just a tiny bit. Do you, enjoy the hell out of life openly.</TEXT>

Learning to draw is what you say you want, but you already know how (handwriting is drawing). What you don't know how to do is see like an artist. The book "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" is an excellent way to accomplish that. Once you can see like an artist you can paint, draw, sketch with any tools.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So...you're putting a really big order in for yourself to fill. One you can't. She'll never be comfortable with sex or the topics around it until she deals with her trauma. Until she feels entirely in control in a sexual situation she will keep retraumatizing herself because no matter how much control a partner gives them they'll never feel empowered enough to take it. The very best thing you can do is encourage her to get trauma therapy and tell her you won't even consider engaging in sexual activity with her until she has healed from her trauma and tell her, sincerely, that you're excited to grow the relationship while she focuses on healing. Pass along RAINN's info. She doesn't have to see a therapist to talk to a support network now, but she really has to talk to someone. rainn.org</TEXT>

If one person *thinks* there's a problem with the relationship, well, that's a problem. In the relationship. If she doesn't want to work on it there's no point in you trying to save this relationship. It's over as soon as one person gives up. Sounds like she's there.</TEXT>

You obviously can't make someone do anything but my story might help convince her. I didn't seek help for 27 years and doing that nearly ended my life. That shit doesn't ever go away. It sleeps and when a person starts to feel a little stable it will come back with a vengeance. It was one of the most awful experiences of my life. It was as if every assault I'd ever experienced had just occurred all at once. I nearly had to be hospitalized and it took me a year to get back to normal. She does not want to do that to herself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so tell yourself that you're taking a break from thinking about how your life isn't the way you want it to be. Then remind yourself of it when you forget and start thinking about your debt and life and malcontent and feeling stuck and...just stop when you catch yourself and give yourself a reminder (hey, we're not supposed to be thinking about this), then go read book reviews or window shop for shoes online. Whatever, you're just not allowed to dwell on your shit. When you find a little peace over it start thinking about yourself. When you were little what was your crazy dream? To be a ballerina? A contract killer? A painter? Irreverent greeting card writer? Whatever it is guage your interest in it now. I bet it's still there. If it's not, or there's something else calling you try dabbling. There are all kinds of free groups and reference materials online to learn the basics from. While all of this is going on look back at your degree program. Was any part of it interesting for you? At your job now are there any opportunities to use the stuff you know or love to do? Can you find a job doing something that builds on your degree and your interest? Maybe the mob needs a private site for its hitmen. Who knows? The possibilities are endless. The whole point here is that until you find a path you're going to feel miserable and like you're lagging behind. Careers can be fun, but so is life as a jack of all trades. I've done both and find benefits and drawbacks to each. Lay off on the pressure you're putting on yourself. Life's not perfect and it's ok to not have a damn clue. I got my undergrad in animation only to discover I hate to draw. It was an expensive way to figure that out. But, what can you do? Nothing except try to find your fulfillment while you grind for your peanuts and bleed for the student loan sharks each month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bad idea to fix most issues. Ok for strictly sexual issues sometines, but be aware you can't help feelings. They're going to happen at some point. Before you do anything *both* of you sit down and read at least one whole-ass book on the topic together. Take your time. Talk about what you're reading within the confines of your relationship. If there are at all any trust issues or other problems other than ED *do not do this*. Not unless you want to blow up your entire marriage. Opening the relationship is like having a baby; alllll those relationship stresses and problems get way, way bigger all of a sudden. Been with my husband 20 years and we're happily polyamorous.

    <TEXT>This is where the hard internal, personal work comes in in polyamory. Your feelings are uncomfortable and our default position is to turn away from the discomfort; to make it stop and trying to ignore it can be really tempting. Try something else instead, turn into the pain, stare it down, ask it some questions. Eventually it will tell you exactly what it's made of and then the dismantling can begin. A good technique is to write down whatever thought is troubling you then beneath that write "why is this true?" and answer it. You'll override your emotional brain with your logical one as soon as you start trying to make emotion match fact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you go from "hmm, I'm interested in exploring this with you" to "I'm already chatting up guys" without educating yourselves on what, exactly, you're getting into yeah, you're screwed. You can't just open a monogamous relationship and expect it to work. And if it's being done due to any issue in the relationship you're definitely doomed. Non-monogamy is not a fix for a broken relationship anymore than having a baby is. Same effect to the relationship; all your problems are going to feel 10x bigger and the problems you weren't aware of will rear their ugly heads. It's a huge stressor on a relationship. Enormous. If you're not already starting from a place of stability, communication, and education you might as well hang it up now. Save yourself the heartache.</TEXT>

You figure out how to fit the creative stuff around the paying stuff until the creative stuff pays. It sucks so very much, but it's necessary, and bonus! Being out in public among people or working with others will inform his creative work and give it depth. Without that he's essentially working in a vacuum and no one learns anything doing that. His work will get stale pretty quickly only he won't be able to see it. Creative work requires experience in everyday life if you want an audience to connect to.

    <TEXT>"often"? Sure, I guess I see a lot of people looking at it that way. I know of few who try to fix their relationship that practice it and none who have done so successfully. It does as much good as having a baby when it comes to relationship repair. My husband and I did after 16 years of monogamy. But our relationship was already on very solid footing too. I never would have approached the idea otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;know our situation isn #8217;t exactly common. I #8217;m looking for advice on how to go about even starting this journey. It is unbelievably common. So common it has a name -- "unicorn hunting". And you're not going to like my answer. What you're looking for is called a unicorn; that one perfect "third" to add to your great marriage. Someone who will love and want you both. A complete fantasy. People are individuals, not marital accessories. You don't "add" someone to an already established relationship. You create a brand new relationship between the three of you. It's a whole new dynamic, only instead of just you two (A  amp; B) there's now C too. That 3 new dynamics; A\B, A\C, B\C, plus the dynamic between the three of you. So 4. Four new dynamics to figure out. That's assuming the woman you "pick" is even at all attracted to or interested in your spouse. What's going to happen if you fall hard for a woman and she can't stand your husband? Or if you fall hard but they end up head over heels? There are so many ways to fuck yourself, and two others, here. You're going to want to tread very carefully and with a lot of mindfulness. This kind of things works out ok sometimes when it just happens organically. Trying to force or create it will blow up in your face.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh it'll still be an uncomfortable landscape. I'm the hinge in a V shaped relationship. They've been friends longer than I've been with my husband (18+ yrs). I live with my husband half the time and my other partner the rest. We're all big, big communicators and love each other a ton but this has still been a very tricky path to walk. One we've all considered giving up on at one time or another. The unknowns will trip you up every time and there are so many.</TEXT>

In fact I've got commies in the funhouse right now and yesterday accidentally left my used (wrapped) pad on my other partner's bathroom sink. He texted me asking if I wanted him to save it for later. *I* was grossed out that I'd forgotten it, but he thought it was adorable and hilarious. Is it messy? Yep. But it's literally just blood. And it's every month. He needs to ovary up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Entirely depends on where you live. My partners and I live in a place with a very low cost of living, but the work they both do tends to pay six-figure salaries and most companies that deal in that stuff are located in an area with a very high cost of living. The end result is that while they both make decent money to survive in a large metro area they make more than enough to survive in the rural area in which we live. How much is that? Well, it's a lot, none of us are retiring early, but we don't really look at our checking account or the price of things much. Now, we're also all well into middle age and we have definitely paid our dues wrt living broke so we feel like we earned every bit of it.</TEXT>

A marriage counselor will guide you both out. Communication stumbles are really common in relationships, any kind, and the emotion and lack of objectivity can make it impossible to figure out no matter how understanding you both try to be. It's a really damn good sign he's amenable to counseling. If you both go in open and curious you'll get more out if it than you expect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So part of depression is being sure you've got a handle on it when you so clearly don't. He needs a kick in the ass. "If you don't make an appointment I'm staying in a hotel until you do" if he thinks therapy is expensive... I mean, trying to make him laugh is great, but letting him tell you he's fine when you've found him sobbing on the bed cannot slide. That shit needs head on addressing. No beating around the bush. "You are miserable. You are not even close to 'fine'. You must get some kind of help. I need you to change something in your life because I am scared. This issue is driving a wedge between us and I hate it. Please help me fix this." Maybe all he really needs is someone to take that first step. Making an appointment is a staggeringly overwhelming task when you're depressed. Offer to make it for him.</TEXT>

Doesn't make the first therapist bad, just means the therapy wasn't what that person needed.

I knew she wasn't for me on the first visit. The two after that have both been very good at their jobs but I got something different from both of them and the second, my current therapist, has been incredibly successful where the first wasn't. He wasn't a bad therapist, he just didn't have exactly what I needed. Trust your judgment. If you go in and feel comfortable and at ease you know you have a winner and will get benefit.</TEXT>

You're probably not that important to them. That sounds kind of shitty, but I mean it. They'd have to have some kind of emotional investment in you to plot as a group to manipulate you into going for a walk. Unless you work with severely bored children I doubt this was ever a discussion. More likely one of them last week said, "jesus covid has caused me to gain 10lbs. I'm going to start walking at lunch. Who's in?" and the other two were like "yeah! Great idea!" and when you came back from vacation they wanted to let you know you were not excluded and the invitation was open to you as well. That's my take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think anyone at all would laugh. Frankly, I hate exercise. But I love photography. There are some outstanding photo ops to be found hiking and biking. The first time I went out I biked 3 mile and puked. No one laughed. I got high fives. Couple years later I was cycling 20+ miles every morning. It was never exercise, it was photo scouting. I kept wanting to see what was around the next corner. My point is that no one who is an actual human being is going to laugh if you go for a walk. Not even if you puke at the end of it. If anyone does laugh or make fun you know right then that is a miserable person who hates themselves. The thing we criticize in others tends to be the thing we most hate about ourselves. IOW, anyone ridiculing you is just holding up a mirror. What a miserable way to live, huh? Do you and do it unapologetically. *If* you want to go for a walk with them, go. If not, don't. But don't let your assumptions paint a false picture for you to fixate on. Anxiety is a smooth liar.</TEXT>

They're terrifying and big enough to take the shoe from you. We caught one one night and fed it to her tarantula. It crunched when her fangs went through. We squealed like scared little girls pretty much from the time we caught it until it was over. Then we laughed liked idiots and lit another joint. Good times.

There is, however, something very wrong with a partner who will share details about his feelings wrt others with their partner who is deeply hurt knowing such things. There's a lot wrong with that.

    <TEXT>So he knew it was wrong to do and still did it. Huh. Something to think on, maybe. Someone who is inherently non-monogamous can't truly be happy in a long term monogamous relationship. The inverse is also true: an inherently monogamous person can't be happy in a life of non-monogamy. I say this with a caveat: there are some couples who manage this, but the monogamous person tends to be very stable and comfortable in their own skin. Anyone else is going to find themselves sinking fast in such a relationship. It will remain hard for you. Being ok with a polyamorous relationship demands a measure of very difficult internal work from a monogamous person. It's painful and will change the way you look at relationships. But if you truly want to try to be ok with this ask your bf to read a book with you on it. Doesn't matter which one. Set a schedule to talk about it as you both read. Ask lots of questions as they come up. Consider, and talk about, how it might look in your relationship. Give yourself time. ask your partner for time. Ask him to stop sharing with you, to put some brakes on until you've at least gotten through the book. If you learn about it your fear of it may find a harder time getting a foothold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow. Says a lot about him that 1) he thinks such a thing is ridiculous and 2) that no one has ever asked him for one. Maybe secondhand embarrassment might be as far as I'd go feelings-wise. People tell on themselves all the time and don't realize it. All that comment did was show his own ignorance and medicrity as an educator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is this behavior acceptable to you? I wouldn't let a stranger talk to me like that and I bet your partner wouldn't either nor would they talk to a stranger like that. If you can't treat your partner with the respect your grant a stranger then there's something the hell wrong with you. If this isn't acceptable to you then set a boundary. Refuse to sit and listen. Get up and walk away at the first name. You can try again when everyone's calm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This. Is. YOUR. Child. Be rude. Tell MIL "oh, shut up, Susan" and "no, I'm holding my child now. I said NO. Do I need to draw a diagram? It's just 2 letters." But most importantly you tell them all that this is your house and your child and you will decide what's ok and what's not and if they're upset well they can die mad about it because it's. YOUR. Child. and you make the decisions. Tell your husband since he won't find the balls to maintain decent boundaries around your child then you will. You and the kids can leave if no one will listen. Just get up and go. Be rude. This is when it's called for. Women need to stop being nice. In a marriage you manage your family and he manages his. He's not managing his because he's afraid of them. You either have to put your damn foot down and piss everyone off for a little while or feel like you're getting steamrolled the rest of your life because you will be. What life for you and your son do you want? One where he watches his mother roll over and show her belly or one where he knows mama has teeth?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What do you think will happen if he doesn't change these things? You'll be uncomfortable and then what? He sleeps late and you get anxious and say nothing and he's still sleeping. Not answering your texts or calls, your boy is out cold. What does your anxiety tell you is about to happen? That you'll find him dead? Does that happen? Healthy 26yo men just dying in their sleep? How realistic is the story your anxiety is telling you? Compare the anxiety story to real life evidence. Healthy 26yos do not just die in their sleep. We seek to control external things when we feel out of control internally. It's a shitty trick our brains play on us because worrying about something you can't change just exacerbates anxiety. That all stops for the most part when you get comfortable in your own skin and have a clear sense of who you are as a person. Not who everyone wants you to be, not who you think you have to be, but who you truly are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and I are polyamorous. I'm also a writer and working on a piece now about this very attitude. There are some polyamorous folks out there who act like polyamory is THE ONE TRUE WAY to have a relationship. But that's nonsense. A healthy relationship can exist in any structure and not everyone is suited to non-monogamy. Anyone who can't stop telling you how _____ they are is telling on themselves. Anyone consistently talking about how rich, smart, happy, good in bed, etc they are isn't that thing at all. They'd like to be, but people tell on themselves all the time like this. Polyamory is great. For me and my husband. It takes a specific kind of person to live this way and anyone pushing it on others isn't that kind of person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You need an endocrinologist. Depending on insurance you may need a referral to one, but ultimately that's where you want to land if your hormones are out of whack. Barring that find an internist. A gynecologist or general practitioner will just put you on bc pills if they determine you have a hormone issue. It's not a solution it's a bandaid. Ok for a bit but ultimately you want to solve the problem and not just the symptoms.</TEXT>

You're his partner, not his mother, and despite what you may have seen modeled growing up doing all the shit isn't a privilege, it's indentured servitude.

He said that he respected my feeling but that it felt like an ultimatum and that I didn't trust him to assess the risk/situation and make the right call. It's not an ultimatum, it's a boundary. A healthy one. If he sleeps with someone so young you will not be comfortable sleeping with him. You're not telling him what to do. You're telling him what *you'll* do. Big big difference. The fact he's trying to turn this into a control issue when it so clearly is not tells me he lacks the maturity to know what's appropriate. For me? This would be a big, big problem.</TEXT>

What a great time to try hang gliding or basket weaving or whatever your latent interest is. Also consider you may just be more naturally introverted than he is. That's not anything that needs changing unless you want to change it. Your bf sounds comfortable in his own skin and that can be a painful thing to witness when we want it ourselves but can't realize it. You can get there too. Start by thinking about who you are. Not who you think you need to be, but who you truly are. I promise you you're absolute treasure in your own right. Figure that out on a fundamental level and your jealousy will evaporate.</TEXT>

I'm not sure why you think you have insight into her partners' activities. That's odd. I also can't speak for anyone else here but gender has no basis in my take on this kind of situation.

    <DATE>2020-10-18 16:29:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>A friend of mine lived in a pretty big neighborhood with a pretty strict HOA. He was the first house at the bottom of the hill that you saw when you drive in. He asked and was allowed to add a garage on to his house and did so, siding it with cedar planks. It looked great. His HOA disagreed and told him the by laws state all exposed walls must be painted. He tried to appeal but was shot down unanimously. So he checked the by laws further and found that while it was stated that all exposed walls must be painted, there was absolutely no mention of any color restrictions. By the time he was done each plank was a different primary color and there was nothing they could do about it. They were furious with him and he laughed his ass off. Edit: this blew up. I didn't think it was all that interesting, just a story of a guy I used to know. To answer a few questions/comments: This was back in the early 90s. The HOA was created years after the neighborhood had been established. Maybe they assumed no one would use anything but tasteful colors. IDK and don't care. I also don't care if you believe the story or not. Using a clear coat/wood-like finish would defeat the purpose of his giant fuck you to the whole neighborhood. I said he was a friend but that's not quite true. He was some guy I knew through a boyfriend and hung around a lot. He took great joy in being an equal opportunity dick.</TEXT>
