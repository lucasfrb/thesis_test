    <TEXT>The thing with Valverde is he is trying to keep playing Griezmann at the left wing even when suarez is injured, with the hope that the more griezmann plays there more likely he is to adapt to that position. Because it's very clear that once Suarez returns, he will start as the center forward for sure. Valverde also prefers having griezmann in the wing owing to his defensive contribution. But the worrying thing is this is exactly what we saw with Coutinho. He kept playing him in the left winger position although it was very clear that Coutinho's qualities weren't best suited to play there. What we ultimately saw was not a smoother adaptation to the newer position but an absolute horrible patch of form for Coutinho, which brought his confidence down to an absolute low. I hope the same does not happen with Griezmann. Valverde's obsession with including all of the forwards in the eleven without the ability to take hard calls can ruin the potential Griezmann has and make this another season where we are heavily dependant on Messi for all attacking plays, instead of all the forwards playing to their best potential at their most suited positions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thing is football as a whole is changing to a more physical form, which is not best suited to this barcelona team. This is often confused with lower commitment levels and lack of work ethic by the fans, which is not necessarily the case. It's just that some players like busquets, rakitic, roberto, pique, etc. are not the best when it comes to facing physical teams like Liverpool and such leading them to commiting mistakes. But what we should realise is that we should not blindly question their work ethic or desire to perform. They are champion professionals who try to give their best every time they step on the pitch. What messi is stating is that there is no need to give fuel to all the bad rep these players already have regarding their ethic. And I am pretty sure if Abidal had directly confronted the players he doubts and worked through things, it would have had a much more desirable effect than creating controversy in the press and spreading rumors about the time under Valverde.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the same pattern again and again. Our whole creative outlet from the left wing is Alba. We do not have a single player in the unit who can run at defences at top speed. All the attacks are built through messi, mark him continuously, foul him when he runs, block and Mark the alba messi passing lane and we are done for. All this possession and so few chances created. One mistake and it's all over. The same thing keeps happening</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, don't be overwhelmed with the task at hand. Troubling yourself with questions like whether I can finish it or not won't help. Any amount of hard work will take you closer to your goal. 81 days is a lot. Firstly, figure out what are the easier sections to study, something you might enjoy going through. This will help you in gaining momentum. Make sure that you keep your motivation level high and don'tt get burnt out. As you get into the groove of studying, try tackling the tougher sections. Make a schedule to try and manage all your subjects in a way that you don't get bored. Hope this helps and all the best</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just as fat people shouldn't feel entitled to be found attractive they do not deserve to be bullied due to their physical appearance as well. What you think as a random demand for appreciation and validation is something that stems from years of being looked down upon and mistreated for something they themselves feel a lot of shame about. My point is the general fat population doesn't want your appreciation and adulation, just acceptance. But I do agree that there are many cases in such situations where you sense a certain level of entitlement, but I do get where thet they are coming from</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just sit down and start chipping away at the proverbial wood. At the end of the day it's all you can do. I get that you are not a 100% invested in this course but you yourself have the reasons listed down, why you want to complete it. You just have to start working on it. Try breaking down the study material into chunks. Read up concepts, and look up practical uses and applications on the internet if it helps you understand better. Solve problems, look at the solved examples and just try your best. Create a balance in your overall life and give time to things you like doing. Don't make your studies about deriving pleasure, that can be done elsewhere. Maybe a reward system would work well for you here. Set realistic targets and indulge in things you enjoy once you achieve them. Cheers and best of luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For most people there morality and law abiding nature comes before making money. You have to remember Skylar was herself pregnant when Walt got around to cooking meth. He became distant, stopped spending time with her, and was clearly lying. How do you think any pregnant woman who is herself going through a lot of physical, hormonal and emotional changes would feel if her beloved husband showed this rapid change? Walt acting shady all with the Jesse pinkman association, his second cell phone and fugue state only widened the gap in their relationship. And when she realised Walt was making drugs it challenged her sense of morality. You have to remember her sister's husband was in the DEA. So they were not exactly people who had much sympathy for drug dealers and people of that world . Then what makes you think she would so readily accept her own husband getting into that line of business.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He is a weird character for sure. I think that's what makes him so evil, his unassuming nature when carrying out horrible deeds. He maybe feels bad for people when they are dead, because of some weird fascination or attachment he feels. But I think he treats the action of murder as something as common and mundane as say brushing your teeth in the morning, or taking a shower. It's something that must be done when necessary. No second thoughts. This is where Vince Gilligan and his writers really distinguish themselves from their peers. They manage to provide us with such a character even after giving us villains and anti heroes of the highest order throughout the first 4 seasons</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I myself re-watched the show a second time and finished it last week. Well I had the exact same experience as you had. I started noticing how poorly Walt treats Jesse and was such an asshole from the very get go. I think it has to do with the brilliant writing by Vince Gilligan and his team of writers. What they managed to do with Walt was they made us relate to him by making him an underdog. As with most people in life Walt was someone who had not lived to his full potential, someone who had been taken for granted by his family and peers alike, someone who had been always underrated. This immediately made us feel a connect to Walt. As a result, everytime Walt's ego was punctured, everytime he was insulted or considered a helpless chicken of a man by his family, friends, we felt it. We therefore turned a blind eye to the selfishness and monster pride and egocentric nature that was at the core of Walt's every bad decision. He manipulated and ill treated a naive and somewhat dim kid like Jesse and we went along with it because we had initially invested so much to the character. Only as the show went on and we realised Walt's true colors did we start to see the whole picture. So when we rewatch the show we already know Walt for who he truly is. We have lost the initial connect formed with him when watching s1 fir the first time. We know what this guy has done to Jesse and everyone around him. This is why I think Breaking Bad is the absolute pinnacle of any example for ego and pride blinding the sense of right ot wrong. We ourselves as the audience were guilty of it during our first watch.</TEXT>
