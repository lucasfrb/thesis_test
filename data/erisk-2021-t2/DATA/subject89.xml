    <TITLE>Planning to switch: thoughts.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-27 13:37:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I plan on switching to the Moto Z Play coming week. I had a very long time of doubting between the HTC 10, Sony XZ and even iPhone 7 but kind of settled on the Moto X Play due to its price (I can get it for 216 euro) without offering up too much performance. But before I buy I wanted to ask you guys to be honest and tell me some issues you have had with the phone. Especially since I have to use it for 2 years minimum. I come from the LG G3.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Latitude e7450 housing problems.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-12 09:48:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>For a couple of months I have a E7450 and I am really happy with its performance, the only major problem I have with this computer is the fact that the housing clicks when I rest my palms on it. When I tap anywhere on the keyboard side of the laptop I can hear it "click" to the right of the keyboard. It seems like the housing of the laptop is a little loose, especially on the right side, as it also clicks under the palmrests. Is there someone who can give me a tip as to how to solve this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Critroni ransomware, need help!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-21 13:58:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today Windows Defender notified me that there was malware on my PC so I ran both Malware Anti Malwarebytes and Defender. MAWB came back clean but WD said, after a full scan, that there was Critroni on my pc. According to the path it was already on my C: drive but it originated from both my external HD's in the form of a .zip and .exe. After the scan ran I order WD to delete the file. After that I backed up my most precious files to OneDrive and rebooted my system. After reboot everything seems normal. But, my question now is, how safe is it for me to assume that everything is gone, or could it be a timebomb kind of thing? I backed up my files on one of the HD's but since it also came from these drives I'm not sure if this is sufficient. Both MAWB and WD come back clean now. Can someone help me?</TEXT>

Does anybody have any more tips or suggestions to resolve this issue or should I claim warranty?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-06-02 17:23:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>This afternoon my dad called me that his one year license to office 2016 was expired. I adviced him to buy a new license and so he did. We installed his new Home version and booted it. Almost immediately we got a notification that office couldn't be activated. I found out that the old key for the pro version was still added to the account which seemed like the source of the problem to me. We removed all the offices using a tool from Microsoft. And reinstalled the new version. This did nothing, it still shows two licenses and neither of them can be activated. What can or should I do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>High temps? Thermal paste replacement?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-17 16:52:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a 1,5 year old Latitude E7450 with i5-5300. When using Chrome, having some applications open (Spotify, PDf reader, word etc) the CPU temp is between 45-50 degrees Celcius according to Speccy. And when playing aoe 2 the temps go up into the high 70's. Is this to high? Do I have to replace the thermal paste or are these temps no problem? I am a bit hesitant to replace the paste as I have not yet found a good guide for replacing it and I have no experience doing this. It would be great if someone could offer some advice and/or link me to a good thermal paste replacement guide.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-10 14:13:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I go to a gym on a business park and close to the gym is a small business which is only open upon request. They make hand made tables and stuff. But, for some reason Maps seems to pull all the info from local businesses to this one business. So when you look at pictures for this company it contains reviews for the Chinese restaurant, macdonalds and gym. Is there any way to resolve this? It is very frustrating as the reviews and pictures are incorrect and Maps always requests more information about the business (eventhough you are not there) and adds the place to your timeline.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>XZ2 1 week review</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-26 18:55:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have the xz2 for almost one week, coming from the moto z play, and I have couple of things to say for anyone who is interested in this phone. First of all the design. I really freaking love the design. When I saw the YouTube reviews I thought the phone to be a bit strange looking and not really pretty. But when I got the phone in hand for the first time I was really impressed. I have the black version and the phone feels amazing, especially the back. You can really feel and see this is a premium phone with a well thought out design. Secondly the phone is blazingly fast. The location of the fingerprint scanner is also pretty good if you rest your phone on your pinky, which I almost always do. What I don't really like thus far is the battery life which is notably worse compared to the z play. Secondly the design feels pretty vulnarable and requires a case. Thirdly the fingerprint sensor is not as reliable and is a bit slow. Overall it is a very good phone and I would recommend it for the price I paid for it which was 340 euro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys I just bought a Spartan Trainer two weeks ago.

    <TEXT>I picked up the Spartan Trainer because it offered the most bang for buck. I must say I did read a couple of reviews but I just entered the sportswatch/suunto arena when they started their transition to the Suunto App. Which was very disappointing to me. Although I do very much like the watch and in the end the app also offers pretty much everything I need to do with it. I exercise a few different sports which is something I really like about the Spartan trainer, for not a lot of money you get good battery life, a shit ton of sportsmodes and overall pretty ok daily activity tracking which I find fun. I also have been getting little more faith in Suunto that the app and whole software experience will get better this year.</TEXT>

Besides, if you are on Android now it requires a lot of investment for just a limited improvement, I would say. But in the end its up to you and i think the aw is very good albeit a bit expensive :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can recommend the Suunto Spartan Trainer, it was around 170 dollars I believe and does everything you want. You can also look into the Garmin 735 XT, which is a bit older but still good or the Polar Vantage M, which is also pretty good. Check out dcrainmaker.com if you want to read good in-depth reviews of any sportwatch, his site also has a comparison tool which I find very handy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Although I might understand you want to know exact numbers, it is not really usefull, if you want to use the numbers to see if you gain weight in muscle or fat you can use a electronic scale and just use the numbers as reference.

    <TEXT>I just did a nice exercise which resulted first in just one activity, but after a couple of minutes suddenly the activity got uploaded again to the Suunto app which now resulted in two times the same activity. In the expectation that I could delete one, I did so, but this resulted in both activities gone. The activity is still on my watch logbook but will not reappear in the Suunto app, what should I do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got my Trainer since a couple of months and Im pretty happy with it. The only thing I've come across is inaccurate HR readings. During zone 1 rides the heartrate will spike to  gt;200 for a couple of minutes which is just useless. Someone know how to fix this? I do wear in the recommended area and wash the watch after every session. Secondly im thinking about buying a seperate heartrate monitor, which is more accurate anyway. Can someone fill me in on how this works? You just connect the external HR meter everytime you want to use it? If i go to the gym I dont really plan on wearing a HR monitor.</TEXT>

The SA social aspect is funny if all your friends have suunto as well, but mine dont and I think the major part of sportswatch owners in fact own a Garmin. So now i have a app which i want to use for better metrics but also features a social aspect which im not interested in nor want, so I'd rather they improve and add other ways to analyze my training to the app instead of using developers time to enhance the social aspect, which to be honest will never take off.</TEXT>

It is not clear to me why you want to transfer? You say you have no interest in IB, why did you choose this bachelor to begin with and what do you want to study at University? You say that you cant afford University, to me it seems like you better find a different major at HU or another HBO instead of going the University route.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah but in the time i've had my suunto spartan trainer they did gradually added some features to the app, i think it will need some time but they will get there. the question is will you be willing to wait before they get there or no/are you content with the features now? garmin also has its issues of course :) grass is always greener etc.</TEXT>

I'm a guy who exercises a bit (around 6-7 hours a week) and I do strenght, cycling, swimming and running (not all at once) and for me the spartan trainer is the perfect watch for the money. The app-side is definitly not amazing but I think it will improve. If you are not happy and dont want to wait a couple of months i would jump ship (dont know if you miss specific features from garmin)</TEXT>

I was wondering if any of you have any tips or suggestions on how to polish these dents out? They are pretty deep. I now am rocking a case again but I hate how the phone feels in case compared to being naked. I also looked for skins but no-one seems to make skins for new sony phones..</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Discover Weekly vs Release Radar</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-09 13:50:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>After using Spotify for a couple of years daily I've noticed a pretty big difference between release radar and discover weekly. First of all discover weekly almost always features shit songs in my case. It is mostly acoustic versions of songs I normally listen to, which I really hate (the acoustic version). I'm also too lazy to actively moderate my Discover Weekly. The Release Radar on the other hand seems to feature pretty good songs in my opinion although it very often does not feature new songs by artists i 'subscribed' to, which is kinda strange. Is this common? Or do people have different opinions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hard to say, it depends on the system thats in the house, how warm you want it to be (i never set my heating higher than 19 degrees, but maybe thats too cold for you, sensitive to cold is subjective) and it depends on how big the room is where you are going to be working. I wouldnt recommend heating the whole house if you are just only working downstairs. Maybe contact a energy supply company and ask them for previous consumption at your adress, they have that info.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im not referring to your current consumption, thats useless. Your new place must have had previous owners who used heat; you can ask the energy supply company to provide you with their avarage use over the last/previous year, this will help you determine the amount you will have to pay. In fact: this is what the energy supply companies will use to determine your monthly payment. As mentioned in another post: your heating will probably be generated by natural gas, this is more expensive then electricity, so keep that in mind.</TEXT>

Secondly; its clear you can eat whatever you want, I just state that she would not say anything negative or be honest about that diet because thats how she earns her money, so people should be critical and aware of that. And yes, I dont really value anecdotal (you dont have to put it between quotation marks) evidence, I prefer more robust studies like systematic reviews, cohort studies or case studies and preferably over a longer period of time. Most of these studies show that a balanced diet is the healthiest way to go; so ill prefer that over some girl on the internet who earns her money by convincing people that she "healed" herself by eating meat and salt.</TEXT>

Veel van die crappy jaren 60 flatjes met schotelantennes zijn gesloopt en er staat nu veel gemixte nieuwbouw, de straten zijn mooier ed. Vind het er echt beter op geworden de laatste 10 jaar.</TEXT>

If you dislike it here so much, why wont you move to any of these places and enjoy yourself there? Seems like you are just punishing yourself and projecting it on the locals.

    <TEXT>I would advice against this. If you want to buy a house with the main aim to rent out, you wont get the same mortgage you would get if you would buy a house for yourself. This means you also have to bring more own money (from what I've read banks will finance up to 70 to 80%). And as said before you also have to keep in mind that you need to know your rights and obligations as a tenant, which are significant. I dont think its a smart idea to take out a loan to reinvest. I would as said before in this thread advise you to take the money you have and invest it somewhere in index funds for example.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; In addition to what others have said, buying a house vs an apt may be financially more sound anyway. Sometimes the VvE is a 100 or even more.. for an annuity of a 100 more you can buy a house that is 30-40k more expensive.. so you'd still have the same monthly costs but a better house. Sorry, but I think this is bad advice. The reason you pay to the VVE is so they can do large maintenance on the building. Its not like the money you pay for a VVE goes into a hole or something. Of course it is more a hassle compared to do it yourself because you have to get in agreement with the other members of the VVE, but still it isnt money thrown away. If you own a house without VVE you still have to set money aside for maintenance which is your own responsibility.</TEXT>

The chance that these two bibles have a high value is very low, due to the fact that these books were printed in large quantaties. They also have little to no archival value due to the fact that the bible is always the bible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True but according to DCRainmaker it does provide a extensive update to the watch: full on maps, navigation, music and payment (which Garmin all has), also: Google bought fitbit which means they are serious about WatchOS, lol. But, I do kinda understand their move but this is not the watch for people who traditionally liked Suunto, in my opinion.</TEXT>

Want je moet alsnog die wegenbelasting en verzekering betalen, of je nou de auto of de trein pakt.

    <TEXT>Comfort is leuk als je in de trein zit, maar goed dan moet je nog wel naar het station, hopen dat de treinen rijden (zeker in het weekend echt super vaak werkzaamheden/uitval gehad) of als je een keer wat moet meenemen wat groter is dan wat in een rugtas past is het leuk. Bovendien moet ik vaak vanaf het station dan nog lang wachten op overstappen op een volgende aansluiting van trein of bus (dit is natuurlijk verschillend per reis). Over het algemeen bespaar ik per enkele reis 0:30 tot 1 uur. Dat maakt voor mij nogal wat uit. Het is waar dat een auto duurder is, maar het extra comfort, betrouwbaarheid en tijdsbesparing maken dat ruimschoots goed. Qua kosten hangt het ook heel erg van wat voor afstanden je moet afleggen. De trein is op korte afstanden relatief erg duur.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks voor de uitleg, had ik geen idee van /s. Natuurlijk komen die kosten hoger uit maar jij trok ook gewoon 16euro enkele rit uit zonder rekening te houden met dat je dan nog abonnementskosten moet betalen, dus dan doe ik ook eenmalige kosten voor die rit. En tuurlijk gebruik ik m'n auto niet alleen voor zo'n enkele rit die ik 2 a 3x per jaar maak, het was zoals ik al eerder aangaf gewoon een voorbeeld om aan te tonen dat OV lang niet altijd effici #235;nt is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hoezo denk je dat? Ik heb gewoon een excelletje met benzine kosten, wegenwacht, verzekering, parkeervergunning, wegenbelasting, onderhoud en afschrijving. Dan kom ik uit met mijn kms per jaar en het benodigde onderhoud op 0.20euro per km. Vergelijk dat met wat je kwijt bent bij greenwheels 0.29euro per km excl uurkosten a 4 euro per uur, en abonnementskosten, of mywheels 0.27euro per km excl uurkosten a 2.50 per uur. En het is ook logisch. Die verhuurbedrijven hebben alle normale kosten plus personeel en andere overhead en willen ook nog winst maken.</TEXT>

Even if you go by car this will take you easily 2 hours or more, you have to travel through Utrecht which is crazy busy during peak hours and Amsterdam which is also crazy busy, and then your still not in Haarlem.

Answers to your questions: 1. yes, you need 55 euro(!!) a day, or you can have someone guarantee for you (for example your boyfriend). 2. yes, you need travelinsurance. Specifically one that covers at least 30k in medical expenses and one that covers expenses to return to the US due to medical issues, covers costs for urgent medical care and urgent hospital care.

    <TEXT>[Yes, you must have health insurance](https://www.government.nl/topics/health-insurance/compulsory-standard-health-insurance). What is the TU Delft Student Insurance? You will be able though to get allowence, which will mostly cover the cost, keep in mind that if you need something else other than GP care you will first pay a minimum of 385 out of pocket. I agree with carltanzler that it will be rough to get by with 235 especially when you also need to pay for your phone, clothing (?), any social activity, etc etc.</TEXT>

The best thing to do is at least visit your GP and ask for his recommendation, and maybe your PT can also advice you on this issue, he must have some experience with helping people from different hospitals.

    <TEXT>Although Amsterdam and Utrecht are more expensive in terms of rent, keep in mind that Groningen is not that much cheaper anymore. Every year that you study in the Netherlands your university will inquire if you have enough funds to continue. This meanst that (for 2020) you need just shy of 900 euro per month (https://ind.nl/en/Pages/required-amounts-income-requirement.aspx) or a total of 10.800 euro per calender year (you need to have this amount+the tuition fee in your bankaccount). You also need to pay the tuition fee (which depends on the program). You can do some work on the side (max of 16 hours a week) but you need to show you have sufficient funds besides this income. So if you want to do a bachelor's you need at least 32400 euro (but it would be better to get more since the amounts will likely increase (at least not become less). https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Sufficient-means-of-support-as-a-student.aspx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, yeah no problem. In the last years there have been more issues with groups of people causing a nuisance. As far as I know they mostly concentrate around the pond with the fountains in the middle of the park. This year the mayor already noted a couple of weeks ago that he would start enforcing the local law which prohibits the consumption of alcohol in public places (which excludes terraces who have to have approval from the municipality). Now it seems that the municipality has had enough and is saying they are starting to enforce the law (which was not enforced for a very long time because the municipality always argued that Noorderplantsoen was the backgarden for everyone in town). Now many people are upset because they feel like they are the victim of the bad behaviour of a few (which is true). My opinion is that this wont have as much of an effect as feared. I think that if you drink your beer or wine and dont cause any trouble you wont get a fine. But the police and handhavers have extra tools to combat groups that cause unrest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Het probleem is denk ik dat het heel lastig wordt om specifiek die groep aan te pakken zonder dat het heel selectief wordt ben ik bang. Daarom denk ik dat het ook wel zal meevallen voor de gemiddelde parkbezoeker. Zolang je geen overlast veroorzaakt zul je echt niet zo snel een boete krijgen. Dit levert echter wel extra tools voor politie en handhavers om de overlastgevers aan te pakken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nee niet mee eens. Uiteindelijk gaat zulke wetgeving om het verminderen van overlast en het tegengaan van 'gevaarlijke' situaties. Dit betekent dat iemand die 's nachts op een lege snel weg 20km te hard rijdt bv minder snel een bekeuring zal krijgen dan wanneer diegene dit zou doen tijdens de spits. Hetzelfde geldt, mijns inziens, in dit geval. De wet die alcohol consumptie in het openbaar verbiedt gaat er met name om overlast tegen te gaan en niet zozeer om iedereen die met een open blikje bier ergens zit te kunnen bekeuren.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tsja dat is toch ongeveer hetzelfde als het gedoogbeleid rondom wiet. Bovendien vind ik jouw stelling omtrent het aanpakken van de overlastgevers nogal beperkt. Veel overlast is toch in grote mate het gevolg van (overmatig) alcoholgebruik. Wildplassen, wildpoepen, mensen lastigvallen, lawaaierig zijn, allemaal zaken die vaak voortkomen of verergerd worden door alcohol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dont know what job you had in university and whether or not you did any extra curricular activities/internships but how are you going to earn enough money besides your studies to not loan these days. A couple years ago you would get a small amount from the government but that is not the case anymore. So you would need to earn around 1100/1200 euro a month at least to live. This means you need to work 26 hours a week on minimum wage to get 1100 euro a month (which is still before taxes btw..). Maybe this can be done but that party will quickly over as soon as you do HBO where you have lots of internships or if you do uni and you want to do some time abroad or an internship as well. Or if you study medicine etc etc.</TEXT>

So in the rest of the park you can still enjoy some beers. Seems to me like a good concession in the ruling which still allows people to drink and enjoys themselves but also combats the nuisance.</TEXT>

Generally it was pretty nice, they had some large events with music stages, pub crawls, pool parties etc throughout the week. I think/assume ESN is a bit more 'normal' where you get a tour around the city, meet people and do some pub crawls as well. But the KEI week is much much larger. The question is what and how will happen due to corona. Large gatherings and festivals are prohibited until september 1st.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not too familiar with this specific watch, but if you can download the sportstracker app why not just download the Suunto app instead? If that doesnt work you seem out of luck. Only solution is either building your own app, if that even works, or shilling out some money for a new watch. If the quest suits your needs you could go for a Suunto Spartan Trainer which is not that expensive, especially if you are happy with a second hand. I dont see how you need a data plan in any of these situations? Also, where are you from that you pay 100 dollars a month for mobile data?</TEXT>

Do keep in mind that you dont need a data connection for a newer watch. It connects with your phone via bluetooth to sync the data, thats all.

    <TEXT>All these things are so anecdotal.. I think it also is largely due to miscommunication between non Dutch and the Dutch healthcare. They might be acustomed to getting/doing things a certain way and expect them to be the same here which might lead to these kinds of results. I have never heard people complain about these types of behaviours from their docters. Also your comment on the life expectancy is also pretty short sighted..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dont think this plan will work, to be honest. The only reasonable way to work here for a US citizen is through the highly skilled migrant scheme or to freelance/start your own company throught DAFT. A job in a cafe wont be possible without a student visa (which requires you to study of course) and also very much limits the hours you can work. This also means that it is much harder to get an apartment because you have very limited income. Although, if you really have that much money saved up you might be able to work something out with a landlord. Your main concern is getting a visa which is going to be the hardest part.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If primary care is so horrible it should show in the statistics, which it doesnt, so it probably works just fine :) Also your statement about child birth is just false, you will see a verloskundige, which is definitly not a nurse..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is not a doctor but it is also not a nurse, since both have different educational programs, of which that of a midwife is specific to child birth, so to say it is just a nurse specialising is not really correct. It is a seperate bachelor compared to nursing. Seeing a doctor when you have no complications adds literally nothing except it shows that you look down on midwifes and their education. We spend a little above the EU average but our life expectancy is also quite high, with only Italy, Spain and some islands in the mediterranean being higher. You cant say that we have a general healthy population due to unrelated reasons, the same can be said for Spain, Italy or Germany.. Also, I just researched some comperative studies and could not find any study which regarded primary care as horrible or any thing like that. Most studies regarded the primary care in the Netherlands as very good..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only thing is that if you look up any research on this subject that there is no difference. Fat oxidation might be higher during your workout if your fasted but fat oxidation after your workout is longer if you just eat. At the end it doesn't matter and training fasted just comes down to preference. It has no benefits over training with food consumed when it comes to fat reduction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's going to be quite hard but not impossible as far as I know. The study of medicine is quite regulated, so the influx of students depends on the outflow of people quitting the profession. In the Netherlands you'll do 3 years of bachelor's, then 3 years for a masters degree after which you'll be a basis arts (regular doctor without a specialization). You'll do that for some years (1-3) and then you'll apply for a specialization which can take some years again (some may take up to 8 years). To be active in the medical field in the Netherlands you'll need to have a BIG registry which means you need to be fluent in Dutch. So if you want to do a masters in medicine you need to be fluent in Dutch already. Honestly I think it's easier to just become a doctor in the US. Good luck!</TEXT>

Battery wise if you are going to do day long hikes for a week almost any watch is going to need charging, because GPS will eat much of the battery. Just bring a powerbank along and charge it while you sleep or something. If you really want a Suunto look at the Suunto 9. If you really want a map you will need to look at Garmin and buy a much more expensive watch (Fenix series).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I lived in Amsterdam for 18 years and never had my bike stolen.. Might have been luck, who knows. I would say the cost of maintanance depends very much on how much you are willing to do yourself. If you buy a simple bike without gears and you are willing and able to fix or replace a tire you would spend on average maybe 40 euro a year tops. I have my bike with drum brake and hub gear for 10 years or something and maybe spend 200 euro in repairs all together. Most things im willing to do myself.</TEXT>

And yeah you are right many people still work full time, but for example many women work part time. Men now get 5 weeks of paid paternity leave, if I remember correctly. Biking: well, there were 203 people killed who were cycling, which has to do (I believe) with the increase of older people riding on ebikes. Still not a whole lot since the Dutch cycle 15 billion kms a year. And efficieny: dont know why you mention liquids on an airplane but this is thanks to the US who forced this 'counter terrorism' legislation upon the rest of the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm I see what you are getting at, Dutch doctors might be more oriented at keeping the costs down, but it is also more in Dutch culture to not go to the doctor quickly. I think women work part time because they like it.. Not sure what the exact reason is because in other European countries the rates of women working part time are much lower. So you might think it has something to do with culture.</TEXT>

While if you look at the grand scheme of the game there is no way to compete.. People pour like couple k's a month in it and still are not top dog. I spend a couple of dollars on it and still enjoy it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like others have said, its pretty much a caricature and more typical of the US, in my opinion, than of the Netherlands. I was looking at the website of the windmill in Pella which stated that "Almost every small town in the Netherlands has a mill at its center; this is our nod to Pella's agricultural past." Which shows that none of their inhabitants seem to have ever been in the Netherlands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey people, I have had an account with appen for ages but never got an assignment. Couple of days ago I got invited to a Malta project, all good and dandy, I do all the tests and requirements and got accepted. The last email they sent was that they still needed to work towards finalizing my Appen Independent Agent Agreement and that they had sent a seperate email with the required details. But I never got this email also not in spam (8hrs later). Am I being impatient or is something wrong? Thanks!</TEXT>

You can easily see this during and after the activity. Do keep in mind that the watch has limited space to save activities so after a while old activities will be deleted/overwritten. For updates: are you sure there is no way you can run Suuntolink on Linux? Maybe ask their customer service? Otherwise there is no other way that I know of. Maybe ask a friend to do it on their computer once in a while?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get your idea but I dont think they are trying the hide how bad its going since the news covers the numbers everyday whith stating that almost every day is a new record and that numbers are on the rise.
