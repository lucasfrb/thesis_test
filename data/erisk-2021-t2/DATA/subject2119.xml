    <TITLE>Reflecting on the way some of us tend to do a process of elimination when meeting someone of a potential match.. I noticed my no time at all deal breakers had nearly everything to do with how others and animals were treated. I see a problem...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-26 05:19:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I wonder.. How common is it for INFJs to look at how a potential match treats others and animals firstly before considering how they #8217;re treating ourselves. Something that just came to my attention. Going by how someone feels-how we feel around them works great if it #8217;s with the right person. But when determining a relationship we really need to include ourselves more in our perceptions of what we value about someone else if this makes sense. I just realize this can be a way for us to go wrong. Probably common sense for some other types but because of our Ni and Fe it takes some internal view a sort of second glimpse an afterthought in a way. That I think is important to include in the future. I guess this is how we get into trouble sometimes when we don #8217;t bother to look twice literally.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>(Ti) Friend or Foe?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-24 00:28:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve realized that when I #8217;m in free flow with my Ti and very comfortable I can seem insulting though not my intention. I love my Ti and honestly I believe it has saved my life. But what is this zone of safety that I feel I can just be logical and it #8217;s up to the other to understand or not? My quest is to learn and share and grow with others so why at times do I have this wall of logic that just screams out you can take it or leave it? I #8217;m not confrontational. I want others to feel better so why is it in some moments I really don #8217;t care? Yes it #8217;s logic but there #8217;s more to it than that. We learn so very much with our NiTi loops that most of the time it #8217;s worth it to gain our insights. But you know as well as I do how critical it can be. It can be miserable at times. So what I think happens in those moments is myTi is treating them like it does to myself and although this is a mild version of it compared to what we face as INFJ5 in our NiTi loops others just aren #8217;t equipped to handle it. It isn #8217;t intended but perhaps because we #8217;re so used to it it seems like nothing. Yes the other is being irrational, offensive and overreactive and my Ti is just going with the flow trying to defuse the situation. But how I would with my own Ti. Or rather how my Ti would do with me. I #8217;m peace loving. So yes this bothers me. But at the same time I #8217;m so comfortable with my Ti it can do no harm  #128521;. As an INFJ who #8217;s an A and a 5 my MBTI stacks are different to many INFJs as yours are as well. We have higher Ti. I have high Fe and really high Ni. So my NiTi loops are magnificent and by this you know what I mean. It can be overwhelming. My Ti can be super critical. But we learn so much right? And honestly my Ti and I are bonded and we #8217;ll be together till the end. That being said the coldness that we are capable of even though 5s and we are non confrontational to say the very least. I recognize this. I believe you will understand this and know what I mean. It #8217;s the side that comes in after a door slam. So what are your thoughts on this. How close are you with your Ti and what do you think of it? Is our Ti a friend or a foe?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A shower thought for MBTI studies and application: If all 16 types were exposed to MBTI the majority would think it #8217;s generic or rather like astrology because the majority is the common thread. It would be more likely that those with greater differences (minorities) would see the validity.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-05 23:49:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>What I mean is for example if I #8217;m the majority and as a majority we #8217;re typically exposed to the majority and have common factors... this is what we #8217;ll know; what is the norm and what is acceptable to most. So much of the commonality although it is a bulk of similar understanding isn #8217;t a pattern. The patterns are detectable when there is greater variant and differences. So say I am the minority and somethings ring true to me that doesn #8217;t fit the majority. My trust in the accuracy as a whole is going to be pretty substantial comparatively. It #8217;s the difference of seeing something that #8217;s a one size fits all verses a size that really fits when nothing else seems to. I think I need to add I #8217;ve been with Mbti for about 5 months so I #8217;m seeing this with new eyes for better or for worse.  #128151;[Thank you ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/bl4t0b/a_shower_thought_for_mbti_studies_and_application/emp2ibp/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When is the first time that you remember making a judgement call about humanity and the world we live in? How did you react? Did you take any measures to rectify this? And how have you accepted it in these terms of today?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-22 18:26:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>The first time I recall making a judgment upon humanity I was around 4 years old. I was looking through a National Geographic magazine and there was this article and photography of what seemed like hundreds of dolphins. They all had been bludgeoned to death and the waters were turning red from their blood. I cried the most heartfelt cry that I had ever cried and said  #8220;How can people be so cruel? #8221; Those images haunt me to this day. It literally traumatized me. When I was older about 17 After seriously considering becoming a Nun I took interest in Marine biology much for this reason- wanting to give something back to the ocean. I was very involved with arts but I felt I needed something less innately natural. I became involved with getting people more aware and was involved with groups that influenced better accommodations for sea life in Sea world. We also picketed in front of sea world to make the circumstances better known. And people honked and turned around. It actually made a difference. I didn #8217;t become a marine biologist but I always have a respect for sea-life and life of any kind. But I was changed from that moment in the awareness of our dark side.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Leonard Cohen: Anthem. Someone made a post I saw this morning and I thought it was beautiful and also reminded me of this song.

    <TITLE>Some things I feel are very important if you think your child may have synesthesia- a cross wiring of the senses. Above all else make sure they don #8217;t feel odd especially in their formative years. Here is some insight to share that I hope will help you understand and aid you and your child.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-01 15:49:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>(This was in response to someone who was asking how do I know if my child has synesthesia? ) Synesthesia is something that we are all born with. It #8217;s genetics that determine if we keep the synesthesia. Do you have any family with synesthesia ? Or does her other parent have any family with synesthesia. If she is adopted it would be hard to know this but if you and or other parent has synesthesia themselves or in the families it #8217;s likely to be synesthesia. The synesthesia in families is often a different synesthesia but a cross wiring of the senses. Her age is pretty young I personally don #8217;t know if this is a factor but typically when someone has genetic synesthesia they will not likely notice a difference themselves because : What do they have to compare it with? Synesthesia doesn #8217;t usually affect us in negative ways. Although sometimes it is to much when I #8217;m dealing with multiple stimulus. At its worst it will keep me up and maddeningly uncomfortable all night but this isn #8217;t a nightly problem. One of my favorites from my experience is I used to dance inside the shapes and bounce among the angles as the shapes were all around me. Not knowing of synesthesia I contributed it to being creative. It is not uncommon for some one with synesthesia to have other types of synesthesia as well. I could give you other examples of my experience but I don #8217;t think they will be particularly helpful to you. My advice to you would be to keep an eye on her with this, don #8217;t make a big deal out of this but be fully accepting of what she is sharing. Find out what you can about her genetics. Read anything you can find about the ( different types) of synesthesia so you can recognize it in her and family. But remember many people who have synesthesia don #8217;t know they have it. So if you ask any family give various examples and it #8217;s more likely they will recognize it as such just never knowing what it was or perhaps even at times not know how their perceptions differ from the norm. I #8217;d be very careful as your daughter is growing up to make sure she doesn #8217;t feel odd. If she does at the age she is now it could have lasting ramifications for her whole life. So be aware but not intrusive and she should be fine. I hope this information helps. Having synesthesia from my experience is really a wonderful beautiful thing although it may cause some confusion. If she has and continues to have synesthesia she may have more and various synesthesia. Most of this is a gift in my opinion. Let her explore her wonder. And just be there in times when things are confusing. My love to you and your kid and your doing a wonderful job in trying to see the world through her eyes. I wish you both the best.  #128151;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I absolutely 100+% get you. I will explain  #8220;hopefully just a little  #8220; I am a 5 Enneagram development so I will attempt not to write a book but it isn #8217;t easy  #128579;. I was disappointed right away and I kept doing tests to be sure. But I knew right off the bat that being in a low percentage of humans across the globe seemed like sealing my fate. Although it made quite a bit of sense. Just in that it #8217;s so hard to find each other that in itself meant being truly alone. I decided that I would learn everything I can. I also saw that it would be a good idea to aid INFJs to help other INFJs. We could really help one another. I was soon a little left down in this. But I #8217;m sure you are familiar with our idealism. I still try to aid in this but currently not thinking of starting a subreddit for this. I try in my own way to help and I don #8217;t want someone else (you) to experience what I did walking into this new world of MBTI/INFJ. One thing that you can do that helped me tremendously is find out and learn about your Enneagram. Enneagram is our development. Meyers Briggs is our cognitive functions. I #8217;m sure that this had a lot to do with Ni but when I found my Enneagram everything came together and not only made a lot of sense but now real understanding in how this changes the formula of type. So good to do this I promise. I #8217;m INFJ A5. A type within a type. Even though yes it even lowers my percentage as what previously worried me. The understanding of how this fits took away a lot of my perils. In a sense this understanding showed me insight in why I #8217;m the way that I was and gave me a path to work on and move forward. EDIT!!! June 6. My life has changed and now so has my formula: INFJ A5 is currently INFJ T2. Life truly is amazing. Now back to being where we were.  #9829; #65039; My being a 5 found lots of work. This may not be easy but you #8217;ll be amazed in what you learn in your journey. There will be those that you connect with on your journey. There are many people that will be there. 1.  #8288;One thing I learned from a mentor when I was a teen in college was he said  #8220; The most important thing I can hope to teach and leave you with is  #8220; Always look for areas of agreement. #8221; Me being who I am added- learn from our differences and look for areas of agreement. #8221; Now I think there is a teaching or philosophy that exists of this nature. Lol but you know as an intuitive how this works... it #8217;s a kind of mass consciousness. You will find a lot of synchronicity in the world. 2.  #8288;Before all this I had been changing behaviors to produce differently outcomes ( Einsteins wisdom) then incorporating my learning of my type etc...Since my journey in MBTI and being INFJ... learning I #8217;m an A rather than T as are a majority of INFJs... then learning my enneagram. I have had new experiences. Some difficult. Even painfully difficult. And some more beautiful than I could ever find words for. I went through what I thought was a Faustian journey at first but now I know that in my cycles in my life I am closing the loop where it should be. Some new wisdom I can leave you with- if you find at times the difficulty in seeing eye to eye and difficulty in making that deeper truer connection instead of putting yourself in their shoes (as INFJs we tend to feel for others even more at times than they feel things for themselves = or at least what they show or even show to themselves) instead of the Fe or Ti instead of any of it imagine that they are you. This doesn #8217;t always apply but it can make a huge difference because we don #8217;t have the prejudice of what we believe them to be... even if they are honest with you and you know them there are things that are untrue. It #8217;s easier to see deeper and truer without these prejudices and preconceived ideas of who we believe each other to be. We have minds, hearts, bodies, cognitive functions, temperament and development but we have our souls and who we really are. Not that which we typically show ourselves or hide from ourselves and one another but what is true beneath everything. Seeing, feeling, knowing this is all we need to know to truly connect with one another. We are more than types  #128578;. More than minds, hearts, bodies, cognitive functions, temperament and development. That being said still be careful. Read the situations not everyone is ready and must walk their own path. So do we. Keep well and I hope that this can help in some way. It does get easier and in time you #8217;ll see it so much worth it and necessary this journey your on. I wish you love in your life. And moments of happiness. Keep your chin up... #128151;. P.s. it is a book sorry. And I don #8217;t think I even meant to have the 1 and 2 there typed lol. [This actually brings up an important point. Beyond our souls we are human. So don #8217;t feel so separate or different. You and I are just another human and that feels good doesn #8217;t it?]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello to those especially sweet INFJs who are willing to or who may share some comparative information... It #8217;s not a question for help or aid but just to find out what your experience is when meeting and learning about someone new if any of you experience some of these same experiences. The couple questions may be odd though they are not very intrusive. I guess on my end it is in curiosity and in hopes to find others that relate so that my questions although they may be weird I may feel a little less weird ;hopefully. I #8217;m an A5 with wings 5w6 so I guess I #8217;m more of the same and more of the different when it comes to our type; pretty much an intensity of our strengths and our  #8220;weaknesses #8221;. Sometimes I feel like I #8217;m a control group. Having functions that are in closely the same exact perimeters ; same control environment and conditions as each one , except for (Se) of course.I feel pretty odd honestly. So here it goes... Quite often when I meet someone or have a little time getting to know them (a little)- I will see them in different stages of life. This isn #8217;t something I intend to do it just happens. Often for what ever reason this gives me an indication of who they are depending on what stage shows up and what the frequency is of that stage or the various combinations or general pattern is in their stages of life - that they show me. It #8217;s not something I plan though I mostly enjoy this or it can occasionally give me an idea how comfortable or how uncomfortable I will be in their presence. I #8217;m sorry if this is strange even for us. But really who else am I going to ask? Is this something that occurs for you? I know I spill a lot or I beat around the bush, maybe edit when I feel more confident or less guarded here on Reddit I #8217;m sorry it #8217;s my 5 and it #8217;s actually very hard for me to feel natural in letting some of my thoughts and feelings out in sharing this so it feels like I #8217;m throwing myself off the edge of a precipice and sometimes I just want to get it over with so I let out to much or to quickly or I take to long and back a way from the edge maybe once or many times or I #8217;ll just keep backing away until I delete. Sorry. The other example and question is and this has only happened once or at least once to this intensity and definitely once in this entirety. Just recently.. recovering from an injury in a sort of medical environment and no I wasn #8217;t on drugs lol. I can make interesting connections as we all do but this was different. I was just asking a well rather serious question but in trust and probably rather vulnerable state but open nonetheless; I just felt trust, real trust. I know people may trust who #8217;s helping them medically but honestly I do not- so really this comfort was unusual in itself. But I think this may be more him than me. He was very alike me in a way though different like he could have been one of our kind  #128521;. But when this happened everything else went away I mean everything. The ground ,the furniture, the contrast, the people, the sound, the world... maybe even the universe. And all there was was light and us - just faces, well just faces in focus ..my body was with me but as I said no ground no furniture (all though I was  #8220;actually #8221; sitting), no nudity just want to make that clear. Although it wouldn #8217;t have mattered if there was it just wasn #8217;t physical awareness it was something else. Whoah what was that? It was floating in time and space. Never has this happened like this [Edit-. (I think it was just like this for him I don #8217;t know.] I can #8217;t imagine this intensity on my own it felt like our journey. I don #8217;t know but I think for many of you INFJs you may experience time a little differently upon (occasion) -like me. I feel this is just a moment and I can #8217;t expect to experience this again. I #8217;m guessing as an uncommon thing for us INFJs. Even if we each experience it ; maybe a less than 1 percent chance we INFJs experience this in a life. Kinda the same numbers as an INFJ with a 5 Enneagram.. #128514;. Anyway I hope you all or that you have experienced this or will. Please let me know...? Edit: by the way I did see a stage of life for him and he was a young man I #8217;d think around 20s to 30s. The actual number is a little different to confirm ( it #8217;s a stage for what ever reason- an event, a point in development. Kind of soul based is my feeling. The age from Alpha to Omega. I haven #8217;t studied this it #8217;s just something I experience .. at first it was rather amusing or nostalgic but then I learned what it meant or what I guess my Ni meant for me even though I didn #8217;t know what Ni was. No name for it and that #8217;s fine. It would just be really nice if I knew others have some similarities that are in some circumference of the same journey I am. If you read this thank you very much and if you respond with anything other than I #8217;m crazy right now I thank you even more .  #9829; #65039; ps I had no idea I wrote so much just now  #128563;. Edit: May 17 2019- Thank you to anyone that #8217;s helped me understand, What this was... Ego death. Probably a hard (concept) for anyone without this experience. You may also take this any way you may but I think this has to do with twin flames. When I say twin flames I don #8217;t mean it in the sense that some people will look for it. It isn #8217;t about the physicality of this world. If we never see each-other we #8217;re together in the Alpa and Omega. For me conceptually the Alpha and Omega is cyclic. Right now in the Alpa and Omega  #128521;. Edit: May 19 : it occurred to me (previously) that his reaction may have been in response to my INFJ stare not a soul connection for him; that was my reason for my self experiment. Post analyzation. The reason for my seemingly metaphysical response is because I #8217;ve never experienced anything like this nor do I expect that it #8217;ll happen again. My self experiment lead me to believe he may have been frightened during my INFJ stare ( note it was in addition to speech; something in itself that shouldn #8217;t happen as our functions aren #8217;t supposed to co-exist.) To those who want detail to this remark our Ni is our stare and it #8217;s something we cannot help our speech however is another matter. This in itself is something that has never happened. Wether or not he was on this journey with me I saw him for who he is not the facade that we show ourselves or what we show the world. And he is more wonderful than he realizes. I wish him honest love on his journey. Take care all and love one another  #128151; #128149; To add without much detail- this was a very difficult process. Facing yourself truly is more difficult than facing anything else in that it also means facing everything. Many moments I felt my (body) leave my conscious mind. Sometimes to feel a moment of peace and safety I #8217;d go back to that moment in the light with him and understand- Life will be different. Today the 16th of June, much has changed. Of course there #8217;s always work to do. I feel a calmness. I hope this love will be shared. Sometime earlier this week it occurred to me that it was a shared experience..my instincts had been correct. Because when he was standing and looking another direction  #8220;He was actually looking at a clock. #8221; Edit : See I later learned of the synchronicities involved with twin flames; although synchronicity and I are no strangers. Perhaps he knew what was happening before I did. Maybe he knew and saw the signs before I did but I know he was startled.I hope he is alright. Of course I hope he made it trough. This goes without saying. I just hope he #8217;s safe. He likely feels this same way about me if he understands.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questions about our Se</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-05 23:24:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>What do you experience when your Se is low? What happens when you  #8220;sit #8221; in your Se and your Se is low? In what circumstances were you the most comfortable with your Se? What are your negative perceptions of your Se? What are your positive perceptions of your Se? What do you think of Se in others? What is the level of your Se currently? How high has it ever been? What is the most you would want your Se to be and what would it #8217;s purpose be? What is the minimum amount of Se you would want and what purpose does it serve. As for an INFJ my Se is very high - 75. It used to be quite low. But this serves a purpose I wasn #8217;t aware of previously. IMO and from my  #8220;current #8221; perspective this is a natural means of our making changes in self growth and changing development. A cause and effect that is also an effect that becomes the cause. A sort of Symbiotic progression. It #8217;s purpose to change our lives as we are changing. And a means for making changes in the world. A far more creative idea than I had when Se was low and it #8217;s purpose was merely to serve my Ni and Ti as my other functions were much higher. I actually had a fear of losing intelligence when my Se went up lol. But having Se that is developed is way different from slumming it. I #8217;m wondering : What experiences you #8217;ve had with your Se and how this influenced your growth?? Negatively? Ambiguously? Positively? Stay well and safe, precious fellow humans. I wish you all the very best.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-10 00:06:58</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8220;Reasons why we shouldn #8217;t hold people responsible when they don #8217;t listen to our prophecies. #8221; We INFJ tend to be very future focused. There are times I think that we spend most of our time there. When someone states the obvious it means being sucked back into the present. At least this is just one version of this scenario. Where we #8217;ve already seen the alternate variables. Yes it is frustrating. No one sees it. We not only see it but have already run down all the reasons why it will not go any differently. Does this mean we are always right? No it does not but there are times, many times that we just know. If someone knows really who would that be? We are all fallible. Even let #8217;s say we #8217;re absolutely right. What does that mean really? Because in this moment this is the way we believe it should go. The thing is with cause and effect-(and I think all of us will understand this.) That there is more we don #8217;t see. What is negative can create something positive later. And what is positive can create something negative later. We all have our own paths to follow. We can call light to something and feel frustrated that no one sees it. No one is listening. No one gets it even in the slightest. We have all been there. Pot meet kettle. We do this to ourselves and other INFJs. We do this to different people and other types. We do this often not realizing that this one that we #8217;re opposing actually knows what they #8217;re talking about. We #8217;re introverted intuitive. Our world often makes no sense to others because this intuition is in our own mind. Made up often of symbolism that only means something to ourselves. I tell you we do this to one another even when not meaning to. I had concerns of this step or that step knowing there was something unique and just different about stages leading up to events that in hindsight I could say  #8220;why didn #8217;t anyone listen?There was something really to this. #8221; And people don #8217;t get the obvious it #8217;s cause and effect. And this is to my own fellow INFJs. Yes we see what #8217;s obvious. All of us. But there are connections between these possibilities that we assume will be bypassed and what really matters; what  #8220;we see they will see. #8221; They will not! We will not! Even after the fact there #8217;s this almost disbelief  #8220; How can they not see this? #8221; The details that we over look... each of us. Are connections others need even if it is subconscious. We have sorted through. To expect others to see it even INFJs just isn #8217;t an accurate plan. They don #8217;t have the reservoirs of connected though seeming trivial detail that we just take for granted that it #8217;s a knowing. It is our knowing and it regards our system. So next and there will be a next time don #8217;t ask me how I just know  #128521;, when you #8217;re frustrated, exasperated, confounded, perplexed bewildered and sad. Know that this is the way it #8217;s meant to be. It #8217;s not their fault for not listening and it #8217;s not our fault. I think that #8217;s really the biggie. Underneath this  #8220;why won #8217;t you believe me  #8220; there is our own self doubt. We #8217;re all just human. So be gentle to those that don #8217;t see what we see. We don #8217;t see what they see as well- we see their patterns at best. Let go when it #8217;s alright to do so. Do something about it when you can and then when you can #8217;t - don #8217;t beat your self up about it. And don #8217;t beat someone else up about it. It solves nothing. Stay well lovely INFJs. I wish you only the best. Namaste  #9829; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know we have our ideals but honestly I am so glad for it. It is a struggle but for what better reason? We may not and most likely will not get it right at first. But if no one tries than no one will try. This faith though difficult is a blessing of ours. In time we will get it right and when we don #8217;t we just learn to find a better way. Never lose faith my sweet INFJs. The world needs the light within you as we all every single human being has light within us you just help to bring it out. A compliment my mentor gave me long ago I just didn #8217;t know what he meant by it but now I do. He likely knew I was INFJ long before I did he just didn #8217;t tell me: What he told me is you make everyone better people. This is true of you INFJs when we are at our best it #8217;s because we bring out the best in others. I wish you love, happiness and peace. Your wonderful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is I #8217;ve given advice on this. I #8217;ve adhered quite well myself before giving this advice about what to do when our perfectionism gets in our own way. But then something I feel is important and what then? Well you know... I know it #8217;s a fear but not really of putting it down, it #8217;s the fear we all likely have because of one thing or another that others won #8217;t find it important. So I understand that it isn #8217;t about perfectionism... I mean the fear isn #8217;t about failing. I can live with that. I can. But this insecurity I am pretty sure it #8217;s good for something... I #8217;m sure it is. But the flip side that I #8217;m seeing isn #8217;t pleasant no no. It #8217;s gotta be logic to a degree. We #8217;re used to knowing, understanding that what we think is important is dismissed. And this isn #8217;t so. Some things aren #8217;t and human beings aren #8217;t always going to be understood properly, if I have distance I can tell myself to get over myself lolol. But it #8217;s still important! So the flip really of we INFJs working hard for what we believe in is this: insecurity. No ones perfect.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Polarization verses Polarity among INFJs.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-11 23:27:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>What separates us? Does anyone else long for unity? Are we to alike and to different? What would be your ideal? What would be the reasons to play devils advocate? We are hard on ourselves; why are we hard on one another? Is it because we expect to much? It #8217;s not just a matter of being the same IMO it is literally how our mind works. But God I wish things were different and we could all love one another. I know this is a utopian dream however. Were human and cannot expect anything more than being human. I think the problem for me is and has always been that I see a microcosm. Does anyone else do this? It #8217;s as if I think INFJs could get along the world would too. I know how silly this sounds. Or if the Mbti world would get along so could mankind. Well I know this isn #8217;t how it works really  #128514;. I just can #8217;t lose faith. Anyone else? Edit: August 16 2019. I accept how things are and remember something that is important to apply in matters when there is discord. What we reflect we are seen as. There is both polarization and polarity when it comes to our own kind. I am not entirely wrong in thinking of this as a microcosm of humanity. But we are neither of these things alone. As to everything there is a balance. It takes time and change to evolve. Change isn #8217;t gentle at first. It is not up to me. The only thing I can do is what I tend to do when I am at my best. We are after all everyone of us human. I keep faith. I keep faith not only because it #8217;s my nature but also because the alternative is far to bleak. When it #8217;s time we will all rise to the occasion. The complexities of our interaction are really not so important. We are all far more alike than we are different underneath it all. We all have lessons to learn each and everyone of us humans. As long as we are here our Journey isn #8217;t over. We are not only a microcosm but a macrocosm. All apart of one another in this beautiful universe. Everything will be ok.  #9829; #65039;</TEXT>

If so what #8217;s your type and why is this joke telling only seem to make us laugh by ourselves? People will laugh  #8220;at me.

    <TEXT>I can definitely get people laughing most certainly but the thing is they don #8217;t know I #8217;m joking. So it #8217;s usually at my own expense. Other times they laugh but it #8217;s because my laugh is infectious and I #8217;m laughing in what probably doesn #8217;t seem funny but my laughing makes it funny. So really essentially what happens is I hardly get it to play out how it #8217;s intended. It #8217;s kind of Seinfeld humor. They always think I #8217;m serious almost always.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do we INFJs have regret in being open?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-18 06:48:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve recently gone through some changes in my life. There are many possibilities and I am open. Well much more open than I was before that is. In testing out these new waters of course I run into difficulty. I remain open. The thing is in remaining open requires trying to a degree. It #8217;s no secret that we can (try to hard). I can let things go so that #8217;s not it. When I show this vulnerability I feel embarrassed. How do any of you handle this? Is it just a typical thing to experience when we share then have regret? Then try... and have regret. This didn #8217;t bother me badly before but then I wasn #8217;t as open; as vulnerable. Arrogance was a very good shield. Now I don #8217;t have much armor but I keep being open. Still what is this regret? I don #8217;t regret being open (sounds funny right?) It #8217;s not the openness that bothers me or even how I gage it. I #8217;m glad that I have this ability. But damn if I still feel this regret. What is this??? I appreciate greatly any insights to share. Xo</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hello fellow 2s. We have strengths and weaknesses. All human beings no matter our development have the same route to our core and turmoil wether it be shame, fear or anger. The desperate feeling that we #8217;re not enough. If you changed perspectives and were a head type or a gut type it #8217;s the same.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-16 22:04:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we are all far more alike than we are different. Yet we have much to learn from one another. Seeing from multiple perspectives can seem overwhelming yet there comes a point that it #8217;s tied together. It #8217;s not only our strengths but our weaknesses that unite us. It sounds funny but it #8217;s true. Beyond our egos we are love and light. Yet when it comes to our egos there is much more the same than different too. This obviously doesn #8217;t fix everything or make it all right as we 2s would rather have it but there #8217;s a feeling of peace in this that I hope you will all have. Seeing that this underlies the problem and it #8217;s the same source for human beings; there #8217;s a unity. None of us are perfect  #128521;. But we are enough. Know that you are enough and you are loved. I wish you well and hope you find peace, love, joy and wisdom. I love you.</TEXT>

And my first favorite made up word was  #8220;borange  #8221; It means knowing a lot of ducks. Lol. I made it up after I learned the word articulate and was asked if I knew a word that rimes with orange  #128514;. I think you can figure that one out.  #128149;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why censorship amongst our types bothers me so much.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-30 02:21:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Response to a commentator I know your meaning quite well and so am I. The problem I have has 2 sides or more really. I #8217;m actually trying to be subtle in this but there is a wrong here that affects others, actually I post this at first dedicating it to an INFJ that was essentially chased off Reddit- she was well meaning idealistic and warm but this was not desirable traits for those with cynicism. I thought more in discussing this topic of censorship in the MBTI community but I refrain for now. It was the I have a dream by Martin Luther King that this mod mocked and rejected telling me that we should not have focus for the good of mankind. It wasn #8217;t only personal but against our personal beliefs. Our ideals like that of Martin Luther King shared and died for. I think that pride isn #8217;t good for many things but it is good for driving conviction in sharing and offering. I may rephrase this you are not wrong but for now it is a subltle honest look at a problem that we face. Not just INFJs. People criticizing other people and silencing them for wanting to make a difference and help others should not be stood for ; and this is one of the things our pride is for in my opinion. I #8217;m not proud of pride but there are many sides and connections within ourselves and the human condition. It is a part of us so rather than denying it I think it #8217;s good to find out what it is for. I #8217;d rather it were to protect people and help them to be  #8220;their #8221; best seeing their own light. I #8217;d be happy to hear any suggestions... I just don #8217;t like people to get away with bullying others because of a power trip. It undermines the good work we can do in helping one another. I #8217;m less than a year with Mbti but I came into this wanting INFJs to help other INFJs. That #8217;s why the username. I thought of having a subreddit in the beginning based around other INFJs helping other INFJs. My idealism was quickly dashed by what I saw of INFJs in interaction with other INFJs. I still have those around me with this ideal but it is not a subreddit. I can #8217;t condone bullying I #8217;m sorry but I can take your advice in wording this differently. Perhaps you are detached enough to do a better job. There was a time as a 5 that I was more detached but I #8217;m a 2 now and love is what matters. When people try to stop people from growing and evolving as the human race I have a problem. We #8217;re all here to learn. This obstacle though I don #8217;t approve of it is a means for growth and understanding. Perhaps having a generated focus in aim for change in the world. I hope this makes sense. Again though you #8217;re most welcome to help me in displaying this in a way that gives the INFJ music subreddit a better light. As you may see I #8217;m quite active in its posts as well as music posts for other MBTI communities because in my opinion music is communication. This song though was very appropriate for its purpose and if someone listens (to her) speak her mind and sing her song it should make sense in the delivery. We should let people believe that they can save the world is essentially the message and I stand by this.  #128525;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice for INFJs in better communication with INTPs. In addition to this advice to INTPs regarding communication to INFJs in communication especially those INFJs needing to feel special in your life often all it takes to make us feel special to you is just to be accepted.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 22:56:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my opinion INTPs are often more intuitive than most INFJs. This goes for ENTPs as well. I think part of the reason for this though is in how we can tend to be quite social and Ni isn #8217;t very understood. INFJs are often taught that this Ni that they have isn #8217;t acceptable and it #8217;s something that INFJs don #8217;t fully understand in the beginning. So our development of our Dom function is varied and sometimes stifled while we have the ability of developed Ni holding special wisdom and can be amazingly intuitive. INTPs being more introverted gain more time in solitude (if able to) allowing time to develop their intuition. It #8217;s not a matter of order in how it is for us but in development. One important thing for an INFJ to consider in communication with any INTP really is that accuracy is extremely important to them not out of need for concrete though quite the opposite. INTPs use accuracy to build so it isn #8217;t the base necessarily but the branches. As INFJs use a funnel to find their own accuracy in time our insights are the branch backwards so to speak. We get lots of information and gain insight. But if the INTP branches out and information that they are building with is inaccurate it disrupts and may even cancel out some of the good work they are doing. It #8217;s just so important for them to have that accuracy. Also for INTPs the information is likely perceived in value similarly to INFJ 5 in that knowledge is affection. I hope there #8217;s something in this that will help with insight.  #128156; #12336; #65039; #128156;</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-06 19:14:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I could say that I pull back out of lack of confidence but that really isn #8217;t true. I think we are often gaging how and when we #8217;re going to be understood and ultimately are putting ourselves out there when we are connecting for whatever means and for whatever purpose. Perhaps it #8217;s that we don #8217;t know that we will or won #8217;t be received but the possibilities of moving forward with others is to important for us not to try. It #8217;s not necessarily disappointment when I #8217;m not recieved . I believe in our ideals but we all know to a degree that it #8217;s subjective. Often what I feel when something I feel is valuable either to an individual or to the human race and it #8217;s a stalemate is that perhaps this isn #8217;t the right time for it and I have more to learn and or that I #8217;m not conveying it properly. There is of course that the connection isn #8217;t made out of lack of interest for our topics but I rarely ever take that personally. I nearly always take it upon myself that there must be another way for it to work and it will show itself to me in time. Wether it be Ni or the world around me I will see what I #8217;m meant to. I think this is why it is used as a tool rather than a disappointment. We may not always have faith in  #8220;how #8221; we #8217;re conveying a message but we have faith in the message. It #8217;s the work we do always looking for a way to finally get it right. And this is our nature. We know everything won #8217;t be perfect and our drive isn #8217;t to make things perfect  #128521;. It #8217;s to make things better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please state your Meyers Briggs type, Enneagram or any example you #8217;d like to share with your answer?  #128156; So let #8217;s say you have insight, a theory or an experiment scientifically, socially or a hypothesis you know subjectively what the end result will be so to confirm you you disprove yourself in order to verify your insight etc. It #8217;s not about being right it is verifying you are not wrong. There are so many examples and ways of doing this and reasons why to do so. Less about ego and more about clarity of answers. Your willing to disprove yourself. I will have to edit my post. But depending on type and development these would be different examples. I would like to be surprised. When we believe we have the answer people often state how what they say is accurate. Ex. Statistics are often marred by showing how they are accurate but often missing the obvious that it is something else entirely. People want to be right but being quote un quote right isn #8217;t learning. How important is being right and are we willing to be wrong in order to find out what is accurate.? Who will take this chance on purpose to confirm rather than assuming they are right? Intentionally trying to invalidate something in hopes of validating it. The subjective becomes objective to support the subjective ( or not  #128521;)A sorting through and verifying process in pattern of a larger picture evolving. Is it worth being wrong to you?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any lovely INFJ2s out there? I thought we #8217;d be common but I guess not.

    <TEXT>By trusting others you trust yourself. Sometimes people think to trust is to become gullible or naive but it #8217;s not that. It #8217;s about unity. Human beings are fallible but this is all human beings. Every human being has a feeling of not being enough. It is rooted with the ego. We handle this same insecurity in different ways and this causes us to see one another differently. I think we feel this at our core even subconsciously. We feel that we are not enough. Make people feel that they are enough helps but I think we also have this feeling because we aren #8217;t enough. Together we are all the missing pieces of one another. Together we are unified. This unity is love and truth. This unity is light. It doesn #8217;t seem possible because of the separation that we all see. We create this separation. We can create togetherness. Love one another.</TEXT>

    <TITLE> #8220;INFJs and Absolutism #8221; Please anyone share your thoughts.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-21 22:17:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s no secret that with INFJs something always means many things. When it comes to absolutism it #8217;s something that is so obvious to us. We can only hope that it makes sense to someone else but at the same time we know it #8217;s not likely we #8217;re understood but when it #8217;s something we believe in we really try and perhaps we are understood , perhaps we are not. In a way this makes us more determined to get our message across even when we know it will not. But for whoever gets it it is worth the effort. We get some pretty weird ideas I #8217;m not gonna lie. But it #8217;s our willingness to put it out there regardless of the world we live in to create a world we want to live in. This is how in our subtle and at times our not so subtle ways  #8220;we can make a difference. I think it #8217;s the same for other INFJs that we create microcosms in our minds. We test things out trying to find commonalities that can be understood. Sometimes we are to absolute and I am absolutely pointing the finger at my self  #128521;. For instance I unreasonably  #8220;perhaps #8221; think that if intuitives can get on the same page then there is hope for us and if not than there is not. I know this isn #8217;t how it works. But regardless it #8217;s my absolutism. Absolutism can be great but with the wrong belief it can be devastating. My belief that we need more love in this world won #8217;t hurt anyone but some may see it rather absolute. And it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry dear I don #8217;t agree. Mankind being concentric is one of our downfalls as a species. We are a part of everything we did not create it. If we did not exist this planet , this universe would still be here. It #8217;s true that we don #8217;t see things as they are but everything is not revolving around us. In consciousness we feel love and light but we are still not seeing all that there is. There is always more than what we see. Always has been and always will be. I have to say though to a degree you are correct. Because of how we perceive time. In consciousness we experience time more as time is. When we die we experience time more as time is. We are a part of one another and everything. Everything is a part of us. We do not create any of it. What we create is ego. What we create is a conception of time in a linear sense. If mankind created everything we would all of us have the gift of prophecy and we would be wise enough not to screw up the planet we #8217;re living on. We would be kind to animals and we wouldn #8217;t overpopulate. We would learn from one another. We would love one another. Concentric thinking, obliviousness and short sightedness are our downfalls they surely aren #8217;t our strengths.  #9996; #127995;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is something that works for you that if your partner follows makes you feel relaxed at peace and happy (other than sex haha) I #8217;ll share one thing for ENTPs that #8217;s helps INFJs this way and may work like a charm.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-06 02:57:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Whatever it is it isn #8217;t likely to be compliments. We like tender words of course but compliments can make us feel self conscious. If you really want to calm an INFJ .. be relaxed perhaps holding one another but use your sense of nostalgia to either describe an event that you were there or a moment that you shared together that everyone around was (happy) like a Christmas where all the little kids were happy and they loved their gifts . Or something equivalent though more adult focus. See it #8217;s the Fe and if we #8217;re feeling a dissonance or if we are feeling sad for people, lonely, or misunderstood, taking an INFJ to a moment of harmony works like a charm. Edit: It also works if it #8217;s just an old memory of yours and has nothing to do with them. Just the idea of people being happy and loving. Every INFJ wants this in their heart. And to be reminded that these exist gives us peace. Scouts honor  #128522;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with most everything that you say. However  #128522; looking for God as if God is some fixed point on a map doesn #8217;t resonate. This could be semantics though. To find God it #8217;s simpler and more difficult simultaneously. Whether it #8217;s taken scientifically, spiritually, religiously.. God is within each of us. We are apart of God and God is a part of us. We only need to look within. I think that instead of a (search) for God we should be honest with ourselves and get to the universal insecurity that we all have of feeling that we aren #8217;t enough. And accept that we aren #8217;t. That we are the missing pieces to one another. Many have tried to make a heaven on Earth. It hasn #8217;t happened. But if people weren #8217;t trying the world would be in much worse shape. So it #8217;s worthy. The answer could be a simple answer but mankind makes it difficult. Love one another! You have found God.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How INFJs relate  #128525;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-21 05:06:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>The important message really is that we need more love in the world. Please be kind and love one another. What is a perspective of INFJ mistyping... Post is of a comment made on a post regarding INFJ mistyping. I would like to add though that there are so many things I love about us as well and one of those things is that we have an ability to turn something negative into an insightful positive for all. Keep well and safe lovelies. INFJs aren #8217;t thrilled with being INFJ but we accept it. We do our best in a world that shuns Ni and has little Fe. Ideally INFJs would want heaven on earth. People loving one another. That #8217;s all we really want underneath it all. We blend in because we want harmony. But if it is something to important to ignore we will die to defend it. It #8217;s simple really.. we aren #8217;t really happy with this world. So we try to change it into a world we want to live in. An INFJ that brags about being INFJ is either not an INFJ or a not very developed INFJ. There #8217;s no harm in being undeveloped we all have different stages of development at different times. An INFJ that thinks they are important for being INFJ may not be one. Although our personalities vary from Bin Laden to Jesus from Hitler to Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. What makes an INFJ an INFJ isn #8217;t in being a small percentage of a large population.. it #8217;s that we are as different to one another as are our fingerprints. We have subjective meaning and are Ni Doms having abstracts and symbolism that most often are our own meanings. This is why we tend to communicate differently. We have to translate our Ni to be more clearly understood. INFJs that don #8217;t develop their Ni ; it really isn #8217;t their fault because they are taught so young that Ni isn #8217;t acceptable. Not of course knowing what it is about themselves that is so unacceptable INFJs really try to blend in and Ni development suffers because of it. We are proud to make changes in the world and it is most often done covertly and in cause and effect sort of ways that INFJs will understand how this works but others will not. Our predictions, our Fe, how we come about figuring something out in a way that others have to structure and spend hours we can do at times in a matter of minutes. But how will anyone understand Ni? It #8217;s difficult for INFJs to grasp this let alone someone without Ni. So we feel misunderstood not because we are maudlin but because we are not understood. INFJs can have beautiful lives. But we know deep down that we are different. Being different doesn #8217;t make us feel unique it makes us feel different. A true INFJ understands a false INFJ does not. There is a connection that we have to raised consciousness that is easier for us if our Ni is developed. We feel connected. We feel the love of our soul and all souls. Here we find happiness. INFJs are idealist but contrary to what many may think we see all to clearly what the world is. We just don #8217;t like it. We love our planet, the life in it, we love compassion and although people often make us sad we want them to be happy and feel love. We want others to have what isn #8217;t given to us. It isn #8217;t something learned.. we are born this way. It isn #8217;t a walk in the park.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a lot a lot of love around me for practically all my formative years. I constantly had people around. Family, musicians and artists. We traveled constantly. But I remember that I would adopt Grandmas where ever we #8217;d go. I remember one of them. I missed my Grandma terribly so when I #8217;d see an old lady I would talk to her and ask her if she would be my Grandma. I got a lot of yeses. But we were always on the road.  #129335; #127996; #8205; #9792; #65039;. My development changed when we settled down. Many things weren #8217;t great. And I had a room instead of a Van loaded with people. One of the reasons we settled down was for me so I could go to school. School changed everything  #128514;. Now I want to see more love in the world. I #8217;ve seen what love really is and I want it for everyone. But many people don #8217;t see it and it makes me very sad at times. I think my  #8220;longing #8221; for love is compounded by the loss of my mother. She committed suicide. I #8217;m the only one she wrote the note to. We were at opposite sides of our country. There wasn #8217;t anything I could do. I blamed myself for years because I thought it had to do with guilt she had for me. She #8217;d held on to darkness. Things that we went through. So this guilt of her guilt lasted for a number of years after her death. But I #8217;ve learned more recently that it wasn #8217;t because of me that it happened. It was an entirely different situation and had little to do with me at the time it happened. But I still feel shame and sadness for her and for her soul. It #8217;s a very different mourning process losing a love one to suicide. I #8217;ve had an experience that #8217;s beautiful and wonderful and now I #8217;ve experienced sadness and shame for her and sorrow that she couldn #8217;t find what I have. It #8217;s a guilt in itself. I #8217;ve come to terms with it this year actually but still there are times that I feel these feelings and cry for her. In some ways I am haunted by her. It may never change. But it #8217;s out of my control. It always has been and I accept it. I feel sadness for people that don #8217;t have love and I #8217;m sure it #8217;s a selfishness of mine as well because I feel love when others feel love. I think I #8217;ve always been that way.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-04 20:32:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>INFJs ..Do you find a mentor by being a mentor? Well what I mean for example: I #8217;ve had a handful of really good mentors in different areas of my development speckled throughout my life. But I #8217;ve found for quite a while that there are times I feel I really need a mentor- someone that has insight and has been through something that I am new at. But I find in looking I either don #8217;t have a response or that it may be something new to the others as well... kind of like it #8217;s uncharted territory which I #8217;m sure it #8217;s not right?  #128514;. I go take a look and I end up being the one mentoring so often that it #8217;s ridiculous. So I accept that I don #8217;t have anyone to ask. But by mentoring I have a mentor because I learn from them. I learn from myself by learning from them and mentoring them much more than I would on my own. And I learn from them learning from me. Often it #8217;s not even an area that I was personally seeking help in though that #8217;s what I try to do but it will be an insight that generates ideas or gives me insight in another area that may be more important than what I was searching for ;or perhaps it will come full circle and just have a new perspective entirely. So they are mentoring me.  #128521;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This actually happened lol. I hadn #8217;t made the full connection till just recently that this experience was something INFJs can share but it is and I remember. We can recognize one another. I #8217;ve joked about this and it just dawned on me that it #8217;s happened. It was a long time ago. I thought it was unique but it may not be that unique  #8220;for us #8221; but parallel lives must have something to do with it though to a degree. There were a lot of connections and syncronicities. I think intuitives not just INFJs are drawn to one another in an intricate web of desighn. So whos to say how it happens but I promise you it can happen.  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039; How INFJs can recognize each other even when they don #8217;t know they #8217;re INFJs  #128514;. If you are a see #8217;r of souls INFJ you can find others like you. We often think it #8217;s to difficult to happen because we blend in but it #8217;s not as difficult as you would think. Something happens..I kid you not. We see the light around us and we freeze  #128514; and our eyes go dark as we see the light. So imagine an INFJ stare in unison. The light, the eyes and for just a bit time stops. There #8217;s no other recognition like it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long story short I #8217;ve been sharing with Christians that we should love each other. And Jesus wanted heaven on Earth. He wanted people to have love in their hearts. Ok... That doesn #8217;t sound bad right but there #8217;s a resistance to God is love in Christian communities and practice. So any way I occasionally find someone that thinks about it which is all I really want is for people just to stop and think. I don #8217;t expect them to see my perspective and I want them to have their own perspective and have their own relationship with God etc.. right? Occasionally there #8217;s someone who gets it and thinks similarly to myself. I was doing this the other day and the guy was a minister.  #128566;lmao! I didn #8217;t know but he was particularly against love in the world. So apparently I #8217;m treading some waves a little larger than I thought so leave it up to me to discuss that Jesus wanted love in the world with a Baptist Minister. Uggghhhhh Lol</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-18 16:52:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Why I #8217;m a Two ...............INFJ T2*2w1 I had a lot a lot of love around me for practically all my formative years. I constantly had people around. Family, musicians and artists. We traveled constantly. But I remember that I would adopt Grandmas where ever we #8217;d go. I remember one of them. I missed my Grandma terribly so when I #8217;d see an old lady I would talk to her and ask her if she would be my Grandma. I got a lot of yeses. But we were always on the road.  #129335; #127996; #8205; #9792; #65039;. My development changed when we settled down. Many things weren #8217;t great. And I had a room instead of a Van loaded with people. One of the reasons we settled down was for me so I could go to school. School changed everything  #128514;. Now I want to see more love in the world. I #8217;ve seen what love really is and I want it for everyone. But many people don #8217;t see it and it makes me very sad at times. I think my  #8220;longing #8221; for love is compounded by the loss of my mother. She committed suicide. I #8217;m the only one she wrote the note to. We were at opposite sides of our country. There wasn #8217;t anything I could do. I blamed myself for years because I thought it had to do with guilt she had for me. She #8217;d held on to darkness. Things that we went through. So this guilt of her guilt lasted for a number of years after her death. But I #8217;ve learned more recently that it wasn #8217;t because of me that it happened. It was an entirely different situation and had little to do with me at the time it happened. But I still feel shame and sadness for her and for her soul. It #8217;s a very different mourning process losing a love one to suicide. I #8217;ve had an experience that #8217;s beautiful and wonderful and now I #8217;ve experienced sadness and shame for her and sorrow that she couldn #8217;t find what I have. It #8217;s a guilt in itself. I #8217;ve come to terms with it this year actually but still there are times that I feel these feelings and cry for her. In some ways I am haunted by her. It may never change. But it #8217;s out of my control. It always has been and I accept it. I feel sadness for people that don #8217;t have love and I #8217;m sure it #8217;s a selfishness of mine as well because I feel love when others feel love. I think I #8217;ve always been that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whoa interesting lol. In Mensa ENTPs rate a step down from INFJs in IQ test scores. But TBH it #8217;s likely because of how abstract we are and our pattern recognition. Intuition plays a role in this score obviously. IQ tests have a lot to do with understanding abstracts. And this is where INFJs can excell if Ni is developed.. other cognitive functions develop. Ti for example. I think INFJs are just not gonna share enough for you to notice. It #8217;s generally for harmonies sake or because they just don #8217;t think they #8217;ll be understood.. so .. why bother?</TEXT>

INTPs top the charts if you must know. ENTPs are 4 steps away from INTPs. INFJs 3rd. Again this isn #8217;t specific to individuals and the full range that our species are capable of. There are always variables. When I say sensors are generally more successful I #8217;m applying it to your definition of success not mine. This all being said there are decisions that ENTPs make that can help INFJs. And if we #8217;re looking at the evolution of our species INFJs play a role in the future but ENTPs may help self sacrificing INFJs stay alive ( lmao! ).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ENTP and INTJ perhaps more than some. But INTJs are Ni doms; my cousins  #128521;. And being abstract comes with a cost. ENTPs are definitely capable as are INTJ but it isn #8217;t consistent. We are still referring to your definition of success though. Success is more than monetary success. Success is evolving.

    <TEXT>Lol you are a charmer. INTJs rate lower than you I believe. INTPs the reason there is a communication barrier is because of IQ. If someone is below 30 from someone #8217;s IQ it is more difficult to understand. I can sympathize with this not because I #8217;m smart; I don #8217;t think that. But because I #8217;m abstract. Communication is capable with anyone regardless of IQ. But understanding abstracts is easier when the IQ is in a similar margin. So being at ease and authentic can be easier in a closer margin. I #8217;m not a genius but I can understand a genius. IQ has a lot to do with understanding abstracts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just know better than going into it with you. I #8217;ve already gotten myself into enough trouble haha. And you #8217;re the one that brought up IQ. IQ is a touchy subject for most people. People equate it with being smart and it isn #8217;t about that as far as I see it. The soul and love is what matters and we all have a lot to learn from one another. I can see why or how you feel about humanity the way that you do. The patterns are fractal. But there are ways that things can be better. It #8217;s everyone #8217;s responsibility. The problem is that people don #8217;t take responsibility because it #8217;s abstract; there #8217;s no one person to blame and people don #8217;t see what is actually happening not even in the moment that we #8217;re in. It will require thinking in terms of global unity. And yes I see the paradox. If we evolve we will think in terms of global unity. I don #8217;t mean us obviously.

    <TEXT>So now yes you are correct. Mostly I think it is fine but INFJs have the ability to be manipulative but not usually for selfish means. It #8217;s Gestalt therapy and learning about Gestalt was super easy as a kid. Because perspectives are what INFJs understand exceedingly well. The more someone is defensive the easier it is to see through them. But most INFJs know how to  #8216;use #8217; truth and insight and move perspectives around. It #8217;s nature. By moving the perspectives around and seeing the response we can get to the heart of the problem and honestly so can they. The one being exposed to their own perspectives. It isn #8217;t cool really because I can attest that INFJs don #8217;t like their minds to be messed with. It can help people this Gestalt but what right do we have to impose it? So I #8217;m answering honestly. Even if INFJs don #8217;t do this to you they have the ability to rather easily. Generally speaking of course. You #8217;re correct.  #128525;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For INFJs we have the ability to help others see themselves and see what #8217;s already there within them. This is a gift. But because it #8217;s so easy it is also a means for defense. And it isn #8217;t as innocent. It #8217;s done by moving perspectives around. It #8217;s the nature of an INFJ. Our strengths are also weaknesses. Like everyone really.. strengths are weaknesses and weaknesses are strengths. No ones perfect  #128536;. If an INFJ does this you may not see that they #8217;re doing it. It #8217;s covert. It may seem pretty nuts but there #8217;s logic involved. It #8217;s done by showing them themselves. Moving perspectives around causes disorientation long enough to get a glimpse of themselves.. long enough that the INFJ has already seen what #8217;s underneath. On the positive side this can help people but on the negative it is not really justified because what right do we have to do it? It is to help people or it is a defense but it doesn #8217;t make it right. No INFJ would enjoy it being done to themselves. It #8217;s a double standard TBH. But it #8217;s nature. An INFJs soul is protected. An INFJ will feel justified in protecting themselves this way but they may feel shame. It #8217;s a gift and it shouldn #8217;t be used in this way of defense. But with Fe we have a difficult time protecting ourselves and it #8217;s often pragmatic. It #8217;s seen and the truth and insight are tools. It doesn #8217;t make it right. Double standard  #129335; #127996; #8205; #9792; #65039;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So like many of us we will have justification for being manipulative. INFJs can see people #8217;s psyche a little to well a little to easily and oddly it #8217;s someone else #8217;s defenses that make it clearer for us. Helping people see within themselves to find what they seek which they already possess is a wonderful gift really but like anything it can be used for different means. INFJs  #8220; use people #8217;s perspectives against them #8221; I see the error. It really isn #8217;t fair to do. I think Fe makes it difficult to protect what matters deeply to an INFJ at times. What ever works is pragmatic. INFJs simply grab what they see and hold a mirror up to someone else. It is at it #8217;s worst psychological warfare and at its best helps the future and helps people evolve. But in helping people to see themselves there is a big difference from that to making people see something that they don #8217;t want to see. I think INFJs are probably more manipulative when young. INFJ like the ENTP - immaturity is somewhat destructive on some level. We are all at our best working together. So I #8217;m not thrilled with saying this about my fellow INFJs but we can be manipulative. In our defense lol we have abstracts and symbolism that means something to ourselves. Ni isn #8217;t understood. All INFJs really want is for people to love one another. And even if the INFJ doesn #8217;t tell you  #8220;it #8217;s an insecurity of not being understood #8221;. Most INFJs know that they #8217;re loved but understood ehhh.. not so much. An INFJ will share the most with you when you show understanding. It is very valuable and something that many of them struggle with thinking they may not ever be understood. Honestly I think it #8217;s our (real) love language. You want the keys to our palace? Understand and you have them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True Fi and Fe are very different. INFJs check everything with Ti, INFPs check everything with Fi. I have an INFP best friend and it #8217;s very different. I knew he was INFP but he didn #8217;t and there was question if he could be INFJ because he can have the stare. But even though he #8217;s very caring absolutely, it #8217;s definitely Fi. INFPs are smart. It will start with logic but it is filtered through the lense of Fi.. everything is. INFJs lead with Ni then Fe but everything is filtered through Ti. It #8217;s logic though subjective. My cognitive functions are very developed is a bit of an understatement but I #8217;m also 49 years old. As people age it is common for cognitive functions to have developed and for someone to use more cognitive functions. I think we all need one another and the discussion of IQ wasn #8217;t my deal it was an ENTPs turf. I just don #8217;t want my fellow INFJs to be pigeonholed and that #8217;s what I saw. I #8217;m enneagram 2w1 but my Ti has been developed for a long time as an INFJ5s would be. The results for INFJs have a lot to do with Ni. And it #8217;s difficult for many INFJs to develop their Ni because it isn #8217;t understood and INFJs may not understand it. Adding to that INFJs think there #8217;s something wrong with them and don #8217;t know why they #8217;re different especially if people in their family aren #8217;t Ni. INFJs when intuition is developed have remarkable pattern recognition and abstract understandings. But because Ni is often stifled for harmonies sake and to blend in its potential can go unrealized. The issue isn #8217;t IQ but understanding abstracts. I notice that it seems simpler for INTPs to understand them in not necessarily the same way but draw the same conclusions as INFJ. This is because of Ti and intuition ie understanding abstracts and having an actual interest in them. The response with the IQ was merely to show an ENTP that just because an INFJ doesn #8217;t share insight with him doesn #8217;t mean the INFJ has no insight. INFJs feel misunderstood it takes trust and being accepted for an INFJ to share. I have to eat dinner now but I will look at what else you wrote hon right after. I #8217;m not getting these sequentially but I glanced. I will make sure I read them and respond.  #128525;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Creating a better future by helping people see what they have already within them. Having insights and sharing with people who utilize these insights. Creating a better future for future generations. INFJs do this in small ways but understand cause and effect in ways that many won #8217;t see or understand. But the INFJ sees them and sees the changes. The want that INFJs have is for people to love one another. Global unity. This is often the source for our ideals. INFJs prefer doing this covertly but the Goal spans multiple generations. Pretty much a guarantee that INFJs who are willing make changes in small ways that create big changes for future generations. Often not expected to be observed and not perceived in our lifetimes even. INFJs vary in how far reaching vision is but it is about the future. You will never know the changes that were created by INFJs who do this covertly because the event is prevented. There #8217;s nothing to witness when the event is prevented. It #8217;s as if it didn #8217;t exist because it never happened. Success for an INFJ just as the meaning may vary from one person to another is also the case for INFJs. But the future is a consistent focus. Success isn #8217;t monitory.. success is insuring that our ideals have made a difference. Legacy for an INFJ is the people that continue after we #8217;re gone. Rather than some other things we don #8217;t see value in but the world is taught to see value in. We see things in our subjective visions. Every INFJ is as different among ourselves as we are to other people. Each a finger print that is unique. IMO ...  #128578;the success of an INFJ leaving the world a little better of than it would have been. No matter how small the variables have changed and will hopefully continue to have a momentum with people who carry on without us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was being honest. It #8217;s not what I agree with. The OP was looking for truth. I #8217;m an older INFJ and forgive me but my cognitive functions are developed. I had an experience that INFJs are capable of. You won #8217;t fathom honestly. You don #8217;t see that each INFJ has their own subjective Ni. Ti is subjective. If mire INFJs found comfort and their Ni wasn #8217;t stifled out of fear of not being understood.. you were helping INFJs grow and develop their own Dom cognitive function you would understand better that we are not the same to ourselves- meaning our abstracts and symbolism mean something to ourselves. I apologize for not sharing more with you but I don #8217;t receive pleasure in hitting my head against a brick wall. No INFJs enjoy that. That one I can include all of us. All INFJs aren #8217;t the same Good Lord! Have you no clue the range lol. I doubt I #8217;m getting these sequentially my apologies but you #8217;re not the expert though charming as you are. What is an INFJ to you? Is it  #8220;for you #8221;. Everyone has possibilities. I don #8217;t like anyone to be limited. I see no reason to start fires for fires sake. Give it purpose? You ask I answer if you don #8217;t like answers don #8217;t ask. Learn or don #8217;t you #8217;re the smart one. You have no reason to insult when this is why an INFJ wouldn #8217;t be authentic is because of imposed definition by your decision. Holding the mirror isn #8217;t worth it for someone who #8217;s unwilling to look. I see your perspective and you may be young. It #8217;s not a problem the youth but seeing patterns and the larger picture isn #8217;t your forte #8217; at this time. Don #8217;t limit the INFJ you know by marring her perspectives of who she is .. she should have that right. You really don #8217;t understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. Yes and we must continue to learn. Perhaps things will morph in what our conclusions of them are. But teaching is sharing and learning. We must never stop learning. We tend to guide but it is within them. Help them to see what they possess within themselves. We are here a short while and we change things often with intention for it to be carried on without us. This is a level of trust. It isn #8217;t up to us but is up to them. It requires trust on both sides. Love one another. Look further ahead. I think one of our problems is that we think of concentric thinking concentrically. It #8217;s a contradiction I #8217;m guilty of. Still learning  #128521;. I despise concentric thinking. It is one of the banes of our existence as human beings. But with some distance I see this in itself is concentric thinking. However it #8217;s our ideals that drive us so I won #8217;t separate from this drive but it #8217;s important to understand it and be really honest with ourselves.  #8220;We #8221;are all of us responsible. And every human being has much to learn. It kills me how divided people are. Like frequency attracts like frequency. Anger breeds anger, hate breeds hate. Love loves love. Set examples.  #8220; We #8221; means everyone.  #8220;We #8221; have to be on the same team to set an example of being on the same team. Global unity won #8217;t happen in our lifetime but we set the momentum to be carried on. And  #8220;We #8221; isn #8217;t just us. It feels like it #8217;s on our shoulders. It #8217;s on everyone #8217;s shoulders.  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039;. I definitely think we can be a team lovely.</TEXT>

But if you ask any INFJ and they give you an honest answer.. we have a very clear picture of  #8220;what we want to see #8221; in the world and the future of humanity. It #8217;s our ideals yes but it #8217;s also ideals we want to have mirrored. It will be different with each INFJ too lolol. JBH.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are going to be times in your life where you get along with this type or that type. It #8217;s likely to change. Development has a role in this not just being INFJ. It would be good to look into enneagram. And also observe what you #8217;re drawn to. You #8217;re correct in everything you said. It #8217;s really hard for us. We #8217;re totally capable of having a long lasting deep relationship but because we often feel misunderstood we accept this and do just what you said. Intuitives are drawn to me that #8217;s nice  #128514;. Mostly NFs as you say. Supposedly the golden pair is INFJ + INTP. I #8217;ve had some friends when I was younger (I #8217;m 49 btw) INTPs and we got along great. Obviously though it depends on more than type. I get along really well with INFPs and INTPs currently and INTJ  #8216;usually #8217; haha. Edit: having difficulty with ENTP lately. But some ENTPs are great. Timing obviously plays a role in this. There are many factors. My best friend is INFP and we were a couple in the 90s.. we #8217;re still great friends. You #8217;ll find that even your own type there will be times you #8217;re drawn to one another and in synch and other times not. It #8217;s complex for us. We #8217;re abstract. Honestly I find that we #8217;re an acquired taste. Ni has a way of having this response  #8220;I don #8217;t know what it is about... #128525; #8221; OR  #8220;I don #8217;t know what it is about... #129300; #8221; Adding to it how we really crave that genuine connection and our development and also their development. Such as enneagram. There are factors. It can be tough NGL. One day I #8217;ll be understood or am I dreaming ? lol. I wish you the best sweetheart. Yes we #8217;re all in this boat but it can happen! I hope it does for you.  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. The thing is it #8217;s because we #8217;re deficient it doesn #8217;t make us better just a bit more normal. For whatever reason we don #8217;t have enough. It certainly isn #8217;t a cure. It #8217;s a small fraction of the reason for our symptoms. We also don #8217;t make enough of the body #8217;s natural pain killers and I #8217;ve seen people take painkillers and they just get worse. Hang in there I know it really isn #8217;t fair; having more pain and we have to take less for it. Cherish feeling better when you can. It does get better but not the kind of better that people are used too. I think that #8217;s what people don #8217;t really understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand and I was asked by an ENTP who I misinterpreted and had mistaken. I don #8217;t doubt your perspective. I #8217;m coming from a 2w1 perspective though which magnifies my type.. I can #8217;t help that. And like other INFJs though by no means all I #8217;ve had an experience of being in the love and light- it isn #8217;t a metaphor. It #8217;s more typical when the Ni is fully developed. I #8217;m likely older and this is no offense to your age intended but intuition and other cognitive functions commonly develop more as we age. Most of my perspective has to do with my enneagram though; my development. Ni is our dom function and it requires inner journey to develop it and experience it. I will delete my former comment and will likely delete this one too.  #128514;. I mean you nor any other INFJs or ENTPs any hard feelings. I respect your perspective. But it is also obvious you are not an enneagram 2w1 INFJ and not as abstract. Every INFJ has their own ideals and they may have to do with humanity and the future but they are not the same nor are they all meant for the good of mankind. Some by obvious perspectives of our history are just the opposite. So to at least a small degree you misinterpret what I mean. He was wanting a comparison by his standards so I was providing the opposite from his which is a very wide range. So you have confused this as being the only perspective intended. I have many. We are subjective dear INFJ. You disagreeing with the opposite end of the spectrum only confirms the point that a INFJs want to have ideals mirrored. But here #8217;s the thing.. we have our own and the world can #8217;t  #8220;possibly #8221; be what each view that we have is. This is logic. You would probably agree better on some of the more realistic things that I #8217;ve shared with OP. This wasn #8217;t for the OP this was a response to an ENTP that was at the other end of the spectrum. My intention was for 2 reasons. 1. to provide a range of perspectives by going to the other end. 2. To defend INFJs who are limited by limiting Ni something that generally isn #8217;t our fault as we #8217;re taught it #8217;s not acceptable. Sometimes rather early in life. You misinterpret because what you see here is out of context and wasn #8217;t for OP. It was to create a scale by means of opposites. And quite frankly I was having a bad day #128514;. But accepted my mistakes and moved on. It #8217;s alright to have different perspectives. It #8217;s how we learn. You were stating in generalizations for INFJs also. We are contradictions lmao! But I mean you know insult. I truly wish you well and hope you have the life you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Edit sorry typos BTW I was just looking over what you said again to see another perspective and you were on point. That was the point to have the wide range.  #128514;. That was the point lol. You think ahead right? What would the point be for me to write what I wrote? Ok when you further develop Ni the other cognitive functions develop. I honestly tend to look at people #8217;s cognitive functions it isn #8217;t about type. People are variables. I like to understand cognitive processes. I #8217;m not saying your Ni isn #8217;t developed I really can #8217;t gage by our interaction here it wouldn #8217;t be accurate or fair. I know you #8217;re using logic. You are looking at things (realistically right? Other cognitive functions develop more when Ni develops it makes no difference where we are in development. We are people and people are variables and have a very  #8220;wide range #8221;  #128518;. MBTI is only the tip of the iceberg. I do personally think it #8217;s important for INFJs to develop Ni. It #8217;s our dom cognitive function for Gods sake! The others develop further as well. For whatever reason I don #8217;t like it when people try to cap its development for my fellow INFJs. I know it can be hard to do when it is shunned by the real world. I honestly don #8217;t have an issue with you or anyone really. It #8217;s abstract there isn #8217;t anyone person to blame for INFJs stifling the development of Ni etc. but I don #8217;t have to like it lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. We can share sometime. There are experiences and reasons for it. I want to say you are not wrong also. We can #8217;t fix people; what we can do is help them to fix it for themselves if it #8217;s something they want. Spending time with someone to fix them especially if it #8217;s something they are unwilling to or not wanting to change is draining. What you said is right. There are ways to give our energy that are more fruitful and less draining. Fe has to be around people that aren #8217;t going to take advantage of you.

    <TEXT>I agree with you absolutely. It #8217;s genetic however so some of your biological family will have it too though usually different synesthesia. This #8217;ll sound weird haha but you should possibly look into MBTI but don #8217;t pay attention to the stereotypes and hype. But INFJs have been around a lot longer than MBTI  #128521;. You have a mind adept to being capable of understanding patterns and you have theories. INFJ often have synesthesia. Synesthesia is genetic. It #8217;s more than personality type that connects us. You are at least an intuitive IMO. I really enjoyed your post! And I think that it is more common than people realize to have synesthesia and not know it. People have their own perceptions only to compare it with so how would they know that their perceptions are different? Also teens are more likely to entertain more possibilities than some adults are. Teens are on a path for self discovery that some adults have decided that they already know enough lol. Teens are going to be more honest generally speaking. It isn #8217;t that adults aren #8217;t honest but they don #8217;t have this door as open.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ironically it #8217;s our Fe that #8217;s the source for this. I don #8217;t feel this way but there are times that I know this energy. Fe and there not being enough Fe in the world around us makes others seem selfish because compared to Fe it is the case. But they wouldn #8217;t understand this because it isn #8217;t the same lens that they see through. We #8217;re born with this lens. It stands to reason that the care and feeling for others is mostly taught to others and it #8217;s through their perspectives of why often having to do with their own experiences. Where as we just feel it. We experience them in which case they think about their perspectives. It seems selfish to us. Then adding to it that regardless of our idealism we see the darkness of humanity that they avoid seeing. It isn #8217;t something we want to see lol. But they are oblivious and seeing patterns as we do we #8217;re aware how people don #8217;t seem to learn. This spans mans existence not only lifetimes. This being said our ideals for many of us is to bring light into the world. Help people to find their own light and truth. Love. Global unity. If we were just disappointed in them it would be easier really but it runs deeper in that. It feels like failing. It #8217;s hard to keep our spirits up when we see what #8217;s going on and a lot of people don #8217;t have a clue and some don #8217;t even want to. Meanwhile it #8217;s staring us in the face. I most often keep the most positive outlook I can but INFJs are both romantic and realists it sounds funny because we #8217;re so damn idealistic but we see better than most what #8217;s happening , what has been happening and  #8220;what will happen #8221; it #8217;s a lot on our shoulders. But it isn #8217;t really all on us but we feel like we have to take responsibility because who will? But honestly it #8217;s on everyone #8217;s shoulders. We just see the ramifications past lifetimes and centuries while many people think about the here and now and even then don #8217;t even (want) to see what #8217;s really happening. It #8217;s an abstract really. The  #8220;one #8221; to blame is everyone. It #8217;s hard for some people to begin to wrap their heads around this . We #8217;re all responsible. Some people get it though I swear. I find them all the time. It #8217;s just frustrating when at times there #8217;s no one to be found. I get it. Sorry  #128532;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Egyptians were obsessed about the cycle of life and death. Then adding to this the fact that artifacts were discovered during this time. This was very big news and it was reflected in almost every form of art as well as fashion. One of the fascinations I have with this time period is that there are the designs of nature and the transition to an industrial revolution. But looking it over you can see the diversity. Perhaps the old silent scary movies gave the Gothic design more of the darker connotation in itself. This was a time when beauty was seen in many facets of existence and history then adding this with humor and with truth lol they drank absinthe, opium etc... this is likely a part of the uniqueness at the time. Think about it? It #8217;s obvious, beautiful nonetheless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as a type 2 is concerned it will look quite a bit different depending on the wing that you have. I #8217;m also INFJ and have had a unique experience with my enneagram. No need to go into that really but you #8217;ll understand that I #8217;m aware of the similarities. I #8217;m 2w1. 2w3s are better known as giver and 2w1s are helpers. A 4 is also a heart center but can have a wing in a head center. Honestly INFJs tend to be rather head and heart IMO anyway. I also always have tested INFJ but my enneagram has changed. A 2 is based in sadness and is all about love. It isn #8217;t an  #8220;easy #8221; enneagram for an INFJ but it is really close to our nature. I would have to ask you what is most important to you in life. And also have you consider your wings. For 2 it #8217;ll be 1 and 3. For 4 it #8217;ll be 5 and 3. See if the wings can help clear this up for you and if not let me know and I #8217;ll work on this with you.  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol I agree with everything. And yes it is a broad a statement. There are also different types of 2s, 4s etc.. social, sexual and self preservation. Unfortunately this doesn #8217;t narrow your possibilities but adds to it still it may help and funny thing I thought that if you were a 2 you #8217;d have a wing in 1 and if you were a 4 you #8217;d have a wing in 5. As far as what you want in life.. it isn #8217;t as broad as it sounds because it #8217;s core based. It wouldn #8217;t necessarily tell me the meaning but it would let me know what you are not for to a degree. If you have developed Ti you are more likely 4w5. If you are very developed Fe 2w1 would likely be more correct. I have developed Ti but I was a 5w6. I had an experience you may appreciate seeing you seek enlightenment. Because of my experience and because of my nature I became a 2w1. My Ti hasn #8217;t really changed but my Ni Ti loops have changed. Not to my pleasure lol. But for INFJ 5s NiTi loops bring knowledge and insight. So do you feel like you benefit from them? Or do to dislike them. As a 2 I can tell you that I don #8217;t care for them  #128514;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. In the heart center enneagram Ni Ti loops don #8217;t seem very beneficial where as in the head center they were beneficial. NiTi loops are intense and long lasting for INFJ 5s but they provide insight the more answers the more questions and so on. But for an INFJ2 Ni Ti loops tend to be more unpleasant, short and less fruitful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. Motivation.. what motivates what we do, feel and think? It #8217;s a good way of looking at it. Then looking for the source. It #8217;s the way we choose to work with a universal insecurity of not being enough that is the base of sadness,fear and anger. We are very much alike underneath it all. The motivation/development is our enneagram and this is a way to understand differences as well as see how we are alike. Differences are our incompleteness but we can learn from them and hopefully grow and evolve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So types that lead with intuition are... INFJ-Ni, INTJ-Ni, ENFP-Ne, ENTP Ne. These should be your primary to consider. Some of the types that I #8217;ve seen that develop more cognitive functions ( and honestly you may be one of those that has more cognitive functions in their stack ie more cognitive functions stacks ) are INFP, INTP, ENTP and INFJ. This being said there are ways for any type to develop cognitive functions. People are variables. Adding to this that age/more time and experience can alter developments as well. INFJ here by the way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it #8217;s hard for some Christians to admit having been taught the wrong way. I can understand it to a degree because it is a belief system and I don #8217;t doubt that Christians love Christ. But following Christ and being Christian aren #8217;t the same thing. I #8217;m sure there are many Christians who follow Christ #8217;s teachings but there are many many more that follow a church and nearly forgetting the teachings of love and unity. We are all responsible and we are one. We are the one responsible for the animals and the planet. So long as we have time here. The problem I see a lot is that this seems to be to abstract for people to really grasp. Decent people throw their hands up because there is no one to blame. That #8217;s where we get it wrong. We #8217;re in this together. We #8217;re all responsible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Twins have life altering experience. Believe it or not most twins don #8217;t have a romantic or physical bond. They go though stages at different times. It #8217;s rare for twins to be ready. They can be different ages, different sexual orientations, different geographically. All the romantic and sexual hype about twins is not what twin flames are about. And just because someone is your twin doesn #8217;t mean they are good for you. Change isn #8217;t gentle. A bond with a twin exists with or without distance. You feeling your twin can mean that you are twins. There #8217;s something magnetic about twins both positive and repulsive. Some twins do fall in love and are both ready at the same time. Death doesn #8217;t separate them, not death, not time and space. Often a twin is meant to help you evolve spiritually. If twins are ready to be together platonic, romantic, physical none of that matters. It has to do with helping others. Here #8217;s the thing even twins that are both ready are going to reflect each other to each other. It isn #8217;t pleasant sometimes. Because you reflect the best and the worst of your twin to them.And they reflect the best and the worst of you to you. It can be a very good tool for growth but it isn #8217;t pleasant to reflect your twin sometimes. Did you have experience like that with her in high school? If this sounds familiar she may be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you explained that you need time alone to recharge? Rather than it being socially related perhaps they could better understand it that way. Explaining that extroverts gain energy around people and introverts lose energy around people. Introverts gain energy alone and extroverts lose energy alone. This all being said my children and spouse don #8217;t quite understand it because in their company they see me more on the extroverted spectrum. Though not very extroverted they don #8217;t see the introversion. My spouse doesn #8217;t understand how sometimes I need to be around people and sometimes I need quiet. He had a stroke though and he used to understand and be more introverted. He #8217;s ENFP. My daughter is ENFP. I think the perception they have is influenced by their Fi. It #8217;s difficult to see others perspectives. Honestly it has caused problems in that the times I say I need time I #8217;m not listened too because they don #8217;t really know what that means or why I should need it .. quite literally. My best friend INFP is great! But .. he gets upset sometimes if I don #8217;t call and he try #8217;s to get me outside but he understands. If your parents are extroverted they probably won #8217;t really understand because they can #8217;t identify with it from their perspective. But perhaps the rationality of the gain and loss of energy would get through to them and perhaps they wouldn #8217;t take it so personally. It #8217;s difficult for extroverts to understand especially because we can seem somewhat extroverted so they probably take it as being down. Thinking something is wrong. It may be concern on their part. If you assure them that it #8217;s normal like you have been and explain how you are to a degree both but that you need time alone to  #8220;recharge #8221; they might get it. But you #8217;re not alone in this it #8217;s one of those things we have to deal with. It #8217;s especially hard for them because how would they know if something is wrong and at times it may be. Parents are going to worry. It is their nature to care about you if they are good parents. So try explaining it but understand it #8217;s  #8220;normal #8221; for parents to be that way and that they just can #8217;t tell if it #8217;s something or not. I hope something here helps and I hope it improves. Keep well and safe  #128578;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahahaha that was my thought too. I love love function and form together though. Some people are form over function and some are function over form but my favorite is a balance of the two. Often when I make gifts it is something that is both. Something that has purpose and something that can be involved daily. This is perfect for a gift.  #128149;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Especially with suicide. The feeling of being so alone, lonely and helpless. The desperation and resolve that some one gets to that point and the dark place they felt they could not escape and did not return from. The reason I think the sorrow is different is because it #8217;s not only sorrow for the death but sorrow for their soul.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I #8217;m to be honest it #8217;s been more evident for me lately. So many events in the world and things happening beyond our control. I think that #8217;s just as much an INFJ problem as it is a 2 problem. You #8217;re doing great. This is a really rough time for many people. You are aware. It is going to spill out from time to time. Because a 2 is very close to the nature of INFJ. We feel others. And the Ni and Fe ; we pick up the energies. Ti and Ni is problem solving. The Fe and Ti. You are close to your nature. The best thing to do is forgive yourself. Wether you #8217;ve done anything wrong or not.. forgive. The will to make a difference and the feeling of insignificance is a part of who we are it is contradiction I know. Just forgive and trust yourself. It is a way to help. I don #8217;t know if you #8217;re 2w3 or 2w1..but we #8217;re going to have this to tend with from time to time. I get it. I soo get it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Free will my friend. It is a double edged sword because although we have capabilities we do not truly understand the ramifications. The tree of knowledge is a metaphor. The desire to see ourselves as God is the suffering we have subjected ourselves to. We may have knowledge but lack wisdom. We have knowledge but do not perceive the results of our actions nor are we aware in life. It is our doing and our desires to see ourselves concentrically; meaning humankind has a strong tendency to think that we are the center of the universe and it exists because of us. It does not. It was created before us. By God.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What were the ways that the two of you would communicate before you were married? What problems did you have before you were married? It #8217;s likely that both of you had more patience. It #8217;s likely that the day to day stress the two of you experience is half the trouble. My advice for whatever it #8217;s worth is for both of you to be easier going. Also if you haven #8217;t already.. learn what Your enneagrams are. Enneagram is development and it will help each other with communication and understanding each other better. As far as depth goes it #8217;s possible that discussion of why the two of you are the way you are regarding development may be a way to achieve a deeper connection; you would both be learning about yourselves and each other. Try not to be critical. Being critical could shut down the process. Development is a touchy subject especially when discussing the source. Take your time. It #8217;s difficult right now with the pandemic. When things are different spend time doing some of the things that brought the two of you together. Nature your dreams together. I wish the best for both of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes honey. I #8217;m sorry. They do not know what they do not know. I suppose it has something to do with going with what they see. Where as we look for the unseen. I #8217;m glad you have someone who really sees you though. I think that people would make an effort if they realized it was needed and they care for you but realizing it #8217;s needed is difficult for them if they take things at face value and take it for granted that they already know (and they don #8217;t) simply some people no matter how dear they are to you are reluctant because they already have a definition of you in their mind. Yes it #8217;s disheartening but part of this is our fault. How many times does someone ask if everything #8217;s Ok and we say Ok or fine? Sometimes we don #8217;t make it easy. Also as they fear what they do not know we fear what we know. For example generally we have gone through scenarios of how we #8217;ll be received and are pretty correct. Often that is the hold back. Perhaps we #8217;re not sharing enough and then when we do it #8217;s too much. It #8217;s a balance. Baby steps... people will surprise you sometimes. I think it #8217;s tough for us because we take it personally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me I think it #8217;s spatial. But it #8217;s possible that intuitives and synesthetes see passed the illusion. I #8217;m INFJ with synesthesia and this with other optical tricks and abstract images I see the patterns pretty simultaneously. For example there #8217;s a test that a spot disappears but I see it. It has to do with different sides of the brain. The dot seems to disappear during the pause from one side to the other but being bilateral it doesn #8217;t disappear. But I think it #8217;s a part of synesthesia ie having more connections in the brain. It was brought up that Scitzopbhranics can #8217;t see this illusion which started my mind wondering what the common denominator is. Intuition and pattern recognition is linked to the unconscious mind.. perhaps that #8217;s the common denominator.. but then I thought perhaps it #8217;s the connections themselves. So I decided to find out if synesthetes see it similarly. It stands to reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I looked at this I immediately saw the opposing spiral lines in the circles then I immediately moved the (larger one I think to the left) and the smaller one left in place. It was 2 circles and this was all pretty much at once. Not something conscious.. I simply observed. I could go back and allow my self to see the illusion but it was much easier to see the 2 circles. The process was less than a couple seconds. Often how I see abstract symbolism with my introverted intuition. It #8217;s rather the abstract images moving slightly and slowly or it #8217;s like a very fast silent movie. I don #8217;t necessarily think that all intuitives would see it this same way but intuitively I thought of synesthetes especially synesthetes that are intuitives.

    <TEXT>I suppose I see it more abstractly but I can identify with the universe observing itself. I suppose that #8217;s abstract as well lol. Connection is very important. But the ideals of the self concerning the world can at times bring immense loneliness. Sometimes what people find as inadmissible is love and compassion. It doesn #8217;t have to be in relation to the self but an observation. People share ideals openly and positively learn from one another. Disharmony in the external world can be disheartening. Basically what I #8217;m trying to say is.. it may be what we ourselves find inadmissible that causes the loneliness rather than what others regard as inadmissible. This isn #8217;t entirely negative. Yes the loneliness is unpleasant to put it mildly. But it #8217;s loneliness that is a drive to make change in the world. It isn #8217;t necessarily negative. I agree with the communication aspects he refers too. Yes it is isolating to be misunderstood there is no doubt. But a lot of our problem is anticipating not being understood wether it is wrong or right that we #8217;ll be understood. The loneliness is loss of faith; loss of hope. It is an impermanent feeling yet that is something every human being faces. It is more about faith in humanity rather than oneself. I admit it isn #8217;t black and white as this. When I say  #8220;Never lose faith. #8221; I don #8217;t necessarily mean in oneself or in religion but not to lose faith in people. In humanity... it is tough at times but it is important.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re description does sound like ENFP but the about 50 I/E and about 50 P/J seems a little grey. Yes self care is your own needs. It #8217;s interesting that you feel it #8217;s superficial. But I suppose it #8217;s the 2 development. I #8217;m glad you have self care  #128525;. You sound wonderfully sweet. The reason people say that about 2s is that we don #8217;t like to admit we have them. I #8217;m not completely 100% that you #8217;re ENFP but I don #8217;t doubt it. I am sure however that you are a 2 100%. We don #8217;t like to admit that we have needs to ourselves. So not seeing them is normal. Because the focus is on others it seems that that is the worth.  #8220;Treat yourself as you would treat others. #8221; Is a good way to look at it. And something that is important for INFJs as well. Not easy.. for 2s connection is so important. Love is important. I understand how other things pale in comparison. I think that one of the reasons that 2s are told to take care of your needs is because it #8217;s easy to forget our own needs especially when the focus is on love and care for others. It #8217;s about love. Sadness is the base and inability to at times be edit: see our own needs is actually pride. I know it doesn #8217;t seem that way. Because focus is on others. You are delightful. I wish you all the best. Xoxo  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>INFJ 2w1 here. Yes. There #8217;s a few things going on here. One of which is seeing oneself is uncomfortable lol. I think that to a degree it is learned behavior. A desire for harmony and being used to being misunderstood INFJs try to compensate by over explaining. The thing is... INFJs are as different to one another as we are to others. We #8217;re at different stages of development as well. Add to this that Ti comes across coldly. And in writing we don #8217;t have the person to really relate our Fe to. The longing to be understood is especially focused among our fellow INFJs. But we #8217;re very subjective. A hypothetical.. what if we all got together to change the world? We all want to change the world. The world could never be what we all want it to be because each of us have our own ideals. So we look for areas of agreement. That is doable. As we can see through people we can see through one another so perhaps the glossing over that is meant to ease someone is very transparent to one another. I can see your perspective. I think a lot of it though is seeing oneself. As you say you realize that you #8217;re this way in life. It may not be comfortable seeing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The odd thing is typically we INFJs all want the same things in a close relationship. Soul connection, depth and understanding. Even if we don #8217;t show how romantic we are at heart we are tremendously romantic. We can cover it up with rationality but when we let go it #8217;s intense. The relationship need not be intense because in our eyes it will be intense. The caution we have is developed early because of the awareness of our ideals. But ideally  #128521;love has no limits. So deep down that is what we want. Boundless love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you know your INFJs enneagram? It does make a difference in how you should possibly approach this. But typically what other INFJs here have said is true. Alone time is necessary to recharge and don #8217;t feel badly if this is difficult to gage. I don #8217;t know many people that understand it. Some INFJs won #8217;t tell you when they need you. So your wanting to be there is important and trust me it #8217;s noticed. Sometimes it #8217;s a matter of not wanting to trouble anyone. Sometimes it #8217;s feeling that we #8217;re not going to be understood. But you trying will make a difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are wonderfully sweet. Greater change in the future depends on small changes in the past. Meaning it requires a head start. The further away the future is the more variables the greater chances are to make change. The closer to the momentum of fate we are the more limited we are. It isn #8217;t on any ones shoulders it #8217;s on all of our shoulders. It requires being willing to accept that we won #8217;t see the changes. It #8217;s for a future beyond ours. Small changes make greater change. Being face to face with our fate is futile. But looking further there are many possibilities. Many possibilities = more chance for change. You are already doing it.  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your response is valid  #128522;. There #8217;s a universal problem. Close to the core development of our ego there is a feeling of not being enough. The truth is we aren #8217;t enough. We are the missing pieces of one another. As one as souls we are perfect. Separately as humans we are imperfect. Every human being has a lot to learn. We learn by obstacles. It helps to a degree to make people feel they are enough but really we #8217;re not. You #8217;re perspective is valid and I can see how it applies. But it doesn #8217;t apply to everyone in the way you think it does. We are unhappy with ourselves but it #8217;s not my take that the unhappiness of a world we live in is something to conform to the world. That isn #8217;t the answer and it makes little change for our world. Its action that begins with vision that changes the future and supports change. It #8217;s nonconforming oneself individually. Yes people will attempt to adjust to their ideals. We #8217;re here to learn and we learn by obstacles. The thing is we create these obstacles. I agree with you people are unhappy with themselves.. sadness fear and anger are different ways of dealing with the same insecurity of not being enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>God isn #8217;t human. However what you mention is about transformation. This is an extremely human spiritual perspective that has as much to do with it #8217;s starting point as it does where it ends. This is a spiritual approach. The journey is the focus. I agree and approve of this although we have a tremendous ways to go yet we will not be God. It is human nature to see God as human and it is egocentric. It is concentric thinking and we as humans are all guilty of this to some degree. This is why we can never be God. If we evolved past this perspective we wouldn #8217;t be God. We would see unity but we would never be conscious of everything. To do so wouldn #8217;t be us. There was a time.. a style when painters painted their own face on to the people in the painting. It is human nature to draw our own familiarities and attach our own identity. Subconsciously if not consciously. Our minds aren #8217;t designed to perceive time as it is. Unable to perceive all of God let alone be God.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ESTP interesting... according to this you are an intuitive dom. From what I #8217;ve seen of the sakinorva test is that it confuses people but if you look at the correlations of the other cognitive functions it #8217;s generally quite accurate. A way to distinguish your dom cognitive processes is to look at the sums as well. It would be good to bring enneagram into this process. It helps with the variables. Your thinking runs close but it is secondary both individually and as a sum ie Ne+Ni is a higher sum than Ti and Te. Intuitive Doms are INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, and ENFP. You #8217;re an NT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It hasn #8217;t stopped. Miracles still happen. There are still prophets. People still experience God in life. The teaching of religion has actually stifled people from seeing it. The wrong teachings. Following Christ and being Christian are often two very different things. There are Christians that follow Christ but they are not one in the same. Jesus was spiritual not religious. Jesus wanted people to love one another. Many that aren #8217;t accepted in religion Jesus would welcome. The problem is the intuitionalism and involvement with human beings not encouraging a connection with God from within. Something else to consider is that prophets are nearly never accepted in societies during their lifetimes. It would be no different today. The connection with God is found within; not in a book or a building or someone else but within. The soul and souls soul. Underneath it all we are one as souls. A problem with religions is that people  #8220;use #8221; it. Often use it to fit their own means and control people making the relationship about people telling people what to believe in and interfering with a relationship with God. Christianity isn #8217;t what Jesus has in mind because it is misused. The relationship is with God and to please God. Love one another. Jesus wanted to please and serve God. How man has it so confused that they think that God is to serve us. God isn #8217;t our maid. We have this on all our shoulders. So the question perhaps shouldn #8217;t be why does God no longer talk to man but why man no longer talks to God. Loves God, Gives to God, Loves all Gods creations and give thanks instead of asking God for things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It helps to understand the way a 5 shows affection. Sharing knowledge is a form of affection. If you tune that out and or show little interest a 5 takes it personally because of the relationship; it #8217;s like rejection and will likely be reasoning for not sharing. When a 5 shares with you it #8217;s affection. You are important.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes absolutely. It was a tough lesson to learn especially in the beginning. I suppose many of us were used to giving 150%.. because we still are. I wonder how many of us were perfectionists before fibromyalgia? Now what is considered normal is perfection. There is beauty in imperfections. It #8217;s easy to get wrapped up in the 150% mark and we all tend to beat ourselves up over it. That isn #8217;t what life is about. Thanks for the reminder. We often take the pain and weakness we feel and blame ourselves even subconsciously. But we are not our own enemy. We didn #8217;t choose this.

    <TEXT>I saw the pandemic coming. Before it hit the states I was already thinking about indigenous people and the effect on animals. Now people are talking about these things. As if it just occurred to them. This is because people think of themselves within their own perimeter. Problems that are relevant currently I was thinking about half a year ago. Because people think concentrically there was no way to help anyone. People panic and hoard. People think within the perimeters of their own lives. Early on people wearing or (not wearing) masks were thinking about themselves getting sick rather than spreading it. As if it only had to do with them. Many people didn #8217;t have compassion for people in China. The fact is unless people think globally as one there will be no way to change the momentum of fate. You are right. Here I am thinking about the future and people are groping with issues that were front and center early on for me. It does make me sound like an ass. The thing is so many people truly want the world to be different but these changes won #8217;t be seen until people think further ahead as well as have compassion for people that are further than our own backyard so to speak. We are one. It #8217;s on all our shoulders. And even if people are successful we won #8217;t see the results because if all goes well it won #8217;t be changes in our lives but future generations that can further change. That #8217;s the problem people have myself included is that it #8217;s hard to accept that we won #8217;t see the change yet there will be change. People want a quick fix. That is another issue lol. So the point is the past is foundation and there are patterns. It may be difficult perhaps for people to comprehend but this is fractal. To influence fate it takes a further distance to change it. A head start. The further away the more variables there are and the more chance of change. Variables create more variables. Thinking concentrically, not having compassion for people in other countries until it is in our own countries and not thinking further ahead, cruelty to animals. This is how we got in the mess we #8217;re in. And it #8217;s on all of our shoulders. Instead of thinking the universe revolves around us we need to think further ahead, have compassion for all creation, Think globally.. As one. Someone suffers we suffer. We suffer. We have to think about a future other than what we get out of it. It is a cycle and unless we want to keep repeating the cycle we have to think further ahead. Make small changes that create greater change in the future. I #8217;m not thinking of the future so much as the futures future these days. Because this is fate. Cause and effect. And the state if the world isn #8217;t going to be straightened out in our life time. Acceptance. Here is some foundation. Change creates more change, variables create more variables. It requires a head start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting you should reply now it #8217;s been 171 days. A lot has happened since then. But no worries. Ego death isn #8217;t what you hear it is because what you generally hear of are drug induced states of consciousness. Mine wasn #8217;t that. Yes in life we have ego. In life we are all of us flawed. What I was speaking of or rather what I was experiencing is the soul and souls soul. No existing is not always to please the ego. Yes... it is suffering to live. It is a sacrifice to live. We #8217;re here to learn. We #8217;re one. Here in life there is a separation.. we are all of us fallible. We aren #8217;t enough. Deep down we are aware of this. It #8217;s a universal insecurity. And it isn #8217;t enough to make people feel they are enough though it helps. We are the missing pieces of one another. We learn by obstacles. If you knew what I knew you would understand how it is a sacrifice to live. There are no short cuts though. There are other places than where I #8217;ve been. The afterlife... The solitude of darkness  #8220;is peaceful #8221; to me. But for someone that couldn #8217;t let go the solitude is painful. People can be content in darkness but it isn #8217;t the love and light. We all have our demons don #8217;t we? Mine is at the core of development intertwined with my ego. ( yes I have one #128514;.) the base of my development is sadness. My mother committed suicide and it cuts me very deep. But that has to do with my feelings. My sadness, my grief. I don #8217;t want people to suffer like she has. Ideally as many would of my kind .. I want love in the world but that is an ideal.. I #8217;m aware. I don #8217;t expect to see change in my life in the world. But we need to make a momentum for change. It #8217;s subtle and it is faith. Because we will not see it it is necessary to look further ahead. Nothing.. doing nothing, not having compassion for those outside of our own perimeter, disrespect for life.. this is how human beings get in the mess we #8217;re in. Nothing is not the answer.  #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;lol. You can opt for nothing in death. But this do nothing is bullshit.  #128513;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok.. I #8217;m only 36 minutes into this video and it #8217;s something you may find interesting. Hatshepsuts family appear to have had the same skin problems. The archeologists have been making a composite ( that #8217;s interesting too ) but they are coming to the conclusion that it was genetic.. so the question is at this point was it genetic so they were using the ointment or was the skin problem because of the ointment??[Secrets of Egypt #8217;s lost Queen ](https://youtu.be/_SgUiJUNv7E) I #8217;m sending it now and will watch the rest of it tomorrow going to bed now but I think it #8217;s interesting. This sort of thing happened with makeup too if you recall. Europe/European royalty. People wore the makeup and there skin began to get worse.. people wore more makeup to  #8220;cover their skin #8221; and it became worse. A cycle. The Egyptian family with Hatshepsut span generations so it #8217;s reasonable that it was genetic.. so was Hatshepsut the only one using the ointment or was this passed down through generations??</TEXT>

Yes we are the Big Bang well a part of it.but this is a different stage obviously. We are a part of the universe. But we are not the universe. There is always more than what we see. The universe is a cycle. Time isn #8217;t linear.. the Alpha and Omega are one. Everything is not black and white. Dualism is a human concept. There is dark and light you are correct but it is a mix. Dark and light are one. I understand the feeling you have it #8217;s existential dread as well as an awareness of destruction. Your perspective is correct because there are many perspectives that are correct. You are looking at specific areas. There is a cycle I #8217;ve known of since little it #8217;s the cycle of creation and destruction. We looking at a different part of the elephant. I #8217;m going to read you other replies now.

    <TEXT>Just to clear something up possibly that wasn #8217;t making sense to you earlier. When I was explaining the stuff you referred to as different stages of enlightenment that wasn #8217;t my point. I was merely sharing where my perspective is coming from. I #8217;m an intuitive. My dom cognitive function is introverted intuition. Many INFJs are spiritual to put it mildly. Enneagram is development. Cognitive functions are just the way our brains tend to work. In enneagram 5w6 doesn #8217;t become 2w1. My cognitive functions have developed due to age, intuition and understanding abstracts. With my experiences I #8217;ve seen the perspectives of 1-9. This isn #8217;t typical with enneagram but with INFJs it isn #8217;t unheard of. All cognitive functions are used. In the order of my subtype. Leading with introverted intuition. My thinking and feeling have the same sum and I #8217;ve developed introverted sensing as well as extroverted sensing. This may all sound like Greek sorry.. I #8217;m trying. INFJ are Ni Fe Ti Se. introverted intuition, extroverted feeling,introverted thinking and extroverted sensing. INFJ everything subtype is Ni Fe Ti Se Ne Fi Te Si. I #8217;ve always had developed Ti as a INFJ 5 has. But since my experiences the other cognitive functions have developed. I didn #8217;t expect Te and Si Fi. Ne I noticed a while back. The reason I was bringing it up is because there are reasons you may not understand me. Introverted intuition is something most people don #8217;t understand even INFJs. My Thinking and feeling being equal may make it harder. People often use a part of the brain left or right at different times. I use both a lot. Many people are predominately using half. So seeing that INFJs can tend to be very misunderstood I was trying to explain that  #128514;. Undoubtedly being very misunderstood and now making it even worse  #128129; #8205; #9792; #65039;. Basically it #8217;s my fault. If you don #8217;t understand me. You #8217;re not alone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was necessary to develop all cognitive functions and it came in stages. At first after the love and light extroverted sensing developed immediately. It was in the toilet before lol. It has settled but I #8217;ve since developed the other cognitive including Introverted sensing. Both are comparatively low compared to other cognitive functions. With Akashic records/collective consciousness my Ne developed, my Fi self awareness.. my Te and Si extroverted thinking and introverted sensing had to develop because of comparing patterns and also the other cognitive functions developed as a result of my experiences. It wasn #8217;t smooth lol. It was a lot of energy and focus and very heavy. You have no idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Figuring out what the purpose for knowing these things was tough, really tough at times. The pandemic for example. There was no way to change (any) of the course of events and people suffering. That was painful and yes humbling but I realize the purpose was for me to look further into the future. It takes a greater distance to change fate. Change creates change, variables create more variables and make re chances to have change. At some point I realized I was seeing and thinking fractal.

    <TEXT>You need to have some other release. I haven #8217;t done those drugs but know the feeling you have. I think we all do. It #8217;s a touchy subject for me. Because I #8217;ve seen lives destroyed and lives taken away by drugs. Just be careful. Find a way to identify your feelings and let them out. A lot of times that #8217;s most of it just identifying them. Music is great for this. Walking and talking with an earbud in like your talking on the phone but you #8217;re not talking on the phone lol. Writing them down. Talking to a therapist that will sit and listen. I find a lot of answers  #8220;in #8221; questions so just getting the questions out Ni kicks in as well. But something sensory that gets you out of the space you #8217;re in.. an art museum, camping, hiking... volunteering at a state park, animal shelter, batting at a batting range. Try different stuff out. I messed up my knee but those sound pretty fun. Yes I said it the F word FUN. You have to have fun but stay safe. I know of several people that died of drug overdoses. So it #8217;s a touchy subject that I #8217;m not authentically diplomatic about though I can see how at times drugs can have there place. Just be careful. And try please to have some healthier way to get your Se flag out. It #8217;s hard to lose anyone and anyone of us. Keep well and safe and reach out.. We all feel this. It passes it returns at times.. but it will pass.. everything does.</TEXT>

I #8217;m not familiar enough at this point to help with this but it #8217;s definitely worth looking into. If you don #8217;t know your type it would be good to also take different tests to use them for more data to make a tentative conclusion. Also if you are not already.. answer the questions as it regards to the pattern through out your life not what is for the time being. I like your test a lot.  #128513;. You just may be using more cognitive functions is what it looks like.</TEXT>

It #8217;s as if I was channeling their reaction they should be having at that moment. The times I wasn #8217;t mirroring is when I was reading or doing art alone. Lol. Edit: or in an INFJ stare.

It is genuine because we are Fe=extroverted feeling. These are our feelings. We feel others. To act as if we don #8217;t feel them would be fake and disingenuous.

    <TEXT>I wish you well. But you #8217;re thinking other than correcting me lol isn #8217;t INFJ. INFJ see patterns. Cause and effect. The actions are caused by feelings. It isn #8217;t wanting to be like someone it is feeling them. Feeling them. Mostly every human being mirrors. It is how we learn, interact from infancy on. Your denial is not well founded. It isn #8217;t the big picture. Mirroring is human nature. INFJs mirror to connect. INFJs mirror because hey.. can #8217;t help it. It #8217;s hard wired. Hey I #8217;m not saying INFJs can #8217;t develop Fi we absolutely can but any INFJ would understand that mirroring is human nature and YES YOU do it INFJ or not lol. Mirroring is human nature. Ni Fe Ti Se. what you have displayed is niether feeling nor thinking like an INFJ. If you are Ni dom you are either still maturing and or you are INTJ. Ni Te Fi Se. I don #8217;t know why you identify with INFJ. ENTP possibly. Some other type possibly. Or perhaps theirs some other obstruction to your cognitive function and you #8217;re INFJ. I #8217;m not saying you aren #8217;t INFJ only that your cognitive functions that are being observed at the moment aren #8217;t INFJ. There are variables you may be INFJ. Here we are discussing mirroring. I suggest you take a good look in the mirror.  #128521;. It is human nature to mirror. I can feel someone and know I #8217;m feeling  #8220;them #8221;. INFJs feel others. It #8217;s in our primary cognitive functions. It #8217;s simple you understand you don #8217;t need to adopt this perspective but if you #8217;re INFJ you will understand it. It #8217;s simple.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We cannot fully know the infinite even if we witnessed the end and the beginning of the universe. The fact of the matter is there is always more than what we see. Even as souls we will witness God and feel God but we will not see all of God for we are not God. God is everything. No people will not know God in a building or in a book. The connection with God is within each of us. Our soul is connected with all souls.. we are one and apart of Gods energy. We will not fully know the infinite but we will know time more as time actually is. The Alpha and Omega are one. Time is not linear. God #8217;s time is not our time. People have witnessed Heaven, Nirvana, Brahman etc. it isn #8217;t in a book it is within. In life we have speculation. We have various perspectives. No one person is right but there are many rights.. many perspectives. Unification of all perspectives is most accurate. There is no one person right and all others wrong. Because we are human we are all of us fallible because we are separate. As souls we are one. This life is such a small part of what we will experience. We will all be together because we were once together. As souls as one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am going to delete this post here. But I can tell you this is accurate. I #8217;m INFJ as Jung was and I experienced ego death naturally. It has changed the way my brain processes. Optical illusions such as the dots that disappear don #8217;t disappear for me and this is congruent with the timing of ego death. The experience of the love and light changed my development. But I have known since I was a teen that I am bilateral. I have played with these connections and self experimentation. There is something to the left and right brain connection. Also I have synesthesia and I brought this disappearing dot test to synesthetes and for many the dot does not disappear. The dot disappearing has to do with the gap in the switch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand. Ego death came in stages. I #8217;m 50 lol. I #8217;ve had other experiences since. Ego death happened over a year ago. The love and light is raised consciousness. There is no pain there is no body. If there was another foundation it would be that I died and came back  #128514; or that I have a brain tumor lol. INFJs are in some ways more susceptible to ego death. We are very head and heart. Very L+R. It is one of the reasons that INFJs are spiritual and spiritual leaders. I didn #8217;t go searching for this it found me. I was an INFJ A5*5w6 now INFJ T2* 2w1 after ego death. Since my cognitive functions fit the everything subtype.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry just seeing this. On a mobile. I don #8217;t have all the archetypes in the same way. For me that sort of thing is because the human mind interprets in a way that makes sense to the individual. Basically the human mind has limitations of understanding time, dimensions, God. Abstracts. Time isn #8217;t linear. It is one thing to cerebrally know this and quite another to experience it and know it. I didn #8217;t do drugs.. usually ego death is done with drug use the images are constructs though they are abstract. God does not look like Seneca either lol. Have you been in the love and light?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can tell you this. We will never see all of God. There is always more than what we see. The Alpha and Omega are one. As souls we are one. But we will never see all of God. We are a part of Gods energy. The universe is fractal. There is pattern and cycle. When someone has had this experience it becomes very evident that many others have had this experience. It all makes sense. In life we see illusion and separation. Time isn #8217;t linear and what matters is love. Logic has many wholes in it. We have ego in life. I have ego  #128513;. There comes a time that we have to leave the experience behind but trust me the journey isn #8217;t over. It #8217;s just beginning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I don #8217;t promote drugs. A person doesn #8217;t have the skill to continue the journey. It took a year of stages of ego death before I experienced ego death. It was  #8220;work #8221;. I can say there are no shortcuts we must learn from this life what we must. The experience of oneness changes everything. Collective consciousness changes what you know but you will always be learning. Still figuring things out. Humans aren #8217;t very evolved. We haven #8217;t been around very long.. we have a long ways to go all of us. We are like children in an evolutionary sense at very best. Life is preschool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion it is a good idea. Perhaps have someone help edit it. But getting someone to think and have compelling perspectives is something interesting and should show you have something to offer. Something else that helps is trouble shooting. Free write something else that would disprove what you are writing about. The idea here is that in this case anyway you can find the weak spots and address them in your actual essay. It may also allow you to see more perspectives and you will be learning. You have to mostly take your ego out of the equation. Don #8217;t be critical of yourself only allow yourself to be a critic. Good luck hon I wish you all the best with your writing essay  #128522;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok.. debates... I #8217;ve seen 9w1 and 5s this way. But sharing knowledge is affection for 5s. So it isn #8217;t heated it #8217;s about learning and growing with one another. The school teaching is a lovely idea. Helping people that have unusual learning processes is something I #8217;ve always been interested in as well. I also think public schools and their systems are lacking. If you are extremely self taught that is typical for a 5. But I #8217;m not certain 100% on you being a 5. I #8217;m 98% sure you #8217;re not INTJ. I do think you #8217;re an intellectual. Look into INFJ 5s they have developed Ti. And if it doesn #8217;t resonate with you look into enneagram 9w1 or 1w9. 1s tend to be very intellectual as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Redirecting my thought here. I deleted my earlier comment. Any visual from music I haven #8217;t had an issue with but I tend to use it in conjunction with other synesthesia and pattern recognition. So far there hasn #8217;t been negative effects from this however the time that I hear music in everything can at times be maddening. Like when it #8217;s kept me awake or kept me from enjoying company when I #8217;m out having conversation. The stimulus from sound becoming music is hard to explain but when this synesthesia is on its distracting and unpleasant. I can #8217;t stop it ugh. When I was a kid I thought I was dreaming and remembering it. It was like full orchestral music and I used to write music since then I know now it wasn #8217;t dreaming. Full orchestral music made out of what would be environmental sounds for someone else can be highly unpleasant because I #8217;m awake  #128563;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it #8217;s less of a norm. INFJ female here btw. Firstly men are more often Ts. Secondly INTJs are right. What I mean by that is their very truth oriented and Fi is the perspective their logic is filtered through. From their perspective they are actually right. Thirdly.. I suppose to a degree men expect women to be subdued perhaps it #8217;s seen as confrontational because it isn #8217;t what they #8217;re used to. It may seem like a masculine energy or kinda like wolves lol. Direct eye contact aggression. And lastly; this goes for men and women INTJs, Ni Doms have a vibe that is at times quite foreign to people. What happens is people think there #8217;s something odd about them but they don #8217;t know what. I don #8217;t think it #8217;s so much about the oddity as it is that they just can #8217;t put their finger on it. And of course abstract concepts are something many people don #8217;t have interest in. I think people just get the wrong idea because they aren #8217;t familiar with the right idea so to speak. And then it reinforces an INTJs feelings about being away from people because people don #8217;t get it. It #8217;s gotta be aggravating for an INTJ which then adds to the tension. Well that #8217;s my opinion anyway.</TEXT>

I think that is a part of the issue for us. We know that everything passes. Even when we #8217;re hurting there doesn #8217;t seem to be a need to bring more attention to it. It #8217;s as if bringing attention to it gives it power and we (refuse) to do that. So on one side we have Fe not wanting to trouble anyone then on the other side we have Ti and Ni knowing the pattern of things. Knowing this won #8217;t last forever. It #8217;s a normal response for us to think of the future  #8216;always #8217;. As sad as it may ever be we are trouble shooting.. looking for answers and solutions. Focused on the shift we expect. On our own terms. Ti is subjective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually we have the thinking we #8217;re being objective when we #8217;re being subjective. It is logic. It #8217;s based on our insights and what we think. I suppose it #8217;s complicated for someone else to understand. We can be objective ie diplomatic when it comes to others feelings. And obviously we want to learn and grow.. all of us. But when it comes to what someone thinks.. it may be worthy and we may agree.. see the same perspective but ultimately it depends on what we think. Like an INTJ has Fi in the mix. We have Ti.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have some thoughts on that but the point of it is that everyone was protecting themselves. It is survival instinct. The instinct that he had was the opposite of everyone else.. by instinct he would sacrifice himself to keep the materials and debris from hurting people. Rather than chance anyone getting hurt his instinct was rather savior based. The appropriate visual aspect of this was how many did the opposite of what he did. It is a comparative of the MBTI test. Lol. I mean the numbers and in a way the simplification of finding one of us.. throw a grenade. It is sarcasm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes small changes now creates greater change in the future. What I was saying wasn #8217;t literal. It #8217;s an ego base. Not all ego is created by boldness.. some is created by sadness. I know the world has love and I know people love me but really really deep down I feel unlovable. It isn #8217;t them it #8217;s me.  #128521; 2w1</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds worse than it is perhaps but this is a depth that people don #8217;t usually face in life. Basically our darkest secrets, sadness, fear and anger are at the base of ego. It is how we deal with the universal insecurity of feeling that we #8217;re not enough. Some people handle it with sadness, some people with fear some with anger. Development and ego start around the time we start having language. In enneagram 2,3,4 are in the heart center are about love and are based in sadness grief and shame, the sin is pride. 5,6,7 are head center, based in fear, 8,9 and 1 are based in anger. Now because this is a base doesn #8217;t mean these are the expressions.. in fact the expression is often the opposite. So 2s tend to be loving , cheerful, helpful, giving. 2w1 tends to be the helper and 2w3 tends to be the giver. Leo Buscaglia was a 2. I think Gandhi was a 1 not 100% on his wing. Jesus is said to be a 2 although let #8217;s face it.. tough act to follow  #128514;. It #8217;s not as bad as it sounds.. not usually anyway. People don #8217;t like to admit sadness fear and anger but as human beings in life it #8217;s pretty much a part of the package. It is a part of ego.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have a 5 in your life you are special to them. 5w6 and 5w4 have some differences. 5w6 is often better at systems and planning. 5w4 I #8217;m not as familiar with although a good number of my fellow INFJs are 5w4. 5w4 has a wing in a heart center. Is an individualist. Actually has an easier time connecting than 5w6. You treat her with more importance. Perhaps look into your personality types ie Myers Briggs but try not to pay attention to the hype. Look more into the cognitive functions. Use your 5 drive #128527;. But she #8217;s gonna be using her 4 wing and energy. This may be a temporary thing though and this pandemic makes this difficult. She #8217;s probably throwing herself into her work to help her keep her own sanity. I #8217;m sure she cares for you. In life long friendships there are ebbs and flows but if you two can get through this you #8217;ll be close again. Also sharing knowledge is affection for 5s. Is there something new you can learn from her.. maybe something you can do that helps with her Job? Is there any research you can do with her to help her. What she is probably looking for from you is that you are happy for her that she #8217;s growing. What you are probably looking for in her is assurance that she #8217;s not leaving you behind and that you are important to her. I understand you are putting energy into it. She must realize that as well. It would be good if you two could do something that makes you proud of one another. This year has been a time of ungentle change to put it mildly. Keep your chin up. It won #8217;t be like this forever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they #8217;re 5w6 connection is more difficult than it is for a 5w4. Regardless opening up is on their own terms.. what helps is just letting them know you are there. If you know to a degree what the current issue is send information. But this is something they will tend to want to deal with on their own whether it #8217;s what they need or not. Don #8217;t act like it #8217;s troubling you but be tenacious. Sharing knowledge is showing affection for a 5. If they indicate they need you just be there don #8217;t make lite of it and don #8217;t bring attention to it just be there. Because if a 5 does bring it up it is serious. Be there and provide information in a way that can help them have insight. If you #8217;re in a 5s life they are in yours you are already important to them. If they truly open up it #8217;s difficult especially for a 5w6. So depending on their wing is really going to make a difference. A 5w4 will connect perhaps easier yet be more individualistic either way you are going to run into the wall. But how you handle this is going to result in a specific kind of reaction. If you push it is simply harder for them. That in itself makes a 5 withdrawal or want to withdrawal. The reason a 5 is a 5 is because of a need for safety and or they had some intrusion that made them feel unsafe in childhood. Because of this the need for knowledge was particularly and is particularly important because it #8217;s way to prevent this and to protect themselves. There are different kinds of 5s as well as the wings. But the typical reaction is to go inside their minds for safety. It also may just be as simple as needing time to process. And this they need.</TEXT>

When I was younger I thought it was color blindness, then that I had a yellow  #8220;additional cone #8221; because I realized a big difference was the yellow frequency. Now I know it #8217;s something that is related to synesthesia because I #8217;ve come across other synesthetes that have the same thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is re-edited and finished. It will give a little insight now I hope. There are different kinds of 2s. That isn #8217;t my nature at all. 2w1 here. I know there is a loneliness that 2s can feel deeply ( I #8217;m INFJ btw doesn #8217;t help matters lol ) but it #8217;s true connection that #8217;s important. Perhaps the 2 here is very lonely and craves  #8220;connection #8221; period.. perhaps look into personality type as well but don #8217;t pay attention to the hype.. look into cognitive functions. Finding out how he #8217;s wired. You have a right to be bothered by this. It isn #8217;t cool. I haven #8217;t seen specific indication that this is a 2 thing EXCEPT 2s are pleasers and he may be lonely and wanting to fit in where ever he can. When 2s are healthy they go to the high side of 4. Also come to think of it  #129300;.. 2s can have a difficult time with a sense of themselves.. he may be genuine but just doesn #8217;t know. Who wants him and what they want is who he #8217;ll be. 2w3 tend to need validation. Generally 2w1 is the helper, 2w3 is the giver. Yes I think a 2 does try to be everything that their partner wants. He may have been finding out who wants him. A love connection a 2 wants to (merge with that person). Connection is very important for a 2. It sounds like he is a sexual 2. A sexual 2 can tend to do that I think. There is self preservation 2, one on one 2, and social 2. Self preservation you can imagine. Sexual 2 he is an example. I tend to be a social 2 which has to do with more of a world view I suppose. In an intimate relationship which I don #8217;t have lol it would be more one on one. There are different kinds of 2s He #8217;s a sexual 2. Yes he is being manipulative though. He probably doesn #8217;t realize it. Edit: And although there are different 2s. In a close and intimate relationship there is the want for merging. Edit: The feeling of oneness. 2s are about love. Based in sadness and grief. The sin of a 2 is pride: having a hard time admitting their own needs to themselves and to others. The opposite we have as well humility lololol. 2s tend to think others have needs and they themselves do not. 2s want to love and be loved.. as do we all but for a 2 that is what it #8217;s all about. So for myself I feel love when others feel love. Love is within though. I think that there are 2s that realize this but see we are in the heart triad and way down deep feel there is something wrong with us  #128514;. There is in the base of the heart triads ego that feels unlovable. That doesn #8217;t mean that they think they are not loved. The worth of a 2 is about what they can do for others. Helping and giving. A 2 feels they must do this because it is a reason for their life and because it #8217;s a way to show love and a reason someone will love them. Remember a 2 is based in sadness. Telling this particular 2 you are acquainted to what they #8217;ve done.. well keep in mind that the hurt they feel is also a motivation for what they #8217;ve done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seeing this late; sorry. How far back do you want to go? Information I have without looking is that they were seen as a sign and that their coming was a punishment and a marker of illness and famine to come. This makes me think of sacrifice. They kept track of it because they saw a pattern of events. I #8217;m thinking prior to Egypt. I #8217;ll look into Phoenicians within 200 years BC first. Then Rome and Egypt. Do you have a preference? I don #8217;t mind doing the research. Things like this go way beyond this time. Tribes etc. even rainbows were seen as bad omens and were thought to be aliens come to take people away. What people do not understand people find a pattern and correlation to events. When we go into the understanding of Egyptians we have Geography involved.. we have the Tigris and Euphrates, There were many floods. For people to associate the Halley #8217;s Comet with illness and Famine it meant that there were events that seemed to correlate/coincide. This and the fear of not understanding .. meant they wanted to know when it would happen again. This sort of thinking is as old as the existence of humans looking up at the stars and seeing patterns and cycles. So how far back  #128514;?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. The Haley #8217;s comet before that time was about 240 B. C. 75 year cycle.. if I #8217;m remembering this correctly. Phoenicians did animal sacrifices. Remains of animal and human babies were found in jars. Seemed to be mainly boys but there was female DNA as well. It does appear that babies were sacrificed in that scientists weren #8217;t finding disease. There were graveyards with stones in which they were berried. If they were sacrificed they were the children in the jars. Phoenicians made sacrifices to appease their God. People would have seen Haley #8217;s Comet maybe once or twice in a lifetime. Seeing that it didn #8217;t bring something positive about people would connect it to other events or a warning perhaps. Possibly they did sacrifices and then something bad wouldn #8217;t happen so they thought sacrifices worked. Perhaps these were animal sacrifices perhaps that didn #8217;t work. You get the idea. The degree in which it was done is hard to say but regardless the answer was surely( the negative that they would have associated with the comet ) If the sacrifice were animal it may or may not have appeased God in their minds because it depended on the out come. Cause and effect. I personally don #8217;t think it was preferable but they tried to take the outcome into their own hands by making sacrifices. With no reason to associate it with the positive ( think about it visually ) Rome, Egypt would #8217;ve seen it this same way. I mean that it was something to be afraid of. Very afraid of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Collective consciousness isn #8217;t tangible.. what I mean is it isn #8217;t a solid lol. People that have the experience see the difference. It is subjective. And by that I mean within the individual as well as how the information is comprehended. It would have to do with faith. People would not receive proof in a way that they would see value in until the event happened. So here we have Cassandra  #128514;. Things did not go so well for her. Lol. Let me explain further. Vision isn #8217;t handed over. Other people do not experience it. Cassandra is in Greek Mythology. The God Apollo fell in love with her and gave her the gift of prophecy. She didn #8217;t reciprocate and he cursed her having the ability to see the future yet #8221;no one would believe her #8221;. Her gift was a curse as she was thought to be the bearer of bad news. Edit: It #8217;s burn the witch mentality. People don #8217;t believe what they do not see. It would have to do with faith rather than proof.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A problem here in is that there are things that can #8217;t be avoided in fact telling people can make it worse. Telling people can also in some cases cause the event. I #8217;m sure there are many people that would rather be thought of as a nut case if they had the choice to change the outcome. People have free will but fate has momentum. And the nature of humans is that the same problem that created the outcome was the nature of humans to begin with. It requires being further away to change something that has had momentumous fingers stretching far into the past. So there are something #8217;s that will happen and nothing can be done to rectify it because the same reasons it wouldn #8217;t be believed or be a forethought is because of the very nature of human beings that has created the problem in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. Or worse. I could give a clear example but it would cause more problems because of human nature. I could describe the person that would commit an awful crime. If people even listened they would have prejudice to certain people and this could cause more crime. As well as it could promote the idea to people that would take up the same behavior of the original foreseen crime. Panic, hatred and discontent, in a situation intensified with other events that people are already stressed and scared it would even make matters worse.</TEXT>

Even if people realized it within their lifetime they wouldn #8217;t see it. Patterns are the differences not the similarities. Change creates more variables. Variables create more variables.

    <TEXT>INFPs tend to do the exact same thing you #8217;re doing in how you are deciding your type. Also INFPs can take subjects that seem completely unconnected and find connections. The pattern recognition is different. If you have an opinion in the creative concepts you have if deriving at a universal tie that could give me insight in this regard... Do you take unrelated subjects and find a connection.  #8220;A jumping #8221;. If so it sounds more INFP and your enneagram 5 would explain the variant in S and a little in F. If this is a different process than what you do and they are related.. subjects have connections I may be more inclined to say INTJ. You #8217;re temperament could be either.  #128578; Ps sorry for my typos.. that would especially bother an INTJ  #128514;. An INFP it wouldn #8217;t bother to much sooo do typos bother you? Does misspelling and grammatical errors bother you or the facts the focus wether you were interested or not?  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I do this more after developing or while developing Te. I never liked what I considered to be useless or junk information before with my Ti but since developing Te I cringe when I see  #8220;mistakes happening #8221; Much of the time now it isn #8217;t so much wanting to dismiss or wanting to bipass the trivial useless information but not wanting to see mistakes whatsoever. It sounds like you zone in and out ie Ni but then you use Te. That sounds INTJ because the search is directed. Do you complete your findings before you share them? Although that is something typical to a 5. I was thinking you could be INFP with a 5 but after hearing this process I think it sounds more (INTJ) definitely Intuitive and Te. Try the test with what you consider  #8220;consistent #8221; to compare the comparatives and go from there. Ni with Ti like me tends to eliminate the useless information. Then focus on the big picture. Te with Ni grabs more information until it makes sense. I #8217;ve always loved research but now it #8217;s quite different the research is verifying insight still but I can be in a trail and the doing research has the answers as well as the research itself. It #8217;s as if the search has the information organized of what I want to express. It is Ni and Ne as well. It is Ti and Te as well. In my cognitive functions stack my Thinking and feeling has the same sum. My stacks are Ni Fe Ti Se Ne Te Fi Si. The Te and Fi are flipped but the difference was only 1 point.  #128518;. In the primary cognitive functions my Fe is over my Ti by one point. You see they fit into an equal sum. Lol. Probably just INFJ humor but I find it funny  #128566;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand. You did great. There #8217;s a Sakinorva cognitive functions test and if you do or have done that test you can pay more attention to the cognitive functions rather than MBTI. No one has to fit in a box. Make your own judgements and observe your use of your own cognitive functions. You learn and develop them at your own pace. When you are familiar you can see the times you are having different processes at work and when you are looping. Also knowing what processes you #8217;re having involved when you #8217;re looping will help. Basically use MBTI for vocabulary you assign the words to their meanings. Make your own legend. Use our own meanings. So you experience.. you assign your own understanding.  #128522;. Never let MBTI pigeonhole you or prevent you from growing or understanding others. People aren #8217;t so separate. We have more in common than we realize. Learn and grow at your own pace.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. Sorry just seeing this. You are not wrong. The thing is the more we are oblivious of ego and less emerged from our soul the harder it may be for those get through and let go. Those who do evil have more to go through. Some people suffer. Some people get stuck in other dimensions. People who can #8217;t let go can #8217;t get in. But as souls we are love and light. We will all get there because we were once there. Time isn #8217;t linear. When we die our internal clock dies and we experience time more as time is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course. Are souls are good. As souls as one were perfect. In life all of us are flawed and imperfect.  #128522; I #8217;m not saying we are bad lol. What I #8217;m saying is we all have light and we all have dark. The kindest people on earth still have ego. We can purge our egos. When doing this we gain humility. But it isn #8217;t a destination and done. We all have work to do. We are on a journey.  #10084; #65039; #12336; #65039; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. You are correct. We can #8217;t stay in the light or continuously clear the path. Everything must pass. Also I believe you and understand where you #8217;re coming from. No one perspective is right or wrong. All perspectives unified is more accurate. But no one person is right and all others wrong. I like talking with you. You #8217;re on the right track.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve listened to Alan Watts but there #8217;s a problem for me. The here and now I understand the quest but human beings living in the moment causes havoc in the future. To evolve people will need to be further reaching in thought, less concentric thinking and have compassion beyond their own perimeters. In every facet of existence Love is very important. So if you have that down that #8217;s fine with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t go by what you hear by man. Man has distorted what it means to follow Christ. Christianity and following Christ are very different things. Also Jesus wasn #8217;t religious he was spiritual. Probably closer to your own personal beliefs than to Christianity. He would have a few things to say about a religion after his name causing separation between God and People. God isn #8217;t found in a building or a book but within. Christianity is misused so much. The oneness you have in Taoism is closer to Christ #8217;s own beliefs. We are one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Formative years were good. I primarily interacted with adults though and had a friend I would see occasionally that was the daughter of one of my Dads band members. I suppose that having adults around influenced my cognitive processes. But I don #8217;t think these were the main contributors. I #8217;d say that the travels and people I interacted with gave me material to work with in the future but my cognitive processes were pretty set. I felt more accepted in the travels and places we went. I do think that it has contributed to how I connect to friendships. Quality more than quantity. How I connect with nature and animals. Also I never grew out of the why stage I suppose. First 4 years of my life I spent traveling all over the US in a couple of VW vans either with my family or with my Dads band. Sometimes we would stay in hotels where the band was playing, sometimes we #8217;d stay at a farm, sometimes in the woods. But usually we were traveling and the only time my feet would touch the earth was to go to an art museum, hear my Dads band in practice and live performances and visit family on the road. There are pictures of me alone and doing art. The formative years were pretty wonderful. I was learning a lot, having wonderful experiences, exposed to all sorts of art and cultures, and had lots of love around me. The lead singers always surrogated lol. Things changed when my family settled down so I could go to school. It wasn #8217;t an easy transition. I had been primarily around adults 24/7.. I was a little adult. I remember 1 kid.. She was a daughter of a band member. She was older. She was my friend  #128578;. The first year we settled down I was given a choice of going to school or being with my family. I skipped kindergarten. I spent time playing alone but it was like I wasn #8217;t alone haha. I spent time thinking and doing artwork. I had trauma as well.. but my formative years were really good IMO. It wasn #8217;t until we settled down that things took a turn for the worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Twins are rarely ready to join. There are many reasons for this. One of these reasons is that we grow at different stages and different times. The gravitational thing does sound like twin flames but the connection doesn #8217;t center around the physical. Twin flames can be different ages.. same sex.. different sexual orientations.. different geological locations etc. the purpose for uniting isn #8217;t physical but transformative. Generally just a run in with your twin will spark growth and transformative processes. There are some twins that unite in the physical and have romantic bonds but these twins know that that isn #8217;t what it #8217;s about. The purpose for twins to separate and rejoin is to learn and grow... to evolve and join to help the evolution of our species. The purpose for twins is to grow and give this vibration to others. It is rare for twins to join. But the gravitation is like nothing else lol. If he is your twin.. neither of you are ready. And it #8217;s ok. When twins are ready not even death separates them. Twins ready and joining are rare. Twins mirror the best and the worst of each other.</TEXT>

It is a result of their actions and the horror associated with this period of history.. the meaning was different than it is since. The symbolisms origin can be seen all over Ancient Rome.
