    <TEXT>Hey, sorry yes should have detailed. Im taking co-codomol 30/500 (30 co cod/500 paracetamol)which I should be taking at a dose of 2 three times daily. However as I #8217;ve said I #8217;m taking more than I should be. When I run out of my prescription, I #8217;ll source what I can. Which could be more 30/500, tramadol in any strength, or shop bought neurofen plus (because of its high opioid content) or over the counter co codomol I have chronic back pain, which is well controlled by the medication I have (it #8217;s what the co codomol is actually for) I noticed one time that I got a high off it and I liked it. And before I knew it I was  #8220;there #8221; I #8217;m just taking them as pills but I am worried about the amount of paracetamol I #8217;m ingesting obviously that will be a high dose.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Paracetamol toxicity and codomol</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-04 08:05:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I posted here before worried about addiction to co-codomol (don #8217;t know what the American version is, I #8217;m in the uk) and about possible toxic levels of paracetamol (co-cod is 30mg Codeine/500mg para). Someone mentioned that the dose is 7g a day top end, and anything over was overdose. I hadn #8217;t looked all that much into it to be honest, probably out of fear. What I did do was swap out my prescription co cod for a generic shop bought version that contains ibuprofen and a lower dose of Codeine instead. The point of this narrative is: I feel 100% better. I am still in the grip of Codeine, but can use these shop bought chaps to reduce. I don #8217;t feel as muggy, irritable or sleepy etc as I did which are all symptoms of paracetamol overdose/toxicity. I must have been slowly destroying my liver. Hopefully I #8217;ve caught it and this has been a boot to the arse I #8217;ve needed to control myself. Thanks to the guy who mentioned it btw you may have saved me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you my friend, I didn #8217;t know that was a thing it #8217;s interesting. However I #8217;m planning to ditch the codeine altogether. I just can #8217;t believe the difference I feel in myself and what I thought was Codeine withdrawal was in fact paracetamol toxicity. I #8217;m taking a much lower dose of Codeine/ibuprofen than I was Codeine/paracetamol. I was taking up to twenty 30/500mg co codomol and am now taking four to six neurofen plus which are 12.8mg Codeine/200mg ibuprofen. The safe dose stated on the box is 6 tablets in 24hours so I am at least proud of me staying within the guidelines lol.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-17 08:24:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I need help financially managing myself. I #8217;m terrible. I get it in one hand and I actually invent ways to spend it until it #8217;s gone. Subsequently I #8217;m in debt, not badly but I #8217;m getting there. I #8217;ve never been able to budget, and my money management is beyond poor. Is there any sort of courses or anything like that to train people who should know better how to manage their finances, budget and also not spend their money on absolute nonsense? I #8217;m pushing 40 I really should be able to do this by now. But every time I get low mood (I #8217;m BPD) Etsy, eBay and Amazon come out to play. I think I need someone to take my money away every month and give me pocket money or something</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;d like to buy a machine to make sticker sheets, mainly for myself. My mum has a cameo, but seems reluctant to learn how to use it, and also won #8217;t part with it. So I thought I #8217;d buy my own. But I really only want to make stickers and sticker sheets and that kind of thing. So what would I be best looking at?

    <TEXT>I have a MacBook Air 2017 and an iPad Pro 2018. I edit photos on the Mac. I've noticed though that the pictures look hazy and soft and a little fuzzy like they're slightly out of focus when I have them loaded on photoshop on the MacBook. But when I transfer the image to the iPad it looks sharp. So the question I have is why? How come the images look soft and what not while on the Mac but the exact same file looks great on the iPad? Could this be a settings issue? Both devices are up to date with software etc.</TEXT>

I downloaded some software from seagate, that also sees it but shows it as having no partition. I have no clue what #8217;s going on, but there are files on there I need to get access to. Does anyone have any idea what I can do?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-27 23:31:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Female (38) 5ft 6" Non smoker/drinker 11stone 8lb (ish) UK (Scotland -NHS) Chronic depression, cPTSD, BPD, anxiety (non dental related) My teeth are vile. Haven't taken care of them for various reasons I don't want to go into. Ideally I'd like them all pulled but every dentist I go to (U.K) refuses, stating I "don't know what I'm asking for" I know they hurt, I know I won't look after them when I relapse and I know fixing them will cost more in the long run in terms of cost and health. How can I persuade a dentist to at least look at my train of thought? Can I not just ask to pay to have them out? Like I would actually pay almost anything at this point. I understand that the dentists have my best interests as they see it at heart, but if a person can have plastic surgery why can't I pay to have my teeth out? I'm in near constant pain at this point and am refusing antibiotics for the recurring infections because they do next to nothing anyway now. If I end up with blood poisoning will they take them out then? If it didn't hurt so much I'd do it myself!</TEXT>

I feel like utter shit when I don't have them. I'm not "getting anything" from them, except the pain relief but I know enough to know that could be in my head now. what can I do, I've been taking them for about 5 years, and can take up to 12 tablets a day, more when I can. I realise I can't continue, I have none left after today anyway so taper isn't a thing I can do (no willpower anyway) so I guess I'm about to be sick for a while. How can I make it less shitty for myself? I'll have to still function and work through this (can't take sick days I'm self employed) ETA I can access methadone but I feel that's dramatic</TEXT>

I #8217;m hoping once they #8217;ve fulfilled the preorders they #8217;ll allow a trade in for those who want it, or offer loops as your next pair instead of headphones. I would be very tempted to buy a pair of these right enough, and outright. I prefer in ear to over ear so these would definitely suit me better. Plus you can nap with them in!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Teeth extraction advise IK</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-08 11:28:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I cannot get any dentist near me to extract my teeth. They are horrendous. Constant infections, falling apart, cavities and so on. I don #8217;t take care of them when I #8217;m not well, when I am well I want rid of them because I know I won #8217;t take care of them when I #8217;m not well. Every dentist I #8217;ve been to near me (uk) just wants to save them. I get it, it probably is the best option as they see it. However I am in constant pain, constantly infected. We have free(ish) dental care on NHS and I have even offered to source the money to pay for the full thing privately. But I apparently don #8217;t know what I #8217;m talking about. I #8217;m told you can #8217;t eat or taste properly with dentures. Well I can barely eat as it is so where #8217;s the difference? Chronic sinitus leaves a minuscule sense of taste as well. One dentist said, I #8217;ll do a root canal and tidy them up then if you just don #8217;t take in any sugar, when you #8217;re not well your teeth will be fine. No I want them gone. Please for the love of anything holy what do I need to do. What can I do to make them hear me. Because I feel dismissed any time I try and discuss this. I also have a paranoid fear of dentists, not dentists specifically but of the severe nervy tooth pain you get when you #8217;ve not been numbed properly. And the noises. My diet is almost totally liquid at this point. I don #8217;t drink I don #8217;t smoke but I am ingesting silly amounts of painkillers to allow me to function through the pain. I #8217;m 38 (F).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a shower thought, forgive me for being potentially very dense. Our refs can be a bit...iffy at times. Accusations from all sides about prejudices and etc. What if we hired ref #8217;s from other countries, specifically England and Wales cos they #8217;re closer, to ref the bigger games. Such as old firm, cup finals and the like. The rules of the game are the same across the board and if a ref comes in from say, Spain, surely they can #8217;t be accused of being  #8220;a Tim #8221; or  #8220;a hun #8221; or whatever. I realise the costs may be prohibitive, but maybe the bigger clubs could chip in? Or could we employ a foreign ref to review games of this nature or to be that fourth official? Shower thoughts is all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Heat shield query</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-21 13:15:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a 2013 Toyota Yaris hybrid. (UK) There was a rattle from under that I eventually traced to a heat shield for the exhaust. Not having the equipment to safely lift the car and effect a mcgyver repair I just helped it to fall off instead. So the query is, will my car catch fire now, will something melt. Do I need to seek the help of a pro to put a new one on? Or can it live without it? The shield was at a part of the exhaust that didn #8217;t appear to be near anything, but knowing cars there may be something I can #8217;t see that #8217;s now being boiled. Cheers folks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;m coming off a chronic codeine addiction, decided to wean off using otc meds instead of cold turkey. For the most part it #8217;s going well. Instead of 6-8 30mg codine today I #8217;ve had 4 12.8mg otc stuff. But as the night is drawing on I #8217;m starting to feel it a lot, like my head says just take another 4, fuck it. I feel unwell anyway, I think I have a bug so I #8217;m kinda using that to mask the withdrawals. But knowing I can take these to just feel better is playing on my head. This is where willpower comes in I know. Hopefully I #8217;ll sleep tonight and it #8217;ll be better in the morning.</TEXT>

It wasn #8217;t sore, but obviously needing attended. He gave me antibiotics and I #8217;ve to see him again on Thursday. The problem is this; the antibiotics are working because it has shrunk a little, but now it hurts. A lot. Ibuprofen not touching it and my sinus is starting to ache as well. What #8217;s going on? Why would it suddenly hurt when it #8217;s getting smaller? Should I phone in about this or hang off til Thursday? I also feel generally unwell and have a horrid taste (didn #8217;t before)but I #8217;m putting that down to the antibiotics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve posted recently about the dentures I #8217;ve been given and have had sound advice. I seem to be healing ok atm thank god, I #8217;d forgotten how sore extractions can leave you though... Anyway, I #8217;m supposed to wear these dentures more or less 24/7, but I noticed they #8217;re rubbing badly (and painfully) where the gum is still swollen. It #8217;s also where I have stitches. There #8217;s a wee white patch forming where they #8217;re making the worst of the contact. Would I be better just not wearing them for the time being, and allowing everything to heal first? I #8217;m not bothered about being  #8220;gumsy #8221; self isolation will take care of that issue!</TEXT>

I tend not to make friends because I feel they all leave in the end, and I get paranoid about people in a work environment not liking me or hating me but that #8217;s it. I have almost all the other signs though, except self harm/suicidal ideation</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m on the self employment thing with UC (name escapes me right now) and I #8217;m due to file my self assessment with HMRC. Wouldn #8217;t be a problem if I hadn #8217;t lost my records like a twat. So obviously I can #8217;t remember exactly what earnings I #8217;ve had, deductions are fine because I have receipts. Mileage is another one. I guess the question is, will HMRC tell dwp what I #8217;ve written, and if it is different (I expect it to be) how much trouble am I in? I #8217;ve already written in my journal asking if I can see what I put for each month, but obviously it #8217;ll take a while to get back to me with the covid crisis. I #8217;ve never filed a tax thing before, and I #8217;m certain I #8217;m going to screw this up Any help at all is appreciated even if it #8217;s to tell me I #8217;ll be sanctioned and sent to gulag</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had the same kind of issue, although I live in the uk and our dental care is largely free. However I still battled for years to just have the damn things removed. No one would do it. I had constant toothache, gum ache, face ache and sinitus. Eventually I found a dentist who agreed it was time to loose the pests, as I had so many abscesses along my top teeth they had more or less joined up into a super abscess. Anyway, teeth out, couple of months into recovery and I #8217;ve never been happier. Honest to god it #8217;s the best thing I #8217;ve ever done for my health. Like you I couldn #8217;t smile or even really talk to people because of the state of the inside of my face. But now, I can. I only have temporary dentures atm (thanks corona) but eventually I #8217;ll have proper dentures that look like decent real teeth. So the point of this story is this: maybe you should work towards affording a total removal? Might be better for you (and possibly cheaper) in the long run. I realise this doesn #8217;t help you get funded for anything but it might give you a plan to target for instead maybe. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do you manage your head during withdrawal? I can just about handle the physical stuff, I #8217;m coping ok with that. I #8217;m reducing not cold turkey because I know ct can be dangerous especially with tramadol. My head won #8217;t leave me alone. And it #8217;s not even the urge to take, I #8217;m really not even bothered about ever taking them again. My thoughts are... chaotic. It #8217;s like the worse end my depressive state can be, but without so much of the actual low mood. It #8217;s weird, I can #8217;t articulate it properly. I think if I could just shush my thoughts for a bit I #8217;d actually have a chance at this. I #8217;ve been taking tramadol for years, 200mg tabs at least 5/6 a day. I #8217;ve got down to 2 200mgs yesterday and so far only 200mgs today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I #8217;m doing better today thank the gods. I found that jumping to nurofen plus (12.5codiene) has helped a touch with the physical stuff, I #8217;m not taking anymore after today to avoid dependence there as well. I basically threw myself into walking, reading, lying in a scalding bath and so on which has somehow helped a little. My mind isn #8217;t as noisy today. I think not having any sort of easy access to trams this time has helped in a way. It #8217;s kinda forced my hand so to speak. So the next big step is to stay where I am now, at as little as possible until my supply actually does run out and then *not* seek more. Happily they #8217;re becoming difficult to get here it seems. Apart from the noisy head and achy bits, I #8217;m feeling a lot better. I #8217;m on Prozac for depression already so I suppose that #8217;ll be helping as well I don #8217;t doubt you #8217;ll eventually find the end to this for yourself too :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So glad I found here. Currently only internet diagnosed because my dr only takes emergency appt atm, and this isn #8217;t... It #8217;s on my feet and by the gods do I want to just sever them. I can #8217;t stand this and am not sure what to try. The one thing that seems to give relief is soaking my feet in a bath of water as hot as I can stand it. But that #8217;s not a long term solution I know. I guess I #8217;m looking for advice on managing symptoms til I get a real diagnosis and I also want to be informed when I eventually get to the dr again. It comes and goes, is that normal? Like I can go months and it #8217;s fine and then suddenly..... ITCH What else can I try?</TEXT>
