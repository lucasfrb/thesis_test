    <TITLE>Jamo S807 floor standing speakers - am i doing a mistake?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-05 05:13:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone. Because of lack of the reviews, I would like to try asking here. I would appreciate any tips from you PRO's. :\) Should I buy this pair of floor standing speakers \([Jamo S807](http://www.jamo.com/products/s-807)\)? If is there anyone who had a chance to hear them, are they absolutely terrible sounding or not? I must confess that the design got me caught up. But after considering spending apx. 900USD on a system\(with a AMP or 2chan. recevier\), I would like to know I am not doing a mistake there. Is there a significantly better sounding set of a speakers I should know about? Off\-topic: Would be getting a stereo receiver \([YAMAHA R\-S202D](https://europe.yamaha.com/en/products/audio_visual/hifi_components/r-s202d/index.html) for example\) such a sin instead of AMP\([YAMAHA A\-S201](https://europe.yamaha.com/en/products/audio_visual/hifi_components/a-s201/index.html)\) in this price range \+ considered speakers used or is this not in my concern? Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would actually want to elaborate here: Sure, for let's say 1500USD I could get a PC made of the cheapest possible parts, that in a certain game would make 200FPS. Loud, overheating. Or I could pick better quality parts, maybe even prettier (subjectively) and the game would run at 175FPS but I would have a nice, quiet system that I enjoy having. And isn't it the purpose of why we do all this? To have a good feeling about having "nice things" Heck, all life is about being happy, and if buying a more expensive GPU makes me happy I'm all in brother. Also, my GF left me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, so I took my time to get familiar with them and they are really, really comfy - given the gargantuan size. About the sound - I can not borrow these to a friend who does not listen to music this way and expect any sort of excitement. They are flat with a fading bass. But be sure that this is exactly what I wanted. They are very precise and I will be happy to use them for gaming and listening to music, too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I've just replied above. For short listening I will prefer my IEMs, for music. They are brighter and have more bass. However I cannot listen to them for too long. So these, as definitely flatter ones, are the way for longer sessions! (Also, I hate how long it takes to put in IEMs, put the cable around the ear and so on :D)</TEXT>
