    <TEXT>I finally decided to join the discussion here to give some insight. As some of you might know the plus version of the UP is pretty much all about restaurations, but as we know little of what Troika planned sometimes we have to make stuff up. As for the Malkavian Maze, we found screenshots of the area that showed that it was cut and rebuild them as closely as possible! These areas are at the beginning and the end and we needed something to make the middle interesting. Then I found the broken dome with the hole, a daylight skybox and a concept painting which pretty much looked like the room looks now so I build it in that way. You can find the screenshots and concept art in the patch extras folder restauration document! I figured if Grout is able to keep his wife in some kind of stasis and give claws to his ghouls, he might find a way to simulate daylight as well. As for Kent, this came indeed later as a kind of easter egg, but as Grout was doing experiments to learn more about his "condition", why not use another vampire for this as well?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See above for my intention behind the room and the license. As for Grout, in my opinion he is dead and everything else is illogical!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe my above comment was a bit harsh, but most people supporting the "Grout is alive idea" ignore that a) he would never have left his wife behind to die in the fire and b) Ming Xiao must have been really stupid and she is the leader of the Kuij-Yin...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was completely surprised by the sisters' revelation, but then I was coming from FPSs to Bloodlines where things like this rarely happen. And I too have the impression that the movie Harley Quinn looks very much like Jeanette! Back on topic, the Ocean House is a famous map not only because of it's design, but also because of the intention. Like here you are, powerful force of the night, and suddenly you die because of something you can't even fight!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was done to reflect their actual dialogues. In the Last Round Skelter says you should go up and meet Nines, which makes no sense when he is upstairs himself. And Fat Larry claims the is the "man in the alley" and he "saw you coming down the street", all of which he couldn't do in the old position. Besides that he would be selling illegal stuff right in front of a guard and he was shown to be in the alley near Club Confession in the beta too.

    <TEXT>I don't believe that. The alley where Larry waits in the plus patch is the number one shortcut through the downtown map and he is visible from Club Confession, Skyeline Appartments and the Empire Hotel. On the other hand in the old place you would only see him when you explored everything! I have another theory on this though: In the new place Larry can be killed by the gang members fighting and I had to work quite a bit to keep that possibility low. As for Damsel and Skelter, if you didn't notice Damsel up there, you wouldn't have noticed Skelter either, so the change doesn't matter...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with most of the answers here except I believe: 2. Like he said in the game Beckett did some more research and learned that the sarcophagus could contain either Messerach or Lamastu, so as both were no Antediluvians something was off and somebody had spread that rumour on purpose. I don't think he knew more than that! 4. In my opinion Nines didn't know anything specific about the sarcophagus either, but I'm sure Jack told him to ignore it and not get the Anarchs caught in the fighting over it. Notice that Nines never mentions the sarcophagus and Damsel and Skelter don't really care as well! 8. My theory is that the whole thing was a test from Caine to see how his childer would react to the promise of endless power in form of the sarcophagus and rising power in form of the player character experiencing it himself. Which probably threw a bad light on vampires ;)!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, there is some stuff in the plus patch that is more about personal taste ;). As for Bertram's quest, I played as a Toreador and ended up with a CD item I had no use for which puzzled me a lot! So I fixed that. Also a lot of these restoration have aspects that we needed to improvise as we didn't really know how e.g. the library map would have looked if Troika had done it or how the drug quest would have played out. Therefore I moved all of this in the optional plus patch! Maybe I should create a video about the differences and whatever is behind them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what Boyarsky said in an interview with RPGCodex in 2004: "What features would you have like to have included in Bloodlines, if money, time and manpower wasn't an issue? I think that if you asked any developer that question, they'd say they'd like to implement every last detail that they originally envisioned for the game, but was just not feasible due to money/time constraints. For us specifically, we would have loved to have given the player the opportunity to play one of the independent clans, or even go over to the sabbat side, but that would have necessitated making at least three different games in one. And don't get me started on Diablerie..." I believe they didn't work concretely on this because of the reason he mentioned. But I don't think it was an accident that one endgame story state was unused, as if they reserved it for a possible expansion. So I improvised a Sabbat ending and burgermeister added a whole Sabbat questline...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely disagree. There is no proof at all that Beckett is in on this with Jack! Beckett is a known loner who has no connections to the Anarchs, so why should Jack trust him? I'm pretty sure Jack told Nines and the Anarchs not to care about the sarcophagus, and they don't among all factions in Bloodlines, but in my opinion Beckett did some research himself and figured out that something was wrong. And he warns the player because like Rosa said, he and Mercurio are the only people the player can trust. Strauss is just too carefull to open the sarcophagus and Andrei sinks it into the ocean because this is what the Sabbat would do with a powerfull elder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You shouldn't forget that the whole "Kuei-Jin trying to take over LA" plot is based on the PnP game, so Troika just ran with that. This is also valid for the behaviour of Nines and Skelter which has to do with the Anarch movement and not their races. Yukie is an obvious parody of Hentai girls and the author of that article actually forgot to mention the black drug dealer Dennis at the beachhouse, so I would guess she wrote it all because she suffers from racism herself and projected it onto the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Regarding the voice-acting, I know that burgermeister, the creator of the CQM mod, paid professionals for some of the main roles! This might explain differences in quality, because I would guess others were voiced by friends of his. Also while I liked the Sabbat storyline and the new hub in general, I really disliked the LaCroix Domination event for which there was no indication and the stupid combat against the Anarchs, especially the one in the boring dark arena. To me it's obvious that Jack told them about his plan and they would never fight for the sacrophagus. They basically ignore it in the original game which should be hint enough!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Indeed I removed the "anarch" from that line in the UP because subtitles did not match the spoken words. Also why should LaCroix call your sire an "a loyal and upstanding member of our organization" if he was Anarch? This wouldn't make sense, so in my opinion Troika cut this in the voice-over and just forgot to fix the subtitles... As for the sire and his strange behaviour, we will try to explain that in the Prelude mod :)!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting. I for one didn't like the sudden Domination of LaCroix and the multiple fights against the Anarchs, one of them even in the chantry. For the Domination there was no hint although you always got particle effects when LaCroix did it in the original game and as I explained elsewhere I strongly believe that Jack told the Anarchs what was in the sarcophagus and that they shouldn't bother with it which they do in the original game. Also if you think it would be difficult to kill a Nosferatu primogen in his lair, I bet it would be impossible to kill Strauss in the chantry, he could just never let you reach him using his teleports! And the ugly dark fighting arena there was much below all other maps in matter of quality. Were the voice-overs for Nines and others still missing when you played it? And what do you think the Sabbat would have done to an Antediluvian? In the UP Sabbat ending I made Andrei lower the sarcophagus into the sea, but more or less only because I had to use the existing ending scenes.</TEXT>

Also I can imagine him killing some kine for a big plan like this. Which wasn't his in the first place, as he says to the Cabbie in the end: "Hey, it happened just like you said. They never even knew what hit 'em."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;If you mean where it's revealed you were a sleeper, I'd forgotten about that. I meant that, yes. It's not only the Domination without particles, but also that the mod just teleports you to him. Honestly while beta testing the mod, I first thought this was a bug! It would have been better if e.g. you were forced to walk there.  gt;Since you still attack the Kue-Jin and take the key if you side with the Anarchs... ... which still is in the main interest of them and Jack, so why should they stop you? I would only think that Jack would prevent his friends Damsel, Nines and Skelter from getting killed for this hoax.  gt;If you mean the endgame battles, yes. Ah, that's a shame. I told burgermeister if he couldn't get voices there, he better remove the whole black arena fight altogether, but he didn't listen. He loves to kill main NPCs off, I'll guess ;)!  gt;There's a Sabbat ending in UOP? Yes, if you are low humanity when you meet Andrei the first time you can talk with him about joining the Sabbat. You can then latter skip the whole Hallowbrook fight and will get a new ending which is a mix of the Camarilla and Kueij-Yin cutscenes...</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If you don't know what's in it, you might conceivably open it for any reason ranging from curiosity to ambition (which isn't incompatible with Anarchs). Most of the time you can't because you don't have the key and once you have it, you can open it only in LaCroix's presence. So yes, the Anarchs would sacrifice you!  gt; I think it's to give full resolution to the major characters on that route. Like I said, burgermeister likes to kill major characters off for no special reason ;)!  gt; I suspect because it's so simple to keep Humanity up and there aren't any bonuses for low Humanity (and not frenzy-ing is important and free choice of dialogue enjoyable), that tends not to get encountered and mentioned by most players using Plus. Maybe I should remove the Humanity condition but it's only at lower than 5...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but Bloodlines is clearly more unfinished than most games because of the known development problems. So if you would want to only restore stuff exactly the way it would have been intended, no restoration projects could exist at all, as even the developers sometimes don't remember! Like I asked Brian Mitsoda about the library quest and used all the info he gave me. Therefore you have the choice between basic and plus.
