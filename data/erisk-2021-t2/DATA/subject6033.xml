    <TEXT>I like her, she is very committed to the party and knows what she is doing. At least gives the impression that she does, which honestly is half the battle. The problem she has is there is defiantly an uphill battle to win back voters and although she maybe qualified; perceptions of the party may not change over night but I am sure she will be a good leader with the work she has already done for the party but will not swoon vast amounts of voters due to her charismatic charm like say Napoleon would have.</TEXT>

I was just given this tin http://www.lakeland.co.uk/72216/Lakeland-Italian-Espresso-Beans (was using an old peanuts tin before, kind of the same just smaller) Is there anywhere to buy an airtight lid for that? Or is the lid it comes with suitable? (the current lid is just plastic) Or is this even really that big of a deal and maybe just shouldn't bother? Many Thanks in Advance</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cheap VS Expensive Compass</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-04 12:50:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Part of a youth group, was asked to buy a silva compass that has several features , for all members https://www.amazon.co.uk/Silva-35692-1011-Compass-Expedition-4-360/dp/B000KMFR6A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 amp;qid=1517748379 amp;sr=8-1 amp;keywords=silva+compass looks like that but there are others that are cheaper and have the same features. and in total would cost less than  #163;100 in total. The guy was obviously really into this sort of stuff but the youth group are only getting a couple of lessons from him and doing a walk. There are cheaper ones around  #163;8 or even  #163;2 that look the exact same and I don't see how they could actually be that much different to justify such a huge price difference.

Do they have a legal right to do so?  #8203; I have looked up some information but haven't found a specific answer, only that much of the power rests -since 80's- with the Company and the body instrumented to enact labour laws is underfunded.  #8203; If anyone could answer or provide a source I would be grateful.
