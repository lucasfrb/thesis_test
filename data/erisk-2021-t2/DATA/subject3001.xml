    <TEXT>"At the high end of estimated lives saved is the difference between the projected deaths from the study of Professors Ferguson #8217;s group at Imperial assuming no change in behaviour (500,000) less an estimate of excess UK deaths (approximately 60,000 by June 2020). [The] number is likely to be a significant overestimate of likely lives saved. As noted above it does not account for changes in behaviour that would have occurred without the government lockdown; it does not count future higher deaths from side effects of the lockdown (extra cancer deaths for example); and it does not allow for the fact that some of those  #8220;saved #8221; deaths may just have been postponed because when restrictions are eased, and in the absence of a vaccine or of widespread immunity, deaths may pick up again. (If the epidemic is dying out anyway those deaths will not come as the lockdown is eased but in this case the 440,000 saved lives is also excessive because the lockdown may have come as a decline in infections was happening for other reasons)." What a suprise, we were all right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Beware of the 'Covid long-haulers'</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-02 02:30:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Read r/COVID19positive and you will see many stories of people having had coronavirus symptoms for months and warning people to take the virus seriously, lockdown forever etc. While post-viral fatigue is obviously a factor in many of these cases, this is not massively uncommon with influenza or a cold and certainly not a justification for a lockdown. Now listen to this definition, does this sound familiar (especially to reddit and twitter doomers)? "The person may be reacting to normal bodily sensations or a minor illness. He or she may have a strong tendency to worry about illness or feel more threatened than average by health concerns. But the person is not "faking." The symptoms cause authentic distress." This is the Harvard definition of Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD), a increasing common mental disorder which can be caused, by amongst other things, anxiety and stress. Considering that the governments exaggerated the seriousness of the virus to encourage obedience to lockdown measures, I would not be surprised to see that many of the these 'long-term' anecdotes are SSD induced by anxiety and stress. In fact, you may be surprised to know that a study has already shown that "When adjusted for all other covariates, the highest quintile of COVID #8208;19 anxiety remained significantly and strongly associated with all somatic symptoms" (COVID-19-related anxiety predicts somatic symptoms in the UK population- https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12430). Meaning that "it suggests that the anxiety that people are experiencing because of this pandemic is a unique contributor to the somatic problems that they are suffering from. There is, therefore, potential for additional strain on health service providers if individuals seek help for these complaints." I see examples of this occuring in the media also such as this article: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/26/im-a-covid-19-long-hauler-im-still-dealing-with-pain-fatigue-and-misery Far from me to prescribe someone as having a mental disorder from the paper but read this paragraph that is contained within the article: "Thankfully, this low point of incapacitation has eased a little. Certain things are helping; a nutrition and supplement regime, acupuncture (good but expensive) and total rest (free but not good for the self-employed). As I move from bed to sofa and back again, I learn that Gwyneth Paltrow has designed a new  #163;58 candle that smells like her orgasm. If I had the energy I would do the same but I #8217;m not sure it would sell; my Covid candle has top notes of gluten-free oatcakes, middle notes of humid sheets and a base note of despair". How The Guardian has allowed this to be published is beyond me, no sign of a positive test, alternative medicine and 'nutrients and supplements' should have ensured it shouldn't have been inside a tabloid, let alone The Guardian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"This is deeply irresponsible"??? Mate, this is a PHE study. Yes, nothing is a certainty, but this whole process has been a series of educated guesses due to the lack of quality research on topics(Spreading mechanisms, Masks, Lockdown, Effectiveness of certain mitigation measures etc.) Remember the whole, 'any mask is better than no mask; make your own', narrative. Well despite the 'common sense' or it being a 'no-brainer', a study published two days ago suggested that they could potentially do more harm than good("We noticed that speaking through some masks (particularly the neck fleece) seemed to disperse the largest droplets into a multitude of smaller droplets, which explains the apparent increase in droplet count relative to no mask in that case." https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/07/sciadv.abd3083) Just because you disagree with the outcome of a study doesn't make it "deeply irresponsible". Remember we are following the science, not just the science that agrees with your perception.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fantastic quote from the article, really sums up lockdown as a whole for me: "Politicians crave visible interventions that show they are taking action (Strong, 1990); uncertainty is easily glossed over as evidence makes the leap from academia to the world of policy. Public health cannot wait for unequivocal evidence, and decisions must be made on imperfect knowledge, and informed by values as well as evidence. However, the speed with which an open scientific question is converted into an unequivocal scientific message and thence a blunt policy intervention with important potential unintended consequences means that  #8211; ironically  #8211; the opportunity for enacting post-normal science is squandered in just the kind of situation where it seems most warranted.  #8216;Simple messages #8217; are prioritised over  #8216;communicating uncertainty #8217;; responsiveness is prioritised over  #8216;time-consuming quality assessment #8217; and  #8216;consensus building processes between plural perspectives #8217; (Sarkki et al., 2014, pp. 199 #8211;200). The debate becomes polarised and binary: if the science says yes to face coverings, then challenging the orthodoxy or even questioning its universality becomes heretical. The potential harms from unconditional advocacy that fails to engage the extended peer community and the wider public, moreover, go beyond the downsides of the implementation of one policy. They include the erosion of trust in science as a field in general, when the measures put forward fail to live up to their promise, or result in problems that could be, or had been, anticipated."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes ofc they are different viruses, don't be disingenuous, you know that is what I meant, I was asking how they were functionally different? R0: Simular if a bit higher. IFR: ~0.5% Simular to 1957 H2N2 Pandemic. Age Stratification: Only really a danger to the  gt;65 compared to influenza which is dangerous also to the young. Long-term effects: Unclear at this stage but seems reasonably similar to influenza. Drugs: Steroids for C19, not much for flu (Tamiflu 'best'). Seasonality: Based on other HCov's, highly seasonal like the flu. You may be interested to know that there is emerging evidence that the 1889 'Russian flu' was in fact caused by an HCov that is that still in circulation today, in fact, the 'flu' and an HCov is so simular ~100 years ago we couldn't tell the difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lockdown sceptics simply don't believe a lockdown is a proportional response to this pandemic. Considering all government planning was very clear that they would not lockdown and instead use measures to flatten the curve to a sufficient degree that hospitals could cope. Our influenza plan specifically said we should be prepared for over 300,000 people to die in a 15 week period, however it seems despite initially following the plan, it was disregarded for unclear reasons. The evidence suggests that there was no particular basis for prolonged lockdowns in our planning and to say sceptics are "distorting the science" when they are simply supporting our own governments plans is just flat out wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Leading scientists advising the UK government have proposed a two-week national lockdown in October to try to tackle the rising number of coronavirus cases. The move highlights how Boris Johnson might come under increasing pressure to introduce a second national lockdown, even though he has said he is strongly against such a measure. Experts on the government #8217;s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-m) have suggested a national lockdown that could coincide with the October school half-term. The government is keen to avoid the reclosure of schools, having shut them during the national lockdown in March and only fully reopening them this autumn. That helps to explain why the government #8217;s scientific advisers have looked at how a two-week national lockdown might coincide with the October half- term as part of efforts to bring Covid-19 under control.  #8220;As schools will be closed for one week at half-term, adding an extra week to that will have limited impact on education, #8221; said one scientist who is a member of Sage, confirming the body had considered the case for a national lockdown in October. Another scientist who is a member of Spi-m said the body had also looked at a national lockdown that could take place next month. The number of positive Covid-19 cases is doubling every seven to eight days in England, according to statistical analysis released last Friday by Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori. The analysis estimated the reproduction rate of the virus, or the R, the average number of new cases generated by an infected person, stood at 1.7, meaning the disease is spreading exponentially. The scientist who sits on Sage said if the R number continued at the same level as currently, it would  #8220;break the NHS #8221;, adding that the test-and-trace system was  #8220;creaking at the seams #8221;. On Wednesday, the prime minister told MPs that a second national lockdown would be  #8220;disastrous #8221; for the economy.  #8220;I don #8217;t want a second national lockdown  #8212; I think it would be completely wrong for this country and we are going to do everything in our power to prevent it, #8221; Mr Johnson said. But much is likely to hinge on whether the government #8217;s new  #8220;rule of six #8221; rule  #8212; restricting social gatherings to six people  #8212; serves to halt the rise in Covid-19 infections.  #8220;If it doesn #8217;t work, a whole range of unpalatable options come into view, #8221; said a government official. The official added that at the top of the government there was  #8220;a very strong reluctance to go anywhere near another national lockdown #8221;, but said:  #8220;There #8217;s a difference between not wanting to go back to another lockdown and having to go back. #8221; A government spokesperson said:  #8220;The government is continuing to closely monitor infection levels and taking decisive action to protect people such as introducing local lockdowns and banning gatherings of groups larger than six.  #8220;Scientific and medical professionals have provided advice throughout the pandemic. #8221; On Thursday, the north-east of England became the latest area of the UK to have a local lockdown imposed on it because of rising Covid-19 infections. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, held talks last week with Sadiq Khan, London #8217;s mayor, and local council leaders to discuss contingency plans for new restrictions in the capital, but such an outcome is not seen as  #8220;inevitable #8221;, according to government insiders. Meanwhile Dido Harding, who heads the government's test-and-trace programme in England, said she  #8220;strongly refuted #8221; suggestions that the scheme was #160;failing. Following widespread reports of people struggling to obtain tests, because of capacity limits at laboratories that process results, Baroness Harding defended herself against accusations that the government had failed to prepare for a predictable surge in demand when children returned to school. She said lab capacity had doubled between the end of May and September and emphasised that this had been done in accordance with information supplied by Sage.  #8220;We built our testing capacity plans based on Sage modelling, #8221; said Baroness Harding. After Mr Hancock announced on Tuesday that for the time being certain groups would be prioritised for tests, Baroness Harding said hospital patients would have first call, followed by those in care homes, then NHS workers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By all metrics we locked down too early as there was no hospital systems overwhelmed. Remember lockdowns are just a delay tactic when flattening the curve fails.  gt;the public's response to the rules The publics response to rules was better than expected, at least in the most important inital period.  gt;not wearing and enforcing mask wearing early enough There was a PPE shortage and the evidence regarding masks is flimsey at best. Good read here if you are interested: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2020.1797997 Edit: I would like to expand on the 'locked down too early argument' . As this sub moans about exponentials all the time they should realise that it goes in both directions, in a lockdown cases will decrease dramatically at first and then the rate will slow down in an exponential decay. Compare the graphs of say 5e^-x and 10e^-x, you will see that despite different starting points, they decrease to the same low value in a reasonably simular time, hence the argument that if we had locked down earlier we would be ok is flawed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, I quickly used some ZOE data to knock up a rudimentary epidemic model: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/r6srqygxrr (Y axis cases, X axis days). As you can see, despite the red curve having double the initial starting value (5 million more cases in this example), the black curve is only about a week ahead when cases get down to low levels. So even if we had locked down a week earlier, it doesn't really return any time later atall.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A 14-day circuit breaker assuming an R of 0.8 (the last lockdown was 0.6 but I guess it will be higher due to decreased compliance) will buy you 14 days(at post lockdown R=1.2). So it is quite literally a 1 to 1 delay tactic. Considering we are going to have to be waiting months for a vaccine, a 14-day delay at low levels seems pointless to me, a much better option would be a 'circuit-breaker' at much higher levers, therefore higher levels of immunity in the population; much more simular the original Imperial Report suggestion. Does that make sense, considering the downvotes I would like a response?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"This means that if a vaccine has been found to meet the safety, quality and effectiveness standards by the MHRA then vaccinations can begin without needing to wait for the European Medicines Agency who  #8211; up until the end of the transition period in 2021  #8211; would have been the only body able to grant a licence." My prediction is first week of November if we are looking at beating the EMA. I can see semi-normality by the new year with 5 million or so of the vulnerable vaccinated. If we can just get the care homes vaccinated that would cut the deaths by a third. I'm hoping there has been alot of work for the rollout to be as fast as possible. Would be a big win for Johnson if we could relax restrictions on the 1st of January.</TEXT>
