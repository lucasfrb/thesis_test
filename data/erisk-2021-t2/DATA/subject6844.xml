    <TITLE>Live Balance Change - September 26, 2020</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-27 01:37:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>After listening to feedback from players before, during, and after today's tournament, we realize that Weapon Check was a card many felt to be frustrating to play against. We've chosen to implement a live fix for the card and will continue to watch it closely from here. Should we use this approach in the future, we will be sure to give at least 20 minute warning. Weapon Check All minions have ~~their strength locked to zero~~  #8594; -3/-0 Refunds for people who crafted it before now will be made available before or with the next patch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whether it is currently too good or not quite good enough is something we'll continue to monitor and assess. The more pressing matter for us was that regardless of power level, it needed to feel less oppressive. We think this change should definitely help with that feeling and serve as a good place for us to continue to monitor from. Please feel free to leave some feedback for us about the card as we spend more time playing with this new iteration in the coming days.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Expansion 2 Development Update</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-02 20:36:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>We're so happy to see everyone enjoying the Rings of Immortality expansion. We're also proud to announce that the gameplay design for our next expansion will be wrapping up very shortly (possibly as soon as later today) and we have some details to get your minds wandering. We're going to be exploring some "subfactions" within the various factions in Mythgard. I hear that the Orange subfactions are "The Resistance", "Magic of the Desert", and "Thearchy". You can also expect to see several more Jinns but maybe with a brand new twist!</TEXT>
