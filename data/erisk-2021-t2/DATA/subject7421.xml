    <TITLE>Unemployed Wantrepreneur - What work can I do for you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-04 20:31:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Unemployed Wantrepreneur - What work can I do for you? 2016 college grad, returning for an MBA in 2018 or 2019. I have a few business ideas I'd like to flesh out more within a grad program, and feel its especially important to get an MBA as a future self-employed entrepreneur. I'm 30, and have been continuously employed since 16. I majored in Parks and Recreation, with a business minor; my BS doesn't get me far in the business world. (One of those times I wish I had gotten that finance degree.) I recently lost my job and receive unemployment. This is the first time I've been fired. While it wasn't going great recently (a lot of changes, MIA management), it was a cornerstone of my MBA applications. I had been working hard for the past 18 mos., and now I can't even use them for a recommendation. Nothing wild happened, but the owner can be emotional, and fired several people over apparently nothing. I had been looking for another job anyway. Side note: I was in an accident 2 years ago that has left me with pain to manage, and a lot of debt. I was a student at the time of my accident, with low income, no insurance, and was on my own independently. Until the accident claim is over (i.e., settlement money), I can only do so much about the debt. Much of it is in collections, 2 companies have garnished wages. Long story short, I have an attorney and it should be resolved in the next 10 months, but I have no firm timeline beyond that. I explain this to say - I have no credit and very limited income, and this has been the case for a while. No friends or family can help out any more financially than they already have. Asking for a loan or anything along those lines is not an option unfortunately. I feel and have felt stuck because of the accident; I am no longer an able-bodied young person, and cannot start a business raking leaves or blowing snow singlehandedly. I don't even own a car. I have tried to put together small gigs, but ultimately I just don't have enough resources to grow. I can't explain how defeated and depressed I feel over it some days. I don't let it get me down, but what more can I do besides have a positive attitude? I am excited to get a good job. I want to make enough money to control of my life again. Like, 40k/ yr would be a dream. I need a job that: * pays $17+hr * remote or accessible by foot * relates to professional interests, pursuit of grad school I have worked in food, retail, small and large business. My interests include supply chain, finance and management, and background includes administration, retail and sales, animal welfare, and travel. I am currently: * applying for jobs * studying for the GMAT passively; I'll take as soon as I can afford to. * getting fit and focusing on physical recovery * reading business books * getting Google Ad Word certified - What else could I do like this? * building an online portfolio * Continually organizing notes and creating business plans, summaries, etc with friends/ partners **What I want right now is to pursue a more independent career and lifestyle, that keeps me on track to grad school and beyond.** I'd love to work remotely or independently. I am smart, savvy and resourceful. I'd be happy at an office job as well, so long as its more than answering phones and greeting people. I will have health insurance through my SO's provider starting in January, so I am open to independent contractor type of work. I cannot relocate until the accident claim is over, so while teaching english/ going abroad sounds great, it is not in the cards right now. I honestly feel a little aimless, continually doing all these things without more meaning behind it. Feedback and/or advice would be much appreciated! If you've got work you feel I could help with, please PM me!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: We should not be asked to tip for coffee and other "to go" orders (US)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-11 17:03:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I understand that in a service environment, tipping is reasonably expected. Going to a restaurant or bar, getting a massage, etc, and being waiting on is an entirely different experience IMO to grabbing a $3 coffee or getting take out (i.e., pizza). Simply put, the food costs $20. I order the food and agree to pick it up. The agreement is $20 for food that I pick up. What am I tipping for? Is this not exactly what they advertise and what I agreed to? Food for $20? Why would they expect me to pay extra, when I didn't get anything exceptional? Again, if there is a delivery service, then I can understand the expectation of a tip. Furthermore, this is America, so I am not shocked that more companies are suggesting tips for their employees, because why not? However, I feel like we've really lost touch with the idea that tipping is OPTIONAL. While its customary, it can be rude to expect one. I find it kind of audacious that the pizza shop prints 15, 20 and 30% "suggested tip" amounts at the bottom of the receipt, as if I'd ever be inclined to tip 30% for a carry out order. Yeah, I enjoy this pizza place, but I'm not going to just give them extra money because of it. I'll keep going back and recommend them to others; I feel like this is a normal and reasonable approach to supporting a business. I feel that tipping for carry out is very much "tipping them for doing their job." On the other hand, when I am at a restaurant, I chat with the server, ask for food recommendations, and there's a level of engagement that makes me feel GOOD about leaving a tip, because I appreciated their help and they improved my experience. That is their job, but they served me as an individual, so it was still unique IMO, and worthy of a tip. Along those lines, when I've had bad service (wrong orders, no refills, forgetting silverware, etc) - I tip low or not at all, and sleep like a baby at night over it. Friends have argued that in many of these instances, the server is overworked and has too many tables, so its even more of an injustice to tip low. That argument solidifies my attitude of not tipping though, because tipping for poor service would encourage them to continue doing it; tipping is a way to show that everything is great and the experience was good. When I am inside of a place for 2 minutes, what are they expecting me to tip for? What am I saying when I don't tip, other than I don't believe there is a reason to tip? I am a regular at several coffee shops. I tip between $.50 and $1.00 depending on what I get, and when its under $3, I don't usually tip at all. I feel conflicted about this: on one hand, I am not comfortable tipping $.60 for an espresso, because its already ridiculous that they charge $3, and now its $4 with taxes  amp; tip. On the other hand, I like this coffee shop and want to support it, so maybe tipping helps keep things moving. I don't want judgement from the staff, but really IDGAF about their judgement, I care about my coffee. If they want me to pay more for coffee, just raise your prices. If their employee's pay is based on "optional" tipping, then its not a sustainable business model, and I wouldn't want to support that anyway. I'm trying not to dive deeper into tipping culture as a whole, but I do want to acknowledge that in previous discussions I've had about this, the opposing side often suggested: if I have a problem tipping, then don't go to places that ask for tips. This seems ideal, but its not realistic; its everywhere! I'd have to go out of my way to avoid it, and furthermore, tipping is OPTIONAL (unless you're 8+ party, etc). A big part of my job is meeting clients, and I have yet to find any place that doesn't ask for tips, regardless of what food/drink/ service they offer. While there is an idea that you should walk in anticipating you'll tip 20%, I just don't. I tip what I feel is reasonable, and feel its audacious to assume I'll tip 20% just because. TL;DR: I feel like an asshole, but would feel like sucker for tipping on unexceptional experiences. I don't want to close myself off from the world of coffee shops and carry out thai, but WTF is the deal with expecting a tip for (seemingly) nothing? P.S. Yes, I have spent time in Europe and prefer their approach to food service and food service careers. I would love to see servers get paid well, for the price to just BE the price, and for the experience to be more about the food and less about how many tables the server is juggling. I understand that there is a difference, and in America being a server can be an amazing opportunity to make good money (mostly tax-free). However, it find it impertinent that the foundation of food businesses expect their customers to pay the employees, on top of the premium prices for the food. Its a broken business model. _____  gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

    <DATE>2018-10-12 12:55:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realize that words "ask" and "question" are very similar, but used differently in English depending on the context. Maybe I should think "Can I ask something?" instead of saying both ask and question in the some sentence, as it is repetitive. Is there a different word for each in German? What is the polite phrase similar to "may i ask something?" or "i have a question"? Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Relocating to Dusseldorf with dog - unfurnished flats?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-14 09:45:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! Any quick advice would be super appreciated. My husband and I just arrived to Dusseldorf and are looking for an unfurnished flat for  lt;800 #8364;/ mo. We are American and do not speak much German yet. I am starting school here in February. I know its a process to find a flat like this, and we are hoping to find something by December 1st. We have a dog back in the US and will send for him after we get a flat. I am having trouble finding a site to look for unfurnished flats. Can we get an agent to help with this search? I have sent 10+ emails from online listings, and gotten 1 response, where they eventually cancelled. I am finding help but only for furnished flats, which we don't prefer (cost is higher and we want to personalize our space). We are happy to be anywhere close to Ubahn and stores, so it doesn't have to be Dusseldorf city if there's better options outside the city. A locals perspective would be great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that there is no simple answer, as it depends on what kind of work you do, if you have partners, etc., but I was curious what the most advantageous US states are for an entrepreneur. If you could choose any state's rules, which would it be? I am looking at Nevada, for the income tax and fluidity with establishing a corp from outside the state or country. I work in the US and Europe, and am working more with European entrepreneurs who are interested in expanding to the US. As we have discussed pros and cons, its made me consider - is there 1 state most ideal for foreigners or dual citizens who live primarily outside the US?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone here have a 2nd international number? Any recommendations? I have the Pixel 2, and just relocated to Germany from the US. I am on project Fi, and need to get a german number. It seems like things have changed since I was last here, and its a bit more complicated to get a 2nd number. (I have an address which is required here now to get a number.) I was looking at the Whatsapp SIM that is 10 euro/mo. I do not have a SIM in my phone right now because it wasn't needed, so I understand I could use the whatsapp one then, right? I don't quite understand how it works, and don't want to get a SIM and screw up anything with Fi. I understand Fi doesn't offer support outside the North America (its been working perfectly here BTW), so I especially don't want to screw any thing up that requires I ship my phone back to the states.

    <TITLE>Dumb question: how can I re-post articles on my site?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-16 16:38:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to create a consumer blog. For now its just a hobby idea. I have an opinion on everything, I shop a lot, and know a lot of stores and brands quality, etc. I regularly get asked and tell people about my experience with products, and often point them to amazon or another specific store. Even if just for my own fun, I want to write posts highlighting some of my favorite things. I hope I can make money down the line with ads or something. My idea is simple enough: all things -american- consumerism. product reviews. projects explained. I want to create a space to learn more about a product you are interested in buying, or a company you're investing in. I'll be your pal for unadulterated personal opinion, with educated and researched pros and cons. I want to build this site for a while before really telling the world, to get some content under my belt first. My question: can I take good articles; product reviews, product reveals, news, announcements, etc, and re-post them on my site in some way? I'd obviously give credit to the original source. Can I copy and paste it as I have seen with so many entrepreneur.com articles that seem to be on so many other sites? How does this work? If I disabled ads for that page, would that be enough not to"not profit off of their work"?</TEXT>

Every other app seems to make noise in some way, I absolutely hate it, and some apps I cannot change that setting (especially when it is first booting, i.e., pokemon go). So I keep my phone volume at zero, otherwise I get noise randomly. I cannot hear my phone unless the volume is over 3. Is there a ring-only setting I am missing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I finally found a local dealer and got the fattest nug from him. Unfortunately it seems it wasn't dried well enough or something, because there's this white wispy shit spreading from its stem. It's mold. I've had this stuff for ~10 days, and kept it in a jar most of this time. I have never ever experienced moldy weed before you guys, what the fuck. All this dank fucking weed is garbage. I don't think I smoked any of the moldy parts but of course I panicked about it for 15 mins last night anyway. So damage control: * Cleaning my (glass) stash jar with alcohol (then airing it out for a while) is enough to reuse it eventually, right? * Do I need to clean my grinder as well? * Is it an issue that my dealer gives me the goods in an unsealed bag? I was rather besmirched the first time he handed me an opened baggie (like a produce bag), but don't want to get all nit picky. I've bought from this dealer a few times now and the rest seems great (allbeit light). I don't know how to feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I sized myself using the calculator and received a 34JJ/K size. This aligns with my history of being a 34 all my adult life, and my history of an ever-growing chest. I am actively losing weight but have only gone up in cup size over the past 2 years somehow, despite being 32 years old and not taking any new forms of BC or any other hormones. /rant. **Where can I find a full-support bra without any seams on the cups?** I am a simple person and just get nude and black bras, as this suits my wardrobe best. * Seams across the cup always irritate my nipples and they will be hard the entire time I wear the bra. * I don't like lace or *anything* on the cups because it often shows through my clothes in some unflattering way. Bravissimo only offers seams-across-the-nips style in my size. I've checked brastop, changelingere.de, and even Nordstrom and am struggling to find bra that *looks* like it will be comfortable. I have heard great things about Curvy Kate but they all seem to have seams across the cup as well. I live in Germany, and I need to be able to return any items in case of a poor fit. My favorite brand used to be Natori but I haven't fit in their bras in years. I haven't worn a proper bra much in the past year because I just cannot find a comfortable fit, despite going to Bravissimo in person and spending over 300 at similar stores. I don't know if this is the best way to say it but my boobs are full, round, and basically point pretty straight; the cone shaped bras are absolutely awful for my boob shape and I have found a lot of these in my size. **Measurements** Loose: 88cm Snug: 86 Tight: 84 Standing: 110 Leaning: 117 Laying: 144 Any advice is super appreciated!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-07 09:44:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am confused and could use some guidance. I am a freelancer online (US citizen) and get a 1099 from one company, but do various projects with no 1099 supplied. I have been working like this for ~1 year, and am preparing to file my taxes. I would like to start a company XYZ Ventures, LLC and be self-employed by them, and be able to employ/ contract others under this business in the future. I have a few business ideas and things are up and going. My spouse and I have similar professional skills, and I want to create a business so we can remain in Europe long term, self-employed, and eventually employ others (who are US citizens, working remotely). (We will have a European branch eventually as well, but thats not relevant this year.) So I am trying to figure out how to establish a business where we are contractors/ self-employed (US citizens that work remotely). The way I understand it (please correct me if I am wrong) is that I can: * declare a business * employ myself under this business * report all income under business name * deduct business expenses * supply myself, spouse with a 1099 under XYZ Ventures for the 2020 year I began this process a while back, before I was generating any income or got a 1099. I registered the business and got a EIN, got a registered agent in the same state.. and now I am confused how to move forward. Additionally, I am a US citizen but did not reside in the US at all last year, and all my work was done remotely. How do I account for that, when trying to be an entrepreneur? I now reside in Germany and will be filing taxes in Germany this year for the first time - I want to show that I am self-employed by my own company established in the US on my taxes in Germany, but i need to finish establishing the business in the US. Any assistance on this would be much appreciated!</TEXT>

You can't walk your face away from it once it's been sprayed at you. Like the other comment said, you're likely to be looking right at the person pepper spraying you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am sorry. I completely relate to the misery of non-stop disappointments with bras. I don't have any specific recommendations for 42K unfortunately. I am not sure if an extender would work for size 38-40 bras, but if you're struggling to find the right size, I might suggest buying a fee in various cups and bands around 42K (as another mentioned, trying a 44 may provide better comfort?).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So like, personally, I am wearing a makeshift tube top kind of bra. It's 2 different stretchy bras from Target that I just pulled the straps down with. My shoulders can't take the weight or pain any more. I have pain shooting up my back. My whole left side seems to ache from the lack of support, but I just can't wear the weight on my shoulders anymore. I plan to go to a doctor soon to seek a referral for breast reduction. I didn't want to go this route but I honestly haven't found a well fitting bra in over a year. My best fitting bra is a 34J; I don't fill in the cups at the top in a weird way, the underwire pokes and rubs and hurts, and the lace surrounding it it's godawful itchy. I think it's made entirely of polyester, it's absolutely miserable to wear. But I wore it for a year and lately it's only used in desperation with formal dresses, since I need something. I am working on a bra and underwear company concept to address these kind of pain points, but fast fashion  amp; lingere is saturated industry. It will take me years to truly manufacture good bras. Wtf do I do in the mean time...? I wear this makes it tubetop  #128528; #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It *is* illegal to hang anything off your rearview mirror is **most** states. They are only supposed to be hung while the car is parked, in essence; i.e., parking placards. It's crazy, but it's true. It's a lame excuse to pull anyone over and I've rarely heard about it happening, but it's always a bizzarre story when it's an issue. tbh i think some states have laws that imply cops cannot reasonably pull you over for such a weak (low level infraction) reason **alone**; you have to also be speeding or make an illegal turn or do something else also worth stopping you and possibly wasting both your time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh god I know a couple who had an 'engagement ceremony', if that's what you could call it. They had been dating since high school, and were now ~22. She was this insecure and aggressive type of person. He was a total teddy bear and I chronically felt bad for how mean she seemed to be to him. She started to become really overbearing and pressuring him to propose around the time he was graduating college and looking at grad school (out of state, where she didn't want to go). She planned his proposal for her. I still don't understand it. I got an invitation and everything. They had a party some Saturday, something like a formal potluck. He was scheduled to pop the question in a room at 2:00pm. It sounded absolutely cringy and awful. I refused to attend this or their actual (another sad story) wedding, solely because of the principal of how *weird* she treated him. I'd say different strokes for different folks, but she gave me the willies. I was a few years older than them at the time and had been divorced at 23 from a psycho abuser. She had so many red flags. He went on to go to grad school at his alma mater/ her hometown. They had a baby recently. I still feel bad for that guy. She seemed to suck all happiness from everything and he was in too deep to get out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Curriculum definitely varies by university and professors, but as a class of 2020 MBA grad... I tend to agree that current curriculum is behind. If a professor is older/ not interested in digital marketing, it will be glossed over at best. I was a TA for Entrepreneurial Marketing in my undergrad, and it was an excellent class that changed every semester to keep up with trends and guest speaker topics. The prof. repeated a self-invented marketing framework, then used practical cases and real life examples to drive the framework's success if implemented. She couldn't say enough about marketing and it was a lot of fun to experience the class as a student, then as a assistant for another year. First and only mentor in my life.</TEXT>

I have found threads addressing the question but no answer on the manual removal of each file by date.

    <TITLE>I finally found a bra that fits - but I cannot stand the underwire (34J)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-07 09:20:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Godbless Curvy Kate, I am so happy to have found some relief. My breasts have grown recently and I have been unable to find a good fit for months. My breasts just ache. The thing is, the underwire is impossibly uncomfortable. (I've had this experience will Panache bras as well). I do not understand how ANYONE can tolerate this! I am really at a loss; is there NO HOPE for J cups if you find underwire painful or suffocating? It digs into my ribs under my breasts, and they POKE ME from end to end! I wore this curvy kate bikini top (somehow it was easier to find a 34J bathing suit bra??) ~7 times in 2 weeks, and the underwire actually popped out (from the top of the cup, at the center of my chest). IN 2 WEEKS. I intend to get a breast reduction, but that isn't as quick of a fix as just finding a good bra, right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks so much for the feedback. The wires actually popped from a 34JJ, which was a bit too large in the cups but generally a welcome level of support. I bought it out of desperation because other 34J's were a weird fit, and I would wear the bra over a t-shirt to pad the wires, especially at my chest. Since it at least helped my breast pain, I went ahead and ordered a 34J. While waiting for it to arrive, the JJ wires popped. I got the 34J today and its a bit more snug, but the underwires are completely uncomfortable! For a moment, sure I can wear it, but I cannot stand wearing this even 30 mins without absolutely fidgeting with all 4 corners of the underwire + the pain of the wire hitting my ribs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks so much for your thorough reply! I agree that this size isn't the most convenient for finding good bras. I guess I am very projected and have a full shape. I've never fit into plunge styles because my boobs just pop or slip out. I have always kind of found of the sides of underwire uncomfortable - am I crazy? I cannot help but notice exactly where the underwire ends. They often flex and move as I move, and I usually tuck my shirt into the edge of the bra to help make a buffer. I tended to wear the same Natori bras year after year (until I outgrew them  #128557;) because they were some of the only fits I could wear 8-10 hours. Otherwise I was in XXL sports bras. This bra was the ONLY bra I have found (in years) that actually touches my sternum like they are "supposed to;" for me, most bras are super flimsy at the center and are swimming in cleavage. Curvy Kate has been the best fit I have found in 2 years, and it's not even tolerable. It's so miserable wasting so much time and money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for the offer to take a look at my measurements! I am away from home and my measuring tape right now, so I will message you again tomorrow. I really appreciate the long response, it's really helpful. I think you are pretty spot on about the wide root and projection; I don't quite know how to describe them, but they are big and heavy and full. The tissue is more firm than soft. They are also pretty round and centered, in that cone shape bras are a total misfit. I think you're right that I probably have more breast tissue on my side that might be where it pokes. I have found my favorite bras are ones that have underwire rest further back under my arm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Different culture and medical system. I'm an American who has lived abroad and currently in Germany; it's WILD how different medicine is around the world. For example, I have never gotten an exam in Germany, despite getting controlled substances and other prescriptions. No one cares about my temperature, blood pressure or current medications. They do no general checks or ask questions before discussing my issues (like feeling ill for days), which I always find ODD because a fever is a significant indicator. I have rarely ever even been touched by a doctor in my worst moments of pain or illness. The US has the best standards of practice worldwide, I am certain.</TEXT>

He also got a super low/ $2 tip. The service was awful and it took over 3 hours to order and all eat our meals, because it was a shit show of wrong orders and the waiter never being around. He was pissed and wanted to argue for a tip, as we were a party of 6. We just walked to our cars. I get that they were overbooked and maybe understaffed. But the service was bad. The food was **bad**. It was all bad. And it lasted 3 hours because we had to fight *just to pay and leave.* And this mf wanted us to throw him some cash for helping to make this experience happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's definitely a different dining experience when the server isn't interrupting your nice meal every 12 mins try to upsell more drinks, appetizers or deserts. My only complaint really is that 1) they don't usually help you find a seat (doesn't feel welcoming) and 2) You have to flag down any server when you need something. The server may change shifts while you are eating, so no one rally notices or care that you need something (like the check).</TEXT>

There was a witness (a car who saw me and stopped, then watched the other guy not stop and hit me) who gave his statement. The man that hit me was was never charged. In in statement, he doesn't even acknowledge hitting me, only that "something jumped out in front of me." He was 91 years old.</TEXT>

I left my job at Goldman Sachs to come to Europe for an MBA; now I have network here, and a degree that allows me to stay. I don't make as much money (but I also don't speak the local language fluently yet), but I have an incredible quality of life that is more than worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd be happy to! Key things about quality of life in Europe: - reasonable days off, which is also socially/ culturally acceptable. US work culture is toxic even at the best companies. - easy access  amp; acceptance of healthy travel and recreation options; i.e., beaches, mountains, boating, biking, horse riding, skiing, etc, which is also pretty culturally ingrained as typical hobbies. Only in select areas in the US do you get acces to that, and there is a cost/ exposure barrier for much of the middle class. - low cost of living options. Food is subsidized in Germany and is wildly affordable. Every thing has been inflating beyond the wages and I just could never save money as an adult. - socialism. Society benefits when people all have access to basic healthcare. I was living the grind life when I first came to Europe 5 years ago. I could barely afford the trip. I had never taken a family vacation or any trip of this sort before. (My parents both worked in management and literally never got PTO in their 20 year career.) I was in over 30k in student loan debt with being 1/2 thru my program; I was planning to go onto medical school because I wanted to make as much money as possible to pursue FIRE. I already felt burnt out working 2 PT jobs while in school FT pursuing premed, and was seriously concerned about my future (the kind of the person I'd become to be successful). I was unsure if I wanted to keep going this path, and had always thought living in Europe would be an impossible dream. Whle the trip big deal on it's own, what immediately struck me when I got to traveling was how "free" everyone actually seemed to be. - drink beer all over the place, and people are generally responsible and respectful. - a holiday weekend where the whole city seemed to be celebrating. It was an elating experience (King's Day NL) - none of this taxes and tipping BS. Also, less upselling and aggressive sales tactics. Finally. - small talk is generally kept to a minimum, whereas Americans can be weirdly chatty and also weirdly judgemental. I spent 3 weeks in: Oslo, Amsterdam, Nice, Cinque Terre, Zurich, Vienna, Stuttgart and left from Cologne. I can home and vowed to leave the US. I did so 4 years later and have no idea when I'll leave here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>US Citizen-resided abroad for 9 months in 2019 and only made money abroad. What taxes are due to US?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 17:28:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Working with H amp;R Block, they have gone back and forth a bit (several agents have taken over this case) on what I owe and they still haven't been able to break it down or itemize how they got to $3k. $3k is fine, but its a bit higher than I expected given my income. I have been so wrapped up in moving to a new country and covid, I cannot think straight, and H amp;R Block has never made me feel too confident. **Relevant info:** * 15,000 Gross income (Germany) * 4500: 401K EW (paid 450 at the time/ Jan 2019) * 5600: Unemployment *3,200: Tax due* I collected unemployed for the first few months of 2019, (withdrew 401K for emergency), and eventually moved out of the country (EU) for the rest of the year. I have a 1099 from a US company that I worked remotely for since relocating. Its my EU address on my 1099. Out of curiosity: if I already paid the 10% penality for early withdrawal, how else do these taxes add up to $3200? Many thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was the first ex-wife in this instance. I was contacted by a newer ex; here's my story. We had been divorced about 1-2 years, after being separated for 18 month beforehand (so it's been 3-4 since I had spoken to his fool). He had BPD, was controlling, manipulative, possessive. Physically and verbally abusive. Chronic liar. When we got married, the mask came off - it was absolutely bizarre but also very textbook apparently. Couples therapy helped me because I was advised to get out asap, and eventually I took that advice. He didn't let me go after the divorce finalized. He had key loggers and spyware on all my devices; he was a software engineer. I was as 24, he was 26. He went crazy, honestly. I knew he was still actively stalking me, as he had shown up at my work and would send messages to various reddit accounts and emails. I guess he was dating, and was an awful guy (surprise surprise). He had begun making $$$ as I was leaving him (I took nothing in our divorce), and he apparently becamevery flashy with buying gifts, new cars, travels, I dunno, he seemed to be filling a hole. I didn't know this guy. In our relationship, bad things slowly escalated over 3 years. For the newer ex who reached out to me some 3-4 years after I left him - he was terrifyingly abusive. He pushed her down stairs (multiple times), pushed her out a moving car, left her places... And they only dated 9 months before she felt desperate to talk to someone about him, because of his gaslighting and lying to others. He would twist stories to be the victim, make you apologize to him, then abuse you an hour later. She contacted me. I got creeped out. Read her messages and thought it over for a few days. Agreed to a one-time conversation with her over text. We talked for about 4 hours. It was awful. I was sickened and drained. I still haven't forgotten about the things she said happened. But I reassured her, we kind of comisserated, and then I encouraged her to file a police report and a restraining order (my biggest regret) against him. And asked her to never contact me again. Bonus: we had the same first name. HE WAS SUCH A CREEP. *Edited for clarity</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;"The young girl had "severe" pre-existing conditions, but Catry warned against complacency among the healthy and that 85% of new cases diagnosed last week were among the under-60s. "It's true that it's rare that a young person dies of COVID-19, but it's clear that no-one is immune," he warned, after the number of new infections per week in Belgium jumped by 89%. Belgium has now recorded 64,847 cases of COVID-19, after being one of the countries with the highest per capita rates of infection at the height of the crisis in Europe." She is the first of more statistics sadly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Living Germany, I am finding Germans the be the most arrogant (i.e., someone politely agruing my dog breed, to me, an industry professional - they felt they knew my dog better than I did, on several occasions.) Or when you go to the pharmacy and they demand to know why you need 2 boxes (20 count) of fucking acetaminophen, like it's some crime to get 2. Pharmacists have refused to sell normal OTC goods just based on their judgement. That's pretty arrogant. What are the Dutch like in contrast? I figure I would prefer to settle down in NL in a few years, because it seems more laid back. I am not German. Because of this I will probably never fit in, and I'm not sure I like the culture I am experiencing. Some people are nice, but also weirdly callous and rude in ways I find I could never be friends with many of these people. And I feel myself becoming a bitter callous person in the process. ..</TEXT>

It will probably take you ~2 years to get to NL if you plan now. Do a master's in Europe. With that degree, you can usually stay and find a job after. That's how I am relocating from the US to Europe anyway.</TEXT>

When they come to mind, I acknowledge the memory, tell myself 'it was good while it lasted' (i.e., something positive and meaningful), and then **let it go**. Turn on a song. Work on some hobby. Change the subject in my mind. Everytime they pop into my mind, I give myself 30-60 seconds to reflect, then move on. It gets easier day by day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My parents birthdays are coming up. For the past 8 years, I have been more or less broke. I have barely been able to mail a gift, and usually only send a card and give them a call. I live out of the country (and have most of my adult life). I would like to send them something extra special this year. My mom loves: * cats * crafting (cross stitch, knitting, etc) Dad: * Military veteran * loves grilling and woodwork * enjoys gardening The both like the color green. Any ideas?</TEXT>

It just wasn't an option in my situation, and I thought my situation was - ya know - the normal adult experience after you leave home. It's cool if your parents are willing to support you after 18, but it's bizarre to ASSUME they will just go above and beyond the minute they are no longer legally obligated to help you at all. I was always taught you're on you're own at 18, and then it seems like no one actually expects that to happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am considering an iPhone, as I now live permanently abroad (and want to have customers service locally). But I'm holding off because I am in between jobs and it's a rough time to buy a new phone. I am considering getting another used pixel 2 (with a warranty, in case the camera gives out on that one, too), or a 3a - just something cheap to tide me over until I have higher income.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I did a semester of college when I was 19, then dropped out for 4 years to work and be on my own. I had no idea what I really wanted to study, I was exhausted from high school, and had to work FT just to afford rent and food anyway. So I worked entry level jobs for years, until I felt ready to start college (@ 22, married (but seperated/ divorcing) so FASFA was different for me at that point, and it was amazing to finally get to access college with grants and loans. I did 2 PT semesters at first, paid by myself with all the savings I had (because I got accepted and I didn't know deferrals were a thing) while I was married and stuck under his income level, then was able to show I was singl and making $5k/ year - boom - loans everywhere. I could barely get by on loans and I always had a job, but I dragged myself through college, and am now graduating this year with my MBA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, going on a limb here: if you have sprinklers, set them to motion activation. George will be spooked by the water and ideally associate your yard with scary random sprinklers over a short time. You can put it on a timer, so it only goes off at night or during certain hours when your cats are not as likely to be outside as well (unless you want to scare them off your yard, too). This involves a little extra work, but it definitely works over time. I have battled neighborhood cats for years, and besides a hose in the moment, motion sensitive lights and water tend to spook troublemakers from coming back over and over. Eventually you don't have to keep the settings like that; just for a brief ~1-3 months until George officially backs off.</TEXT>

You can sit her down and tell her this, and then go see a 3rd party (counselor) to discuss it more in detail. Tell her you want to marry her, but can't if she doesn't change. Then if she doesn't change, leave. There are penty of cool girls in the sea that also handle being a 30 year old competently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My best suggestion is Etsy. Look for.godts for him, and just go down the rabbit hole. I just found the perfect gift for my dad for his bday (mom's bday is a week later, then it's my husband's + 2 p Nephews early in the month - omg I feel you). Otherwise, my SO and I often give the gift of experiences. It makes the budget a bit flexible, and it makes the day special, unique and memorable. My SO and I are in our ~30's and are at point where money is too tight to do anything wild, so gifts can be hard to nail beyond simple $50 things they kind buy themselves if they really wanted it. We go on fancy dinners, take hikes, drive out of town to a destination area, take selfies... We used to travel around locally cheap but this year - I dunno.</TEXT>

I typically take 90. I wish I had advice. The age-old advice is to do more to make yourself tired during the day, and go to bed as soon as you feel sleepy. A routine always helps, and use your bed only for sleep  amp; sex. I changed my nighttime routine and it seems to have helped; I don't do anything before coming to bed if possible, so I can drag my tired self right to in and go to sleep. I brush my teeth 2-3 hours earlier, then drink only water. I change into PJs at 7-9pm, with a 10:30 bedtime. (Asleep by midnight ideally).</TEXT>

It was infuriating. I had to dump him. And years later, he doesn't seem to have changed at all - he's just an idiot.

My ears can't take the noise and its impossible to carry on conversation with that kind of distraction. I am an avid dog owner and lover. My dog honestly rarely barks, never indoors, not likely even for intruders. I'm still tramatized from having yappy dogs all my childhood. OP, your dogs seem to be bothering your neighbor.</TEXT>

I am not nearly as productive as I could be but hey, I could always be better.

    <TITLE>Sensory options for 34J/JJ(UK)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-28 13:01:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi my boobyfriends, I have found a [well-fitting bra in 34J](https://www.bravissimo.com/products/maya-bra-ln655/#black-ln655blk) (hallejujah). However, the fabric is so uncomfortable and irritating that I am convinced I need to seek out sensory bras at this point. I purchased 5 bras from Bravissimo ranging from 34, 36J/JJ and this is the only one I can stand wearing; it doesn't create more pain or aching in my chest over time, and the straps are nice on my shoulders. Overall, I really like this bra because it seems to be best for my frame. The front-center gore actually reaches my chest (though it pokes and irritates so much that I must but a sock or something inbetween to protect my skin). It fits perfectly, but I cannot stand the fabric or the feeling of the underwire, just as they are. I cannot help but notice all the fabric on these bras are just... unacceptable. I am wearing tank tops under to buffer the polyester fabric from my skin (which as been a huge relief as stupid looking as it is), especially whereever the underwire meets my skin. Any suggestions for a 34-36 rib cage and J+ cups? I am tired of the shoulder and neck pain associated with bad straps, stiff giant bras that I need help to put on, have trouble breathing in (compression all over my ribs and chest), and cannot bear to wear while sitting to work. I'm looking for a camisole (does someone do memory foam camis yet??) or any product that would actually fit this 34JJ size. Any recommendations are appreciated! **I am DYING for something where I have little/ no cleavage. I want everything covered and supported, up to my breast line/ modest look.** P.S. Looking to get into sewing honestly, to just make my own. I am already frankenstien monstering my bras...</TEXT>

The corporate workplace can be extremely and life-alteringly toxic, but it usually takes years and there are red flags and warning signs along the way. I have had great corporate experiences in the US, and I do find that Americans respect European's cultural norms (i.e., visiting family, who often live back in Europe, for 1-2 weeks) and allow for more vacation. The big issue in corporate America is that it's a struggle to take a vacation/ be unavailable/ enjoy your life outside of work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to politely decline wedding help from parents over the next 6 months</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-10 12:27:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>My parents are lovely, helpful, and mean well - but I rarely ask for their help, and they tend to give unsolicited help and advice that I find taxing. It's a lot of "Thanks but no thank you"s that I try not to feel too guilty about. My parents have had a tendency to give unwanted/ troublesome gifts at times, and over the years I've found a decent balance; Sometimes I say no thanks, and sometimes I indulge them. And sometimes, their help is really great! I understand its a love language that they like to do acts of service and give gifts. This is a decent compromise to keep family relationships peaceful. I know they mean well and I don't want to hurt their feelings. My mom and dad have both come to me with cute little ideas, but much of it is either 1) way too early to discuss right now/ something I do not want to make a firm decision on yet 2) a bad interpretation of the little things I have asked them to help with, or 3) totally unwanted and unsolicited help/ ideas/ 'do you want me to buy this for your wedding?' - which is the worst and weirdest to respond to, because I usually need to reply in a hurry. That being said, we do not really see eye-to-eye on taste and style, and furthermore, they keep trying "help" in ways that I find inappropriate given their role in our wedding. I have had to say 'no' a lot, or redirect their idea/ gift concept to something more useful/ practical/ desirable. **My wedding is ~8 months away**, and I don't need much help with it until its ~3 months away. We are shooting for a smaller, simple, under 10k kind of wedding, and as much - at this time, there is little to do in preparation for it (besides lose weight  amp; tone up, am i rite?). We have our venue reserved and made an announcement; I plan to send formal invitations around February/ March which gives guests 3+ months notice, with a 6 week confirmation window before the big day. Most help is needed the weekend of the wedding itself (several people, hands-on), with some basic 'Can I have this mailed to you and you bring it?' kind of coordinating. I am relying on my bridal party to help with a few odd things, and have asked both of my parents to do something special for me/ us for our wedding, which they are happy to do but - it doesn't need to be done until next spring. It's way too early for them to help with anything else I have in mind. While I appreciate them coming to me with these odd things, I am already tired of saying "No thanks/ its too early to plan that/ I don't really care for that look/ etc." First and foremost, I feel bad. I understand they are only trying to help, but its often a hassle. **tl;dr: How do I keep politely saying 'NOOOOOOO STAP IT EVERYTHING IS FINE AND LETS DISCUSS THIS MORE IN THE SPRING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD'**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a great suggestion. The wedding venue is a destination for everyone unfortunately, and them both being present for 2+ days is already impossible; they refuse to leave their pets in anyone else's care, so attending the wedding itself is really all I can ask of them surrounding the wedding day. I am trying to think of something I can put them on, but the thing is - I really do want to keep it simple. They want to give a ton of energy to something, and its just not yet the time to. I will just encourage them to wait until the new year to really discuss things, and will put them on a project as soon as there is something for them to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am racking my brain for a small project like this, but to be honest, I think it would only complicate things; their questions would increase 10 fold, even if I told them it was their call. I really don't know what to give them (at this time anyway!). In a way its funny; they keep making suggestions on things that my SO and I have happen to have already discussed or agreed on in some manner - so their input is just not needed (and was never asked for, so I feel blindsided by them a lot). The cake for example - we plan to do cupcakes, with 1 small cake for just the wedding party *maybe*. A cake topper discussion is a headache with them, because I don't need to justify what we already intend to do. If we do get a cake topper, we already have a few in mind (that I would probably just put on display in a different way, if that makes sense). I don't even know how to explain that I already have cake topper plans - my plans are still in a maybe phase, but I just don't need their input/ help choosing it. I will ask my mom and dad, separately and casually, if there are any wedding traditions they would like to see or help with, and then let them talk. Hopefully that will help get some ideas going.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; This is your wedding though, so try not to be too accommodating just to keep the peace. You #8217;ll regret it later if it #8217;s not what you want. This is exactly the concern I have; I know they are just excited and happy for us and want it to be special, but its adding so much unnecessary pressure to make me constantly say "no I do not like that" to such random things. I don't want to hurt their feelings, especially over a wedding!, but I cannot abide by all these ideas they throw at me. We got engaged last year, set the date 5 months ago lmao. They are just getting excited that the date is finally within view; they have been giving me wedding tips since we chose the venue/ set the date 5 months ago. We still have 9 more months to go now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I totally agree with you on the last paragraph. I know it seems ungrateful to say this, and I am very grateful for their love, support, and interest. I want to steer them in the right direction when I can, and say no nicely when I have to. I just feel like I am getting more and more bombarded with random questions. I know my wedding (and by extension, my lifestyle) are not quite what they would want for me. I moved far away from my family and home state when I was 18, and now live across the country (CA  amp; NY distance). With covid, there will be no dress fittings with moms or anyone in the wedding party/ family except for my MOH, as she is the only one that lives near me. I had planned to fly out this month to attend another wedding, then squeeze in some dress fittings w/ mom and cousins before flying back, but things change and everything was cancelled. This sucks, but it is what it is. I cannot afford to visit my parents any time before a few days prior to our wedding. This makes planning and doing things with them hard. I am planning my wedding from afar; my parents don't live in a city of want to get married in/ make everyone come travel to, so I chose location a few hours away from them that is nice for everyone to come visit. And it's on the beach, which is our dream. The venue itself it's inherently troublesome for my parents to get to, but any venue would have been unless we got married within an hour of their home. I think I need to give them an updated timeline on the wedding planning, with some juicy details and requests for feedback, so they have a better idea of what I have in mind now. One project I can probably put them on early is flowers; I have very little preference on flowers besides color. Maybe they can have field day with that...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks so much for your insights. Full disclosure, I am the only girl out of 6 kids and the only one likely to get married or have kids any time soon. Brothers older and younger don't have much dating history, no grandkids yet... My parents don't have the money to cover the costs of a wedding and I know they want to make the most of what they can offer. They are definitely the most interested in our wedding (SO's parents are in their 70's and live abroad/ busy enjoying retirement). I'll try to arrange a video call with my parents just to chat about wedding plans - even though it's still really early, I now have some plans that I didn't have when we set the date this past summer. I know it breaks my mom's heart for me to live far away as it is, and now the entire wedding is basically out of her reach.  #128543; Thanks again for the parental insights, this is just the feedback I was looking for.</TEXT>

It's stupid that the solution isn't available for G+ cups, it's not like this size is unique or big boobs are a new phenomenon.

    <TEXT>Great write up. Is there an alternative version for night owls? I am absolutely not a morning person. While I do find the days I wake up early to be more rewarding and productive, it comes at the cost of my passion and overall happiness. Sure, I'm satisfied with my work, but I muted in exhaustion by the evening, and have to be in bed by 9 to get up early again. By Friday night, I'm way too tired to see friends or keep with much socializing over the weekend. I feel like a robot living by these rules. It doesn't seem like a natural routine for everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's the thing about Homelander: he has a huge ego, being all-powerful as he is. He rapes women. He kills on a whim. He's a psychopath. It's intriguing people are out to get him. In season 1, he's curious about who TF they are and why they're after him. So he tracks them down but doesn't see them as a bug enough threat to deal with; he's nursing his ego and chasing booby milk and shit. He confronts Starlight about it which effectively puts them in burn notice anyway (remember A-Train holding Hughie's dad randsom?) Then he discovers he has a son - his priority never wavers from him until the season 3 finale we just watched.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Colonoscopies are the best! I was severely constipated for over 2 weeks. I had not had a proper shit in over 10 days. Every OTC recommendation from a doctor did fuck all, and at one point I doubled all doses for days on end (per DR orders) to try to get some movement. Nothing. Worked. I was at day 14 of no BM. Finally they scheduled a colonoscopy. I was absolutely sick and in distress, and couldn't wait for this procedure so I could get some answers. 2 days before the test, they call me to pick up an RX for me to take the day before the procedure, along with some rules about fasting. The RX is a literal gallon container, with some powder at the bottom. I add water and drink. It's hard to guzzle down a whole gallon of a thing in one sitting, but I powered through. Holy hell, relief had arrived. By the time I got to the hospital for the colonoscopy, I felt much, much better. I was absolutely estastic. I still went along with the procedure, but it turned up nothing remarkable. It was honestly chill and relaxing. Absolutely worth it and highly recommend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MIL came over on Christmas day, 4 hours late, with a boyfriend who wasn't invited or known was coming. Our gifts came in Walmart bags; it was awkwardly tacky. The officially offensive thing: she refused to take her shoes off on our carpet. Our carpet was white, and we had just bought our home a few months prior. It was wet and snowy in December, her shoes were not new or clean. It drove me wild just on the principal alone. I followed her around for an hour and asked her to remove her shoes. I asked my SO to say something (he refused to even acknowledge it), and I basically had to ask MIL to leave over it. It was extremely stressful, because it was just so ridiculous; she doesn't wear shoes in her own damn home. She was flaunting how I powerless I was when it came to my SO choosing between us, in retrospect. My SO and I seperated just a few weeks later, and eventually divorced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As others have said, 1) rule out a UTI/ health issue and 2) give her additional things in the crate to ease anxiety and make it more her safe place. I can add, if she's getting enough potty breaks, I'd consider a diet (food and/or frequency) adjustment. For example, feed her 2x a day instead of 3, so she gets on a regular #2 schedule. Then if she messed in the night, it's not likely shitty. If she continues to urinate in the night after a trip to the vet, some familiar clothes/ cuddle toys added to her crate, and a diet review/ adjustment... Then give her more exercise daily so that she's so tired she sleeps through the night. She is old enough to hold it 8-10 hours. Be sure to offer her 4-6 potty breaks daily. Give her love and reassurance. She probably just needs some time to adjust to a new home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I barely graduated high school, started college when I was 24, and just completed my MBA as a B/C student. I got better grades my last 2 years of undergrad (nearly had a straight A semester!), but ended up with a 2.9 GPA upon graduating. Grades didn't effect me too much, because I had a lot of shit going on in my personal life in high school and throughout college. I didn't not make a great effort in graduate school honestly, and have a lower GPA (which I don't give a shit about. I don't want a job if they want my grades.) I have a lot of soft skills and interview well because of life experience. I know how to start a business, can hire or fire an attorney, and have a confidence in my decision making that most peers seems to lack still. I usually can land any job I can get interviewed in person for. Underprivileged kids often don't get good grades if their home life is unstable. I had good reasons for low grades and always had extra curriculars (work experience, hobbies, volunteering, etc) to show for it. Somehow, I am always able to convince someone my grades don't fully represent my worth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not OP but there is random construction waking me up between 6-7 on random days. I typically fall asleep around 12-1am (it always takes hours to fall asleep), so even at 7am, I don't feel rested because I'm jolted from my sleep to a horrible slamming noise. I don't know why, but the construction is generally only loud between 7-9am. Ugh.</TEXT>

I was active growing up and always had a nice butt, but in the last 5 years I was injured and haven't been very active. I'm in my 30's, and have lost a lot of muscle, so it all seems sad and flatter than ever.

Couples (especially ones you don't know ahead of time) are often not fun to live with - I do not recommend, especially given their behavior so far. They could quickly behave like they own the place and you're just renting a room. I hope they don't go through with it, and then you end up with 1 roommate instead of 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for pointing that out. I had chronic ear infections in my youth that have left me with super sensitive ears. I cannot stand the pain and pressure of pushing them so deeply; it's impossible to sleep with that kind of feeling. And I sleep on my side at least 50% of the time, which makes ear plugs super annoying on that side if you adjust your head slightly. Unrelated, but it's taken me years to find ear buds that fit and don't hurt, and I ended up with the ones where they wrap around the back of your ear to stay in place, so there's little pressure actually in ear my canal. It doesn't suit me.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-17 17:38:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>We have nothing but a venue reservation, which would be easy to move to a later date. It's easy enough to make an announcement that we changed the date, especially given the happy news. MOH has been trying to conceive and had a miscarriage in the last year. This pregnancy wasn't exactly planned but very wanted. I just want to support my wonderful friend the best way I can. My SO is chill with whatever is best. What would you do? Edit: The wedding is abroad/ in our home country; we are both currently living in Europe and are from the US. I figure we could push the wedding back by 3-6 weeks. She says she really wants to attend it/ see her family there as well, but I am not sure if she ultimately want to fly with a baby next summer (covid wont be gone by then, ya know?). Her 2nd trimester begins in December. She said she was really sad to possibly miss out on the wedding (I assured her she would definitely be missing the wedding unless I rescheduled, as she will be having a freaking baby!). I'm just not sure how to have my wedding w/o her there!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've honestly considered it, but we have very few friends in Europe, so a second ceremony doesn't really make sense. No one would come, and it would probably be an unnecessary cost. I'll think this over though; she was unable to have her own wedding this spring and has had to again push it back because of covid, and now the pregnancy... Maybe I can help her have *their* European ceremony before/ after the baby comes.</TEXT>
