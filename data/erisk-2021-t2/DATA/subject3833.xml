    <TEXT>Huh. I had a three hour extension...started at 2 and went to 8? I was out for all of it besides the last 40 minutes because I was exhausted. The first 1 and a half hours were horrible with connection issues (still somehow managed to get a shiny in that time) and I did notice the spawn rate was nothing like either of the beldum days I participated in. I got 6 shiny cyndaquil plus one regular 96% statted one. Averages to be one per hour, which yes, is nothing like the shiny spawn rate of Beldum day but I feel like noone should be complaining if they got atleast one. I was a spitting grumpy mess during the first hour and a half (because seriously wtf Niantic) but after the first shiny Community Day paid off for me, and the rest was icing. Comparatively my friend played about three hours and got a fat lot of shit all. RNG does as RNG will do. I'll trade her one of mine when I see her next weekend so she can't complain either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weather is not a thing you can complain about. Where it is freezing in some places of the world it is boiling in other places and perfectly fine in the rest. There is no day an event can be held where it is 100% perfect weather globally. It was hot today in where I live and the burning hot dry sun made walking a lot of extra effort. I only manged a couple of tasks myself. I think they are not clear enough with the tasks shinies and their odds (i think it was the same odds as the shiny caterpie tasks?) I also think the tasks were way to long to be completed in a three hour time window. Like wtf, hatch an egg? Its frustrating to try and fail. I think they were aiming for a fun event to mimic the original difficult way you had to get feebas in which ever game it was. They failed on the fun part. But complaining it is too hard because of weather were *you* are is a reach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. The problem is communication. If they had said upfront the shiny rate was 1/50 people would have not gone in expecting to get a shiny. Some people would still be sour grapes but some people always are. As it is it seems like 90% of the playerbase is ranging from extremely dissapointed to ready to quit. Im sure this isnt the outcome they had hoped for.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My elderly and very dead founder's spouse gave birth to a baby. I need help dealing with this.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-17 05:12:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now before anyone says it, no, it isn't supposed to happen normally and yes, it's all because of script mods. And I need your help simmers of reddit. The set up: My founder's spouse died and was very sad. His wife came back as a ghost (not a playable ghost), and thanks to wicked whims they had some very nsfw time. But she was a ghost and elderly, so I thought nothing of it. A dew days pass, and my founder cracks on to his sons widow and they conceive a child. This child, Spinel, fills up the last of the 8 sim slots for a full house when he is born. Fast forward a few days and Spinel ages up in to a toddler. Another day passes and my founder gets a call from his late wife she just gave birth to their son. I was pretty shocked. Sure enough, my founder has an extra baby in his family tree. I saw no sign she had been pregnant the entire time. From what I understand, sims that get pregnant that shouldn't be cant give birth, and end up dropping cribs everywhere when they go in to labour. None of this happened. She apparently got pregnant, had a very extended pregnancy and popped out a kid. Now, the point of this story isnt me to tell you this happened, the point is to get help with what to do about it. I now have a baby somehow tied to my legacy lot (her urn is on the lot) that I cannot see. I checked all the other households but he isn't there, and I know this kid will not be looked after. So a social worker will be called eventually right? 1) I did have the brains to upload my legacy family to the exchange while Spinel was a baby, so I can redownload them to another lot/save and keep playing and nuke the glitchly legacy family. But I will loose all my portraits and urns in the process right, and I kind of want to keep them. 2) I some how add the phantom baby to the family through a cheat and move it in with another family for them to raise. Any idea how to do this one? It seems like the cleanest solution. I really hope someone can help me with this mess. I'd like to add my game really started to chugg and lag within the last few play sessions and im thinking its due to this ghostly pregnancy. I wonder if she was dropping cribs for days but I just couldn't see them?</TEXT>

Three of wands - What are your strengths as a deck? Judgment - What are your limits as a deck? Ace of Wands - What are you here to teach me? Seven of Swords - How can I best learn and collaborate with you? The Tower - What is the potential outcome of our working relationship? The Devil It is the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, and I was planning to use it to learn, and switch to the Marigold Tarot when it arrives. The Devil card really thew me, it seems really bad? I don't seem to be able to read this deck as easy as my other Prisma Visions one. Any help is appreciated :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OP, we in the same predicament. Since the latest update my lap top I got off of ebay for 250 dollarydoos is just: "Oh the Sims 4? Yeah nah." I don't have to get one for school myself, but unless you are doing intensive 3D modeling or something any PC/Laptop you get with specs that can run the latest TS4 update should also work for school. I was looking at what is on offer at JB-HI FI, just to get an idea of what I can get for my budget. I'm looking at a particular laptop as baseline specs I want and its about $1,400 atm. I'm hoping for some good end of financial year sales after tax time though, to score something cheaper and maybe something with better specs if I am lucky. Of course if I put together a desk top I would get more power for less, but I wanna play in sims rugged up in bed lol.</TEXT>

As for your question, the deck of mine that is my current working favourite is the Dark Mansion Tarot. The Prima Visions Tarot got me reading again though. If you like ethereal feeling decks, you may like this one? The art style feels very ethereal and mystical to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fire deck recommendation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-29 01:51:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I'm hoping you knowledgeable bunch can help me. I am looking for a fire elemental deck, or a deck that just screams 'fire'. For an air deck I have the Shadowscapes Tarot, I will pull the trigger on the 2019 Mermaids for water next pay packet and for earth I have the Animals Devine (although I'd prefer an animal tarot based on Australian animals as that is what I connect with - I do not have three hundy dollarydoos for a deck unfortunately). Sometime earlier during the year I made a post on another forum looking for a "sunburst" deck, but I was kind of vague in what I was looking for and ultimately didn't find the essence I was after. I had originally been thinking about the Lili White, but I could never bring myself to pull the trigger as from what I could tell it had copyright info on the cards and I cannot get passed it. I could also potentially get an erotic deck to work, but they all the ones I've seen seem problematic in some way. So, I hope you can help me with some recommendations :)</TEXT>

I have finished DA: I 7 times, currently close to finish my 8th. I don't have a bunch of unfinished play throughs, I just play one off and on until it is complete. Still planning another run starting with Origins and ending with Inquisition. Maybe it will be done in time for DA4 :p</TEXT>

Planning a wedding is a major stressful event, and people inserting themselves "trying to help" or "wanting to feel a part of your special day" does a lot more harm than good to some couples than you may be aware of. Also if this bride is anything like me she was cringing inwardly the second you tried to insert yourself in to the plans. She is just clearly less blunt and less comfortable telling family members to back off than I was over mine.</TEXT>

But if she started complaining because /she/ refused to eat the puddings she is rude and it is on her. My sister always under provides for me and she has known my dietries for over five years. I still do not complain to her, she cooked and I didn't. Seems like a pretty massive and obvious etiquette faux paus to complain, at the dinner table, in front of other guests, about the spread. Did you offer to her something else? You are under no obligation to, but if you had something quick or easy on hand to make like a sandwich she may have appreciated it. She wouldn't have bitched you out then and you would have looked great. Or she still would have but you would know she is the asshole then and you wouldn't have to feel the need to post here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Windows 10. So I downloaded a copy of my realm (survival), mucked around with cheats on I guess and must have accidentally uploaded the cheat copy back to my realm instead? Then a windows update tanked my pc, and I had to wipe everything. A week later I have my pc working again and after a few hours of playing I notice spawn eggs are craftable in the crafting table... I could try downloading an old backup if that would even work but I don't want to undo my friends progress in the realm.
