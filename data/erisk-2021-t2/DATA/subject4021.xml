    <TEXT>So I #8217;ve always been average size with big boobs (even though most people don #8217;t realise it since I tend to wear clothes to hide them). I #8217;d like to know why most high end brands don #8217;t include sizes over DD or DDD, it makes me feel like the size I got is  #8220;not normal #8221;. Other brands only do big sizes of the cup for bras with big chest size, like people can #8217;t have a medium chest with a bigger cup. Do they not know what real people look like? Why do they only do stuff for certain people, it #8217;s so weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got out of an Uber that kept asking me the directions from a side to the other of London (about an hour). I kept trying to sleep and he was like  #8220;SO THERES A LOT OF TRAFFIC TODAY, SO ANNOYING HUH? #8221; or  #8220;DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT ROAD? #8221; while he had his gps to check. I know nothing about the roads even around my area, I don #8217;t drive and I don #8217;t care. At a certain point I told him  #8220;Alright so now I #8217;m gonna sleep so good luck #8221; and he STILL didn #8217;t understand. I fell asleep for a moment and he turned his head towards me laughing saying  #8220;SO YOURE SLEEPING HUH AHAHA #8221; and I have to say this is the most annoying type of Ubers after the smelly ones.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bad news</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-26 21:55:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just found out that a family friend (80 year old man) just got sent to a retirement home. I know it doesn #8217;t sound too bad but I #8217;m thinking about his wife that #8217;s still alive and too sick and old to care for him (she took care of him for years since he had a seizure). I #8217;m thinking about how she told me about how they fell in love and how they never spent a day of their life without each other. I #8217;m thinking that they couldn #8217;t manage to have kids and that #8217;s why now they find themselves alone in a moment of need. Because who would take two 80 year old people in their house if not their own children? Life can be so unfair, just months ago they were talking to me about how in love they are and have always been. They #8217;ve taught me the importance of taking care of each other for me and my boyfriend, they showed me what unconditional love was, no matter what. Young or old, healthy or sick. They #8217;re both brilliant and still very smart even if their bodies are so weak, and it hurts me because I know they don #8217;t deserve to end their life in some shitty retirement place where the nurses couldn #8217;t care less about them. And I #8217;m so sorry for them because they #8217;ve taught me so much and dealt with such hard things in their lives, and they never lost their mind. What always mattered for them was caring for each other and now they #8217;ll be apart. He #8217;s had a strong depression a few years ago when one of his so called friends sued him for some petty reason (about land properties) and he was really suicidal, he got back up from it and now this. Now he #8217;s in a retirement home, old and tired, still with a smart brain, but too sick to have a better life. And his wife, at home, sick too, feeling terrible for sending him there and not being able to be the supporting wife she #8217;s always been anymore. I #8217;m sorry, I just needed to get this off my chest. And no, I can #8217;t do anything about it, I moved to another country and I have no way to help them. I just feel so broken right now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ubers that cancel because of their convenience</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-08 15:53:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>So today I found myself in Central London, trying to go home, I was feeling terribly cold and thought to get an Uber. Now, I don #8217;t expect it to be too quick, I know damn well how the city works. What I think is disrespectful is 3 Uber drivers in a row to cancel on me after 10+ minutes of waiting. And one of them did something really rude. He took us in the car, he looked at our destination and told us Uber must have made a mistake and he had to cancel on us. An obvious lie. He cancelled while we were in the car and after we left we noticed it #8217;s because when we called it the fare was normal, now the area got busier and the fare almost doubled. Honestly I think that #8217;s just a really shit behaviour, I get that you need to make money but we were willing to pay the right money for when we called it so I think your morals are messed up.

    <TEXT>In my modest opinion psychology and astrology are complete opposites. Astrology is finding out about your future and behaviour because of things that happen by chance, psychology is about studying and understanding yourself to identify the causes of your behaviours. It #8217;s like astrology refuses to listen to any reason. Correct me if I #8217;m wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just read this article then came on Reddit to see if there was any community about it. I #8217;m feeling really emotional right now and hopeless about it because I could never see my loved ones looking like that, it would break my heart. At the same time I #8217;m really concerned for the long term consequences of using cortisone. I feel like there #8217;s no way to win this fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup! A lot of red flags. I don #8217;t like it when businesses get defensive under their reviews, it makes them seem childish. Accept that some people might not enjoy your class without blasting them publicly and acting rude. In another negative review they made a statement about the fact that  #8220;every bad review #8221; comes from people that were late to the class and were acting rude. That doesn #8217;t seem professional at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. The workshop said we would paint the pots we made but we also had to paint some random ready made ones because there was not enough room for all of us to work on ours. 2. We were less than 20 people and we had either 4 or 5 wheels (can #8217;t remember correctly), we worked in couples on the project so half of the group was left out and sent to paint random stuff. We took turns to work. Why would I lie about the amount of wheels there were? Maybe they had other ones in the back but we were only allowed to use these 4-5 that were on the table. 3. The owner literally called me stinky haha! What a professional business! Jokes aside, this person smelled really bad like he didn #8217;t take a shower for weeks, and I #8217;m but it #8217;s not something I #8217;m supposed to deal with when I #8217;m trying to have a good time, I don #8217;t think lack of hygiene is acceptable nowadays. It is very different from the sulfur smell in the clay, which wasn #8217;t too bad. Overall I want to say that I made this post because I #8217;m really upset that the owner has been so rude to me after I left a honest (and POSITIVE) review of their business.</TEXT>

They didn #8217;t know I can speak their language and they kept arguing about her activities on Instagram. Apparently a guy sent her a heart in DMs and she did it back. He was so pressed about it and she was talking about how  #8220;on social media we can pretend we #8217;re single even when we #8217;re not, and it #8217;s all fiction, doesn #8217;t mean anything #8221;.

    <TEXT>I swear if these people stopped doing random polls that mean nothing and actually went out to see what the world really is like, they #8217;d notice that full English breakfast still is one of the most popular dishes out there. And this isn #8217;t only about this topic, but about how the media in general try to paint things differently from what they really are because it sounds more  #8220;shocking #8221; or clickbait. Same people who claim that London is a shithole based on some random data, but never cared to go and see by themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this post just made me realise what happened in my fourth year of high school... I barely remember anything. I just remember the depression and anxiety, and the doctors. And after that year I had a big argument with my best friends about things I said/did when I was on meds and I ended up never talking to them again. Could it be that the whole ordeal happened because of fluoxetine? It would be mind blowing to find out now after all these bad years of my life are over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for the post if this is not targeted at you, but it #8217;s really getting to me lately, working in an essential business such as a supermarket. I had many beautiful customers who thanked me for my work and made me feel really good, so I can #8217;t really complain. But still every week I get customers mad at me when 1) there #8217;s a queue outside 2) when we don #8217;t have an item 3) when I #8217;m too fast or too slow for them... I wish they could just understand that I #8217;m doing my best. I #8217;m not a manager, I #8217;m just a regular employee, I have no power over what #8217;s happening whatsoever so 1) I can #8217;t choose to make you jump the queue 2) I can #8217;t know when more stock is coming 3) I can #8217;t decide to get more stock so please just let me call my manager and have little patience. I understand healthcare workers being in a rush and all but we have dedicated hours for them and we have dedicated hours for vulnerable people too. I just wish people stopped complaining to me about things that are out of my power. And I feel really bad when people get angry because of my service, I strive to do my best for all. Sorry about the rant I #8217;m probably out of line, it #8217;s my job after all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Coronavirus issues/tips</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-22 20:14:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wanted to make a post for a while now about the issues that we have to deal with because of the pandemic, and share my experience here. Let me start by saying that I work in a food hall so my work schedule got even busier through the lockdown, so no way to avoid being in busy places. My first issue with eczema was when I started wearing vinyl gloves at work, my hands got really sweaty really fast, itchy and ultimately sore. So the next thing I did was buying a few pairs of cotton gloves to wear undernearth the others, and it changed my life. I can't use them more than a couple times before having to wash them though because they get really wet (especially after 8 hours of work). Another issue was the compulsion to touch my face, scratch my nose, rub my eyes, all that. It took a while to adjust but now I can control myself better and keep the touching at a minimum. It's just about reminding yourself that the itch is in your head even though it feels like there's a bug crawling on your skin. I try to get distracted and forget about it. But the bigger issue to me was wearing a face mask for long hours though, especially while carrying heavy things and breathing hard. My entire nose-mouth area feels so wet all the time and I need to get a tissue out once in a while. I also started having a sore patch right under my nose where the steam/sweat would accumulate and it took a while to heal, just to reappear the week after. Honestly I don't really have a tip to make this easier except for maybe working less hard so I can sweat less and reduce it. This said, I'd like to hear any other tip or issue everybody had recently as a consequence of covid, so please reply with your experience! This community has helped a lot so far with making me feel less alone in this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow! I'm really sorry you had to endure all that, it must have been quite scary knowing you had the virus. At the same time it looks like you can't catch it twice (last news I've heard but I have no source) so at least you know 1) you can't catch it again 2) you're not contagious anymore (if you took a test and it came out negative). I'm still on edge to see if I'll catch it so I still wear a mask, and the gloves are good too. After a day of work I still use sanitiser on my hands (and burns like hell) because I feel a little paranoid, and I see they're a bit damaged by the constant washing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've taken antidepressants on and off since I was 14 (I'm now 20) so yeah I get the mental struggles and the idea of feeling trapped and feeling like the world was ending has been really scary for a while. The lockdown has caused all sorts of mental issues for many many many people, and economical issues of a never seen before size. But if they did it, I think they had their reasons. After all I don't feel like being responsible for endangering vulnerable people by acting recklessly duri g the virus.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-04 21:16:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is quite a light hearted post compared to the ones that are relevant right now but I feel like this is something worth talking about. I am over 18 and on Reddit I have no issues with seeing NSFW content when it's tagged, I don't mind reading articles or posts on adult matters. What I take issue with is gore, I can't stand it. It hurts me, I physically feel sick when I see other people suffering, and I think most people can agree with me. So why can't Reddit separate the two tags? There's a big difference between some sexy pic and GORE. Why did Reddit not do this already?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You sound very out of touch. Nobody on the internet owes you anything, even if they were long term friends. People might ghost for plenty of reasons including for their own mental health, for getting away from a toxic environment, or because something bad happened to them. Or they could just do it because they can, no explanation needed. Now, you're acting ridiculous because this is a person you talked to ONE time (!!!) And you seem quite naive because you said you shared pictures of you and your friends with them and personal things about yourself. You don't see how dangerous that could be? Sending private information around?? Are you even old enough to be here? You need to really look into internet safety and how to behave on social media otherwise you might make some mistakes you can't take back. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Applying creams before bed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-18 21:39:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I was wondering if any of you guys have some advice on how to deal with clothes and bedding when wearing creams, moisturisers and similar. I've just started a new cortisone ointment (very greasy) regimen and I want it to work, but I apply it before sleep and I feel like most product is getting absorbed into the bedding. What time do you usually wear moisturiser and cortisone? Any advice? I can be standing up in bed for a while but after that I need to get down and I have the ointment on both sides of my body so I can't avoid it touching the bed. If I wore the product during the day it would make my clothes greasy and I really wouldn't like it. What do you usually do?</TEXT>

Doctors want you to believe that you need to look a certain way to be beautiful but the reality is that most people don't care about such small things... Nobody would even notice!

    <TEXT>A couple years ago I had eczema on my head that made me wash my hair everyday because of infection and scabs falling out all the time, it lasted for months until I got prescribed Nizoral shampoo and Betacap Scalp Application. A couple months of that and I've been clear ever since from any eczema on my scalp. If I feel itchy I just use Nizoral a couple times and I'm fine. A game changer for me!</TEXT>

I followed this advice in particular because it made a lot of sense and I realised that if I added cheese on lobster it would completely cover the delicate taste of fish and ruin a 30 #163; dish. I understand your point though, especially in this period when there are hundreds of new rules to follow to ensure our own safety.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, first of all I recommend you to ask your doctor if it's the right thing for you. I got it prescribed for eczema flare ups on my scalp. It's a scalp application that contains corticosteroids and it smells like benzine (I don't know how else to describe it). It really helped me stop scratching and relieve the pain in my scalp. I also used Nizoral shampoo with it which is an antifungal and helped avoid infections. I hope this was a bit helpful and I wish you the best on your healing journey!</TEXT>
