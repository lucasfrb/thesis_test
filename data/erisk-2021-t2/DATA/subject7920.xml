    <TITLE>Art that isn't meant to be separated from the artists</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-14 21:05:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>One of the things I see a lot here, and on any subreddit about art or media, is the discussion about separating art from the artist. I've read two posts about it here in the last week alone but one thing no one ever talks about is art which is directly tied to their negative attributes. Lou Reed, for example, came up in a ton of discussions. Maybe you can ignore his treatment of women when you're rocking out to Sweet Jane but Berlin pushes it right in your face. I read an interview once with his ex-girlfriend where she said that certain songs from that album are basically autobiographal of their abusive relationship. There are a ton of examples like this. Bowie talks about himself using Ashes to Ashes and The Thin White Duke is basically the personification of his cocaine fueled evils. Maybe you have other examples of confessional music or music that leans into problematic aspects of the musician. I'd love to hear them and any thoughts you have on the topic. I just thought its an interesting counterpoint to the whole "separating art from the artist" debate.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I don't get the worship of Brain Wilson</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-28 06:29:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was reading a thread recently, it might have even been on this sub, about Surf's Up from the Smile Sessions. One anecdote that was retold about how when Brain Wilson played it for people, they said it was a gift from God. Another story is that when he finally listened it, Elvis Costello said it was like finding a lost Beethoven symphony. So naturally I listened to the song and it was...fine. I've had this experience before with Pet Sounds. I listened to it all the way through, expecting the greatest album of all time (which might not be the best mindest going into an album) and I just didn't get it. Wouldn't It Be Nice is classic, God Only Knows is great and I like Sloop John B. But other than that, I just found myself forcing my way through a bunch of innocuous, albeit well constructed, sounds. I eventually ended up giving up and recording Forever Changes over it. I don't know if other people have had this or if its just me. I'll admit that my taste in music skews a bit harder but I listen to oldies, to soft rock and folk and would like to think that I'll like anything which is good. I even love Beethoven, Bach, Satie and all those great classical composers Brian Wilson gets compared to. I just don't get it. I know he revoluntized recording and that troubled geniuses are always fascinating it's just that I find the most of his music totally inoffensive and boring. I prefer an interesting three chord song to a magnum opus of complex melodies and music theory which just leaves me unaffected. I dont know. Maybe there's something I'm missing. I just keep hearing these insane stories about how he's the greatest composer of our time and then the music leaves me cold.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I tried to explain that my taste skewing harder might be a factor but even I don't know why I like or don't like certain things. The thing is that I love the Beach Boy's early stuff, I love Kokomo and I love the uber-famous songs from the teenaged symphony era. So I don't think hard or soft is the main reason why Pet Sounds the Smile Sessions generally leaves me unaffected. You're right about The Kinks though. They are awesome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact of the matter is that abolition was not the result of a peaceful political movement. It was the result of the single bloodiest war in American history. Abolition does not occur without that. Southern states would not concede to a political movement. Killing people is always a horrendous act but killing people in order to bring about a change in government or society is how every single war and revolution operates. I don't know where you get the idea that he was using abolition as an excuse to murder with impunity but I've never encountered that perspective anywhere else. People may think he's crazy, misguided or radical but every source agrees he truly believed in and dedicated himself to abolition. Fredrick Douglas even said that "his zeal for the cause of my race was greater than my own." The nation was inevitably heading towards a bloody break and the bloodshed of a potential insurrection pales in comparison the the Civil War. If no revolution had followed, those who fought at Lexington and Concord would be viewed as terrorists and murders. Say John Brown was crazy and can't argue against an opinion. But saying that he had no support and cared only about fear mongering is incorrect. To say that peaceful abolition was a valid political movement ignores the state of the country in 1859. Maybe John Brown was just ahead of the curve. "I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think vainly, flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What was the advantage of forcing states to allow slavery in the early 19th century?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-29 05:06:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>In school, it was always taught that the southern states would not allow new states in unless the balance between slave and free states was maintained. On the surface this makes sense because it gives them an even split in Congress. But in doing this, it seemed like they were forcing states which did not want slavery to legalize it. My question is how that helps with their representation in Congress. Even if the state was only a slave state due to a compromise such as the Missouri Compromise, the people wouldn't support it and their representatives wouldn't help the southern senators. In addition, I was wondering what would've happened if a slave state decided to become free. Would that cause a crisis and require a new compromise?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Allusions in music compsition</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-08 22:54:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Its normal for song lyrics to alludes to another work. Bob Dylan sings about Ahab, Lou Reed sings about Romeo and Juliet, etc. Artist also self reference, like Glass Onion or Ashes to Ashes. But one thing I've been thinking about is allusion within the music itself. That's much rarer and harder to pull off. Off the top of my head, I can only think of Destroyer by the Kinks or Rape Me by Nirvana, which is the chords of Smells like Teen Spirit but reversed. Its harder to pull of, in my opinion, because while repeating a lyric is a quote, repeating a riff is plagiarism. I was wondering why you think that is, what separates the good attempts from the misfires and why an artist might do something like that. (Full disclosure, I wrote two songs which try this and that's what got me thinking about it)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing you always hear is how hard it is for musicians to get recognized, get signed or get any modicum of success. Even the most talented, amazing artists can struggle for years until they get a chance. So how how do artists that are strange and without wide appeal get into the music business? I know that Captain Beefheart was friends with Frank Zappa but otherwise I don't know how it'd happen. No matter how much I love Tom Waits, it seems crazy that he got a chance to prove himself while so many more popular artists struggled for attention. Are there just producers who love idiosyncratic, esoteric and odd music? Did they work hard and get lucky like everyone else?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me, I'd have to say surf rock. Most of the great songs were one hit wonders and the artists who made it popular either faded out of the limelight or pivoted like the Beach Boys did. Yet you hear a ton of surf rock is other genres. The use of Middle Eastern music from people like Dick Dale seems to bleed into later ska. Once you add distortion and other sound effects that make it sound more "hard", surf rock can sound a lot like metal. And most notably, it influenced early east coast punk. Look no further than Sheena is a Punk Rocker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was having a conversation about some of best album covers recently and it got me thinking about cover art, designs and photos. Being born after the age of hardcopy, I've never bought an actual album unless I knew the band and wanted to hang it up in my room. But have any of you ever bought an album based entirely on the cover? Did that introduce you to a band you loved or did it turn out they wrre better at striking omages than music? And, going back to the question which me and my friend were discussing, is cover art as important anymore? It can add to the album but its not in your face now that most people use streaming or other interested based music options. Even if it still has importance, I think its role has diminished.</TEXT>

I don't think a book has ever changed my life, I've never wanted to thank a book and no book has ever "meant the world to me." Books have changed my perspective, made me feel and think and have shaped me as a person but in very smalls ways, usually building on other experiences I've had and other books I've read. I just tend to hate this kind of gushing in general and prefer more discussion as opposed to a clickbaity "When you read this book EVERYTHING WILL CHANGE."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are the Beatles actually anyone's favorite band?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-26 07:24:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>There's a Mark Twain quote that says " A classic is a book that everyone praises but no one actually reads." I understand that the Beatles might be the favorite band of many people who were alive in the 60s but it seems that a ton of the people who call them the greatest band of all time don't actually listen to their music. My cousin, for example, will argue for hours when I bring up the tiniest criticism about The Beatles or if I say another band is better. But then if you check his playlist, he has about three Beatles songs out of about a thousand liked songs. I'm not saying the Beatles don't deserve the praise but I just find it interesting that people who don't like listening to them still hold them in such high esteem. It seems odd that if you ask someone who the greatest band of all time is, they'll give the name of a band they don't listen to or have a particular fondness for. Have they just become ubiquitous as "the greatest band ever"? Can people with more modern tastes discern that their music is good, even if they can't appreciate it for themselves? It seems like a Mozart or Beethoven type thing where pretty much no one jams to them but they're respected and revered.</TEXT>

A lot of the extra details I hear are superfluous and detract from the song, although maybe I'm just used to the previous version. Some songs are mixed in ways which only come through on headphones, like music in one ear and voice coming through the other. Like I said, its good for some songs but distracts from others. Many lose their minimalist charm. Some songs don't benefit from lush production or lots of background details.

On a more objective note, I also think that Forever Changes is the best album of the 60s (I say objectively because its the best in my opinion, not just my favorite), Hurricane is the most overrated Dylan song and Jim Croce had the most wasted potential of any rock and roll plane crash. So with that out of the way, what are your weird, unpopular, hard to explain music opinions?

    <TEXT>I have the songs composed and written but all I have to record is my guitar, keyboard, drum, phone and computer. I'm not too worried about sounding professional, as this is basically going to be a demo album and I think that the low fi is part of the appeal.

I'm just wondering where to start, what order to do things, how I need to do things and how to put it all together. Most songs are just me and guitar, although I sing better when I'm not playing and would prefer to record the two things separately. It gets more complicated with my multi-instrument songs. Most are two guitars and drums, with the second guitar acting as bass and recording those is a daunting task. I'm fine with my music having amateurish charm but at the end of the day I want stark, clear instrumentation, understandable vocals and I want it to sound good. Any advice is appreciated!</TEXT>

I'm just wondering where to start, what order to do things, how I need to do things and how to put it all together. Most songs are just me and guitar, although I sing better when I'm not playing and would prefer to record the two things separately. It gets more complicated with my multi-instrument songs. Most are two guitars and drums, with the second guitar acting as bass and recording those is a daunting task. I'm fine with my music having amateurish charm but at the end of the day I want stark, clear instrumentation, understandable vocals and I want it to sound good. Any advice is appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Who is the best composer of the second half of the twentieth century?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 04:15:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love classical music but I know that it can get complicated when you talk about more recent artists in the same breath as other composers. That being said, I don't see why modern artists should be precluded from the type of criticism and conversation that Mozart and Beethoven receive. Other than form and the method of release, its all instrumental music and should be considered equally. As for my choice, it would either be Zappa, Davis or John Williams. Hot Rats was the album that got me thinking about this topic, Davis is on such a high level and John Williams uses his scores just as well as operatic composers use their music.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What was the folk scene's reaction to Bob Dylan going electric?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-27 07:34:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know that literally everyone with a decent knowledge of Bob Dylan knows this but everything I've ever heard about it comes from the perspective of Bob Dylan dealing with their reaction. I want to know about the scene itself. I'd like a more in depth answer than " they felt betrayed and didn't like it." As he was writing Positively Fourth Street, did they write any songs against him? Why was going electric SO taboo for them and was it actually about that or about the fact he was turning away from protest songs and towards more personal themes? What sort of treatment exactly elicited the venom of Positively Fourth Street? I find music scenes fascinating and one thing I dont like is how most of the time, they're only ever shown as the background for the artist they propelled and ignored once that artists leave it, just as a setting for their story. Hopefully you all can give me some answers because this topic has really been interesting me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are the most interesting things that were reconned by the prequels?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-29 05:27:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I remember looking at old star wars comics which showed a young Kenobi where instead of Jedi robes, he's wearing a sleek black jumpsuit. In light of the common compliant that obi wan hid out in Jedi robes, I though that was pretty interesting. It also showed him looking much more like Alec Guinness in terms of age which also makes him older during New Hope and explains why Tarkin thought be was dead. I almost preferred this version to the prequel version, at least as a contrast. I know there was sort of an embargo on telling stories in the prequel era but a ton of stuff about was implied. The clone wars originally had the clones as the bad guys for example. I used to think that Jedi lived longer because Yoda was 900, as opposed to it being related to his species. This sort of was implied by Dooku and Jinn being able to augment their bodies and fight in their advanced age but in general was refuted. So I was wondering what alternative routes Star Wars could've gone, what implications turned out to false and what headcanons you held?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Missing Link" influences</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 20:57:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was looking at Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize acceptance speech awhile back and one section in particular stood out to me. He basically goes through a few of his songs which were groundbreaking or revolutionary and says that those songs are just the natural result of a kid who grew up listening to this and that song. For example, (although this particular song wasn't isn't the speech) Subterranean Homesick Blues was inspired by Too Much Monkey Business. And I was just wondering how many other songs which "invented" something were just the result of clear but more obscure influences. The other example I can think of off the top of my head is that Punk rock comes from a combination of old school rock and surf rock and surf rock from from middle eastern music. Miserlou is just an old Arabic folk song after all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why the heck was Obi Wan sent to Utapau to kill Grievous?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 07:26:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now I know that in the Revenge of the Sith novelization, there's a scene where Mace gives him the assignment and says that since he's THE master of Soresu, he's the absolute best choice to face Grievous. This makes sense in the context of the movies and novelization, but the logic falls apart as soon as you take either clone wars series into account. First off, the CGI Clone Wars. I was watching "Grievous Intrigue" from season two and I was surprised to see that Obi Wan and Grievous fought before Revenge of the Sith. Now Obi Wan holds his own against Grievous and his guards but he doesn't really overpower him or show himself to be Grievous's "perfect match." Not only is the fight pretty balanced, but Grievous only uses two arms for most of it and easily manages to escape. This is Grievous's main strategy in a fight, either overwhelm his opponent or run away, and he does it pretty well. He's done it to Obi Wan in the past, even though he was on Obi Wan's ship which was full of his troopers. So why did they think Obi Wan would be able to stop him from escaping like always, especially when he hadn't in the past? The biggest take away from rewatching the Grievous episodes is that Obi Wan isn't the best pick to fight Grievous. He stands his ground which is impressive but he's not amazing against him. You know who is? Kit Fitso. He utterly humiliates Grievous. He's never even scared and is smiling the whole time when he duels him. Soresu is defensive and precise which is good for opposing Grievous but Fitso's form 1 Shii Chi style is much better because it was literally meant to fight multiple opponents ei, multiple lightsabers. Sure, he didn't kill Grievous that day but he disarmed him and had him on the ropes. That counts for something. The hand drawn Clone Wars series brings up another issue. Now, this is no longer canon but at the time Revenge if the Sith was released, it was and it even acted as a prelude to the movie. In it Grievous faces off against six Jedi, including two masters. He duels Mundi and Shak Ti at the same time and Mundi is at least close to the skill level of Obi Wan. So my question becomes: why did they send Obi Wan alone? There's no advantage to him fighting alone, especially since he didn't use the element of surprise. Grievous is literally the only Sepratist leader left and he's the most wanted man in the galaxy,. The Jedi council thinks he's a monster and wants him destroyed. Why wouldn't they send more Jedi? I know their forces were stretched thin and Anakin couldn't go but they had people to spare. Kit Fitso, who'd more than held him own against Grievous in the past, was at the Jedi temple, along with the two other masters Mace took to arrest Palpatine (Who were great warriors, just not near Palpatines level.) Heck, Schr #246;dinger's Jedi, Shak Ti, was maybe kinda probably alive and in the Jedi temple at that time and had faced Grievous three times. So why not bring multiple Jedi, especially when Grievous always cheated and used his electro staff guards? I know that the Star Wars movies and series mess with each other in weird ways (Anakin not being able to meet Grievous in The Clone Wars, "My powers have doubled since we last meet." When they double, in the span of like two weeks?) But it just seems weird to me. Of course, it worked and Obi Wan is awesome but if anyone has a response to this, I'd love to hear it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are your biggest musical "What Ifs"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 07:46:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Mine would have to be what if Buddy Holly lived? He was already getting more experimental and had a head start on The Beatles, who he was a huge influence on. I think its possible he would've taken Rock and Pop in totally different directions, or at least brought certain things to us earlier. There might not even had been a British Invasion if he were around. My second choice would be what if Jim Croce had lived, since his career was incredibly short and he could've ended up on the level of Bob Dylan or John Prine. He's mostly known for his "Tough guy in Chicago gets surprisingly beat up" songs which is a shame. You Don't Mess Around with Jim and Bad Bad Leroy Brown are great, but Operator and a ton of his deeper cuts blow them out of the water. Obviously a lot of these are going to be about people who died young but I'm sure there are other interesting ones. So tell me about your speculation, your alternate timelines and events which are more influential than you'd suspect.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-25 07:52:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I'm 20 years old, I've been writing songs for awhile and during quarantine, I've been trying to record them. My current set up involves recording the guitar track with my phone, putting it into my bootleg garage band, recording the vocals with my phone using headphones so the instrumental doesn't pick up, and combining them. I think that lyrics are my greatest strength so hopefully production quality isn't a giant factor but I'm wondering how much it matters to other people. Namely, I'm wondering what my audience would think (if I had one) and what anyone in the industry would think if I sent them as demos. My songs are on soundcloud now, at least the ones that I've recorded, but I'm willing to rerecord them and wondering what is expected from these kind of recordings</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I'm a 20 year old college student who has been writing music in my dorm and decided to record some of it while in quarantine. I've been putting it on soundcloud so I can send it around and have been promoting it on reddit to see what people think. It runs the gamut between folk, punk, rockabilly and anything else that interests me but I only have an acoustic guitar and a paint drum so there's not too much I can do. Anyway, any feedback on any songs would be awesome, and thanks to anyone who listens. https://m.soundcloud.com/user-180984760</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Without The Beatles, does the British invasion still happen?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 00:10:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are a lot of shifts in music that, no matter how revolutionary, were "inevitable." The big one that people bring up is Elvis. He's a unique and iconic artist but if he wasn't there, some other charismatic white guy would've brought rock and roll to the masses. Producers were looking for one. In my opinion, the British Invasion falls in the same category. Elvis went to the army and started making musicals, Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens were dead and the music scene was saturated with "nothing but Bobbys", in the words of Jerry Lee Lewis. But in England, rock and roll was still alive, inspired by America. And The Beatles weren't the only band playing American rock, roll and blues. They weren't even the first, they were just the most famous. The Yardbirds, The Kinks, The Who and other bands already existed in some form. So my question is whether the British Invasion have happened without the Beatles? Who would've led it and what shape would music have taken?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How did gangsta rap come to be and what direction would rap have gone in with our it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-10 03:39:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>One thing I've always heard is that gangsta rap and the gangsta image were manufactured. The only real criminal in NWA was Easy-E and Ice Cube has gone on record as saying he wrote what sold records. A lot of early gangsta rappers seem more like they're inhabiting personas and acting "hard" because that's expected. Of course, numerous rappers who came later were actually true gangsters but I'm talking about the inception. Was the genre really created or did it come naturally and did it derail more politically and socially aware groups like Public Enemy. I mean, years after you have Chuck D saying that a man should be a father and never tell a woman be can't bother, Ice Cube was taking about avoiding fatherhood on "Can't Fade Me." Plus, the influence of people like Suge Night is anything but beneficial towards the art of rap. So did gangsta rap hurt rap and force many more artistic artist (like Tupac) to adopt a lifestyle and image which they wouldnt have otherwise?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If we're allowed to ressurect dead members, The Clash. Mick Jones's penchant for samples and idosyncric production has become a staple of music as hip hop and rap become more popular and if there's one thing we need in this era, it's a 10/10 punk album. Of course, they could end up making an album which focuses more on music and less on social issues, but I doubt it. Even Combat Rock, which has a reputation as a rock radio, sellout album, is incredibly political. Its just that people listened to Should I Stay Or Should I Go more than Ghetto Defendant. Plus, the X-factor is Joe Strummer. He was in the middle of a comeback and was recording his best solo album when died. I wonder what he'd say about the state of the world right now, being the socially active guy he was. Honestly, the album would be the cherry on top. I just want Joe Strummer back for a bit. If we're not allowed to bring the dead back (which is lame), I'd pick Bob Dylan, Neil Young, or Public Ememy. Colorado and Rough and Rowdy Ways were good but they lacked the vitality and urgency of their earlier works. If they could match their peaks and even surpass them, that'd be amazing. As for Public Enemy, they always seemed like the smartest rap group, with the best perspective and the most socially active lyrics. Plus the stuff that the Bomb Squad was doing sonically was ahead of its time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I know what you mean. I mainly write lyrics but as I've gotten better at guitar, I've been doing arrangements as well. I can't even play some of my songs by myself and I know if I ever tried them live, I'd probably make a mistake or two. Covering songs around the campfire is one thing but sucking sucks a lot more when you're playing songs that are near to your heart and that you've worked really hard on. I think that when stuff opens up with covid, I'm going to try open mics, just to workshop and get feedback, because getting feedback from anonymous strangers on the internet isn't ideal and getting my friends to listen to my songs is like pulling teeth. But I do understand what you mean. I'm not much of a performer, but I love making music.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I started out writing songs, I didn't even know how to play an instrument and I just wrote lyrics, which is still the main focus of my songwriting. I do have full "songs" now, with arrangements and everything, but I've been playing guitar for a year and a half so they skew simple. In quarantine, I started to record them, but that's where I've been having the most trouble. I listen to some of the people working out of their bedrooms and it sound so professional and intricate and I'm wondering how they manage it. I'm working with an old guitar, a paint drum and no budget, but I'm still trying to sound as good as I can. It doesn't help that I want to make rock, but lack a band, an electric guitar or anything of the things that I was influenced by. So I was just wondering what advice, tricks, methods or thoughts you had.</TEXT>

I was thinking of adding a slide guitar, but I'm not good enough at slide guitar yet, and I don't really have drums or a bass. But yeah, I agree that some flavor and complexity could be added to the sound. I write lyrics first, and being as new as I am to guitar, it can be hard to make my music as engaging.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-18 22:44:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Memories fermenting In the cellars of your mind You're a nostalgaholic Drink the past down like wine Indivisible But we're past our prime Though the clock runs in circles So there's always more time The more things stay the same, the more things change Not much say except ain't it strange The boy who cried wolf Grew up and had kids Now he warns, threatens Makes up wisdom and forbids Generations raised in threats Grown into apathy Boogey men complain A pound of flesh ain't worth what it used to be Even the strange news Makes sense in that it doesn't Things are as they were And it seems they never wasn't The dead rose from the grave And did their nine to five And groan and moaned it's so mundane Like they did when alive Origami stores folded While those with real jobs scolded Steady men within safe systems Said don't be frivolous like them The next day the plague came Half the town got laid off And it didn't seem so funny To jeer, to joke, to scoff All I know is that Fortune favors the lucky Hey don't ask me why, That the way it's gonna be The more things stay the same, the more things change Not much say except, hey ain't it strange The town crier's voice has gone hoarse But he only ever told us bad news of course To matter what they deal Ace and eights are up your sleeve He'd never want to stay In a place he couldn't leave He went to jump of the bridge But the line too was too long There's still grief in weakness So ya might as well be strong Mama warns of drama And trauma that the world has played But you smile cause you know that All the best pain is homemade Father Doolittle Tries to teach about sin Which never really stops it Just stirs shame within So we hold ourselves at gunpoint And make our best demands And even then, we disappoint Our own bluffing hands The more things stay the same, the more things change Not much say except hey, ain't it strange After work The old men with ashtray lungs Go to the bar And pretend that pretend they're still young We go cause we know in this town There's nothing to do Except to get together And look for something new She told me it's her favorite song Though she don't know the words But she hums it so beautifully While I strum the chords He sorts up his crushed innocence In a bathroom full of gloom While the bridesmaid sucks On the cold feet on the groom The more things stay the same, the more things change Not much say 'cept that it's strange They elect the wardens While the guards watch the polls And rain is the only thing That fills up the holes He found Jesus in prison And asked what are you in for Jesus said he was innocent But punishment's the cure He'd taken a whip Into some giant church That sold crucifixion souvenirs And resurrection merch When the poor said they were cold They light them on fire And dedicate a song to their souls From the choir It's clear why Jesus made more wine Knowing what he knew Sometimes it's just true #160; That water won't do The more things stay the same, the more things change Not much say except, hey ain't its strange I got the keys to the kingdom But I can't find the door So I've been circling the walls On a graffiti tour They ask for a through line To tie the scenes together To draw a morals from a stone To make them all feel better But things just happen in mosaic No one's far enough to see The picture all the pieces make And the place of you and me Synchronized stars shine and pirouette While the sun burns like God's cigarette #160; And I see that I shouldn't regret Cause all my best mistakes are ahead of me yet The more things stay the same, the more things change Not much say except ain't it strange</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[https://soundcloud.com/thegreatbrendini/incoherent-demo](https://soundcloud.com/thegreatbrendini/incoherent-demo) I know the mix is rough, because this is literally the first time I mixed a track with multiple instruments and parts instead of just guitar and voice, but this is a folk punk song about my speech impediment. I think it's one of my better songs, but I guess that's up to you.

    <TEXT>I kept waiting for the song to really pick up and it was worth it when it did, although maybe the intro wears out its welcome a bit. I really like the electronic elements and the melodies they make, though the drum sound doesn't really fit in my opinion. It's a bit harsh for the track. Maybe you could make it less prominent in the mix, but other than that, I really like it. And besides, I don't know much about drums anyway.</TEXT>

As for the rest of the track, I think your vocals could be mixed differently. I'm not saying you have a bad voice, just that it could use some effects of a subdued mix so that it fits with the mood. Also, when you do a crescendo with it, it'll be more prominent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say the Clash. They both had a seven year history (depending on your definition of The Clash) and evolved consistently throughout that span. Sandistina is a world away from their first album and if you count all their double and triple albums as two or three, you end up with 8 releases in the span of seven years, not counting countless bootlegs. While they might not be totally consistent, they definitely are far above the output of the average band and I'm more than willing to forgive their misses in the name of experimentation. You got the songwriting duo of Strummer and Jones to go up against Lennon and McCartney. You got the post breakup collaborations but no cash in reunions. Most importantly, you have an awesome band. If you reversed which one had a "mania" and which one was associated with the dangerous underground movement of punk, one might be more popular than the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the Clash so much. Joe Strummer is the closet thing I have to a musical hero and London Calling is my favorite album of all time. Every time I listen to it, my favorite song changes and ever since I started to play guitar, I've been trying to learn every song off it. They started out as one of the first punk bands and then took punk to place it'd never been, despite the regressive punks who mistook experimentation for selling out. And speaking of experimentation, the Clash played Punk, Ska, Reggae, Rockabilly, Soul, Polka, Rap, New Wave, Funk, Dub, New Wave, Jazz and more. Mick Jones is one of the best songwriters ever and Joe Strummer is up there as well, though he was more of a lyricist and moral force for the group. Topper Headon is a human drum machine and Paul Simonon went from not knowing how to play bass to writing the bassline to Guns of Brixton. They titled an album "Sandinista" while Reagan was funding the Contras and sold it for the cost of a single album, even though it was a triple album. And how did they do it? They took a paycut. Not only is their music great but they epitomized what punk should be. They epitomize what musicians should be. Of course, they weren't perfect and would implode, but during their run, they wrote the blueprint for a punk band (At least a punk band that didn't implode after one or two albums). And now my cousins only know them because Should I Stay or Should I Go was in Stranger Things. I'm going to have to do something about that when the're old enough. But until then, I'm going to listen to Ghetto Defendant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'll write a song and think the lyrics are good. Then I'll come up with an arrangement I like and record everything as well as I can. The song will be in a genre I like and throughout the entire process, I'm pretty satisfied with it. But then after I post it on soundcloud, I can't listen to it. My friends played one of my songs in the car today and I got noticably uncomfortable. Is this something most people deal with? I'm pretty sure its not indicative of my quality of music but I'm not sure. All the mistakes that no one else notices are the only thing i hear and I just cringe at myself. Any thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think your definition of punk is way too narrow. If you look at the themes and topics they're discussing, it's within a doubt a punk album. In addition, you have to remember that when The Clash was starting out, Gang of Four (punk), Television (Art-Jazz Rock) and Blondie (New wave, pop?) were considered punk. It was much more malleable back then</TEXT>

And again, I don't consider punk a sound, I'm more thinking of the themes, lyrics, etc. If the Clash had just kept making songs that sounded the same forever in order to placate people who defined that as "punk," that would be the exact opposite of punk. Doing your own thing no matter what other people think and challenging preconceptions of genre is much more in line with that ethos.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Forever Changes by Love is as good as or better than Pet Sounds and Sgt Peppers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-08 05:27:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since everyone is doing these kinds of post, I'd thought I'd add one to the discuss, both because I believe it and because I think piling on is funny. But I've always thought Forever Changes was one of the most underrated albums of all time. It's psychedelic yet seems rebuke the hippie movements, it's romantic yet cynical, baroque yet with forward thinking production. It took me until this year to realize that it's the oldest album I've ever heard with a sample in it, and that's after listening to it as much as I'd let myself. I don't listen to it all the time because I know I'd get tired of it if I turned it on every time I'm tempted. But when it is playing, it's the only album I can get all the way through without skips. The tracklisting is absolutely perfect and it leads to You Set The Scene, which in my opinion, can stand up to A Day in the Life or Wouldn't it Be Nice. Not only is it groundbreaking, affecting, resonant and beautiful, it's near flawless. I'm having trouble describing how awesome it is but instead of reading my scattershot attempt to pay every compliment I can, you should just listen to the album. It justifies and explains itself.</TEXT>

The same way that "world music" contains totally different music from many different countries and "Classical Music" is usually used to describe music from the Baroque, Classical and Romantic music, Classic Rock is used to describe a ton of things which may or may not even be rock.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What artists or groups "changed" but produced great music both before and after they did? [List]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 07:19:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>One of my favorite artists is Jonathan Richman and one of the strangest things about his career is how his music changed of the years. When he was young, he pioneered a Velvet Underground influenced proto-punk, with songs like Pablo Picasso and She Cracked. Then he turned to an almost Doo-Wop sound, traveling the country with only acoustic guitar and a drummer. You can like Roadrunner or When Harpo Played His Harp or you can like both. But they're very different kinds of music. I'm wondering what other artists went through drastic shifts but were just as good before and after? Maybe they sold out, changed scenes or just tried something new. But I think its an interesting idea, considering how often "changing" is viewed as a bad thing by fans.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-16 16:35:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my time on this sub and every other music discussion forum, I've had it explained to me that Tom Waits isn't avant garde, Zappa isn't experimental and any relatively strange or unique song is only weird from a popular music perspective. It seems almost like a game of one-upsmanship, in a similar vein of "Who's the greatest guitarist." As soon as you say Hendrix, there's someone just aching to swoop in and mention some obscure classical guitarist who plays the exact right Hertz for every note. So if all the bizarre, eclectic music I like is actually tame, what actually constitutes revolutionary, outside the box music? What can you recommend or discuss with me that is actually avant garde, experimental and strange?</TEXT>

I don't think anyone considers it a good song or a valuable piece of music but its catchy and people, from political commentators to the people you hang out with, like to talk about it.

    <TEXT>This is a relatively dumb hypothetical scenario that I thought of but its fun to think of nonetheless. Lets say that in 1985, after recording We Are The World, all the artists decided to stick together and put out a full, real album of original material. It'd be the biggest supergroup of all time, with a spectrum of artists which extended from Michael Jackson to Bob Dylan. Its totally unrealistic but that's sort of what hpyotheticals are for. Would Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder duet? Would Bob Dylan and Paul Simon write lyrics for Quincy Jones's music? Would there be enough drugs to go around?</TEXT>

Give me an honest man Give me something anything To help me, understand  #8203; Some say words will change the world And words sure can do a lot But words are just what you exhale When words are all you got Those with power entertain and sing Speak the nicest words and never say a thing They empower us with flattery But there's no power in complacency Some put all stock on feeling And put all blame on pain No matter what you feel about it It matters just the same Chemical happiness makes them ignore What drives them crazy like it's the cure But they're still a reason that some can't elude When you change accurate mood Some define themselves by meanings That they themselves made Corral infinity with paper Money, deeds and grades School didn't teach me wisdom But it got me taut Talking bout stressed out Over all the debt we bought A million reasons to feel better A million reasons to feel pain Just choose what you focus on As time circles down the drain What will be my scapegoat To stop me from thinking much As I walk down the street Every traveler has a crutch I just have my hope that Soon they'll be within my sight I just look for one honest thing In this city by lamplight  #8203; They say it's all a journey But who wants to be lost And when you're in the wrong direction Each step takes a cost Should I dare impose myself When I may be wrong If I am unsure, should I Go along But youth was made for error And age for regret Soon we'll all know everything But then they'll be nothing left No wisdom teaches better Than the regret from ignoring it As you walk through the streets Wandering ain't curing it The only thing that makes us learn Is finality But by then it's too late The lesson's moot you see And I'm not afraid of the pain Or of what life can dole out I'm afraid that I might change That in weakness I might doubt Those with soul have no experience And those with power have no innocence They always ask what you'd tell a younger you That you didn't know yet But I'd rather have the younger me Tell me something he'll forget But a million different streets erupt Every which way but here Guiding me away, I'll find No salvation, I fear I'd search until my feet were broken But I see how I have been searching everywhere Going in circles now But I haven't found nothing None of it seems right I'm just searching for one true thing In this city by lamplight  #8203; I got nothing left to say I got nowhere left to go I didn't when I first went out But now I really know That as I keep putting fate off Wasting time becomes my fate The most common form of suicide In the world is just to wait So I turn to my dark room As doom and gloom hang low So I return to my dark room Where I fester from old blows But still restless, I go back to The bathroom and the mirror Tonight I found no honest men But for once it caused no fear As I stare at my reflection I can finally see If I'm gonna find an honest man It'll have to be me</TEXT>

I mean, come on, that guy who reacted the murder was spot on. Also, how vulnerable are supes? Because I remember in the first season, killing any supe was seen as an impossible task that required insane cleverness. I understand that some probably aren't invulnerable or even bulletproof but it sure seemed like Lamplighter, a former member of The Seven, could be taken out with a handgun.</TEXT>

If anyone was meant to fight Palpatine, it was Like and seeing a full power, grandmaster Luke fight Palpatine once and for would've been amazing. He wouldn't even have to use the dark side or murder him. He'd be powerful enough to beat him pretty easily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, Operation Cinder, whatever you think of it, made some sense when it came out. Palpatine is wholy focused on himself so he'd want to punish those who failed him. Plus, the idea that any Empire could not defend him didn't deserve to exist is at least interesting. But why would he destroy the empire if he was still alive? Why destroy everything he's every built if you're still alive and trying to retake power? Next, we have Luke. It took him 17 years to begin training Jedi. I understand he wanted to seek out knowledge and become a better Jedi before he started, but fine. My main problem is that, in nearly a decade of teaching, he didn't train one Jedi to the rank of knight. In the entire time period from Return of the Jedi to Force Awakens, he's the only real Jedi. I just wish they actually did something for the era between trilogies instead of acting like a kid who's homework is due next period.</TEXT>

I love both albums and both have amazing, groundbreaking songs, but I think that Bringing It All Back Home is more of a continuation or culmination of Bob Dylan's folk period, with an inkling of what was to come. Highway 61, however, changed the game of rock and finally combined folk and rock and roll, for better or worse. Multiple artists, from Springsteen to Zappa, cite Like a Rolling Stone as one of the most significant and impactful rock songs to ever be released. Its a nitpick but I think the difference between Bringing It Back Home and Highway 61 is the difference between a great album and a world changing album.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rock the Casbah is pretty punk in terms of subject matter. Its about rebelling against theocracies who ban music. And while a lot of people like to define punk in narrow terms of sound, I think that ultimately hurts the genre. It should be about what you're saying and sounding however you want, no matter what people think. Also, if we're going to say that Train in Vain isn't punk, then neither are 90% of the Buzzcocks songs. Neither are any punk songs about romance or daily woes. Punk is a hard thing to quantify and I think if you try to, you lessen the possibilies of what it can be and what it can do.</TEXT>

That being said, I hate, hate, HATE the Billy Joel song Angry Young Man. The whole song is about how you shouldn't believe in anything, have ideals or fight any battles. Its a song that gets categorized as rock that's about conforming, being passive towards the problems of the world and making fun of people who are having problems with their lives. I'd hoped that it was tongue and cheek but upon looking it up, I found out it was inspired by an actual Vietnam vet who couldn't readapt to society. Its the closest thing I could find to an antipunk song, it has a terrible message and I HATE it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, the fascists and communists were bitter rivals. The moderate establishment party, led by Hidenberg, preferred the fascists to the communists and tried to unite with them to office the communists elements. That's why Hidenberg appointed Hitler to the role of Chancellor and why the fascists eventually took power. Its possible my history could be wrong but if the sources I've read and are heard are correct, that's the actual story</TEXT>

    <TEXT>White Light/White Heat has always seemed like a weird album to rank to me because it has less songs than any other. Someone once told me that the difference between an album or an EP or LP is that an album has at least 7 songs. Of course, I don't really agree with that because it discounts most prog albums but still, I makes for a difficult comparison. If we're talking about the album with the best songs, I'd say the banana album. If we're talking about the most coherent and singular work, is say White Light/White Heat. And if we're talking about the album with the most good or great songs, I'd say Loaded.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, I never said I agreed with that idea. But it is harder to rank an album with 6 songs than an album with 10</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've never posted any of my music here but I thought I would finally try it. This is a demo I recorded in my living room. It's about my speech impediment and I recorded it with my phone, an acoustic guitar and a paint drum.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Thanks man! A paint drum is what happens when you have zero budget so you take a paint barrel you buy at Home Depot and bang on it instead.</TEXT>
