    <TEXT>I realise it looks as if im self promoting, as pointed out kindly by someone in the comments, but im honestly not, this is my uncles channel and i rly like his stuff. Ive posted a comment saying 'I didn't make this Reddit!' on his 'My first Table Top Terrain miniature house build ... go easy on me ;)' video if that helps? but i realise that there's no way for me to definitively prove it. I think it would b a lot worse if I promoted someone elses content as my own, but let me know in the comments below what I need to know about posting other peoples content and im all ears</TEXT>

However, I DID NOT MAKE THIS AND THIS IS NOT MY YT CHANNEL, i rly dont like it when people think im a liar, rly rubs me the wrong way, but i completely understand how it looked, and it did look bad;), so from now on ill b a bit more careful and post in the comments instead</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took this photo in Soho London because I liked the body position of the man centre frame as it seemed to me to bring a bit of a story to my photo. I also really like taking photos of alleyways and this was a particularly interesting one due to the cobbled pavement and rustic feel. I took the photo with leading lines of the buildings in mind so that there was a clear direction for the photo. Shutter Speed - gt; 1/160s F-stop - gt; 6.3 ISO - gt; 400 Any feedback would be appreciated, specifically how I could do the framing better or colour editing</TEXT>

I also liked the way the alleyway was really grubby and moody and then opens up onto a bright street at the end. F-stop - gt; 5.6 Shutter speed - gt; 1/60s ISO - gt; 400 PS, let me know if the motion blur/out of focus of the people adds to the photo or takes away, personally I quite like it, but I don't really trust my own opinion</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it was actually small enough that I could press the rocks against the surface of one of the large rocks and stack them that way before I wedged the stack into the other large rock. Towards the end both my arms were trying to hold the horizontal stack against the large rock without it all falling apart, which it did quite a few times! I also made sure I found all the right rocks before I started, flat and preferably slightly wedged shaped. Any more rocks and it would have collapsed</TEXT>

The thumbnails seem good as well, nice and catchy, however sometimes it seems to me that they r slightly unrelated to the video, but that's very minor.

    <TITLE>[Review Video] Stone carving video, which I did a lot of the filming for</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-30 17:56:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Rock carving video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO_jnjH1b1w) This is from my uncle's arts and crafts channel, not my own, however I did a lot of the filming (almost all the outdoor shots) for this particular video, and a lot of filming on his channel in general, so I hope that qualifies this as at least partly my own work. Self review: I am happy with most of the shots I did in this video, I tried to be as creative as possible with the shots I took. I think there is definitely room for improvement with the flow between the shots, so if anyone has any ideas about shot transitions then I would really like to hear them. Feel free to give other criticisms as well, and I will feed them back to my uncle.

    <TEXT>Wow! Thanks so much for taking the time to write such insightful feedback! I don't do professional camera work for a living, but I am very flattered. I would agree with your comment about the autofocus, I definitely aim to get better at using manual focus and I have already fed back to my uncle about the end card (I don't like it either), I think it was something he was just trying out and most of his other videos don't end like that. I really enjoy film work and your feedback has really encouraged me to do more. Thanks again!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the feedback, this is my second or third time trying to shoot B-roll (my uncle is an experienced editor and he edited these shots together really well I think), so I think it will get better over time, I also need to figure out how to use manual focus and definitely try to frame better. I will feedback the editing advice about colour grading and stabilization to my uncle</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My uncle initially used a carving knife to whittle out the main bits and then went in with a Dremel to smooth it out and add the finer details, such as the fingers, the toes and the face. Then he put a black wash over it and then finished with some grey paint dry brushing to add that weathered look. This Goblin Gargoyle is a piece that he is going to use in some upcoming DND games, along with all the other terrain pieces he has made.

    <TEXT>Glad u like it! My uncle makes lots of different projects like this on his YT channel, and for this build he has a tutorial [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3wVBa9ZkY amp;list=PL4XGLSW2UG_iWFeZgN0Jmgl9G7V1OuKdd). He has lots of other videos and tutorials on this sort of stuff as well, but if u want to search elsewhere for good tutorials there is a guy called 'Doug Linker' who has some good tutorials for whittling as well. The general process he went through for this build was initial sketches of the design, applying those sketches to a block of Basswood, doing some rough whittling with standard carving knives to get the body, then using a dremel to get the finer details, then painting and finally dry brushing to give it that textured look.</TEXT>
