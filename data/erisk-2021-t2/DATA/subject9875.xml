    <TITLE>Damon "Stealing" Elena?!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-20 10:36:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay So whenever I go through Youtube Videos of DE and SE(mostly). People Often comment that Damon stole Elena from Stefan. What are your opinions on this? They quote "he made moves on her"and all that scenarios in Season 3 basically accusing him of taking advantage in the absence of Stefan. While I think it was mutual from both sides. What are your opinions on this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I have heard about zalrb a lot,I ll check it out. That doppleganger thing is not my favourite too but she did it to make Delena look stronger and all and I was saying that this pretty much shut their relationship off for me.About Damon going to Bonnie and Elena to Stefan( I think you are referring to 6x21) thats the only scene w/ them as Elena knows Damon doesn't listen to her in these kind of things and when it comes to being with Elena. She basically just left him on hang in the end of 6x20.AFTER that they did talk about ut on the top of clock tower and on the porch. Elena talked about it to Stefan because he is his brother and she knew howmuch he meant to him and stefan was not happy about his brother taking the cure.If I would have to see SE, i would have love to see them from s5 ep 18 realising that their relationship didn't end and they can work out onwards but instead JP again made her fall in love w/ Damon. That pretty much tells who she wanted to be the end game. Their Storylines sucks from season 5 and the show went downhill! #9785; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Stefan saving Elena from drowning in (3x22)!!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-21 06:15:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have always had double thoughts on stefan respecting Elena's choice in their relationship ( which is very good,you should respect your partner). But when it comes to life and death,i think he should look at a bigger picture. I can let go off of 2x20 incident as she never wanted to became a Vampire so stefan knew that but in 3x22, shouldn't he have save Elena first?! The funny part is that he even regrets it thrice in the series discussing it with Damon(4x01),Elena(4x01) and Caroline in some episode of season 7 where he kidnaps her and quotes "You should respect people choice but not when it comes to life and death" and when caroline said "you gave that choice to elena so now i want that too" and then he says " And then I lost her". So Stefan did that so Elena doesn't get mad at him because he know elena would have been really upset if Matt died?! As Damon has once said that He ll make all their and death decisions while he worries about Collateral damage ie. sabotage thing in their relationship?!? What are you thoughts on this event. I always end up in a serious fight with people on this so maybe you guys can make me look at it differently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I can't digest this theory of Nina coming back and then Stelena's Endgame after every thing that happened in 4-7 season. It just doesn't make sense. They did that doppleganger plot especially to make SE look forced and DE battling the odds and Coming together. If SE wanted to have happened,S6 was the best opportunity but still they did whole Delena Again... How can you walk away from proposal in season 6 by DAMON and Steroline development in s6-s7. They said they would have love to see if she would have made her way to Stefan.."Idk maybe or maybe not" She definitely WANTED to revisit the triangle but she lost the opportunity when she had it. Even If they would have made them come together kuddos to them. Elena's Character is already draaged because of doing this once. KW has always been Stelena Fan so surely he wanted to see them together. Its Just my take on it. #10084; #65039; #128515; nice day #128536;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I am a hardcore DE Shipper but their foundation of the Relationship is not very convincing. They should have done something other than sire bond. It is supposed to be a romantic bond formed b/w the Vampire due to the human feelings attached but its a huge excuse/ arguement in the fandom for the foundation and start of DE's Relationship. I get that breaking SE was hard but like this..lol no!! #9785; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's forgotten only on Youtube fanbase tbh. Its a huge discussion these days lmao. Tumblr is flooded with this and pretty much on reddit. But this was way back in 2009 and lot of people have recently started pointing it as an issue. JP also confirmed that he didn't rape her or maybe she was saving her ass. I personally don't believe he raped her but he definitely should have apologized. Caroline's behaviour towards Damon is really justified through out the series but then she is all nothing happened in season 8 but its still quite acceptable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well,there are so many ways to put it.For me their relationship never really worked. Their whole 4 month prior stalking her and then inserting himself to her life whilst she was going through grief is not convincing to me. He knew all the risks of being with her but still anyways he did that. I like the dynamic of Human Elena and Vampire Stefan as It's pretty much clear that Elena brings out his humanity and this stopped very much in season 4. I can't see them in a long run Relationship because for me Stefan was more serious in the relationship then Elena tbh. He should have learnt or atleast tried to calm his ripper side once through out the series by using Snatch,Eat and Erase to control himself so maybe he could have helped Elena in season 4. Damon is considered toxic for her but he can save her from anything even if she is a Vampire/werewolf/human and is definitely a more compatible boyfriend in saving her. #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

The fact he did it even if he didn't knew that she has Vampire blood in her system is just- Like if he knew she is gonna be a Vampire and then he let her die,i would have less problems with it because atleast she is not dying dying but then on the other hand she didn't wanna be a Vampire  #128565;.

    <TEXT>The writers only had balls to write Damon's Character nicely in the show. Every other Character has some *excuse* for doing bad things. They should have done something with Ripper side of Stefan. Its so annoying to see that anything bad from his side like eating children, whole village is just swept under the carpet as his HuMaNiTy is OfF oR hE is A riPPeR. The Damage is done,its wrong. They made him human in the last 6th episode and made him feel the guilt like you should have considered it before too. When someone asked the writers about why Stefan actions are not held accountable they said that he already has a lot to guilty for I mean- . Its not at all fair that you can blame kai,damon,klaus or even katherine for their deeds but when it comes to Stefan ,he has no intentions of doing it or he wouldn't do such things. I went off the topic sorry #128514;. Kai is my Favourite Character and as usual they do Characters dirty. Whats new?!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I wanted to put that point in it but I missed but like going to her house , constantly lying, i get that telling someone that you are a Vampire is a big deal and then on the top of that that are exactly look alike of my Ex too. He pretty much made a place in her heart in first half of the season 1. I am pretty sure that If she had known that he is a Vampire before hand of 1.06,she maybe or may not ve with him. Elena found it of herself that he is a Vampire and Idk when would have Stefan told her that? And when he was telling her his past as she want to everything,he still didn't tell her that she looks alike his ex girlfriend. Its Elena again who got to know about it and till then he have made himself into her heart, If she would have know this all prior hand their relationship would have complete different arc. I wanted Stefan to tell her all this and then see ELENA coping up with it. #10084; #65039; #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>See, the thing with "I got the girl" is him kind of paraphrasing what Alaric said to him befofehand twice "you got the girl,man" so no they were not Damon's word. About 3x15 yes I can not defend his words because that conversation is lame asf in itself to me. Elena is considered like a trophy on the show correct though.</TEXT>

The case with stefan is that you just can't hold him responsible. His fans will defend him as he had no intention of doing it. I don't like this thing. Damon can be bashed for the shit he do but stefan can't lol just because of bis ripper binge and humanity issue ffs. #128565;</TEXT>

And then his whole Nina Dobrev Jokes/ slut Shaming Elena etc. He rants a lot that is even unnecessary. He is however good in protecting environment and all that.

    <TEXT>Yeah I don't even think Elena owes any explanation to Stefan at all. It's really annoying seeing him all heart broken after 4.06 when he is the one who initiated the breakup. I took this discussion as many people defend caroline in this scene as she is "Stefan's friend" too. I find it wrong. She was way too much involved in this situation than the three Characters themselves.  #128514; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But again its ELENA's place to tell him even for the fact that she doesn't need to, they broke up, leave them alone. On that very night, Damon let Elena go too. I get where Damon was coming from but he still did it in the end. Caroline should not have told him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I respect Stefan a lot,trust me, I love that he protects other people and help them in any possible way. However I have major issues with this behaviour in S2-S3. And S4 Stefan is not the Stefan I know,they wrote him very different. I no where excuse Damon being being a complete nuisance to him and his Relationship whatsoever but this article PREETY much covers my points. I do disagree w/ almost every S1 points against him beacause of what and how Damon was to him,except his whole way of telling Elena about her past. I don't consider him Selfish as stated in the article below. https://www.fanpop.com/clubs/the-vampire-diaries-tv-show/articles/144453/title/stefan-most-selfish-hypocrite-character-on-tvd-p2 I won't say he is selfish but I do him as a hypocrite. You may not agree with these If you try to look at the context behind it in season 3 particularly but still I didn't like his attitude at all in S2-4.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mentioned it before too that I have no problem with Stefan's attitude towards Damon in season 1. Damon was absolutely horrible to everyone there. My point is not all mentioned up there in the article and I apologise for that. Its a pretty old and random post and I loved the points. #128514; How would you justify the whole love triangle situation mentioned in the article there?! ( In season 2- season 3). His character is not all well written in season 4 at all. I like him in season 6-8 a lot. And about that Elena thing, i personally felt like he should have opened up himself to her. It was always Elena who mostly confronted him about his past or his relationships. Obviously he would tell her because he doesn't want to screw up things b/w them. My question is how much long would he have taken to tell her that he is a Vampire or Elena is Katherine's doppleganger if she had not come to know it herself. He constantly lied to her. For the "dimmer switch" thing,I kind of agree with you,good parallel,why did you get downvoted lol?! #128515; #128514; However I doubt if elena knew about the link b/w them,i can't recall it. Also,yes it was their choice to stay w/ each other, no doubt but if Stefan had told her all this before maybe or maybe not things would have been same. In the end its "to each their own" Nice day #10084; #65039; #128515;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not talking about Elena, her switching brothers is not wrong in my opinion but the way they rushed it by making her sleep just after the breakup is a bummer. She should have waited for atleast 5-6 episodes no doubt ,I am watching a love triangle and can't stand a Couple for 6-8 seasons,not at all. She showed no respect for her Relationship w/ stefan and that has always bugged me even as a DE shipper. Wonder why people call that her Character has assassinated.I am talking about Bonnie, First of all, Bonnie is a loyal friend of Elena and she would not go for her boyfriend besides her comatose body for god sakes, Periodt. Also, Damon wouldn't do that either. Yes,they have good communication skills,cute moment and all but you should also look at the circumstances behind it. And as everyone knows, JP didn't go there not only because it's very lame taking the situation in hand but also she didn't want to piss the only majority of remaining people watching her not so very great season 7. #128566;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But the situations are different! Elena is in coma,you really think she would after her boyfriend,no absolutely not. And,about every other female on the show,i definitely agree JP pushed Bonnie's character way back in matter of her love life. Its would be interesting to see her pair w/ Kai. I would have even try to like Bamon for once if Elena was dead or something but it would still be lame because it shows that Damon has moved on so quick so it means he wasn't in love w/ her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't hate Stefan either. I am not talking about Damon here, it's about Stefan. Damon is very self absorbed and self centred. I have never seen Stefan being dragged for this kind of behaviour. The fact he was opening up her in 1.05,still didn't tell her anything about her resemblance with Katherine. He slept w/ her in 1.10 without even telling her this and when Elena got to know about this,i can absolutely feel what she would have felt for a moment. And About whole triangle, Stefan has definitely taken advantage of him in this matter. He wouldn't have been able to take down Elijah at all in 2.08 with himself. He had enough confidence that Damon wouldn't leave without protecting her and obviously Damon being Damon didn't leave. It's his behaviour and rubbing his relationship on his face( 2.19) "You will never earn her respect but you can be all in love with her because you will protect her." In season 3 too he expected Damon to protect Elena every single time but when he was so hell bent over taking his so called Revenge. He didn't apologize to Elena at all for his behaviour to her but suddenly when he knew that Damon and Elena kissed, he started realising that he shouldn't have gone too far by kidnapping her and it was too far. Its that he has no problem w/ Damon being in love with Elena but when Elena started reciprocating her feelings ,he got so mad. I was very pissed that he punched Damon after all this. He has always expected Damon to protect elena at any cost and be all in love but when things got different he should not be mad at her. On the other hand, Elena in season 4 is written all for Damon and I agree that she should have shown some respect towards him and his relationship by *NOT SLEEPING WITH HIM JUST AFTER BREAKUP*. Damon is the one who gets hate,Stefan doesn't. I don't even justifying Damon's bad behaviour, where he is horrible,he is. #10084; #65039; #128521; It was about Stefan that I was pointing so its better to keep Damon out of it. #129392;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Delena loved each other and it was *not* because of sire bond,yes I know it encouraged DE but she had human feelings for him. Yes they were toxic and obsessive but they were madly in love with each other and still fought against every bone thrown at them. They took multiple and long breaks through out season 5 and then came back together in 5x20. Now the person who has pined over a girl for two years ( call it his self esteem but he did love her through out a lot), wouldn't move on this quick. Bamon was encouraged by Ian too but it doesn't go with the storyline. Delena had not broken up with each other. They were very committed to each other and saw a future together. DE is the couple which is written with such depth and it wouldn't end like that. Had DE remained broken up in season 5 completely ,i would have definitely tried to enjoy them romantically.  #129392;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why are you bringing Elena here? I am talking about Bonnie, Talking of the sire bond,i know it's a lame plot to push DE together because it's not in elena's Character to switch Brothers like that but you can't say that she was not second doubting her choice in season 3 finale or she didn't love him,yes not more than Stefan I agree but she was falling. Her whole speech in the finale says that (which I agree is done to bait DE shippers with the lamest retcon ever). Julie screwed the fans to another extent in season 3 and when she realised she is going to loose 1/3 of a fandom,she went with sire bull. Julie is a racist no doubt. I love Bamon too but as friends, they definitely wouldn't piss the remaining people watching the show. I personally don't see any possibility w/ Bamon in season 6 start as both Damon and Elena were madly in love w/ each. Yes, absolutely they were hell toxic and obsessive but they did love each other. They took multiple breaks through out season 5 and then came back. If the writers would have kept them apart at all in season 5 (DE) absolutely i would have tried loving them( Bamon) as a romantic couple. People hate DE saying damon killed her brother twice or thrice/ sexually assaulted her but Damon has not been any better to Bonnie too.</TEXT>

Her baiting fans from beginning of season 3 is so damn annoying and she still did succeed in doing it till the end. Fake Promo's and what not.

    <TEXT>I meant *tried loving* them romantically. I love their friendship. I respect your opinion. There were lots of DE fans watching season 7 because of rumours of possible return of Nina and also she very smartly didn't kill Elena's and put her in coma ffs becaudr she knows who owns the majority of her fandom. Her name being mentioned every now and then/damon pining over a casket/ridiculous missing coffin plot etc had a lot of fans there on screen. She did throw a lot of Bamon scenes resulting in her audience which is mostly Damon stans who also happens to be DE shippers getting mad. Should have this matter ?! No absolutely not but she would not risk letting go off audience like that as we already know how she screwed all the SE/DE/BD fandom from season 3 and still did till the very end. I always have had issues w/ treatment of Bonnie's Character too on the show and she deserved better.I don't support Julie's behaviour if it sounded like that and yes i would have definitely loved to watch a *triangle* b/w them,no doubt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not saying I didn't want it,I just don't see it with the storyline going on. I completely respect your opinion. I mentioned Elena because of Damon as i find it hard for him get over Elena this easily as they have not broken up or something. A love triangle b/w these three, absolute yes,but a straight away relationship both reciprocating feeling towards each other is bit strange for me. I ship DE but that has literally nothing to do with me not shipping Bamon romantically, trust me and I find a lot of chemistry b/w them too. Julie is a racist piece of trash, can't agree more... #128566; She treated Bonnie horribly and I don't support her way of treating Kat's Character at all. if it seemed like that, apologies. If you notice,the very half of the season 7 has pretty decent amount of Bamon scenes, Now from what i have gathered from Threads/ tweets from those years is that majority of fandom was crazy as hell about Damon and they also happen to be DE shippers, got mad as hell because of this. Now every one knows that JP wouldn't want to lose half of her fans like this at all so it clearly visible in the show having their scenes removed or her getting ENZO for a fact. Julie Plec cares more about her business than having sane storylines which is clearly visible from mid season 3. She has a habit of screwing with fandoms and giving false hopes. #128566; She strung along fans, didn't care about storylines, as a result her raitings dropped drastically.</TEXT>

Who are the majority of fans here on sub? I am quite new so i don't really know. I personally have seen more hate for damon as compared to Stefan. Tbh He DESERVES some of it. Damon did everything in his power to bring back Stefan and Elena together. Its hypocritical too when only Damon is dragged for his actions in season 3 regarding Elena. Elena strangled him along the whole season 3 so that she wouldn't lose him, it's selfish of her too. Damon was moving on in season 4 when she made it pretty clear in 3.22 that she doesn't love him enough as compared to Stefan. Tbh its a never ending conversation. #128514; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely agree. However speaking of ratings, A lot of DE shippers left at the end of 3x22. Now If you look at the rush she made to get them together proves she knew that she screwed up bad w/ raitings and fans. The raitings dropped again after she bombarded us with Sire Bond shit after they slept together and lot of people left because of that. SE shippers stopped watching because of Delena in season 5 particularly. If DE fans would have done the same, raitings would be more down in season 3. For example- Season 3 Ep 19 ( Heart Of Darkness) is a DE centric episode with that kiss/makeout and as a result,a lot of SE's didn't watch it and it's the least viewed episode of season 3. Their raitings would have been still down if DE's stopped watching STELENA in s1-s3 beacause there are more fans of DE than SE. AFTER Season 5 episode 16, around 500k people didn't bother Coming back for next episode because of that Breakup and screwing again. It's not the SHIP but the way JULIE wrote them affected the raitings. Also, that doppleganger visions in season 5 are for SE shippers and this again proves that SE's were not watching because of DE. If the same thing DE's would have done in season 2-3 ,the scenario would be pretty same. Nice Day #128150;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of DE shippers left at the end of 3x22 and never bothered Coming back. Now If you look at the rush she made to get them together proves she knew that she screwed up bad w/ raitings and fans. The raitings dropped again after she bombarded us with Sire Bond shit after they slept together and lot of people left because of that. SE shippers stopped watching because of Delena in season 5 particularly. If DE fans would have done the same, raitings would be more down in season 3 but the Mikaelson brothers were great. For example- Season 3 Ep 19 ( Heart Of Darkness) is a DE centric episode with that kiss/makeout and as a result,a lot of SE's didn't watch it and it's the least viewed episode of season 3.

It's not the SHIP but the way JULIE wrote them affected the raitings. S1 to S3 have better plots with DAMON BEING VILLAIN/KATHERINE /MIKAELSON BROTHERS/AND STELENA AND DELENA ANGST. She wrote DE badly that's my take on it. Yes,it was rumoured/almost confirmed in season 7 that NINA is gonna return and Damon and Delena fans went crazy and harassed the shit out of julie to stop giving BAMON scenes. Also, that doppleganger visions in season 5 are for SE shippers and this again proves that SE's were not watching because of DE. If the same thing DE's would have done in season 2-3 ,the scenario would be pretty same. Nice Day #128150;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Least- Everything w/ DE (3x22/3x01) She did fell in love w/ Damon in season 3 but seriously they picked the most lame scene for it.(My opinion)and that meeting them first is a cinematic masterpiece but still It didn't make sense to me.(and i am saying this being a hardcore DE shipper) #128514; .Also not a big fan of Universe doppleganger plot. The Most Favourite- Probably all the Enzo Stuff with Damon ( Augustine Vampire) and bit of Salvatore's history in season 7. What's your least and most favourite?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though I am not a big fan of the Sire Bond,here's my take on it. I think she was falling out of love in season 3. She did show this in multiple episodes, eg- When she says to Damon that we will let him go,I'll not love a ghost for the rest of my life etc etc...blah blah. Yes she did love him but her feelings for Damon were also there. The thing is that Sire Bond would have much more sense if the writers didn't rush it so much so as to gain back their DE audience which they lost at the end of 3x22.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because, everything in season 3 led to elena having feelings for Damon and it was quite clear. Julie created a lot of hope for DE fans but at the end she chose stefan and people got mad. Now I do have some problem w/ ( in circumstances)her choosing Stefan in 3x22 and then all retcons she pulled. She should have gone to DAMON in s3 only or should not have gone at all. Their magic was kind of lost after wards coz of Sire Bond but still I love them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. She chose to say goodbye to Stefan than to Damon which is quite clear because what they had was important to her. I would have really preferred her choice of *with whom she wanted to be* than this ending. That's the point where I was not happy with the writers. They made her choose in haste and under such complicated situation of both dying. Who would she have chosen in terms of being with them in a relationship was better idea tbh and would have been better for Audience to understand. The thing is that Julie/ Ian made it look like a excuse to make DE happen/ to break SE in multiple interviews so people still doesn't believe it even if it is made clear in the show which is canon. She's prone to denial and guilt so I get why she chose to say *goodbye*. Do you think Elena would have broken up w/ Stefan if there would be no sire bond?!?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was the only reason tbh. Candice suggested it to Julie as she obviously went with it. Julie couldn't let go of Caroline,the deutaragonist, after Elena,the protagonist left the show,so I get why she didn't let this lame story go off the table. Yes obviously the timeline doesn't make sense to me either and I have no idea what would happen if valerie would not be there. Its TVD, they would made something up for that too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are platonic as hell. I think as Delena was a thing and they kind of wanted to end the triangle for a while,they went with Steroline. You can see that they started giving them much more scenes starting from 4/5th season. Tbh I don't see any chemistry but stefan seemed happier and more open w/her. Their 8x16 scenes makes me cry thats it. So yes it's a filler pair *for me*. How long could they fool people with S/E/D triangle,think about it,they did it in season 5 and it sucked. #128514; #128158; #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

I am confused as hell about this as there are very peculiar things to it, so I wanted to see what are your opinions and take on it?! For Andie, People believe as she was under compulsion from season 2 till start of the season 3 and thats the time jump of two months,they obviously would have had sex but thats not shown in the show and hence people believe its not canon and defend him on it. Same for Caroline,we never see them having sex after he compelled her/took away her consent but they still did kiss and then her clothes are different too in 1x02/1x03.. Ughhh I am confused...

    <TEXT>About Elena, I don't like season 5 elena as she was quite hyprotical and her statements to Damon and Stefan are ridiculous and very OOC. But I do like her in the sense that she was much more confident/ less confused. I don't like Season 3 Elena at all. Actually there wasn't actually main plot for her so her after season 3 so romantic life was much explored. thats my opinion. Katherine is much enjoyable in only first 10 episodes of season 5. Jeremy was useless. Matt was always useless. I love Silas though  #128514; #128514; #128514;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't stomach it because this act made him look like some psychopath and literally destroyed every thing his Character developed into trash. I do get that he wanted revenge but I guess i can't imagine it being something more important than Elena (as we have seen it from season 2 till forever tbh) to him as he knew that Elena doesn't like this stuff and her reaction said it all. Again killing Aaron is just stupid to me but I guess thats Damon being all hyped up by Enzo. I stan Damon and Delena to death but this all was beyond my reach.

    <TEXT>I think Damon was falling for her in season 1 but that doesn't imply that he had nothing for Katherine in season 1. His hate literally started to come out in 1x15 after Anna told him that Kat never cared for him and what not. You can parallel (not exactly) it with Elena in season 3 too,she was falling for Damon real hard but in the end she wanted her's and Stefan's Relationship a try again as they have had something in past ( same for datherine). So no, Damon loved Elena for she was not because of Katherine betrayal. Thats my opinion. #128151;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She slept with him before knowing he was a vampire (at the end of season 2),then he bites her,the peculiar point of this is that her clothes are changed in 1x02( pink lingerie) and 1x03( a sleeve top ) so it's *assumable* that they had sex afterwards but it's not shown hence it's not canon. She was compelled but we never saw them again having sex but yes, kissing was there. If you can only assume that they had sex,not being shown on the show then it falls under *rape* which is the same case with Andie, Damon fed off her blood after compelling (2x13), she's with him from ending of season 2 to starting of season 3 again stating that they would have obviously had sex afterwards against her consent. I personally don't believe anything but what's shown on the show but you can view it like this as those who claim he did rape both of them. You can say that obviously if she would not have been compelled,they would have never had sex again. It's the same what Stefan writes in his diary, DAMON read it in 3x03 " I wake up in places I don't recognise,with women I don't remember" so obviously that is straight away rape too but as it's not shown on the show, it's not canon,same apply to Damon too, Right?! Elena only knew about the bites not the sex portion. I personally have mixed views about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Caroline is my favourite female character in TVD,hands down. I do have some problems with her hyprocritical statements as she judge people for the same shit she do all the time. Maybe it's because of the fact that I can't stand Elena at all in S2-S3 and S5 and Bonnie's Character is not at all enjoyable however She is still the most selfless Character on the show and I respect her lot. So that leaves Caroline for me #128517;. She is far better than Elena tbh. This kind of Character is enjoyable on screen but no,she isn't that good if we dig deep down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as *fiction* is considered,he doesn't interest me at all. Personally I prefer him when he is not dating Elena (S3,S6,S7,S8) or he is a ripper/has no humanity as atleast he has some personality tbh. Obviously If you mix fiction and real life,I can get why people like him more and obviously he is slight better but in fiction,he bores me to death. Even writers didn't do anything much with his Character, whenever nothing's up for Stefan,he becomes a ripper or they make him go all *no humanity* Stefan and it became very boring till the very end of season 8.

I respect your opinion. #9786; #65039; Are you referring to Stefan forcing Damon to Un-Sire her coz I could clearly see Damon's heart breaking in 4x08 in school he asked her to drink from the bloodbag and she did and then instantly he started the address to visit Nandi the witch. I mean yes obviously Stefan told him about the sire bond but I really don't think he had any idea about Elena being sired to him before .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes absolutely,i am no where comparing familial and romantic love,it was just kind of what I have noticed from the show in general. Damon obviously loved Stefan a lot. Yes,Damon said that thats why I put Jeremy on top In Elena's list. Now why I put Elena over Stefan there in Damon's is Because I couldn't remember any moment like that and he has been quite selfless when it comes to her. Even in 8x14,he died himself so that means he holds both of them at equal position,so I was judging it from the past seasons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly,I am such a DE shipper but this is such a inconsistent plot,I mean c'mon. I think she was being harassed or something by episode 4 or 5 so she did this mess because I never exactly observed her being sired to him untill the episode 7. Here she is completely denying it but In the ninth episode, her whole body was asking to go away from Damon (from the lake house) #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely,I rooted from them from season 1 and they ruined it really well here. This couple could have been written better imo. The retcon she pulled at the 3x22 started the mess tbh. I can honestly never say that she was totally "sired" to him. Sure she was but it's very observable from the episode 7 only. Sometimes she agress with him, sometimes she doesn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes he did,twice in the row in the beginning. He asks her not to go. As his sire,she should obey him. How she obeyed him in the episode 9 then when he asks her to go back home supposedly setting her free. It's inconsistent writing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Human Elena would have never chosen Damon. Vampire Elena works better with Damon than Stefan. The Sire Bond is quite messy. Yes,she would have chosen Damon over Stefan as a Vampire but gradually as it would be a very long process and JP said it herself that it would take lots of season for her to choose Damon over Stefan. Sire Bond just fastened it. I think Human Elena is perfect with Stefan and Vampire Elena with Damon. Vampire Elena and Vampire Stefan are dysfunctional and that's just my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's what I have thought of- I mean he saved her and being desperate by her resemblance,he wanted to reassure that she wasn't Katherine. As a result he observed her for 4 months including digging about her past life, checking her birth certificate which confirms that she wasn't Katherine so to know her more and enrolling himself in her highschool does not make sense untill unless he wanted to date her. He himself approached to her thrice (Men's washroom, Graveyard, her house) so I do think that he wanted to be with her. #128524; Ps- I love Damon and I have never hated him except for some things he did in season 1 like- Abusing care, killing lexi etc. I am a huge fan of him. #127801;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find this theory interesting but I don't think you can apply it to season 1-3 Stelena's Relationship because it's a retcon so basically No,they were in love on their own not because of this compulsion. She swapped brothers under the influence of really strong Sire bond otherwise it's very OOC from the side of Elena. If you still do not consider the retconning and consider the canon, it's pretty lame tbh to think that they were in love because of it. #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I meant to say was she would be having HORRIBLE timing swapping brothers,it's not in Elena's Character as we have seen her in first three seasons. She definitely was in love with him but she was good at denying feelings so sire bond (being stronger than her love for Stefan) made her do that easily. I also know that the Sire Bond exists because of her human feelings but her loyalty towards Stefan had her denying the love of Damon for a very long time. #128149;</TEXT>

Season 1 (14-22).I can watch Season 2 and 3 again and again but then Season 4 sucks from middle. Season 5 ( 1-10/19-22). Season 6 is my favourite. I don't rewatch 7 and 8 season at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's based upon opinions. However KW's statement of Nina coming back in S8 from starting and them warping back to SE doesn't make sense to me after every thing that happened in S3-6.They were written in a endgame sort of way. I don't particularly get how they DE and SC would be broken to get SE back. Even If i shipped SE and the same claim was for DE,i would have still said the same. They literally almost got married in S6 / she became a human and was still with Damon so I don't know how you'd do that?! Stefan was still very much into Caroline after 3 years so it doesn't make sense to me. One way I see Damon moving on from Elena was him pairing with Bonnie but Bonnie was paired with Enzo so again how Bonenzo would be broken up?! Elena's Character would have just been more degraded than it already was if she does something like that. It's absurd for me to imagine to *break up with man to date his brother and date his brother again*. Or again maybe KEVIN could pull something out. I find it pretty hard to move back to SE from the proposal and promises of forever/ seeing future and all that in S5-S6. However on "meaning to be together" SE were pretty good on that front too so it's about what you prefer. That's just my opinion. Have a nice day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226;Elena's method was indeed very naive and childish,I agree but I dont think Elena was trying to make him fall for her all over again (what OP claims) And I don #8217;t even think she wanted to kiss him. She was just trying to help him remember and she had this very naive and childish hope that talking about their relationship would help him do that. I don #8217;t think her almost kissing him was manipulative. The way I saw that almost kiss was her deliberately NOT kissing him and the second that Stefan goes in for the kiss #8230; SHE stops him and tells him she's with Damon. If she wanted to kiss him ,she wouldn't have backed off at first. When he put her hand back on his face,she was just hoping the proximity would spark some sort of memory and it failed miserably. Frankly, I don #8217;t think that Damon and Elena had any idea of what to do to get him to remember. They tried some stuff before and it didn't work. Elena even asked for Bonnie after Everything she tried wasn't working. She started with bumping/Jumping on rooftop/wooshed her to ferris wheel (didn't mention the kiss) and then he himself put it together that they were in a relationship and she went with it coz she knew that Relationship meant a lot of him.( Albeit It was quite flirtatious,i agree)  #8226;About 5x06, The Jealous looks you mentioned seemed "annoyed" to me rather than" jealous". She was really upset that Tessa told Damon to kill Silas resulting in not getting Bonnie back. After that "annoyed" look,she actually started crying(the camera cuts very shortly afterwards) so I personally don't think she was jealous. I am not defending her as I am very well aware that she is a attention seeker and can be manipulative at times.She has always had a fear of loosing one of the brothers (3.21) so that's why She wanted Stefan to atleast know her. I don't see it as making him fall for her. I think her reaction over here(5.06) was in her character because we have seen her reacting like this in many episodes( for eg:3.15/4.13) What I call jealous from her side was 3.06 (Barbeque one).  #8226;She went even as far as in next episode saying that while he was drowning,she was the happiest she has ever been. I don't think you say something like this to someone if you want them to fall for you again. Sorry this came out to be long. It's just how I see it. You can always have a different approach at it. *Have a good day/night* :) #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8730; #8730;Just Wanted Opinions; I know a lot of people dislike/hate Vampire Elena ,the popular reasons being  #8226; Crazy Obsession w/ Damon and handling Jeremy and her friends.  #8226; That Mass Genocide (idk if it falls in hating Vampire Elena category).  #8226;This conversation w/ Stefan seemed off and OOC to a lot of people (include me in it); [5.07] Elena: So, he's dead. It's over. Stefan: Yeah, it's over. Elena: Are you okay? Stefan: I'm fine. Elena: Look at me and tell me that killing Silas worked. That you'll be okay now. Stefan: Why is this so important to you? Elena: Because I know how much he stole from you. Stefan: Yeah, and he's dead. Elena: *And because while you were suffering in that safe, grasping onto hope, fighting every second so you wouldn't lose your humanity...I was happy. I got everything that I wanted, Stefan. I got to be in love, I got the summer of my dreams, I got Bonnie back. So I need to know that this worked. I need to know that it's gonna take away all your suffering. I need to know that you're gonna be okay*. Stefan: I wanted it to be you. When that safe finally opened and somebody found me...I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be both of you. Lot of people could not picture human Elena saying something like this. I get this pissed a lot of people. I also get that Vampirism brings out what's already there,it amplifies your inner self.I see people hating her a lot for this and saying that she lost her compassion for her friends, there's a lot more but can't post it all. Then I have also seen people questioning her way of reacting to Stefan's death in S5. *Which scene seemed off to you or made you think she was different?* Ps: I don't "hate" Vampire Elena. I personally feel like she was much happier and less depressed but yes, she was different.</TEXT>

Damon: You don't want to be like this. Elena: Then how should I be? *Should I go back to being the scared little girl who couldn't admit what she wants*? Is that how you'd prefer me to go back to being, or-- Look. For the longest time, you wanted to be with me, but you were scared that I'd find out how awful you are. But it doesn't matter anymore because I don't care I myself prefer human elena than Vampire Elena. I know she always preferred being human than a Vampire but she also loved "some" aspects of being a Vampire and she mentioned it too in S5-6. Nice Day. #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so I watched The haunting of hill house like 2 months back and I was not really a fan of it. Like I didn't find it scary enough but the story telling and plot was decent. Now I really wish to watch Bly Manor so is it any better in comparison ( like more scarier than THOHH) or not?I really love Watching the whole set of series so was thinking to give it a go but if it's nothing special so I ll cut it off my list. Thank You. #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know what I have noticed is that it also depends upon who writes the episode like lot of events from the past are not acknowledged properly and it sucks. Like for eg: 3x19 and then 3x20. Like in 3x20 it seems like nothing happened b/w D amp;E in past episodes. Elena did ask Stefan to help him but Idk I think he was pissed at him because of Elena maybe and then suddenly Elena even gave up too and yes it seemed a bit off. Bonnie didn't help because Damon turned her Mom into a vampire but She does help people a lot so I think this time she let it go.</TEXT>

I don't think they would have done that cause S/E/D triangle was the center for the show. I personally don't see anything with her Character.

    <TEXT>I myself see no chemistry between them(Steroline),they gave those platonic vibes to me.I like them kind off. I just feel that Lexi was introduced as his bff and he even said that there were no romantic feelings involved whatsoever so it's kind of weird (for me) to see them going that way. Many people do see chemistry b/w Steroline, it's subjective. I really don't believe writers(JP) giving time to side Characters and showing how they became a Vampire. #128566;</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;yeah this scene is like the final episode, it's emotional but if you think about it too much there's a lot of things that don't make sense. but well to be fair they knew it was risky but it wasn't in their plans to actually die, specially because Bonnie never told them that she was going to die and that with every person that passed it brought her one step closer to death Exactly,i mean i cried a lot there but if you put too much emphasis on it,it was dumb. Then I also didn't like that Damon only said goodbye to Elena not Stefan but I think that there was not enough time?! The show romanticises alot of weird stuff not only for DE but SE too.</TEXT>

I don't know how you joke about something like that, considering he have had history with het.Even if he does not mean it, who in the right mind would say something like that?He claims to a vocal feminist but have made so many inappropriate comments like making r*pe jokes about Bonnie's Character. Now I have literally watched all these interviews and video's myself but I really can't find the links.  gt;I have a hard time believing Nina would go out to dinner with him or that Paul would be so close to him if he said it to be mean and accuse her of being unattractive. I think he just doesn't know when he's not being funny to be honest Everyone knows that he's bitter because of the Breakup. Ian finds Nina very attractive and he has said this multiple times when they were together. About that dinner thing, I have no idea about it. They went for a goodbye dinner and it had all cast members. In the end it's *to each their own*. I personally don't like him at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd personally say they handled the triangle badly in Season 3 and when they knew they screwed up, they introduced that Sire Bond to fasten things up and to gain the fans they were loosing cause clearly the way things rushed in first 10 episodes is debatable. One of the many reasons season 4 sucks is badly written triangle drama.</TEXT>

It's like her boyfriend's out of the picture for 2 months and she's falling for his brother, I don't buy it. Maybe she starts to fall for him at that point idk lol but definitely those feelings weren't that much till later half of the season 3. 3x19 is a good one too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The one you mentioned. Absolutely ridiculous. Then there are some I really don't like and they ruined the entire season for me.  #8226; Season 4 : Dragging the Sire Bond till the end. Also No Humanity Elena Ughh.  #8226; Season 5: Doppleganger Prophecy. The famous Katherine-Elena body Swap. Unnecessary DE drama. Ugh.  #8226; Season 6 : Memory less Elena. #129317;  #8226; Season 7 : Everything except bit of phoenix stone story line,I think it was quite interesting.  #8226; Season 8 : Everything. I don't like a shit in that season except some season 1 flashbacks lmao. Also not a big fan of Season 1 but there's no bad plot I think. Season 2-3 are really good. There's some things I feel were bit my not my favourite in season 3 but Season 2 is absolutely perfect for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Elena was lying to him about when she fell for Damon. Once she admitted that it was on her birthday,the process went easily. If she would have said this earlier,it would have taken the same amount of time as Klaus took to compell Stefan:) It also took time because Alaric was nit used to compelling people,he said it once during the process If i am not wrong.</TEXT>
