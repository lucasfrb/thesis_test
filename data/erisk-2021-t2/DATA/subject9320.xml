    <TEXT>So, I gave in... Now. I, Am no writer by any stretch of the word. Nor am I an artist with any amount of skill. I honestly, most likely dont do anything very well. Actually maybe one thing.. sitting on my butt. shaking my head. Mostly at myself. But more increasingly, Im finding... Im becoming more aware of my sorroundings. More aware of the world around me. Im realizing... Im not too different from all these so called adults I once used to view as somewhat, "godlike" beings. They were all knowing, wise beyond understanding. They were powerful, able to grab you by an ankle, and lift you what seemed like 30 feet off the ground, where surely you would splatter if they decided to open their grip. Im not so sure now... They're just like me. They dont know crap. We're all just figuring it out as we go. Now that ive become one of those giant gods of my youth, I can finally see. We are all just trying to survive. and put a purpose to our existence. We sit on the leading edge of the river of time. Floating through the universe.. On a rocky, wet, moldy, rock. Festering with tiny insects, Invisible to the grand scale of even our own solar system. Insects who have touched the void of the sea of the fabric of reality. Yet still cannot comprehend the uniqueness of their own personal existence in this rediculous idea of the reality we live in. This reality.. where particles, are the basic building blocks of our visual, and material existence. We can touch them, and feel them, we can see them, taste them, smell them, hear them. We experience particles, we breath them in to live, second by second. On the grand scale, they create meteors, comets, planets, suns and galaxies. Yet on the micro level... Clouds, Mountains, Lakes, Trees, humans. Even smaller.. atoms, electrons, neutrons, quarks. Which we cant even imagine. Which are filled with? Empty space. where things pop into and out of existence. Empty space that is more than the amount of matter in the actual object. More empty space than all the matter in all the objects in the entire universe! wtf.. We live on a solid mass of empty space where zoomed into close enough, you see absolutely nothing at all in front of the lens. Yet zoomed out far enough, you can see me typing this bullcrap. Further you see the earth spinning and flying, as if its a glob of dust, through a sea of nothing. Further still, you see billions, of billions, of globs of dust flying and spinning and swirling around each other... Through a sea of nothingness. Zoom out farther and you see strings of dust and smoke swirling together suspended in a bubble outside of which we can see... nothing. Whats out there? whats in here? Hey wait... whats over there? Green paper! oh NO, no no You want to do things your way? eff that! We cant get focused on anything in particular... as a species. We have a horrible track record in the cooperation area. And why not? we are a tribal species. We protect our spoils. Our food, our homes, and loved ones. Maybe we just havent evolved as quickly as our lifestyles have... In the past we had to fight to the death for food and "booty" Now we have it all in the palms of our hands.. Seems now-a-days, a click of a button is all it takes for any kind of worldly pleasure you can think of. We are connected by the internet like nothing in the history of our solar system ever has been before. The whole globe communicating... Individuals' thoughts, ideas, creativities, innovations, fears, prejudices, vices... its almost as if.. a global conciousness is emerging? pfft yeah right... but who knows. Maybe if we dont kill ourselves first... We might ruin what we might end up becoming because we were too stupid the first time around. Maybe it'll take some darwinian justice for us to realize that if the human species is going to become the literal thinking organ of our living spaceship. We'd be better off taking care of our body. Earth, (like me) needs to kick its smoking habit, if its gonna hope to avoid having a stroke.. (like my chain-smoking gpa). But a bad habit isnt the only thing the earth has going against it. The earth never had any guidance as a child. It never had no one to tell it right from wrong. It had to figure things out on its own. Its experiences slowly grew and connections were made, just like those in the brain of a growing adolescent. And just like a teen, who doesnt think straight. With a smoking habit. Most of the time we dont know what we are doing from one moment to the next. Regretting decisions weve made seconds after making them. Arguing with ourselves. Cutting ourselves, killing ourselves. fighting eachother. But we learn. We build connections. we are on the verge of something. the earth might be about to hit its sweet sixteen. Idk what it is lately. Things are happening, and it seems like a new page is about to turn on a new era in our little civilization. Things could go alot of different ways. Theres really no way to even imagine anything. because everything will be like nothing we could even reference in our current lives. And living through it, you wont even realize anything has changed. Its just life.. Our technology has brought us to a point, where given the focus and the will of the people we can make meaningful and lasting impacts on our future. We could become the brain of the planet if we put our "minds" to it. The problem is... We've become too advanced for evolution to catch up with us... We have all this technology. All this connectedness. All the food and luxury and comfort in the world. But we are selfish. We are too different from each other. We have different skin. We speak different languages. We live on different sides of a line. We dont like to share our space. we are, still animals... pretending to be smarter than we are. Oh well... Maybe in a few more generations, after the darwinian purge and the reboot of civilization. Or if we manage to awaken just enough to realize we cant smoke 2 packs a day everyday sustainably. For any extended amount of time. But right now... Im gonna enjoy the time we live in, and continue to shake my head about the actions of myself, and the fellow fuck- ups of my species... Because thats part of the process.. Trial and error. Its how you learn... I can't tell you how to build a laptop. Or explain how the internet works. But I can tell you that a stove is, Fucking HOT! Im content in riding it out. And seeing how everything plays out. Im curious to see the discoveries these goofy looking apes come up with. Because nothing they could imagine could blow my mind more than the concept of the reality that we exist inside of. So go ahead. make war. Pollute as much as you can. go nuts. Shit ill still throw my cig wrapper out the window. I know I dont like change. but hopefully. maybe not in my liftime. but hopefully my kid's or his kid, we will figure it all out. Itd be awesome if the human species became some starwars type civilization. Im sure we'd find someway to screw it up though.. But maybe not.. Obviously.. anythings possible. But anyways. I dont know shit. Im nobody. like I said. I have no right even trying to think about half the shit I try to wrap my head around. Im just a guy sitting in my wife's craft room on a slow ass laptop listening to crackpot radio, smoking and drinking pepsi, while typing some random rant about the universe and existence. I dont understand half the concepts i'm writing about. I only just created my twitter account today. I dont have an active facebook account. I work for a living. And I doubt after this weekend ill have much more time to sit here and type... although, I must admit. Its easier than doing it with a pen... shame. I havent written anything worth reading since high school. If that even can be called as such. partly because I avoid it so much my hand cramps up after only 1 paragraph But what I have done is think... Constantly. think and listen and see. I dont know who I think I am right now. Or why I think I need to type this crap in wordpad. I dont know what I'll do with this poorly edited wall of text. Its not like I have a website. This is actually the longest i've been on a computer since I was in high school. living with my parents. playing halo online with auto headshots on. I guess I got tired of staring at the wall with the tv playing in the background thinking about how stupid I am, and all of us are... yet how smart I must be to realize this. Yet how dumb I am, that its true.. and somehow that even makes sense. Everything is the way it should be... And in the end. Whether we like or not. it'll all work out. So.. Maybe I'll go down this branch of my little personal universe and see where this path takes me.. it'll work out. TLDR Sat in my wifes Craftroom It got weird</TEXT>

    <TEXT>actually, that is the problem. Everything humans do is 100% natural. building skyscrapers, and satellites, sending emails and text messages. Hell! Sending a dick pic is a'kin to a quail spreading its feathers. How much more bigger and fatter is yours than the next guy? If humans cause their own extinction, it'll be all part of the ebb and flow of life. conversely, if we continue along this path, and someday immortalize the decendents of our species into some cosmic utopia, and somehow manage to look back on the universe, and contemplate the world outside of our dusty bubble. well... thats natural too.. burning coal, driving cars spilling oil into the ocean. everything we do as an "intentional species", meaning, we act out our will, creating and changing things. Instead of just dealing with our environment. Is ultimately, what life tends to do when left alone for a few billion years. even if we end up merging with the technology that we have such a symbiotic relationship with as it is. We will be the most natural robots in the universe. but even that is a redundancy, because even the supernatural is natural, as well as any effd up thought you can ponder, or fantastical machine or device you can imagine... so, you are correct sir, and I am fully aware how natural our situation is. but hopefully our natural stupidity, will never be a match for the resilient little bacteria clinging to their moldy rock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah, what a world we find ourselves placed in. All the injustices and seemingly wasteful use of resources, yet somehow it all works out in our personal experiences... think about it, while walking through a crowd. you could never count all the faces, the tones of voice, the eye color, the clothing styles. every one of those millions of people who run through times square every day, or all those people sitting in traffic on the freeway in seattle. everyone of them, looks different, sounds different. they act different, like different food, have their own opinions. how many different thoughts must be flying through the air at one time. how many different ideas are disregarded as being stupid or a waste of time, based on the notion of what the other animals will "think." most of us walk through lif secure in the fact that we have it all figured out. pay your bills... get more money... to pay more bills. what those most responsible and reasonable among us havent figured out yet, possibly to the fault of our civilization. no one has a fucking clue. the fact that we sit here in this snapshot of the history of everything and are having discussions of this nature are more incredible than any issue or dillemma facing the world today as a whole. when you think about what everything is at its basest of levels. little pieces of shit. little pieces of shit, who fit with other little pieces of shit, and stick together. we're all full of shit. we just don't realize it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lets try and go a bit deeper, if we may. Those wires, those electrical signals. the fish and the algae. beneath those bricks and asphalt and buildings, exist within the same point on a dot: less than the size of a pixel on our monitor screen if our view could encompass the galaxy. yet, inside those tiny wires, electrical signals move. they move at the speed of light, through a wire less than the diameter of a pencil, to bring us information encoded in the signal. of which is made up of things infinitely smaller than what we could imagine. All of this takes place on something so massive in our own perception of reality. but in actual reality, gets lost in the sea of dark. will our interactions ever mean anything to anyone who may be looking up from their moldy rock, at the sea of fireflies in their alien sky. will they ask the questions we are discussing? or do they know the answers already? have they seen behind the curtain that is pulled over us by our limited ability to sense our world? maybe. But, I've got a meatloaf cake. and that's a bit more interesting for now. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope so as well. Meanwhile, the idiot ape geniuses of this speck of dust are on the verge of creating intelligences exponentially greater than the sum of all the creatures on the planet. Our technological evolution has occurred so rapidly, yet our minds are similar to that of the ancients. Dick pics are akin to a peacock spreading his feathers to attract a mate, while lack of face to face interactions expose the darkest side of humanity. Maybe our species will be smart enough to realize we are too dumb on our own. Will our technology allow us to access the darkest places of our fellow creatures thoughts, at the same time showing us the beauty and uniqueness of the individual universe of their mind. Giving us insight into that persons physical experience of the cosmos he exists in. Naked inside a vacuum. Will it let us understand what it really is to be a human? Rather than the denial we place upon ourselves in our "society". What if our growing social networks and sharing of experiences, thoughts and ideas, were like the growing pathways in the brain of a newborn child. Forming memories and personalities, expressed on the global scale. If given enough time and if we can avoid self destruction. Could we become the consciousness of our planet? And once it can no longer support our existence will we flee? Like a soul from a once lively corpse, invisible from our former planetary perspective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im currently a ghost clan. With two others who are pretty active. I play at night, as I get off work late as well. Proactively recruiting right now, in order to upgrade to Shadow. Full two floor dojo with all labs (2 in const. Probably will finish them tonight.) obst course and all that. Looking for 2 experienced guys I could trust as warlords. So if your interested in making a badass clan with me I'd be very happy to have you. This is my first run through with the game. Im rank 4. Ive got a good handle in things and don't need any help in the way of resources or anything. I've built the entire dojo myself. And have a pretty awesome emblem waiting for approval. Just need dedicated guys to help me take over the universe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A calculator makes you think that? Well consider how small we are, in terms of dust mites on the planet floating through the cold, dark void of space. Passengers on a spaceship with no roof traveling through the universe clinging to our edge of the arm of a gigantic pinwheel desperately trying to fling us away, yet hanging on with the strength of her massive central black hole, whos event horizon is even larger than every planet in our solar system, as well as other solar systems combined. Then consider, inside you... One of the smallest units of measure on the cosmic scale, you are mostly empty. Empty space like the rest of creation. Full of nothing like the darkness of deep space.. When we go out there, are we actually entering ourselves?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Correct me if I'm wrong.. But once you are in space and weightless, I don't think you need to worry about the weight:fuel paradox. It takes almost no fuel to maintain orbit, save for a pulse every once in a blue moon to keep the craft on its trajectory. No rocket scientist by any stretch. Just seems to me they could add whatever they wanted as long as they don't have to launch the thing anymore. At least that's the theory behind 3d printing in space. Easier to just make materials there, than to launch them up and out of earths atmosphere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But you no longer need to propel yourself out of the earths atmosphere and the drag experienced in orbit is negligible compared to on launch. My point is, why would it matter how much mass you have in orbit. You could potentially add or remove or create any size structure you need without having to worry about propelling it with massive fuel reserves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S Despite flawed leadership is fundamentally good. We stand for common sense in treating people with dignity, respect, and human kindness. Our government may be infested by corrupt people interested in their own agenda, but also there are good men working against the men who would do us, and the rest of the world harm. America is not perfect, we are not benevolent gods, put here to oppress or impose our will on people who do things differently. Our nation tries to help, when the international community faces a crisis, they look to the U.S. Not because we are better, or more economically able, hell all of what we do is funded mostly by other countries, hence the massive debt. But what we are, as a people on a specific patch of dirt. We have a spirit of goodwill as americans, fostered into our country through endless conflicts and the desire to prove we have worth more than what we can offer militarily. America does not want to rule the world. A handful of hidden "human scum" want that. What we want, is a world where every human, has a chance to realize their full uninhibited potential. We are, as humans, tiny cosmic bubbles of endless potential. Why squash it out of any one of us? Every human has the right to believe, write, paint, love, hate or engage in any activity that does not infringe upon the abilities of another human to do the same. We are all humans living on this patch of dirt floating through the cosmic dust of other cold worlds. We are the Humans of the Sol System, Milky Way. Not the DPRK or the U.S We don't have to abide by the same rules to lead our people. But we should give everyone the same love, rights and respect, as afforded to the Dear Leader. Take care brothers. -American 20 something.</TEXT>

But i have constantly been having the desire to be a comic and I have a pretty nice collection of random scraps of paper ive written jokes or topics of bits that are most likely very much crappy. I went to an open mic at the underground in seattle and signed up but only managed to make the bump list. Im just looking for advice. Like should i wait a while and work on a set list? All of my jokes are untested and are currently just bullet points on paper. Should I work on fleshing them out first or work them out on stage. I have no idea where to start only that i need to find a mic and use it. Just not sure how to start. Btw written on iphone sorry if its an ugly wall of text.</TEXT>

My biggest concern in life is absolute freedom, and any place on earth where freedom can be expressed as much as possible, I feel cannot be too terrible, as ultimately people are allowed to be happy however they please. Im very curious as to why his supporters speak of him as if he is a Holy Figure. Is it due to being cautious of the consequences of not treating him with the upmost respect at all times? Will other north Koreans look down upon you if you do not devote your love to him? Or is it simply the admiration of a person who has the responsibility to bring back nationalistic prosperity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obama doesn't send citizens to do anything. He will, alternatively come do a podcast in your garage surrounded by secret service. Pretty insightful honestly. (He says nigger 0.o) It seems to me the rest of the world is completely fine with ignoring North Korea, Its just North Korea refuses to be ignored. Anti americanism is very popular because for some reason the US has found itself in an unfortunate enforcer's role in the world. One no other developed country is willing to accept and fall into debt due to. I wish we could be neutral and let the world find someone else to complain about. We the people only want people to be free and happy, as well as politicians who are also people too.. Most people are kind, and want the best for others. Labeling the west as nothing but the enemy is a disservice to humanities shared future. One in where there are no "True" Koreans or "True" democracy. But True freedom. True personal sovereignty. True Humanity. We are all brothers and sisters charged with safeguarding our bubble in the ocean of the universe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We used to specifically train our dogs not to guard food from the time they were pups, right along side potty training. If they would show any sign of aggression we would pull them away from the food and flip em on their back instantly. We would also feed them very small pieces of hotdog or whatever from our hand and if they tried to take it away too quickly and aggressively we would take our hand away and they wouldn't get the piece of food. The only way they would get it is if they carefully took it from our fingers being very careful not to bite anything but the food. This way they would learn that the very last thing you should ever do if you don't want to starve, is be aggressive to the hand that feeds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just move your finger in a small circle before you throw, you'll notice the ball start to spin in your hand. If you make the ball curve intentionally you shouldn't have any problems. Currently Lvl 20 and I very rarely miss balls. Even if the Mon breaks out of the ball, you don't lose that ball. Its not that difficult once you start using the mechanic to your advantage, besides you get a boost to your capture rate as well, by throwing curves, add to that, A great ball, and razz theres your almost guaranteed to catch anything. I caught a red circle Nidoking, in one ball with this technique.</TEXT>

You'll be able to hatch eggs collect stops, maybe hot a few gyms, and get new pokemon. Collect all the pidgey's and weedle's you can and use a lucky egg while evolving them and you will power level like crazy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, the idea is to drive to a new area every once in a while, and take a good long walk. I walked about 7-8 miles today, up and back along a walking trail, that goes through a pretty popular town center. Pok #232;stops are all along the trail. Made off with about 100 reg balls and 30 great balls and 20 ultra. Yeah, those damn Weedles get all sassy and wont stay in there balls, and more Pidgey's have run away than I would have liked, but honestly I'm glad the difficulty gets higher as you level up, other wise everyone who gets into the 20+ range would just level much more quickly otherwise. Im currently lvl 22.5 and I'm still completely addicted. Been walking every day at least 6 miles. Hatched around 6 eggs today and got an extra Ponyta for that sweet sweet candy. Struggling with server downtime was rough, especially when I wanted to make a full day of it, but I got that today, and it was awesome with the smooth servers. Although I am stubborn and refuse to let the game tell me I cant log in. I just constantly reload the app till it works, while holding the phone to my chest and attempting to Jedi Mind trick my way into the game. Edit: Minor Text Fixes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only pokemon worth putting in gyms are 1k+ cp. honestly I roll my eyes anytime I see a 300 in a gym. Unless its to simply collect coins or whatever. Catching as many pidgey's as possible as well as weedles is the most efficient way of power leveling. Stocking up on all their candies, popping a lucky egg, and evolving as many as possible until the timer runs out. I personally catch every pidgey I possibly can, I hate rattatta's though.. Way too much candy to evolve and itd take up too much space to focus on capturing all those rats as well as weedles and pidgeys. Theres calculators online that'll tell you exactly jow long itll take too evolve your stockpile and how much xp youd get for it. Edit: Minor Text Fixes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive lucid dreamed a lot, usually without trying. Most of the time Ill be in the middle of the dream and somehow realize I am asleep. My first course of action at that point is to immediately change the setting somehow, and then start flying. For some reason thats the only worthwhile thing I ever think of doing. Its also hard to control sometimes, like I may start to fall and have a hard tome righting myself, and I usually wake myself up before I hit the "ground." Although I am lucid some part of me still feels it is real. I don't lucid dream often, or perhaps I do. Its just upon waking up most nights I have no recollection of having any dream at all during the night. But when I do, I am almost always aware and can control it to an extent. How can I better remember I am dreaming? Also what other things could I do to control my dreams and not lose control of the dream?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just happened to stop watching right before the S6 finale. It worked out amazingly actually. I didn't see any marketing material or ads pretty much just hung out on Netflix. Not intentionally or anything Just kind of how it worked out for me. It just so happened the night of the premiere I was flipping through channels and saw it was on. I had to hurry and DVR it, it was only 5 mins in at the time. So while I waited I caught Myself up on the last episodes of S6 and watched the finale and was literally on the edge of my seat, heart racing couldn't blink. Ive never been so engaged in a television show in my life. I was emotionally primed for the premiere by that point and legitimately completely unaware who it could possibly be. When Rick had flash backs about all the memories of the different survivors I was so Distraught because Glenn was the first to flash through his mind. I thought it was him that was killed. But then they threw me off again after the second flashback, and made me start thinking Negan just straight up murdered them all. But I somehow knew they would never let that happen However I heavily suspected Abraham simply because of how badass he was carrying himself through the whole encounter and figured Negan would make him the example. So when he took the first hit I was somewhat ready. Then Daryl couldnt help himself but go all Daryl on Negan, and I was like "Daryl's a dead man." Was completely caught off guard when he just turned and struck Glenn like that. I actually jumped so hard and was completely shocked to the core, feeling scared and not wanting to believe it would be him, hoping maybe itd just be left at the initial hits. But when I saw the damage thatd already been done, my stomach dropped, and I instantly felt sick to my stomach. Truly an emotional rollercoaster of episodes. Though I am very glad for the way I experienced it and am very lucky that it happened that way. It preserved the surprise and avoided the feeling of just wanting it to get "over with."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was younger living in Dayton, OH there was a large flock of geese or something that would fly over our house around the same time every year. One of those times I was playing outside with my sister, and it just started raining shit. I will always fondly remember dodging all the poo, scrambling back to the house as quickly as possible and feeling like I was a superhuman for being able to avoid actually getting hit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just got accused of Stolen Valor.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-15 02:48:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was downtown at a fairly busy touristy area. I had to take my wife to a job interview at one of the airbrushing stands down there. She had to be there right after I got off work, and we were going to be going grocery shopping right after her interview since we just got paid, and the only Whole Foods is in that area. I went with her without having time to change into civvies. We loaded up our 3 month old and headed out. She walked over to the booth and I just sort of slowly walked down the strip with the stroller taking in all the tourist traps, as I had never really been there during the beginning of tourist season. The baby starts getting fussy so I stop and try and get her to take her pacifier, when I overhear a woman saying to her group  #8220;Thats not even an Air Force uniform! #8221; (We are authorized to wear OCP #8217;s at my base, or the Airman Combat Uniform (ACU) as we #8217;ve been told to refer to them since we obviously aren #8217;t the Army.) I just ignore it as I figure its just a curious person and continue to focus on my daughter. I then notice out of my peripheral the person walk away from their group towards me and hear a separate someone say  #8220;Hey no, don #8217;t... #8221; and I notice the person stops near me and kind of stands there. Which finally gets me to actually look up. This woman is standing like 6 feet from me with her phone out taking pictures of me. Confused, I sort of smile and look down at my daughter again. To which she says  #8220;You know stolen valor is highly illegal right? #8221; Shocked, I immediately reply,  #8220;Would you like to see my CAC Card? #8221; (I know... Common access card card) she then says  #8220;What you #8217;re wearing is stolen valor. #8221; I then dismissively said  #8220;Okay. #8221; and she turned and walked away back towards her group. I just went about my business and waited for my wife to finish her interview and we went to Whole Foods. I just keep thinking about it and how I maybe could #8217;ve handled it better, and am a little annoyed that someone would be so ignorant and not even consider to maybe try and talk to me before accusing. I realize people actually do commit Stolen Valor but I do think that you should proceed with caution before you straight up accuse someone. I don #8217;t get bothered easily by most things but this has been on my mind as it just happened a few hours ago.</TEXT>

These people who try to call people out and be on the highest of horses really put a bad taste in my mouth; especially when someone accuses someone falsely which happens more often than it should. Someone actually accused me of Stolen Valor one day while I was out with my infant daughter. It was one of the most irritating things I have experienced. I wont go into too much detail. Its in my post history if you are curious. People need to just live their lives and mind their business.</TEXT>

The piece shattered my driver side mirror and dented and scratched the top and driver side door of my vehicle. I filed an incident report with the manager on duty, notified police, however they did not want to write a police report as it was not a traffic incident, I just called corporate office with the number the manager gave me to report it to them, and the guy is going to get the report and get back to me. Pictures were taken of the offending metal structure and the damages done to my car. What can I expect? What am I looking at in terms of compensation? Should I get a lawyer? Edit: a word</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not me, my dad. His apartment got broken into the night before. His roommate would have  #8220;unsavory #8221; characters over sometimes while he was gone. Well one of them decided my dad had nice things and decided to take all of them. They used a crowbar to get in through the back door. That night he was unable to lock the door properly so he bought some of those magnetic door alarms where one end goes on the door, the other on the frame so when the door is opened it makes a loud siren noise; he affixed them in place with double sided tape as a temporary fix till he could properly fix it the next day. A few hours into the night he #8217;s had a few beers and falls asleep on the living room couch, only to be awakened to the very loud alarm blaring. He jumped out of his sleep screaming at the top of his lungs. Windmilling around the room a few times running straight towards the sound of the alarm, eyes half closed. Once he reaches the door, he finds that its still closed... The sensor had fallen off the frame and caused the alarm to go off. No one was there but him, and needless to say he felt pretty silly, albeit relieved.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[PS4] CLAN Recruitment // Ghost Chaserz // 75 Members // Lv. 2 (Since S4 Reset)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-09 14:08:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a weekly recruitment post from the Ghost Chaserz Gaming Community. We are more than just a CLAN, we are a community of like-minded gamers. We are still looking to fill the rest of our D2 CLAN since our MASS purge a couple weeks ago. We still have 25 spots available so come and claim one! We do everything when it comes to D2, so you will always be able to find a fireteam rather than using LFG. We have scheduled weekend raids, teams running trials, crushing teams in Gambit and we always have random Guardians running weekly milestones at all times during the week. We would like to have more PvP leads in the clan as we are running low on Top End skill for that department. We also have a good handful of GMT timezone players and always want more. We have a great new Raid Leader for the GMT time slot on the Raid weekends and enough for a Raid team but need a couple more for flexibility. But as always, all active members are encouraged to join just the same. We have a couple rules when it comes to our discord server and being active, but those are easy to follow. If this sounds like something you are interested in, then come join the family and be part of Ghost Chaserz. Just click on our [Bungie Recruitment Link](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/248418920) and follow the instructions to join our Discord server first and make sure that your Discord username matches your PSN. When all else fails, just get in the discord server and tag @Admin or @Officer to help you out with the process and our Admin team will help you with navigation. The Discord link is in our Bungie Recruitment post as well. Leave the Salt behind when you come! See you soon!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello everyone! My Wife and I started up our channel recently. Its been a long time coming after many false starts. We plan on making videos of our daily experiences and chronicling our journey through life with ourselves and our Daughter Ashton, and soon to arrive Daughter Ayla. Its been a crazy couple years and we hope to have some interesting content here in the near future. I am active duty Air Force, and have only been in for about 2 years now, so I plan on giving my perspective on an  #8220;older #8221; married persons take on enlisting and military life in general as well as other interesting topics. We have a few videos posted, I would appreciate you guys taking the time to give them a watch and leave a comment telling us what you think. I am always open to support the community of Small channels just getting started. We are excited to start this new chapter and see where life takes us. As for the question in the OP. The thing that I find I struggle with most with content creation is that I find it hard to remember to not exaggerate my personality and try to be myself in front of the camera. Its amazing how  #8220;Camera shy #8221; you can be even inside your own home in your comfort zone. I #8217;m sure as time goes on it will become more normal and I will learn to relax and be myself more while filming. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp8orgvY-akzWRTK5KO9M_w Check us out. Any advice or criticism is welcome. Welcome to our channel. I hope to see you there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take a look at it this way. If you fail youtube and end up in a  #8220;cringe compilation #8221; you will at least have gotten noticed for something, which may or may not bring in more views. There are thousands upon thousands of people uploading crappy videos (myself included) to YouTube everyday, so the likelihood of you being added to a fail compilation is very small, and even then it wouldn #8217;t be so bad. Use it to your advantage and embrace it. If you embrace your weaknesses and own them then no one can make fun of you for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have amblyopia caused by a significant difference in refraction between my eyes. My left eye is my good eye, my right eye is perpetually blurry at any distance whether I try to wear glasses or not. I went to the eye doctor last year or so, because I never knew what it was and I wanted to look into getting lasik to help my eye. The doctor told me that both my eyes are perfectly healthy. However I am far sighted in my left and near sighted in my right, and since the brain does not like to see 2 images, it favored the one that was more useful. My eye doesn #8217;t wander and you would never know if I don #8217;t mention it. It #8217;s a bit annoying, because I can #8217;t enjoy 3D movies like most people. However I never notice it until I close my left eye and try to see out of my right alone. Apparently eye patching can help train your brain to receive the signals but that only can take you so far as an adult. It is more effective when you are a child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree the NK shouldnt have been the final boss. However in the video the NK's death isnt the end. There is still Cersei to deal with. I see that in and of itself being another whole episode, With Cersei feeling as if she had won, only to be killed by Jaime in the end after thinking he is just going to do her bidding, kind of like the scene with Jon and Dany. As it is now, NK's death was very anticlimactic, and it made the whole WW threat seem like it was meaningless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my understanding anything massive can create gravitational waves, its only that they are so imperceptable that it takes something as massive as black holes colliding, (or in this most recent case what they think may be a neutron star colliding with a black hole) to emit ones large enough to be felt by LIGO. Think of a boat moving through water, it creates a wake, the same as the earth creates a wake in spacetime as it moves around the sun, those ripples are just very minor compared to the massive waves caused by black hole collisions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Before I had seen the movie I was scrolling through the comments of a completely non Star Wars related post. Someone had linked something in a normal unassuming comment and I clicked it. I was met with a very disturbing photo, of a naked man on all fours. He was only visible from the waist down from the perspective of someone standing over him to his rear. His spread butt cheeks and sack and booty hole on full display, and between his knees on the floor below him, was a piece of paper, with the words  #8220;Han Dies. #8221; By far the worst way I have ever had anything spoiled in my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Used to work at the Boeing Everett factory. They have big ceiling cranes going across the entire factory. I worked in wing body join. They would bring the wings in on the ceiling cranes and there would be spotters directly underneath, which I somehow always managed to be one. Our job was to line up the jack pads where the wings rest on. I always imagined that if the cranes failed and the wings dropped how fast would I be smushed to death? Or would I even have time to get out of the way.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve heard that about the schools, so I will definitely be trying to make sure they go to school on base. They #8217;re still pretty young and my wife stays home with them so there #8217;s still time. I #8217;ve heard the traffic going from west to east toward Honolulu is terrible.

    <TEXT>I bought a water filter pitcher called zero water when I lived in Everett, Wa, that supposedly filters out all dissolved solids in water, since I got it from the tap and am used to filtering tap water. The pitcher comes with a water testing meter to prove that it filters everything out. It measures the TDS (total dissolved solids) in the water and after filtering is supposed to read zero. When I tested the water before filtering, straight from the tap the reading was like, 25 or 30 depending on if the water was hot or cold. Moved to Florida, and tested the water here, and the reading was like 300-400. The water tastes terrible as well. My filters in Wa would last about 2 months, the ones here in Florida would go bad in about 2 weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me and my dad took our Labrador to a park. We put him in the bed of the pickup and leashed him to the truck while we drove down a short gravel path to the parking area so he could get some sniffs and stuff. We were driving very slow about 10 mph. Well buddy must #8217;ve gotten too excited and decided it #8217;d be a good idea to jump out, luckily my dad saw him hanging off the side, and stopped and quickly threw him back in the truck bed. Needless to say we never made that mistake again. The point is, even if they #8217;re tied down, you can not predict what the animal would do in these sorts of situations and it can be very dangerous. I would have been devastated if we didn #8217;t notice him hanging off the side, and I honestly don #8217;t know how long he was like that before we noticed him.</TEXT>
