    <TITLE>Is it possible to recover repressed memories? Horrible childhood events/entries found in my old tumblr account that I no longer remember.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Is it possible to recover repressed memories? I recovered my old tumblr about my childhood and there were horrible things narrated in there that I'm struggling to remember. I have a really strong feeling that I didn't make them up though, reading those entries made me feel angry. Like the emotions were so familiar but I really can't remember them. It was a tumblr I had when I was 12 years old. One entry there was me narrating how I witnessed my grandfather sexually harassed a cousin of mine when I was four. I talked about the guilt of not telling her that I saw what happened and that I remembered, but I was too scared to speak up. I even wrote there that I only realized that what my grandfather was doing to her was wrong when I was 10. I don't remember writing this, but I do remember writing a couple of things in that Tumblr account. And I don't remember what happened when I was four. There was another entry that talked about how my grandfather tortured my two cats right in front of me. He put them in a cellophane where they can't breathe and then he hammered them to death. I don't remember this too. It's been years since I last saw my grandfather because he's living far away from us with his new family. Guys, I don't know if I made them up. But I really have a strong feeling that I didn't! And it irks me so much to know that I've probably experienced a lot more without me remembering. How is this even possible???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love horror so much, and I really don't get disturbed easily that's why I'm so picky when it comes to horror movies that actually are terrifying and creepy, but this movie really is so disturbing, I can't put myself to open and pick up where I left off. Have you guys seen it? What do you think? Should I finish it or wait until I'm fully ready??</TEXT>
