    <TITLE>Any tips what to do against this? PvP - canon rush [replay included]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2010-08-12 13:40:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here is the replay. I was totaly overwhelmed during the midgame so there are a lot of mistakes (like my money skyrocketing, not building enough units, pylons, etc...). But beside the typical noobish errors, is there anything fundamental I could do better? http://www.sc2replayed.com/replays/55212-1v1-protoss-blistering-sands Edit: What I analyzed is: I shouldn't have gone for mothership, building cariers was probably a bad idea, I should have gone for colosus instead and I should have built more voidrays and phoenixes. Plus I total ommited upgrades for ground forces, that was a big hit too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any real bronze/silver level guides out there?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2010-09-05 18:16:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just lost 14 out of 16 games and I'm probably going to drop back to bronze soon (silver now). I need some real bronze/silver level guides. I have gone through Liquipedia, I watch Day9 (and Husky, HD, Psy, ....), I have gone through the official forums. The problem is that all this is as useful as someone telling me the best strategy for 120kg bench-press. I can't lift such weight anyway, so knowing the best strategy is totally useless. Edit: thx for the tips, I will look deeper into my replays and maybe post a few in /r/starcraftfeedback Edit: 5 most recent games here: http://www.reddit.com/r/StarcraftFeedback/comments/dac4q/silver_player_looking_to_improve_4gate_technique/</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you think that paedophiles should be jailed implicitly?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2010-09-23 21:57:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just read a post on a local server (not English) containing a long text from a paedophile (attracted to 12-16 age range). The legal limit in our country is 15 years. The reaction was pretty much what I expected from the regular site visitors, so I'm coming here with the same issue, to see the reaction here. Here's the link if you by some miraculous coincidence understand Czech language: http://www.abclinuxu.cz/blog/Anonymous/2010/9/zpoved-pedofila TO CLARIFY: I'm talking about "paedophile by law" type (I'm not sure now if the USA legal limit is 18 or 21). And I'm talking about sexual orientation, not child molestation, or rapes, or whatever. TLDR: Do you think that paedophiles (imagine some sort of involuntary test) should be jailed implicitly for their sexual orientation? Edit: This is actually very interesting. I wasn't expecting this kind of response. The response on the Czech server was very mild, but its nothing compared to this. And yes, I know that its not a paedophile but an ephebophile. I'm talking about the law viewpoint not the psychological viewpoint.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2012-05-27 15:25:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>The problem is that they too well rounded. When you have some legendary piece of equipment it should mean that the piece is legendary for some reason. Some made up example: ***The arrow splitter*** *The sword of a famous warior that was known for being able to dodge arrows by hitting them with his sword.* And such sword would have let's say +300 dex. That's a proper legendary. You don't hear legends about well rounded pieces of equipment. It's not like there will be a legend about a barbarian who was pretty strong, had good health, was pretty fast and his mind was bright.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The "demotion instead of death" approach in Path of Exile is much better then "perma-death" in Diablo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-08-21 10:58:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Playing hardcore, I noticed that I don't really have any negative feelings (apart from the typical "I'm so stupid" stuff) about loosing a hardcore character in Path of Exile. Loosing a character in Diablo feels really bad, cause he is dead and that's it. In Path of Exile, the character is demoted to default league and then usually immediately deleted by the player. The thing is, that this double-step process, where result of an error isn't death, but a demotion, which is then followed by a deletion by the player himself makes a huge psychological difference (at least for me). Loosing hardcore characters was always something that was keeping me off from the hardcore difficulty, even though I enjoy the play-style immensely. Diablo could learn some things from Path of Exile, cause while loosing a hardcore character is still painful, it's not off-putting.</TEXT>

I'm just confused by the fact that people got banned for something that I consider completely normal (and that's my personal view). I therefore would like some guidance in deciding what constitutes and exploit in the game, because I obviously can't make the judgement myself. The specific exploit I'm confused about is buying cooking ingredients using karma with the goal to vendor/trade the resulting craft for gold. Can someone please clarify why this is an exploit and what exactly I'm (not) allowed to do with the different in-game currencies?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to play a necro properly?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-09-06 22:00:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just can't wrap my head around my necro. I'm hitting a wall both in PvE (L60 doing L40 content) and PvP. My main problem is that I just don't know how to build up a synergistic build. The passives are all over the place. Healing synergizes well with toughness, but they are not together, power synergizes well with death shroud, but again I need to pick up a lot of worthless stuff to get them together. Going condition heavy makes death shroud sort of useless. I was also considering going for an all-round necro (power/leech/conditions/crit), but that really feels silly (but I will give it a go in PvP). What builds are you guys sucessfully using? I have a feeling that necros are also very gear dependent, so please post that as well (or at least combined stats).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK, so I have been playing Necromancer and I love the game, but let's just say that my Necromancer didn't live up to my expectations. So I'm wondering what should I roll for my alt. I would really like to choose a class that has some better mechanics (death shroud is incredibly boring). For example in one of the story quests I got transformed into a two-hand wielding monster and noticed that I can actually hit multiple mobs with one swipe. Does this work for warriors and guardian as well, or was it just a special effect for the quest? Also while I don't like generic casters, I'm really intrigued by the element switching system of elementalists, and the combo system (I never really looked into that since necros don't have many combo generators). So which class does demonstrate the Guild Wars 2 mechanics the best?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Official response clarifying the stance on mods from Gaile Gray (Support Liaison)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2012-09-22 01:03:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>**I'm reposting 1:1 to avoid any confusion, or misrepresentation. I only changed formating and removed the headers/footers of the emails.**  gt; gt; gt; gt; **From: Me**  gt; gt; gt; gt;Today I read a reposted answer from a support representative on Reddit.  gt; gt; gt; gt; quote: "Basically, anything that touches the game client in any fashion, including but not limited to visuals, overlays, controls, inputs, outputs, automation, sounds, or play experience is going to be referred to as a mod. The Guild Wars 2 software package is meant to be delivered and used AS-IS, with zero flexibility for the end user. If your script changes anything about the game itself, how it's displayed, or how it's played, then it's forbidden 3rd-party software."  gt; gt; gt; gt; Now, I'm really horrified by this, because this covers a lot of software that I'm using.  gt; gt; gt; gt; In particular this covers:  gt; gt; gt; gt; - any gaming grade equipment (mouses, keyboards, headsets, special equipment)  gt; gt; gt; gt; - any recording or streaming tools like Fraps or Xsplit  gt; gt; gt; gt; - any reasonable graphic card drivers (nvidia in particular)  gt; gt; gt; gt; - any overlay tools (Steam, Enjin, TeamSpeak)  gt; gt; gt; gt; I could go on.  gt; gt; gt; gt; So was this response meant seriously? Are really all these tools forbidden?  gt; gt; gt; gt; I'm actually using a dedicated Windows installation for games, just to avoid issues of this type, but it's really impossible not to violate such broadly defined rules.  gt; gt; gt; gt; So please could I get a clarification?  gt; gt; gt; **From: Gaile**  gt; gt; gt; This is a very interesting question, and I appreciate hearing your thoughts.  gt; gt; gt; As you are aware, we cannot approve or review or "vet" any third-party program; that is a given. However, our position is somewhat different than the one expressed in the GM response, so I've already contacted the team to be sure that everyone is on the same page.  gt; gt; gt; Our general statement is that anything that gives _advantage_ is forbidden. There are many utilities that help the player without taking a hit on others, without, for instance, being a detriment to the other players in a match. TexMod is one example of a program that doesn't really give anyone an _advantage_ over someone else. I've heard about certain programs that help disabled players, and those seem just fine, too. And of course there are others. We can't say "Sure, use this and that and that other thing" because that's tantamount to "approval," but we do recognize the distinction between advantage-giving programs and those that simply make it easier to play the game under specific circumstances.  gt; gt; gt; Thanks for pointing out that response. We'll get things clarified so that future responses are consistent with our policies.  gt; gt; **From: Me**  gt; gt; Could I get your permission to share this answer? Because I really believe that people would like to have this information.  gt; **From: Gaile**  gt; I think it's ok to share this. I just want to be very clear that:  gt; (1) we don't review or approve programs, and  gt; (2) programs can sometimes contain components that a legitimate player doesn't realize is a cheat element  gt; In the end, it's good to go VERY cautiously with the use of any third-party program, but we appreciate that there are definitely situations when a helpful, non-advantage-giving program is extremely beneficial to players. EDIT: Removed TL;DR to avoid confusion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's logical that no company would be willing to create a self-sustaining product (since there is only a finite amount of possible sales), but I find it weird that I haven't even heard about research or the military or non-profit companies heading for such products. To clarify what I mean by fully self-sustaining closed system: * a closed system with inputs in the form of energy and/or some raw materials producing some meaningful output (energy and/or materials and/or products) * a fully self-sustaining system that is capable of self-maintenance and self-repair (could be limited to some degree) Such systems would finally allow us to improve the **base** quality of life, since the output of such machine would be extremely cheap or free. Right now, we are rapidly improving the average quality of life, but the base is still pretty awful (well, not in most EU countries, since we have social insurance, but that's still pretty much nothing).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK, so this started when I read about a user loosing one of his Steam games. He inquired and apparently Steam removed it from his account. He wasn't even notified. Naturally I was shocked. So I wrote to Steam Support, and apparently I was also affected. They removed the "Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Season Pass" from my account. Now since this is a pre-order I really have no way of noticing this. If I wouldn't write to Steam support I wouldn't know until it would be released. So, if you have a Steam Account, there is a good chance that this happened to you as well. I didn't receive any notification of any sorts. The transaction was completely removed from my account and no longer appears in my Purchase History. If you only ever buy stuff on Steam and didn't redeem anything, you probably won't be affected (but I would check anyway if I were you).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do you own a console?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-01-05 21:40:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry for the length of this question. OK, so this is something that kept puzzling me for many, many years. In Central Europe not many people own a console and if they do, they bought it for party games (which is a use case that the PC can't really fulfill, even with the Steam Big Picture mode). What I'm really puzzled by is the wide spread of consoles in the US, some western EU states and Japan. Is it just marketing? Or why do you buy a console? Price definitelly can't be a factor, since after buying 2-4 games it levels of with a top-grade PC. I'm especially puzzled by people playing first person shooters on a console, because that just seems dumb. The controls are one more level removed, so the game has to be much slower paced and/or use some sort of auto-aim system. I personally understand getting a console for the following reasons: * party games (Wii is a perfect example) * exclusive games, or even series (japanese RPGs are a good example) * hacking the console (either free games, or other uses, since the HW is cheap) So why do you own a console? Why do you buy games for a console (especially first person shooters)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wanted to ask how you guys deal with translations between English and Czech. I usually don't have trouble translating from Czech to English, cause English is very context-heavy. By setting up the correct context I can usually reach the desired meaning easily. But translating from English to Czech, oh wow. I never perceived this before I had to translate some texts from English to Czech, but Czech seems incredibly connotation heavy. I usually really struggle with keeping the meaning and especially the tone of the text. In most cases I end up with a completely rewritten text.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Choosing a gaming mouse</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-03-10 20:04:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Approximately a year ago I bought Corsair peripherals (M90 + K90) and I seriously can't stand them. The hardware is so junky, I get phantom key-presses and scrolling, the side buttons on the mouse feel really bad and the software is horrible. So I decided to get rid of (at least the mouse) and buy something different. Unfortunately it seems that gaming mouses are currently undergoing some weird phase. What I can find are just very simple mouses or completely insane models. So, is there some solid mouse that would satisfy the following requirements? * heavy mouse * I'm just not able to be precise with a light mouse * software that will allow me to map push to talk to a mouse button * I found this to be a much bigger issue than I ever expected, most software won't allow you to map a key-down key-up events synchronized to a mouse button press-release * reasonably big and wide * some mouses are just to tiny for my hands * right-hand ergonomic * while some ambidextrous mice are OK, I would prefer an ergonomic right-hand mouse * Linux capable * I don't really need the crazy macros in Linux, but the mouse must work without the software as a solid mouse Some extra stuff that would be nice: * programming stored inside the mouse * it would be great if the mouse would have hardware configuration that would be persistent, not just when the mouse software is running</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is here anyone who managed to get a root partition on a raid mirror with EFI grub? I'm trying different layouts and the only thing I get is that the layout is not compatible with the bootloader (openSuSe 12.3). EDIT: I have done it, see the solution below. **The solution:** * create a layout where you have a non-raid, non-lvm /boot/efi * create an empty counterpart on the other disk * create a /boot that is non-lvm (can be raid) * create the othe partitions (root, home, swap, etc...) * let the install do it's work * clone the /boot/efi using dd * `dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1` * add an efi record for the clone * `efibootmgr -c -g -d /dev/sdb -p 1 -L "opensuse" -l '\EFI\opensuse\grubx64.efi'` * using `efibootmgr --bootorder` change the boot order so that the two opensuse records are next to each other</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Genuinely curious, how would you improve Bioshock?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-04-08 06:10:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm kind of puzzled by the critique of Bioshock (not just from TB), because it usually mentions things that I hate, but which I haven't perceived at all in the game. For example, the two guns limit. For me it felt the same way like the Vigor selection. You only have two selected, but since there are so many guns laying around (that felt thematic) you basically have every gun at any point. Thinking back, it of course wasn't true, but it felt that way. The weapon re-skins felt very thematic. These are vox populi weapons, they are modified versions of the base weapons. So they must use the same parts, they just behave differently (scopes, firing modes). I did the 1999 difficulty on my first play through, without buying anything from the dollar stores. So that probably helped with the simple difficulty in the game (yeah that's one huge flaw of the game, the difficulty is incredibly low). I have trouble imagining the game with different mechanics. How would the game work with non-hitscan weapons? I don't think that would be compatible with the sky-lines and the whole dynamic feel of the combat. I don't know, the critique sort of feels like "There isn't enough meat in this fruitcake!". So realistically, how could the game be improved?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It changes your approach a lot, you approach everything more methodically and slowly, since one shot from a shotgun can take your shield and most of the health. As far as close combat goes, it is actually sometimes preferable (especially with the right gears equipped). The Skylines are mostly used as an escape/positioning mechanism, since you will get shot a lot if you don't go fast enough. As far as the speed goes, the big battles are slowed down quite a bit, since you can't just dive into them. You need to methodically eradicate the right enemies in the right order (especially in the arena fights). The big fights are also a lot about pacing your salt/ammo consumption, since most of these fights are actually multi-staged and if you are as bad shot as me, you will run out of ammo a lot. In essence some of the fights feel much more like a puzzle than a shooter, which is what the old games felt like. Unfortunately it's not exactly as the old games, because you still find insane amounts of consumables and ammo everywhere (even without exploring much).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are there any alternatives to CoD?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-07-03 15:37:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, there is always a lot of trash talk about CoD (only for noobs, destroyer of PC first person shooters, etc...). But are there any proper alternatives to CoD? Black Ops 2 is my first CoD and I really have trouble coming up with another fast paced first person shooter that isn't sniper heavy or completely dead. * Blacklight Retribution has great mechanics, but the maps favour snipers a lot and it's a bit too expensive for my taste (time or money) * Tribes Ascend was fun for a time, but this game is meant for pre-made groups with voice chat * Gotham City Impostors is really great, but mostly dead * Team Fortress is ok, but it never really clicked with me * Counter Strike isn't really my cup of tea (although arms race is sort of ok) So, are there any other first person shooters with active player base (EU) that I missed?</TEXT>

Plus I wouldn't mind a better weapon system (although I'm sure that nothing will approach the quality of Blacklight Retribution).</TEXT>

Yes you should avoid deep multiple inheritance and especially, you should try to avoid having data on the bottom of your inheritance tree.

    <TEXT>Why are you making the game so big from the start? Just make a 1v1 edition with the four preconstructed decks, or even an edition with just 2 preconstructed decks (in two variants, so you still cover everything). I honestly don't have time to go through it in detail, but the first perception is that it's a VS card game, and that for 40 USD is bit much (for an unestablished brand). For now drop the deck customization part completely, because however you present that, it will always seem like it's required and that makes the game much less appealing (you can't just put it on the table and play).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That depends on what you are talking about. If you are talking about the value of money, then indeed, it means that you can buy less for the same value. But that wouldn't make much sense here, since there is no money inflation involved. What is indeed deflating is the value of the cards (you are treating the cards as the currency in this case).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, you can include MIT licensed stuff inside of CC-BY-SA, the same goes for CC-BY (also can be included in CC-BY-SA work). You cannot license something that includes CC-BY-SA work as MIT (as you yourself noted). And you cannot license something that includes CC-BY-SA work as GPL because CC-BY-SA forces attribution-only license on the whole work (GPL requires much more). For proof of this, just check the license compatibility, is specifically states that you cannot include CC-BY-SA in a CC-NC-SA work (you cannot add further restrictions). I am actually talking about non-code create works. The issue with those is the hazy area of what is derivative work. For example a game using CC-BY-SA music is most likely OK, a game using CC-BY-SA graphic assets can be considered derivative since the game would have to change significantly if those assets were changed (but then again if we have something like Minecraft that supports skin packs, it's probably OK).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The simplest way to look at it is that syntax represents structure, how things need to be laid out to make structural sense. Semantics represent meaning. For example take the negative sign: "-". Both "10-20" and "-30" are syntactically correct, but "-;" isn't because it doesn't match the expected structure. If we look at semantics, we will find out that "10-20" and "-30" have very different meanings, in "10-20" the negative sign is a binary operator, taking two parameters, in "-30" it is an unary operator, taking one parameter. The differences can actually be much bigger, for example: "2\*x" and "\*p_test" are both syntactically correct, but the first one will in most cases semantically represent multiplication of 2 and the value stored in variable x, the second one will (in C/C++) most like semantically represent a dereference of the pointer, stored in variable p_test. There are further complications as there are actually different semantics for floating point arithmetics and integer arithmetics and we didn't say what type of variable x is. Syntax is usually easy to check, as it tends to be closely contained. Semantics are much more complex, as they change with context and you may need to go quite deep to determine what the context actually is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was talking specifically about the "you get money for votes" part. I'm actually not sure if companies can donate money to parties, but people definitely can. Even if they couldn't, parties still get money from their members (quite a lot actually). Also this model encourages the existence of smaller parties, since your vote has dual purpose. One, you are voting for the policies this party represents, but you are also directly monetarily supporting the party. This way parties can continue to exist and do their work. I voted for the pirate party for this exact reason, they do very good work in watching and commenting on proposed laws (and publicising any screw-ups in these laws).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, ok let's take the typical situation I get into in almost all games. * turn one, I face check, this ends up rezzing one ICE * turn two, the corp plays money cards and puts one more ICE in front of the one rezzed Now I'm screwed. If I run on the server with two ICE the corp has no incentive to rez it, since the already rezzed one will kick me. I need to go for my rig, at least a sentry breaker and whatever the rezzed ICE is. While I'm doing this I can't run, because 1) I need money and 2) until I have a sentry breaker I can't run to lose my partial rig.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem I run into is that I have an SMC, but I still can't run, because I don't have enough credits to use the SMC and pay for the breaker. The two extra credits and a click is a lot in early game. Test run is nice burst, but that leaves me in negative for the next turn. This is sort of the dilemma cycle I'm in. I can put down the tools, but then I don't have the money to run, or I don't put down the tools, but then I have money but not the tools to run. Especially when I'm running Magnum Opus as economy. That's just such a huge tempo hit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Sure gamble** It just doesn't work in shaper decks. Shapers are heavily click constrained and what ends up happening is that you just waste click on digging for your sure gambles. I still need to somehow address this draw issue (no idea how), but drawing cards is a big problem, as it slows you down a lot. **Multiple copies of cards** I tried it, but it was super inconsistent. You either have a 60 card deck, or you need to cut your SMCs and Test runs and then you just end up drawing multiple copies of the card you already have. The game just devolves into coin flipping :-/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem is the amount. I stopped playing PvZ2 once they pushed harder on the microtransactions (and have sort of given up on this game ever coming to PC), so I can speak about other games only, but the equivalent of 10 USD in-game money is generally something like 20 hours of adds. And you generally need coins to play the game as a "normal" game, and 10 USD worth of coins generally enough for 2-4 days.</TEXT>

Before the change, I couldn't even connect to a game, it would just endlessly load the level and then kick me out.

    <TEXT>1. generally for what I am doing, the disk subsystem is the bottleneck (compilations, analyzing lots of data, etc...), NVMe would be a big price jump and I haven't seen any workstation/desktop usage reports 2. Yeah, it's essentially subset of Nvidia G-Sync functionality built into the standard (should have much wider adoption across monitors), so I'm kind of wondering whether to just salvage an old GPU card and wait for the adoption of adaptive sync, or buy something new now. 3. damn, that's not good, I need to mix Windows and Linux usage :-/ 4. I was generally planning going Raid 10, which is stripes on top of mirror, or mirror on top stripes (can never remember which one), you need 4 drives for it.</TEXT>

Well, the king refused and then the entire Europe went crazy. Everyone attacked Rostislav while being hostile to the revolt. Is this some sort of game mechanism?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are there any significant differences between the architecture of AMD and NVidia GPU Cards from the computational perspective (through OpenCL or CUDA)? I have gone through informational materials for NVidia and AMD cards and it seems that while they present the architecture in very different manner it seems to be almost identical. Are there any significant differences apart from cache sizes, warp sizes, etc...? Disclaimer: Yes I know that OpenCL works on both AMD and NVidia cards and is not just limited to GPU cards. Yes I know that CUDA is only for NVidia cards. No I'm not asking about a comparison between CUDA and OpenCL. No I'm not asking about specific cards, I'm asking about the current architectures. No I don't want help with selecting a GPU card. Yes I'm desperate, I have already put way to much time into getting this answered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, some games already do this (although in a super trivial way - matching flight stick movement in game) and that already is huge immersion factor. Occulus is already using tracking for the head, so I don't see a problem with tracking the hands as well (all you need is markers on your hands). The only issue is the physical buttons, but there are actually plenty of universal programmable button panels, that are used for precisely this type of application (reconfigurable interfaces).</TEXT>

There is also a strong correlation between the metrics that decide who gets cheap/free stuff from the government and the way this particular ethnic group lives. So generally non-Roma families will find it hard to get cheap/free stuff from the government since they will rank lower on the priority lists.

    <TEXT>Because a package of sites isn't a special service. Yeah it need to be more descriptive, we don't know what a special service is. But without allowing special services, you couldn't have mobile internet providers (they couldn't give voice higher priority than internet - btw. that's inherent in the protocols used), you couldn't bundle TV and Phone services (over IP) with internet connection, since those need dedicated virtual lines. So unless you would have distinction on the physical layer (like cable companies have, with different frequencies used for different purposes), you couldn't do any of these services.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Troubleshooting issue with unresponsive java applications</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-06 12:48:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm having issues with java applications being completely unresponsive on my machine. This started happening after I upgraded to OpenSuSe Tumbleweed. The mystifying thing is that I'm running two other machines with the exact same version of OpenSuSe Tumbleweed and none of them have this issue. Moreover, for some applications (Netbeans), the problem disappears if I pin the process to a single CPU core, or if you attach `strace` to the running process. If I use remote X from the problematic machine (the application running on the problematic machine, displayed elsewhere), the problem does not seem to manifest either. The main difference between the machines is the hardware. The problematic machine has a more powerful 6 core i7 (2 core i5 on the non-problematic machine) and an NVidia 970 GPU (Intel GPU on the non-problematic machine). I have tried both OpenJDK and OracleJava and both seem to manifest this issue. Once stuck the process does not respond to anything (tried `CTRL+\`, tried `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` etc...). I'm mainly interested in ways how I could possibly troubleshoot this problem and narrow it down to the cause.

    <TEXT>I hate you Davey for putting me through this experience. It took me a bit to understand fully what I have done, but now... I really hate myself. I don't think that I should have been affected this much a by a game (or an interactive art piece to be precise), but you are an asshole that made me feel like a piece of shit. For those of you that have not yet figured out what this game is about, it's about opening yourself to someone and that someone trampling over all the boundaries that you have established. In this "game" you are the one betraying the trust and trampling over the boundaries with the help of Davey. It starts innocent enough. You are going through the creations of Coda. Now, let's ignore the fact that you shouldn't have access to this at all, because this is something that Coda shared with Davey and it's Davey who is giving you access to this creation. As you go along you (and Davey), keep trampling over the boundaries that are implicit in each of the levels. You reach the doors that should never been reached, you do not earn the privilege of leaving your cell, you leave the house cleaning cycle by breaking it... It is subtle, but you are breaking the boundaries that have been established by the creator, to reveal things that should not have been revealed (does "Press Enter to remove all the walls" seem familiar?). It becomes very explicit once you reach the machine level. Coda is screaming at you that you destroying his work. You are shooting and erasing all of it. YOU ARE! And here we are at the end. Davey has broken the final boundary. Even with Coda not releasing any more games, Davey manages to break the last boundary by sharing this private insight into Coda's life with other people. We are in the last game of Coda. We break through the unbeatable maze, we smash the "almost" random code, we remove the puzzle that cannot be beaten. Now, only now, when we break the last possible personal boundary, we get what we deserve. Coda is breaking contact with us. We have broken all boundaries that were to be broken so the only way Coda could ever survive is to withdraw, break contact. The shitty part is that the "player" is put into the role of the one breaking all these boundaries. We, the players are the horrible assholes that force Coda to stop making games. We are the ones that break all the boundaries. While Davey opens the doors for us, we are the ones going through the open doors. It is our curiosity that destroys Coda and his work. It doesn't matter whether Coda is real, whether Coda is Davey, or whether Coda is female. We are the assholes that are destroying this creative soul by analyzing it and breaking all the boundaries, until there is nothing left.</TEXT>

Which is the really horrible part, as in real life, you don't get to play through your interactions again. The second point is that it actually doesn't really matter whether Coda is real or not. I mean, it is kind of comforting that you are not really hurting a real person, but you still did all these things, so...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The game is about opening to another person and that person trampling over all the boundaries that were established. In this game, it is Coda opening to Davey, sharing his games. You are put into the role of the perpetrator, you get to see things you were not meant to see, while Davey keeps putting lampposts into the games by forcing his interpretation of what the game means upon you. You are told that you are meant to see what is hidden behind the wall, you are meant to reach the doors that are not meant to be reached, that you should escape the loop of house cleaning, etc... If you look at the games Coda is making, you will realize that they escalate very quickly, with the last few game being very clear. You the player are destroying Coda and his work, literally. The last game, is a breakup letter, but even here, there is hope on Codas part. To actually get to the break-up part, you need to brute force both the annoying maze and the random number, you also need to solve the unsolvable puzzle, you need to break the game. Only then you get to the final conclusion. I suspect that the game was created to make players feel bad and wrong about playing it, but since the story teller is so forceful, it is a bit hard to get the meaning out of the games themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, Steam is DRM. It is also a digital distribution platform. I do remember the physical distribution age and I would not switch back for anything. You were also always only licensing the game you were buying. Because it's not a physical product you are buying. The same goes for music, films, etc... As for the "only on Steam" thing. That's a marketing agreement, not a technical vendor lock-in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Opening yes. And there are many replacements. .Net, Java, D, Rust, Go. But they never replaced C++. Why? Well, because you cannot create something as flexible and high-performance as C++ without copying C++ issues. The development of C++ has been slowed down by its legacy, but if you ever touched scripting languages, you should be shouting thank god. I'm exhilarated that I can write a standard conformant code now and have it work 5 years later without any issue. We have code bases that only work with old versions of Ruby, so we have to custom compile old Ruby for current systems, because there is not enough man-power to rewrite the code for newer versions (it changed so much).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have just failed mine (several quick deaths lead to several very important wars ending inconclusively and now I'm dealing with a huge revolt). I could recover, but seriously I can't be bothered... I need to approach it in completely different way. The biggest problem were vice-royalties. They keep flipping to non-vice-royalties somehow and then I can either choose to have everyone hate me a bit, because I revoked a title, or the title holder hate me a lot, because I'm granting vice-royalties. Also I have no idea how to actually conquer Italy. It takes ages. in 1000 AD i got ~40 percent of what I needed in Italy. EDIT: so yeah, I need a restart. I got a great holy war and two holy wars during the big revolt that lasted for 40 years (cause, other countries kept attacking and holding the rebels land). I don't think I can recover, Abbasids keep wrecking my armies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The important thing here is that since we do make distinction between formal/informal forms, we generally treat the English "you" as formal/plural (which it technically is anyway). So in single-sentence translations you will find you translated into formal "vyk #225;n #237;", instead of informal "tyk #225;n #237;". Only with additional context will "you" be translated into the informal form.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much what GPU compute people have known for a long time. AMD had always more raw power, but it was only available when we wrote code for a specific card. NVidia with CUDA allows relatively generic code to run at very high utilization as long as you don't get stuck on memory bandwidth. The internal scheduler is smart enough to switch between kernels efficiently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much. For the right tasks, GPUs are incomparably faster then CPUs (upto several hundred times speed up), which brings a lot of offline computation into the on-line feasibility area. Now you can do real-time visualization or processing of data that you could only do on big supercomputers on a single GPU card. Consoles don't really benefit from GPU offloading as their primary purpose is to render games (which will make the GPU busy), but for example image and video manipulation software can utilize GPU cards to do real-time processing (filters, compression,...) that would previously take several seconds/minutes to process per-frame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but the thing is that you only need to overlay this if the base utilization of your compute units is low. It is kind of like hyperthreading. Hyperthreading only adds overhead if you are utilizing all physical cores at max. The benefit of hyperthreading is that you can run more semi-idle threads than without hyperthreading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been struggling with autotools for the longest time, it is probably my most hated tool. Mainly because I just can't get into it. All tutorials deal with something completely trivial, the documentation doesn't really help and all real-life automake setups are completely incomprehensible to me. So can someone explain this particular autoconf script, line by line? http://icedtea.classpath.org/~ebaron/webrevs/krb5-default-ccache/02/common/autoconf/build-aux/krb5.m4.html In particular, the magic variables, magic syntax ([] after fi, dnl at certain points at the end of lines, etc....)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the answer. My problem is that you are again quoting the documentation without telling me what it means in this context. I know that `dnl` means discard the rest of the line, but then it makes no sense to put it at the end of the line. Or is it an autoconf equivalent of escaped newline used in bash (`\` at the end of the line)? What about the magic variables used across the macros? I know what the main `AC_XXX` blocks do, because they are documented, but I have hard time understanding the meaning of the code.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hehe, look at Computer Science. People publish results, if you ask how they got them, they will tell you that it was using a prototype they throw away after they generated the results and even if they had anything, they couldn't give it to you. So you basically can spend 3-12 months re-implementing everything or, just ignore their research. This is what just killed my PhD. I crossed paths with another research group and therefore needed to build on top of their work to get published, but for that I needed to re-implement everything they done in the last 4 years. Current research practices are complete nonsense. Pretty much impossible to publish anything actually significant (my best rated paper is actually a short commercial blurb for our institution, that's insane).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm truly struggling with calorie counting... no results after a month</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-02 20:44:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been very diligent about counting calories, and I exercise each day, and yet somehow it does not seem to work out for me. I'm using Fitbit for my calories expense counting and Lose it for tracking my calorie intake. They both claim I should be \~1300 kcal in deficit each day, but I'm losing weight very slowly (not even sure if I'm actually loosing weight, since my weight jumps +-2kg each day) and if anything I seem to be loosing muscle mass over fat. So my conclusion is some of the tracking is wrong. I kind of trust Lose it, as food nutritional information should be pretty solid. However I also kind of trust Fibit as it's the most conservative tracker I have ever used (most other trackers report 1.5-2x the number of calories spent). What could be the issue? It has been one moth so far. Should I just give it more time? I have been very tired lately, even with excessive amount of coffee keeping me alert, plus if I push myself during my exercise sessions, I definitely feel it the next day, which just add to the heap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a very strange problem with these routers. They work perfectly, except, I can't connect my phone to the wifi, because then it will stop downloading updates (and install new apps). Everything else on the phone works great, I even gets speeds of 600Mbit+ when connected to the wifi, it is just android apps that fail to download. And it is 100% the router, because the downloads work perfectly on alternative WIFI and also on mobile connection.

    <DATE>2020-05-28 14:43:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not quite sure what kind of PC does the wireless kit require but on i7-9700K (which I would consider up to date and high end) the impact on performance is just massive. My frame times jumped from 4.5ms to \~7ms with massive jitter, frequent re-projection and regular longer lags causing sound / tracking drop-outs. I had to go to back to a wired setup for the time being. It doesn't seem to be signal based, as the app keeps showing full bars. I have absolutely no idea how to approach debugging this / figuring out what is causing such bad performance. Can this conflict with my WiFi perhaps?  #8203; EDIT: Solved, see comments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so I managed to mitigate the problem (mostly), there is still a pretty big impact, but without the jitter (I still have other issues). It was OBS, apparently game capture conflicts with the way the wireless card grabs the frames. Fortunately I only care about the 3rd person view, so capturing the screen is good enough. However I'm a bit worried, since I want try LIV soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been continualy making upgrades to my VR setup with the assumption that it is the hardware that is lacking. However, I need to conclude now that it's not the hardware, but it's SteamVR that is lacking. * I need to reset my floor position every time I start VR, it's off by +/- 20cm * It's common for SteamVR to decide to adjust my floor position mid-game as well. * Tracking is bad, I mean really bad, even with 4 tracking stations: * controllers randomly loosing tracking and flying into distance * jittery movement, even when moving the controllers slowly * intermittent strange tracking lag (I think it looses tracking, but manages to re-engage a few frames later) * restarting the headset  amp; steam VR sometimes helps if I'm having massive tracking issues, sometimes it doesn't, there is no way to get rid of the intermittent problems * even with large performance headroom, there are many weird hitches and glitches, where SteamVR just drops couple of frames for no apparent reason (I have no idea how to debug this), sometimes this also causes the tracking to completely drop out or go mental My headset is Vive Pro, I replaced the cable, tried Wireless, upgraded my room, switched to 4 tracking stations and upgraded my PC. At this point, I'm starting to think that if you want to play VR games, Quest might really be the only usable hardware right now.</TEXT>

Play 90  amp; 360 maps, play maps with crazy custom walls (they look much better in 1st person).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please do an update once you go through the testing. I have been having massive issues with 4 trackers. From my testing it seems to happen when one of the trackers has bad vision to the wand (slightly obscured, or just distance). I think it's a bug in Steam VR where the tracking calculation does not correctly converge in the presence of bad data (e.g. the one bad tracker should get ignored), but instead it diverges.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I couldn't handle 1200, I average \~1800 with the goal being bellow 1600 every day (yeah, some days it's just not possible). My main thing is finding foods that are satisfying. I swing towards the keto range of foods, as in, I need significant amount of fat in my food to feel full. These are my favourite snacks * cottage cheese (I don't know why it makes me feel full, based on the content, but it works for me) * greek yogurt + marmelade (this is substantial snack, but I realized that marmelades have actually reasonable amount of calories \[at least some of them\] and 50g is enough for one cup of yogurt) * crackers \[not sure if that's the proper english word\] (as a bread replacement, they tend to be \~40kcal per cracker)</TEXT>

I think you will need to mod your wireless, it overheats and starts crashing after \~20 minutes with my Vive Pro. I never felt the need to switch the lenses. Be glad that you didn't go with the Cosmos. I just got it as a second headset and it's going back to the shop tomorrow. Insane chromatic abberation, the tracking is weirdly laggy (it kept making me sick), bright objects leave massive trails.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-26 22:11:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm looking for an app with either a good quality food database for Europe or an easy way to add new items locally. Below is my experience with Lose It: The quality of the food database is complete trash. 95% of the items are measured in portions (which is completely nonsensical for raw items), most fruit is measured in volume (yeah I will have 200ml of strawberries today). This would be fine if entering new items worked without issues. The scanning of nutritional information almost never works, the thing again defaults to 1 portion, so I need to switch things around every time. It even seems to struggle with recognizing barcodes that I previously manually entered. I have been using it for over 100 days in a row, but I'm so fed up with it's becoming a hindrance to my weightloss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been looking around, but so far my search has been fruitless. It seems that all the load balancing and sharding is oriented towards simple stateless backends or HTTP front-ends. I pretty much need both sharding and sticky load balancing (for different components), but both need to be based on custom hash / field in gRPC request. All of our backend is in C++. Anyone has experiences with this, or some resources I could follow?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-10 18:01:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have complained about this multiple times, and I think this is the last time I'm posting about this, because I spent so much money and energy to make this work that it's time to call it failure. * I started with VIVE Pro with 2 trackers. The tracking was pretty bad. * I switched to 4 trackers, I would say that the tracking got a bit worse, but it's very hard to tell. * I switch my PC, no change. * I covered my entire room in greenscreen fabric, no change. * I tried Cosmos Elite, the tracking was horrible even in the headset, while the Vive Pro will jump a bit from time to time, the Cosmos kept being very floaty, making me immediately sick. * I cracked my controllers on the new Beat Saber song pack, so I bought new ones, no change. * One of the base stations went to red light mode, so I replaced it, making the tracking again a bit worse (but it's hard to tell). My controllers keep spazzing out and flying into the distance from time to time. It's not unusual for the controller to completely disappear. I even had a case, when the controllers swapped hands. The headset itself with "jump" from time to time (instant change in position). If anyone knows how to debug these issues (other then the typical bulshit like mirrors and bad USB ports), I would be eternally grateful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Considering that gRPC just uses HTTP as a wrapper, I never imagined you could manipulate the HTTP part of the communication. But yes, there is this method on the ClientContext that does indeed seem to do that: [https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc\_\_impl\_1\_1\_client\_context.html#a723eca3a227cffa120108e3fce01c230](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc__impl_1_1_client_context.html#a723eca3a227cffa120108e3fce01c230) This is very cool. So I assume you just handle gRPC as plain HTTP traffic (I don't quite get what you mean by the host name to include everything you need, what would the host name have to do with anything).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, right. Hmm, I guess it's a tradeoff. I could hash the interesting bits and just have \`hash.layer1-service\` and \`another-hash.layer2-service\`. But that way I can't really adjust the load balancing on the fly, since the hashing logic needs to live in the client service, adjusting this would mean pushing a new binary. OK, I will shop around for an HTTP load balancer. I was looking at Envoy and HAProxy so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing that consistently seems to be affecting my tracking is the system load. Now I run my system very hot, Beat Saber - gt; 4K capture into LIV - gt; 4K capture into OBS - gt; Stream / Record and I run into tracking issues with this a lot, especially when streaming (recording, even in 4K seems to be easier on my machine than a 720p stream). However, decreasing the capture resolution into LIV did drastically improve my tracking and especially completely eliminated the cases when a saber would completely disconnect.</TEXT>
