    <TITLE>Dog dildo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 23:37:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>We have a toy for our dog that looks like very much like a dildo, which has inevitably led to some interesting situations. We didn #8217;t buy it for ourselves, because my parents are not the type to purchase a dildo-looking dog toy. We acquired the cursed dog toy from my painfully oblivious grandparents who handed it to my parents, with no context whatsoever, saying only  #8220;it was too big for Rascal. #8221; (Rascal is their dog) Its a rubbery, blue dog toy that looks incredibly like a dildo, but my grandparents say it #8217;s a chew toy for toothpaste I believe. This weekend, my dad brought his friends over, and they brought their dog so she could hang out with our dog. They looked into the living room to find their dog chewing on the toy, and one of them turned to my mom saying,  #8220;I think she, uhm, broke into the bedroom... #8221; whilst her husband said rather loudly,  #8220;I think Sadie got to your dildo!! #8221; Cue my 10 year old sister asking me,  #8220;What #8217;s a dildo?? Why would that dog toy be in mom and dad #8217;s room? #8221; while my parents had to explain to their friends that it was not, in fact, a dildo, just a toy that had been purchased by my oblivious grandparents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>some girl fuckin FLEW over a table like some sorta parkour shit or something. She started on one bench seat and hurled herself over the table and started beating some other girl. This resulted in a ton of blood on the ground, one of the girls having both her earlobes ripped, and the guidance counselor getting bit on the arm. Fun times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yeah this one time all the power went out the whole day and wouldn #8217;t come back on. The WiFi was down and most of our work was on our computers so we couldn #8217;t really do anything. They kept us in school. Two of the portable classrooms caught fire. They still made us stay at school. Nothing was accomplished that day and I wound up sitting in the bathroom dressed up like big bird (it was a spirit day or smth) instead of going to class.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. It should definitely be offered because many people really enjoy it and it #8217;s good for them, but for others it #8217;s just not their thing and self expression comes in other ways. I #8217;ve also noticed that art classes, mainly in elementary/middle school and sometimes high school, focus mostly on drawing, painting, and coloring, but there are many other ways to make art such as jewelry or sfx makeup that people may prefer.</TEXT>
