    <TEXT>just did an all nighter, i #8217;m so fucking tired of doing this shit. is university just hard or am i a procrastinating piece of shit? idk sometimes i #8217;ll work all day and all night and still feel like the work i #8217;m putting out is bullshit. i need to stop thinking so much about how other people perceive me, because they won #8217;t even fucking know me in five years. but it #8217;s hard. i almost killed myself cuz of school and these fucking expectations i put out for myself and what other put out for me. i #8217;ve always been depressed but fuck this shit is on a different level. i have never hated myself more before going to this school. so looking forward to taking this next semester off. gonna go to therapy and have more time for myself. fucking tired of this shit.</TEXT>

I #8217;m really fucking trying but it #8217;s almost like everything is working against me. sorry for the rant  #128517;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>might #8217;ve failed a class but who cares</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-18 16:23:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>after possibly the worst summer semester of my life i finally submitted my final requirements for this class (a class that went a week longer than the school summer semester schedule...yay). felt like shit the whole time so my work was shit and i #8217;m trying hard not to let feelings of self loathing and self doubt creep into my mind. so now i #8217;m just trying to say to myself *fuck it, if i failed, i failed. i can take the class again* i #8217;m trying to disassociate my mind from these negative feelings. luckily i #8217;m taking the fall semester off cuz i really need the break. like deadass, i would #8217;ve probably tried to kill myself if i kept going. and since i #8217;m in grad school i need at least a B to pass and i really don #8217;t think my work is B material but again, WHATEVER AMIRIGHT... ...it #8217;s just hard to be the worst out of a bunch of talented people :/ not feel like the worst BE THE WORST. this is partially why i #8217;m dying to graduate. so i never have to see these people again and i never have to worry about what they think of me. i never have to give a presentation, hear feedback, and cry for the next hour because i #8217;ll never be a good student/architect. i spent the last 6 years of my life being criticized and put down by teachers and jurors that the external validation that i have needed to feel worthwhile has long been gone. and i know that this is the whole point of school,to be criticized and try to learn from it, but FUCK i feel like a piece of shit. like, every school year i feel worse and worse about myself. i really am looking forward to the break at least. hopefully then i won #8217;t feel like such a failure when i get back. what i really want to do at the bottom of my heart is to drop out but that #8217;s unreasonable. i have a year left after i get back and it #8217;s too close. everyday i smack myself because i should #8217;ve dropped like 3 years ago but fuck me, i didn #8217;t want to disappoint my parents. and now look at me. now i #8217;m disappointing my teachers and i still feel like a piece of shit  #128512;. it #8217;s like no matter what i #8217;ll always be a disappointment. but whatever i guess. i can always retake the class...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>all i wanted was a hug</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-19 23:09:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now don #8217;t get me wrong, i love my mother and i think she #8217;s the strongest person i know. but she is a devoted christian while i #8217;m a non-believer which can make things difficult when i go to her for comfort. just recently i just wanted a hug because hugs make me feel good. after the hug she immediately went on a spiel about how reading scripture always helps her out her mind at ease (i #8217;ve been having a really rough time with school and depression for the past couple of weeks and it #8217;s to the point that i #8217;ve had to reach out to her for a lifeline). like ok, i get it, that #8217;s how she finds comfort in her troubles (she #8217;s had colon cancer and is now recovering from breast cancer, when i say my mother is the strongest person i know i really mean it) but i #8217;m sorry i just don #8217;t believe in a higher power. so whenever she tries to make me feel better i #8217;m just standing there looking at the wall like a dumb fuck cuz i don #8217;t want to hurt her and be like  #8220;this isn #8217;t helping mother #8221;. there #8217;s a little part of me that wonders if trying to believe in a higher power would help and i tried reading some psalms and i #8217;m sorry it #8217;s just not for me. i wish my mother would understand that insisting that i read the bible out loud and feel the  #8220;transformation that the words give #8221;. idk shit real weird i guess. i also feel like shit cuz i actually envy people who believe in god. i feel like it #8217;s easier to have faith in the world when you believe that some higher power put you on this planet for a reason.</TEXT>

    <TITLE> #8220;Feeling #8221; Abandoned</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-28 18:43:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I (23f) currently live with my parents, older sister (27f) and grandma and my older sister can not wait to get out of this house. She absolutely hates it here but she can #8217;t afford to move out quite yet. The reason why I get these feelings of being abandonment is cuz she #8217;s been a source of comfort for me, like my only friend in this house. We #8217;ve had a lot of good times together and i like to think we are friends but sometimes i don #8217;t get the same feeling back. I know it #8217;s really selfish of me to feel this way because she is her own person who has her own goals and needs and wants but every time we talk about her moving out, she gives all these reasons why. Like how no one in this house is good for her, people in this house brings her down and i #8217;m like,  #8220;am i included in that? #8221; I know i #8217;m a mess (emotionally and physically - my room is always a disaster) and i can tell that my sister doesn #8217;t like to be around me when i go through a spell. recently university had pulled me into a deep deep depression and i could tell she wanted nothing to do with me until i started to feel a little better. idk, maybe i see her as a friend and a sister while she only sees me as a sister. i guess i #8217;m just afraid to be alone. i #8217;ll feel alone without her here.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Apparently Procreating is the Only Reason to Get Married</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-06 18:21:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I should know better than to get upset over idiots like this but I was on one today. Saw a very cute lesbian wedding photo that went viral on twitter and of course here comes the christians, mainly africians (the couple was black btw, istg africian twitter is the most homophobic space on twitter) all up in the comments going  #8220;how will they have kids?!?! #8221; and  #8220;dicks are for pussys, it #8217;s not pussy for pussy #8221; (....are you kidding me) oh and my personal favorite  #8220;congrats! if you need a dick in your lives call me  #128521; #8221; *vomits* This made me think of how marriage, even to homophobes, isn #8217;t about love, it #8217;s about procreating and it kinda goes to show their ignorant ideas about gay couples. Like wow the only reason you should be married is to have kids and of course only a man and woman can have kids so fuck gay people and btw you #8217;re going to HELL. It #8217;s ludicrous! And what gets to me especially is that they apparently have no awareness that artificial insemination and adoption exists??? Adopting would be a much better alternative to insemination anyway because you would be giving a home to an existing kid who need one, not contributing to an already bloated world population. It #8217;s kinda upsetting to me especially because as a queer woman myself I can only see myself marrying another woman and living an amazing child free life with them, and I just know that there are people in my family (we #8217;re haitian) that act and behave like these losers. Makes me feel like I can never come out to my family and that this life I #8217;ve always imagined myself living will not include them. oh well.</TEXT>
