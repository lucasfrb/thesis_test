    <TEXT>I #8217;m totally in the same boat! I moved here in December following graduation and thankfully I #8217;m still working, though not as much. My weekends and evenings are mainly consumed by just walking around and learning everything I can about the city (history, how to get around without a phone). I #8217;ve also been reading and trying to learn the piano but I #8217;m still bad at it. Every time I think about how much feeling stuck sucks, I remember we live in an astoundingly beautiful place and just try to make the most of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure this was an 80s/90s thing. This collab has actually come to be pretty appreciated within the community (especially the  #8220;old heads #8221;, I #8217;ve found) because they created a quality garment. Hoodies and sweatshirts seem to hold the most value because they are the fan favorite of all the garments produced between the brands, but t shirts are just as good in my eyes... Long story short you found a good piece built to last.</TEXT>
