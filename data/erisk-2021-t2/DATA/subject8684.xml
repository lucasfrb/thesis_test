The more details the better.** Gaming (CSGO, FIFA and some good game at medium quality im fine with). And video analysis from my soccer games (coaching U17 team). **If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)** I already bought monitor (Viewsonic XG2402 144hz). I want a build which suits this monitor. Also I would like to have my future GPU a HDMI to connect my tv. **What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?** 1500 euros for everything. I already have mouse (FK2), keyboard (maybe i will update with separate budget) and like i told before monitor. I also have speakers and nice headphones for online gaming. **In what country are you purchasing your parts?** Belgium, but I can buy from amazon germany of france. **Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). I would love to have ryzen cpu, a good mobo, 16 or 32 gb ram and gpu for 300 - 500 euro's. Sry for not specifying.. **Provide any additional details you wish below.** /.</TEXT>

Lost 4:3. Broken game, dont play this again. Its not about skill or understanding the game of football (im uefa b coach) but who pays, he wins. Im not paying anything.</TEXT>
