    <TEXT>Howdy! I #8217;ve been playing around with the generator for a while, and I absolutely love it. However, I #8217;m still not sure I totally understand how burg/rural populations are calculated. I know they can be customised, and -sort of- understand the slider values (and, obviously, directly inputting values via the burg editor for very fine-tuning); but I #8217;m curious if there #8217;s a more comprehensive explainer/blog post available. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello hello. :) I was editing my cultures, and ended up determining that I had one too many. I tried deleting it from the culture editor, but nothing happened. Thinking that it was maybe just an issue with refreshing, I closed out the culture editor and tried opening it up again, but nothing happened. Then I checked the culture map, and **all** the cultures were gone; and I still can't open the culture editor to try and remake them from scratch. :( However, when I mouse over cells, I still get culture data. Is this a known issue, or am I uniquely breaking things?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Strictly speaking, we weren #8217;t supposed to make First Contact with the Burral; however, we felt obliged. When our fleet entered the Burral #8217;s system, we were supremely confident that we wouldn #8217;t be detected. Their technology was about on-par with ours in the early-Twentieth century. Even Nineteenth in some fields and places. They were easily six or seven generations away from being able to even get hints of our ships. They were, however, beginning to experiment with manned space flight, and that #8217;s where things went wrong. One of their ships messed up a thrusting manoeuvre around one their moons. It wouldn #8217;t have been catastrophic on its own, but it resulted in a collision with one of our probes, killing all hands. As commander of the expedition, I had an obligation to take responsibility for any loss of life - be it my crew or another #8217;s. So, I opened up a channel to express our regrets and to try to make amends. It was a little unnerving how readily they accepted my overtures for negotiations, but I was happy that we could resolve this peacefully. Their welcome reception when we landed was a true spectacle. They paraded soldiers from all of their nations, proudly flew their latest jet aircraft, and held galas in all their major capitals. I, of course, insisted on visiting the memorial they had constructed to their fallen astronauts, and was saddened to see that it was just one part of a greater memorial to dozens of their astronauts who had died. They were struggling with some fundamentals of rocketry in a way we never quite suffered. I felt bad about how one-sided our negotiations were. We had always envisioned our First Contact to be with either a peer or more advanced race. But they had exactly nothing to offer us that we didn #8217;t have in abundance across our worlds, and some of the things they wanted would have put me far outside of established protocol to offer. We settled on advances in medicine and agriculture, rocketry, computing, materials sciences, and general physics that, all together, would put them somewhat closer to humanity #8217;s Twenty-First Century. But then, with some sadness, I had to inform them that we could not establish permanent contact until they achieved certain milestones - ones that would be very far away for them. They were hurt (who wants to be told, basically, that they #8217;re an inferior species?), but I assured them that we would be waiting in good faith and with open arms. With that, we departed; and I filed my First Contact report. Of course, I fully expected it when I was ordered home and subsequently rebuked for having violated protocols; however, humanity was just so happy to find out that it wasn #8217;t alone in the galaxy that, under enormous public pressure, I was promoted with commendations. Officially, we keep clear of the Burral #8217;s space. Unofficially, I still check in with the probe I discreetly left behind for them to find one day to check on their progress. They #8217;re doing better than expected as they eagerly strive to re-establish contact. I won #8217;t live to see it happen, but I hope my successor lives up to my side of the bargain: to greet them with open arms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Dragonsbane #8221; comes in two forms. The first form is what most are familiar with: destruction. The dragon annihilating a village that was built just that little bit too near or within its territory. The second is, in my view, the worst: exhaustion. I know, because I #8217;ve experienced both. When I was a child, my family narrowly escaped the firestorm of a dragon incensed to find our settlement on  #8220;its #8221; side of the river, encroaching on its solitude. Of course, it had been in solitude for so long that nobody remembered it existed; so, we were just as shocked as it was - but far less prepared. After a period of wandering, we settled in a new town, and lived peacefully for years. My father was a successful craftsman, my mother a respected midwife. My sister married into the local nobility. We had almost forgotten about the horror of the years before. The town was holding a celebration for the birth of my nephew, the lord #8217;s heir, when the dragon descended. Understandably, people fled in terror; and, seeing this, the dragon roared,  #8220;Wait! Come back! I didn #8217;t mean to scare you. #8221; That got everyone #8217;s attention, and seemed to please the dragon.  #8220;I am so sorry, #8221; it said, doing its best to navigate our narrow streets into the town square.  #8220;But I was flying nearby and heard your party, and I just had to come by. I didn #8217;t know there was a town here! I haven #8217;t been by this way in so long. #8221; Our lord, my brother-in-law, mustered up his courage and approached the dragon.  #8220;Well, uh, it #8217;s a great honour to have you join us, uh...? #8221; The dragon #8217;s laugh could have ruptured eardrums if it hadn #8217;t been aimed skyward.  #8220;Oh! Oh, my name is much too hard to pronounce for human tongues, and I can #8217;t remember what the humans last called me. Now, what are we celebrating? #8221;  #8220;The arrival of my firstborn. #8221;  #8220;Oh, how glorious! #8221; the dragon exclaimed, beating its wings, sending a burst of wind through the streets and knocking over a number of people. It didn #8217;t seem to notice.  #8220;Well, please, don #8217;t stop on my account. Continue! I heard music...? #8221; And that was the beginning of the hardship. The party continued for days and nights on end. Nobody wanted to be the one to tell the dragon to leave; and the dragon, for whom months are days, seemed to be utterly clueless when it had long outstayed its welcome. Musicians had to be hauled away as they passed out from exhaustion. Our food stocks were emptied. Traders, seeing the dragon from a distance, refused to come anywhere near the town. Our livestock fled. All the while, the dragon #8217;s appetite for conversation was bottomless. It wanted to know everything about everyone, and constantly regaled us with tales of events from ages long beyond memory. People quietly evacuated as they could, taking their chances by possibly offending the dragon by their absence rather than spend hours recalling the details of distant relations and the banality of their daily lives. Facing ruin, the town #8217;s merchants and lower nobles cornered the lord with a very plain demand: make the dragon leave, or they would send word to the king to call the militia and take their chances in combat. So it was that the lord emptied the town #8217;s coffers and, shambling from exhaustion at the endless days of entertaining, presented it to the dragon.  #8220;My great and honoured friend, #8221; he managed,  #8220;We present you with this gift for gracing us with your presence, and blessing the birth of my son. #8221; The dragon took in a deep breath in what appeared to be genuine surprise.  #8220;A gift? For me? No. #8221;  #8220;Yes, friend, #8221; our lord very plainly insisted.  #8220;A gift for you. #8221;  #8220;Oh, you #8217;ve all been so kind, #8221; the dragon said.  #8220;I haven #8217;t had his much fun since the time... #8221;  #8220;...The time that the Knights of Velkimar came to your home, yes, you told us already. It was a wonderful tale. #8221; Mustering up his courage again, he said,  #8220;But, friend, the harvest is at hand, and we must... #8221;  #8220;Of course, #8221; the dragon said with a chuckle.  #8220;Yes, yes, I know how important all of that is to you humans. It #8217;s all very exciting, isn #8217;t it? Well... #8221; the dragon took the cart of our treasury  #8220;...this was absolutely fantastic. Congratulations, again... #8221;  #8220;Thank you. #8221;  #8220;...and I look forward to seeing you all very soon! #8221; With that, it flew off. When a lookout judged that the dragon was sufficiently far away, those of us who remained all cheered. That is, until someone asked,  #8220;How long is  #8216;very soon #8217; in dragontime? #8221; I bid my family farewell the next morning, and set out in search of a distant home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loved the sound of birds from as far back as I can remember. It was one of the reasons I moved out into the country. Now, however, I would die happy if I never heard another bird in my life. When I heard voices as I stumbled back to my car after climbing out of the gorge, I thought it was just a temporary side-effect of a concussion. I was mostly right, in that it was a side-effect. Two weeks later, and it #8217;s feeling very permanent. I didn #8217;t really notice that the voices were persisting until I got home from the hospital. But I #8217;ll never forget how I was woken up the next morning.  #8220;Hey! #8221; I heard from outside as the first rays of sun crept over the horizon.  #8220;Hey, yo! Where all y #8217;all ladies at?! Hey! #8221;  #8220;I #8217;m over here! #8221;  #8220;You wanna come over here? #8221;  #8220;No, not really. #8221;  #8220;Oh, c #8217;mon! Come over here! #8221;  #8220;No, thank you. #8221;  #8220;How  #8216;bout I come over there, show you my tail feathers? #8221;  #8220;Boy, it #8217;s too early for that. I ain #8217;t even eaten yet. You keep those feathers to yourself! #8221;  #8220;C #8217;mon, girl! #8221; In a mixture of confusion and anger, I opened my window and shouted,  #8220;Whoever that is, get the fuck off my property! #8221; And then I was hit with a cacophony from all directions.  #8220;Human! Human! It #8217;s angry! Get the kids! Angry human! Fly away! Tell the others! I #8217;ll save you, ladies! Human! #8221; And when the birds took flight, the insects started up.  #8220;They are awoken! Death! Death! All is lost! We are forsaken! #8221; Terrified, I shut the window. It only got worse from there. The spider in my bathroom - who I didn #8217;t know was even there - cursed me for chasing away a fly. (Those were her last words). I overheard ants in my kitchen commiserating with roaches about the cleanliness of my pantry. A mouse under my floorboards complained about all the noise I was making. In a panic, I fled the house. I didn #8217;t really know where I was going, just away. I drove up an old fire trail until I felt sufficiently alone. Taking deep breaths, I stepped out of the car. Did you know trees sing love songs to each other when a strong enough wind blows? On the one hand, it #8217;s very sweet. On the other, imagine being surrounded by a choir of thousands, all singing separate songs. It #8217;s disorienting, to say the least; and on top of the other events, I cracked. I covered my head with my arms and fell to the ground, closed my eyes and took a fetal position. I started begging for the noise to stop. After a while, I heard a woman #8217;s sympathetic voice.  #8220;Are you okay? #8221;  #8220;No, #8221; I said through tears.  #8220;No, I #8217;m not. #8221;  #8220;Let me help you. #8221; Expecting to see a ranger, I opened my eyes and lowered my arms. Nope, it was a mountain lion. I shrieked. She leapt back.  #8220;Calm down! #8221; she said.  #8220;Just, calm down. #8221;  #8220;You #8217;re talking! #8221;  #8220;Um, yes? We all talk. Everything talks. Welcome to nature. #8221; A cub appeared from the other side of the car.  #8220;Mommy, what #8217;s wrong with the human? #8221;  #8220;Nothing, my little hunter. It #8217;s just hearing for the first time. #8221;  #8220;This cannot be real. #8221;  #8220;Oh, it is. #8221; She stepped closer.  #8220;We #8217;ve always been able to talk, but you humans have spent generations shutting the rest of us out. We #8217;ve all given up trying to get your attention. #8221;  #8220;It #8217;s all so much... #8221;  #8220;Yeah, #8221; she said with a smirk.  #8220;If you don #8217;t know how to filter some of it out, it can get to you. #8221;  #8220;How do I filter it? #8221;  #8220;You just do. Have to. Birds in particular, #8221; she said with a growl.  #8220;If they #8217;re not trying to get laid, they #8217;re picking fights over food and territory. Annoying bastards. #8221;  #8220;What... What do I have to do to make it all quiet again? #8221;  #8220;Mom, #8221; the impatient cub whined,  #8220;I #8217;m hungry. You promised we were going to go hunting. #8221; The lioness turned back.  #8220;Yes, we #8217;re going in a moment. Let me finish my conversation. #8221; She returned to me.  #8220;I don #8217;t know, human. I don #8217;t even know how you regained your hearing. My advice is to start training it, make it a gift instead of a burden. #8221; I wasn #8217;t sure what to say, having never had a conversation with a cat before. So I just nodded.  #8220;Okay. #8221;  #8220;Excellent, #8221; she said.  #8220;Now, have you seen any deer come through here? #8221; I shook my head.  #8220;Darn. Well, take care. #8221; She disappeared into the bushes along the side of the road and called out to her cub.  #8220;Come on! We #8217;ll pick up a scent soon. #8221; Before returning to his mother, the cub gave me a long stare. Then he said,  #8220;I think you #8217;re going to go crazy, #8221; before he scampered off. Sitting here now, I think he #8217;s right. I #8217;ve spent most of the last two weeks with earbuds in, but I can still hear... Everything. There is no such thing as quiet - day or night. Nothing is getting filtered out. I #8217;ve been desperately searching for properties in the city, but haven #8217;t found anything yet. I #8217;d take a loft situated over a nightclub, to be perfectly honest. I have zero intentions of finding out what Nature sounds like once Spring gets underway in earnest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The silence was very long and very uncomfortable as the Overseer meticulously flipped through my report. The Managers looked on intently. On finishing the last page, it took a breath and looked down the table at me.  #8220;So, if I understand your report correctly, we now have a simulation full of  #8216;gods. #8217; Am I correct? #8221; The Managers turned to me in silent unison. I nodded.  #8220;Yes, Overseer. #8221;  #8220;Your report speaks of a code they unlocked. #8221;  #8220;Yes, Overseer. It #8217;s standard protocol to keep in a backdoor in all of our simulations for maintenance or emergencies. #8221;  #8220;Mmhmm, I am aware. But your report lacks detail of just how they discovered it. Seems like a very convenient  #8216;accident. #8217; #8221;  #8220;It is! #8221; I insisted.  #8220;The code was designed with complexity and to require such precision that it ought to have been impossible to crack - even with the right knowledge! #8221;  #8220;And yet... #8221; I sighed.  #8220;The odds of anyone, much less Chad, #8221; I spat his name,  #8220;perfectly combining the auditory and physical stimuli needed to open the command module were... #8221;  #8220;Impossible, #8221; the Overseer said wryly. I just lowered my head. From the very first days of the simulation, humans had tried to mimic our engineers dances to unlock rain events or improve various skill sets. In time, though, they relegated the link between dancing and affecting the simulation to legends and superstitions. But then Chad... Fucking Chad. Chad took three shots of tequila at a New York City nightclub, declared himself  #8220;God of the dance floor, #8221; and, somehow, executed an absolutely perfect Override Routine at the same time that DJ Tromboner #8217;s new, chart-topping single,  #8220;Drop UR Booty (Like This Beat) #8221; hit perfect resonance with the audio input. Making matters worse, Chad #8217;s bros were recording the whole thing, expecting him to make a fool out of himself. Instead, within hours, millions of people figured out how to unlock the command module for themselves. On top of all that, three-thousand years earlier, we upgraded the module to support native languages at the request of some of our embedded engineers who had forgotten the mother tongue. So every time someone new acquired access, they saw all the prompts in their own language. I won #8217;t even bother going into how easy the WYSIWYG interface made it for people to figure out how to get what they wanted (although I guess that #8217;s a credit to our UI/UX team). It was absolute chaos before we were able to pause the simulation. The number of people with infinite money, infinite health, maximum libidos (guess which Chad gave himself) was causing the whole thing to crash.  #8220;So, #8221; the Overseer said.  #8220;What do you recommend? #8221;  #8220;Well, #8221; I said nervously,  #8220;we could just go back to the last backup and let it run again from there. #8221;  #8220;Your report says that would be in their equivalent year of 1947. #8221;  #8220;Correct. #8221; The Managers harmonised a minor chord in unison to express their disapproval. The Overseer tapped on the table, silencing them.  #8220;We #8217;ve just been running the simulation for the last two hundred years just because of its own inertia, yes? Other simulations have achieved our research goals. #8221;  #8220;Yes, that #8217;s correct. 3AR-TH has some benefactors who like to visit occasionally, so... #8221;  #8220;So we can entice them to support some of our other projects. Shut it down. #8221;  #8220;Pardon? #8221; I sucked in a breath as the Managers shouted at me for my insubordination. The Overseer glared.  #8220;You heard me, shut it down. Wipe 3AR-TH so we can make room for a new project. #8221;  #8220;Yes, Overseer. My apologies. #8221; The Overseer flipped through my report again.  #8220;Before you do, isolate Chad. Make him watch his universe get erased. And make his termination painful. #8221; I swallowed hard.  #8220;Yes, Overseer. #8221;  #8220;Thank you. #8221; The report deatomized.  #8220;That #8217;s all. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you ever had that nightmare about showing up to school naked? Pretty unsettling, right? Okay, now imagine that the class was excited to see you in the buff. Yeah. I was literal moments from reaching the ultimate moment with my latest Tinder date when, in the blink of an eye, I found myself atop an altar in a place I did not recognise.  #8220;It worked! #8221; a man excitedly shouted.  #8220;The demon is summoned! #8221; I looked around as cries of joy filled the room and saw about a dozen people in dark robes all very joyously cheering my name.  #8220;Hail, Jeremy, the Angel Slayer! Glory to his power! #8221; The immediate weirdness made me temporarily forget my nakedness; but when I stood up, I became keenly aware of it. But in trying to afford myself some modesty, I noticed that my skin had become blood red, my hands replaced with talons, and my legs were goat-like right down to the hooves in place of my feet. I was generously enhanced in other ways, too, but we don #8217;t need to talk about that. I screamed, but it came out as a roar; and rather than scaring the apparent cult, they cheered my name louder.  #8220;Stop! #8221; I begged.  #8220;Stop! Why am I here?! #8221; A man in a particularly ornate robe stepped forward into the circle on the floor around the altar.  #8220;We have summoned you, Lord Jeremy, to bring judgment to this world! To reshape it according to prophesy! #8221;  #8220;Behold! Behold! #8221; the others chanted. His obvious seriousness took me aback.  #8220;I... Wow. What? #8221; The chief priest continued.  #8220;It has been written that you, Mighty Jeremy, Angelsbane, will purge humanity of weakness and help us usher in the eternal... #8221;  #8220;Okay, stop, #8221; I insisted.  #8220;Just, stop right there. I don #8217;t know who #8217;s been writing what, but I #8217;m not any  #8216;Angelsbane, #8217; okay? I #8217;m an independent realtor. I sell houses in upscale markets. #8221; The priest looked confused.  #8220;But, you are Jeremy, yes? Son of U #8217;uthra, Commander of the Fallen Legions? #8221; That weirded me out.  #8220;Uh, my last name is Luther, and my dad was a general in the Marine Corps, sure? #8221;  #8220;The insatiable defiler of immoral women? #8221; another said.  #8220;Okay, that #8217;s out of line, #8221; I snapped.  #8220;I mean, yeah, I like sex. Who doesn #8217;t? #8221;  #8220;He demands his sacrifice! #8221; the chief priest shouted.  #8220;Bring her to the altar! #8221; I felt a massive wave of anxiety, affirmed moments later when two cultists dragged a bound woman out of a side room and tossed her at the base of the altar. She looked up at me and screamed as loud as I #8217;ve ever heard from someone.  #8220;Okay, guys, this isn #8217;t cool. No. I #8217;m not into... This, whatever this is. No. #8221;  #8220;But she is a whore, #8221; the chief priest implored.  #8220;Not cool! #8221; I barked, thrusting a talon towards him. As I did, it burst into flames, causing him to step out of the circle. The cultists started chanting. The  #8216;sacrifice #8217; screamed again.  #8220;Shut up! #8221; I shouted.  #8220;Everybody just shut the fuck up! #8221; I felt my body burst into flames; and, obediently, the room fell silent. I took a few deep breaths, which caused the flames to subside, and then stepped down from the altar. I approached the bound woman and helped her to her feet before snapping her bonds.  #8220;Go on, #8221; I said.  #8220;Get out of here. #8221; She didn #8217;t need to be told twice. She bolted for a door as the disappointed cultists looked on.  #8220;You are... Displeased? #8221; the chief priest asked.  #8220;Yeah, I #8217;m pretty fucking displeased right now, #8221; I growled. The cultists dropped to the floor in supplication.  #8220;We are your servants, Jeremy! #8221; they chanted.  #8220;Let us please you! #8221; Before I could say anything else, the ground began to shake. By the cultists #8217; reactions, I could that wasn #8217;t their doing. Then the roof caved in, letting in a bright beam of light, down from which an armoured, sword-bearing angel descended. It approached me, fury on its face.  #8220;Jeremy! Wretched demon! You are forbidden from this world! Go back. #8221; I put my hands up.  #8220;Hey, man, I would love to go back. Just show me the way, and I #8217;m gone. #8221;  #8220;Fight him, Angelsbane! #8221; the chief priest implored.  #8220;Fight him, and realise your dest... #8221; The angel sliced him in half and spat,  #8220;Sinner. #8221; I just about threw up.  #8220;What the fuck, man?! What the fucking fuck?! #8221; While gesticulating my horror, fireballs shot from my hands and struck the angel, sending him flying across the room. I felt my stomach drop.  #8220;Oh, man. My bad. #8221; The angel recovered, raised his sword and charged at me. I tried to send another fireball his way, but couldn #8217;t figure it out. I screamed before he landed a blow - a blow which never came. A trumpet sounded, and an impossibly bright light filled my vision. When it cleared, I was back in my house, in my bedroom ensuite, staring into the mirror. Same as when I was summoned.  #8220;C #8217;mon, stud, #8221; my date coyly called from the bedroom.  #8220;What #8217;s taking so long. #8221; I sighed in relief and replied,  #8220;I #8217;m here, babe. Just gettin #8217; ready for ya. #8221; But when I stepped into the bedroom, in place of my had-been human date, was what I would best describe as a humanoid she-wolf with bright red eyes. I looked down at myself, and saw my human body once again replaced by demonic form.  #8220;Well, c #8217;mon, Angelsbane, #8221; she growled.  #8220;Give this bad girl her punishment. #8221; I wanted to scream. I laughed instead, and heard the pleasant wailing of eternally damned souls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mark #8217;s phone vibrated while we were having breakfast. We weren #8217;t supposed to have our phones at the table, but Mom and Dad gave him an exception because of  #8220;how available #8221; he needed to be. He grinned at me and said,  #8220;Sorry, it #8217;s Dan. #8221; Dan. His agent. His. Agent. I looked up at him as he checked his notification with all the rage I could muster, praying that lasers would shoot out of my eyes and roast that stupid smirk off of his stupid face. He read the message aloud.  #8220;Hey, Mark, I know your upcoming book tour is already packed, but apparently the governor of California #8217;s wife runs a book club, and they were hoping you could make time to come by. What should I tell them? #8221; I felt another piece of my soul die. Five months ago, my twin brother was barely passing AP English Lit, a class that he barely got into in the first place, and only because Mom told him to. He openly shat on every book assigned after reading past the first two chapters, and then just looked up the highlights on the Internet. That #8217;s when I told him to  #8220;shit or get off the pot! #8221; and write his own book. And now he #8217;s being hailed as a prodigy over what is, by any objective standard, the most mediocre novel of the last two-hundred years. It #8217;s not bad, sure. Okay. I #8217;ll admit that. But it #8217;s not good, either, much less some  #8220;masterpiece for the ages, a work of art on every page, #8221; as the New Yorker fawned. It #8217;s a pile of tropes wrapped around a wholly predictable love story. There was no reason his Reddit AMA should have crashed the site. The worst part? He dedicated it to Mom and Dad, but not me. I #8217;m not even named on his Wikipedia page.  #8220;You should absolutely go, #8221; Dad said with a mouthful of bacon, like this was completely normal.  #8220;It #8217;s the governor. #8221;  #8220;His wife, #8221; Mom said.  #8220;And we didn #8217;t vote for him anyway. #8221; She turned and put a hand on Mark #8217;s knee.  #8220;Honey, you #8217;re going to be so busy... #8221;  #8220;I know, Mom, #8221; he said, his grin widening,  #8220;but people just can #8217;t get enough of me, and who am I to... #8221; I couldn #8217;t take it anymore.  #8220;ARRRGH!!! This is such fucking bullshit! #8221;  #8220;Jayson! #8221; Dad snapped.  #8220;No! This is crap, okay? It #8217;s crap. I #8217;ve been reading and writing since I was three years old - three years old! I love storytelling. I love literature. But everything I put out there just dies. Then all of a sudden he... #8221; I thrust my knife towards Mark  #8220;...he shat out some banal turd in one sitting, and the world lost its mind! #8221; There was fire in Mom #8217;s eyes,  #8220;Jayson, that is no way to talk about your brother #8217;s accomplishment! #8221; Dad was about to have his turn, when Mark said,  #8220;Guys, guys, it #8217;s okay. It #8217;s just like what Prince Eldomir said when he was vanquished to the realm of the lost Elves... #8221; I closed my eyes and braced myself for his stupid quote from his stupid half-blood prince to his stupid future elvish bride in that stupid, stupid, stupid goddamned book.  #8220;...Though alas my heart is heavy, I journey forward, in the hopes of finding acceptance and love in those who may want me. #8221; I heard my Mom sigh and my dad sniffle.  #8220;I hate you, #8221; I muttered.  #8220;Well, maybe one day you can write your own book, #8221; he replied.  #8220;I #8217;ve got contacts, you know? #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Are you sure you don #8217;t just want a window? #8221; I asked.  #8220;Because I know a guy, very good... #8221;  #8220;No, #8221; she repeated.  #8220;It has to be a door. I want to be able to go inside. To fix things, if possible. #8221; I sighed, leaned back in my chair, and stared up at the ceiling.  #8220;Give me a second to think. #8221;  #8220;Of course. #8221; The impulse was to reject her request out of hand as impossible. What she wanted invited all manner of paradoxes that, as far as I knew, doomed the project before it started. Even my time travel doors had to follow very strict rules, often disappointing my clients. But then, I #8217;d never actually *tried* before. I rocked my chair back-and-forth while I thought through the myriad of tricks I #8217;d acquired over the decades. A temporal delay mechanism might work, or a buffer for the intradimensional overlap. Continuum defragmenting was definitely out of the question. Parallel reality lacing was another option; but, the more I thought about it, the more certain I was that it would be more complicated than the output was worth. After going down a few rabbit holes, I summarised my problem.  #8220;See, what you #8217;re trying to do something literal to something that #8217;s figurative.  #8220;I can make a portal to another dimension or universe, because those exist. I can make a portal to a heaven or a hell because they exist. I can make someone travel through time, because that continuum exists. #8221; I sat up.  #8220;But you want to go into your mind. #8221; She looked puzzled.  #8220;My mind exists. #8221;  #8220;Your *brain* exists, #8221; I said.  #8220;But your *mind*, or your *consciousness*, is a construct to describe the collective nature of thought. #8221; I chuckled,  #8220;I mean, I think I could make you go into your brain, but unless you #8217;re a neurologist, I don #8217;t think that #8217;d end well. #8221;  #8220;But a moment ago you suggested a window...? #8221; she asked with raised eyebrow.  #8220;Oh, yeah! Windows and mirrors are great for showing constructs, perceived and distorted realities. My guy could easily make you a *window* into your mind or your soul so you could see their  #8216;truth, #8217; but you wanna go in. #8221;  #8220;Is there something wrong with that? #8221; I shrugged.  #8220;Not my place to say. #8221; I leaned forward on the desk.  #8220;Is there something in there that #8217;s bothering you? #8221;  #8220;Not your place to know, #8221; she snapped. Making the logical deduction, I followed up.  #8220;Have you tried a potion? #8221;  #8220;Potions are what *other* people say I need, #8221; she replied.  #8220;I want to see for myself. Make my own adjustments and corrections, as needed. #8221; I leaned back in my chair again and stared past her while I crunched some numbers. Then I looked at her.  #8220;Okay. #8221; She beamed.  #8220;Really? #8221;  #8220;Yeah, why not? I haven #8217;t had a challenge in a while. #8221; I paused.  #8220;Gonna be expensive, though. I #8217;m going to need some specialised materials. #8221;  #8220;Of course, #8221; she replied.  #8220;I understand. #8221;  #8220;And, hey, #8221; I said sharply with pointed finger,  #8220;*if* it works, and *if* you do something that screws yourself up, don #8217;t come knocking on my door asking for a refund. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Good morning, Missus Abagnale, #8221; I said cheerfully.  #8220;How are you feeling today? #8221; The old woman, who looked to have been hooked up to one machine for every vital organ, struggled to take in a deep breath as she turned her head towards me. She took another labored breath and said,  #8220;I #8217;m feel like I #8217;m fucking dying. #8221;  #8220;That #8217;s great, #8221; I said, noting her response on her chart.  #8220;Who are you? #8221;  #8220;My name is Cindy, and I will be your Reanimation Care Provider going forward. #8221; The industry was slowly phasing out the use of the word,  #8220;Necromancer, #8221; due to too many connotations with evil spirits and abuse of patients #8217; bodies. The sighed, which triggered a coughing fit. I noted the flecks of blood she coughed up.  #8220;You #8217;re my third necromancer since I got in here. What happened to the other guy? #8221;  #8220;Cleric Gupta is on vacation; but, don #8217;t worry, he gave me a full handover before he left. #8221; That was bullshit. Jay dumped his files on me and couldn #8217;t get out the door fast enough for two months in Hawaii. I spent all last night reading my new patients #8217; histories. For most people in Victoria Abagnale #8217;s condition, they would have been transferred to palliative care and died weeks ago. She, however, wanted a literal life after death, which is how she came to our ward. It #8217;s true that necromancy #8217;s history is full of sordid chapters containing armies of the dead, sadistic tormenting of souls, and bargains with demons. For those reasons, most nations banned necromancy well into the Twentieth Century. Even the Eighth Amendment has a waiver for punishments,  #8220;in cases of those found guilty by their peers of unnatural interference of Death. #8221; Some incredibly creative punishments for necromancy technically remain on the books and enforceable, although that hasn #8217;t happened in my lifetime. As our understanding of the biological processes behind death improved, so did our understanding of what was necessary to safely reanimate a person. In time, we were able to figure out how to give people a reasonably good standard of life in reanimation and not be a subservient, shambling, soulless corpse. However, this depended entirely on the way a person died. Our main job as necromancers is to ensure people die as humanely as possible so that their reanimation can take place with the fewest complications. I'm sure more people would take the option of reanimation if it weren't so expensive. No insurance company covers it; and, because we are a highly specialised field, our services are not cheap. Of course, traditional hospitals, its staff oath-bound to do everything in their power to *prevent* their patients #8217; deaths, want the absolute minimal engagement with us (other than the money we bring in). That #8217;s why we are relegated to a back ward and even prohibited from wearing our black scrubs in primary and intensive care areas. That is, if I had black scrubs.  #8220;Wait, #8221; Missus Abagnale said.  #8220;You #8217;re not a cleric. You #8217;re just an acolyte! #8221; My scrubs, as a resident, were technically tombstone grey. Clerics wore black, elder clerics black with red fringe. Whereas other medical professions and institutions were generally abandoning color-coded scrubs, ours was stubbornly holding on to tradition. Downside of being part of an ancient order. I sighed.  #8220;Yes, I am an acolyte; but I was top of my class at Johns Hopkins, did my rituals at Oxford, and have been formally excommunicated. I promise that your death is in good hands. #8221;  #8220;You #8217;re not going to revive me though, right? #8221;  #8220;I #8217;ll be assisting, #8221; I flipped through her file,  #8220;Elder Metzger for your reanimation. You #8217;re lucky. He #8217;s going to Hyderabad soon to take his Master examination. #8221;  #8220;When? #8221; she impatiently barked.  #8220;Oh, you should be dead well before... #8221;  #8220;No! #8221; she coughed.  #8220;When am I going to die? I #8217;ve been dying for weeks. Just kill me already. #8221;  #8220;We have to make sure that your death is orderly, #8221; I patiently replied.  #8220;Now, I can see about doing more for pain relief; but, if we give you anything stronger, that would put an orderly death in jeopardy. #8221; Victoria coughed again and turned away.  #8220;Fine, fine, whatever, #8221; she said.  #8220;Do what you #8217;ve gotta do, and then go. #8221; I frowned. This was just the start of my rounds. It #8217;s reasonable to expect people to get temperamental as they approach death, but I hated rudeness. I took her vitals, made some other notes about her general appearance, and then left her room. I checked my schedule again. Eleven patients. Hopefully most of them would be in better moods; but, regardless, my job was to make sure that their death was the best experience it could be. I took a deep breath, got my smile back, and headed into the next room.  #8220;Good morning, Senator. How are you today? #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imputing possible numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States using variable [case fatality ratios](https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate) (CFR) estimating a 14-day lag ([per WHO estimations](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)) from newly reported deaths each day. CFRs are derived from CDC reports ([Source](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0233_article), [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm)). The 4.5% CFR is the upper-bound from observations in Wuhan; 3.4% the upper-bound from CDC estimations in the U.S.; 1.8% is the current reported deaths-to-cases ratio in the U.S., the average CFR in Hubei (excl. Wuhan), and the lower-bound CDC estimate; and 1.6% the lower-bound for Hubei (excl. Wuhan). eg, if 10 new deaths were reported in a day, the estimation assumes that they were part of a cohort which acquired COVID-19 14 days prior; and, depending on the CFR, the total new cases from that day would have been somewhere between 222 (CFR=4.5) and 625 (CFR=1.6). Because the imputations are on a 14-day lag, bringing the estimations to the current date required forecasting forward in the absence of reported deaths. Therefore, they were brought forward using the 14-day average rate of increased deaths (+30.5% daily). The estimated numbers of cases requiring hospital and/or ICU admissions are also derived from the CDC estimates and based on the 4.5% CFR imputed case numbers. **Update:** Also, just as I finished writing this, I realized that I'm an idiot and should have brought forward the imputed admissions by five days to reflect the median incubation period ([Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported)). *When you do that* ([as I've done here](https://imgur.com/CFiuQ8M)) the number of reported cases falls almost bang-on the anticipated number of hospital admissions rather than falling between the ICU rates. So, I'm an idiot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Inspired by [this (removed) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/frywwg/the_number_of_posts_here_have_probably_increased/), I was curious to see if there was, in fact, an inverse correlation between global interest in showering (and bathing, as a control) versus activity on r/Showerthoughts. While the post is correct insofar as there being a general, apparent decline in interest in showering (and bathing, gross), activity on the subreddit has also fallen after a brief spike in early March. Search interest peaks correspond with weekends. Made with Excel, data from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/) and [Subreddit Stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/showerthoughts).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unemployment [data from the Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE), official periods of recession [determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/cycles.html). "Coronavirus" recession assumed. These charts follow the change in unemployment rates from the start of a recession until the rate either recovered to pre-recession levels or a new recession commenced. So while, for example, the unemployment rate in the U.S. hit 10%, it was just five points higher than pre-recession. Likewise, while the unemployment rate hit 10.8% in 1982, that was also about five points higher than pre-recession levels. The 1980 and 1981 recessions were combined because of their proximity. Only reason for not including the Great Depression is because it utterly blows out the scales on both axes and makes it almost impossible to discern other periods of recession beyond the GFC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An update to [my chart from a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fnca21/oc_comparing_countries_confirmed_coronavirus/). The point of the chart is to measure [**prevalence**](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/what-is-prevalence.shtml) (ie, the share of the population which has confirmed cases) rather than incidence (ie, the raw number of cases). Using prevalence allows us to make better national comparisons about the impact of coronavirus at population levels. It has nothing to do with challenging whether the number of cases is growing exponentially within a population (the fact that the prevalence rate is plotted on a logarithmic scale makes that point) or whether a nation's population density impacts the rate of spread. It's simply about comparing the proportions of nations who've been confirmed to have the virus; and, as this chart shows, many of the most highly impacted nations are at very similar levels of prevalence - even though they have wildly different numbers of incidences. Also included the time-series prevalence rate for Hubei as a point of comparison. It begins at Day+11 because the Johns Hopkins data picks up when the province already had 444 cases. Comparing with other provinces and nations which experienced similar rates of growth, shifting that to 11 days seemed like a reasonable adjustment. The main takeaways in this chart are that 1) the U.S. has now crossed over the prevalence rate for Hubei at this (imputed) point in its outbreak, and 2) many countries' rates of growth appear to be flattening as the impacts of social distancing and travel restrictions can be observed in the data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My son is only just 4, but I #8217;m weaning him into this. When we play a game, I ask,  #8220;Do you want to play for fun or with the rules? #8221; If he wants to play for fun, I #8217;ll fudge things and give him an advantage. But if we play by the rules, then he has to keep playing even if I #8217;m winning (which he hates, but  #8220;those are the rules #8221;). He #8217;s not the most gracious loser atm, but improving. Hopefully by the time he #8217;s 5/6 losing won #8217;t be such a big deal for him. I did something similar with my stepson when he was ~7 and wanted to learn chess. I would ask if he wanted me to teach or if he just wanted to play. If he wanted me to teach, then I would coach him through moves, and usually let him win. But if he wanted to play a proper game, I #8217;d keep track of the board and then walk him through this mistakes after he lost. It took him a while to get comfortable with losing (a lot), but now he #8217;s kind of a beast at chess. tl;dr, Hugely important to teach kids about how to deal with losing and get them to up their game on their own - and they usually will!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Position and salary data are from the [U.S. House of Representatives, Statements of Disbursements, 2019](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements). Cleaned in Excel, plotted with Flourish ([interactive link](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1864438/)). Sortable by Representative and position category. Plotted positions were limited to those who were employed both full-time and for the full year (ie, January-December 2019). In other words, interns, part-time staff, fellows, detailees, shared staff, or staffers who either joined after January and/or left before December are not plotted. Positions were also limited to those in Representatives' personal offices; however, staff who received additional compensation from holding positions on committees or in leadership organizations have that noted in the interactive version. The plot does not, however, capture additional benefits or reimbursements staffers may have received during the year (eg, travel allowances). Congressional offices use a wide variety of titles to describe their staff. I sorted the official titles into commonly used hierarchical bands based on a combination of the official title, their apparent salary relationship within the office structure, and personal experience working in/with the House and the described roles' usual duties. Having said that, some offices use fairly vague titles, or titles that don't fully capture the staffers' responsibilities or relationship to their specific Boss; so there are some discrepancies from one office to the next. However, when I random-sampled the data, I was pretty satisfied with how the titles got sorted at-large. The interactive version of the visualization allows you to explore the distributions by Representative and by band. But again, because I only plotted staffers who were employed by the office for the full year AND who were not part-time or shared staff, some offices might only have a handful of points, which is not reflective of their full staff capacity. Also worth noting when looking at this data: The [median, individual income in the U.S. is $33,700](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N), while [the per capita income in the D.C. metro area is $49,400](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US47900-washington-arlington-alexandria-dc-va-md-wv-metro-area/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Position and salary data are from the U.S. House of Representatives, [Statements of Disbursements, 2019](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements). Cleaned in Excel, plotted with Flourish ([interactive link](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1878904/)). The interactive version of the visualization allows you to explore the distributions by Representative and by position band. This is a different look at the data [from the viz I posted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fxqb1z/oc_2019_salary_distributions_in_the_us_house_of/). This one annualizes the salaries of all Representatives' employees who were not otherwise interns, part-time, fellows, detailees, or shared staff, regardless of whether they were in the office for the full year. This allows for a more complete look at the range of salaries certain positions go for in the House and for a more complete examination of what Representatives pay their staff. I also filtered out what appeared to be one-time payments or people whose time in the office appeared to be less than a month (otherwise you had some people making an annualized $600k/year for a one-time payment of $2,000). Despite this filtering, there were still a few instances where the partial year salaries ran over the House employee salary cap on an annualized rate, requiring me to force them down; but these were largely at the Chief of Staff level (most of whom are at the cap anyway). There are still a couple of artifacts in the bands, but that's largely owed to the way certain staffers' titles didn't fully or accurately describe the duties of their position. Positions were also limited to those in Representatives' personal offices; however, staff who received additional compensation from holding positions on committees or in leadership organizations have that noted in the interactive version. The plot does not, however, capture additional benefits or reimbursements staffers may have received during the year (eg, travel allowances). Congressional offices use a wide variety of titles to describe their staff. I assigned these titles to commonly used hierarchical bands based on a combination of the staffers' title, their apparent salary relationship within the office structure, and personal experience working in/with the House and the described roles' usual duties. Having said that, some offices use fairly vague titles or titles that don't fully capture the staffers' responsibilities or relationship to their specific Boss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The statements don #8217;t say where the staffers are based. You can reasonably infer that field representatives, constituent services and district directors are in the state, with LAs and LDs in DC but some Representatives also like to have comms and chiefs out in the states most of the time. This was limited to full time positions as best as I could identify them. The axes are more legible in the link.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unemployment data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) ([latest report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)) and the [Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE). Starts of recessions defined by the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/cycles.html) (excepting the current one, which has not yet been formally declared). This graph captures how much higher unemployment rates climbed during periods of recession and then how long it took for rates to return to pre-recession levels (if they did). It's assumed at this point that the U.S. has entered into a recession, but it's unlikely to be formally declared by NBER for several months. Unemployment rates for the Great Depression have not been plotted because it blows out both axes and makes it impossible to discern all but the current recession and the GFC. Made with Excel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Source:** [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/). Filtered to original tweets and replies. The archive's search engine allows you to filter out retweets, which, per above, I did. However, Trump will often "RT" via an original tweet, which eludes the filter. I made the decision to keep those tweets in, since there's that little bit of extra effort involved. I chose the breaks in the color gradient so as to best reflect the change in his tweeting volume over time, particularly the ramping up from 2019 into this year. I heavily debated adding in the event annotations on the right of the heatmap; however, I decided to do it in order to pull some of the spikes out of the noise and contextualize the overall ebb and flow of Trump's Twitter activity. I tried to be neutral in the events I selected, or show position contrasts over time. However, certainly by 2018-19, he was tweeting about so many different things that isolating anything was a subjective exercise. And while the data is current through 27 May, I'm pretty sure he snuck a few tweets in after I started pulling this together; so, 27 May 2020 itself might be an undercount. Made with Excel, edited in [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the link. Wasn't aware of that before. The problem I ran into with the scale was that a simple two-tone scale (which is my preferred) wasn't doing a really good job capturing the intensity flow. Trump's lifetime, daily median is 7 tweets/day; but when he exceeds the median (as he now regularly does), he often blows it out of the water. Using common scaling tended to make the median indistinguishable from days where he only tweeted once or twice. Likewise, at the top of the scale, it was hard to tell between the days when he tweeted 30 times or 80 times. So, I resorted to mashing two together as a way to show the difference in intensity above and below the median. Admittedly not ideal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, if we're assuming that neither person *actually* was posing a physical threat to the other in the argument, then whomever pulled the gun in the first place had better live in a state with loose "stand your ground" laws that can justify their "feeling" threatened over any actual threat. But, sure, once both people have guns pointed at each other, they have until the cops show up to either exercise self-defense (because, Your Honor, that dude pointed a fucking gun at me!), or be adults and calm the fuck down (and hope that nobody called the cops). Honestly, it would depend heavily on the specific circumstances (and, more likely, how good each gunslinger's attorney is).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same, but not even smartphones. Once the Internet and personal computing transitioned from obscurity to household staple, I feel like that was the end. In 1994, only 1 in 20 households had Internet access. By 2001, it was closing in on half; and, I think the way we were engaging with each other and the world was already starting to change. Once smartphones showed up, it was just an easier and more personal way for people to get their fix. Then social media finished us off.</TEXT>

I took a vacation to Australia to clear my head after a bad burn-out episode. I fell in love with the vibe of the country, and applied for a visa as soon as I got back. I really don't like saying this: but, the more I observe America from afar, the less and less I think it's gonna sort its shit out.

    <TEXT>And I largely agree with you on that. For me, though, the problems run deeper than just Trump, for which I quote George Washington's Farewell Address:  #8203;  gt;The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty. Toppling Trump is an important step, sure, but I don't have any reason to believe that Republicans are going to suddenly decide to be conciliatory in defeat; nor, frankly, do I believe many Democrats will be gracious in victory. I mean, if Republicans lose the Senate, is McConnell going to start playing nice? Unlikely, at which point the Dems will probably nuke the filibuster, which will play right into the Republican' messaging which initiated Trumpism: "The Democrats want to obliviate your political voice!" And if they don't nuke the filibuster, then Dems aren't going to be able to accomplish anything, which is just gonna piss of the Left to say, "We told you not to trust Biden! He's too moderate!" and risk fracturing the coalition (which will be the same line if Republicans keep the Senate). Sure, Biden will be good for healing and repairing a lot of the damage, but on a fundamental level... I just struggle to see America's path out of tribalism, which is killing it from the inside. At which point, I quote Franklin:  #8203;  gt;Sir, I agree to this Constitution with all its faults, if they are such; because I think a general Government necessary for us, and there is no form of Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered, and believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in Despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic Government, being incapable of any other. And, again, in the sincerest hopes that my intuition is wrong.</TEXT>

Once I had to change my son in a parking lot (long story), and a woman came up to me full of concern and asked if I wanted her to do it for me. Like... No, I can manage a diaper, thanks.

It's expressive. Isn't that the point of music?" Anyway... I remember the early-90s recession. Dad was unemployed into '94, and things were... Lean. And being in the D.C. suburbs, I ***definitely*** recall the stories of how bad things were in the city when crime was peaking (our house got broken into three times that I can remember, twice while we were sleeping inside). And so, yeah, as an adult now, a lot of the tint has worn off of the glasses; and, I understand that there were a great many systemic problems that have carried over into today. I guess I was just in that lucky gap of youthful naivete where, despite the problems, I had that feeling of, "There's nothing we can't fix if we really try." Now I just look at my son and am like, "God, I hope we don't fuck it up any worse for you."</TEXT>

My mom has spent a good 25 years on our family records, and about three years ago I picked up on a few lines where she had left off. The data for this chart is limited to my direct line (ie, no cousins, aunts/uncles, etc.) and only for those where I have a high degree of confidence in locations and years of birth and death. No good explanation yet for the apparent decline in longevity across the generations from 1725-1874, as [there aren't enough data points](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/hs0gej/oc_lifespans_of_my_direct_known_ancestors/fy7n68e/) to really do subgroup analysis. At some point in the future, I'll incorporate distant relations to see if the pattern holds; and then, maybe, I'll have enough data to tease out what's going on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This only charts direct ancestors; so, there's an inherent survivor bias of people who lived long enough to reproduce to eventually arrive at yours truly. If I start incorporating the distant relations, that would include many relations who never made it to adulthood (or even beyond infancy) to have offspring. I just haven't gotten around to plugging in all of their data, because I've got literal hundreds of known indirect, distant relations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's correct. For centuries, many parents wouldn't even bother to name their kids until they got to about two or three years old and looked like they had a chance of surviving. Even these days, infant/child mortality peaks before 5 years, after which it drops dramatically.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are definitely gaps in reliable records for my family from around 1600. My paternal grandfather's lineage might as well have emerged from the Earth in 1700 for the lack of reliable records before that time. Fortunately, for the information I do have, I can pretty reliably trace families moving from UK shires into the cities, migrating to the U.S., and then spreading out from the ports to the interior. It's not particularly *dramatic* migration, since, yeah, there are several decades where everybody stays put lol; but, I think I have enough to pull off something worthwhile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This might be far a-field, but *Gargoyles* (1994-97). Yes, the Disney cartoon. As a kid, I just found myself really captivated by the characters' growth over the episodes and seasons, which was not like any other show I was watching at the time. That planted the seed in me to think about the power of good storytelling. I met the show's creator years later, and he talked a lot about his own passion for storytelling and its importance, and that really resonated with me. In the first instance, it led me to fiction writing; but, eventually, it morphed into screenwriting, which I've found more fulfilling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Easiest first step is to make a list of every movie, TV show, and book (yes, books) you enjoy and find the common threads. Are you drawn to drama, romance, action, fantasy, etc.? Then try to write the things you're naturally drawn to. Then write them again. Then again and again and again. And abandon the idea of "perfection." "Perfect" means you've learned everything there is to learn and have executed it flawlessly, which is maybe not "never" going to happen, but probably not ever going to happen. Don't let "perfect" get in the way of "good." "Good" you can turn into "better" until eventually arriving at "best."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dad was a journalist and professional writer for 35+ years. He once told me there's no such thing as writer's block as long as your hands work. I thought that was some arrogant B.S.; but, his point was that if you can't write creatively in a moment, just write... something. Anything. Break away from your screenplay and write a journal entry. Go outside and write a description of your surroundings. Start reading a book, and then pick a point where you continue the story in your own way. None of this has to be brilliant, and it doesn't have to be related to your story. You just need to write *something* to keep working the muscles. For me, people watching was the best cure. Find somewhere public (that might maybe have people these days) and think about who the people around you could be as characters. Think about how you'd describe them. Jot down snippets of conversation. Again, you're not going for brilliance or trying to spark a new story, you're just working the brain. And when you do feel a moment of inspiration for your story, don't be afraid to start in the middle. Find the scene that is speaking to you loudest, and go for it. Just because a story has a beginning, middle, and end, that doesn't mean you have to write it in that order. Hell, write OUTSIDE the story if you have to. What happened before and after? What's happening between the scenes? But, yeah, in time I've figured out that Dad was right. The best way to overcome writer's block is to just write.</TEXT>

The liberal model takes a "negative" view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government.

To make this a measure of liberal democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.

    <TEXT>Cool story, except he didn't say they weren't effective. He actually said, explicitly, in the *60 Minutes* interview in March, they were important for people who were infected to prevent spreading the disease - which was then his point. He was telling healthy people to save masks for the people who needed it. Then research on asymptomatic carriers was published from mid-late March, and the guidelines changed. Imagine that: Scientist gets more evidence, updates position accordingly. If only other people could do that.</TEXT>

But in high school, I just hit brick walls mentally, academically, and physically; so, I didn't want to embarrass myself applying to the Air Force Academy knowing I'd be shot down. Right after 9/11, I considered enlisting and then seeing if I could go in via OCS; but, a veteran recommended that since I'd already been accepted to college that I get a four-year degree first and then enter the services. But Iraq got into full swing, a friend got wounded in combat, I became an anti-war leftie, and that was the end of my childhood dream. Pretty sure I broke my granddad's heart and let down kid-me at the same time. Feels bad, man.</TEXT>

The mechanic's initial assessment was that a control unit/module had gotten fried because he wasn't able to get a report with his diagnostic tools. It was probably going to cost more to replace/repair than the car was worth. So, I'd been looking around for a new (used) car, which was going to be a financial hassle. On Monday, the mechanic called and said that he'd given the car another look and identified a disconnected wire - fixed and good to go. Saved me having to buy a car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, yes. Absolutely. I was working at the Department of Justice under the "leadership" of an absolutely horrible, horrible career senior executive. Verbally abusive, impossible to satisfy, ever-changing demands, nitpicky... Just horrible. Everyone in her office was absolutely miserable (except for the disabled combat veteran who was absolutely not going to get fired for anything and close to retirement anyway who had exactly zero fucks to give - he was a cool dude, I miss him). However, it was my first **real** job that had the potential for a quick rise in the ranks. I tried so hard to put up with her shit and survive long enough for an opportunity to jump over to somewhere else in the Department. The stress of going into the office was so bad that I would start to get physically sick on the way in. One day, she got under my skin and berated me over something so fucking asinine that I couldn't hold my tongue. I called her out for being a horrible human being, said I was quitting, and dropped my badge on my supervisor's desk as I walked out. My supervisor called me the next morning and asked if I would reconsider resigning. I said I wouldn't. He said, "Good, because she was going to formally fire you if you did." Spent the next four months doing temp/freelance work until I got a permanent gig, but ditching that place was 100% fucking worth it.</TEXT>

But, I was fully prepared to have to ask my parents to move back in with them "a failure" than deal with that level of toxicity. However, it did take me most of a month to get my first bit of temp work. In that time I did a LOT of second guessing; but, the permanent job I ended up getting was worth the break in employment.

Even if it's only been a handful (that we know of), it shouldn't be one. Like... That's not just an, "Oops." Moreover, we know that the existence of the death penalty does not deter serious offenders anyway; so, from a policy level, what's the point? But. But. Monsters who prey on the most vulnerable members of society are very real, and it's difficult for me to say with full conviction that they shouldn't be executed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing, because all the authority figures in my life told me to "Just ignore it." They never told me HOW, though, given that the bullies at school were also my neighbors, and at times the kids of my parents' friends, so it was pretty relentless. I thought things would change at boarding school, but nope. My social awkwardness made me a prime target up until about my junior year when everyone just kinda lost interest in me. So... That's why I'm teaching my son boxing. I'll make sure he knows never to start a fight, but I'll be damned if he won't know how to finish one.</TEXT>

Every fucking facet of American society has not just been politicized, but weaponized for political effect. I've made dedicated study of how democracies collapse into failed states, and America is ticking a fuck-ton of boxes right now. If it keeps on this path, America will be the first advanced democracy to crumble in the absence of foreign invasion; and I just don't think America has what it takes to pull itself back from the brink.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chiefly, zero-sum mentality. Neither the U.S. nor Russia is willing to concede that doing something which may give the other a short-term benefit may have long-term mutual benefits. Deeper than that, Russia has several hundred years of suspicion and wariness towards the traditional European powers that were always diplomatic complications. The US got roped into that field following its intervention in the Russian Civil War and unto whom those were fully transferred post-WWII. NATO and the EU #8217;s quick expansion following the collapse of the Soviet Union were taken as a kind of neo- #8220;Containment #8221; policy that harkened back to the legacy of European powers trying to diminish and deny Russia #8217;s sphere of influence on the continent. The US, meanwhile, for all its surface level sparring with European nations on an issue by issue basis, is just too entangled in preserving the status quo of Europe to wilfully give an inch to Russia #8217;s strategic interests (namely, expanding its grip over Europe #8217;s energy market) - at least until recently. And, you know, it #8217;s pretty hard to trust someone who #8217;s ready to vaporise large portions of your country on a moment #8217;s notice - and good luck convincing the hawks in either country to pursue full and unconditional denuclearisation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The crime on its own isn't enough. It has to be demonstrated that the crime was committed specifically because of the offender's prejudice towards the victim by virtue of their race, [etc](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute amp;Search_String= amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.085.html). Just shouting, "I'm a white supremacist!" and then punching someone doesn't necessarily show prejudice against the victim - especially when the victim, in this case, was also white (gender is not explicitly protected in Florida). This is, by the way, why [hate crimes can be difficult to prosecute](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/31/us/hate-crimes-charges-motive/index.html).

Yet, as your comment illustrates, Congress and the public don #8217;t like  #8220;the bureaucracy, #8221; so they force Departments to shovel tens of billions to private companies who might take just as long to deliver a shitty product.

    <TEXT>Data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://census.gov/), American Community Survey (2018, 5-year estimates). Made with Excel, [Mapchart](https://mapchart.net/), and [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/). The values represent the difference between the share of persons aged 25 and over holding a Bachelors degree or higher, by gender. That is, if 55% of females aged 25+ in a county hold a Bachelors+ versus 50% of males, then the gap is +5% female. Zoomed out at the national level, there are some noticeable clusters; however, the distribution otherwise appears random. Some patterns become evident when counties are clustered by population density, income, and non-white population.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's one of the interesting things I found. If you look specifically at the urban cores, the levels of attainment are fairly close to parity, or only slightly favor one gender over the other. But it's in the suburbs immediately outside those cores where you tend to see the gap favor males before it swings back in the very rural areas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The smaller graphs cluster the counties by properties which I found had some appreciable correlation to variances in the attainment gap (specifically, the county's median household income, racial composition, and population density). They illustrate that rural, non-white, and low-income counties tend to have larger shares of women with post-secondary attainment vs. men, whereas urban, white, high-income counties tend to have larger shares of men with post-secondary degrees. If you have a general idea of U.S. geography and macro demographics, you can sorta pick these out through the noise on the map. For example, the suburban counties of the Northeastern cities are green (ie, larger share of males with degrees) while the urban cores are closer to parity; whereas the Cotton Belt counties in the Southeast which are low-income and/or non-white are deep purple (ie, larger share of females with degrees).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kind of counter-intuitively, I think the easiest explanation lies in the fact that they're among the few states where men outnumber women (not wildly, but still). In terms of absolute numbers, it's not that women overwhelmingly have more degrees than men (+10k in Alaska, +11k N.D.). However, because women make up a smaller share of the states' populations (which are small to being with), those margins significantly boost their share. As to WHY more women, in absolute numbers, have degrees than men in both states, I'd imagine the factors are multifold, and relates to why the balance strongly favors women in almost every rural area. My working hypothesis - without any evidence at this point - is that men in rural areas are more easily able to enter the workforce without college education, whereas it's a more essential career step for women in rural areas. THAT or men from rural areas who do get college degrees are more easily able to get jobs in urban areas than women. Or some combination thereof. Not sure of either at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>American demographic and region definitions data from [the U.S. Census Bureau.](https://census.gov/) RNC and DNC speaker lists pulled from publicly available media. Demographic data for speakers pulled from multiple public sources, as available. Election data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election#Results_by_state). Charts made with Excel, stitched together with Pixlr. Age was considered, but not possible due to unavailable data for speakers who were not otherwise political figures. Speakers' race was given preference by how speakers identified themselves in any available biographies or interviews; otherwise, imputed based off available biographic information.

Yard signs are dirt cheap. I've worked on multiple campaigns. Most field offices have literally thousands of yard signs just piled up in every conceivable nook and cranny. You can just call 'em up for one. "Someone took your sign? Jerks. Well, we'll have a volunteer over in about 30 minutes with a new one. Thanks for your support. Do you want two this time? Three?

    <TEXT>Not *necessarily*. There's evidence of people understanding the [camera obscura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura) (ie, "pinhole camera") concept as far back as 2500 years, with its use well documented by 500 years ago. A popular (contested) theory for the Shroud of Turin is that it was an example of a camera obscura being used to create an image on the linen. Even if the photograph as eventually developed would have been beyond the layman 500 years ago, I think you could find some scholars in certain quarters who would understand the concept.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is this percent change from the preceding quarter? If so, there's not much that's "suspicious" at all. Let's index China's economy at the start of the outbreak (which was end of 2019Q4, btw) to 100. So, that 10% decline takes it down to 90. Now, let's assume that because China shut down hard and early, it was able to quickly resume pre-outbreak activity - ie, it goes back to 100. Well, 100/90 = 1.11, ie, **11%** growth over the previous quarter. While that represents a bigger quarterly change than the decline, in absolute terms, the economy has simply gone back to pre-outbreak normal - even though it would look like a wild 21 point swing on your chart (ie, from -10 to +11). If you consider that China's reopened economy likely got a marginal boost by being the only major economy no longer severely impacted by COVID (ie, supply chains shift to China), adding, say, an extra 3% over its pre-COVID activity, then: 103/90 = 1.14, or **14%** growth over the previous quarter. Again, sure, it's a bigger change than the decline, but hardly nefarious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)'s [database for general election polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls-page/president_polls.csv). Made with Excel. Pollsters were included if they had five or more polls from April through August of any of: all adults (a), registered voters (rv), or likely voters (lv). The 7-day rolling average for the Biden-Trump margin was calculated for each sample cohort using all available polls of each cohort in the available period (ie, there were three rolling averages: one for all adults, one for registered voters, and one for likely voters). Polling dates were calculated as the mid-point between the polls' start and end dates. Example: Ipsos ran a poll from 28 August to 1 September that included adults and registered voters. It found that among adults, Biden led +5; among registerd voters, Biden led +7. The poll's effective date was taken as 30 August. The running average Biden-Trump margin for all polls of adults for the seven days to 30 August was +9.05; for all polls of registered voters, +7.53. As such, Ipsos' poll for adults was recorded as a -4.05 deviation (ie, towards Trump), while its poll for registered voters was recorded as -0.53.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my best and most stressful starts to any CK game. Ever. Started as Viken, and was able to fight my way to get the Kingdom of Norway without too much trouble; but, all of his kids died along the way (both battle and illness). The deaths (and other events) jacked his stress that led to multiple mental breakdowns and resulted in severe health penalties. The only thing keeping him going was the care of his soulmate; and, when she died from a sudden illness, he died within two months (having lost her aid and attendance perk) at 56. Mercifully, one of his sons managed to have a son (before dying in battle) and, at 17, this grandson become the dynasty leader. But the kingdoms of Sweden and S #225;pmi had also formed, with Denmark and Finland not far behind; and, my vassals all had low opinions of me for my short reign. I was expecting to be toast. Somehow, though, the Jarls stayed obedient. Then a war-gone-wrong for Sweden resulted in multiple succession crises that allowed me (and some ambitious Jarls) to pick it up piecemeal\*. I wrecked the S #225;pmi in a defensive war from which they never fully recovered, and then grabbed a chunk of Denmark via a successful marriage/inheritance (and a well-plotted murder scheme). But Iceland buddied up to a crazy-powerful Alba, and Estonia made friends with Lithuania and Novgorod. Lotharingia was strong and holding the rest of Denmark to prevent me from forming the kingdom. Now in my mid-50s, obese and gout-ridden, and with fewer than 60 of the 92 counties I needed, I was resigned to having to leave the Scandinavia project to my successors (and losing all my gains in Sweden and Denmark). Then, within the space of a few months, the S #225;pmi fractured, and the King of Finland was killed in battle, leaving his eight-year-old son as the new king (and with all alliances voided). It was too good of an opportunity, so I went all-in - fully expecting to lose everything in an imminent succession. And yet, by the grace of Odin, I friggin' pulled it off. I subjugated the S #225;pmi, kicked Lotharingia out of Denmark in a ***long war*** with multiple allies on both sides, and chipped away at Finland. This screenshot shows me at 69 (yes... *and I heard that*) a mere three counties shy of being able to establish the empire (which were going to come out of what remained of Finland). Mindful that death could come at any moment, I was on the absolute edge of my seat as I sent my raiders out, feeling the race against the invisible clock. Every event notification made my heart stop, because I was entirely sure it was going to be notice of my death and the redistribution of all my gains. The raiders ended up bringing back about 1,000 gold, more than enough to finance the final push and subsequently found the empire in November 962. I don't think I've ever formed an empire within one century of the start date, so... Pretty happy with myself. Obviously, I'll still lose direct control over the various kingdoms on my death (I'm still tribal), but I'll keep the empire. That'll be more than enough for my successors to work with. \*The rightful king of Sweden is my vassal, now the Jarl of Munster. His play for Ireland while I was picking apart his core territory was ill-advised.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked at VA #8217;s central office on environmental exposure issues (eg, Agent Orange, Gulf War) when the research was ramping up on burn pits. I understand the weight of evidence VA needs to make these illnesses presumptive, but it also boggles my mind that those presumptions haven #8217;t happened yet - either from VA or Congress (the latter of which, at least by the time I left VA, seemed pretty much ready to make it happen). The reports I read seemed to draw a pretty clear friggin #8217; line to say,  #8220;This is bad shit, and vets are gonna get sick. Cover them. #8221;</TEXT>

Considering that California would be one of the world's 40 largest countries if it were independent AND has some of the U.S.' most active (and historically active) air and sea ports, you would *expect* that it would have a measurably higher level of diversity than the less populous, less globally connected states. The relative size of those populations may not dramatically differ from one state to the next, but you would *expect* that the larger the state, the greater the likelihood of those communities existing in more easily measurable concentrations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, even with 35,000 respondents chosen using a random sampling method, they know that they are still unlikely to get a cohort that's perfectly representative of the population as a whole. So they adjust for that by comparing their respondents' demographics (eg, age, race, gender, education, etc.) to Census data and adjust how much each respondent "counts" towards forming a "representative" sample. I did the idiot sandwich thing and misread the codebook and assumed that those weights were only relevant for the respective subgroups, so now I'm probably gonna delete this because I've pretty badly fucked up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In order for Pew to bring its survey in-line with the demographic composition of the U.S., it adjusts the values of respondents' answers by variables such as age, gender, education, etc. That's called weighting. If you just look at the responses alone, that's called the "unweighted" data. When I read the codebook, I had taken away that I needed to apply those weights if I was analysing the respondents within those specific categories rather than at the population level. Going back to the codebook thanks to that comment thread, and it's obvious that Pew advised to use the weighting at all times. So I fucked up pretty badly.</TEXT>

Data parsed in Excel, maps made with [MapChart](https://mapchart.net/). * Maps of populations identifying with Christian denominations are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/iy83ld/oc_statelevel_population_shares_of_christian/). * Map of population "unaffiliated" with religion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/iy7tre/oc_statelevel_population_shares_reporting_no/). Updated and reposted because I'm an idiot sandwich. When I first read the codebook that comes with the data package, I mistook the weights as applying to subgroups (ie, gender, age, education, etc.). But, after u/Emergency-Salamander and u/lokujj inquired about discrepancies they noticed in my scales versus what was on Pew's website, I went back and... Yeah, the codebook was pretty clear that the weights should be applied in ALL analyses. Idiot sandwich. While my error in using the unweighted data didn't result in WILD deviations (90% of the deviations were within +/- 0.7%), and the overall distributions remain largely unchanged, it was regardless not a faithful reflection of the data (with, yes, a handful of EGREGIOUS deviations - sorry, Jews of Rhode Island, but you weren't as thicc as thought). I couldn't in good conscience keep those maps up. I apologize for the very rookie error. As such, these maps use the WEIGHTED data, as recommended by Pew; and, I've done some random testing to compare my weighting to what Pew reports on their website. I'm confident I've got it right this time, but please call me out if you think I've made new mistakes. To clear a couple of other things up: The single biggest complaint I got on these maps in the first go was, "They're not using the same scale!" Yes. I know that. That's... That's the point. These maps are not meant to compare these religions to each other. The point of these maps is to show WHERE these religions are most strongly represented within state populations, not to compare WHICH is stronger. I'm not saying that a map that would show the relative sizes of these religions against each other wouldn't be VALID, I'm just saying that's not what I'm presenting. Moreover, forcing all the religions onto a common scale will result in a map of Judaism with a couple of pockets of Islam, and not much else (RIP, Hindu). If you don't believe me, go ahead and check out Pew's interactive maps (which inspired me to make these in the first place) which use a single scale for the major non-Christian faiths. Enjoy the uniform, pale blue in every state. So in order to get around that, you would have to manipulate the scale to over-compensate for the smaller pockets in order to ensure their representation; and, I feel like using a forced scale is far worse than just... Having four different scales for four, plainly different maps so that it's clear that they're - you know - DIFFERENT and so should be compared against each other with caution and diligence. I did, however, meet you halfway and standardised the Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu scales. The second biggest complaint I got was, "I don't believe it! I've lived in Blah-Blah for One-Hundred Eleventy years, and I've never met one of THEM!" All I have to say to that is: do your own damn 35,000 person survey and share your results with the rest of the class.</TEXT>

However, this was both previously planned and one of the most requested visualizations in the comments of the other two. And from the experience of the previous two posts, to anticipate the most likely critique, "They're not using the same scale!" Yes. I know that. That's... That's the point. These maps are not meant to compare the Christian denominations against each other. The point of these maps is to show WHERE the denominations are most strongly represented within state populations, not to compare WHICH is stronger. I'm not saying that a map that would show the relative sizes of these religions against each other wouldn't be VALID, I'm just saying that's not what I'm presenting. Moreover, forcing all the denominations onto a common scale would result in a map of Evangelicals in the South, Mainline Protestants in the North, and not much else other than some Catholics in New England. So in order to get around that, you would have to manipulate the scale to over-compensate for the smaller pockets in order to ensure their representation; and, I feel like using a forced scale is far worse than just... Having four different scales for four, plainly different maps so that it's clear that they're - you know - DIFFERENT and so should be compared against each other with caution and diligence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My anecdotal understanding is that Buddhism attracts a lot of Native Americans who get detached from their traditional faiths. I haven't found hard evidence to confirm that or explain why that would be the case, though, so... Take that for what it is. (Also would raise questions about why Buddhism isn't as prevalent in Arizona or the Dakotas) I might also posit that Buddhism appeals to people who might like the remote/rugged nature of New Mexico and Alaska.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)'s American Community Survey (2014) and Pew Research Center's [Religious Landscape Study (2014)](https://www.pewforum.org/dataset/pew-research-center-2014-u-s-religious-landscape-study/). Made in Excel. The chart uses the weighted data (as recommended by Pew), but the raw numbers have been presented for the sake of completeness (and hopefully to indicate why I went with whole-of-group stacks versus sizing each according to its number of respondents). The 2014 ACS was chosen to ensure like-like data for the years in which the surveys were conducted. Also, Pew's study included the attainment category, "Some postgraduate or professional schooling," which the Census Bureau does not. So, I condensed that with "Bachelor #8217;s degree," since, with few exceptions, attaining a Bachelor's is a pre-requisite to commencing postgraduate study. Whether the comments were snarky or genuine, this was the most requested visualisation from my "series" on the distributions of religious groups in the U.S. using Pew's data (chiefly in the comments sections of the maps I ended up having to nuke for inaccuracy shortly after they landed on the front page - which was just *great*). So... Here ya go, as requested. Presented without further commentary, because yup.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For HBP, when you consider their [geographic distribution](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/iy83ld/oc_statelevel_population_shares_of_christian/) (**large image warning**), it's concentrated in areas of notoriously low attainment. For Catholics, I'm not totally sure. My first instinct was that it might be a function of age; and while the Catholic population did tend to be a bit older, the difference wasn't very significant, nor was there a stark difference in Catholics' attainment by age. But even with a pretty decent sample size, prodding subpopulations of subpopulations is tricky. **Edit:** On investigation, it looks like low attainment among Latin American migrants may be the biggest contributing factor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Certainly there's a difference between native-born and migrant attainment; but, at that point, you'd be diving into subpopulations (nativity) of subpopulations (education) of subpopulations (religion), and that'll get you VERY high degrees of uncertainty. Also, as far as I'm concerned, if they're in the country, then they're in the country, and they count. Atheists are covered in the "unaffiliated" category (which Pew defined as including agnostics, atheists, and "nothing in particular").</TEXT>

    <TEXT>idk, why did McConnell strip individual direct payments out of the Democrats #8217; bill after he #8217;d sat on it for four months? Because Republicans WERE ALWAYS going to try to use this as leverage over Democrats once the election got close. Congrats. You got played.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, serious answer: Because Democrats want a comprehensive stimulus package, because all the evidence we have about direct payments to individuals shows that the social and economic benefits are fleeting. Yes, sure, those deeply affected can (and will) use the $1,200 to pay overdue bills, rent, and put food on the table (and maybe get some extra consumables). But with no relief for businesses, temporary layoffs will become permanent job losses that will have ramifications once the pandemic is over. Without support for local governments, critical services that are helping people affected by the pandemic will be cut. $1,200 right in people #8217;s pockets sounds nice, but it #8217;s not even a short-term solution. It was supposed to be a stopgap measure until either 1) the pandemic eased and/or 2) longer-term relief could be put in place, which was the point of the Democrats #8217; original bill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Why are all of our representatives okay signing off on an ineffective direct payment anyway?" Because they know that voters want it, efficacy be damned. Voters will **always** choose money in their pockets versus other, more structured recovery plans. That's why McConnell stripped direct payments out of his "skinny" bill, which he waited until last month to present, because he wanted to force Democrats to take an either-or position ahead of the election. And to Pelosi/Dems' point: Yes, Americans do need direct payments. That's why direct payments SHOULD be covered. But if you don't do direct payments at the same time as provide then other protections, then that wealth transfer will evaporate at the same time as businesses fold and local services are cut, ULTIMATELY leaving people worse off. It has to happen at the same time. You can't give people $1,200 now, wait until January to restart negotiations with a new president/Congress, and then try another rescue package in February after the damage has been done (and when people might also need $1,200 **again**, because they've gone from being temporarily laid off to permanently laid off after their business folded).</TEXT>

The US peaked at 75,682 in July and remain around 50,000 per day. Adjusting for population, France #8217;s current max is *just* higher than the U.S. #8217;s max (27.9 cases / 100000 vs. 23.7). Moreover, France eased its restrictions in June when the government ended the state of emergency when daily new cases had fallen to the low hundreds (a rate the US has never gotten near by orders of magnitude). That was obviously a mistake, and so new restrictions and mandates have steadily come back into effect from July.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bruv, nah, I really need you to level with me on this one. CDC was friggin' hamstrung from day dot. [Trump's first budget as President](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5468112/) called for massive cuts to the CDC and public health that only barely got ignored by Congress - [but he persisted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/01/cdc-to-cut-by-80-percent-efforts-to-prevent-global-disease-outbreak/). [He removed CDC staff in China](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/23/21190713/coronavirus-trump-china-cdc-embed-quick) who were there *precisely* to be America's sentinels for just such an event like the one we're in. [He completely ignored all preparedness efforts](https://www.wired.com/story/an-oral-history-of-the-pandemic-warnings-trump-ignored/). Public health experts were calling for massive testing and travel restrictions [in February](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/coronavirus-news-january-and-february-2020/). Evidence about asymptomatic carriers wasn't affirmed [until mid-late March](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30917-X/fulltext#back-bib10), [soon after which CDC updated its guidance](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/03/826219824/president-trump-says-cdc-now-recommends-americans-wear-cloth-masks-in-public). This whole time, experts have been doing their best to follow the evidence and provide advice as best to their abilities. But I mean... Scientists vs. Donald Trump and his cult? They weren't prepared for that kind of fight. They weren't ready for a President - *a President!* \- to loudly second guess their work, amplified by his bros in the right-wing media. Friggin' [Sinclair Media was ready to air Plandemic](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/25/media/sinclair-pulls-fauci-conspiracy-segment/index.html). He had to be dragged kicking and screaming to release any kind of national guidelines, which he pulled as soon as he got bored. There have been multiple resignations because [these scientists have been made to literally fear for their lives](https://www.governing.com/now/Why-Public-Health-Officials-Are-Quitting-During-a-Pandemic.html) because of the Trumpists. If they're not being loud enough, it's because they know full well that the government doesn't have their backs if they get threatened (much less if The Don chooses to make it personal). Nah, man. Don't blame the scientists and front-line professionals on this one. The fault is at the feet of one man and his sycophants.</TEXT>
