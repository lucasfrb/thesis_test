    <TEXT>The Polycount set hats were pretty much the best metal sink in the game, even though not many people seem interested in admitting it since there was so much clamor to get those set bonuses removed. As new players came into the game and realized how useful the bonuses were, metal remained a desirable commodity since it was used to craft them with the guaranteed set hat recipe. The only other alternative was purchasing the sets from the store or gambling on an unbox from certain crates. I'm not suggesting that Valve add in another Polycount set type item, but I definitely agree with /u/Lemon_Nade in that a temporary solution isn't what we're after here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much exactly this. The vast majority of experienced MvM players aren't playing it because they really love the missions or just have a ball every time they sit down for a game, they're grinding for aussies and pro kit fabs. They don't want to waste their time with rando one-tour Pyros who want to come in with a degreaser/detonator/back scratcher loadout or battle Scouts who dodge the money and throw all their upgrade cash into their winger. After doing the same thing six or seven hundred times, it gets down to a science and they know what works and what doesn't. I'm not necessarily defending anyone's behavior when it comes to MvM, but that's pretty much the best answer to the question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**VGC 2017** I'm looking for a team to play with on the 3DS for online competitions. I'm not new to the competitive scene but I'm very, very new to this format. I've been away from comp for a while -- I started in Gen IV, took a break during Gen V, came back during the early days of Gen VI and played like mad during VGC2014, then just got overwhelmed when ORAS hit and the meta shift made my old team unusable. I want to get used to the new VGC format since I'll be playing it a lot this year. My playstyle leans towards bulky offense/hyper offense and "goodstuff" teams, but I don't really know any of the new 'mons or Z-Moves or any of that, and once again I'm feeling overwhelmed. While I can IV breed and EV train and all that just fine, competent teambuilding itself (and doubles, really -- I'm way more familiar with Smogon OU than doubles) is a foreign concept to me. I'm very willing to learn, though. Garchomp's my competitive go-to for just about every team I've ever run, and this generation he feels like a no-brainer. In the past I paired him with Rotom-W but since that's out for now, I'm leaning towards bundling Garchomp with Gyarados for intimidate support in the hopes that Garchomp can scare off electric threats. I'm also interested in trying out Arcanine instead of Gyarados since Arcanine can run special and not be as worried about that -1 to Attack if enemy Intimidate shows up. Beyond that, I have no idea what else to put on a team. My Garchomp's about as boring ol' standard as it gets, and I usually run a Dragon Dance Gyarados. I'm open to item, move, etc. criticism -- rebreeding's no problem. Nothing's set in stone. **Garchomp @ Groundium Z** Ability: Rough Skin EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Earthquake - Dragon Claw - Poison Jab - Protect **Gyarados @ Wacan Berry** Ability: Intimidate EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Dragon Dance - Waterfall - Crunch - Ice Fang Any help would be absolutely appreciated. Thanks in advance! *Edit: formatting*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's no really objective answer. Hats and cosmetics aren't a necessity to play the game, but some people enjoy them and some people don't. It's a matter of personal preference. From a microtransaction standpoint, there are less expensive ways to obtain items than purchasing them from the store.

    <DATE>2017-08-26 21:52:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Platform(s):** PC (Windows) **Genre:** Puzzle games/brainteasers **Estimated year of release:** Sometime around the late 90s/early 00s **Graphics/art style:** Puzzle games, so not particularly impressive (pre-rendered sprites) **Notable characters:** Don't remember specific characters but I do remember the cover of the games had a mascot that looked like a nerdy man wearing some kind of high-tech helmet with a propeller **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Each game had a variety of puzzles/brainteasers; some of the games I remember were variations on Rock/Paper/Scissors, and a game where you had to seat people on an airplane while making sure certain criteria were fulfilled. I recall there being a number of games with each compilation, all of which were puzzles. **Other details:** This was a series of PC games. The most notable detail by far was the eccentric-looking mascot on the cover of each game. He was wearing a metal helmet with mechanical parts (looked vaguely like Louis Tully), usually had an Inspector Gadget-styled propeller sticking out of it if I'm remembering right. I'm sorry I don't have more details. I haven't played these games since I was very young. If anyone remembers them, I'd sure appreciate being pointed in the right direction of where to find a copy today. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've taken a shine to Twiss as of late. My advice for you is to play Twiss like a mage and focus on Prestige victories, though she can pull Rot victories off in a pinch if you draw well. I almost never pull into trickeries with Twiss because she tends to run cash poor unless you get lucky with the settlement game. I typically run Twiss with Favour (the +2 Prestige amulet) and either Amethyst (+1 magic for burned cards) or Celestite (no mountain movement penalties). As far as general playstyle goes, burn through spells as much as you can and focus on building Body and Spirit. You can grab one Wits if you feel like it, but 5's a really solid number for her anyway. Don't be afraid to get gutsy on quests. Avoid combat like the plague and spam spells like a monster. If you can get a kill, take it. Teleport and Banish are your best friends because you can use the former to snipe Spirit Stones/terrorized settlements/etc, while the latter is amazing for kicking would-be kingslayers out of the castle. Try to get to 5 Spirit as fast as you can because it's a really good sweet spot for most high-level, chunky spells. Hope some of this advice helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;forgot to say that this playstyle as Twiss will get you a lot of hate though (some people even refer it as the "Bitch Build") Can confirm. People WILL focus you as Twiss regardless of your position in the game. I was playing her last night and wasn't even close to winning, yet the other three players (a novice and two clearly experienced players) dogpiled me. New players will chase you down thinking you're easy pickings because of your low Fight (oftentimes unaware of how Evade works), and savvier players will go out of their way to keep you suppressed with magic and trickery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First and foremost, I find I get more mileage out of a magic Scarlet build than trying to skew towards trickery. This is entirely my personal preference and you might disagree, but I find that magic is, on average, more reliable as it completely resets every night whereas money only ticks up incrementally each day. If you need money, you can usually focus down heroes who have bounties or raid dungeons for cash. Sure, trickery can help you get money by robbing other heroes, but whereas magic is a guaranteed thing, you have to maintain ownership of towns for daily income and other heroes like Mercurio, Elyssia, and Zosha are far better designed for that. (It's also harder overall to take magic away from other heroes than it is to take their money, so it usually stays with you more as a resource.) Instead, if you think of Scarlet as the Bandit Clan's answer to Amber rather than the Bandit version of Mercurio, you'll have better insight as to how to play her. Her starting stats are pretty well-rounded -- 4/4/5/3 is really solid since 5 Wits is enough for palace peril matches + HRW if you ever need to rushdown the King, and 3 Spirit is a really good sweet spot for most magic in the spell deck. Any stat you want to lean towards can be easily buffed with an Amulet (I usually take Scratch with her and Celestite for my Ring), and you can spend your quests alternating between buffing Body and Fight to better your odds in combat.  gt; "I have only seen th incite revolt card. THRICE If we take that one match as one hour" Cub's Blood and Malice Rising are your best friends. You don't have to rely on fishing up Incite Revolt. Even if you're completely out of magic and money, Cub's Blood and Malice Rising can still be used. Yes, they "cost" Rot, but Rot is only a punishment if you choose to think of it that way. Me personally, I see it as a resource.  gt; "What makes her special ability usless is that it's unreliable." I couldn't disagree more. Her special ability is one of the most reliable in the game if you know how to use it. Continuing my comparison of Scarlet to Amber, Amber's special ability is unreliable and luck-based -- stepping on a dungeon might give you something good and it might give you a Bane and push you back. Scarlet's ability is guaranteed as long as you meet the conditions for it. If you're able to maintain the Prestige lead (which Scarlet is naturally inclined towards anyway with her ability and well-rounded stats), you can sway the King's Declarations towards terrorizing settlements. Mountains won't slow you down because you can use Celestite to get to settlements more quickly when other heroes might have a harder time (Mercurio and Elyssia, both settlement-grabbers, suffer from this). Just my two cents on the matter anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amber's gimmick is being well-rounded, similar to Scarlet. I wrote a somewhat detailed blurb on Scarlet recently, which you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/armello/comments/782uyo/will_the_total_and_absolute_uselessness_of/ Basically, Amber is tuned to be decent at most things but not particularly exceptional at any one thing. Her dungeon ability is not guaranteed (I still get plenty of Banes playing as Amber). You might try pairing it with the Spirit Stone amulet "Dig".  gt;How often do I focus and go out of my way for that? If a Dungeon is in your flight path, or it won't be the difference in whether you make it to your next quest "late" or not, then that's one thing. I wouldn't go out of my way to dungeon-crawl as Amber.  gt;Also, tips on being smoother with Brun. When you cast spells to buff your Fight, they're only good for one battle. Don't burn a ton of spells building your Fight unless you plan on using it; nothing sucks more than buffing yourself and then parking next to a Bane that wastes your buffs. Side note: you can also use his ability to buff your Fight stat, increasing the odds of getting items from the Fight quests you undertake. Fang and wolves in general (thanks to Rubellite) are both excellent for this.</TEXT>

The reason you can't use the strange transfer tools on any of your other stranges is that each strange in your backpack is different. You don't have two Medi Guns, two Kritzriegs, etcetera.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The unfortunate reality of this is that it's going to happen, and often. It's even worse when you deal with a three-stack that pretends to play fair for half the game right up until you start standing a chance of actually winning. This was my experience with Armello multiplayer for the longest -- getting one "good" game out of every five or six I played wasn't cutting it for me. The only way to truly combat it is to play with a friend of your own or join the Armello discord and ask for games in there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;surprisingly I mean, fandoms and skill level at a video game don't necessarily influence each other. Furries (and anime) are some of the oldest and largest fandom "cliques", both of which predate even the modern internet. This didn't happen just a couple of years ago, just because r/tf2 suddenly "discovered" a correlation between Spies and anime. Both furry and anime are big enough to routinely host large-scale conventions and gatherings all across the world, so if anything, I'm NOT surprised a number of them would actually be good at the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The biggest problem I have with this idea is that Armello has a hard enough time getting enough players together for a MP game as it is. With Fury Friday and Stranger Games splitting the queue on a regular basis, it's not at all uncommon to wait ten and fifteen minutes to get into a game (only to wind up as fodder for a three-player premade). Adding more novelty game modes = more separate queues. What would be nice is the option to queue for any type of game and take the "first available", rather than having to pick the one you want to play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think my biggest complaint with the way the decks are structured in Armello is that rarities seem to be picked arbitrarily and with no real sense of balance. I don't understand why the Cleansing Wyld is limited to two copies in the deck but there are four of Leech, when both are some of the best cards in the game. Banish and Teleport being rare makes sense, but why is Marauder's Gauntlets a unique card? To incentivize calling Simeon out to a settlement just in the hopes of being able to grab a second copy of it? Trickery is the same way -- Beheaded really doesn't need to be Unique, same for Vile Official. I'd bump both of those to Rare or maybe even Uncommon. And though this is adjacent to the point, Arson's cost is still too high as Ghor's ability is no longer kneecapped horrendously by the loss of a well-placed Forest tile in the middle of a spellcasting cluster. (Additionally, does Spirit Seeds still need to be so expensive to cast?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I wouldn't say Cleansing Wyld and Leech are "some of the best cards in the game". Respectfully I couldn't disagree more. In Cleansing Wyld's case, being able to get rid of Poison is a lifesaver because being poisoned can shut you out of potentially two entire turns depending on when it happens to you, but the real secret to its usefulness is being able to manipulate rot values, making it one of the few reliable counters to Corrupted heroes, which are an inevitability in the new Rot-heavy meta post-From Below. Similarly, Leech is fantastic not only for its healing abilities (especially if you luck into the Apothecary) but also for rot number manipulation, and its rarity in the deck makes it fairly reliable to pull into if you're trying to get Corrupted fast.  gt;cards like HRW and Teleport are leagues better in terms of value Well sure, no duh cards like HRW and Teleport are fantastic for utility, but they're not the be-all, end-all of Armello. If you're trying to get to quests or fight the king, they're certainly useful, but they can also be completely worthless depending entirely on your strategy. If you're settlement-hopping as Elyssia and locking the board down with Trickery while securing a Prestige victory or dungeon-diving as Diamond Amber, you're not often concerned with making it to all four of your quests and dueling the king.  gt;Marauder's Gauntlets is unique because it's one of the best equippables in the game, beating out most treasures and literally every normal equippable. I don't agree with "beating out most treasures" and I *sure* don't agree with "literally every normal equippable". Marauder's Gauntlets give you rot (which can be great, as I pointed out previously) but there are tons of scenarios in which the other equippables are more reliable. Twiss and an evading Rat in your game? Sailor's Lantern to shut off their evasion is better than one locked-in sword and one shield. Running a high-fight, low-body glass cannon like Ruby Mercurio or Ruby Zosha? King's Guard Armor and especially Battle Armor are going to be a lot more valuable to you than one more guaranteed hit. Playing Fang and front-loading as much damage as you can? Longbow and especially the Silver Lance are going to beat one guaranteed sword and one guaranteed shield because the name of the game is to do as much damage as you can to get to an overkill.  gt;As for Beheaded and Vile, both cards, imo, don't have a reason to exist. I'd be really curious to know what your playstyle is if you think Beheaded doesn't even have a reason to *exist*. It's one of the few play-to-hero Trickery cards in the whole deck and for the low cost of 1 Prestige, it can do up to *six damage* to any hero, anywhere on the board, including the Palace. Considering the median health of a late-game potential Kingslayer (not to mention the inevitability of The Stranger), it can be more reliable than Sharpshooter for kicking someone out of the Palace.  gt;adding even more cards to the deck via card rarities isn't a great idea. The deck needs to be smaller, not bigger. Not quite what I meant. My original point is that rarities seem arbitrary and aren't picked with any sense of balance in mind. I certainly don't think all the cards in the Trickery deck need to be bumped up, I think some of the better ones (and in my opinion, Beheaded is one of the better ones) need to have their quantities increased for a more reliable chance of getting them.  gt;Arson never really was a great Ghor counter You must not remember the terror that was Ghor in his prime, then. Arson was literally one of his greatest weaknesses and it existed solely to screw over a Ghor with a strong cluster.  gt;spirit seeds never being a great Ghor card either. Too rare, too expensive, and casting them don't do much. ...which is basically what I already said. I agree that it's horrendously expensive for what it does and it being a one-of doesn't make it reliable. It's a good concept, but like so many of the other cards in all three decks, it needs both its quantity and its cost reworked... which is, as I've stated twice now, my point in its entirety.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm an in-box collector for two main reasons: 1) I like how they look on the shelves in their boxes, and they're easier to stack, clean, and sort than they would be if I took them out of the packaging 2) I like the way the packaging *itself* looks, especially the art and logos on the front of the box That said, I do go out-of-box with some of my favorites (I put them in the Michael's baseball bat display cases). Collect however you like! Don't let someone tell you what you can or can't enjoy, and of course, badmouthing someone for not sharing your opinion is just as uncool. People who keep them in box aren't "money-grubbers" and people who take them out of the box aren't "fake fans". There's no wrong way to enjoy your hobby!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think your kids'll love them and more importantly, they'll love you for thinking of them. Don't be discouraged by embittered and burnt-out (adult) collectors who spin the Mystery Box roulettes expecting a Headless Ned Stark in every box.

Their packaging isn't terrible, but for a company that exclusively sells Funko Pops to Funko Pop collectors, it's worse than most eBay and r/funkoswap sellers I've bought from. I still have pops on backorder from them that ended up becoming *vaulted* before PIAB ever restocked. At this point, the only reason I'd ever buy from them is if they had an exclusive that I couldn't get anywhere else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For whatever it's worth, I can tell you're crazy passionate about Armello and that's a really good thing. But just from perusing some of your past memes, I've noticed you get dinged a few times for not getting card details or game mechanics quite right, and some of your "the experience" posts show an obvious disconnect between heroes you're less familiar with. And that's okay! Please don't feel like you have to force a format if you don't have the material (or the game experience) to make it work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, that wasn't worded well -- I should've been more clear re: "not getting details/mechanics quite right". My bad! I'm not saying you don't understand how the cards/mechanics work at all, but I am saying that your lack of experience with Armello's non-Magna meta as a whole definitely shows through in some of your memes, and it seems to often lead to disagreements and corrections in the comments sections of your posts. (Like that "Mercurio/Amber are useless base characters" hot take from a while back that you yourself immediately retracted right after posting.) As ever you're entitled to your opinions as much as anybody and the memes and red hot opinions can be good for fostering discussions -- like right here and right now with Sargon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A nice (albeit situational) and affordable counterpart to Banish if you need to move someone out of your way, or you plan to capture the settlement they're on for yourself. As also has been pointed out here, a cost-effective peril for defending buffed settlements you want to hold onto (an especially good target for Cursed Lands and/or Agents of Misfortune if that's the case). Generally, I get the most mileage out of playing it directly to a hero, especially as Elyssia when I don't favor my odds against a high-combat hero. Cost is in a good place, effect isn't too gamebreaking as it's *nearest* mountain rather than *furthest* -- my one complaint is that I think its rarity could afford to be bumped up slightly (there are a number of good disruptive trickery cards like this that are rare/unique that I feel could stand to be redistributed to make the deck more enticing to draw from).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've placed many orders through PPG Marketplace and yes, it's about as legitimate as eBay or Mercari are. You place an order with the site but you're purchasing from a private seller (usually an individual, sometimes a business) who will mail you your pop. I haven't had a single one come damaged in the mail, packaging is tremendous quality, but I've also had two orders canceled because the seller resold the pop somewhere offsite and couldn't fill the order. Overall, though, I've had very positive experiences.</TEXT>

A "modern" *Donald Duck* Pop that isn't from KH would be pretty nice, and I really, really want to see the rest of *Chip n Dale's Rescue Rangers* -- having only Monty doesn't feel right!

    <TEXT>Convention exclusives are the most personally frustrating aspect of Pop collecting in general for me -- as of the three lines I've been most excited about this year (Sour Patch Kids, Otter Pops, and Persona 5), two ended up getting con exclusives announced afterward that I knew would result in an exorbitant resale price to obtain. More relevant to pop hunting itself, I have two major issues: **1) I wish Funko would quit putting Chase figures in mystery boxes.** I'm fine with their mystery boxes in general as long as the distribution is relatively even (and to be fair, at least stores get an assortment now, as opposed to going to Gamestop only to come home with three of the exact same gray Mega Mans), but I hate being forced to gamble on multiple mystery boxes if there's a Chase I want and then ending up with a bunch of filler items I couldn't care less about (Batman socks, lanyards, the exact same Goof Troop pin over and over again, etc). **2) Stop releasing one Pop from a wave "early" and then waiting months or longer to release/announce the rest of them.** Last year's Black Friday mystery box really appealed to me because I'm a huge Disney Afternoon fan. It was the rare box in which I wanted just about everything out of it. Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers is one of the lines I've been most hyped for after the release of the action figures and mystery minis, and with Darkwing Duck and Ducktales getting those pop figures it felt like it was only a matter of time before we'd see the rest. When Monterey Jack dropped at Thanksgiving it seemed like a given the others were to follow (including the main characters themselves), and yet here it is in July of the following year and no more pops in the line have so much as been teased. Considering the fact that many of those boxes are still commonly available in Gamestop even today, I'm a little worried they didn't sell well enough for Funko to feel like producing the others would be cost-effective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Maybe you can pull extra hot rots from Betty's too, if it works the same, but haven't confirmed that yet. Can definitely confirm this is the case. All of the NPC characters such as the Merchants and even the King himself seem to have their own decks they draw from, with the exceptions of Roxy and Biff as they pull from the base Treasure and Follower pool (likely to prevent that exact "cloned item" scenario from occuring with, say, multiple Bane Blades or Lionheart Breastplates). Merchants allow you to duplicate even "unique" items such as the Lord's Scepter, assuming you get lucky enough to see one offered. The Conjurer follower also appears to have his own Spell Deck he draws from, as he's given me multiple Spell Cards in the past even when there shouldn't be more to draw from in the deck (a third Banish after both have been played, for instance).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see this sort of sentiment bandied around a lot these days (especially with the relatively recent advent of the "brand twitter" phenomenon) and I do get where you're coming from, but with all due respect, isn't all merchandising some form of advertising in its own right? After all, we're all here because of the Funko brand for one reason or another. If you're buying a ton of Disney Pops, that's the iconography and consumerism of the Disney brand. Same for Marvel, DC, video games, etcetera. Either we're all sheep or none of us are.  gt;don't know nor care anything about the thing it's advertising Counterpoint: what about someone that purchases Pops just because they like the way they look? I've never been to Jollibee and couldn't care less about the brand, but you'd better believe I bought one because I thought he was cute.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do a bit of both. For some (most) lines, I'll collect only a few Pops that I like, while some I go for 100%. It comes down to factors of price, rarity, and ultimately how many characters I like out of the overall line. If it's a massive line that has way too many characters and variants I don't care about, I'll usually only pick up the pieces that interest me and move on -- as an example, I bought the Dwight, Jim, and Michael Scott commons from The Office and passed on the rest as I was lukewarm at best on all the others. Mysterio is the only Marvel Pop I own because he's one of my all-time favorite Spider-Man villains. On the other hand I also have a 100% complete set of FNAF (a line of nearly 70 pops) because I liked almost every single Pop in the line. For the very few I didn't (basically just a couple of glow-in-the-dark recolors and a couple of the ones from the recent book series), it felt a bit odd not having them in the collection when it was so close to completion. In general, I find my favorite sets to collect are smaller scale sets that are affordable and manageable to pursue (Zootopia, Persona 5, and Aggretsuko all come to mind). It doesn't always work out: I fell in love with the Otter Pops immediately and knew from day one that all of them would be a must-have, so while I was disappointed that Louie-Bloo ended up being a con exclusive, I bit the bullet and jumped on him because he was the only expensive Pop in an otherwise cheap (and small) line. And though I started out with FNAF when it was just a small series of about six or so commons, I've kept collecting it even after it exploded. While it was fun and I'm very proud of my collection, space and money concerns make it unrealistic to try to do it again with other lines. In summary, the best advice I can give any collector is to just buy what you like. If you like the feel of completing a set but space and cash are concerns, find a very small set of all/mostly commons with characters you like. You'll get the satisfaction of having put that set together but you won't break the bank and you won't need to spend a fortune in shelves and furniture to display them. If you're only into one individual piece from a line, there's nothing wrong with that, either.</TEXT>

All of the normal Adventure Time Pops are vaulted to the best of my knowledge and have been for a while now.

    <TEXT>Part of the reason you're seeing such an influx of these sorts of players is a combination of factors: 1) everyone, not just you, wants to finish their contracts for free stuff which is going to foster an "every mann for himself" mentality 2) Blizzard (and by extension, The Game That Shall Not Be Named) is being boycotted and Fortnite's between seasons 3) TF2 hasn't had a meaningful content update in so long, so there's more incentive for players to come out of the woodwork for it Those points aside, as someone who's been playing since '09, dealing with aggressive players is pretty standard fare for TF2 at Halloween. I'd actually say that from my experience, it's been a little bit tamer this year than it has been in past years. (If you think it's bad now you should've seen the relentless hellscape TF2 was when Mann Manor was first introduced and Halloween gifts would spawn in semi-random locations. They were awarded only to whichever player could reach them first!) Your best bet is to grab a few friends to play with to even the odds, join a Halloween gift farming group (I'm sure the Discord could help you out there), or just be prepared to jump servers every time you run into really obnoxious and aggressive players.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What's the best way to play this character in terms of playstyle and build? Short answer: Don't. Pick literally any other spellcaster over Volodar. Long answer: Volodar's been discussed frequently on the Armello Steam forums and he's come up here a few times as well, and the general consensus seems to be that his ability is far too situational to really be effective. He's got a good stat block for a caster, but his rings are all pretty mediocre (pretty much all of the good spellcasters like Sana, Yordana, Twiss, etc have access to Amethyst, which Volodar *can't* compete with) and he can't even rely on Discipline to bump up his mediocre Fight for half of the game. Sulfur and Sprint/Resist have been my go-to for him, since he's too soft to really risk taking chip damage from Swamps, and I find myself being forced to end early a lot as Volodar instead of press my luck against King's Guards, Banes, other players, etc. I've also had moderate "success" running Cinnabar/Ruin and playing him as a Rot lord, but I think there are other characters that are better at building Rot and can do more with it once they have it. Rot Affinity is a cool idea in theory but in Armello you really want to be flexible rather than pre-locking yourself into a specific victory condition -- "play what the game gives you". I think his ability is his single biggest handicap, because unlike some other genuinely lackluster abilities (Mercurio and Amber both come to mind), ending next to a Bane to enthrall it (especially if you're ending early) doesn't really have the same value as ending early on a settlement as Elyssia or ending early in a forest as Ghor (or a Jade/Taaffeite Bear in general). Enthralled Banes only stay enthralled until they attack someone once, they don't receive any form of buff, and they can even end up being a hindrance to you if you accidentally Enthrall one on top of your Quest, because then you've just got to fight it or waste valuable magic getting rid of it. Yordana is somewhat similar to Volodar in that she's very frail and relies heavily on the Spell deck to get anything done, but even Yordana can rapidly mill the Spell deck with her ability and debuff/hinder her opponents with her pacts -- Volodar doesn't even have that much going for him. Volodar's a super cool character -- he's got some great style points and he's fun in theory, but in practice, he just doesn't have enough going for him compared to other characters in his similar class. Until he gets a buff or the Dragon rings get rebalanced, you're going to have an uphill climb trying to get anything done with him, especially in online multiplayer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Strongly disagree. Scarlet's ability is better than ever with so many players running Ruin now. It's a consistent ability that works every single time when the conditions are met (as opposed to Amber's garbage RNG-reliant ability which only adjusts her odds slightly on Dungeon rolls). If Scarlet focuses on Prestige she can have many opportunities during a game to sway the King's declarations to terrorize settlements, and there are multiple cards like Cub's Blood, Incite Revolt, and Malice Rising (as well as Betty's Bargain Brews to have additional chances to fish up Cub's Blood) that allow her to terrorize settlements manually, if need be. Scarlet gets a lot of flak for her ability but I'd take hers any day of the week over Mercurio's, Volodar's, Amber's, and Barnaby's abilities. Mercurio's hero ability is so minor that I'm forced to wonder if it's not the result of power creep, but rather a stealthy way to balance his excellent stat spread. I struggle to think of very many situations in which getting one extra Gold from another player for taking back a settlement would be much of a game changer. It'd almost be better as a Ring than as an ability, especially on most of the Rats who tend to run Ruby or Turquoise by default in lieu of better Rings. If I were to rebalance his ability, I'd consider having him either steal a random card from the enemy's hand in place of the gold, or have him steal one Gold and one Magic, or swap his hero ability with the effect of one of the other Rat Rings (Cat's Eye, probably). While it's consistent, it's not particularly valuable. I've already ranted about Volodar in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/armello/comments/ejq709/question_regarding_volodar/fd0v4j4/?context=3), but right now I'd say he's tied with Barnaby for the worst ability in the game. Volodar's ability is so niche and impractical. It has an extremely narrow window of usefulness, and it can very easily screw him over by locking a Bane onto a tile he may need to move onto himself. I can think of several different ways I'd change it (have it work like Horace's ability and allow him to swap places with Banes; have it work as a permanent Bane's Claw; convert any Enthralled Bane to a "Dire" Bane in addition to Enthralling them; Enthrall King's Guards as well as Banes; have it function like Yordana's ability by allowing him to 'sacrifice' a Spell card by melting it down in his bell and change it into a Malice Rising; etc) but ultimately it just needs a top-down rework. Right now, Volodar feels like the weakest caster due to an incredibly lackluster ability and a mediocre array of Rings (missing out on Amethyst really hurts him compared to the Bears and Twiss). While I suspect Mercurio's ability is a way to balance his impressive stats, I know for a fact Amber's ability is so mediocre because of her well-rounded stat block and high starting Gold. That said, I think it would be infinitely better if it had even the slightest hint of consistency instead of "slightly better odds to get something nice out of a Dungeon". Even a fix as simple as guaranteeing her not to get Banes from Dungeons during the Day would go really far in making her ability much more reliable, and it would tie better into her Dungeon-heavy playstyle. That said, I'm sure far more experienced players like Mister UPS Man could provide more intelligent and nuanced arguments for an improvement to her lackluster ability. Barnaby's ability is probably my least favorite in the game. With the Item deck being so massive (as well as loaded down with so many consumable cards like Snake Venom that aren't even equipment), Barnaby will draw a ton of junk he doesn't want or can't use while trying to get set up with decent equipment. The problem is that cycling those Item cards out is a real risk given Barnaby's questionable Wits and very low Spirit, forcing him to fight other heroes to discard or risk failing on perils he's not equipped to handle (it's a crap shoot as to whether the peril you're stepping onto hoping to burn useless cards on is a Merry Thieves or a Lightning Strike). I actually think Barnaby's ability would be fine as is, if the Item deck was split into two additional decks: Equipment and Consumables. But because they're all in the same single deck, his ability often tends to be a hindrance more than a help. Once you've got a couple of treasures or a few strong Equipment cards to cycle in and out as the situation calls for it, Barnaby's ability is fantastic (having the Wyld Talisman while Corrupted is a godsend with Barnaby because it lets you switch between Rot Lord and "Clean" as needed!), but it's getting over that hurdle that really hurts him in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Question for the ages. Seems a lot of the 90s nostalgia animation lines have suddenly dried up without warning. *Still* waiting on the rest of the Rescue Rangers to be announced, or Goofy to go with Max... to say nothing of Cartoon Network pops that feel like no-brainers such as Dexter's Lab and Johnny Bravo. Plus, even for ongoing lines, it feels odd that the only SpongeBob pops that keep getting made are Bob, Patrick, and Squidward variants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This. I've seen a thousand red hot takes on Hot Rot Wine being "cheap" but I've never once seen someone say it feels unsatisfying to come up from behind after having a rough game (spawncamping, dealing with teamers, bad dice rolls, drawing dead on cards, etc) and win with HRW when all seemed lost. Armello's a game where anyone has the potential to win on the very last turn, and there are plenty of "cheap" tricks in a game where trickery and backstabbing aren't just a feature, they're encouraged.</TEXT>

Turnaround seems to be a little more than a week from the time you order it to the time it's in your hands, but during really busy times (con seasons, Christmas) it can take a few weeks to get to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fantastic, informative, and timely review. I recently bought a set of 100 soft protectors from RetroProtection and I'm incredibly disappointed with their paper-thin quality -- I've bought tons of soft protectors in the past, usually from eBay, but these are bar none the worst I've bought. Good for keeping dust off of them, I guess, but that's about it. I've had my eye on these Shumi .6 so thanks to your review I definitely think I'll be undertaking the task of switching my collection over!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Kill 3 guards with pardon If you're going to farm this achievement instead of earning it "legit" then the fastest way to get this one done is probably to take a Rabbit with Spinel (amulet choice is optional -- you can take a stat amulet to increase your chances further on Quest rewards, or you can take Discipline/Resist and actually stand a chance in combat) -- and keep restarting Singleplayer games until the Royal Pardon is offered as a potential first-turn Quest reward. Beeline it straight to your first Quest before the AI has a chance to start snowballing, hope that Spinel doesn't screw you over on the risk option, and then once you have the Royal Pardon, use Amber's/Hargrave's high starting gold to put together decent equipment so you can begin bullying the King's Guards. The reason I suggest Hargrave or Amber (besides the fact they're the only clan that has access to Spinel) is because Hargrave is the most solid fighter among the rabbits, and if need be, he can use his ability to trigger a Bounty on himself, luring King's Guards closer (then equip the Pardon once they're within range which can save him some AP having to hunt the guards down). Meanwhile Amber has relatively well-rounded stats so she's got good chances of getting the Royal Pardon (with Spinel) no matter what stat she's tested on, and she's much more effective at casting than Hargrave is so she can dip into the Spell deck for buffs/damage cards to make fighting the King's Guards easier. I don't recommend trying to use Elyssia as she's the least combat-oriented of all the Rabbits, and Barnaby's ability is more of a hindrance than help when you're trying to card cycle to get good combat equipment. From there, it should be a (relatively) simple matter of killing them for the achievement. What I don't suggest: being a moron like I was when I first started ages ago and trying to accomplish this achievement with Sylas, whose ability does *not* proc if he possesses the Royal Pardon. :) (Edited for clarification.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the one I go with for Rides. I know for a fact it's a perfect fit for the Mach 5 as I just ordered one for my own a few weeks ago: https://retroprotection.com/Funko-Rides-2-Pack-Fits-Many-Newer-Taller-Sizes-READ-287.htm I haven't heard of any protectors for OOB pops -- it seems most people going out of box want to have the Pop on display on a shelf or in some kind of display case. I'm sure there has to be something out there, I just haven't heard of it. If you still happen to have the original plastic insert tray from the box, you might try placing the Pop inside then sliding that in a typical "soft" protector. That'd let you see the full figure without the box in the way, but the plastic tray would keep it in place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I usually collect Pops by the set or line, but if I'm forced to choose between one or the other, the deciding factor for me is usually whether the new mold is more accurate to what the character looks like (costume/outfit, etc). For instance, I prefer the older [Squidward](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bTq7SRwjL._AC_SL1000_.jpg) over the [newer one](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61c6SSAK0SL._AC_SX425_.jpg). On the other hand, I have a large collection of the Ad Icons and don't at all feel compelled to pick up the more expensive OG Boo Berry/Count Chocula/Franken Berry because the recently-released ones (with the cereal bowls) are just fine for the purposes of my collection. They're not so drastically different (like a colorways set such as the recent Mickey 90th Pops, or FNAF's Blacklight series) that they're unrecognizable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally, you want to build Wits and Fight as Fang. His low Wits and garbage Spirit mean he has a great deal of trouble with perils. Wits will at least help you with Trickery-based Perils (as well as breaching early, potentially), and besides that, the higher your Wits are, the more variety in symbols you'll have access to burn in combat (which is where Fang excels). I personally prefer Celestite and Discipline for my Fang loadout: Discipline's a great utility amulet that helps both with combat and passing perils at night (Discipline especially gives him a chance against Spirit perils which he struggles against), and the mobility Celestite provides is very difficult to turn down considering that Fang really doesn't want to lose ground to chase enemies or move toward his quests. Rubellite (+3 dice in combat when your health is 3 or lower) is **very** high-risk high-reward, and I tend to play more cautiously so it doesn't suit my style. It puts you in a sweet spot range for a lot of damaging cards, which is usually the easiest way to counter Fang. Feel is tempting if you like the tried-and-true basic stat amulets (I don't, personally), since most of the Rot gain cards (Leech, Plague, etc) tend to sit in the Spell deck. Rot's not necessary at all to win as Fang, though it can make Kingslaying easier if you can gain Rot advantage over the King. The new Ruin amulet combined with Onyx isn't a bad combo either; it helps Fang build Rot reliably at the cost of ensuring he never gets a Trickery bonus (though Fang rarely dips into the Trickery deck anyway) and all but completely shutting out Prestige as a potential win condition. Lack of gold tends to be a huge issue with Ruin since you don't have the ability to hold settlements, which is why you pad that out with Onyx which gives you +2 gold for any creature you kill (including Banes and King's Guards, both easy pickings once you get rolling). Generally speaking, Fang's one of those characters that tends to be immediately focused when he shows up (similar to Elyssia or Yordana), and rightfully so -- he's incredibly powerful if left unchecked. Get used to being Public Enemy #1 if you're going to play him. Equipment's usually an all-or-nothing affair with Fang: to activate your ability you want to do as much damage when attacking as possible, so it's often tempting to front-load pierces (Longbow, Hand Cannons, Silver Lance) or locked-in swords (War Hammer, Heavy Flail). However, Fang's ability does not activate when defending, meaning having no shields leaves you very vulnerable to counterattacks. Items like the Chainmail Shirt, King's Guard Armor and especially the Royal Shield are invaluable to Fang because they can convert misses to shields, and since he tends to be a very dice-heavy character, he will be rolling misses frequently. While misses aren't the end of the world against other players, it can cost you the game versus the King, who greatly benefits from missed dice. I've seen plenty of would-be kingslayer Fangs run in and attack the King, only to throw so many misses against him that they end up doing no damage at all, or worse, heal the King by dying to him instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd love more. I'd like to get the full set of Phantom Thieves, maybe one or two more of the "main" Personas from the game (a 6" Captain Kidd riding his ship or a Rides with Queen on Johanna would be baller but I'm not holding my breath), and I absolutely agree Jack Frost would be a great addition. That said I'd also love to see some of the Persona 4 cast get Pops too especially now that P4G just got re-released -- Teddie at the very least feels like a no-brainer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on player levels relative to theirs (as well as whether they have "find parties" enabled), it's entirely possible they're fully aware and just intimidated. Many new players would rather refuse to ready and take the minute cooldown penalty, then try another lobby, rather than risk going into a game with two or more high level players only to end up getting stomped. Of course, any seasoned player knows that level doesn't necessarily imply skill -- I've played against many low-level players who were quite good at the game, and many 100s that make rookie mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally speaking once they sell out on the site, they're gone for good. There have been a few cases where Funko Shop Exclusives that *don't* sell out end up in stores like GameStop, BoxLunch -- typically flocked/glow variants of Ad Icons. Funko may (and probably will) make variants of Dexter, Johnny, and the Loch Ness (usually a variant like flocked, glow, holding something different, or in a different pose). Keep an eye on this subreddit because leaks and news about new Pops often tend to be leaked here long before they're officially announced.</TEXT>

Plus you can pick one with a good paint job and a good box (if that's something you care about). Otherwise you're at the mercy of a reseller later down the road if you change your mind. The price for him will probably go up when the rest of the commons and exclusives from the wave hit, because completionists will want him for their set.</TEXT>

If this list's accurate it looks like she'll be a common in wave 2 which is good news. Punchy's exciting, too! Can't help but notice two of the Clue suspects are missing (Colonel Mustard and Mrs. Peacock). Presumably those will be along later since two of the six weapons are missing as well. Here's hoping there's some truth to this list of leaks -- some good stuff coming up for sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tanzanite and Watch is a fairly common gimmick combo for the Rats, especially Griotte, to give them a cash engine if settlements are sparse. Griotte relies heavily on being able to play Trickery during the Day so she can be stronger at Night. Watch is also very common on Nazar, who gets a guaranteed Rot symbol in his hand every turn that isn't dependent on his Wits. He can effectively breach the palace at any time, though his "jack of all trades" stat block makes it difficult for him to actually kill the King without a few quests or really solid equipment. If you see this combo, it most likely means he's looking to end the game quickly (or open the door for someone he's in a party with that ordinarily would have a very hard time breaching early, such as Fang). Generally speaking, I find Discipline and Resist to be preferable to Watch. I'd rather have a Shield which is useful in battles *and* perils, or two extra dice in both combat and perils at Day/Night, than one symbol out of the way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hargrave's strength is similar to Elyssia's: area denial. He's a great hero to pick if you want to discourage direct combat with yourself while heading for your quests, and *also* have the added benefit of screwing over the other players who are trying to get to theirs. Emerald and Resist (or Sprint) combined with ending on strategically-selected Plains allows Hargrave to force players into either going around him (and possibly take chip damage from his cannon in the process), or try to fight him when he has three shields baked in before even considering the rest of his equipment. As far as stat building goes, I personally like 1B/1F/2W with Hargrave. The more cards you have in your hand, the more symbols you have to burn in combat. What Hargrave's *not* good for is pretty much anything to do with the Spell deck. Like Mercurio, he's got a very solid stat block for general combat (either killing the King directly or farming prestige by fighting Banes and other players), and like Amber he's got a very respectable starting purse of Gold to work with, but his Spirit is total trash. If you're one of those players that just feels naked without a stat amulet -- and looking at a lot of the equipment recommendations frequently posted to this sub that seems to be an overwhelming majority opinion -- the only stat amulet even worth bothering with on Hargrave is Feel, and that's really only if you want to hit that sweet spot of 3 to play most of the cards in the Spell deck (though as Hargrave, you really shouldn't be drawing spells often until you've already got a solid set of equipment to fight the King with). That said, I never consider it because I'd much, MUCH rather have an extra shield in battles and perils over one more Spirit you can get just from taking a quest (keep in mind, you have a 1/6 chance of rolling a shield on combat dice versus a 3/6 chance of rolling a hit). The important thing to remember about Hargrave is there's nuance to his playstyle. He's built for combat, but it's a specific type of combat that focuses more on dealing indirect damage and pushing other players into bad positions. If that sounds like your cup of tea, there's no better choice in the game, but to succeed with him you need a good idea of gamesense and positioning. Keep an eye on which directions players are headed, or use scouting/the Spy Master to figure out where their quests are, then situate yourself so that you're in their way as much as possible while taking advantage of his good defensive abilities to discourage head-on counterattacking. Just be prepared to be a target for spell cards, which aren't really something he can do much about. Armello, by design, encourages you to play specialist heroes to their strengths rather than trying to turn them into generalists. The game's got a number of all-rounders like Amber and Scarlet if you want to be a jack of all trades. If you want to go all in on direct combat against the King and other players, and killing reliably is your top priority, play as Thane or Fang. If you want to be a spellcaster, take any of the half dozen or so characters designed with casting in mind such as the majority of the Bears, or Twiss/Sargon/Volodar. If you're going to try to run the trickery/prestige long con and stay out of combat in general, you're better off locking down settlements with Elyssia, building a Trickery bonus, and then dumping the full might of the Trickery deck onto whoever's the biggest threat to you at the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on where you bought it from, it's possible someone did a head swap with the other variant because they liked the face better, then packaged it back up and returned it/resold it. Funko boxes aren't sealed, so it's very easy for someone to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adding onto this for OP's benefit -- be wary of anyone online offering preorders for convention exclusive pops. Not only will you most likely play inflated scalper prices, but third party sellers are notorious for canceling preorders (if they think they can get more money elsewhere, or if they're unable to fill your order due to not getting it themselves).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>#I've moved to a new thread! This one's probably outdated by now, so check my profile to see my newest swap thread! Hello everyone. I've been trading on other subreddits for a while now, but this is my first post on r/gameswap. This is probably a long shot, but I'm a Pokemon collector trying to knock out a few of the gaps in my CIB Pokemon game collection. Right now, I'm really only interested in CIB games in good condition to finish my Pokemon set (check below my list of trades for a wishlist of the ones I still need). **9/25 Update** - added *Pokemon Pearl (UAE)* **9/24 Update** - added *Megaman X Command Mission (GCN), PS4 DualShock controller, Nintendo Switch Joy-cons, Megaman Battle Network 3, Paper Mario Origami King + pin set, Super Mario Maker 2, various DS game manuals, Spyro, Spyro Ripto's Rage, Sonic Adventure 2, Final Fantasy Chronicles, Chrono Cross, Megaman Legends 1  amp; 2, Misadventures of Tron Bonne, Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection, Tomb Raider (Saturn), and Popful Mail Magical Fantasy Adventure* # **What I'm trading:** # |Name|System|Condition/Notes|Pics| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Battletoads|Genesis|Case and game only.

Some very minor shelf wear on the longbox case (mostly some light scuffing), but it's intact with no real damage that I can see. Overall this game is in excellent condition, displays very nicely.

    <TEXT>I'd be fine with pricing it at $75. [Pricecharting looks like it's saying $80](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-3ds/persona-q2-new-cinema-labyrinth) which seems to jive with what [I'm seeing on eBay recent solds](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40 amp;_nkw=persona+q2+launch amp;_sacat=0 amp;rt=nc amp;LH_Sold=1 amp;LH_Complete=1). Looks like it's gone as high as $95 and as low as $50, both of which I think are a fluke - seeing quite a few recent solds in the same condition as mine (new but open box) at $85. The only other Persona collectors edition I have at the moment is a sealed Persona 5 Take Your Heart Premium Edition for the PS4.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of all those I think Black 2 is the only one I #8217;m interested in  #8212; I would be interested in Fire Red but I #8217;ve already been offered it by two other people I #8217;m working a deal with. In your previous post you said you had the manual for Colosseum? Were you able to find Colosseum #8217;s manual after all?</TEXT>

I bought this new when it first came out solely to play Persona 4 Golden, and didn't log very much time with this system (maybe about 20 or 30 hours at the most). The screen has had a protector on it to protect from scratches (which I've since removed and discarded to take photos). It's spent most of its life in a soft padded carrying case (included) and hasn't seen any play whatsoever in the last several years. Cosmetically, the system is in excellent condition. I never played the included game at all, and most of the inserts were left in the box (the AR cards are still sealed). **While testing it, the only flaw I noticed is the touchscreen is sometimes too sensitive and sometimes not sensitive enough, but I don't know if that's common with the Vita or not, so I'm offering this one as is.**|[Here](https://imgur.com/a/7mPTVrS)| |Persona 4 Golden|Vita|Complete (game card and case).

It's one of those "budget box" type GBA games like some of the later Megaman Battle Networks that doesn't have the sliding cardboard tray, but rather a cardboard "pocket" internally that holds the cart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For game-to-game trades, I've just been going by Pricecharting and/or recent eBay sales (usually within the last month) to get a sense of value, but since you're notably more experienced here than I am, I'm open to suggestions if there's a different method of pricing games you'd prefer to go by? As for the merchandise: I've got no idea of what to price the Zero 4 tote at -- I can't find anything about it online, so I'm just going to price it at $20 since it isn't sealed but it is in nice shape. $20 for each of the two Megaman plushes seems fair, prices are all over the place with eBay and I'm not seeing any that sold recently that are sealed in bag. So for all three of those items together, I'd value them at $60.</TEXT>

I don't have any of the "video" ones yet since I've been focusing on just the games first. I usually define "complete" as as having the box, manual, tray (if applicable) and game. I'm not too picky if it's missing the more "standard" insert stuff like the safety booklet or the nintendo power ads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They were purchased at Gamestop about a month ago but I decided not to open them when I was able to get my hands on a new Switch. So I'd say it's a safe bet they're the "fixed" ones. Do you know of any easy way to tell?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's all good, so am I. :) So I figure the Ruby at $173 and the Red Rescue Team at $52 ($225 total), based on Pricecharting's listing for them. The joycons, Origami King, and Luigi's Mansion 3 were all recent GS retail pickups I'd planned to use myself (I preordered Origami King in fact) so I'd like to not lose too much cash on them. I'm thinking $110 for both games (and I'll throw in the pins) and $70 for the joycons. I can make the difference up in PayPal, or alternatively if there's something else in my thread you want that I can throw in, that works too. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I certainly don't mind sending pictures of it along if you really think you're interested, but having just checked it, there's some mild wear to the label corner at the top of the cart. It's otherwise in nice shape but if the damage to Megaman  amp; Bass's box was too much for you, I don't see you wanting to swap for this one. And honestly, if I'm going to break up my full set of SNES Megaman games, I would rather save X3 for one of the Pokemon games I don't have yet, instead of upgrading one of the ones I already have. We may just be too far apart and if that's the case, then no hard feelings! I appreciate you trying to work with me.</TEXT>

I bought this new when it first came out solely to play Persona 4 Golden, and didn't log very much time with this system (maybe about 20 or 30 hours at the most). The screen has had a protector on it to protect from scratches (which I've since removed and discarded to take photos). It's spent most of its life in a soft padded carrying case (included) and hasn't seen any play whatsoever in the last several years. Cosmetically, the system is in excellent condition. I never played the included game at all, and most of the inserts were left in the box (the AR cards are still sealed). **While testing the system, I noticed the touchscreen is sometimes too sensitive and sometimes not sensitive enough. I don't know if that's common with the Vita or not, nor do I know if it's an easy fix, so I'm offering this one as is.**|[Here](https://imgur.com/a/7mPTVrS)| |Persona 4 Golden|Vita|Complete (game card and case).

    <TEXT>Ah man, you do have some incredible gems in that list! Unfortunately, I'm not seeing anything that catches my attention since Pokemon and Sonic are basically my "big two" gaming focus. If you come across any CIB Pokemon I need in your travels though, please let me know!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Goodness, I wish I did! Stadium 2's an awesome game. I do suppose my own cart is "spare" in that I'll be replacing it sooner or later for a CIB set. It's not absolutely mint -- there's a little wear on the label (I bought it back in the mid-00s from a used game store) but the cart itself is in nice shape and if you're just looking for one to play then it's perfectly fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, I'm fine with selling/swapping it to someone who just wants it to play -- it's not like my set's complete yet, and since I'm going for a CIB one anyway, this one's almost definitely going sometime. Might as well be now. I can get you some photos shortly. Though that begs the question (since I'm new here) -- since it's a sale rather than a trade (I'm assuming you don't have anything off my wishlist of equal value), uh, how do we do this? Do I need to make a post on r/gamesale for you or can we just do the sale here? :S</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think all offers have to be done in the thread according to the [rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/wiki/faq) and it looks like I'm the one that has to price the item, so -- [Here are pics of it](https://imgur.com/a/E296Yox). I'd be willing to sell for $45 shipped which is $5 lower than Pricecharting's current going rate. (I'll throw in the UGC case below it just to give it some extra protection during shipping.) If that works for you, then let me know and we can move to DMs to exchange payment info and address details. Thanks!</TEXT>

The lowest I'd be willing to sell all three for is **$325 shipped** which is about $31 lower than Pricecharting's current going rates for the set. If that works for you, then just post here confirming you're okay with that price and then we can move to DMs to exchange payment info and address details. If not, no worries either way.

    <TEXT>Oh my god, it absolutely has to be, there's no way it isn't with those names! "Pink Head w/Chase" must be Pops -- could the chase be Anti-Pops? The Regular Show set's one of my all-time favorite lines but the original Rigby mold isn't spectacular. A new series of them is beyond exciting.</TEXT>

I bought this new when it first came out solely to play Persona 4 Golden, and didn't log very much time with this system (maybe about 20 or 30 hours total). The screen has had a protector on it to protect from scratches (which I've since removed and discarded in order to take photos). It's spent most of its life in a soft padded carrying case and hasn't seen any play whatsoever in the last several years. Cosmetically, the system is in excellent condition. I never played the included game at all, and left the inserts in the box (the AR cards are still sealed). A padded carrying case and third-party grip are also included. **While testing the system, the touchscreen is sometimes too sensitive and sometimes not sensitive enough. I don't know if that's common with the Vita or not, nor do I know if it's an easy fix. It plays Persona 4 Golden just fine. I'm offering this system as is.**|[Here](https://imgur.com/a/vWQqwzo)| |Persona 4 Golden|Vita|CIB (game card and case).

    <TEXT>Quite the Megaman collection you have! I used to be huge into Megaman as a kid but I've drifted away from it in recent years. (I have tons of sealed Battle Chips and a bunch of other merchandise and stuff I still need to get around to taking photos of one of these days...) I didn't really see anything that stood out to me tradewise, but if you're interested in anything out of my list, let me know -- I'm totally open to selling. Right now, I'm mostly gunning for the Pokemon games I'm still missing, and the occasional first-party Nintendo titles (N64 and GCN are probably the two Nintendo eras I'm focusing on the most at the second, because I have so few games for them compared to the rest of my collection).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's so cool! My own "first love" of gaming is Sonic, but since I have nearly every Sonic game that I'd want physical copies of, I've moved onto finishing up my Pokemon set. Everything else I pretty much just dabble in these days. I've never used estarland, so I have no idea how I'd go about doing anything through there. I have a wishlist in this thread, I'm mostly just looking for CIB Pokemon that are in good, displayable condition. I suppose push comes to shove, I'd be willing to trade for new/sealed Switch games I don't have, since those are easily enough traded to other collectors here, and my own Switch collection is... meager, honestly. You mentioned you were interested in the Servbot figures -- I should also mention to you that I do have the *very* rare gold Servbot figure from Toron ni Kobun. It's basically the "chase" for the set (they made all 40 numbered Servbots along with the red head parts "favorite" Tron picks at the end of her game, and then a special hidden rare "gold" variant). I'd planned on keeping him for myself (he wasn't cheap), but for the right trade I'd consider parting with him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BBTS is very consistent overall. I've bought both just to test because I was curious about this, and while their "collector grade" for Pops is more than fine for my collection, I imagine that pickier in-box collectors would still consider it unacceptable -- I noticed a few minor imperfections like creases/corner dings, and one pop had a couple of (minor) dents in the plastic window. However, the paint jobs were very good with no noticeable or glaring flaws, which in my opinion is more important than a mint box. Overall, I've ordered plenty of Standard grade toys from them and haven't noticed any real differences between what they consider "standard" and "collector" grade as far as packaging goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have two sealed switches - bought a normal one (red/blue) about a month ago from GameStop for a friend #8217;s birthday so she could play Animal Crossing with me. Then the ACNH ones restocked so I plan on giving her that one instead since her birthday is on the 29th.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You may not be interested but I do have a red Game Boy Pocket, however, it is missing the sticker on the back of the unit (it was like that when I bought it years ago). It's in otherwise very nice condition with some very, very faint scratches on the screen. I can try to get you better photos, but [here are just a couple quick ones I took](https://imgur.com/a/x882bzO) on the off chance you're interested.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only things that stood out on your list as something I'd be interested in are your copies of Metroid Prime and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle if they're black label (not "player's choice") and in good shape. Do you have photos of them? I guess I might be interested in some of the Pokemon cards as well, if you have ones that are in nice, non-creased/damaged/played condition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as stuff Funko does? By far and away, incomplete lines or lines that get canceled midway through with no indication from Funko that they're done with that license; it's been two years since Monterey Jack released and I'm still waiting for the rest of the Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers pop line. As far as general collecting with pops, store exclusives are another annoyance, especially when forced to buy them online -- I'm not fond of the concept of exclusives to begin with, but I certainly don't like it when I buy a store exclusive from Amazon or Hot Topic and they ship it in a mylar bag or a box with no packing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm definitely more interested in the rarer cards higher up that list. Let me know how many of those you'd be willing to add on top of Metroid Prime. Also, I know this goes without saying, but the copy of Pokemon Red with the Game Boy Pocket was just to demonstrate it was working (and because I kept it in there to keep dust out of the cartridge slot).</TEXT>

I bought this new when it first came out solely to play Persona 4 Golden, and didn't log very much time with this system (maybe about 20 or 30 hours total). The screen has had a protector on it to protect from scratches (which I've since removed and discarded in order to take photos). It's spent most of its life in a soft padded carrying case and hasn't seen any play whatsoever in the last several years. Cosmetically, the system is in excellent condition. I never played the included game at all, and left the inserts in the box (the AR cards are still sealed). A padded carrying case and third-party grip are also included. **While testing the system, the touchscreen is sometimes too sensitive and sometimes not sensitive enough. I don't know if that's common with the Vita or not, nor do I know if it's an easy fix. It plays Persona 4 Golden just fine. I'm offering this system as is.**|[Here](https://imgur.com/a/vWQqwzo)| |Persona 4 Golden|Vita|CIB (game card and case).
