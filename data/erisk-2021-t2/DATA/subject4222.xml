    <TEXT>I really really love this camera but it is very slow when it comes to focus. The focus on my 8 year older Canon APS-C was much faster than this. But I'm doing lots of concert photography with fast moving people and I keep getting great shots! But sure I miss some as they're out of focus. For the price tag it's incredible especially in low light. I didn't have money for a A7III so this one was perfect for me. Don't know if I'd be as happy as I am with an alpha 6500 (much better focussing). Long story short: Yes, it totally makes sense for me to buy an a7II in 2020! But if I would be making money with my photos the 1k extra for a younger model are totally worth it for a faster focussing system.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Which multi function Printer/Scanner?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-17 10:36:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I need to buy a new printer and want to buy a multifunction printer again. Are there specific models which are better for scanning negatives? Or should I get a separate scanner with a special tray for scanning my photos? I don't need a fancy printer as I don't use it often so it'd be very cool if the price isn't too high. The only feature I'd like to have is wifi. Just thought I ask the experts here before buying the cheapest model I can get  #128517;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Distance! :D Between the object and the window in the back are approx. 4m (13ft) distance and I was pretty close around 40cm (1-2ft) to the courage. As it was shot inside the f-stop was about f8 (can't tell for sure because of the special apperture in the sx-70). So it's just natural bokeh because I'm close to the object and the background is in relation pretty far away.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Posting crappy photo resolutions for one year from my A7II</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-19 14:56:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So about a year ago I bought my A7II. I always shoot raw only and since I got this camera I was wondering why the resolution and the quality was so low when transfering photos via wifi. On vacation I was always transfering pictures to post them on Instagram and so on. I tried to google it but haven't found a solution so I came to the conclusion that this must be a stupid software restriction. One week ago I stumbled upon a comment with a similar problem only to find out, that I was always transfering the jpg preview embedded in the raw file all the time! Switching from raw only to raw+jpg fixed everything! I feel stupid for not knowing this for one year  #128516;Happy that this "problem" is solved now but I hate that I have to get all the JPG files just to be able to pull the full resolution of my image.  #8203; ps: I know the app cascable but for me it's not performing too well...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But setting it to "original" won't transfer full res in my case. If I have it set to raw only I'll get 2MP photos. And yes, I do have an SD Card Reader but the cable is a little bit broken. But I really like the workflow with the Sony App.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an exception. I don't really know why it worked so good this time. Usually I have the same Problems as you do. I guess it's the combination of light and apperture and that there's so much sky in the picture. The SX-70 has its special apperture so maybe it's just good luck with combination of the setting. In my other pictures the sky gets always washed out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So actually it's a Rolleicord III manufactured between 1950 and 1953. I got it from eBay for 60 #8364; (approx 67$). A friend of mine sold his about ten years ago and I was thinking too long and it was gone before I made a decision. It think it's a good price for it. The long times don't work but everything shorter than 1/2 second seems to work. Before buying I searched for pictures on Reddit and was amazed by the sharpness of the lens! It features the same lens as its successors: Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1:3.5 75mm. Really happy to finally own it!</TEXT>

Doesn't have to be a fisheye but something with a really wide angle for nature photography. Happy for any tips!

It's a powerful tool for removing anything from a picture. The second feature I used was the simple clone stamp. Haven't used photoshop in a while but take a look at the "content aware fill". There should be dozens of tutorials on YouTube. The clone stamp should be the same in photoshop as it's in Affinity Photo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I made my first try with DSLR scanning but I #8217;m having issues with the development. I watched several YouTube Videos but I keep having too much blue and I can #8217;t really handle the orange mask. First tried it with Capture One but I only have the free Sony Version, not Pro. This is my best try with Affinity Photo. The question I #8217;m having is if my main issue is with the scan or my editing process. Can anybody sort this out for me so I know in which direction I have to go?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My father is a dental technician and he got this camera from his father when he had to document his work for his apprenticeship. It's basically a Zeiss Ikon SL-706 with the same functions. He just used it for dental photos with the tamron macro. The standard kit lens is a Voigtl #228;nder Color-Ultron 50mm/1.8 and is mint condition as it was almost never used. In several boards you can read that the Color-Ultron is the same as the Zeiss Planar 50mm 1.8. The camera has a built in light meter but I'm still waiting for the battery to test it out. I loaded the first film yesterday. Can't wait to see the results. It's not the most beautiful camera and quite heavy, but it's definitely a solid camera with most features you need. This version has an m42 mount so it's easy to find more lenses. And I'll use the macro on the left to scan my negatives. Win-win! :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What speaks against the Orange Micro Dark?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-19 10:25:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know too much about amps so far but as I'm starting a new band project I'm thinking about getting some nice gear. This is all a hobby so I want to keep my budget low. The Micro Dark looks incredible for its price. The FX loop is a nice add-on. Just wanted to know if there's something I'm missing? What speaks against it? I'm not going to have many gigs. It should be perfect for band practice and smaller shows. One alternative I've been thinking about is the VOX MV50 series (AC or clean). It has no FX loop but I've read that it's better to get the clean version to get the best out of my effect pedals. And it's 50W compared to the 20W of the orange.</TEXT>

But I Made a mistake with the design and the hinges and the ones I had didn't work as the board plate is blocked by the back (difficult to describe). I need to find some hinges like those in kitchen cabinets to fix it. And the magnets are way too strong :D need to put something between magnet and metal otherwise I'll rip off the the tab.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Here's](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Guitar-Pedalboard/) one of the boards which served as an inspiration. That's from where I got the idea with the magnets and hinges. It's way more professional. But those are the type of hinges I'll need.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need help identifying Fender Telecaster (or parts caster?)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-21 13:00:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm searching for a new Telecaster and found a Fender for a pretty good price (about 350$) which somehow seems almost to low in my opinion so I wanted to ask if someone can help me identify it. I have a feeling that it's not a Fender at all but a parts caster with fender headstock. It has no serial number and the headstock says "made in America". Shouldn't it have a serial number? Shouldn't the tuners have a fender logo? The offer is not in my home town and pretty far away so I can't go there and check by myself. If it's a real fender I could send a friend to get it for me that's why I'm asking. Any help is really appreciated. Here are some pictures from the listing: [https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109701505\_1397604473783751\_758650475144768289\_o.jpg?\_nc\_cat=106 amp;\_nc\_sid=843cd7 amp;\_nc\_ohc=aQ77EQafPasAX9KfRsJ amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;\_nc\_tp=6 amp;oh=5177dcb1cee955887f2a94aa3224f5e2 amp;oe=5F3BF73C](https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109701505_1397604473783751_758650475144768289_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106 amp;_nc_sid=843cd7 amp;_nc_ohc=aQ77EQafPasAX9KfRsJ amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;_nc_tp=6 amp;oh=5177dcb1cee955887f2a94aa3224f5e2 amp;oe=5F3BF73C) [https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109666833\_1397604360450429\_7756983420093204123\_o.jpg?\_nc\_cat=111 amp;\_nc\_sid=843cd7 amp;\_nc\_ohc=opYYMNy\_BaYAX9Glwph amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;\_nc\_tp=6 amp;oh=424cfb4745fc887eca8201f57e8a0ebc amp;oe=5F3DB693](https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109666833_1397604360450429_7756983420093204123_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111 amp;_nc_sid=843cd7 amp;_nc_ohc=opYYMNy_BaYAX9Glwph amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;_nc_tp=6 amp;oh=424cfb4745fc887eca8201f57e8a0ebc amp;oe=5F3DB693) [https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109684371\_1397604340450431\_260010148733704299\_o.jpg?\_nc\_cat=104 amp;\_nc\_sid=843cd7 amp;\_nc\_ohc=FUIPxrw9vpwAX\_T1yNq amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;\_nc\_tp=6 amp;oh=b2f44ccb577485d4bc695713d1432caf amp;oe=5F3BE15E](https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109684371_1397604340450431_260010148733704299_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104 amp;_nc_sid=843cd7 amp;_nc_ohc=FUIPxrw9vpwAX_T1yNq amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;_nc_tp=6 amp;oh=b2f44ccb577485d4bc695713d1432caf amp;oe=5F3BE15E) [https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109729005\_1397604287117103\_4771033375610421084\_o.jpg?\_nc\_cat=102 amp;\_nc\_sid=843cd7 amp;\_nc\_ohc=JMn-R9NHQAIAX\_pg08V amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;\_nc\_tp=6 amp;oh=897d02c84a25b8088124b70359771aa6 amp;oe=5F3C9AF4](https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/109729005_1397604287117103_4771033375610421084_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102 amp;_nc_sid=843cd7 amp;_nc_ohc=JMn-R9NHQAIAX_pg08V amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx amp;_nc_tp=6 amp;oh=897d02c84a25b8088124b70359771aa6 amp;oe=5F3C9AF4)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A good friend of mine has a YouTube Channel and a Podcast and has always a lot of  #8222;crazy #8220; sounds. So I made a sound fx board for him. Mainly used parts I had at home and only ordered the keypad. This is the first time I made something myself without a guide or tutorial. Used a Nano in combination with a DFPlayer Mini to play the mp3 files. First I went with AAA Batteries but switched to a 9V Block instead. At the end I added a status LED to the top to indicate if the sound module was initialized properly. It was hard to fit it into the case. Pretty happy with the result and so was he when I gave it to him! Crappy gut shot: [https://imgur.com/a/BEPovSn](https://imgur.com/a/BEPovSn)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting That you had problems the other way around! With the AAA batteries sometimes the Arduino turned on but the dfplayer wouldn't. Not sure if it wasn't enough power or just the holder. And yes, I've used the Library. Just a simple switch case with the different buttons and use the library to stop Playback and play the specific sound. I'll definitely take a look at dyplayer as I would loved to do it without an SD card. The sounds are only a few KB so an SD card is way too big.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>White background removal. How does it work?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-08 14:06:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel really stupid but I'm using Affinity Photo for over 4 years now and the white background removal has never worked for me in any way. Have a graphic with simple white background and the only thing what happens is that the image gets rasterized. Is there a special trick to do it? I'm talking about really simple stuff like this here. https://preview.redd.it/nk6clkk3lxl51.png?width=296 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=27c7d34cd5fd44d1e7d9ec00cedc5e6026a7cba6</TEXT>

My document is transparent, my layer ist rasterised. I click the filter and nothing visible happens. Even if I use the wand tool and use the filter afterwards nothing happens. The [doc](https://affinity.help/photo/en-US.lproj/index.html?page=pages/Filters/filter_removeWhiteMatte.html?title=Remove%20White%20Matte) isn't helping me either. I was hoping this would be an easy way to remove the white background (as the german translation really is "remove white background" and not "matte") but I guess I'll have to stick with "refine selection" or color selection.</TEXT>

It's a Konica Pop and a Polaroid EE60. The Konica is a pretty camera but very limited (one shutter speed) but I'll shoot some rolls. I don't expect great results. The Polaroid takes peel apart film. I'll try out the new ONE INSTANT film. But first I'll have to see if I can save this camera as the batteries drained inside. Looking forward to try both of them out!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes they are great! Love them and the show was amazing. I pushed to 1600. I heard an episode of the podcast "analog talk" with Casey Lee as a guest. He shoots concert on film and gave a few tips. I find delta 1600 too grainy so I used HP5. I shot Silverstein a month later and used Agfa APX pushed to 800 but it's very grainy. Will stick to HP5 in the future! I kept my aperture all the time at 1.8 to compensate the lighting situation. Luckily the lighting was very good for a hardcore show. I'm photographing shows for a while now so I have a few people who I can ask for a photo pass without them expecting great pictures in return. But when I started shooting live I just emailed the booking agency who is organizing the tour and asked friendly. Most of the time they are in charge who gets a photo permission. Hardcore shows are really tough to focus as everyone is moving so fast. And often someone bumps into you in the audience when there's no barrier. But they have the greatest poses for photos! :D edit: btw I saw your great pinhole camera video and the accent sounded a little bit german. If I'm right, I can also answer any more detailed questions in german ;) greetings from cologne.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It also depends on your budget. The Canon AE-1 is a popular camera for beginners. Check YouTube for some Videos about it. There's a good video from grainy days. I'm assuming you're not looking for a automatic point and shoot which does all the settings for you. If you do, check the Olympus MJU-I. There are also many videos on YouTube which explain what to check for your first analog camera. One thing you have to keep in mind is that the lenses are often more important than the camera itself.</TEXT>
