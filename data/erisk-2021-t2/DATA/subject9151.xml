    <TITLE>Thinking about visiting Kazakhstan.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-25 08:43:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I was thinking lately about visiting Kazakhstan as a tourist and would like to ask somd things. What are cool things that I can see in Kazakhstan and what is the main attractions there? I dont understand the Kazakh language or Russian although I speak English fluently, will this be a problem? I am an Arab, and a Palestinian, the news about the lynching of some Arab workers for the doings of one person is a bit worrisome. Will I get in trouble If I say that I am a Palestinian or an Arab? And how do pepole think about us in general? How expensive is Kazakhstan compared to Azerbaijan or Turkey for example? Thank everyone who answers : D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hello guys, can I ever take diving as a hobby?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-26 17:24:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Since the time I was 10 I wanted to take diving as a hobby when I grow up. My dad and mom never learned how to swim and so I have never had the opportunity to dive as a kid and always swam in the pool trying to imagine how is it to be a diver. 8 years ago, a stupid kid (fuck him) jumped into the pool I was swimming into (despite this being against the rule but the man responsible probably were asleep). the kid jumped a karate jump and he hit me directly on the right ear with his foot, this caused my ear to have a lot of pressure and pop. ever since this bad experience my ear hurts like a bitch when I go down in a flight or on a fast road and I feel unbalanced pressure. Can I ever dive? I know that the answer is most likely no I am going to the doctor this week but I really want to achieve that childhood dream of mine someday and I wanted to ask if somebody was in a similar situation and can give me hope. thank you all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what no two rational beings can argue about is the fact that a rescission is coming. we can't know when but it is coming and probably in the next 5 years. MO is a now a cheap sin stock that moons up in recessions (see 2008) and gives a 8.3 dividend until then, solid cash flow, debt is not a problem good management and 52 years of raising the dividend. also great fundamentals all around. with people literally addicted to the main product. why shouldn't I just dump all of my holdings and buy MO stocks with my life saving ? Until the recession I will get the div even if it drops and when the recession hits I sell. This way I am not affected by the decrease in smoking and shit that will happen 10- 20 years from now and also making gains.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-11 07:10:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>after seeing hundreds of comments cursing the fuck of our country and people and some saying they just despise Palestinians, I really feel like explaining something. Dear people of Turkey, the Palestinian government with its head Mahmoud Abbas are "NOT" representative of the people. For the people of Palestine have nothing but wishes of peace and safety for the Turkish republic, we understand how hard it is to have 5 million refugees, and we also understand how hard it is to be hated by the world for defending your country. Mahmoud Abbas is a puppet not fit to rule a farm let alone a country under occupation. his condemnation is comming directly from his masters in you know where. I also saw often that the comments about hating Palestinians were also full of love for a certain group of people who trained the pkk and sdf and supplied them with weapons that might kill Turkish soldiers, yeah this is stupid... we want peace between all (even between us and the Israelis, if we can get to a solution) have no quarles with Turkey or its people on tge contrary I Believe we are the one of the few arab states who really like Turkey. we only wish for safety for all the people involved, turks, Kurds, Syrians.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-05 09:32:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey fellow saudis, palstinein here. I had a thought and maybe you will like it. Saudi Arabia and iran are two very powerful neighboring countries with vast oil reserves, despite the many shared costumes and religion the two countries have been at the throat of each other for the past 5 decades or so. If a peace is signed this will greatly improve the region and benefit the two nations greatly. other than that those are some other reasons: 1- when the Iranian public see that no other country in the world is sending medical supplies to help them they will start to question their government rhetoric. 2- the Iranian people are innocent, they are brainwashed by the government, they aren't the enemy, and it is only humane to help them. 3- this will greatly help the international image of saudi arabia 4- gaining the love of the Iranian citizens will increase the soft power saudi have in the region (currently you have non) 5- pretty sure their government is currently blaming the saudis for the shortages of medical supplies and the ban on Iran. 6- being kind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That is not killing anyone, you're exaggerating. You're talking about cuts in crop yields. use some logic, if crop yields drop then people are going to starve, for 3 years water of the nile will be filling the Ethiopian dam meanwhile the majority of Egyptians (which is a country dependent on agriculture exports) will suffer food insecurity and loss of income because less water is getting to them. the above image is a good source to see the watef and economic loss  gt;Ethiopia is filling the dam during the rainy/flood seasons. That flood water would have over-flowed in so many places in Sudan anyways. They're doing it in phases and they'll adjust based on the impact. correct me but doesn't Ethiopia want the dam filled in three years? how will they do that in only the rainy season? sources please I would love to read about this.  gt;They're not filling the dam to the top at once. source?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>how was sudan share of the nile affected? thd people close to the dam were in facg compensated and moved by the Egyptian government so yes we cared about them quoting from wikipedia In Sudan, 50,000 to 70,000 Sudanese #160;Nubianswere moved from the old town of #160;Wadi Halfaand its surrounding villages. Some were moved to a newly created settlement on the shore of Lake Nasser called New Wadi Halfa, and some were resettled approximately 700 kilometres south to the semi-arid Butana plain near the town of Khashm el-Girba up the #160;Atbara River. The climate there had a regular rainy season as opposed to their previous desert habitat in which virtually no rain fell. The government developed an irrigation project, called the #160;New Halfa Agricultural Development Scheme #160;to grow cotton, grains, sugar cane and other crops. The Nubians were resettled in twenty five planned villages that included schools, medical facilities, and other services, including piped water and some electrification. In Egypt, the majority of the 50,000 Nubians were moved three to ten kilometers from the Nile near #160;Kom Ombo, 45 kilometers downstream from Aswan in what was called "New Nubia". Housing and facilities were built for 47 village units whose relationship to each other approximated that in Old Nubia. Irrigated land was provided to grow mainly sugar cane.[28][29] In 2019 #8211;20, Egypt started to compensate the Nubians who lost their homes following the dam impoundment.[30] if the Ethiopian government is ready to compensate 50~ million rural people for the loss of income and provide them with food security by all means build the dam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Is it fair for Ethiopia to continue dealing with the same issue but not Egypt? I agree with you that what is happening in Ethiopia isn't fair and believe me when I say that I would love to see a stronger wealthier more united africa, but ask yourself this question, if you are driving a train and saw 5 men working on the track, you quickly realise that you are going to run them over and kill all of them if you don't change tracks, so you start changing tracks but notice other 5 people on the other track, is it right and fair for you to kill the other five in order to save the original five? I want to see a richer Ethiopia, I hear a lot about the food and culture and generosity of Ethiopians, we learn about your hospitality first thing in school and about how you welcomed the first muslims as guests. I want peace, but not when it kills my family. Ethiopia should come back to the negotiations table and reach an agreement to filing the dam, the problem is Ethiopia sadly made a deal with the devil and took Chinese (who are by the way very racist toward black people and I don't know why African countries keep taking the bite) loans and this is what is pressuring you guys to want to do this quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>jordan is the country I am living in so I will talk about it  gt;3. My girlfriend is vegan and I read in another thread, that you barely find vegan meals in restaurants etc, is it really that hard and which country has the most vegan friendly kitchen? the levant or Egypt are big on traditional vegetarian dishes, most dishes can replace meat if you like. but my advice is go to jordan at first, egypt is, a little more intense?  gt;4. There were also mentions of germans or the whole west being too perverted, so long clothing would be advisable? in Jordan at least westerners aren't a very rare sight and the culture itself is a blind between west and east, you can wear minimally revealing western clothes in Jordan but stick to the affluent places of amman and the touristic historical sites.  gt;1. What are some no-gos to say or to do (a foreigner might not know), which are regarded as rude or disrespectful? just have some common sense, most people are friendly  gt;2. What are some things about your specific country I'd have to visit? Petra, amman itself and the citdel, the dead sea (lowest point on earth) jerash (a nearly perfectly preserved roman city) and aqaba, the red sea. if you can do it try going next door to egypt sharm el sheikh/dahab for some of the best diving experiences in the whole world. um qies is unknown to tourists but it is amazing too, you can see the whole sea of galilee (where jesus walked on water) in roman texts the wine made in arabella (irbid) and jerash was the best wine in the ancinet world, sadly no wine making industry survived but the olive oil industry that replaced it is very good, I would argue that the olive oil in jerash is the best in the world, a tie with my native Palestinian olive oil : P also always hire a highly rated local guide</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in a way yes, the way of slaughtering halal is supposed to be the most merciful way and the less the animal feels pain is better, this is why we are instructed to get the sharpest knife, sharpen it, not slaughter an animal in fromt of another and most importantly to raise animals humanly. the problem with the muslim world isn't mainly about religion, it is wahhabism and salfisim fixation on using only the old ways, mean while in the quran and sunnah only wine is prohibited because it is alcoholic, but the sheikhs concluded that whiskey, beer, and other more modren alcoholic beverages are prohibited too by using logic. then why I wonder if halal slaughtering is supposed to be the most merciful way and today we have the technology to stun and not kill an animal before slaughtering it, is this not used and advocated by religious scholars as a new way to slaughter halal. meanwhile the industrial halal complex is breaking many msny rules opting for a recorded disk saying bismallh as if the bismallh is more important than the humane slaughter and treatment of animals. tales of prophet mohamed talking to abused animals and instructing muslim owners to take good care of them are widespread</TEXT>

(Also english captions) https://youtu.be/23ruEfLScnM 3) A modern take on an ancient love poem rumored to be written by the ummayd caliph yazed. I think you will love this. (subtitles are their too) https://youtu.be/nXoJDHUC63I 4) An Egyptian rap song talking about current problems with society, this is by far the best Egyptian rapper in my opinion, this songs will show you how much fusion between the signing styles in the east and the west combine (also read the subtitles and watch the video it is a masterpiece that in my opinion successfully presents the current reality in egypt) (Egyptians tell me if this right) https://youtu.be/DjLpLaGPANM (the song ends at 4:00 but the video clip continues a little bit more) 5) the arab world answer to prohibition of alchohol was to get drunk in music and so tarab music was born: I) melhem barakat (one of the best) https://youtu.be/oRKzou9bw0g II) sabah fakhery https://youtu.be/vGB-Vj3oi78 (good)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't believe that all royalty are bad, I stated above that I support the Jordanian monarchy for example.  gt;the US support is dwindling because itself is under siege by this is plausible but take what happened in Egypt in 2011 for example, the revolution deposed the dictator that ran the country for the last 40 years, but the new elected president president couldn't do anything since only the old dictator has gone but not the rest of the wealthy courrpt people, when Mohammed Morsi tried giving himself more power in order to bypass the old oligarchy the media (givin free speech in morsi year) and that is owned by the oligarchy started painting him as wanting to become a dictator and turn egypt into a caliphate (didn't help him that he was part of the muslim brotherhood), the people started protesting again fearing a death to the revolution then a new "hero" appeared, sisi, the head of the army deposed Mohamed morsi, took power in a fake election proceeded to free the old dictator (as laughable as it sounds) and imprisoned the elected president (he died in prison by the way). not only this, hd also did what the people accused morsi of, and gavd himself more power, and stated that he wkll stay in power until 2030 instead of 4 year term. yet many people still support him, because the media is with him, the oligarchy supports him because he makes them richer. also all this happened with the support of the United states and Europe. take a look at this video https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs  gt;Maybe another question, I have heard that the Arab elite use Europe as some sort of workbench or as the people that draw the blueprints.

    <TEXT>I personally eat meat and see nothing wrong with it if done humanely but I do agree that the most optimal solution is if I get meat but animals don't die and by this I mean cultured meat in the lab. I am curious to see what the Muslim world will think about this new invention if it goes mainstream  gt;But it is interesting that meat eating is very common in the arab world, when technically, it seems counter intuitive if being 'kind to animals' is a something you should follow. the thing is meat eating wasn't common until the 1950 when factory farming brought down thw price of meat so the poor could afford it, the people associated meat with wealth and status and so prefer to eat it when they can.  gt;Though I think all vegans will forever be grateful to arabs for hummus and falafel. many arab dishes are vegan, try mujdara, arabic salads (we have a big tradition) taboulah manaqesh knafeh (if eatening chesse is ok)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I doubt this is talked about much in the Arab world, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a steady stream of drug tourism from the Middle East to Latin America. Looser laws, cheaper prices, and you're so far from home that there's little chance of anyone who knows you seeing you there. I cannot comment on this because I don't know much about the whole situation but I see that your assumptions are logical.  gt;Does the popularity of dubbed Mexican telenov #233;las contribute to this? Those are huuuuuge in a lot of the world, including some places quite far from Mexico. I remember some time bsck that Mexican dubbed series were famous here for a while but they were quickly replaced by turkish and south Korean tv shows. I think thaf people here view Mexico as a country where you can go to an adventure and with a population that is somewhat close to our culture (or at least this is how we perceive them)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So what? Many photos exist in the article and every Palestinian city or village had it's own design. furthermore the city shifted to be majority Christian because the zoinsts ethically cleansed many Palestinian villages and many people sought refuge in ramallh and beit lahm, today all Palestinians Christians or muslims are equal in each other eyes and in the eye of the occupation. Also Ramallh mayor is a Christian, and many high ranking officials in the PA are Christian too. co existence and the feeling we are one people was always their in Palestine between muslims and Christians (despite what happened in Damascus and in Lebanon), and we shared culture, dress, food and language and felt kinship with many inter religious marriages happening, even today</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"While it is difficult to enumerate the war's casualties, the FLN estimated in 1964 that nearly eight years of revolution effected 1.5 #160;million deaths from war-related causes. Some other French and Algerian sources later put the figure at approximately 960,000 dead, while French officials estimated it at 350,000, however they were accused of dishonesty regarding their estimation, the Algerian sources are likely to be more accurate. French military authorities listed their losses at nearly 25,600 dead (6,000 from non-combat-related causes) and 65,000 wounded. European-descended civilian casualties exceeded 10,000 (including 3,000 dead) in 42,000 recorded violent incidents. According to French official figures during the war, the army, security forces and militias killed 141,000 presumed rebel combatants.[14]:538 #160;But it is still unclear whether this includes some civilians." this is from the wikipedia page. let us not talk about the other war crimes the French did in Algeria. I shared an unknown sad event that directly connect to the post. I think it is relevant that the truth about colonization be told, specially when it is so recent and is kept hidden by the french and European governments. we learn the past so that it is not repeated. nice poster by the way, thank you for sharing history, I meant no offense to you personally so don't take it this way</TEXT>

Initially, there was great resistance. After an ordeal had justified the king's demand and confirmed the truth of the Jewish faith, many Himyarites supported Judaism. Some historians argue that the people were not motivated by politics, but that Judaism, by its philosophical, simplistic, and austere nature, was attractive to the nature of the Semitic people." P.

Despite the poverty.  gt;We make nothing in Jordan we have literally no ideas of our own or add any value to the world at large Because our smart people all go to the west, again because of poverty and low wages. we have the best medical students/doctors in the middle east, and despite the brain drain we still have flourishing medical tourism. also we are becoming a major textile producer in yhe region There is bad but also good in Jordan, and despite me believing in the freedom of others you can't ignore that the country culture bar "west amman" doesn't allow things like that. they aren't "cave dwelling inbreds" because they thjnk differently than you</TEXT>

The person before me stated correctly that Lebanon has been violating the Palestinians human rights, mosy importantly not giving them access to the Lebanese healthcare system. the Palestinians in Lebanon are all northern Palestinians, they share the same dilect, the same culture, the same history. they are only Palestinians and not Lebanese because sykes-picot drew the line a little bit to the north. (using a pencil and a ruler mind you) but more importantly not many "Palestinians" exist in thd camps today, 76 years after Israel displaced the Palestinians not many of them are left, most people in thd camps were born in Lebanon, denied basic opportunities available less then 30 miles away/ forced to work illegally in dangerous conditions and underpaid just because of who their great grand parents were. if this is not injustice to you I am not interested to hear more</TEXT>

It's as mythical as the story of native American princess in US families. this is true of the families who were here before the ottomans mainly because the ummayds were big on arabaztion and the fact that in early Islam in order to convert to the religion as a non arab it was required that an arab tribe adopts you as a mawla. families that came more recently during the ottoman control of the region can trace their ethnicty easier, the shihab dynasty was a muslim arab tribe that had members of the family convert to Christianity with no problem and it is all documented (family still split between Christians and muslims) so it won't be other worldly that harb Christians descend from the biggest arab tribe that immigrated to the region (But it is all speculation I can't prove anything so it is best if we leave the debate unfinshed)</TEXT>

Those same refugees have been suffering in camps, stricken by poverty and disease, discriminated against. People whose entire life was in camps, lost the opportunity to get a basic high school education, can't work legally in most countries, forced to be dependent on donations and unrwa. those people can't get over it, and so do Palestinians.

    <TEXT>maybe but what I am saying isn't a theory it is verified officially The Israeli government funded Hamas in the early 1980s as part of a "divide and rule" strategy: to sow division among the Palestinian population by fueling the fringe Islamists and thus to forestall the ascendancy of Fatah and communist parties. In the early 1980s, #160;Brigadier General #160;Yitzhak Segev #160;was the Israeli military governor of Gaza, who explained that  #8220;The Israeli government gave me a budget, #8221; some of which was given "to the mosques". "Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel #8217;s creation, #8221; according to #160;Avner Cohen, Israeli religious affairs official who served for over 20 years in Gaza, who said he wrote an official report warning his government superiors against backing Palestinian Islamists against secularists.[114][115]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Palestinian official anathem "fidai" (the real Palestinian anathem is mawtni) is translated to "warrior" People translate fida"i to warrior because of the connection of the word fidai with the early Palestinian resistance called "fdaien", this translation is however wrong. fda"i means " I am ready to sacrifice my self for" (would be happy for any help in the translation) Any Arabic reader will get to my conclusion if they listen to the words take the two first passages for example :  #1601; #1583; #1575; #1574; #1610;  #1601; #1583; #1575; #1574; #1610;  #1601; #1583; #1575; #1574; #1610;  #1610; #1575;  #1575; #1585; #1590; #1610; #1548;  #1610; #1575;  #1575; #1585; #1590;  #1575; #1604; #1580; #1583; #1608; #1583;  #1601; #1583; #1575; #1574; #1610;  #1601; #1583; #1575; #1574; #1610;  #1601; #1583; #1575; #1574; #1610;  #1610; #1575;  #1588; #1593; #1576; #1610;  #1610; #1575;  #1588; #1593; #1576;  #1575; #1604; #1582; #1604; #1608; #1583; It doesn't make since to translate this to : "warrior warrior warrior. my land, my ancestral land. warrior warrior warrior. my nation, my immortal nation." yet this is how it is translated every where on the internet from wikipedia to youtube a more correct translation will be : "I am ready to sacrifice my self for you (x3). my land, my ancestral land. I am ready to sacrifice my self for you (x3) my nation, my immortal nation" Do you agree with me? am I making sense?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hamas was funded by Israel to create division in the Palestinian leadership, as said by a former head of the mossad. Furthermore not all Palestinians like hamas (majority don't support them because of their corruption). The PA is the accepted government of the Palestinians (also not very supported because it gave too many concessions to Israel in order to make peace but Israel continued fucking over the PA) Add to this that all the peace offers that Israel forwarded were not in good faith and wanted the Palestinians to forfeit the right of return for all Palestinian refugees that were displaced by Israel. Palestinians can offer Israel an unequal peace treaty tommorw that say peace in exchange of all land that is 10 kilometers away from tel aviv if Israel rejected does that mean the Israelis refuse peace?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;stop wishing for the destruction of the only Jewish state Israel being a Jewish state have nothing to do with the conflict from our side, it ain't religious. Furthermore most Palestinians don't want to destroy Israel, certainly the Palestinian leadership doesn't and had made countless efforts to achieve peace chief among was the oslo accords. What we want as Palestinians is our rights and the rights of our brothers in the dispora who have been displaced because of Israel, you being one of them.  gt;and to instead recognize Israel as a Jewish state and then achieving peace will be much easier. This isn't the issue, the issue is Israel refusal to allow displaced Palestinians back, even to a future Palestinian state. additionally Israel offers of peace have been nothing less than insulting, offering the new Palestinian state a Frankenstein of a territory that cannot be governed efficiently and will destroy Palestinian economy before it starts.  gt;We have fought with Jews in the region for 100 years now and having nothing to show for it. Fighting Israel does NOT work. The thing id we haven't fought israel. Israel was the country that started the fight and has fought us for 100 years, to this day they don't want an equal peace and have never came to the negotiating table with good intentions. they want us to surrender. what do you think we should do? surrendering is not an option and forgetting the refugee problem is out of negotiations. what gives Israel the right to refuse resettling Palestinian people who were displaced because of its creation in a independent future Palestinian state? The way you speak is just how zoinsts hasbarists speak, have you been listening to their propaganda lately?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is such a bullshit argument because you are trying to claim 14 million Palestinians didn't exist but here Zahir al-Umar al-Zaydani, was the autonomous #160;Arab #160;ruler of northern #160;Palestine #160;in the mid-18th century,[1] #160;For much of his reign, starting in the 1730s, his domain mainly consisted of #160;Galilee, with successive headquarters in #160;Tiberias, #160;Arraba, #160;Nazareth, #160;Deir Hanna #160;and finally #160;Acre, in 1746. He fortified Acre, and the city became a center of the cotton trade between Palestine and Europe. In the mid-1760s, he reestablished the port town of #160;Haifa #160;nearby. Zahir successfully withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman governors of the #160;Sidon #160;and #160;Damascus #160;provinces, who attempted to limit or eliminate his influence. The #160;Ottoman Navy #160;attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after. At the peak of his power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous #160;sheikhdom #160;extended from #160;Beirut #160;to #160;Gaza #160;and included the Jabal Amil and #160;Jabal Ajlun #160;regions. #160; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahir_al-Umar So yeah we existed and we will always exist you can take your bullshit argument else where</TEXT>

    <TEXT>many theories here i will copy paste for you since you Israelis apparently don't know how to use wikipedia The #160;English #160;term #160;Philistine #160;comes from #160;Old French #160;Philistin; from #160;Classical Latin #160;Philistinus; from #160;Late Greek #160;Philistinoi; ultimately from #160;Hebrew #160;P #601;li #353;t #238; #160;( #1508; #1500; #1513; #1514; #1497; #8206;; plural #160;P #601;li #353;t #238;m, #160; #1508; #1500; #1513; #1514; #1497; #1501; #8206;), meaning 'person of #160;P #601;le #353;eth #160;[ #1508; #1500; #1513; #1514; #8206;]'; and there are cognates in Akkadian #160;Palastu #160;and Egyptian #160;Palusata;[11] #160;the term #160;Palestine #160;has the same derivation.[12 Since 1846, scholars have connected the biblical Philistines with the Egyptian "Peleset" inscriptions.[17][18][19][20][21] #160;All five of these #160;appear from #160;c.1150 #160;BCE to #160;c.900 #160;BCE just as archaeological references to #160;Kina #7723; #7723;u, or #160;Ka-na-na #160;(Canaan), come to an end; A #160;Walistina #160;is mentioned in #160;Luwian #160;texts already variantly spelled #160;Palistina.[28][29][30] #160;This implies #160;dialectical #160;variation, a #160;phoneme #160;("f"?) inadequately described in the script,[31] #160;or both. Falistina was a kingdom somewhere on the Amuq plain, where the #160;Amurru kingdom #160;had held sway before it.[32] Another theory, proposed by Jacobsohn, is that the name derives from the attested #160;Illyrian #160;locality #160;Palaeste, whose inhabitants would have been called #160;Palaest #299;n #299; #160;according to normal grammatical practice.[33] Allen Jones (1972) suggests that the name #160;Philistine #160;represents a corruption of the Greek #160;phyle #160;histia #160;('tribe of the #160;hearth'), with the #160;Ionic #160;spelling of #160;hestia.[34] So now that the origin of the name is known I will clearly state that we as a people don't descend from only philistines but just like all people in history descend from all the people that inhibited the area, this includes the Philistines near gaza, the arab bedouins to the south, the canaanites in the north, and yes even the ancient jews who stayed after the roman expelled the ancestors (some of the ancestors because many of modren day Israelis descend from converts in yeman or central asia and europe) of modern day Israelis</TEXT>

I just linked you a wikipedia page of an autonomous ruler of Palestine that waged war on the ottoman empire with a Palestinian army and nearly won independence, and you still want a coin ? what do you want to say exactly? according to DNA analysis done by Israelis no less Palestinians descend largely from cananiets, here is a cananite coin https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan#/media/File%3ALaodikeia_Canaan.png as for the study on Lebanese and Palestinian dna : https://www.google.com/amp/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/history/2020/05/dna-from-biblical-canaanites-lives-modern-arabs-jews</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;it #8217;s quite silly to base a national movement on largely unknowable genetic claims to origins, This is the description of the zoinst movement, the Palestinian national movement is built on the idea that the displacement and ethinc cleanseing of Palestinian people from their land by terrorist gangs  gt;This is not correct. The question is somewhat difficult to analyze but there is evidence that Palestinians have significant overlap with other Arab populations. Can provide sources in interested. No reputable source that I found say that we have *significant* arab DNA, maybe closer to the desert. we mostly have levantine and a little Egyptian (or west asian) depending on the family. here is two sources https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/05/dna-from-biblical-canaanites-lives-modern-arabs-jews/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hussyni didn't know about the holocaust and only met the nazis to ask them to stop the nazi policy of encouraging jewish migrations to the holy land, later he collaborated with them (and this is unforgivable from my point of view) but It is very contested that he knew about the holocaust. furthermore husayni support of nazi Germany costed him so much, he was refused to be the leader of the Palestinian resistance and eventually died alone in Beirut. so I just can't see why is he called the Palestinians leader. the leaders of Israel also collaborated with the nazis and asked them for help yet I don't see you calling them anti semitic or educating the people about them (and those actually knew about the holocaust). January 1941, Stern attempted to make an agreement with the German Nazi authorities, offering to "actively take part in the war on Germany's side" in return for German support for Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state yet all I see is Israel giving stern honors and naming towns after him</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah nah, iran came in late The Israeli government funded Hamas in the early 1980s as part of a "divide and rule" strategy: to sow division among the Palestinian population by fueling the fringe Islamists and thus to forestall the ascendancy of Fatah and communist parties. In the early 1980s, #160;Brigadier General #160;Yitzhak Segev #160;was the Israeli military governor of Gaza, who explained that  #8220;The Israeli government gave me a budget, #8221; some of which was given "to the mosques". "Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel #8217;s creation, #8221; according to #160;Avner Cohen, Israeli religious affairs official who served for over 20 years in Gaza, who said he wrote an official report warning his government superiors against backing Palestinian Islamists against secularists.[116][117] so fuck hamas, but fuck the stupid evil people who thought this was a good idea</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He asked non muslims living in arab countries you are Israeli so why do you feel capable of answering? because as a Jordanian Palestinian by seeing what you wrote here  gt; In Jordan, the Druze there are not even allowed to wear their religious druze clothes or practice their religion they are forced to read the Quran and go to the mosque, How come are they forced to go to the mousqes when literly most Jordanians don't go? and who is forcing them to read the quran? I mean I am a Muslim and the last time I opened it was 14 years ago, pretty sure most of amman youth is the same. no body forcing us No offense but I am pretty sure you are mis-informed as for violence against druze by Palestinians, when was this? what is your source? in Syria there is a civil war, more Sunnis muslims died in Syria than anyone else, every body is at every body throats. sadly and unfortunately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>correct me but we know that many greeks immigrated to the Levant during the ottoman empire and also during the byzantine empire, especially Beirut, sarsouki family being the most notable we also have instances were arab tribes immigrated and split between Christianity and islam, like the asali and the shihabs So I think geographic location is the most important in this topic Probably northren Palestinians fellhas (not from the cities) muslims and Christians will have the most levantine DNA tied maybe with the fellahis of Lebanon</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;How recent were these newcomers? most Bedouin tribes entered the Palestinian north after 1830~ (after the Palestinian revolution aganist the turkish-egyptian occupation where 20% percent of the male Palestinian population was decimated) same with the Egyptians, those were seen as people who came to replace us, because rich lords employed them in the land after the revolt, so animosity between the two lasted maybe until 1948. it still lives to a lesser extent in the villages when we yrefuse to marry from masri families and they refuse to marry from us. although lately (20 years) every thing is changing and it seems that the animosity is dying (old people, 60+ still have racism though) (the masri people adopted the same dilect but can be known from the face or from the family name, the Bedouins to this day speak a different dialect)  gt;No, Greek migrants were to little number to name any significant impact on the population regardless of the time period. There is something called Hellenization of Levant and Anatolia during the Hellenistic and Roman era. I don't agree that only small numbers arrived, comparable at least with the arabs who you claim changed the demographics in the muslim community.  gt;I don't know enough to make a statement about the fellahin. I need data to work on. are your family originally from a village or a city?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The grammar is basically the same, and I totally mean it, exactly the same the difference is that hebrew use words that are also found in arabic but they aren't used in the same context or in the same way for example is the word  #1581; #1575; #1606; #1608; #1578; #1548;  #1495; #1504; #1493; #1514; that is used exclusively in hebrew to mean store, in arabic it means store too but outside literary sources you will not find it used. the same with the word medina, in arabic it refers to a city meanwhile in Hebrew it refers to a country the word for bread and meat is also almost the same, lehm, but the meaning is different (although the connection between bread and meat is easy to understand) the word yam means sea in arabic but no body use it out side of the Quran and literary sources and instead people say bahar, in Hebrew yam is the every day word for sea there is also the question of modern Hebrew loosing 7 letters (I think) that are still found in Arabic because the European jews couldn't say it( they even still have a problem with letter  #1495; with is supposed to be pronounced  #1581; but is pronounced as  #1582; ( #1582; #1608; #1605; #1608; #1589;) I am currently living in jordan and I am self taught in hebrew and took a university course so I am no expert, but those are what I learned</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What lies did I spread in my comment? you think nut jobs right wingers like you can't be terrorists? not long ago did the Muslim community lose more than 51 soul to hatful people like you, you probably partied then. the vast majority of the muslim community that believes in god and the quran are peaceful and nice people, but your hate is blinding you. instead on focusing on the positive and trying to spread tolerance you spread hate. you by spreading hatred and non tolerance how are you better than those who you claim to fight?  gt;Because you're clearly spreading lies and then pretending as if you're not excusing the disgusting bigotry and violence that pops up anytime someone burns or insults or criticises a Quran.  gt;The Muslim community that embraces the Quran as the holy word of God and as entirely inscrutible deserves nothing but disrespect, it's a vile text and supports vile things if you take it even somewhat literally, and only the most vague and desperate interpretations can remove the horrible crap that's supported, encouraged, and outline as proper behaviour that's in that book.</TEXT>

I was okay with pan-Arabism until I realized what a backward shithole the whole Middle East has turned into. I no longer believe in pan-Arabism. so when the middle east turned to shit you stopped believing in pan arabism? and back then it was more shit or the same, colonialism still was new, the majority were non educated and wealth concentrated in the pockets of a handful, but people back then believed they could do something and fix it. today you are all trying to immigrate and run away from problems</TEXT>

    <TEXT>fun fact the European renaissance only became possible because of the works of ibn zuhr and ibn sina they took the classical Greek philosophy and tried to adapt it to monotheistic religions which made it much more acceptable and accessible to European scholars the same people were deemed heretics and thier books were burned by a very influential islamic scholar named ghazali (although they themselves were also islamic scholars and sharia judges), this gazhali still have major influence on the middle east religious teachings until today muslims also were very interested in all science so they gathered science from the east and the west bringing papers and gunpowder wepones from china and math and philosophy from india and Greece plus all the knowledge in egypt, iraq and syria. all was translated into arabic which made science accessible to the upper middle class people and preserved the books. many major inventions were made during the Islamic golden age that we even use today, particularly in medicine and mathematics but also in chemistry (they invented destled alcohol and gave the name spirit drinks)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I meant after the Arab invasion of the 7th century the persians basically recreated the arab world, they were part of it. starting from the language and sibawaiyh to the main religious scholars like bukhari. iran it self was the center of the arab world until the savadis forcibly converted iran to shiasim (iran and iraq were the bastions of Sunni Islam, and Egypt was the main Shia country). architecture, cuisines, customs were exchanged and ideas expanded. The often repeated "Iranians hate arabs because of the 7th century invasion" is a modern invented concept, and in it self is stupid because the arabs were the first to revolt against Islam and tried to stop it when the prophet died but failed in the rida wars. when the Iranians revolted and succeeded they created the abbasid caliphate, they didn't get rid of islam. Seeing the Iranian diaspora discredit the history of Islamic iran and the good realtions arabs and Persians had, for no other reason but to confirm to western attitudes, is both sad and cringe worthy</TEXT>

The Idea that arabs originated deep in the peninsula is wrong.

    <TEXT> gt;seeing how they would equal or even slightly surpass the Jewish population you can vote in a secular bi-national state that respects the rights of everybody. The Jewish Israeli voters oppose the formation of a state were jews aren't the majority and anybody who even thinks of suggesting that is committing suicide (political and physical as had happened with the last Israeli president to propose that, I think his name was rabin or something) The Jewish voters refuse to give the right of return to Palestinian refugees even to the west bank and Gaza solely on ideological ground that the land of "historical Israel" should be majority jewish. not long ago (2 years maybe) did the Jewish voters vote to abolish the state of Arabic as a official language (Arabic has been an official language since thd British mandate) and the Israeli president just stated that Israel is the state of only its Jewish citizens, giving a middle finger to all arabs, including bedouins and druze who are mandatory conscripted into the army (or face jail time) do you expect those people to accept such proposition? they won't, and as a Palestinian I won't too. in my opinion two states or nothing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay I was wrong and I learned something new here are the facts 1) beit harava The village was originally established in 1939 2) Kalia, according to wikipedia this was built in 1929 as housing block for the Palestin potash company (its part owned by non other than the brother of abd al kader al Hussainy), the company employed both arabs and jews, how do you consider that to be a settlement then? the actual settlement was built in 1968  gt;The Jewish settlement in Hebron again how do you consider that a settlement? despite the brainwashing you go through as a hasbarists you must know that jews living in a city=/= settlement in the sense of jewish settlements in the west bank (closed communities of facists), the jews of khalil were a part of the Palestinian people, and before the 1917 balfour declaration they flourished in the city (also no the jewish inhabitants in khalil started to arrive their in 1830 and aren't ancient as you claim, the crusaders killed the ancient community of jews during the first crusade. (most others converted to Islam or Christianity long before) does the jewish quarter in milan mean that jews had a settlement in italy? no 4)silwan you're wrong this village was established pre 980 because an arab traveler mentioned it by name 5)  gt;The entire Etsion block, The core group includes four Jewish agricultural villages that were founded in 1940 #8211;1947  gt;Also, the "cult" you mentioned is an offshoot of the Mea Shearim ultra-orthodox community... The same ones who are against the existence of Israel (Not really due to empathy for the Palestinians, but simply because they believe Israel can't exist until the Messiah returns) this doesn't change a thing and doesn't mean that whaf I said is wrong so why did you bring it?  gt;And those are just the ones in the West Bank. There were Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip and even the Golan Heights before 1948. you keep saying that word loosely possibility in order to justify the current settlements, so to keep everything clear those rare historic "settlements" both in the west bank and gaza and the golan heights were at most communities of 150 people and were at best (for your cause) established after 1925. The vast majorty of jewish settlement in Palestine was near the coast, particularly tel aviv old neighborhoods</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Hurva Synagogue, which had also been used as a military base in the conflict, were destroyed  gt;and it was said  gt;Please, all sides of the conflict made horrible things, but trying to deny events ever happened is one of the reasons the conflict continues. while I agree that all sides did bad things the conflict was started by zoinstsand most of the horrible things were done by them, for every arab attack I can namd you ten haganah terrorist attacks and for every desecrated syngouge I can show you a 5 mosques tufned bars (that are still in use). but let us leave this aside, you say that this is thd reason that the conflict still continues, I disagree. the only reason the conflict still continues is because the Israeli public is overwhelmingly composed of fascists who have are drunk on military power and vote accordingly. Israel could end the conflict tommorw if it wanted by simply leaving the west bank, gaza alone and allowing the return of refugees, the Palestinians are already agreeing to 1967 borders, but peace isn't what Israel wants, it wants to remove the Palestinians and steal their land and resources</TEXT>

If I was to argue in the same line of thought as you do then no ancient german,greek, French or roman artifacts exist because today the modern populations of those countries don't have much connection to the ancient people. it is the Egyptian pepole artifact and it is only right for it to be returned where the same people can go and appreciate their ancestors legacy, without the need to travel to Germany to do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually agree with you in the post, I am not advocating for exporting desert sand but utilizing the natural resources we have in order to create a product that is in demand and can be sold internationally, bringing in hard currency and expanding thd gdp while also creating jobs. In my opinion the most in-demand thing right now in the world is green energy via solar power, we have lots of silca (sand) and magnesium (dead sea) plus easy access to (right now) cheap khaliji gas, our universities and engineers must focus on the process of manufacturing and betterment of high quality solar panels, and hopefully trying to make our country a global leader in manufacturing them. the solar panel market is estimated to reach 230 billion by 2026, the economy of Jordan today is 87 billion, this if taken seriously will create many jobs and will also bring much needed economic prosperity to the country. The availability of localy manufactured solar energy will also help free the country from its dependence on foreign fossil fuel further reducing the export import deficit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Take a look at the early life of palestine and you'll notice it started out as part of a pan-arabist plan to force back the jews by establishing a palestinian identity as a counter force. People moved from surrounding arab countries to palestine just for that reason. Iirc it's even confirmed by their head official at that time. this is bullshit to call us an invented race is offensive and stupid especially when all historical evidence points to the contrary and that evidence of the Israelis being a mish mash of different races is everywhere</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It shed light on your position yes but I have to inform you that you have been misinformed no arab migration from nearby countries occurred during the british mandate and the only recent arab migration into the land happened in the 1850 from Egypt but the people who migrated still have the name masri (egyptian) and they and the native Palestinians don't mix and were enemies until recently. the zoinsts spread misinformation in order to justify the war crimes committed, even today zoinsts aren't more than the Palestinians (if you take into account the Palestinians who were ethically cleansed), realize that the idf have an electronic army. The young Jewish state also engaged in destroying Islamic heritage sites (chief of the grave of the grandson of the prophet mohamed) in order to remove the arab identity in the land, something that the azaris have been victims of in the recent conflict. however large precntges of Palestinian Christians are arminenis and we respect the community very much, I have been to both Azerbaijan and Armenia and honestly guys you are all so similar and I am very sad that this war is happening, both people were nice and very honest and I respect both of you, I don't support any side in this conflict, I support both people and wish for peace between you most Palestinians are split however, muslims are supportive of azribjan and Christians of Armenia seeing azeri muslims fall for zoinst bullshit only saddens me,</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Having a militia taking control of your country and launching military attacks on another country is normal It was all through contracts and in agreements the Lebanese majority accepted the situation at the time the Palestinians didn't force themselves on them. what happened was that some Christians didn't want that but other wanted, it was a Democracy and the majority accepted the agreement. how does that give people like the kateab the right to kill Palestinians? furthermore at that point Israel and the PLO were in a ceasefire that the PLO has fully respected for some time (few years)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;There #8217;s a reason why the Jordanian government didn #8217;t want them. They #8217;re savages who don #8217;t have respect for human life. The Jordanians wanted them out for political reasons (I believe jordan made the right call by the way) not because they were "savages"  gt;I #8217;ve met LITERALLY no one in Lebanon who likes the plo. So we #8217;re all brainwashed and you #8217;re the enlightened one. yes  gt;Look up how the war started. It #8217;s well known. I have looked it up it is very evident that the kateab did start it On the morning of 13 April 1975, unidentified gunmen in a speeding car fired on a church in the Christian #160;East Beirut #160;suburb of Ain el-Rummaneh, killing four people, including two #160;Maronite #160;Phalangists. Hours later, Phalangists led by the #160;Gemayels #160;killed 30 #160;Palestinians #160;traveling in Ain el-Rummaneh. Citywide clashes erupted in response to this "Bus Massacre". The #160;Battle of the Hotels #160;began in October 1975, and lasted until March in 1976. so an unidentified person kills four people and the kataeb blames this on the Palestinians, how did the PLO start the war? I hate the PLO with my guts too but they didn't start the war</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nah it was actually pro science but what happened is that a rift between religious scholars happened in the 11th century and one particular very important islamic scholar (ghazali) to this day won, books like "The Incoherence of the Philosophers" and the answer to it "The Incoherence of the Incoherence" were written, eventually philosophy became a negative thing. The anti philosophy religious extremists won and the subsequent crusades, reconqusita, Mongol invasion and burning of baghdad and after it Tamerlan all but crippled the Islamic world until the ottomans who were more into spirituality than science, after that colonialism happened and only ended in the year 1960 and the rise of salafist movements</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First west bank cities have nothing to do with the argument since west bankers can't enter the Israeli territories without a permit, I am talking about what you call "arab Israelis". but even so here are some thoughts about what you wrote  gt;Well, don't confuse our PM to the rest of the population; he's doing shitty things in order to divide and conquer - that's his strategy and motive. aren't you a Democracy? in a democracy the politicians reflect the majority Netanyahu isn't a dictator like the PA, if many people didn't like what he says he wouldn't have stayed as the prime minister for the last 10 years or so  gt; I can safely say that my entire social circle is filled with people who see you as their equals. nice to hear that, I have a question do you think a two state solution is possible?  gt;Arent Israelis banned from entering West Bank palestinian settlements? they actually aren't, the Israeli army puts those signs as a warning to the Israeli citizens it isn't the Palestinians stopping them, furthermore many jewish Israelis vist and buy from arab villages in the border areas of the west bank because it is usually cheaper and many westerns go to thd west bank no body is stopping you from going their and speaking English  gt;and you drag our corpses through Ramallah when we accidently enter it. I am a firm believer in a peaceful solution and i don't agree with violence and I consider what happened as wrong, but context is important, it is of paramount importance to your argument that you mention that those were no ordinary citizens they were soldiers wearing military gear and clothes and this was during the intifada (Palestinian uprising) and tensions were high, once again context is important. also this happened in the west bank and not in "arab Israeli" towns  gt;The law you mentioned was highly condemned by most Israelis, it was supported by such a small and insignificant part of the population one has to wonder - why was it even suggested? genuinely asking, why did it pass with a majority then?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;if you want to drop your citizenship there's a form for that. also you will lose all your ancestral land because of the israeli law and the right for you or for your descents to vist your historical birthplace and the ability to vist the holiest places on earth if you're a muslim or Christian because when you do that you are automatically a Palestinian refugee and Israel doesn't allow those to even visit their lands of course getting a second passport from a western country makes this easier but then again getting a second passport is hard</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You realize that you can use the exact same argument to say that they don't belong in Israel, right? how so?  gt;Libanon is currently way more of an apartheid state than Israel, and UNRWA and the PLO are abusing the Palestinian "refugees" to fool naive westerners to donate money to their corrupt leaders. This is exactly why all Palestinian refugees must be allowed to get back into thier rightful land, or at least to a future Palestinian state. why is Israel even asking those stupid terms? what do they have to gain by not allowing Palestinians a return even to a future Palestinian state in the west bank? Also it seems that you are the brainwashed here, since I am living this reality and is actually seeing and comparing everything by my own eyes and logic not by the help of any media source biased or not</TEXT>

    <TEXT>aren't you the geocidal maniacs' that decimated the fertile crescent in the past? ## (D-2) The Standardization of Terror The most vital part of the Assyrian government was its army. Warfare was a science to the leaders of Assyria. Infantry, chariots, cavalry (introduced by Ashurnasirpal to aid the infantry and chariots), sappers, armor made from iron, siege machines, and battering rams were all developed or perfected by the Assyrians. Strategy and tactics were also well understood by the Assyrian officers. (See Durant, *Our Oriental Heritage,* 1:270 #8211;71.) But it was not just Assyrian effectiveness in warfare that struck terror to the hearts of the Near Eastern world. They were savage and brutal as well.  #8220;A captured city was usually plundered and burnt to the ground, and its site was deliberately denuded by killing its trees. The loyalty of the troops was secured by dividing a large part of the spoils among them; their bravery was ensured by the general rule of the Near East that all captives in war might be enslaved or slain. Soldiers were rewarded for every severed head they brought in from the field, so that the aftermath of a victory generally witnessed the wholesale decapitation of fallen foes. Most often the prisoners, who would have consumed much food in a long campaign, and would have constituted a danger and nuisance in the rear, were dispatched after the battle; they knelt with their backs to their captors, who beat their heads in with clubs, or cut them off with cutlasses. Scribes stood by to count the number of prisoners taken and killed by each soldier, and apportioned the booty accordingly; the king, if time permitted, presided at the slaughter. The nobles among the defeated were given more special treatment: their ears, noses, hands and feet were sliced off, or they were thrown from high towers, or they and their children were beheaded, or flayed alive, or roasted over a slow fire. #160; #8230; Rich coming from you</TEXT>
