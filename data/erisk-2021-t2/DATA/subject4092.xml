    <TEXT>Was the Mercedes AMG 'double stack' the smoothest pit stop of all-time?  #8203; Maybe it's just because it was so recent, but with the pressure of having to make a faultless pit stop, the Mercedes AMG F1 team made it look so simple, and nobody broke stride.  #8203; I know the Williams team have had some fast pit stops (maybe because the car is so slow to get to them?) but I'm struggling to think of a better stop in my 20-odd years of watching F1. https://preview.redd.it/megk42665zs21.jpg?width=1024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=3296fc14b3ed951162e9019599ef0ac0371807f4</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are several apps, but they're all (in my experience) unreliable as they were showing friends that had interacted with my content as inactive/ghost followers.  #8203; So far, the best way I've found to do a clear out is to jump onto something like Upwork and hire someone for a few $ an hour to keep going through the list and unfollowing people.  #8203; Give them some criteria like 'look for followers that have names that are random letters/numbers thrown together' and so on, then get them to block or unfollow those accounts first.  #8203; That should refine the list a lot, then you can do a sweep once the number is more manageable.  #8203; Keep in mind they'll only be able to unfollow about 100 people an hour, so with 11,000 it'll take some time.  #8203; Then to get it turned around, initially, you're going to have to do some hard yards leaving genuine comments on accounts. I'd search for hashtags (or local area if it's a bricks  amp; mortar place) and interact with people who look like they're doing some DIY, renovations, building etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well you have a lot going on haha.  #8203; Something to seriously consider is getting something like eClincher so you can create a weeks worth of posts at once then schedule them for posting, because it is a huge time suck to think of content every day, then try and post it on your phone, switching accounts etc.  #8203; Just get into a zone, create everything, and schedule. For the amount of accounts you're looking at, I'd set aside a good 3-4 hours initially.  #8203; When you do this, you can spend more time on arguably the most important part: engagement, Leaving genuine comments (and likes) on pics for people you think may want to follow you and become a customer.  #8203; If I was starting this, I would go all-in first on your partner's account as it can be 'easier' to build a following for someone who is good looking than for a business/product.  #8203; Get her alllllll the teeth whitening and skinny tea endorsements!  #8203; Then once she has an audience, she can be the 'influencer' for the other things you want to launch.  #8203; Consistency is key, again if it was me I'd outsource heavy lifting things like creating imagery, hashtag research, even the actual scheduling so you can focus on engaging captions and interacting with people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha yeah it gets confusing and can be expensive. I've used a bunch, like Buffer, Hootsuite, Sendible, and eClincher. I'm liking eClincher the most for functionality and reliability. You can do things tag accounts and add location in IG with it. eClincher also finds relevant hashtags for you. You put one in, let's say '#InstaModel' and it will find some that are similar. Personally I prefer to make my own 'bank' and save them in Evernote, then copy/paste them in. Using a ration of 10 hashtags between 5000-10000 posts, 5 hashtags from 10000 to 50000 posts, 10 hashtaggs from 50000 to 100000 posts, and 5 'free kicks' with posts in the millions, or room for branded/event specific hashtags. Takes about 20 minutes, but you can keep them for months and they'll be the most relevant. BTW if you do go with eClincher, would you mind helping me out? They pay a referral fee, you'd just need to send me the email address you register with if that's ok?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This might be an over-simplifaction without having all the context around the event, but I'd ask them :-)  #8203; So I'm making an assumption that people have an idea of the sport/event, or something close to it, and even if the sport is newly invented, there is something it resembles.  #8203; What I would do is then work out where the people who already follow the similar sport hang out, both online and offline, and ask them.  #8203; For example if you're making a new NFL, then you know NFL fans hang out in bars watching games, and you can find places like subreddits and Facebook groups where they discuss it.  #8203; Then, ask!  #8203; People are often really happy to help when the person asking is honest about why they're asking.  #8203; Then from the answers, you actually get specific wording you can use in content (landing pages, FB ads, YouTube scripts etc) as if one person in your niche is thinking/feeling something, it will most likely resonate with others who follow the same sport.  #8203; It can be harder and more uncomfortable going out and asking, but I've always found it gets the best responses and information.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Video, video, video.  #8203; You're going to need to cut together highlights from the previous event so it looks appealing to people, making them feel like they're going to miss out if they don't go.  #8203; Play on people's fear of missing out.  #8203; Also video's from people who went last year, talking about how amazing it was and how they can't wait to go again. Doesn;t need to be world class, just shot on a phone will do.  #8203; Then you could potentially even try IG 'influencers'. If you don't have a buget it'll be tough, but hey, maybe you could set up like a 'VIP Room' at the event that has catering etc and give the influencers a ticket for them and two friends. Then you'll get the double-whammy of them promoting the event before it happens, and creating content while they're at the event.  #8203; Just be prepared for a lot of rejection, as most influencers like to be paid in money not free things :-)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Formula 1 Boring? - Article with analysis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-21 23:25:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know I'm putting myself in the line of fire here, but after every race it seems to have become popular to jump onto FB pages etc and complain that F1 is boring and has to change.  #8203; I'm old enough to remember other periods of domination like the one we're seeing with Mercedes now, so I took a week or so to analyse previous periods (such as the years Ferrari/Schumacher dominated) and compared winning percentages across years as it seemed the most accurate way to compare, given the number of races per season and the points on offer have changed over the years.  #8203; I'd be keen to hear feedback on any areas I might have missed, and if I should do something similar to compare backmarkers? Williams are slow and off the pace, but how do they compare to previous backmarkers? Any interest?  #8203; [https://f1chronicle.com/is-formula-1-boring/](https://f1chronicle.com/is-formula-1-boring/) https://preview.redd.it/5ayi2287enz21.jpg?width=1024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=bbe57ae49372999c20302e8496e8226035613f37</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, JPM certainly did make things more interesting! Perhaps being a disgruntled McLaren fan I was watching through frustration ;-) I suspect you're right, RBR have some excellent minds at work, and have a good budget too. Likewise Honda have some great minds, it won't surprise me at all if they knock off Mercedes sooner rather than later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sucks that this is happening, but from experience, the absolute best thing you can do is enrol him in some personal development courses that help develop self confidence and skills he can use after school, such as public speaking.  #8203; And not an online course, that won't help, an in-person one where he has to go and talk with real people.  #8203; Now given his age, and the fact he will most likely resist your efforts, I'd also suggest you go with him to the first one or two.

    <TEXT>From experience the two best things you can do to help are:  #8203; 1) When you get home from work, you look after the baby so your wife can do whatever she wants. Sorry f this means giving a few after work activities/things for relaxation up haha! But the baby will be asleep pretty early anyway. For the first couple of weeks you'll think 'omg I'll never get to do anything other than clean and wash again!' but then you get better/faster at it, and things calm down.  #8203; 2) If you can afford it, keep the nanny around for one day a week so your wife can do other things. The other things might still be baby related, but having that time means she gets to keep her 'identity' rather than have it wrapped up in the baby. Not sure if I explained that well, but point being, she will love having one day a week where she can do her own things.</TEXT>
