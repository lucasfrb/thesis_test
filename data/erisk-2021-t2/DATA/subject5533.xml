    <DATE>2020-06-19 14:47:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Does anyone else feel like note blocks should be a bigger part of the game? I feel like they'd be used a lot more if you could have an option to see the note it's on or have a GUI you can choose the note from. Maybe even an option to add how long notes hold for or something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who can't vote or be in any political position (I just turned 16) I oppose BLM due to a lot of radical ideas they have or some of them have. The website has horrible ideologies that as an American I will never support. The "protests" should not happen during a pandemic while all the blame is put on political rallies, restaurants and what not. They've gotten way too out of hand for me to even want to listen to what they say anymore. I have yet to hear a logical "defund the police" statement because in my opinion they need to just handle the money better by making more stations to have faster response time. I also hate the A list celebrities or companies pushing it to their audience with horrible descriptions especially when the audience are typically teens.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[SUPPORT] BIOS recovery mode on RAM upgrade</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-19 03:56:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>(ASUS Prime X470) I just upgraded from HyperX Fury 16gb 2x8 2133mhz to Corsair Vengeance 16gb 8x2 3200mhz and when I installed it everything was fine but I turned off pc to go to BIOS and switched it from 2133 to 3200 obviously and now it won't boot and wants me to get a file "PX47OP.CAP" which I can't get for a while due to no other pc or usb or anything. Is there another fix?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just upgraded from 2133mhz HyperX Fury RAM to 3200mhz because I'm getting a 2080 super soon. Everything went fine until I turned my pc back off to change my Corsair Vengeance Pro to 3200mhz and then it tells me this warning about bios recovery mode. I went through all that and even went all the way to Walmart to buy a USB just to do that. It still would not work but will easily boot at 2133mhz. Any fix to this because google did not help one bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So im upgrading from a 960 2gb to an RTX 2080 Super at the moment (650w PSU) and im not sure how to plug it in right. The cable for the GPU has a wire going up, splits off into a 6+2pin and then keeps going to another 6+2 pin. The GPU requires a 6+8 pin so do i plug one of the 6 pins into the left and then 6+2 on the right or do i need a different PSU?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So after months of issues with mechanicalkeyboards not sending the keyboard, I finally got it and after 2/3 weeks of use it no longer works. If I plug it into the keyboard it says overcurrent detected and won't boot. I've tried different ports, disabling BIOS settings for USB boot, other cables etc. and nothing works. Is there a way I can open it up and fix it or is it a goner?</TEXT>
