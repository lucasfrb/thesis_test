    <TEXT>Posted this on another Reddit for self harm but thought I might as well cover all the bases XD. So I've had a problem with self harm for a long time but after high school and into community college I was self harm free. 2 years under my belt and then the first semester of a 4 year college experience and I slip. It wasn't anything big or bad at first but its escalated with me being stuck at home alone, nothing quite that deep but I am littered with bruises and cuts all over my body. I even found myself tracing back over the carved "freak" on my thigh from years ago. I've been wanting to cut deeper or break a bone and that's terrifying to me. So I took the first step and got myself a psychiatrist but they seem laissez faire about it all, like since I haven't acted on cutting deeper (though still leaving visible scaring) and because my suicidal thoughts are more passive than active they're just wanting to handle it with monthly meetings. I'm not sure that will be beneficial to me as my behavior has become such a habit/addiction that isn't being interrupted and therefore any handling of my thoughts or feelings come after the harm not before. I know a lot of people don't like inpatient care but I think that would be the best thing for me at this point--active forced discussion and intervention--but I'm feeling kind of iffy about asking for it. I'm not sure if its the psychiatrist's words getting to me or not but I keep feeling like I don't actually deserve inpatient care because I'm not "bad" enough (which of course is triggering me into getting worse). I would love to hear y'all's thoughts on this: Has anyone had inpatient care without extremely deep scars? How was that experience? Should I try more appointments with my psychiatrist before making a final decision on this or go with my intuition? I think I'm just looking for some helpful outlooks and supportive messages. Love this community and happy to finally join for real! \-Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How about the Altered Beast This is the Run? With every upgrade either increase speed or incline. If they both die bring the treadmill back to regular and start again. It should be a good source of variation! Honestly a similar thing could be done with any This is the Runs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really on par with all the other suggestions (I agree with Ticket to Ride if you want more of a traditional board game) but my main go to for middle school aged kids and family fun is Munchkin. Its easy to pick up, easy to set up, competitive without being too competitive and it comes in completely playable by themselves packs themed around kids and adults favorite cartoons. Playing with my TMNT or Oz munchkin decks with kids at summer camp quickly became their favorite part of the day while also being a great stress reliever for me. Villainous is a bit more difficult to explain game play wise because every villain has their own win condition but it's another that's pretty fun with a tween/teen audience. It's Disney themed with the win conditions and cards themed around the villains and their motivations in the movies. A bit more strategy based but with 6 different villains in the main pack for everyone to try out (as well as replaying the same villain after gaining a better understanding of their strategy) it's great for repeat play.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Starving myself and skipping meals is a common one. I've started to also exercise to the extreme instead as well, not like regular fitness but intense long periods of activity which makes me unable to move and exhausted or physically hurt from straining something. Had thoughts about alcohol or drugs but trying to stay away from them. Never tried smoking and never will, can't get past it with my history of pneumonia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 7 sins are not there for you to necessarily avoid. Sins are something that humans do, just by existing, they are supposed to sin. The whole thing about religion is acknowledging that you've sinned and taking steps to be absolved for that (through prayer, community service, confession), it's not to stop sinning altogether.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interviews are really of the mindset of best foot forward. Like you get dressed up completely for it, wear cologne/perfume, do makeup, get on heels and an air of professionalism. With all that in mind it makes since to cover scars for an interview, they work similarly to a tattoo at the time where there visibility could cost you a job. But! The people you work with are generally not the people who hire you and the work environment is less strict professional attire than the interview. Feel free to wear clothes that may show your scars as you settle into your job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this is a super old post (was going through all time rated) but I thought I'd give a little exercise tip as it sounds like running isn't working for you. So I have severe social anxiety--enough so that even exercising at home alone gives me anxiety as if like what I'm in the Truman Show--it's horrid. So for the longest time I had trouble losing the weight I've put on during my depression episodes. One thing that helped a lot was essentially tricking myself into daily mile long walks. I've found that when I rant to myself about something or when I listen to a podcast that is thought provoking I pace. Pacing around my house for an hour is equal to a mile long walk. It's a great simple exercise without feeling like one and as it allows me to rant to myself about my day it's fairly cathartic and helps reduce the anxiety I feel late at night in bed. I lost 10lbs in under a month just walking. You can also change it up by walking up stairs or with groceries in your arms (because the whole thing for it to work is to trick yourself that you aren't exercising). You might not need to trick yourself if that doesn't make you anxious but it really helped me feel better about my body even when I was bigger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey OP! I had this exact problem too. I could be doing absolutely nothing , just lying in bed, when I would get a sudden pain in my chest that made it difficult to take big breaths and move, then it would suddenly just go away after a bit. Didn't figure anything out until a YouTube comment actually, said to look into precordial catch syndrome. Did a bit of research and felt a lot better about my craziness. Now I'm not going to try to diagnose you with it because it sounds like your situation is worsening and I can't exactly relate to that and you specifically asked people not to but I just wanted to let you know you're not alone in feeling like this and having doctors be baffled. Hope it gets better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA? I'm actually not sure on this one because I do agree it was best to stop dating if you don't find them attractive anymore and that's the ultimate question you were asking about here. Staying in that relationship isn't good for either of you. It's just that it seems based on this post that your attractiveness towards your gf was inherently based on her physical appearance and that in itself means you're an asshole. 180 isn't big, this quarantine is affecting many with symptoms of depression which can lead to weight gain, based on her history of love of exercise she'd shed this weight as soon as this situation was over, and you're shallow. I think that covered everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So personally I find this disgusting and it would be a relationship breaker for me. I'm currently 22, in college, and I can't even fathom looking at a 16 y/o and feeling attraction. I'm mean that's straight up pedophilia. Maybe thinking about it in these terms would help you figure out your feelings on it. He's a junior at most. He just got his license, he just now can drive a car. He can't vote. He can't buy cigarettes or lotto tickets. When asked how his day went he'll be talking about highschool classes. He goes on field trips. His parents probably buy his stuff for him. Like he's a literal child. She dated a child and had sex with a child and somehow can't see the harm in that (like I can't even think back to me as 16 and think I was mature). Honestly it's a problem and I'd be getting out of the relationship now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ESH As I'm unsure whether his behavior was deliberate or not so I won't excuse it with a straight he's not an asshole. BUT! Whether it was or wasn't on purpose you should have sat him down and had an honest conversation about your feelings and the future of your relationship if you can't trust him to acknowledge your consent. You know, like adults. Retaliating in kind to him was sexual assault, period. There was no consent involved and you did it with the intent to hurt/teach him a lesson. If he didn't do it on purpose you've basically shown your cards on how you handle situations in a manipulative and abusive way and even if he did do it on purpose stooping to his level makes you as bad as he was!</TEXT>

I like the idea of it being Mikey because he's always seen as the youngest and most heartwarming character so if would be fun to see him broken (sorry Mike). But I also love the idea of it being Don hyperfocusing on revenge/survival and essentially having a mental breakdown over everything. It will be interesting to see where it all goes!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello! I'm so sorry you have to deal with all of this. It just sounds like all this bad stuff is stacking up on you. I think it's quite amazing that you can speak/understand 4 languages! I also agree that it is beneficial in many ways and can see why your mom taught you in this way. That all being said I 100% get the feeling of that many languages being a hindrance to your mental health and understanding of the world around you. Words/phrases can have extremely different meanings across different languages and having that many languages to pull from in your head means listening, speaking, reading, or any kind of processing takes more time and effort than it does for others. And a lot of the time other people don't care to wait for you. As for your mental health, don't be afraid to self diagnosis. It won't get you any medicine but there are many tips, tricks, communities, and therapies that you can do/participate in at home that can greatly improve your mental health. For example, I'm fairly sure I have ADHD but the going to the doctor for a diagnosis for it terrifies me so instead I incorporate ADHD strategies into my everyday. This has helped me handle those symptoms as well as just made me feel better in a little way. And if possible maybe look through other people's posts on their mental health and find ones similar to how your feeling, showing people those might be easier for them to understand than you trying to explain on your own (although having to do this kinda sucks on your end). As someone who struggles with self harming behavior I completely understand how it helps when you feel bad. I'm sorry you feel like you have to resort to that to feel better. Next, you are NOT a freak for not having sexual attraction or for wanting to kiss a girl. You are completely valid and I wholeheartedly agree that you shouldn't have to kiss someone for others to treat you with respect. Keep on living whether that be for your mom or your neighbor. Keep on and hopefully soon you'll feel a bit better. I hope you find some people who understand you. Stay safe.</TEXT>

My problem is your argument of "oh if you don't want to see it don't look for it" bullshit. Here's a fun fact for you NO ONE HERE WAS LOOKING FOR IT. Just like when I search for TMNT on social sites I'm not looking for tcest, it's just there and if it's there on my regular thing to search for results it's there on children's regular searched for results. It's the mlp problem all over again. Kinks and sexual explorations of characters have their area but as soon as that becomes a problem to the safety of children or unsuspecting people just trying to participate in a fandom then something needs to be done for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is what I got from my therapist as well. They are not qualified to diagnose you and generally are just there to talk to you about things. That being said some of those mental illnesses you described don't get much help from knowing the underlying causes. Depression is a big one that is helped by this but I never felt knowing where my anxiety stems from helps me in those situations. I'd suggest dropping the therapist and picking up a psychologist instead. Psychiatrists can diagnosis you but that's really all they are there for, psychologists from my experience work with me to create methods for handling my illnesses and help me by challenging my self-talk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YTA. I literally had something like this happen to me recently. My father and I were out shopping and we're thinking about buying apples. So we are standing at the apple kiosk thing and then suddenly I look up to an employee in a floor cleaner staring me down. He doesn't say a single thing just looks at me. I grab my dad and move out of the way and then dude just drives and cleans that spot, still no talking. This is SUPER RUDE. How am I supposed to know to move if I don't even know I'm in the way? It's polite to just say a simple excuse me so that I know to either hurry up or move. Being excused makes me slightly apologetic but overall doesn't affect me negatively while the other would give me negative emotions. Also when has excuse me not been the polite thing to do!? Bike riders know to say on your left or right when they pass you so you can get out of the way. Letting someone know/have more situational awareness is always the nice thing to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly the three years difference isn't that big of a deal especially since they were dating before he was an adult. That being said the rest of the story and how the relationship has progressed is raising some alarm bells. I wouldn't go as far as manipulative or abusive but certainly damaging, the relationship feels like it has run its course. YWNBTA tell it like it is, it's unhealthy for them to stay together if sex is all he wants from her. Maybe suggest she sits him down and talks about everything.</TEXT>

I don't even know if I could do it if it was a mandatory thing like needing to drive to get to work on my own. The way I handle this is by planning my life from work to school to living around areas with good public transportation. This means less suburbs and more apartment life near local hot spots or more city based areas. It means I'll have to move but if that's all that I have to do it's worth it for my mental health in the long run.</TEXT>

Think of saying that similar to telling someone with depression to just go outside, that's not how it works and saying that in a way trivializes the experience.

    <TEXT>I think I'm leaning towards ESH for the argument. First thing first the game thing was kinda shitty you're definitely the asshole there. Moving things around in the inventory or making phallic structures are funny because at their core they're just trivial pranks. Doing those things is an inconvenience at most and easy to laugh about as they're easy to fix or ignore. Changing the difficulty of the boss without notification is completely different as it changes elements that aren't easy to respond to and makes the "prank" feel less of a funny inconvenience and more like malicious intent. But that's a separate issue. The issue here is the argument and that's why I lean towards ESH. If you talked about it with your friend and reached an understanding then that should have been it. No one should be able to bring up prior grievances if they were already settled. Your friends an asshole for ranting about something you thought wasn't an issue anymore. That being said you are an asshole for the way you snapped. I don't necessarily blame you for getting angry about the situation being brought up again but you just flipped the script and did the exact same thing by bringing up his past mental breakdowns and venting and I guess also just being his friend? Did he even know those were issues you had or had those things been settled in the past as well and you found fit to bring them up so you could have a bigger high horse? It just feels very hypocritical. Add on to that that you guilted him by bringing up your dying family member situation as if that stops someone from being shitty or absolves the problem any because you're dealing with bigger things is really gaslighty. I just think the situation could have been handled better. Honestly best advice here is to take a step back, introspect before snapping and recognize that you're too stressed to handle a conversation like this civilly. Straight up say "You know I'm dealing with a lot right now with the situation with my family member and want to just play this game as an escape. I'd love to talk about this issue with you later but at this time i don't think I could have this discussion without it being blown out of proportion". If they don't accept that kind of response they're not a great or understanding friend in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gonna be the unpopular opinion on this one and say YWBTA. Your dad sucks full stop but you also have to understand that your brothers relationship with him is not the same as yours. You're essentially taking away something of great importance from him that you yourself have claimed isn't necessary to do. Living from paycheck to paycheck sucks, I'm currently doing it so I completely understand the want to not have to struggle, but taking away the car from your brother seems like trying to erase your father from his life. You have to accept that his relationship with his dad is different and getting rid of the only heirloom he has from him (whether it's extremely dipped in misogyny or not) is in fact bad. When he gets older and maybe understands more about what you had to experience maybe he'll feel differently but currently doing this is going to hurt. If I were him this would greatly change my relationship with you guys and it might make him more believing of his dad's take on the situation/his dad's ideals than yours. If it could be explained how much the money would help in a way he understands maybe he'll feel better about it being sold. But at the center of it, you're taking away something from him he already thinks of as his personal possession as well as a very important aspect of his relationship/memory with his father and it's kind of a betrayal when taken that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course! I think mine was mainly environmental? Like because of learned experiences of bad social situations (I pinpoint girl scouts and asking for money as peak examples) I started to develop anxiety in any situation that I deemed similar and as I grew those "similarities" became broad enough to include almost all of social situations. Like if I look into the reasoning behind being anxious it really equates to a fear of disturbing someone's time or disappointing someone which I think can be directly drawn to feeling like a disappointment for not selling enough cookies and disturbing someones peace by asking them to buy some. Nothing against girl scouts but boy howdy was that not a good time for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is understandable true. But residential pools should be fenced in. It's like making child safe decisions in your house, a defense measure that hopefully won't be needed but should be installed anyway. This is why I stated that I didn't blame the hotel because hotels shouldn't be responsible for parents not looking after their kids in this kind of situation but think of an at home situation. A lot of people have pools in their backyards not fenced in and yet kids play around those pools, covered or not that's a real safety issue and parents aren't as diligent as they'd like to think they are. If you're able to afford the kids and the pool you should be able to afford the safety needed. Besides knowing how to swim does not stop drowning from occurring. Say the kid hit their head going down from falling off their scooter and passes out, knowing how to swim wouldn't help in that situation but a fence installed would have prevented that from occuring. What if they have a medical situation and are unable to get out or use their arms or legs? What if they get tangeled in something like a pool cover or something they were playing with like a jump rope? Or what if they know how and still drown! More than half of drowning cases are of people who know how to swim anyhow. It's just a safety thing. And keep in mind this is a pool not a lake or canal (no one is saying everything has to be fenced in) it's also one that has kids playing around it. Does your country not put up a fence on the side of the playground nearest to the road so kids don't walk into traffic? Because it's the exact same idea. Again I don't think the hotel is at fault as the kids shouldn't have been allowed to play around the pool but in a residential or play area fences should be expected (also they're not that expensive to set up).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's some advice that has helped me (someone who gets panic attacks and sobs every time I drive because my social anxiety acts up). I don't yet have my license because I can never work up the nerve to take it (direct social interaction AND driving? my worst nightmare) but I drive a lot with my permit because of my dad's hospital visits. YOU and YOUR comfort is the MOST important aspect as long as it's safe. That means if you want to wait until you get a light to turn right do so no matter if people honk or are irritated. If parallel parking freaks you out you never have to do it again, go ahead and pay for parking garages and things and you'll feel better. If parking makes you anxious go ahead and pull through or park away from people. If you don't really know who should be going at a four way stop go ahead and wave some people on until you're comfortable. And I know it makes you an asshole to other drivers but if you truly are having trouble seeing go ahead and put your brights on, they're there to help. The test is aptitude not a representation of how you have to drive. Once you get through that you can avoid all the situations that make you uncomfortable as possible and you'll automatically feel better about driving.</TEXT>

And when I ultimately fail at that upkeep it becomes hours of brushing it out in pain and a greasy mess. I personally don't think I could ever do a big chop. I cry every time I get my hair done. But I think that sometimes the healthier decision both for your mental health and physical would be to cut it. Less of an upkeep, easier to wash, and because it's something new it will give you something to focus on for a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Special interests tend to be more personal in my experience. Like it's something that causes extreme feelings of happiness and enthusiasm and also is deeply emotional. Like if someone insulted a special interest that would feel as if they were insulting you because it's that special to you. They also last a long time. Hyperfixations tend to be more interest based in that they are attention focused and less emotional. It does tend to be something that comes and goes and can also be something you don't even enjoy. You can hyperfixate on cleaning even if you hate cleaning. Hyperfixations can also go hand in hand with special interests with you hyperfixating on specific elements of the interest. So for me (for example) TMNT is a special interest. I get very emotional over opinions on it and can talk for days about the topic. It's also an interest that hasn't gone away in 22 years. But a few years ago I was obsessed with this one specific villain from TMNT and I researched and drew them all the time. That obsession has passed (I still like them) but the special interest still remains. This is at least my take on it. It'll be interesting how everyone describes this!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA for telling your mom your opinion, you are kind of an jerk for your thinking though. You sound entitled. Fun fact about PS4s and other gaming systems is that they're movable. Not as easy as the game cube but you can just bring them over if you really want to play them together. It's a sleepover not a day trip and you're there for your friend not his house or the city. There is probably a ton of fun to be had specific to his area but you just won't give it a chance. From someone who had a smaller house I always felt bad hanging out at others all the time. Not only did it highlight how much less I had compared to them it also made it seem like they didn't really want to spend time with me. I loved my home and wanted to share it with them as they had done for me. If the only reason you aren't hanging out at his house with him is because he doesn't have as cool of things or as big of house then do you really care about your friend or his stuff?</TEXT>

You waited until you were ready and you'll have a much better time of it for doing so. If you really want the second kid I'd say go for it. Don't stop yourself from living life and enjoying all of the moments you'll be there for by thinking of the moments you'll theoretically miss. Edit: NTA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ESH. You for reacting so strongly to what seems to just be a threat without any follow through at the moment. If he actually went and got legal action then I understand your ire but the threat in an argument just doesn't have the same stature. He though is also an asshole. Fun fact everyone it's super ableist to not include the person with a disability in anything that deals with their person/disability. They don't need you to make decisions for them or to tell others how they feel, they can do that on their own. Certainly stand up for them when you can but don't try to speak for them because all that ends up happening is you drowning them out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally get where you're coming from but totally also see the other side. People saying that are comparing themselves to something whether that be a person or some sort of weird ideal. It's a personal thing of insecurity and during that they aren't thinking of you. Most people who are like wow my nose is huge wish it was smaller mean it personally for themselves not for their maybe friend with a big nose as well. Not saying your feelings aren't valid, people really should think about other people, but when people are putting themselves down by comparing themselves to others they never mean to compare you as well and probably don't even think of the effect it could have on you. Have you tried telling people not to say things like that near you because it feels like a slight?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tabi socks?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>So I have always loved tabi socks. They make my feet look like ninja turtle feet and it makes me goofy with joy when I wear them. I bought my dad a pair when I visited Japan in 2016 and he also fell in love with them but for different reasons of course. Apparently they are great for diabetics losing feeling in their feet, it allows him to wear flip flops around without flinging them everywhere. The problem is that another symptom of diabetics is chills/cold feet and all the tabi socks I own are regular thin ones. Do they make thick tabi socks and if so where do I find them? I'd like to get him a pair for Christmas this year and would be open to online shopping or shopping through a surrogate in Japan or anything at this moment. Thanks!</TEXT>

If you have multiple bruises in one place that would be suspicious as well as they tend to be big in one area not multiple ones in an area. Bruises tend to be over some sort of bone as it creates that between a rock and a hard place blood vessel crushing reaction to your body, meaty areas have less of that reaction because they are more protected.</TEXT>

I'm not going to say psychopathic or anything like that because I'm not qualified to do so but the excuse of animals not being good or useless is just an excuse you're using to be out right cruel. Moths scare the heck out of me, I have a phobia of them, but still if possible I let them out safely rather than killing them and even when I do kill them it is as quick as possible. Long drawn out deaths whether that animal can truly understand what's going on is needlessly cruel and it's kinda scary you enjoyed watching it happen. The steps it took to deliberately wait for hot water to boil it to death is scary. You need to see someone about this. You're showing symptoms of severe harm OCD or at the very least worrisome violent thoughts and actions.</TEXT>

I will say that I hate when people fight other people's fights for them. Like I may not be that strong but I can cut someone down with words enough that they back off. I don't need someone to step in front of me. Also I agree stepping IN FRONT of you does kind of (not even in a masculinity kind of way) suggest weakness, why not stand beside you? Face the threat together not one over the other. Though I will say that while he was directing those comments toward you they were cutting down her as well implying she was a damsel in need of saving, your defense would have been saying essentially the same thing she did but with your voice. Proving him wrong/right is dumb though. Ignore that trash and move on. Stop lying to yourself and realize that you are insecure over this especially if proving random strangers wrong about it is high on your list. She's wrong though to try to dictate your feelings on the matter. You're insecure and there are ways to work on that but just saying not to feel that way doesn't help anyone. NAH for having feelings but man just accept that you don't need to be her protector, it's toxic to need that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah yes my time has come. I actually am really drawn to April owning her grandfather's or father's antique shop. I think it just has many an opportunity for story lines from things found in the shop to the shop itself that I'm really quite disappointed more TMNT iterations don't play with it. April also should be an adult. I HATE aging down characters for better representation or to make them more relatable. If you want a female teen character make a new one and older women are as relatable as teens even more so sometimes. I love adult April because then you get mother figure or only female figure in their life story lines and I think those are super important. I like Casey having some sort of beef with the Purple Dragons. I think the gang drama works much better to be his focus with the turtles helping than the other way around. Love Mikey and Don's relationship in the 1990 movie. Perfect middle sibling energy. Honestly a lot of Raph and Leo fighting moments just make me roll my eyes. They never seem to have a real reason behind the argument other than Raph doesn't like Leo being the leader because?????? like the beef most of the time isn't explained. I get the 2007 movie version because Leo stayed away and left them but most of the time I'm just bored of it. Let other brother relationships shine (Raph and Don please or Don and Mikey, heck give me more individual son moments with Splinter!). I do like the idea though of Raph being the eldest and Leo being next in line but being chosen as the leader. It gives a real reason for the arguments and resentment and also opens up the possibility for both of them to learn more about each other and grow (but this will probably just stay a fantasy). I hate mutations. Like 2012 is horrid because almost every character gets mutated by the end! There is no reason for this. It's actually a much more interesting story if the turtles main enemies and conflicts come from humans and humanity issues rather than mutants. I think it opens up the door to better exploration of their feelings of being outcasts stuck with only each other for most of their lives. Like give me characters like Bishop! Um other ones are I like the turtles to be older teens rather than younger. Like 18 for most of them with the youngest being 16. Also while I want them to be goofy and teenagers, they aren't children, they've dealt with being hidden and hunted for all of their lives so I like when they are more mature than you'd think for the age. Donnie is smart and a genius in engineering but hes not a stuck up know it all nor an expert in every science to exist. He builds things he doesn't create new elements. I like black April! I'm a fan of classic origin story for the turtles too.</TEXT>

Also sad to say it but if need be cut him out of your life. Sit them down and say this has nothing to do with religion this has to do with respect and if he can't respect you then block him from everything and don't interact.

    <TEXT>It's not that long. A lot of people also use tons of hair products so it's longer. Or they actually leave their conditioner on for 5 minutes before washing out. I have hair past my butt and if I was truly just washing it shampoo and then my leave in conditioner it does not take that long at all. It's also helpful though to have one of those shower wands because if not you have to hold your hair up to clean through it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Multiple things to note. 1. Go so your campus councilor. They cannot prescribe you medicine but you'd be surprised how helpful it can be just having someone to talk to. It's also fairly likely they have a group meeting for people struggling with similar things as you are which can help a lot too. Also the doctors they recommend could be easier to deal with than trying to find your one on your own. 2. Vyvanse is the name brand of a ADHD medication meaning it's more expensive than others and is only covered by some insurances. You should look into generic medications that cost around $100 instead especially if you're not on insurance.</TEXT>

It's also a matching tattoo that isn't a name (which I love btw) so without the context it's just an avocado tattoo to anyone else. YTA for asking her to change a part of her body to please you.

You shouldn't have to be dropping jobs and classes because she can't trust you over one decision you've made not in this relationship. Keep your job in the field that you want and if she can't be happy with that then she's too insecure to be in a adult relationship, it's about trust.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Inpatient Care Whilst in College...?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-22 02:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a long winded explanation of a situation so for some here's this: TL;DR: I'm experiencing what I think is psychosis and wondering if inpatient is a good option and if it is how do I go about getting there. So to start off my mental situation has gotten worse. A lot worse let's say. I am completely covered in 2nd degree and first degree burns and cuts from self harm at this point. Nothing too deep cut wise but just littered in them from feet to chest. The only place I haven't done is my neck and face though I think about it daily. For the first time in a long time I self harmed on campus. I monitor for the wood studio on campus and I constantly walked around this last Sunday looking for tools to hurt myself. I even tried to burn myself while making food today! I can't get myself to do anything at all so I'm falling behind in my classes and yet can't bring myself to really care. I have a breakdown (vomiting and panicking and passing out) thinking about going to most of my classes and I'm honestly thinking about skipping them this week so as not to throw up again. My problems with hygiene and hunger have gotten worse and I've started having actual real thoughts about slitting my throat (not that I'd actually do it because death causes me too much anxiety). So yeah, bad. And being home isn't making it better. My dad is undergoing treatment for cancer so my mother and her mother have come to stay to help out and get the house ready for moving. This means that 2 people who outrageously stress me out and make me feel lesser are making my safe place not safe as well as having everything around me changing so much I just don't know how to handle it. I'm self harming, disassociating, crying, and freaking out at least once a day so much so I feel like I'm falling into psychosis. I think I need help. Currently I see a psychiatrist (2 visits over 3 months with her and I don't think we really click) with my next meeting with her this upcoming Monday. She knows I self harm and worries about it enough she gave me her cell to call if I felt like I needed more help(which makes me anxious to think to do). She also knows I've been having a tough time at it but most of everything going on now has been a new or escalated development since our last meeting so she's a bit out of the loop for my current mental state. I was thinking about doing an inpatient stay. To one forcibly get out of this situation and have some time to learn to handle everything going on and two get more consistent reoccurring help for a while. I'm not even on any medications or therapies for everything that's happening. The problem is I don't know if this is the right response? Like, I don't really think I'm a threat to myself I don't really think I'll try to commit suicide so should I even go? And if I do how do I go about it? Should I call/text her what's happening now or should I wait till my appointment Monday to talk to her? How would this all effect my classes? Will this count against me? I just feel like I'm at rock bottom and digging myself even further the long I go. Just need some thoughts on what I should do. Thoughts encouragements, experiences, and ideas very very welcome. Thanks! (Just read the rules, I'm from the US Midwest)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess it the thought was due to having a few visual hallucinations and all of the cognitive experiences for it but looking at the definition and stuff now for it I can see that I probably don't fit it. I feel like when you feel bad you try to see yourself as feeling the worst that you can imagine, maybe this is what I have been doing in that regard. Thanks for the kind words, especially the bit about what it would mean to be stable for me. While the stability might not be achievable on my own or without medication my idea of the stability can be defined now and then I have sort of a plan for my mental health journey.</TEXT>

We have haven't been shut down or sent home yet but I'm watching as our weekly counter of positive cases increase from 1 to this week's 30+. Our school continues to send out little propaganda videos of our mascot social distancing as if that will help. The whole graphic design department of my school is quarantining. It's terrifying as I have a dad currently going through cancer treatment at an increased risk.

    <TEXT>This is a classic example of people not understanding the difference between a fear and a phobia. I'm afraid of or have a FEAR of most spiders. I find their movement very unsettling and would rather not see one. If I do see one though I can take action by killing it or catching it and letting it out or ignoring it until I can't see it anymore. I can hold and pet a tarantula fine. I have a PHOBIA of moths. I pass out if one touches me. I avoid lights at night and won't leave my porch light on for the same reason. I'll walk home in the dark. I get very panicky when I see one, have extreme panic attacks when near one or when one is trapped in a space with me. I'll avoid whole rooms if I saw a moth in there and won't enter them no matter what if I haven't seen evidence it's been caught or killed. I'll then be unsettled and jumpy for days afterwards from the experience. It's a phobia, it comes intense reactions to the stimulus that I can't control. Phobias are not jokes and shouldn't be taken lightly but sadly most people don't seem to understand that. NTA OP. You don't want to be attached to someone who would weaponize your phobia as the other redditor rightly pointed out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does she have nice tools or is she using that speedball cutter with the extra heads inside? These tools are fairly cheap but cut lino easier and can cut wood too, they're also easy to sharpen! https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001T8IEO6/ref=cm_cr_othr_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8#cm_cr_carousel_images_section If she already has tools I'd recommend a wetstone or strop for sharpening her cutters. Can find some cheap good one for around 20-30 online or in person at any craft or wood store. And then a little extra one if she's already all equipped! A hand vacuum for the desk. It's so nice to just vacuum up all the little bits you carve out and you can also vacuum them from the block itself. Not a need for getting into the hobby but just a fun add on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with the other redditor. It's about understanding and respecting a culture and their practices or not doing so. A good example of cultural appropriation is headdresses and how in plains Indian culture it's a highly respected item that is earned by someone that earned a place of respect but how many people wear them as a fashion statement or as generic "Indian" outfits. That's wrong because not only are you generalizing tons of culturally different tribes into this carivurture amalgamation of their cultures but you are also degrading the meaning surrounding the article. For me cultural appropriation is easy to spot if it's: 1. something that is still negatively affecting the community (an example of this is how black hairstyles are a fashion trend for white people and yet when black people wear them they are discriminated against) 2. something that was harmed or shamed by colonists (Polynesian tattoo artists were tortured and killed over their tattooing by westerners and many elements from their cultural history are gone due to this so getting a Polynesian tattoo now without proper understanding or acceptance of the symbolism and culture behind it is actively playing into the erasure of their culture and putting you on pare with those of the past) 3. or if the borrowed aspect of the culture is used in a way to perpetuate a stereotype of said culture (an example of this is "war paint" of handprints on the face and then acting out of control and blood thirsty) Generally anything done without real knowledge of all the important bits. This is dressing up in sugar skulls without knowing what sugar skulls are created. It's hard to differentiate sometimes but I think I've mostly got it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well that's where you're wrong because it can be caused by outside factors. Those factors cause stress that can trigger your brain chemistry to change and get a mood disorder like MDD. It's a combination of stress and genes and other factors and looks different for everyone. It's not your job to call out what you perceive as a "faker," please keep uninformed comments to yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This! If work doesn't get done they'll figure out who isn't cutting it and react accordingly. If OP doesn't want to say anything then they don't have to but they shouldn't be working themselves dry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg my family has started to do the same thing. I'm fine saying oh call me by nickname if I know them well or if they're young but I should be introduced with my name because that's who I am! I hate being known by others for a name that isn't actually mine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I agree with liking the half colored more than the white. The only thing is having the colored part of the show be black makes it blend into the background too much, maybe make it just like a charcoal grey so you keep the darkness without losing the shoe!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA. Gonna be honest here and say HW does not matter more than your mental well being. Sure do it and try to get good grades but don't stress yourself out over it and don't put it before handling your grief. You lost a pet and that's a huge emotional weight. You have to handle that before you are able to focus.</TEXT>
