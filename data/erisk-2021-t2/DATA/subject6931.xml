    <TITLE>'Vanguard of Ystra' (first timer)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-17 23:11:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>First time creating anything with pixel art and my first post on Reddit ever! :D Anyway, I am open for suggestions since I hope to learn not only by observing but by direct input as well. I got inspired by the very recently released game ''Death's Gambit''. The completely black character is my first outline where I didn't think too much about color and paterns yet. The middle character is where I experimented with the armor and helm. Finally, I got my colors ready and shaded as much as I dared. Again I am very much open for feedback and suggestions! This is the 'Vanguard of Ystra' by me. https://preview.redd.it/901jz583kqg11.png?width=916 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=c15bddabbae7f1e68d937c2f38a764d9f30e3ad6</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just wanted to say that I love the way you made the shield's shadowing feel so dynamic. the cape is great as well! The background seemed saturated, but with the shield kind of melting into that same color you nailed it! I myself just began with this, so I have no clue as to what you could effectively do to make it better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those houses/cabins look great! I really like the slight weathering on both the logs and the roofs. The character is awesome as well! The grass might be a tad too much but if you just change some of the grass-pixels to a darker color you might get less saturation over the whole!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another thought I had was if you work with tiles, leave the edges clear of bright grass pixels, just leave it a base-color grean, that way the repetitive nature might be less obvious. I am sure you already tried this, but I thought I'd share my idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off I saw your other work and you are getting better and better :D. I like how all the weapons have an aura around them. However, in my opinion, the shadow on the ground is really distracting. Quite frankly I think a disembodied/floating sword doesn't need a shadow when it is stabing the void around it... Of course this is your artistic choice and I am just giving my opion. Second, is it intentional that the dagger/sword is a bit wonky or is that a tiny fault in the sprite? Again this might be your artistic choice that I am not aware of. Thirdly, In what way would you like your animation cleaner? Smoother, more frames, or faster and more special effects?  #8203; Let me know and keep up the good work!  #8203;</TEXT>

For me it is legs and feet, for you it apparently is face (and hair) and hands. the hands can be ignored. The face is 'not optimal' yet. I found a few things you could use to improve it:  #8203; Dont directly copy it, just use it as inspiration: you will learn a lot more than just copying. Same applies to videos that I recommend you watch. (you'll have to adapt the style to fit into your existing art but still) I dont have much more to show for, so good luck out there and don't give up on pixeling because 90% of Garen is AMAZING!!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Core Set 2019 predetermined or random?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-23 21:41:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>But really I am thinking (pretty much convinced and ready to take out my already broke wallet) of starting with MTG I got the Black v. Red free deck So when I went to my local gaming sore and saw this box: https://preview.redd.it/3ylnxgl0vzh11.png?width=233 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=c7c7fb0afe71f8942c805569e1905b456340eebb I thought to myself it was something like a standard box to start playing. After many comments I finally understood that 'Core Set 2019' is not the right way to refer to this. I understand that the *box* contains *36* boosters which in turn contains 15 random cards that differ in rarity...  #8203; So back to my initial question: I meant to ask' are the content of the boosters found in this box (picture above) random or predetermined? With pre-determined I meant that the creators of the game had made a box in which you found 30+ cards to play with any color.  #8203; HOWEVER, I also understand now that you are not locked into a certain color and that colors are no hard factions... they can mix and match.  #8203; I understand a lot more about the way boosters are handled now and I am certainly picking one of the boxes deficted above up at my local gaming store. Thanks for all the replies,  #8203; your friendly local noob, WK  #8203; EDIT: I noticed that there were a lot of down votes and some people seemed confused about what I was asking. I figured I shoudl give my initial question a revisit and some background info.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! I am definitely getting at least one set. I'm not trying to get ahead of myself but what would the next logical step be? Also to get this clear: the Core Set 2019 is a box with X number of booster packs? (I get that the number of packs aren't randomised, but I don't know the real number; therefore the X)  #8203; EDIT: If I have 1 Core Set 2019, is that enough to make 2 decks? (one for me and one for the oposing player)?</TEXT>

I find myself staring at the screen not knowing what to do with this piece since I have never done a landscape, a grim/dark piece and not much pixel art in general... It is my goal to make this such a ''WOW'' piece of art, but at the moment it feels meh and looks bland... I feel like I have an ideal in my head which I cant even clearly visualise in my thoughts... So turning it to art is even harder. The tower is a bit wonky, the tree and it's shadow are weird and to be honest (now that I take a look at it) I think the tree is too red-brown... Some concrete help is welcome and therefore I have provided the 100% no-zoom-in version of the work as well. I am aware of my poor pillow shading...  #8203; Thanks for reading this wall of text and thanks in advance for the help.  #8203; WK</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as far as the coloring and the stance goes, it was my intention to make them static and simple, but I think I will make them both a bit more energetic. Your ideas for Thanos are good! I will try to make him bend a knee as well or jump like he does in the movie (when he fires the blast of infinity stone-stuff to the doctor)  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is the next big Indie Pixelart game?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-27 22:52:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I got Death's Gambit and Dead Cells and Hollow Knight (which is not pixel art, but I want you to understand the type of games im talking about). However I was late to get on the hypetrain... Now I want to see a new game rise and see it develop and feel hype for it... So does anyone know of a fairly new (unreleased) game that will most certainly make heads turn? Just spit out ideas for me to keep track of! I am excluding Blasphemous and Eitr because I am already keeping my eye on them... I post it hear, because I am specifically looking for Pixel art style games, and a lot of the artists here are making sprites and assets for games... So yeah, let me know! :D</TEXT>

I had never heard of it but the trailer gave me a strong Hyper Light Drifter vibe... It seems to take the music (maybe a bit), a bit of the palette and the Giant Creature Remains of HLD. Of course it is not all copy and paste: there is more than 1 character, the setting is quite different and I like the looks of it... [Announcement Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuw66XndfOk)  #8203; This announcement trailer (which is also the source of all my inspiration for this post) was posted 2 years ago... apparently this was also coming to switch but I have nothing seen from 2018. Anyway let me know if you knew this existed and if it excites you! I would like to hear!  #8203; PS. I do not own any of the footage shown in the image or link above 'Glitch Factory' does. PPS. I do not work for the company behind the game, 'Glitch Factory' to promote this. PPPS. I know I could also post this in r/indiegames or something, but it is much more likely that people already heard about it over there, that's why I asked my favorite sub instead (which is obviously r/PixelArt</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The site looks good, once its been loaded... but wow, it took a long time to load that page. Did you compress your images? The images were the real problem, it was as of I was back at Windows XP with Internet Explorer. Anyway the point is, try to minify your images, I am sure it will work fine on a pc with decent wifi but on a phone with medium wifi it takes painfully long. That will cost you clicks and potential clients. I suggest going over to www.tinypng.con and conpressing your images without losing their quality (do keep the original of course). It will make your site load faster and more userfriendly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great page! I checked it out on mobile (OnePlus 6t, for size references) A few things that stood out: 1) The red wavy things (which I think are part of your style) immediatly reminded me of the "incorrect spelling wave" in Microsoft Word. It might just be me but I somehow was triggered to look if everything was spelled correctly. 2) Your footer is kind of janky with 3 colums stacked on top of each other, perhaps try 2 colums next to each other (might also reduce the lengthy scroll) 3) I am not sure if I am correct on this, but not everything seems to follow the same margin/padding. Might just be a feeling (but a bad feeling is all a customer needs to leave your page). 4) It is a long long scroll, especially on mobile. EDIT: You can ignore part 4, I see you have placed get started buttons every few paragraphs so that quick and slow buyers can take their time alike, which I see as great design PS. Awesome design overall, must have been done by a good professional.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason for this is simple. Pewds knows he loved Joergen, so he gave him a well-meant send of with some of the more expensive things he owned. It doesnt need to be enormous because he actually loved the horse. Watersheep though, was killed on accident, which left pewds ashamed and full of guilt. And now he is trying to make up for this feeling by overcompensating and presenting grant buildings for Jeb_. He tries to 'buy' hinself out of his regret of killing the sheep before he told him he loved it. TL;DR Pewds loved horse, horse gets simple sendoff. Pewds kills sheep and overcompensates to not feel guilty.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Steam Sale during EVO?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-31 00:17:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there! I have been looking into fighting games lately and decided that I wanted to pick up on them. Rookie mistake to hope I'll be any good, but hey, I didn't earn my black belt irl without training either. Anyway, I dont really want to spend too too much money on games (I blame my nationality (dutch)), so I was hoping there would be a sale on fighters (specifically on steam) during EVO next weekend? I'll be picking one up anyway, but a discount is always welcome ofcourse ;). Cheers! TL;DR Will steam have a sale on fighting games during next EVO?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been doing that, and I am thinking of picking up Street Fighter V. People say it's a trash game and that it is dumbed down, but I like the style and if it is really "dumbed down" it might be a decent first game. But convince me otherwise if you think that is a bad idea. (SFV is now free untill 11Aug which sucks because I won't be at home. I would have prefered a discount...) EDIT: I shouldn't complain, but for me this is literally useless right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IT and tech is your specialization but the first thing I read (title/nav) doesn't back that up. You use a "serif" font (look it up,I don't know how to explain it properly in English), which gives me the feeling of an old news paper in stead of a fast and reliable news site about the latest tech. To get this feel use a "sans-serif" font. I recommend the font called Roboto (widely used and sans-serif) or a websafe font like Arial or Verdana). You do use a sans-serif font in the article blocks though so good job there. However, black text on grey background doesn't provide enough contrast to read nicely. Either try black-white, black-verylightgrey or white on black if you want a dark themed webpage. Which leads to the following, the page overall is very dark, which can work fine, but yours doesn't. You lack contrast. A clear call-to-action (CTA) is missing. Turn the read-more into a button with darker blue as background and a bold white text. One more point regarding the content itself: Every article block has 2 titles, which makes the site messier, longer and users will turn away if they can't skim through the interesting stuff because they have to read everything twice. I don't know how your script handles that (or if it is done manualy), but that should be fixed. Happy Designing, subject6931 PS. I just tried your search button, and the placeholder text "Search this blog" as well as the search button are dark grey on a black/blue background. I would make the grey a good bit darker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That explains the long loading time. With size i meant both MB/KB and dimensions (they are somewhat linked). So if your image is used 2 times, just upload 2 seperate sized images. Resizing 1 image might seem "economic" but it will butcher the quality when stretched to far out or in. Glad I could help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Few things I would change: - Your font is quite all and thin on mobile, I would suggest increasing the size or bolden it (I would prefer bigger letters, bold will cause problems with the feel of your site) - Almost all of your images have abysmall quality. Either find better quality versions or replace them. In this age of the internet it is all about loadingtime and "bounce"-rates (the amount of people that left or stayed on your page). Low-rez pictures make people feel your site is either 1) slow 2)low quality. HOW TO SOLVE: - Bigger font, perhaps play with different typefaces and spacing between lines, words and letters. - Higher quality pictures  gt; compress them to keep loading time at a minimum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, I promised u/parker200410 to post the blueprint of my shuttle. I haven't figured out the best way to post these yet, but here you go anyway. Some footnotes: \- The shuttle has to be launched with an external rocket, pretty easy to build, however in F2P version I suggest building the shuttle to the farthest left and as far down possible to give you all the space you need \- The shuttle with cargo will tilt to the left, either use the engines or RCS to keep it straight. \- Kit out the cargobay as you prefer for your cargo, you can leave it loose but deployment and fasttravel might be messy. \- I have no details on how much weight the shuttle can hold, but the cargobay I have provided you with is of a decent size. You can always add more fairing space. \- When deploying make sure to be 'upside' down (relative to your screen)  gt; tap the seperators on the cargobay  gt; tap the fairing. This way you will have a short window to get the payload out before the fairing swings shut by itself. (Of course you can just deploy how you like, but the door will float away and you will have to catch it). Have fun!  #8203; PS. I have another video on my account that shows me deploying a satelite in moon orbit in the way I described above (check it out if it wasn't clear) EDIT: I just found out that the shuttle without any cargo can get into LEO on its own, however It wont get much higher that an average of 60 km. haven't tested with cargo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a video on my account that shows my shuttle deploying a satelite using a fairing-bay, if you want you can look that up. The trick is that a fairing will stay in place (not shoot out into space) if you place anything directly underneath it. So if you do that on one half and not on the other part, it will function as a box. Now if you add a connector to the opening-half you can reuse it and close your box again. EDIT: can all be done in No-dlc :D, Your bay will be quite shallow however so if you need to transport big pieces either do that in parts or use your method.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, sorry for the late reply, the trick is to release your cargo when you are upside down (relative to your screen) the door should swing shut automatically. Dont ask me how or why but that is how the game works. (Also tap the fairing first, then decouple the door) Anyway, was the build usefull? What did you launch so far? Edit: with 'catching', I meant trying to chase the tophalf of the fairing using RCS after you launch it away from yourself. It is a tedious thing and getting the two halves to connect again is a pain. Please just follow my instructions above to keep yourself from pain and misery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't really tell you if your message comes across. However the checkmark in the green circle is alligned with the bottom of the card: it is horizontal, this breaks the balance because the rest of the text is skewed and rotated. I don't really know why the checkmark is even there, because I don't feel it adds anything and it just disgracts from your card. EDIT: Also while you have great whitespace (the breathingroom for your main logo) you could fill that right-under corner with some medium grey socialmedia handle, not too big but it will be good for your main target audience, teens/young adults. EDIT 2: Also I am not sure what your company does and why your target audience should feel this way with you, what do you do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! I am applying for an insternship webdesigner/developer this week for coming february. Therefore I am building/reworking my portfolio. The site is https://wouter-kool.nl I mainly focus on my webdeveloper side more than webdesign. I am working on producing more content. Any and every critique is welcome, I can handle it. Thanks a ton in advance! PS. Since it is a portfolio (which I need to have done on short notice) I opted to go for desktop first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a developer I would agree, however my designer side still thinks a innovative idea/design is worth more even if it is a hassle. However in order for it to be worth the hassle you need to polish it to great lengths, thats why I'm glad you are thinking along!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Firstly, thanks for taking the time to write this up. Secondly allow me to expand upon my ideas. You are completely right about not hiring pc-first devs, however I stated above that I am in a bit of a rush and therefore opted to go for a larger canvas so to speak. This is in fact my first time animating, which indeed might not be the best move for something that sells me as a person/service. However I think the basic "boring" animation at least makes the minimalist design feel more dynamic. (which believe it or not was the goal) I am not sure about the transition both ways, but I think you are right about that. Mastering modern webdesign would be a great leap for me, since I am still a student. This is my way of introducing me to a potential internship. I am not really out there yet. Once I am I will probably have changed this site already. Thanks for your input, I hope we understand eachother  #128512; #128077;</TEXT>

However I have noticed that Javascript isn't really optimal in my situation and so I stumbled upon C++ while searching for an alternative. I was wondering if learning C++ is worth it for short and long term programming. Keep in mind I only know scripting languages like JavaScript (ES6) and Python. Hope some of you can steer me in the right direction. TL;DR is learning c++ worth it for long term RL projects?

    <TITLE>[HELP] HTML5 pseudo-raycasting without canvas</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-19 14:37:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi fellow roguelikedevs, I am going to ask you for help with a particular problem I am having while developing my very first RL. BACKSTORY: I have started making a roguelike in HTML5 and JavaScript, since that is the only thing I know how to do well. The roguelike is not very fleshed out yet and so far I have random dungeon generation, movement of the character and the spawning of enemies. The next step is the enemy AI. So that is what I am working on and where I am stuck at. Since I am not using canvas but regular HTML elements (don't ask why, it works so far), however for the enemies/monsters to detect anything, they have to look around. I decided I want them to look in 8 directions every turn and decide what way to go based on a few factors like fear/aggression towards players and thirst and hunger. To apply KISS, i just have them move when they the player for now.  #8203; [The pseudo-rays in question](https://preview.redd.it/f3jkjsbyvqb41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=177eb7add4cc64b491f4da6e0c1d80890d55503f) The way they check their surrounding tiles now is by checking if 8 very thin divs overlap with the surrounding tiles. If the divs (pseudo-rays) do overlap, they check if the player is on it. Simple enough right? Yes for the horizontal and vertical 'rays', it was very easy and it works like sunshine. But I can't figure out how to correctly check for overlap when the div is diagonal. The code used for the northern line is:  gt;// if n\_ray's X is more than Cell's X + Cell's width  amp; amp;  gt;  gt;// if n\_ray's X is less than Cell's X  amp; amp;  gt;  gt;// if n\_ray's Y is more than Cell's Y + Cell's height  amp; amp;  gt;  gt;// if n\_ray's Y is more than Cell's Y + Cell's width  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt;if( n\_ray.getBoundingClientRect().x  lt; (cellRect.x + cellRect.width)  amp; amp;  gt;  gt;n\_ray.getBoundingClientRect().x  gt; cellRect.x  amp; amp;  gt;  gt;n\_ray.getBoundingClientRect().y  lt; (cellRect.y + cellRect.height)  amp; amp; (n\_ray.getBoundingClientRect().y + n\_ray.getBoundingClientRect().height)  gt; cellRect.y){  gt;  gt;//WHAT TO DO IF THEY DO IN FACT DETECT  gt;  gt;}  #8203; THE PROBLEM: How do I check for overlap using a horizontal div and a tablecell?  #8203; SIDE NOTE: I would also like to know if there is a way easier way I am missing to check the surrounding tiles? Perhaps I just do not see a much easier solution to this problem? I have refactored the entire thing many times already to apply KISS, and this part just seems unnessicarily hard.  #8203; TL;DR Pseudo-ray-divs at an angle of 45degrees are not reacting to my regular code, which does work for horizontal and vertical pseudo-rays.  #8203; Thank you in advance for the help and answers, I hope we can solve or improve this!  #8203; Wouter (Newbie RLDev)  #8203; PS: My current version can be found on [https://wouter-kool.nl/RL/](https://wouter-kool.nl/RL/) PPS: The game is still littered with loose ends and bugs, please don't roast haha PPPS: The green thing in the picture is the exit that takes you to a new level</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Merging overlapping rooms</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-21 14:28:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I have returned once again to ask for help. While I was restructuring the game to a more rigid basis, I abstracted the overlapping function incorrectly which led to all my rooms being allowed to overlap during generation. This turned out to be something I liked and even once I fixed the overlapping function I kept the procgen this way.  #8203; [Nice irregular shapes to form large open spaces](https://preview.redd.it/jofm57i165c41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=27234c01eba6df93902aedc2dd0ad6aba371f111) Anyway, now my corridors/tunnels are ruining the nice semi-natural feel that this creates and therefore I thought I would just make sure the game recognized when rooms overlapped and consider them 1 big room, however this is proving to be rather challenging. I have tried sorting the rooms that overlap into seperate arrays (merged\_rooms) however this is both slow and a headache to get right (BTW, I haven't even gotten this approach to work). I scoured the web for articles on overlapping rooms in RL and I even went to page 2 of google for this one, however everyone either seems to want to keep their rooms all nicely spread out like a traditional dungeon or resort to cellular automata for a cavern look. I am wondering if anyone else has tried this and succeeded (There must be) and/or anyone has some good articles on this kind of generation.  #8203; TL;DR I want to have my rooms overlap to get nice irregular rooms, but I want the tunnels that connect them to recognize to be as short and clean as possible. Any articles or experience is welcome!  #8203; Thanks! Wouter  #8203; PS. Typing up these questions really puts my problem into focus for myself, like talking to a rubberduckie ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this is basically what I had in mind for what I tried at first, I store all the generated room-objects in an array and then I check every room if it overlaps any - gt; if it does it puts all the overlapping rooms in a new array within that original room array, I didn't get it quite right and it keeps snowballing into making a few almost identical groups for every room it checks. Perhaps I should tell the script to skip the room if it is already in a group, however it could be possible that I then miss picking up rooms that should also be included...</TEXT>

It looks great however I am not using prefabs that are placed next to every wall, which means that the 'wall' can be up to 50 blocks wide, that would result in a pretty ugly hallway (which is exactly not what I want haha). I will however keep this method in mind though for future use. I might switch to prefabs once procgen finally kills me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello there fellow captain, Thanks for your reply! I have split the game logic and front-end since the original post and as you said the bigger the map  gt; more monsters  gt; considerably slower. I am seriously thinking of just switching to Canvas since that seems to be the only logical way this would work out. Since this post I have rebuilt the entire game to work from objects like game, map, player etc. Every function has been abstracted where possible so the base this time around is a lot more solid. I made some design changes to the map (now the rooms may overlap to allow for more interesting results) which is causing a slight head-ache while I try to figure out how to merge them and treat as a single room (You may have seen my thread about that on this sub as well). I will be a while before I get to FOV again since monsters don't spawn at all (nor can the player move around) but it is pretty interesting how you suggest that if the monster is in the player fov that the player must be in the monsters fov. However I want my monsters to display certain personalities like greed, fear and aggression to more than just the player. So skipping their fov won't be possinle for me. One last thing, you switched to canvas now, right? How smooth was the transition? What were some of the hiccups and is there anything that holds you back? Oh and also: was the change to canvas worth it? Thanks a ton already, Wouter</TEXT>

Also is calculating on canvas faster since its just a blob of visuals you project every frame/change?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-27 13:35:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, Hope you are all having a fresh start of the week. I decided to work on dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding, tunneling and more for my game. I had done FloodFill succesfully before so I understand the work flow of dijkstra's. Long story short and a few iterations later I end up with the algorithm semi-working. Let me show you what I mean with semi:  #8203; [Code Below ](https://preview.redd.it/uwjr1wl6pbd41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=44649bc3d87f890c647ab8a5f29d88e64b097c83)  #8203; [The code for pic above](https://preview.redd.it/sbkan239pbd41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=4ed73e19586bd865df1b625a658e8bed286274ee)  #8203; [Code below](https://preview.redd.it/xxx9l9hbpbd41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=1d67fbd4fcad01feda8e6b419693e64f3dabb029)  #8203; [Pic above](https://preview.redd.it/zfee843dpbd41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=2b106d686626cd051614ebe76a980e72a2e09381) I can also do this for the upper and lower half of the grid. One thing I noticed is how the opposite direction is always the second line. So if Up is the first line, then the second has to be turned off otherwise you end up with this monstrosity:  #8203; [It seems like the algorithm suddenly wants to move in lines rather than a diamond](https://preview.redd.it/963hiqhkpbd41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=d0e4bdc77fb8bbf09f699ba086eb7ad0e9f14b10)  #8203; [What the \*\*\*\* changed it's behaviour so radically?!](https://preview.redd.it/rum2978qpbd41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=930ebfb928dce1dca2be57885f5f1df23897adc1)  #8203; Perhaps I am missing something extremely obvious but it seems to me that the algorithm doesn't want to obey the rules of the very algorithm itself anymore. Can anyone spot my error? Also improvements to this rudimentary piece of code is also welcome as I will be using it more than once in the future.  #8203; TL;DR Recursion in dijkstra seems to get tangled except for when the second line (opposite site of grid) is turned off.  #8203; Thanks again for reading my complete noob question. Wouter  #8203; PS. Also thanks to everyone helping out on the last question, I learned a ton from everyone. That's why I am even building my first RL, to learn as much as possible. Thanks a ton! PPS. I forgot to mention that 999 is the unchanged value, I use it to check if the cell's been changed yet to avoid an infinite loop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All these algorithms are making my head hurt to be frank. The case in point is this: I have a group of loose rooms and they need to be connected to each other. The catch is that I want the rooms to be as natural and short as possible so that they do not create a web of tunnels but just connect the large open spaces. (https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/ervdpu/merging_overlapping_rooms/) I thought perhaps dijkstra is the most efficient because there is no given end point, it has to detect the closest usable floortile from another room as that endpoint. (I say usable because corners dont make for nice connections.) Is my hunch about dijkstra correct?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Shadowcasting for dummies?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-03 17:00:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, I am once again asking for your ~~financial~~ technical support. I have worked my way back up to Field of View (or Field of Vision) . Like with previous algorithms I have been comparing several types of shadows and rays and I have decided that I want to try out Recursive Shadow Casting, since it not only looks the nicest (In my opionion) but also doesnt require rays. After scouring the web once again, I found countless beautiful demonstrations of FOV in action. However finding a somewhat understandable guide was more challenging. From the few I found and somewhat understood I think it comes down to: 1. Somehow drawing a circle around your @ 2. Dividing the circle around your @ into 8 'quadrants' (octants?) 3. And then somehow looping through every gridcell in that pie-slice. I have a few questions thought: 1. What do I use to draw that circle around my @? I get that it has to do with range but how do I determine what cells are X amount of cells away? 2. I am guessing the dividing of the pie-slices is done with trigonometry, but I am not A\* (a star, sorry XD) in mathematics. 3. Do I use floodfill or something to iterate through that slice now? 4. Am i keeping this KISS, or is this way way more simple than I am thinking? Help, pseudo-code, advice, articles, videos or even smoke signals are much appreciated! I basically want to make my cave look less like it out in the bright sun, so I am going to play around with brightness gettting lower the further the away a cell is from the player.... If someone knows how to do that at the same time as doing plain FoV I would very much like your help!  #8203; Thanks guys!  #8203; EDIT: I got my circle drawn around my @.  #8203; [Omniscience muahahaha...](https://preview.redd.it/xt6d2olypre41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=edb500f8faf61ed60f4cf0171a11964c6f5a6820)  #8203; EDIT 2: I understand why this \[see below\], casts the shadow the way it does (iterating from top to bottom), the article on roguebasin mentions slopes, can anyone explain? [So apparently I am supposed to do something with 'slopes'?](https://preview.redd.it/ks9bdh4x3ve41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=edde891f7f20b997b60170fe811f5da8e013bebf)</TEXT>

One last thing: what do I do with the slopes that I calculated? I reckon I store them and compare them to the slopes of the tiles behind it to check if they are the same slope? Or do I use the slopes to actually draw a black shadow overlay? I might be thinking too literal again?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Lost Webdesigner (WORKING TITLE)** Hi! This is my first post on sharing saturday, and my first post about my game really. Basically what I have done this week are two things. 1. Connecting every cave to the main cave (in the shortest/most natural way possible) 2. Started on Recursive Shadow Casting for FoV. Thanks to everyone again for helping out on the cavern issue, I got it to work thanks to many many helpful replies and suggestions. Next up is connecting rooms to caves (rooms are generated after the caverns and are not counted as caves). However I was kind of tired of caves, rooms and tunnels. That is why I decided to put that on ice for a moment and do something else = gt; FoV. I found that the caves were too bright so I wanted a small circle of light to always be around my @ and the rest of the cave is only barely visible (if it has been visited before of course). After researching some stuff I landed on Recursive Shadow Casting. I made a post on that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/eya2up/shadowcasting\_for\_dummies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/eya2up/shadowcasting_for_dummies/) I can still use some help on this though, but I might make a more nuanced post about it later this week if I still haven't figured it out by then. Anyway many thanks to the people who helped my out with the first steps on this as well! So what do I have on the agenda next week? Not too much to be honest, my internship as a webdesigner is gonna start and I suddenly will be sitting from 9 to 5 at my desk, development will be pushed to nightshifts ;). I will make a post about the project in general since I read you can post an introductory post about yourself and the project so I guess you will see that sometime next week. The main thing this week will be surviving work and getting my FoV done. Thanks and sorry for the long post,  #8203; Wouter</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-11 20:44:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, How is the start of your week going? I hope everyone is doing a lot better than I am! I am going to be honest with you, I am getting a bit sick and tired of Field of Vision and the shadowcasting algorithm. I just want it to work. Anyway, some things have clicked since the last time, like how I iterate and recognize blocking cells/blocking areas. So far, i have the loop and recursive part done and working like a charm, however I am still unsure on how I compare things to the shadow, which I think constists of the start and endslope? This is the shadow code:  #8203; [The selected part is my comparison.](https://preview.redd.it/03n8lv32wcg41.png?width=1409 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=be14d49c1ab26855163761359024fba767aa0a27) This doesnt work, big shock. However now that I think of it, perhaps my whole idea of a start and endslope as a shadow is bs since those are not unique values. Please guys, what am I missing?  #8203; Wouter EDIT: I am programming in JavaScript without Canvas EDIT 2: In reply to u/partybusiness this it does instead of working  #8203; [sometimes it highlights nothing](https://preview.redd.it/ce6z1zuekhg41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=8c38d34277f275ed2a8c62eebb9376c6313b2e6f)  #8203; [sometimes it highlights random strokes](https://preview.redd.it/hqackevgkhg41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=9edd5323796084ce00449da4159ddccdf57d7347)  #8203; [Sometimes it highlights the entire flipping area anyway...](https://preview.redd.it/527gyjqikhg41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=b1b60ab3404b19dde1432249bbba7891b019514a)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the quick reply! I have thought about doing this version of visibility first. Normally, and this time is no different, I am extremely stubborn. So I just want to _get_ this algorithm, however I am noticing that I am actually getting demotivated by it. I will probably take your advice if I haven't gotten a direct solution soon. Can you tell me if the Bresenham's line-algorithm work with a 2d array (which is how I store and manipulate my maps)? Rays and the like have always seemed daunting to me.

Of course the code does what I make it do, so that means I am garbage at what I do...  #8203; Also, at first I had every little thing be a global or local variable and seperate function, then I turned stuff into javascript objects with their own methods and attributes and now the entire game is 1 gigantic object with things like game.engine.random() and game.entities.player and the like. Perhaps I have gone overboard with the entire thing? If you have a wiser way of organising a game please do tell me because it is getting a bit difficult to keep track of things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well this week certainly flew past quickly. After 1 more post and great help from the community I got my goal of Fov complete... sort of... I opted to go for 'naive' Field of Vision instead of Recursive Shadowcasting. I feel defeated but I will tackle this beast another day. I felt demotivated from devving just because I couldn't figure that algorithm out. After some encouragement to just go with 'naive' FOV I did that and got it working within a day. The performance is no issue, just some artifacts and a few bugs which have to do with my rendering frame.  #8203; You can find the current build here: https://wouter-kool.nl/RL/  #8203; Goals for next week are fixing the bugs I created this week and preparing a enitiy-system for monster and NPC generation.  #8203; Thanks and see you next week!, Wouter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I am developing my first roguelike (not my first game mind you), but I have a hard time thinking of a hook. Both mechanically, visually and experience wise my game is non-distinct... However I read that the first roguelike should just be a technical proof of concept to get into it. Anyway, do you think I should find a hook ASAP or just build the engine and most basic version of a roguelike to use as a platform for later games? IF I should find a hook, what is a good way? I heard about the but-strategy where you think of something and add a twist to it using 'but' (A first person shooter, but you shoot portals instead of ammo) (A MOBA but you play in first person)  #8203; Any thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll try to just make the game as a blank sheet which I will fill with stuff I think will be cool. So far everything is pretty modular so putting stuff on or taking them off shouldn't be too big of a deal.

    <TEXT>Alright I understand your point. Your example however is very subjective (as all hooks are of course), but my main problem with it is dat it *doesnt* tell you WHY I should care or play. It tells who, what and short but not why. All your example tells me is that hooks nowadays have to be batshit crazy to work or catch on. Are you suggesting I have to make a meme game just to get some attention?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This week wasn't very fancy on the technical side. However I did grow as a developer and the game is about to undergo several big changes. After 4 weeks or so of working on this RL now, I realised my code is exponentially getting spaghettier... So I turned to the internet and researched ECS's. They blew my mind and obviously this is the future of my RL. I also posted about finding a hook this week, and got one out of it... I will post about my game and its hook once I have a better understanding of the outlines of my idea, but I am very excited about it myself, which helps stay focused on devving. I also created a rough key-only targeting system for future abilities, but that is when I realised the code was going off the rails and I had to find a solution first. Hope to have more to share next week! Wouter</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My save file has been corrupted for the third time this month</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-26 21:10:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I am to be quite frank extremely annoyed by this bug / problem I have been experiencing. Basically whenever my internet kicks the bucket dead cells will grab the last offline save file, which is from a few months ago and for some reason doesnt update to a newer version, and then overwrites my online (better) save file. This resets my progress and made me lose 1 boss cell (the second), the complete 2nd bar of the big forge guy and countless upgrades and costumes. I have experienced this problem for the 3rd time in a few months, recently on the day of the Bad Seed release, and have had the same problem before the 1.0.0 release. I honestly think Dead Cells is one of the most precious and amazing games of the past few years and I have supported it all throughout its development, but this is just extremely demotivating and annoying since it is just a lot of grinding down the drain (AGAIN!!!). Is there any way to fix or prevent this problem? Because I am at the verge of just deleting the game from my PC forever (oh yeah its the steam PC version of the game). Thanks in advance, Wouter (a loyal fan)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EDIT: \[SOLVED\] I solved the problem, I commented what happened and how I (will) fix it. Hello fellow dev-people, How is your monday going? I am experiencing an extremely weird bug/problem. Perhaps some of you can see something I cant...  #8203; [The code that creates the two frontend parts](https://preview.redd.it/ecvmvtos3nl41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=d1af0ced4edfb430148322ff5cefa71b9d87093e) As you can see, I create the player entity/components and then the floorchunk however the values that I set without the coordinator (so the frontend.element, position.x and position.y) of the player get overwritten by the floorChunk values... This shouldn't even happen and it somehow doesn't cause an error message. The only thing that now happens is that the player now has the frontend of the floor. Which leads to the floor falling due to gravity.  #8203; [Topleft the player, bottom the floor...](https://preview.redd.it/dfemp6sz3nl41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=c9792afc008e413135472a33fb2a69b705ee9af0) This is the frontend, and the black thing is the floor (falling into the abyss...). Well actually that black thing is the player but the player\_element is overwritten as the floor\_element. This is JS btw, please wait with throwing your stones until after I solve this...) If I switch them around the same thing happens, just... switched around. The player\_element gets rendered, but the floor is stuck in the topleft corner.  #8203; I hope you can help me, if there is something missing in my explaination just ask :D.  #8203; Thanks!  #8203; Wouter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, I solved this with the power of console.log and much hair being pulled out... I have figured this problem out however. You don't have to answer anymore, but I will leave my solution here in case ANYONE ever needs it... It is always so frustrating to see someone fix it but not tell how. Here I go. So the problem lies a bit deeper than I anticipated. I have built my own ECS to handle entities and their components. In order to add a 'fresh' component to the Entity, I have a function in the component\_manager that gets a premade component from the component\_library (a big array with dummy components, to be ***copied.*** I highlight, copy because that is what the code doesn't do... It just refers to the dummy component in the library and I was changing value of the template not the actual copies. I will have to track down how to make actual copies instead of references, but that is what caused the problem of overwriting values. I hope anyone in the future can avoid the annoyance I experienced during this. Wouter</TEXT>

Hope this will be helpful for someone one day!  #8203; (link to a similar problem on stackOverflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12690107/clone-object-without-reference-javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12690107/clone-object-without-reference-javascript) )</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ECS Standards</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-12 12:39:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I have been building my own implementation of an Entity Component System. It is build in JavaScript and my game is a 2d sidescroller (roguelike ofcourse). Now I was stresstesting the ECS the other day (you may have seen my video earlier), and I was wondering what is considered normal in terms of what an ECS should be able to handle. I noticed that it can handle about 2000 entities (all jumping, colliding and rendering entities), before the fps slowed down from 60 to about 20-30 fps... it took 25.000 of those dummies to slow down to 1fps... and after that the game did about 1 frame per 3-5 seconds... I was wondering if there are things to keep in mind when using this datastructure to optimise performance at all times. Would love to hear your ideas and tips! \- Wouter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So far every system in my version of the ECS has access to an array with the entity that match the required "tuple" of compents (not really a tuple since those do not exist in JS). And then every system iterates over their set of matching entities. So first physics iterates over all their entities and the collision and then transform and then render etc etc. Perhaps this is not the ideal way?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks so much for taking the time to give such a well thought out and indepth answer!  #8203; I have thought of another way to prevent unnecissary system runs: States. The entity has a seperate state (or states, haven't thought that out yet), which act as a second parameter to the systems besides the required\_component\_tuple. If an entity with matching components does not have the required state (e.g airborne for gravity to work), the system skips this entity until the next iteration. This could perhaps be optimised by sending the system updated signals if the state changes, instead of checking the state every iteration.  #8203; States could potentially prove usefull in terms of animation later on too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[HELP] Troubleshooting 2D Collisions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-17 14:14:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I am back, this time not with some crazy algorithm but with something more simple. At least that's what I thought. Turns out collision detection is a bit more tricky than I hoped. Alright lets start with what my goal is: If my character walks/jumps/run/whatevers into the floor or wall, it should be stopped and its position has to be against the wall. What did I do first? box1 = player (for the rest of the post) box2 = a wall or floor, assume a square if(box1.left  lt;= box2.right  amp; amp; box1.right  gt;= box2.left  amp; amp; box1.top  lt;= box2.bottom  amp; amp; box1.bottom  gt;= box2.top){ // Do the thing This is standard practice I found and the only way to detect if anything is overlapping. Then I wanted to detect what side the player is colliding the wall from. I don't want to run into it on the left and be teleported to the right (as entertaining as that is). so once again I had my code: if(box1.top  gt; box2.top){ // BOTTOM } if(box1.top  lt; box2.top){ // TOP } if(box1.left  lt; box2.left){ // LEFT } if(box1.left  gt; box2.left){ //RIGHT } Now you may already guess it, but this devides into horizontal and vertical and will always trigger 2 conditions... This makes you zap to all the corners of the square but never in the middle, where you collided... I tried this:  gt;if(box1.right  gt;= box2.left  amp; amp; box1.left  lt;= box2.right){  gt;  gt; // Check if you are in the horizontal middle  gt;  gt; if([box1.top](https://box1.top) \ gt; [box2.top](https://box2.top)){// BOTTOM  gt;  gt; }else if([box1.top](https://box1.top)  lt; [box2.top](https://box2.top)){ // TOP}  gt;  gt;}else{  gt;  gt; // Check if you are in the vertical middle  gt;  gt; if(box1.left  lt; box2.left){ // LEFT  gt;  gt; }else if(box1.left  gt; box2.left){ // RIGHT}  gt;  gt;} This works wonders for the vertical plane (so TOP and BOTTOM collisions work perfectly), but the horizontals are not working any better than the previous step: zipping you to the corners....  #8203; [What is happening on the frontend...](https://reddit.com/link/fk5y81/video/n18ht9b4r8n41/player) Finally my question: how do I solve this for every corner? It must be possible right? Am I missing something?  #8203; \- Wouter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like your way of thinking but there is 1 problem with that, if I am falling on top of the square, and my velocityX is just a bit higher than the velocityY... I will get teleported to the side of the floor and possibly out of bounds. To clarify, the game is a platformer, but for the exaple .mp4 I disabled gravity so that I didn't have to finick around with jumps.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2D Collision Resolution: a solution</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-20 12:16:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone, I have been asking questions on this sub for a few months now and I have been hacking away at building my own RL. A few days ago I started working on collisions in my 2D Platformer. I already had a very basic if-statement to not fall through the floor at all times, but it was time to do things right. Like, I think, pretty much everyone who is faced with this problem I still had the idea of 2 bounding\_boxes colliding which somehow had to figure out what should happen after they overlapped. I googled, asked around and tried a lot of stuff out: * Calculating the depth of overlap in the two dimensions * While loops * More than one bounding box At last I got a reply from u/[whiletruespork](https://www.reddit.com/user/whiletruespork/), and he sent me this link: [http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic\_Physics\_Guide?v=0](http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide?v=0) . I seriously want to thank him for taking the 5 minutes of his time to look this up and reply this, because it is what solved the problem. More specifically this gif made the lightbulb go off:  #8203; [link: https:\/\/info.sonicretro.org\/images\/b\/b2\/SPGPushingAnimated.gif ](https://i.redd.it/e0xefwcejtn41.gif) Now I immediatly thought this could work wonders, so I got to work.  #8203; [The detectors in the frontend](https://preview.redd.it/63j485td2un41.png?width=288 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=55cfde988f3cf8072d756c06488cfb8237a30ed3) Instead of handeling overlap with one bounding box, I now handle it using lines, which do overlap checks and handle the collision perfectly. No more weird zipping around to the corners of the platform. If you take a good look, you see I added a third vertical detector in the middle. This is for small platforms (in my case 50 x 50) which would not be picked up by either of the other 2 detectors. aditionally this can be used to detect edges: * 3 / 3 detectors colliding = stable ground; * 2 / 3 detectors colliding = near a ledge; * 1 / 3 detectors colliding = a real cliff hanger;  #8203; [I would have fallen through](https://preview.redd.it/io3cfhy5ltn41.png?width=196 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=de0030778556b239f2f2f2de8687c72abdb18312) If you remember sonic form above, he has a special animation balancing on ledges, if you wanted your dream ruined on how they did that, now you know. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this, further questions and tips are helpful. I hope I saved someone the headaches I had trying to re #239;nvent the wheel. \- Wouter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keep a Trello, you'll have to be consistent and disciplined but it really does work. Not only will you have a clear list of what your are doing, you can also keep track of long term goals. Using the checklist function gives a sense of progress and it is tremendously helpful to pick things back up. Using the Trello you can also leave notes for yourself when times get busy and see the bigger picture once you comeback. Also be sure to comment absolutely everything in your code, even if you think "Oh, I'll remember what it does", trust me you wont. You said yourself how hard it is to get back to work on a half-finished product. And IF you decide to start over, check your previous stuff for things you can cobble together and potentially fixup a bit. It'll save you a lot of time. Hope you keep going man!</TEXT>

To test this I introduced a sort of hadoken/fireball to spam. Next I found out what was holding the speed of my ecs back and fixing it doubled the amount of entities it could comfortably handle. Lastly I have built my own, pretty tight, collision detection system. I already made 2 posts about that, so you could have already seen that. For next week I hope to start on cameramovement and perhaps a paralax background. I might also draw a custom pixel art dummy to replace the one I have at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Trigonometry] Points along a circle</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-03 11:16:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I am developing a game, and some math is required. Normally I would google this but I have no clue what to look for in this case. I think this will be a piece of cake for everyone here, so please help me! I have a player, the most important thing about him is his center, which is the origin point. Around the origin point is an imaginary circle with a known radius. The cursor is the only other known point to which I draw a line. I want to draw two (imaginary) lines both 22.5 degrees from the cursor point/line. The length of all three lines (the one to the cursor, the one to the counterclockwise point and the one to the clockwise point) are the known radius. What is the formula to get the clockwise and counterclockwise points along that circle? Thanks in advance! Wouter (a desperate not so mathematician)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Trigonometry] Calculating angles on a screen</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-06 11:03:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, For a project of mine I am calculating 3 angles and comparing their angles in degrees. You have to see it as a detection cone which is detecting a point. Anyway, I have 1 origin point and 2 points that are *radius* length away, 45degrees apart from each other. The angle to the origin changes based on the mouse position on screen (did I mention this is a webbased project?). Anyway to calculate the angle to the origin point i use this function in pseudo-code: `angleToPoint1= Math.atan2(point_y, point_x) - Math.atan2(origin_y, origin_x)` However I think this is wrong since from my understanding this tries to compare the angle between 2 vectors? In all honesty I am confused by all the terms and I would like to learn more about this to really understand what I am doing and what I *should* be doing. please help me? Wouter  #8203; Edit: I know Math.atan2 returns radians and not degrees.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi thanks for replying! I forgot to tell you what I know already. I know about vectors and that for an angle to be present there must be 2 vectors (or three points). In my case I believe the vectors would be from the origin to point1 and the other the positive x-axis, although I could be mistaken there. I have seen some diagrams of the atan2 function but I am not sure how and why it works. Perhaps you could tell me more about that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While normally I would recommend going for svg (or any other vector format) instead of bitmap, in this case I think pixelart is the way to go. Unless your vector art is professionally made and looks absolutely stunning (which is costly mind you), it will give off this shady vibe of an old flash game played on a site where you are never really sure if an adult popup is gonna fill your screen and ruin your eyes forever. The kind of game that surely someone has put in a lot of effort and time but you can't help but feel like it is a cheap and crappy copy of something. Now, I know I sound like I have a personal vedetta against vector art, but you asked for opinions. While pixelart is kind of like the a trope (read clich #233;) in indie games nowadays, if done even half correctly it will fill any enthusiast with at least joy and curiosituly abouy your game. Not to mention that decent pixelart can probably be cheaper than the same amount of half-decent vector art. my final verdict would be this: reel people in with some pixely beautiful pixels instead of scaring them off by reminding them of all the times they went on probably unsafe, crappy gamesites</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Impulse Resolution of 2d collisions results in (seemingly) arbitrary large results</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-29 09:54:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, This is my first time posting, so forgive me if I haven't understood something about the subreddit yet. I hope you can help me. I have, like all foolish young programmers, decided to build a simple rigid body physics engine. I have succesfully implemented AABB and SAT and position resolution, the next step would logically be impulse resolution, for which I followed Randy Gaul's tutorial on both his site and tutplus. It is stated by him that his solution isn't waterproof and just a proof of concept but judging by the demo's it should work just fine for a simple engine like mine. To get to the point, I have implemented his solution but it seems random... sometimes the boxes bounce back in a seemingly correct way other times it will suddenly decide that the impulse scalar is ranging in the thousands, making the box propell itself forward near lightspeed. `function impulse_resolution(pbody1, pbody2, normal){` `let n = normal;` `let v1 = pbody1.motion_data.linear_velocity;` `let v2 = pbody2.motion_data.linear_velocity;` `let m1 = pbody1.physical_properties.mass();` `let m2 = pbody2.physical_properties.mass();` `let inv_m1 = pbody1.physical_properties.inv_mass();` `let inv_m2 = pbody2.physical_properties.inv_mass();` `let relvel = [v1[0] - v2[0], v1[1] - v2[1]]` `let normalVelocity = (n[0] + relvel[0]) * (n[1] + relvel[1]);` `if(normalVelocity  gt; 0){` `return` `}` `let e = Math.min(pbody1.physical_properties.restitution, pbody2.physical_properties.restitution)` `let j = -(1 + e) * normalVelocity / inv_m1 + inv_m2;` `let impulse = [j * n[0], j * n[1]]` `let impulse_A = [impulse[0] * inv_m1, impulse[1] * inv_m1]` `let impulse_B = [impulse[0] * inv_m2, impulse[1] * inv_m2]` `pbody1.motion_data.linear_velocity = [(pbody1.motion_data.linear_velocity[0] - impulse_A[0]), (pbody1.motion_data.linear_velocity[1] - impulse_A[1])]` `pbody2.motion_data.linear_velocity = [(pbody2.motion_data.linear_velocity[0] + impulse_B[0]), (pbody2.motion_data.linear_velocity[1] + impulse_B[1])]` `}` Writing loose code will probably not be enough so here is the link to Randy's course, and below you'll find a video with my problem recorded. link [here](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331).  #8203; [ As you can see it seems to work in the beginning, but it quickly spirals out of controll with random velocity being added from somewhere. \(don't mind the debug lines\) ](https://reddit.com/link/ga6m0r/video/c54w9r2wbqv41/player) I am not a physics or math expert at all, so any solution, tip or even just an explaination to perhaps make this problem clearer is very much welcome! If there is a better way of doing impulse resolution also please let me know! Thank you for reading and perhaps helping! Wouter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks really good already. If I may offer a few points of attention: -the normal walk is very stiff and could do with some shoulder movement, she walks like a fridge with arms. (The run is better, since she leans into it and it looks like she is actually using her body to run) -After rewatching it, I still have no idea what the bubble does, is it a suppression field, a shield, does it allow you to fly? -The fireball takes a bit too long for it to feel good, if you know what I mean. The hand movements are nice but a simple fireball must be easier and faster to conjure than a meteor shower. -The effect of the meteorshower on the collosusses (collosi?) and goblins seemed underwelming. It takes long to conjure and aim but then it doesn't rain death and dispair upon the enemy, more like a nice refreshment after training. Perhaps tweak the damage stats for that one. Overall it looks very diverse, interesting, well polished and simply good! You found a new follower in me, can't wait to see more. EDIT: With meteor shower I mean both the many small ones and the big icy one. The icy one feels a bit light. Perhaps you can convey more impact with some more camera shake?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help me out with my game development project</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-26 17:34:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi FGC, I have been a lurker for while, but now I need your help. As every fan of fighting games who has the slightest artistic or technical skill, I want to make a game. A fighting game. The problem is that I like so many others struggle with coming up with creative ideas. You see I can talk to you all day on the technical side and I watch videos on the art and beauty of fighting game animation almost every waking hour. But coming up with a good concept for a fighting has proven to be hard. I keep going in circles between existing products that I could emulate but that is not really what I want to do. So to get to the point... I need your help! Help figure me out what style, gameplay aspect, setting, character ideas whatever it is you have, that can help me conceptualize this game as something unique yet appealing to the true core. I would ask this question in r/gamedev or their discord but honestly this is something only the FGC can help me with. The only thing that is set in stone right now is that the game is 2D (sprites, and gameplay). To everyone who replies, thank you in advance! Wouter  #8203; Ps. Yes, I am aware that developing a game is hard, developing a good fighting game is extremely extremely hard. PPs. Don't wory about costs or something, I'll figure it out. PPPS. If this is the wrong flair let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for replying! Really appreciate your comment! I am unsure what I like most about fighting games most. Landing a parry is the best feeling ever (Ryu sfv). But on the other hand I don't enjoy watching a very defensive-oriented match. Then there is the problem that I simply don't know what makes a good combo, so how can I invent them. One thing I did find is that jumping into development without any sense of purpose or direction leads to a failed project, which is why I am looking for suggestions that spark my imagination. What do YOU like the most in fighting games, perhaps it'll give me a better sense of direction. Anyway thanks again for the great reply! :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! Thanks for leaving a reply, greatly appreciated! I didn't mention it, but I started with exactly what you suggested. Set up a local server, started testing the connection, dropped in some assets and got some movement options. Very barebones, rough and quick, like a minimum viable product should be. My error was that I had planned out nothing, except for the 'oh its gonna be 2d'. I had gone to the extreme of not planning. I do appreciate the warning against the other extreme of overplanning. I am currently in the process of finding a happy medium. I am taking a week or so to find something I think is worth starting to build. Then it'll take me another week or so to actually roughly sketch out in what order i'll start doing things. I realise that things will change, but long live tools like trello and an old fashioned devlog. I really do appreciate the warning though! If you are interested, I posted a short gif of the menu on r/indiegamedevforum: [\[link to reddit post\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegamedevforum/comments/hfa1ii/would_love_some_critique_on_the_design_and_effect/). It's the menu I made. You'll notice it's oddly polished for a MVP and thats because I got stuck on what to do next. The last thing I'd ask you, but you are of course not obliged to, is to tell me what you like about fighting games and what you like to see in them, similar to \_Herzenswarme above.

    <TEXT>Hi all, I am a starting developer looking to develop a game. The project I am working on is a fighter in which people who controll the elements duke it out. When I say controll the elements I mean it in the way of bending in Avatar. I am not making a fangame using their characters since that would probably get tricky with laws and legal stuff. Anyway I am just looking for the right style, some poses and well concept art. Since I am not a (concept) artist myself I am trying to get into contact with someone willing to help me out. As it turns out that is pretty hard since I have posted on multiple places and noone seems to respond. So I hope I finally found the right place to look. Just respond in the comments if you are interested. Or let me know where to find people that can help me.</TEXT>

I am really unfamiliar with the design and art side of gamedevelopment so I am really not sure what you would need. Perhaps I interpret it wrong, so forgive me, but is concept art not the very first art you create? In terms of budget I don't know what type of art and budget I need... I can say I have a budget of 200 euros but it has to stay feasible you know, in the end this is really only a hobby so sinking thousands of dollars at the start isn't really a long term strategy... Perhaps you can advise me on this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright I suppose you make a fair point. But perhaps I am still looking at the wrong place. Since my project is a hobby that I want to take serious perhaps I should be looking for an artist that does the same. I am wanting to learn more about the industry though, especially the side I am least familiar with. Can you tell me more about what the real purpose of concept art is for. I get the feeling I don't understand why I would need it. In my eyes it's an R amp;D tool to figure out my story but perhaps I am thinking too technical about it. I must be honest that I find it hard to come up with anything more substantial than the intitial concept of Bending Fighting Game... I normally just jump in and start making character controlls and the likes. But for this project I wanted to do it right, only to realise I have no idea what the 'right' way is...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, a ton for explaining. But as I said this is a fighting game (not a movie btw) which generally do not require story to function as a game, although it's a nice touch... Can't concept art not be used to create 4 characters for each of the 4 elements they controll? Or are you suggesting I hire an expensive employee for my not-to-be-taken-seriously hobby project to create Tolkien like world before starting development. I must be honest when I say that all this crap about story and research are getting extremely tiresome. I just want some art that showcase the concept of the game which I can show people when they ask about the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not quite sure what you mean by legal? Do you mean the models? There are no official non-primaris lieutenants as far as I know so I had not much of choice haha. If you mean a boltgun and a powerfist.. according to the october codex it is fine I think.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Updated firstborn Space Marine models in the future?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 23:50:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>First post here and immediatly a question which has probably been asked a million times.. I have since a month started with space marines, but only non-primaris. I love the models for primaris, I just think the oldies have something special. This question is actually fueled by curiosity about the past of 40k. The tactical marine models we have today are updated from the monopose, hunched over minis from a time where the grass was always green and the shoulderpad trim yellow. These models seemingly got fased out, but how? For the 'new' marines (primaris) they thought of entire backstories, lore and practically made up a different type of supersoldier. How did GW get away with updating all of the oldest models to tactical marines back in the day? And now that tactical marines are no longer completely in the shadow of Primaris and the Primaris range slowly filling out all the slots.. Do you think GW would ever update the Tacticall Marine models to look more modern (closer to the detail and crispness of the Primaris range?) Please don't smite me if this is a 'dumb' question, for I am but a 40k neophyte..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for taking the time to reply so well! Really interesting how they updated the models. I guess that explains why the bits and pieces I got a while back seem to closely resemble the latest tacticals but not quite match.. Unfortunate that they would (probably) do away with some of their most iconic design. I suppose it remains a business at its core. I better start liking the primaris more then. Thanks for explaining!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, although I certainly was not envisioning this in the near future anyway.. Perhaps in a few years when both primaris is stable and other factions have had their turn in the spotlight.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Phobos Only Space Marine Chapter?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:33:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>As a new player I have no real idea of what a balanced army should have. I just look at models I find cool and hope I will get the money to buy them one day.. Now when it comes to models I like, the phobos-armor range is absolutely stunning I think. The idea of ninja space marines hopping in and out of battle, tactically thinking through every move and receiving buffs from their captains and lieutenants. Hiding in dense terrain, patiently waiting for the oppurtunity to charge out of cover and massacre the startled enemy forces, only to disappear just as quickly. Maybe my lack of gameplay experience is making me think this is actually more fun than it is.. Is it even possible to do hit and run tactics with Space Marines? Is the phobos range diverse enough to feel threatening? Or should they only be used as a small complimentary force to the regular marines? EDIT: Perhaps it is good to also state that I am not looking to win every tournament or even game ever.. I just want a cool army which might be gimmicky and fun to play.. (I generally don't mind losing games in general, as long as I had fun)</TEXT>
