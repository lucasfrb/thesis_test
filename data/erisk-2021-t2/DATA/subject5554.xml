    <TEXT>I think there can be like hireable NPCs that spawn in your world. You can give them money and they will fight for you for a certain amount of time. You have to give them the health potions, the weapons, armor, equipables, you can acces their inventory by right clicking them and selecting the inventory option. Their power would be same as ours. For example you have 30 defense and 30 damage if you give the NPC the same armor/weapon/equipables it will have 30 defense and 30 damage too, this NPCs would like the Desert biome(because arms dialer likes there) and would be sad if one of them dies. If you gave them potions they would automatically drink them if they are fighting. They could have 2 male and 2 female variants. Thanks for reading I would like to see this in game I know there will be no updates but a crazy person can make a mod if you make a mod about this please comment under this post</TEXT>

I play a world for about 10 hours on singleplayer and I stop playing it. Some of you may complete the game in that time but I love progressing slow. I went to end once with my friends. But we cheated while doing that because we were bored. BUT I have a new world with a friend and we will go to end without cheats. Wish me luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The "Deepstone" pickaxe maybe can be used to break bedrock(you cant get the item) you should be able to get a few of them without going below bedrock because there cant be an already existing gap in the bedrock layer, there can be dungeon-like things in the End which would contain 1 deepstone and there could be 3 dungeons so you can craft a pickaxe but this dungeons would be really difficult and only could be accesed when the ender dragon is defeated.You could find the dungeons close to the main island.</TEXT>

But they dont. What I try to say: You shouldnt say "minecraft good, tiktok bad, fortnite bad" just because most of reddit think that.</TEXT>

Bad thing is, I went to that group myself because i had a friend in the group. Ngl he tried to help, but usually my ideas were happening. Whatever it is the last day, mine is ready, my friend's somewhat ready. Other 2 dont even care. My friend and I did the thing. One of the others did it. Btw they all asked stuff about the homework last night. One of them didnt even care. Teacher didnt want to give him 0(which is F for you United States of USA people, it is obvious but whatever) So the teacher gave him extra days, and oh boy... he didnt do it.

    <TEXT>I mean, minecraft can be a very complex game if you let it be, if you think like that, every single addition ruins the simplicity. Yes, there is a limit. You cant just add anything you want. About this spesific topic; You can use fireworks and an elytra to save yourself from falling into the void, but this requires endgame stuff. This would be very good for someone with midgame gear killing the ender dragon. But if this item is an endgame item, it is stupid. A midgame player should be able find/craft it in the overworld/nether without going to end</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes people dont understand how serious being suicidial can be, because there are idiots faking it for attention. Instead of insulting the person who says they are suicidial, people should ask why, after talking to them, you can understand if they are actually suicidial or not. Some suicidial people become depressed and suicidial because of "small" problems that they really care, this should be taken seriously, too. OP, if you EVER think about suiciding, just think about what is wrong with your life, is it worth doing this, and can you fix it? Nothing is worth suiciding.</TEXT>

A lot of people do it, so it is normal for me, but that is a perspective too, however I think reinstalling the windows is the safest and easiest way to go, because when you just reinstall windows, you dont need to think about deleting the virus, trying not to corrupt the files and stuff like that.</TEXT>
