    <TITLE>If you're about to die and someone says they will go to a new timeline to "save" you, are they really saving you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-30 06:18:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I been reading stories where the MC can go to new timelines to "prevent" something from happening. But are they really preventing it from happening, since it technically still happens in the timelines they abandon? Like if you're in a room that's about to explode from a bomb. A guy walks up to you and says "I will save you" he then disappears from the room and goes to a new timeline, he stops the bomb from exploding. But you still end up dying in the original timeline. Does that mean he didn't actually save you? I ask this question because I don't see the point here. It seems like the only one who gets saved here is the person who jumps to a new timeline.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am autistic, I have had at least 6 people tell me about how they were raped/abused (The incidents happened years before they told me). I usually try to encourage them to go to the police about it. (none of them have). But now I'm starting to think if I was supposed to respond differently, do I just listen without saying anything? What do I say to them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Majority of Ippo's fights are him getting a one-sided beatdown and then he gets a lucky punch that leads to a comeback, when Ippo finally wins he walks out looking like a bum who didn't deserve the victory. Then we see Sendo vs the #2 Boxer and it had the same outcome. I mean it's already written on the wall at this point that Ricardo is going to slap Ippo's ass for 40 chapters, Ippo gets ONE punch in, Ricardo is then wounded and starts making mistakes. Then Ippo gets 2 more punches in and the fight is now over. There's no way he will write a convincing win for Ippo.</TEXT>

When the new tekken  amp; street fighter comes out, I'm expecting them to make fan favorites exclusive. We already know that developers are sellouts like what happened with Samurai Shodown.

    <TITLE>How can Psychiatrists sleep at night knowing they ruin some peoples lives?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 04:27:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>If a patient tells the doctor "I lost my ability to feel emotions" the doctor won't bat an eye, they will tell the patient to keep taking the pill. How do these people live with their self when they do this? How do they go about their day and sleep well knowing that they have harmed people and did irreversible damage to people. Also when a patient commits suicide after the treatment I'm sure they blame the patient and probably think they weren't taking the pills correctly. I think my psychiatrist might be a psychopath, he just stared at me and smiled when I said I lost my empathy and emotions and lost my sex drive. He told me to keep taking the pill despite this. I looked back at him and I didn't see any doubt or guilt. Edit: [look at the bottom comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/i57avf/how_can_psychiatrists_sleep_at_night_knowing_they/g0ncn33/) When something goes right, psychiatrists will take credit for it. When something goes wrong, they blame the patient and say "well you shouldn't have taken the pill then, it was your choice"</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is it possible that Doctors deliberately hide information because of liability issues?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-08 22:27:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this is a conspiracy theory with no evidence but I'm wondering if it's actually possible? For example there's not much research done on antipsychotics killing your emotions, but it's common knowledge to people outside of the medical field. I'm starting to think they don't research a lot of dangers in the medicine and collect data because it could lead to them becoming liable. If it becomes proven that antipsychotics have a decent chance of ruining your life and doctors were knowingly prescribing them, then that's a slam dunk lawsuit to give medication that is *expected* to eventually cause harm to people. Also giving people addictive medicine that makes their brain so dependent on it, that if they were to suddenly go without it they kill their self is stupid in itself. I am starting to believe that the reason why the issues mentioned in this subreddit aren't being addressed in the medical field is because if it gets acknowledged you will screw their entire industries profits. I mean how the fuck do doctors not know what they're doing to people? How come they don't warn people before giving the pills? it's to protect their self. The more you know about the damage medication can do to you. The more likely you are to sue. If someone died from heart failure it could've been from the medication but they won't know that because the doctors didn't inform them.</TEXT>

I know some people said the game will have much more missions, but if developers are trying to advertise this game then they would want to show us just how cool the missions get right?

    <TEXT>Loot scales with your power. The most optimal way to getting good loot is to just equip the gear with the higher power regardless of what modifiers and other stats it has. All the effects gear has seems to become irrelevant as a result until you reach the cap. I might find a really cool piece of gear that has a cool effect, but if I equip it I won't be able to get better gear because its power level will get outdated after 2 missions.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-23 07:52:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>What's going to happen is a lot of players will just find the most optimal mission for getting gear, and with the power system in place you can spam that same mission from early game to endgame. I know there will be raids, so that just leaves it down to.. * what is the best mission for getting artifacts * what is the best mission for getting legendaries. Do these 2 missions till you reach endgame and then you spam the best mission for exotics. Even if the game ends up having 100 missions, only 3 will be relevant. The worst part to all of this is that you won't be able to find other players for the 77 other missions. I already had trouble finding people to match up with on ~~brutal  amp; hard~~ challenge 3  amp; 4. Now imagine how hard it's going to be if the matchmaking system has to account for all the different power levels and missions and difficulties. you will NEVER find people to play with on most missions unless this game has 100k+ people playing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Diablo and other dungeon crawlers/looters have you drowning in loot, path of exile has some crazy loot in it with the random modifiers, and the enemies in the game can have random modifiers on them. This game really lacks that variety. Why would you add a looting system but half-ass it? I'm just chasing higher numbers instead of having loot that completely changes the gameplay. It would've really spiced up the repetitiveness if I equip something that causes everything to change. These developers copy looters and learn nothing from it. Almost all the loot in the game is disappointing stat padding. Take less damage, do more damage. Low chance to proc something, stun more.. etc..</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the playerbase you see when a game first becomes playable is significantly larger than how it would look a week or 2 after. 7k becomes 3k. With 80+ missions  amp; tons of campaign missions + different difficulties along with matchmaking looking for people who have similar levels/power...expect VERY long queue times after the first month. I'm expecting the playerbase to be sitting around 1-2k after september. 30% is generous when a game is well received. But this game was badly received so it'll be much lower. Also this game doesn't perform well on the average GPU, steam has statistics on what type of GPU people have, and majority of PC gamers do not have one that will run this game well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is the biggest concern. The way other dungeon crawlers  amp; looter games combat repetition is by giving you loot that drastically changes your playstyle. Like in borderlands a gun might fire explosives, or in path of exile all your attacks shoot off lightning bolts. This game neglects that, instead we have loot that does simple stuff. Also other looters have you drown in loot, so 5 minutes later you're doing completely different stuff with the gear you just found. Gear completely changes the effects of all your abilities, but in this game it's just stat modifiers or having a small chance to proc something. Also mission variety is us just clearing waves of robots or defending something.</TEXT>

So he has to think and figure out how to plan out his chapters to get the story he wants.

    <TEXT> gt;I really don't think it will, it has terrible word of mouth, and the trailers don't even make it look fun Didn't stop no man's sky and other games from selling like crazy. As it stands people are very skeptical of this game but STILL will buy it. A lot of people are saying "I know this game is going to likely suck but I am still going to buy and hope the story is good"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guild Wars 2 has it where it's a REQUIREMENT to getting the best gear in the game, there's some stuff that is only available if you log in every day for 30-60 days in a row. There's also a daily limit that you can get rewards from certain content. This means if you play 12 hours a day once a week, you'll progress WAY less than someone who plays 20 minutes a day every day. Which begs the question, what's the point to playing the game if you have a life or other things you like doing with your time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Developers need to take a lesson from stuff like path of exile and other looters. You could pick up some staff, and now your attacks are firing lightning bolts everywhere. Pick up the next weapon, and it now poisons everything, pick up the next weapon and you're now burning everything.. Yes this game has some loot that has a chance to proc effects, but they don't really change your playstyle as drastically as other looters. Borderlands is a shooter and yet those guns change the way you fight so much while I don't notice the modifiers in this game unless I read the description and try hard to notice it.  gt;unless it changes at endgame While I do hope endgame is good, I hope developers rework the loot we get early/mid-game, because most of our playtime is going to be leveling. So far the loot I get boosts my damage, or my survival. Even stuff like proccing shock damage, is just giving me more damage and doesn't change playstyle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Biggest issue I have is it's a looter game with AWFUL loot. - Do more damage - Take less damage - Have a chance to inflict a certain type of damage - Chance that doing X will give an invuln/defense/attack buff or gives willpower/heroic burst. That's 99% of the loot in the game. It's fucking horrible! The loot doesn't change gameplay in any noticeable ways and it's just grinding for the sake of stat padding but since enemies scale with your level, you will NEVER notice yourself getting stronger. This game is a disaster, endless grind.</TEXT>

He could be sniping Shigaraki right now while he's vulnerable but he won't. He could just spam nukes but Hori will rather have him just watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You want to see how the game evolves, but you don't realize that those thousands of players who enjoy it, will lose interest when they realize it's shallow right? People are already talking about how the game is inferior to other looter games. I promise you, after a month at least 95% of the playerbase will be gone and when that happens the developers will stop making content for the game cause no more money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With all the people who recently got burned by anthem and other games you can't expect this. The game is already getting lots of backlash where people are expecting it to suck because the other games did. Also since other games are better right now, why would people play an inferior game hoping it'd get better, when they could play a better game that is also getting better. It's not like warframe and other games can't continue to evolve constantly leaving avengers in its shadow. Too many AAA games are flopping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, I own the game so you already said something false. Also, destiny survived before the big boom of these kind of games started appearing. Imagine if Destiny 1 came out in 2020 when there were already other games that were far ahead of it. Now Avengers comes out as a shitty destiny 1 and looks outdated compared to other looter games. Trying to eat from the same market of much better games. Why would people play a worse game over a better game? There's a reason why battleborn, anthem and other games flopped. People don't want to play a bad game if there's a better game around the corner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imagine before we saw the outcome of Sendo's fight. A random redditor told you that Sendo was going to beat the #2 Boxer by just throwing wild swings, no strategy, no blocking, no dodging.. just throwing massive swings till he wins. This whole community would've made fun of that person and said it's impossible for Sendo to win by doing that. Now look at you guys, you're saying that Ricardo is going to stomp Sendo in the first round. How can you guys still think that after seeing how the last fight just went? For you to think that Sendo has no chance against Ricardo requires you to pretend that his fight with Gonzalez didn't just happen, and that Woli and many other fights never happened in this series. Morikawa isn't going to waste years of our life on a fight where we already know Sendo is going to lose...only for him to just lose. That won't progress the story, if he needed Sendo to lose.. he would've lost against Gonzales.. You guys are in for a rude awakening and I can't wait for the shitshow this subreddit will turn into when it happens.</TEXT>

An advantage Sendo has over these "high level boxers" is mental games don't work on him, he's a wild animal. While ricardo  amp; billy are staring at each other, wondering what to do. Sendo would've just leaped in and attacked and that scares the fuck out of other boxers how fearless he is. He doesn't need high level knowledge. *Gonzalez* had high level knowledge and lost to no knowledge. What good is a little extra knowledge going to do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The pacing of this chapter is a million times better than the rest of post-ts chapters. If Oda wrote this chapter like he did the other chapters, then the entire chapter would be gags ending on Franky's Radical beam with a cliffhanger of whether or not the attack did anything. But in this chapter, so many things happened.. every page felt like it was moving the story forward, developing the characters and was just overall entertaining. When people are complaining about one piece, it's because they missed having chapters like this. So much is going on, and it's all great. A lot of us got into one piece because we liked the strawhats, so I'm glad they're taking a focus again.</TEXT>

If Bakugo got over his issues a few arcs back, I don't think people would have problems with him. Also I don't know why Bakugo got so much focus if he's going to be irrelevant in fights. Right now he's shitting on endeavors character also, Endeavor is now a damsel in distress to a kid who just started learning to use his quirks? I know Deku is the main character, but the world he's written is starting to be unbelievable with how much everything revolves around Deku</TEXT>

It's a school board game where you take classes, level up your character, teach them new skills, get followers, go on dates. and at the end of the board game there's a tournament where all the players fight each other with the stats/skills they learned during the board game.. the board game has different endings based on choices you made, it's crazy as hell.. definitely wacky fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Weapon breaking is cool as fuck, I'd love it if we are constantly changing our style as we kill different monsters and get different weapons. Also we'll likely have a smaller roster so this is a way better route to go, where you play as link but have 50 different fighting styles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd rather them focus only on botw characters and giving us weapon switching like BOTW that changes our moveset. Instead of them bloating the roster with so many characters that they have no time to flesh any of them out. Recycled movesets is the worst. If we end up with the old characters with their recycled movesets then it will not feel like a new game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh and another thing, how about you have a main weapon you pick when you start the mission, but every weapon you find in the mission is breakable. Your main weapon is unbreakable. There's so much they can do with this. Like you find a flaming spear that burns everything it comes in contact with or a bow with lightning arrows. Add some strategy where players will look on the map to find certain types of enemies because they want their weapon because it's the bosses weakness. Your main weapon you can still customize and switch to different types so if you do have a preference, you're not locked out of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd go with having a main weapon that's unbreakable, but you can find breakable weapons. Your master sword is unbreakable, but if you pick up a monsters wooden spear then it can break. If you hate breakable weapons you can just avoid using them then. All it does is add tons of different movesets/variety to the game making it more exciting. Breath of the Wild sold 18 million units so saying breakable weapons is not compelling is dishonest especially claiming you have to go through 600 monsters. You just don't like it, that doesn't mean others can't enjoy it. Fire emblem warriors had you pause the game to send out orders, switch to different characters and missions that changed the pacing of the battle. Hyrule Warriors had you exploit enemy weaknesses and the bosses were slower paced at times due to having to go around the map and figure out how to beat them like a puzzle. Don't like it? Don't play it. With nintendo overseeing it they will change the gameplay mechanics from a standard musou.</TEXT>

If Deku ends up becoming too strong, then what are the next 100 chapters going to be about? Is he just going to keep one shotting every villain that shows up? Deku becoming the strongest at the end isn't a problem. Him becoming the strongest early in the series means that every fight is going to be dogshit. If the author finds a villain to give Deku a challenge, then the other superheroes will be useless due to power creep.</TEXT>

I shouldn't have to explain why people talk about series they're reading.  gt;Shiggy only had his Decay quirk "erased" IIRC. He had his other quirks erased too, Ragdolls quirk for example.  gt;Shiggy is only at 75% completion rate AND his body is breaking down from not being able to handle the quirk. All might was beaten down and it was made to look like he had no strength left, Hori has already proven himself to be a hack where "I'm tired" or "I'm weakened" doesn't stop a character from using their full power Even deku did this vs muscular.  gt;Deku literally has the most powerful people with him as he attempts to take on Shiggy. Endeavor had the same thing and still couldn't win while shigaraki had his quirks surpressed. If Deku can beat him with his quirks available then that's shitty writing. Shigaraki is even stronger than before he fought endeavor even with his "body breaking down".. now he has access to decay and other quirks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok i won't recommend DMT. DMT is actually safer than weed BUT, you *do* hallucinate for 10 minutes after taking it. If you're this paranoid I don't know what you will do when you end up seeing all these colors and hallucinating. You would need someone with you to calm you down. But after 10 minutes the ego death kicks in and you become calm like you never been before. I been suicidal, paranoid, had panic attacks and all sorts of things.. and all of that has been gone since the ego death. But I do know some people can't handle the hallucinations. You are forced to see them for 10 minutes, when I saw them I just laid down and kept saying "oh shit oh fuck" while a friend told me it'll end in 10 minutes and not to worry. Maybe there'll come a time later in life where you will be ready, but I tried everything..therapy, medication, etc. nothing helped me out as much as DMT. As for persistent effects, if you did get anything persistent then one pill of an antipsychotic stops it all. The only reason I suggested DMT is because nothing else helped me. I only had to take it ONCE in my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, all you need is a low dose. They say you need "3 hits" to see "everything" but you only need 1 hit and a small dose to get ego death. The higher doses is just the hippies who love seeing hallucinations and getting tripped out. If you do it, make sure someone is next to you. (I say this in case you get scared and forget that this will end in 10 minutes) The first minute you will see trippy patterns and you will get dizzy like you're going to throw up. You will need to lay down and relax while you're seeing this. After that, the patterns will go away and then you're losing balance, hearing shit and your senses are being overloaded. After 10 minutes, all of that ends and you begin to experience ego death. There's 2 things that make up your personality. 1. Is the "you" that is caused by your brains chemistry, genetics, etc. 2. Is the "you" that is caused by environment, how you were raised and external influences that affected you. (Such as if you were raped and it causes you to be extremely scared/paranoid, or if you were abused as a child and it makes you unstable) Ego death deletes the second one. So you get to experience what life is like without your ego holding you back, and it gives you Euphoria it makes you happy and calm. You no longer are insecure or worried about anything, you are completely happy with life as it is and you start to realize that anything that has bothered you was caused by your ego. Like some people get bothered thinking that other people have better lives than them, that jealousy consumes them. With ego death you won't think that anymore and you realize that shit is just stuff society caused us to feel.| After like 48 hours your ego comes back (meaning you go back to normal), but now that you experienced what life is like without the ego, you learn to disconnect yourself from those negative thoughts  amp; emotions and it makes it much easier to not let things bother you anymore when you realize that's not you that thinks that way, it's just your ego that's trying to make you miserable in life. If you can get an antipsychotic like Risperdal or something, a single pill is enough to end all of this and calm you down. I basically spoiled DMT for you, and people will get mad that I did. But it's to help you calm down when you do go through it. You will remember it all goes away in 10 minutes.</TEXT>

I might hop in on a mmorpg once a week and try to put 10 hours into it, but there's certain crafting material or other content that's locked behind dailies and the worst is when I have to log in 30 days in a row to get the really good rewards, and then it's even worse when dailies are exclusive to that month so I have to log in every day for the whole month to get stuff. Then you have some games where dungeon content is based around dailies, so if I wanted to do 10 dungeon runs in a day, it is worse than doing 2 dungeon runs on separate days. Fuck dailies. I want to play games when I feel like it, not when the developer tells me when I should.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Loot that drastically changes the way you play the game and adds more variety to the combat system. Games like path of exile and other games with randomized loot do things like making all your attacks fire lightning bolts that arc between enemies. So even if you played with a sword, depending on what gear you find, your playstyle could be completely different from others, such as massive aoes, etc. In this game it's about deciding which attacks you want to do more damage and instead of increasing the variety to the combat system it limits it. Look at borderlands in how much modifiers can change a gun. You could go from electrocuting everything with massive aoe explosions, pick up a gun 10 seconds later and you're now using a pistol machine gun that removes enemies armor. In Avengers loot does this. * Do more damage * Take less damage * Have a chance to inflict a certain type of damage * Chance that doing X will give an invuln/defense/attack buff. In other looter games, loot can even give you new abilities, like the ability to teleport and more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I been kinda indifferent about this game for a while because I was fighting the mechanics but now that everything clicked for me I'm starting to appreciate what it offers. One of the best things this game has is how spaced out the gameplay elements are to prevent me from feeling burnt out. How I'm rewarded for being engaged in every mechanic. Now that I realize I'm playing a once in a lifetime experience, I am starting to avoid using guides and take my time because I want to enjoy this experience for as long as possible. Before I was trying to kinda just get the game over with and move onto the next game. But this game is so relaxing and I don't want it to end now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny how other games can make people enjoy playing it every day without forcing dailies on you. Says a lot about the game when they have to resort to tactics like this because the rest of the game can't hold up. When you design it around being played every day, then you are isolating people who can't play every day and making the game an awful experience for them. No wonder the playerbase dropped to 1/4th of what it was before. Who the heck wants to play this game every day for months when there's tons of other games coming out? Why stick to 1 game that just has you do the same thing over and over?</TEXT>

Another thing is while multiplayer games are designed to be played every day. Not all of them are designed to punish you for not playing everyday. Which this game does. Someone who spends 10 hours in 1 day will progress less on their challenge card than someone who plays 30 minutes 3 days in a row. Most multiplayer games don't punish people like this.</TEXT>

Finished getting melee skills maxed out? Time to learn some ranged skills so you're not useless against certain enemies.

    <TEXT>actually if they have new content they will want to wait to release it with skins and stuff and use it as an opportunity to make more money. Such as they already planned on having limited time skins available. I'm guessing that to get those skins you also have to do an event like other games. Meaning halloween skins are tired to halloween-themed missions and villain, etc. I hate this game design though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What bothers me the most about Ippo's fights is sometimes he leaves the ring looking like he didn't deserve to win. Where he gets schooled on and only wins cause of a lucky punch. (I know lucky punches are real, but sometimes it looks like Ippo's training isn't paying off and the other boxer made Ippo look like an amateur who could only win thanks to luck) It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Edit: To clarify. Takamura got a lucky punch in before. But he would've never got to the point to where a lucky punch would save him if it wasn't for how strong he was and cornering his opponent. Meanwhile Ippo gets the SNOT beaten out of him and can't land a single punch until the lucky punch comes in. That's the difference between them, Ippo looks like he can't win without luck against some fighters. While Takamura's wins are more earned. For someone who might try to be the #1 boxer, you'd kinda expect more than this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is why a massive amount of people have been quitting games like heroes of the storm. I realized that if I start playing shit, I get matched up with top-tier players on my team who will carry me no matter how bad I did. I felt like I had no control over the outcome of the match. It's called forced 50% winrate. The matchmakings goal is to make sure everyone has an equal amount of wins/losses, and it will make sure this happens even if it has to put you against garbage enemies. The devs will argue that the teams are equally skilled, yet you will have matches where the enemy team can't get a single kill. The way Skill based matchmaking works is, it totals up the MMR of each individual to make up the teams MMR. So 4 crayon eaters with 500 mmr can equal 2000 MMR. You have a MMR of 3000, giving your team 5000 MMR. You go up against a team of 5 people who all individually have 1000 MMR. So you get stomped. Being forced to carry every game is exhausting, so the only way I found to enjoy it is to play casually and not try to win anymore (since it's out of my control). I might be able to force a win but then I will just get a loss streak following that because the game doesn't want me to win too many times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are comparing Takamura's fight with Hawk a champion, then that's a bad example because I never implied Ippo should stomp Ricardo. Gonzalez was the #2 boxer and with him out of the picture, the only real main fights would be Ricardo, Miyata  amp; Sendo. Some unknown low ranking fighter who just started boxing deserves to get stomped on to justify Ippo standing a chance against Ricardo. Takamura stomps anyone who isn't a champ, and it makes it that much more exciting when someone does give him trouble, then you know his opponent is the real deal. Meanwhile every Ippo fight is an uphill battle where his opponent dances on Ippo which is far more boring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't really see the excuse for people to not game on PC though? Don't you have a PC you use for stuff. I use my computer for programming, 3D modeling  amp; rendering, digital art, watching anime  amp; movies, etc. There should already be an investment on a PC, and it's just a matter of upgrading parts at that point. A PC is capable of doing many things. It doesn't really make sense to get a PS5 just so you can play 2 games early before they come on PC eventually. Meanwhile there's thousands of games on PC that aren't on playstation. and honestly the Playstation exclusives that might not come on PC are just movie games you can watch on youtube. I'm using a computer that's several years old, the only thing I am upgrading for this next gen is the GPU so it's not expensive. Playstation costs more in the long run with having to pay subscriptions and not getting all the 90% off discounts that PC gamers get. Also they are going to get fucked by $70 games while I pay $10 for an AAA game. There's PC bundles where you get like 20 good games for $10. It's cheaper. This isn't even taking in account for the better framerates, better graphics, modding abilities, the list goes on. You're pretty much paying $500+$70(+subscriptions) just so you can play spiderman a year before me, and once it comes on psnow it will only be like $5 for PC gamers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Using money as an argument doesn't work here because you still have to pay for subscriptions  amp; $70 games on PS5. 10 games for $700 is not something a poor person would do. 2. The exclusives like Horizon  amp; the new spiderman, etc. Have also been announced for PS4, a platform you already own. So if money was as tight as you said, it makes no sense to buy the new console. 3. Instead of paying $70 for a game you could be paying $5-10 on PC. (emulation  amp; other methods exist if money is really a concern.) 4. I don't understand why you say you rarely play indie games. They're not even all of the same quality. Heck, No Man's Sky is an indie game and I wouldn't compare that to something like Minecraft. Kingdom come deliverance is an indie game. All indie means is a game had little to no publisher involvement. You like Nier? They're now Indie. Since most of the playstation exclusives coming out on next gen, are also available on PS4. Getting a PC is better because of all the games you missed out on are going to be heavily discounted now. If you're going to get a PS5 it's probably best to wait till an actual exclusive comes out, cause so far almost all of them are going to be on PS4 too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It makes no sense to me to buy a gaming rig, or to even invest in a gaming rig that I have to constantly spend hundreds on to keep it up to date, 1. Depends on what you mean by up to date. Up to date as in you have the latest tech? if so, consoles are never up to date. Heck PS5 and the new xbox are already outdated by a GPU that came out **TWO YEARS AGO**. You're going to have to buy a PC if you want to be up to date on that technology. A computer that's 4 years old still runs games fine today even without updating. But new pc parts come out each year, you're not forced to buy them. 2. I have a gaming laptop that's 3 years old that doesn't have these issues. It runs all modern games without lag, also keep in mind that the PS4 dealt with performance issues so if you're trying to escape that with the PS5 keep your expectations low. 3. Triple A games are sold in bundles. I got MGSV definitive edition for $5 bundled with a ton of other games. Does metal gear solid V look like a mobile game to you? Yakuza is a mobile game? Tomb Raider games are mobile games now? Come on man. 4. I am not currently subscribed to gamepass. But I did temporarily subscribe to it for $5 and managed to finish multiple games start to finish, games I have no intention of ever replaying all for $5. It was a great value. For games I want to keep I can just optionally choose to buy the game.. Gamepass is entirely optional for me so how exactly is it a horrible model? You can still choose to buy and keep a game. But for me I was content with spending $5 to beat several games and even demo them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;go build a PC out of PS5/Xbox series x parts. I'll wait for you to tell me how much it costs. the parts from 2 years ago already surpass a PS5/series X. I guess building from scratch would cost a little more, but upgrading a 5 year old PC to surpass it would cost me $500. I actually spend less since I saved money not having to pay for playstation subscription. Also, you act like this price tag even matters when on PS5/Xbox you have to pay for the console + subscription + $70 game. The cognitive dissonance is insane here. You want to argue that price helps determine the decision when PC is cheaper in the long run. $500 to upgrade an old gen PC into something that surpasses PS5.  gt;I'm glad it works for you. I have no interest in playing games once and then moving on to the next one. Your hatred for something is based on something you think will happen but hasn't happened. Also if you stop paying your console subscription you still get locked out of the multiplayer for your game. So you have serious bias.  gt;Gaming laptops cost 600$+. $500 PS5 + subscription + $70 game, you're already above $600.  gt;Secondly, my internet connection SUCKS. This is the only good argument I seen you make on this. Although if you had a gaming laptop you can just bring it to the library or another public space and download the game really quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>please don't say this, sendo realized in his fight that he can brace someones punch and hit them to exchange blows. I hope you didn't foreshadow that faceblocking counters Ricardo. It would also explain how Sendo managed to down him. Ricardo never expected someone to let him punch them as they do a suicide dive. I really doubt Sendo has a secret move he didn't show us. Meaning it's something we already seen Sendo do that worked on Ricardo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. A low-end PC can run PS5 exclusives. Steam has statistics that show what kind of PC most gamers have, and most PC gamers own a graphics card from 4 years ago. Death Stranding  amp; horizon Zero Dawn run on computers from 7 years ago. $100 gpu, $10 fans, $25 ram, $40 power supply, etc. (You just won't get ultra graphics, 4K + 120 FPS at 144hz) 2. Sony releases their exclusives on PC or they let you play them through PSnow. I played spiderman  amp; god of war for $5 through psnow. Technically you can play games on PSnow even with a $70 laptop on craigslist. 3. It depends on the game when it comes to prices. Sometimes they show up $10-15, or if they were recent (like death stranding) they show up full price. but Death Stranding immediately had a sale weeks later.  gt; Also, smaller indie games seem to be the biggest part of "thousands of exclusives" from what I've seen, so that comment isn't necessarily aimed at bigger titles like no man's sky, which i also didn't play. 4. The indie argument makes no sense regardless, why are you judging a game based on if it's indie? Indie does not reflect the quality of the game. 5. Emulation hasn't started with PS5 yet, they're working on PS4 but there's really no demand for it since the playstation games come to PC anyway. Why emulate PS4 if you can already play their games (except the royal version of persona and DREAMS) Something I don't understand is if you're concerned with price points how come you're okay with buying $70 games? Also what about "big" games are you so concerned about? Being indie or not doesn't reflect the quality of a game. Or if you're just trying to get the games with the best graphics, then why not go on PC where it has higher graphic settings, better FPS, 144 hz at higher resolutions. Lastly, I'm sure there's countless games you would love that you haven't played yet, that came out years ago that are now discounted. By the time you finish those games, the newer games would already be on sale on PC, which is the approach I take. If someone is trying to be cost effective, then they wouldn't buy $70 games or get a subscription. It's strange to say price matters but then go for the more expensive option in the long run. When tomb raider came out on PC, the next month it was discounted 75% off. Why buy it on release date if you care about price.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also there's other things to consider. 1. a $1k PC gives you better graphics, 1080p/1440p at 144hz 60+ fps. ultra settings for a better experience on AAA games. Also if all the gens keep repeating their self, that $1k PC is going to be stronger than the PS6 when it comes out making you futureproof. 2. an all-in-one for playing every console(except ps4) including the switch. We only missed out on 2 games that are going to eventually come to the PC. 3. You can do other things than play a game on PC. 4. Modding capability, you can improve games and fix anything you don't like about them. I get a better gaming experience because I can tweak games to exactly how I like them. Witcher 3 weight limit mod was a godsend. MGSV has a mod that lets you tweak every aspect to the game to your liking to make it way more exciting to play. 5. Portability with my gaming laptop 6. Consoles have to deal with frame drops, shitty 30 FPS and upscaled 720p while paying more long-term for worse graphics. After a year of buying games on PS5 you will already have spent more than it'd cost for a PC that's more than twice as strong as a PS5. 7. Bigger variety of games, we got access to plenty of genres that aren't accessible on consoles. (I love moba's  amp; strategy games which aren't available on playstation) 8. Hacking capabilities. All online multiplayer games can be modified into having split screen support thanks to nucleuscoop. We can go into the game files and make unreleased content available and fix bugs ourself instead of waiting for a developer to do something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just play the games for the story + roleplaying aspects. There are other games with much better combat systems but dragon age origin's choices  amp; story makes up for all the flaws...It is so fucking good that if the game was a walking simulator with the same amount of choices  amp; story I'd STILL buy the game. I want bioware to focus on what they do best and not try to waste resources on.. * Multiplayer (that gets abandoned a month after release) * Backtracking back and forth through the world wasting hours of my life just going from point A to point B. * Crafting System * Collecting items, running around the world to grab stupid shit and go off a checklist * Waiting on the stupid wartable before you can continue * Busywork, fetch quests and stuff like"kill 5 boars" The long development time has me worried that they're trying to force a ton of unnecessary mechanics again. I really don't want to waste my time on low quality mmo-tier quests just for the sake of extending playtime. Please don't pad out the game. I want a great story start to finish, I don't want to deal with good story for 1 hour, but 6 hours of grinding and grabbing collectibles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ricardo's jabs is just one layer to his boxing style. Ippo can still use defense to get around Ricardo's right and any other tricks he may have. Ricardo is like a boss fight with multiple forms, and people can't even get past his first stage. If you shut down Ricardo's left, he will use a different strategy and maybe defense could work on that strategy. Right now the most important thing is shutting down his left, and standing there blocking/dodging does not shut down the left in any way. Ippo already said being reactive lets your opponent control the match. The left controls the world. If Ippo stops Ricardo's left by standing there blocking, then this billy fight is pointless. Sendo downing Ricardo is pointless. Sendo vs Gonzalez ends up being pointless and so many conversations in the series become pointless. Why would Morikawa foreshadow all of this if standing there blocking counters his jabs? I haven't even seen you guys explain how blocking is going to stop Ricardo's jabs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;He sparred Ippo, chose not to spar him any longer because Ippo was hurt. When he spars he doesn't go all out He already won the fight why does he have to kill Ippo, I don't see why it's not going all out?  gt;Ricardo always unleashes his right in round 2, and he didn't against Sendo. So stop coming up with loads of bullshit to tell your narrative. He was beating Sendo with his left, why would he use his right? Going all out doesn't mean you just throw every attack for the sake of it. He's calculated and has his right saved for a counter. If he just spams his right with no reason behind doing it, it could make him vulnerable. He takes fights seriously. He's not like Ippo who just goes straight into a dempsey roll. Ricardo does what's necessary to win instead of just throwing random punches.  gt;He didn't try against Sendo okay? That goes against his character, he doesn't want to disrespect boxing. You're making up so much bullshit that has nothing backing any of it and contradicts everything Ricardo said. Even when Ricardo tells you himself you still believe stupid bullshit and can't even read.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand why people hate it but it is definitely the central narrative of this series. We even had it happen on sendo vs the #2 boxer. And it's now being foreshadowed with Ricardo wishing his fights were more exciting. A yamato damashi might give Ricardo the best fight of his life. (Although I know the people on this subreddit are going to be mad af when it happens. They're still in a denial stage about it even though we went through over 2 decades of this narrative) It also doesn't help that this series is called Ippo's fighting spirit.</TEXT>

Gonzalez was going to that spar for a serious match. Ippo took his spar against Ricardo seriously. You're making baseless assumptions that contradict everything we seen so far. If you're going to continue with this shit you pull out your ass, then please tell me where Ricardo said he isn't going to take the spar seriously? Heck, even his coach told him to crush Ippo and show him what the world champion is like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First I love how you cut out the context that caused him to do this. It shows how desperate you gotten. Dates goal was to avoid Ricardo from getting into the rhythm that causes him to dominate a match and turn it into a one sided fight. Dates boxing suppressed Ricardo to where he had no choice but to change styles, Date adapted to it and came up with a game plan for it and so for Ricardo to get control of the match again he changed style. That doesn't make the other style him "going all out". Ricardo is still the guy who uses the best strategy based on what's happening in a match. And since he's defeating people with jabs I'm not sure how you can argue he's not taking the fights seriously when he's using the most effective strategy. Date was about figuring out Ricardo's timing and coming up with a counterplan. Using punches that don't have a pattern to them countered Date but that doesn't mean it's going to be more effective than his other style in other contexts. For Example if Ricardo was stupid and used metzli mode against someone with more power than him and they began trading blows. He'd get fucked, he's smart for not doing that shit on Sendo's specialty. You're acting like boxing has no strategy now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HAHAHAHA THE LINK YOU SENT ME JUST PROVED MY STATEMENT. You are an idiot who thinks this is DBZ with power levels  gt;the combination of science and violence. That is ricardo martinez, and that is the greatest style in the world. It literally TELLS YOU that Ricardo combines 2 things into one style. Also go watch Naruto if you believe in stupid power levels.  #128514; You somehow think that if Ricardo switches to metzli mode it's a power-up. Ricardo has 2 methods combined into one style, to beat Ricardo requires someone to be able to beat both of them. an Improved Ippo could beat Metzli mode but he needs to find out how to even get past Ricardo's other method which is why he's undefeated. Even if someone could counter 1 style they lose to the other one. But people like you think this is DBZ where Ricardo can go super saiyan and just wildly swing at people and win regardless of context.  #128514; Since this is too complex for you to understand. Metzli mode counters boxers like Date, and his other style counters heavy hitters like Ippo/Sendo and defensive fighters like Billy. You SERIOUSLY believe that there's no strategy and that Ricardo can just wildly swing at people because his power level is higher. No. Metzli mode just counters people who aren't heavy hitters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ricardo has 2 styles which was shown in his date fight. His coach says he combines science with violence. He has the violent metzli mode, and his scientific approach where he predicts everything someone is going to do and comes up with a plan to stop it. Date managed to take down the science side to Ricardo but didn't have a plan for dealing with his Metzli mode. It's possible that an improved Ippo can handle Metzli mode but he'll need to come up with a strategy to take down the other style Ricardo has. If Sendo does end up fighting against Ricardo, I think Morikawa is going to show us exactly *why* Ricardo is undefeated. To do that would require Sendo figuring out the weakness to one style and then getting slaughtered by the other style. And I think that's because both of his styles counter 2 different types of boxers. His science side defeats heavy hitters like Ippo/Sendo and reactive boxers like Billy. his metzli mode defeats suppressive/tactical boxers like Date. Someone would need to find a way to combine both offense with defense to handle both styles and that might be the direction Morikawa is going with the dempsey roll.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After some thinking on it, he might not really beat Ricardo. Ricardo has 2 styles as shown in the fight against Date. His coach says he combines science with violence. For someone to beat Ricardo would require them to be able to counter both his aggressive metzli mode and also his more scientific approach to boxing. His scientific approach has been shown to take down heavy hitters or more reactive boxers like billy. But we don't know yet if his Metzli Mode can stack up to an improved Ippo or if Sendo can handle his Metzli mode. But so far the Metzli mode has been proven to take out boxing styles like Date. Date came in with a game plan, a strategy to prevent Ricardo from dominating the match with his left jab  amp; counter style but then got demolished when it was revealed that Ricardo also has a second way of fighting. I think narratively it would make sense if Sendo lost to his Metzli mode, because that would give Sendo a satisfying fight, instead of just losing to basic jabs. Sendo kept complaining about how they're not fighting like real men and Ricardo revealed that his real self would actually match Sendo's expectations. Although this makes me think Sendo is going to retire after losing because he will finally get the fight he wanted. TL;DR.. Sendo can beat Ricardo's first style but lose to Metzli mode. Just because he found a weakness for one style doesn't mean he can beat both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I know what Sendo's fight is supposed to show us. In Date's fight his coach said that Ricardo combines science with violence. Date found a gameplan to counter Ricardo's science side then got bodied by the violent side. I think Sendo vs Ricardo is going to show us that even if you come up with a way to beat one style, you can't defeat ricardo till you can find a way through both sides of him. This is why his coach said that Ricardo has the ultimate style in boxing. (His scientific side with the jabs  amp; counters completely stops heavy hitters like Ippo/Sendo  amp; defensive boxers like Billy) his violent side destroys people like Date who found a way through his jabs. This is also foreshadowed because Sendo keeps complaining about them not fighting like real men, so I bet you that Sendo is going to get his wish granted and get to go up against Metzli Ricardo. Although that might grant him his dream fight which leads to Sendo retiring after. Also Dempsey Roll might become important for Metzli mode since it combines defense with offense. Ippo just needs to learn how to deal with those jabs. This also explains why Ricardo is so undefeated, he has a strategy for all types of boxers.</TEXT>

I know that makes people skeptical it's going to suck. But this ended up being better than game of thrones in ever way possible for me. Not just that, but it was a unique experience that gave me a special kind of immersion that nothing else has ever done for me. The puppets actually enhanced the story  amp; world because it really did feel like it was a unique world from anything else out there. It sucks that it didn't flop because of its writing or anything like that. The only reason it failed was because the puppets made people not want to try it.</TEXT>

I checked the post history and found out he's been using the same group of accounts for YEARS on all different kinds of subreddits. There are moments where he makes a thread, and he defends himself on his alternate accounts. He uses vote manipulation to get himself to the top of the comments, etc. But the problem is he made it *obvious* by leaving his post history up instead of deleting it. So you could easily see a pattern of it going on. An account that is ONLY used to agree with him and defend him for example. I told him if he's going to do something like that, he should've been smart enough to delete his post history. (Which he started doing after I said that, and he went silent and left the thread afterwards.) Now that he deleted his posts people don't know what happened.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not to change netflix decision. The team who worked on dark crystal are probably trying to see what their options are, as long as we show there's a huge interest in the series, then it helps them negotiate. Maybe another company will pick up dark crystal from netflix, or maybe they have options we don't know about such as maybe they can buy the license off netflix but they need money, etc. Showing that you want the series to continue helps the creators more than you can imagine. If we just stay quiet, then people will go "See, no one gives a fuck about it. It's not worth the investment"</TEXT>

Disgaea and other games have cheese tactics for leveling up that do not require you to work hard, just mindlessly repeat the same strat. JRPG's in general lets you kill slimes over and over by picking the same move till you eventually overlevel content. Calling it toil is an exaggeration  amp; dishonest.

    <TEXT>Then Morikawa would've showed us by now that defense can work against Ricardo. Heck even Date had to use yamato damashi and that's what ultimately countered Ricardo.. When Date said that he will let Ricardo break as many bones in his body in exchange for his life. That was the exact moment when Date was finally able to land the heartbreak shot (although he didn't have power) Before Date fully committed his own safety to do the punch, he kept failing. So..Morikawa already showed us the suicidal fighting spirit works against Ricardo. (Then you have sendo down Ricardo in their spar even) Billy loses a one sided match when he tried to focus on defense. I can understand why you hate this outcome, but it's really leading towards it. Edit: to add to this. Ippo's defense can still be relevant since Ricardo still has metzli mode. We don't know yet what the counter to metzli mode is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Dempsey Roll is saved for his metzli mode. We still don't know how to counter Ricardo's metzli mode. In Ricardo vs Date fight, Ricardo's coach said that Ricardo has the ultimate boxing style because it combines science (what he uses against billy/sendo/ippo) with violence (metzli). To beat Ricardo requires you to beat both his styles, and the reason it's the ultimate boxing style is because Date had a gameplan to counter his science side only to get bodied by the violent side. Even if someone can beat Ricardo's metzli mode, that doesn't mean they can beat his other style. Ricardo combining both of these allows him to handle all types of boxers. Science side beats defensive boxers like Billy  amp; heavy hitters like ippo/sendo. Metzli mode defeats suppressive boxers like Date who managed to slip in through his offense. I got a huge feeling dempsey roll is saved for metzli mode.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The shin megami imagine online private server is going to start fresh next week, so I'm going to be playing with that. I have no problem enjoying MMORPG's because I play on private servers with friends. You only need a handful of friends to enjoy a MMO imo and on private servers we don't have to deal with cash shops or anything like that. I also don't have the issues anyone on this subreddit has with "endgame". me and my group of friends play a MMORPG start to finish on a private server then move to the next MMO before it burns us out, so we always end them on a high note. Private servers have faster progression so we're not stuck spamming the same dungeon over and over for months, making it more of an adventure to clear every dungeon in the game with just a small group.</TEXT>

Heck people can just go "I find X game to be boring, therefore downvoted" I only exclusively play on private servers so I don't run into these issues. I enjoy many games that have horrible public servers, because I play on private servers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you're saying makes so much damn sense and it's sad. Basically Nakaba *accidentally* found a winning formula for an interesting series, but he doesn't even understand why his own series was as popular as it was. It's either that or after a certain point he made it up as he went to prolong the story. I genuinely believe Nanatsu was fine early on before power levels were introduced. We could tell how strong people were based on feats alone, and left things to our imagination. The series was pretty hype seeing them do ridiculous things, and then after a point he said fuck it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bladestorm nightmare is one of their best games, the main problem I have with it is that it doesn't go on sale, if you could get it for $10 or less it's worth it. The problem with open world is they are doing it in a way that doesn't enhance the experience in any way. Bladestorm nightmare became open world for the sake of giving battles more depth. It is the ideal setting for an empires game, definitely worth playing. The battles are larger scale than any dynasty warriors game and it even lets you create a character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What will they have to do to make Tekken 8 worth playing over 7? Because we all know that if a Tekken 8 comes out, we're going to be starting with a small roster all over again, your favorite character might not be available on launch and could take potentially years for them to return. I'm really wondering how next gen fighting games are going to be worth playing. Usually massive graphical changes and fixing the flaws of the previous game is enough to move the fanbase over, but I don't think there's going to be a big jump from 7 to 8.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A flat barren land that you have to spend 20 minutes traveling before you can get to the action again. Please tell me how that will enhance empires gameplay, because this community suddenly went on a 180 and is now defending it. Let me know how having fishing elements, hunting rabbits and other nonsense would enhance an empires game. I'm glad they are not going to waste development time on it, and instead we'll get MAPS again with decent level design. DW9 did not have meaningful level design, it was just some open world map with units dropped on top of it. It had to go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; or why some ppl like MGS V  #8212; most ppl saw boring empty space, I saw natural empty space meant to plan give freedom of maneuverability in your approach That was able to exist without the open world. The previous metal gear solid games and even ground zeroes proved this. In fact a lot of people would argue there was more flexibility in ground zeroes than phantom pain in how to do a mission. The open world caused them to use up developmental resources at the sacrifice of the games narrative  amp; level design. Open world usually comes at the sacrifice of level design or other aspects. MGSV had plenty of shallow places where it's just houses placed together, the open world didn't add to it. There was way more depth to ground zeroes and a lot of the missions in MGSV felt shallow and padded out and in the end people argued we got half a game because of it. Also in games like inquisition  amp; DW9 in an attempt to make the open world not feel pointless they add filler content, fetch quests and stuff like hunting rabbits and other chores.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You still don't understand. his coach LITERALLY said his ultimate style was combining the old style with the new scientific method. He combines them. Anyone who manages to get past his jabs and counters gets beaten by his metzli mode, it's not his "old" style, it's his current style to switch to metzli to obliterate people who get past his jabs  amp; counters. Metzli isn't his "best" style, it's literally just a mode he switches to when the other one doesn't work. If he was stupid enough to switch to metzli mode from the start against someone like Sendo, then he'd actually give Sendo a fighting chance because that's Sendo's specialty. His science side obliterates the fuck out of Sendo and is far more superior for dealing with in boxers like Sendo  amp; Ippo. His Metzli mode is more effective at taking out people like Date, Date can't handle that kind of ruthless boxing but stands a decent chance against the jabs  amp; counters. That was the whole point to the date vs Ricardo match. Was to show that even if you can beat 1 style, you can't beat Ricardo till you can counter both strategies. If Ricardo just used his metzli mode for every fight, then some boxers would actually stand a chance against him. His coach said what makes Ricardo unbeatable is that he has 2 styles combined into one making it impossible to counter him. If anyone thinks Metzli is stronger than his science style, then they didn't understand the point to the date fight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;his natural/most powerful form is somewhat of a brawl This isn't fully true. His coach said that the ultimate form of boxing is when Ricardo combines metzli mode with his science. This means you are already seeing Ricardo's most powerful form against billy. Ricardo has 2 styles combined into one. Date came in with a game plan to counter Ricardo's scientific style of boxing, and then Ricardo switched to metzli mode. A form that Date had no gameplan for going against and then he got the shit beaten out of him. No style is weaker than the other, they both compensate for the others weakness. His science style is effective against defensive/reactive boxers like Billy, and completely counters in boxers like Ippo  amp; Sendo. His Metzli/Violent mode counters suppressive boxers like Date who managed to counter his science style. When Ricardo's coach said that the ultimate style of boxing is combining these 2 he meant that Ricardo can just switch styles based on who he's fighting. For example when he's fighting against Sendo it would be completely stupid if Ricardo starts the fight with Metzli mode, because that gives Sendo a chance to actually hurt him. Meanwhile Sendo can't do anything against Ricardos jabs  amp; counters. The WHOLE point to dates fight wasn't to say that Ricardo has a super saiyan form he can tap into whenever he's losing. It was to say that to beat Ricardo requires you to learn how to deal with both of his styles and not just one. Why do you think Gonzalez thought he could beat Ricardo? Because Gonzalez had his own Metzli for dealing with Ricardo's metzli, and he was also a more calculative boxer for handling Ricardo's jabs  amp; counters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hah I'm joking. They already foreshadowed exactly how Sendo  amp; Ippo's fight is going to go through Date's fight. In Date's fight Ricardo's coach said that Ricardo combines science with violence. Date found a gameplan to counter Ricardo's science side then got bodied by the violent(metzli) side. I think Sendo vs Ricardo is going to show us that even if you come up with a way to beat one style, you can't defeat ricardo till you can find a way through both sides of him. This is why his coach said that Ricardo has the ultimate style in boxing. (His scientific side with the jabs  amp; counters completely stops heavy hitters like Ippo/Sendo  amp; defensive boxers like Billy) his violent(metzli) side destroys people like Date who found a way through his jabs. This is also foreshadowed because Sendo keeps complaining about them not fighting like real men, so I bet you that Sendo is going to get his wish granted and get to go up against Metzli Ricardo after finding a way through his science side. Ricardo vs Sendo is not going to be an awful fight, Sendo's loss won't be in vain. It's supposed to show Ippo how to beat 1 style while giving Sendo his dream fight giving him closure. It's also why Morikawa gave Ippo the dempsey roll since it combines defense with offense and is going to be crucial for their fight. The reason why Ricardo is undefeated is because he has a strategy for all types of boxers. By switching styles to one that counters the boxer he's facing he is able to remain undefeated. This was also foreshadowed with Gonzalez. The reason why Gonzalez thought he could be Ricardo is because he learned to develop 2 styles to fighting. He has a metzli form to deal with Ricardo's Metzli and he also has his own scientific approach to boxing to deal with Ricardo's jabs  amp; counters. There' so much foreshadowing to Ricardo I can't fit it all in one comment.</TEXT>

Some people think their opinions are fact, so you could actually end up ruining a good character by letting someone convince you that they're bad. I don't think any character is safe from opinions. One of my favorite characters Subaru has tons of people saying he's bad because of his flaws. But his flaws are why I like him because it's giving me a unique experience I haven't gotten from any other series. Watching a character make the worst decisions is way more original than I thought it'd be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the real problem I have with rape is that you can get the message across without resorting to it. You can show someone is evil without there being rape. Also rape is very disrespectful to the victim. I'm not saying murder is okay but rape is very VERY unnecessary in a lot of contexts. I found it to be acceptable in Berserk since it's important to the narrative and one of the plot devices that's been foreshadowed reveals there is no other way they could've handled it. When I see rape in a story that's done to show that someone is evil it just looks like despair porn to me, like the author gets off on the fact that the woman is getting humiliated and disrespected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because rape is preventable in most cases, the writer wants to show how evil a character is. There's countless ways to do it. Them choosing to pick rape out of all their options just seems like the author gets off to watching women getting humiliated and disrespected. It just seems like an over the top way of getting a message across to the point that I have to question the writers intentions. I'm also bothered by unnecessary humiliating deaths that some characters get too. Like imagine if you had to sit through 15 minutes of Tony stark watching his family get tortured in front of him, he watches his daughters eyeballs get pulled out of their sockets with a spoon as she gets each limb cut off in the most painful ways imaginable. Then his wife gets eaten alive by animals, and then Tony gets tortured next.. Seems really over the top doesn't it? You can get the same message across by just having Tony watch someone shoot his family and then he gets killed after. Rape just seems like the writer is going the extra mile to harm a character if it doesn't add to the narrative/plot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Miyata has a glass chin, and he's going up against a boxer with some of the most power in their weight division. IMO This means that if Miyata gets hit once the fight is over, so unless Morikawa chooses to make it a 1 page fight, I'm expecting Ippo to get slapped around unable to get a single punch in as Miyata lands counter after counter before finally getting that one punch in and Miyata is down and out for the count. It sounds terrible but how else is this fight going to go? How would you justify Miyata surviving a punch by Ippo if he's so fragile against other boxers?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not a guaranteed cure but there's tons of stories out there of it curing so many mental illnesses in people. Bipolar, Depression, etc. It cured my bipolar  amp; depression and now I have a firm belief that anyone who is actually going to commit suicide, should at least try this shit before they do it. I wonder how many lives would be saved if people did this. Edit: I want to clarify something. I am not recommending DMT to every suicidal person out there. I am suggesting it as a last resort. If you truly decided that you don't want to live anymore and you're going to go through with it. Then at least try this before you pull the trigger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not going to say that DMT is risk free, each person is different and yes there's a possibility of it making things worse for you. I only recommend it as a last resort. If you came to the conclusion that you're going to actually kill yourself. Then at that point the risks don't matter to you anymore. But for context I have been trying therapy  amp; medication for 20 years and none of the treatment has helped me. I was always suicidal. I then came to the conclusion that I don't want to continue being suicidal for the next 60 years of my life, and that's when I decided I was going to commit suicide. But before I did I decided to try some drugs and that's when DMT saved me. ----  gt;I mean, for people really suicidal (again, not my current case), giving them the feeling that you0ll become one with the universe once you die... Wouldn't it be a calling to end it all more than to endure life? Oh boy you're going to be in for a crazy trip. It's not that you'll become one with the universe when you die. It's that you're already one with the universe. It's not something you'll understand till you take the drug. But when you realize it, suicide starts looking pointless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought the MX-r was good too but then I tried Phantoms Arren. With some practice that's the deadliest gun in the game for body shots at mid-long range. Yes she has a sniper that one hit kills on headshots. But only a select few people are consistent enough to get headshots nonstop. Even Shroud and other top players have most of their shots come from bodyshots. That Arren however, you can keep firing nonstop without hesitating, I am getting 30+ kills a game as phantom in strikeout now, and with her passive + tracker rounds she gets the enemy team revealed the whole match making it easy to line up headshots. Also with her evade perk + the ADS perk she can move at fast speeds while scoped letting her win any at any range, even close combat. It's close to sprinting speed when she strafes. Fire rate is practically as fast as you can click, amazing hipfire, etc. She beats Trench with that gun.</TEXT>

I feel like the drug amplifies your strongest emotion in a way. In your case, your biggest fear. Death can't scare me no matter how painful it is, so instead I got a different hallucination. One that would scare the piss out of me. I was hallucinating that I was reincarnating and that life is eternal even after death. Not exactly something a suicidal person wants to hear.</TEXT>

By improving his haki. * How does Luffy learn to deal with Kaido? By improving his haki. It Reminds me of Ichigo's bankai which is known for its speed only for all his enemies to be just as fast or faster than him meaning he has no bankai.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are missing out on something actually. A lot of men become a lot more attached to their first partners if they met them later in life, and this causes them to become an emotional wreck when that person dumps them or cheats on them. Someone who has more experience with a bunch of different partners would become more jaded when it comes to being cheated on or going through a break up. The longer they wait, the more their head gets filled with this fantasy of what a relationship is. I know some people who can't get over a break-up even 10 years later. People need to go through the motions instead of just listening to strangers on the internet tell them what it's like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Luffy not having a weapon makes it impossible for him to ever be strong enough to beat mihawk. If Luffy throws any attack at Mihawk then Mihawk can just cut his arm off and Luffy is screwed. Luffy can't even block Mihawks attack. Kaido proved that Haki can just ignore Luffy's entire gear 4. So Mihawk can one shot Luffy no matter how hard he tries. Unless luffy picks up a weapon he can't block or stop Mihawks sword.</TEXT>
