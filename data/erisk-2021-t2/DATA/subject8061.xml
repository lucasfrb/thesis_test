    <TEXT>I've been replaying the wedding of hammerlock DLC recently and really like the anachy shotgun, i got a fire damage one with consecutive hits anointment, together with the pearl of knowledge it really rips through mayhem 10 enemies in the DLC (if you get the stacks going), its a fun changeup from the hellwalker. I do keep blowing myself up with the reload explosions though, so watch out for those or play flak. Koas AR is fun too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>haha yeah i just noticed the enemy voicelines when i started a new playthrough as amara today, didnt notice on my first or second playthrough with moze  amp; flak, i thought that was a really nice little addition. So i agree it would be fun to see more personalized responses, and im always down for more backstory. Maybe the'll ad something in with the release of the fourth skill tree coming soon, makes sense to me there needs to be more lore then! Flak meeting his new pet other charracters unlocking new abilitys too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i like the red tree the best rakk attack is an amazing ability, especially later on when you can trigger anointments easyly by using your rakk attack charges. Green tree is great too, the perk that lets your pet revive you is super usefull i didnt really go into the blue tree seemed less fun to me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk slowly go up to mayhem 10 by farming some bosses and the different takedowns, find all red chests, perfecting your builds / items, do the eridian trials with all the optional objectives, unlocking all the badass perks, getting a 100% on all maps, trying to get all the achievements, completing all the arena's on MH10 with all optional objectives, start a new charracter, unlock all the cosmetics, unlock all the vehicle skins and parts, challenge yourself make up a challenge and see if you can do it like complete a takedown using only blue rarity with redtext items? TLDR: Theres lots to do!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I currently have 3 vaulthunters at lvl 65 MH10 with fun builds, and are debating getting started on my last and 4th vaulthunter: Zane but find myself wanting a bit of a challenge for this one, seeing as i have completed the game multiple times. So what are some fun challenges you guys can come up with / would recommend for a 4th playthrough? All suggestions are welcome!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im sure the new skilltrees will be fun, the new gamemode is a big maybe to me, its just that the wording, designers and directorscut don't inspire much confidence or value to me. Still thx for your input!</TEXT>
