    <TITLE>about the black lives matter discussion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-15 15:34:52</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8203; this thing is going to be long, and please read the whole thing before commenting y'all probably know that a 5 year old (white) kid got executed by a (black) man. the reason the skin color is in between brackets is because that color shouldn't matter yet it matters (apparently) i agree that black lives matter, just as much as white, asian and any other existing race. some things about this whole discussion don't add up and make no sense. \-i've seen pictures and video's of white people demonstrating for black lives / against police brutality and then putting their middle fingers up against a black cop. \-people who clean a federal building (Black Lives Matter was paintetd on the building) got called racist just for cleaning the building. (they were just cleaning not being racist) \-and now on top of all this nonsense this 5 year old kid gets shot by a man and people on twitter are litteraly saying: "blew his little white privileged brains clean out of his head #blacklivesmatter" and "ion give a shit he's white it's time for revenge we tired shit over with now we shootitng y'all go cry to yo mama" (i know this is bad use of the black lives matter hashtag). these people use the black lives matter discussion in a wrong way i know that but what it does is giving people an excuse too hate black lives matter. and to change things it needs to be accepted and there needs to be real change and that's hard. but the change y'all want with defend the police: that's not going to work. let me explain that: when you give the police less money there will not be enough money for training, body cams and non-lethal equipment such as a taser. the police officer will grab his gun way faster in situations. if you want too really change things as a white person, start a conversation with a reasonable black person and ask what things you can do to really change things in a way that makes sense if you're black and want things change, do your research and make a well thought out plan that can contribute to change and try to talk to local polilticians about it. my advice would be start an organisation that fights (political) for change. make it well organized and if someone uses the black lives matter thing wrong like when this boy got killed, make a statement as an organisation that you don't approve such things. to close this off: if you see a video on twitter or somewhere else, please don't scream police brutality right away, do your research because a lot of these video's are only the moment the police shoots or the story that's told with it is wrong (a youtuber who explains these things in a very clear and good way is DonutOperator).  #8203; y'all i hope you have a nice day and try to stay positive in life because even if things don't look too nice right now everything can change</TEXT>

    <TEXT>he shouldn't have been there with that gun, it was illegal for him to have that gun. in my opinion he used it perfectly fine, the first one grabs for his gun so he shoots him: self defense. than he had to run away and falls, people were shouting to get him so he already was in a nasty situation. then multiple people jump him, 1 hits him with a skateboard and tries to grab his gun and gets shot: self defense. than there's a guy with a pistol who puts his hands up and seems to make a forward motion with his hands he gets shot, wounded not dead: self defense and at least 2 of the shot persons had a done some bad things (1st person, sex offender or something like that) they should just drop those charges (for murder and idk what the thing for third person was) and keep it to the weapon possession things. donut operator breaks things down pretty damn good. so watch his videos on this if you want a more detailed break down</TEXT>

    <TEXT>that last paragraph is exactly how it is for me, got bullied by people i consider friends. when everyone made friends is was like totally turned into myself and now I'm lonely af. and that part of people everyone wants to talk to, i also relate to that, it seems like people don't really care what I've got to say. i cope with loneliness by listening to podcasts, music, working out, gaming. just keeping myself busy so i can't really think about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>19 years ago the lives of many men and women were changed by a sudden act of terror, we cannot forget the sacrifices men and women made on this day 19 years ago by running to the fire, to save people even though they probably knew it was gonna be an impossible task. we need to remember and can't forget. 2977 people died that day, including 343 firefighters 8 years ago the diplomatic outpost in benghazi was attacked, local security ran away but the contractors from a cia compound just a few miles away decided to go and try to save the ambassador against orders. they failed, the ambassador died. later that day the CIA compound got attacked, 3 men died trying to defend that compound. a total of 4 men died that day. i know no one of us doesn't remember 9/11 consciously, many of us weren't even born and probably no one remembers benghazi consciously. but we can't forget and need to remember the sacrifices people made those days and the amount of innocent people died that day.

    <TEXT>i love the dark and edgy humor, it's great. but you don't go around making 9/11 jokes on 9/11. many people died that day sacrificing their life to at least try to save the lives of others. and it makes me mad, today you remember the people that sacrificed their life or if it isn't important to you, shut the fck up and ignore it. and yes i make jokes about countless things including 9/11 but on this day, no i don't do that, it's over the edge. i decided to write this after another post telling to stop with the jokes, I'm not an American.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>pls kindly fck off with "i don't have a skirt but" and "look it's me in a skirt". first of all every 5 posts there's something with that in the title. second i think I've got an unpopular opinion so if you're easily offended, don't read it why the hell does everything have to be gender neutral, like clothes have gender, and it's good that way. i hate that everything needs to be neutral, fck off, how are you going to have masculine man that way because in my perception "neutral" means more feminine leaning than really neutral. i can go on for another hour about this society becoming easily offended, scared pieces of meat.</TEXT>
