    <TEXT>This deck is working really well for me at the moment, I'm still learning the finesses of it and will probably reach even higher trophies in the near future. If anyone is interested in a strategy for it I would be happy to share!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Start of the game: I will preferably start the game with a tombstone in the middle, if this is not available I will start a giant or executioner in the back. Offense: In single elixir time you are somewhat limited in what you can put down on your push, i prefer a straight up giant executioner. The graveyard is tricky since I wil only use it when I have enough elixir to place it and have a backup spell. Double elixir time is where this deck really shines. You can put the giant with the executioner down, put a mega minion with him and have enough elixir for a graveyard and a tornado. Defense: This deck is quite strong defensively, and if you run into defensive trouble you can start using the executioner tornado combo on defense, to take out almost every push. Remember to put a giant in front after your defense to force a reaction from your opponent. Card roles: -Giant: The not so friendly giant is the tank of this deck, use him to start pushes and tank for your graveyard. He is a formidable danger to the towers even without the graveyard. Graveyard: Your main win condition. This spell can shred a tower in mere seconds when tanked for. This card should be used only when positive you have enough elixir to take out your opponents counters to the graveyard, usually with the executioner tornado combo. Can be used defensively as a last resort but I don't recommend it. Executioner: The most OP card in the game right now. Destroys everything and is brilliant on defense as well as offense. If the game is not going your way you use this guy to defend and then start a counter. If your opponent has a hard counter like a knight, valkyrie or mini pekka don't ever play him without being able to use tornado to pull them away from him. Tornado: A high skill card that is deadly when used right in combination with the executioner. Use this to activate your king tower, pull troops to the middle and in combination with the executioner. When using it on offense you need to make sure that you pull the troops in a fashion that allows the axe of executioner to clip the tower as well, dealing a lot of tower damage while killing your enemies troops. Mega Minion: Mainly your defensive card, can be used to guard the executioner as well. Is capable of taking out an executioner if played well Skarmy: Use this defensively against basically everything, only real problem against them is the executioner, and mix up placement to prevent prediction spells. Tombstone: Defensive building, use it to pull troops toward the middle, and help take them out. Zap: Use it zap squishy troops, reset inferno's, and for the occasional re target. Extra tip, in a few games where my executioner kept being rocketed I held off on using him with push, but this was a big problem because my opponent had a minion horde to counter the graveyard. I have since found out that a zap tornado works wonders for minions as well, and is really unexpected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the Prince is massively underpowerd, especially if you compare them to cards like elite barbarians and mini pekka. He isn't as good defensively and not much better attacking. To buff the Prince I would give him a faster attack speed but slighty lower hit damage.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am not having fun.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-08 20:06:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was extremely excited for the release of Master Mirror and played a lot of Wild Hunt on the release day. Since the first days I have barely played the game though. It feels like almost every game I play is against the same Skellige deck and I feel I have almost no chance of winning. The only counter seems to be playing another Skellige deck or a specific counter deck. I was just looking forward to trying out the new decks like Wild Hunt, but losing every game is not fun to me. I just hope the next patch comes soon. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to vent somewhere!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I use Divinity Unleashed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-09 10:24:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am now playing the game for the first time (have just defeated the shriekers and I now have to fight the magisters). But I do kind of really dislike the armour system, as I feel it really limits the kind of builds you can make with your team. I would really like to play a hybrid team with 2 warriors and 2 mages but that feels extremely awkward with the physical and magical armour ratings. Is Divinity Unleashed a good "fix"? Or is it really not recommended for first time players? Thanks in advance!!</TEXT>
