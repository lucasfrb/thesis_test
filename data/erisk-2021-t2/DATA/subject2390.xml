    <TITLE>HxH is special to many for many reasons, but I realized one thing that it has done that NO other work of fiction has for me.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-12 08:28:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love HxH with all my heart, and there are so many things about the series that resonate with me. But in rewatching the anime, I came to realize something that really set it apart from everything else. I see myself as an amateur writer; even though my skill is not very great this mindset has kept me engaged in stories my entire life. As far back as I can remember, I've had myself wrapped up in some work of fiction. And through all of that none of them- no literature, visual media, comic, or any other form of a fictional story has EVER made me cry at the death of a "villain"... until Hunter X Hunter, of course. I've found antagonists and the like to be compelling, understandable, even love-able in the past, but no book or film has ever caused me to become so moved by them that I shed a tear at their passing. And that is something that HxH has done for me. I know this isn't really that big of a deal for any of you reading this, and not really something that surprises even me... but just realizing this and seeing the fact of it really added to my appreciation for this story... Meruem was an amazing character, and Hunter X Hunter will always be very special to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers Extended] A closer look at the consistency of quality in "Game of Thrones", from season one up until now.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-24 12:45:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Obviously many think Game of Thrones has dipped in quality lately. This post is just my review and analysis of each season's quality. I'm not here to hate on the show, nor to defend it really. I have no problem with either stance though so feel free to do either (while being civil of course). --- **If you want a TL;DR scroll to the bottom- to the section titled TOTAL REVIEW** --- Before I begin I just want to say that I am even now a big fan of the show, and even my least favorite season is more enjoyable to me than most everything else on tv. A bit obvious and everyone says that, but it holds very true. So, that said I'm going to go through each season chronologically starting from one and review my stance on the quality throughout the show. --- **PART ONE: THE GOOD 'OL DAYS (seasons 1-3)** **Season One:** One may not be my favorite season but I think it is objectively one of the best; being the most faithful to the source material helps, I think. But as a first season in general, it does a great job of introducing everything, especially for a story so large. Everything that eventually made everyone fall in love with the show was there... from the gritty realism and intricacy of the plot to the large world and spread of characters. Add in an excellent cast of dramatic actors and this show broke new ground for live action fantasy. This is where I can nitpick a bit, though. Early on some of the cast were not at their best due to inexperience or just not being extremely comfortable on the show. One example is Kit Harrington; he wasn't "bad", and I love him in later seasons... I think the role was written very generic in season one, and his acting style can be underwhelming in a typical somber protagonist like that. There were a few actors like that in season one though, and just like Kit most of them grew into their respective roles very well as they developed. The acting wasn't the only thing a bit rusty in season one. It honestly felt like the showrunners were still struggling to find their voice of confidence in telling such a unique type of story for the television medium. On top of that this introductory season had to set up such a huge world and story, so while trying to find the show's tone they also had to devote a lot of the pace to introductions and set up, which gave the season's first half a slow feel. All in all, season one definitely shone in it's clever writing and execution (no pun intended) that people tend to miss in the show these days, and remains one of the better seasons in terms of quality to me. It does have a slow pace due to a lot of set up, and some of the acting was not up to par with later seasons. **Season Two:** Season two may actually be my least favorite season, but there are quite a few praises to give before I get too deep into that. First of all, I think the experience and success of season one did wonders in developing a confident tone for the series. The actors as well seemed more comfortable in their roles. Lena, Peter, Nikolaj, Maisie, and many others knocked it out of the park with their respective arcs. On top of that, MOST of the writing was on top form, and they kept the show expanding while remaining intricate and logical. And of course I have to mention the triumph of the season that is "Blackwater", the show's first real battle. It was executed so well as a full episode with great choreography, effects, and performances; it created a brilliant climax for the season. The season is one of my least favorites though, in large part because it feels dangerously close to filler to me. It isn't filler and I'm aware of that, but even though I loved watching it when I finished it just felt like a "bridge" season... like all the good stuff was coming next season. The biggest example of this is Dany's arc. Now granted, the source material was not very eventful for her, but she was a very small part of the second book; also, the mysticism and foreshadowing in her last chapters did a whole lot to make it feel important. Translated to television without most of those elements included, however, and it just felt like something to do for that season with the big stuff happening later. It didn't have much affect on later plots other than showing her dragons had grown a bit, and the tension from the cringey "where are my dragons" conflict never landed. That was all my reaction, anyway. So overall: while the production, acting, dialogue, score, and scope of the show continued to improve, the writing of that particular plot and a constant sense of being a "gateway season" leaves this one to be perhaps my least favorite- though I will admit in terms of general production quality it makes sense the people objectively consider it "better" than some later seasons. **Season Three** Season Three is up there for me. It managed to get the "best" parts of both previous seasons and come out damn close to perfect for me. Unlike many other seasons, no "entire" story arc disappointed me. Generally, both acting AND writing were still improving, too. But apart from that, this season was well paced but stayed extremely eventful throughout with huge developments and shocking twists. Jaime's arc in particular was amazing, and Nikolaj did so damn well in taking that character people hated and making him sympathetic. The Red Wedding was harrowing, and Dany's arc was refreshingly satisfying after season two's mayhem. There are many more triumphs for the season, but overall it kept the standards set by season's one and two and then exceeded them by tossing in the big "game-changer" moments. No season is perfect though, even if this one comes close. I think Theon's "arc" got way too much screen time, mostly because that "arc" was just a solid few episodes of torture for the most part. I love his emotional moments early on, particularly the "my real father" bit. I enjoyed seeing him released and brought back by Ramsay, and even the first torture scene. By then, you felt for Theon at least a little, and got a feel for how much of a psychopath Ramsay was. I don't think we needed so much torture after that, just spread out the earlier scenes and the reveal of who Ramsay is and breakdown of Theon is still effective- if not more so. Another thing that felt weird for me was how underwhelming the finale was. I love season finales in GoT because so much always happens and usually ends up being an amazing mind fuck, and I was waiting for it that season (this may have partially been expectations from the book). I ended up being left with a feeling of "huh, that was it?" I do get that a softer ending made sense after the Red Wedding, and it obviously doesn't hurt the season as a whole too much, but that was the feeling I got and I can't change that. So, in all: I think in some ways, Season Three WAS the peak of the show's quality for me. It was the huge emotional game changer it needed to be and perfected the things that make GoT great: Production/score, amazing performances, brilliant and clever dialogue coupled with intricate and intelligent plots, and huge "WTF moments". Even with some minor personal hang ups, this season is about as close to "perfect" as any season of the show is. **PART ONE REVIEW** I can totally see why people think the show peaked in the first couple seasons. In many ways I agree. While season two is probably my least favorite, seasons one and three are very high up on my list so I can relate to this sentiment. And I do think the writing and dialogue peaked during this time, but there are things in the later seasons that I just love with all my heart. But that leads me into part two. --- **PART TWO: AWKWARD MIDDLE/TRANSITION PHASE (Seasons 4-5)** **Season Four:** When people talk about the "peak" of GoT or when it was "still good", I most often see season four thrown in with the first three. And while it has some amazing moments and brilliant examples of great writing, I feel like this was also the period where they had to accept they were going to pass the books and had to start adjusting the story a lot more. Especially being the middle of the series, they had to take what the series WAS and turn it into what it was going to be. And this season is where I personally started to notice the writing decline. Let's face it, though; when this season was good, god damn was it good. The purple wedding was exceptional, with everything from dialogue and interactions to the performances and tensity later in the sequence being handled beautifully. Then we also have Tyrion's arc- scenes like his trials and eventual confrontation with his father are, in my opinion, big factors that contribute to it being considered the best GoT season. That said, I personally have a few issues with the season. The problem lies in the fact that they adapted the first 2/3 of book three into season three and made a very compelling season out of it. That pretty much left ALL the climaxes of the book for season four- which sounds great on paper. It keeps everything eventful throughout and makes for a season devoted to huge developments. It creates a problem for pacing, though. I feel like they had to create filler, but keep it climactic in tone like everything else in the season. The night's watch going after the mutineers for example; it felt like they needed to stall before the battle, and wanted to have more action in this "action packed" season. I think they started to subconsciously try to one up themselves in violence as the show goes on, particularly with seasons like these. Kind of like Saw; it's a series of movies that focused heavily on plot early on, but later movies- while still having better plots than most horror, seemed to focus more on topping the last film's shock and gore. I think GoT has started to do this from season four until now- not on the same level as Saw for sure, but I just like the example. Season four also has my personal pick for worst written storyline in the show- and yes I hated it more than Dorne. It was Yara's attempt to rescue Reek/Theon. There were better ways to show that Theon had truly become Reek and also to show the iron born move on without him. Way too much time and attention was devoted to setting this up and executing this rescue, and it just felt rushed and out of place. The fight with Ramsay was cringy, how he showed up shirtless and was able to school these armored soldiers up and down. And when he releases the dogs THAT'S game over for Yara and her men? It had a weird feel, made no sense, and kind of just amounted to more filler in the long run. There were a couple other weird moments with these characters for me, a long with more instances of filler and one-upping on being violent. Thankfully, the season still remains fairly high up for me just because of how awesome half the content really is. It seriously does have some of the show's best moments, and those have the trademark intelligence the story had in the first three seasons. It just also contains a lot of the "weirdness" from later seasons. **Season Five** I will admit this is also not one of my favorite seasons, down towards the bottom of the list with season two. I don't want to touch on Dorne too much because I don't have much to say that hasn't been said already. We all know the problems with Dorne. Another thing I wasn't too keen on was that the first half of season five, while having some good moments, reminds me a lot of season two in the sense that it feels like just a bridge from one plot to the next, bordering on filler. Like season two, it wasn't *actually* filler, it was a lot of set up. However from episode 7 onward it was crazy eventful, and in the end I think season five was mostly a set up for seasons six and seven anyway. My big gripe with the season, though, is Jon's "death". I hate to compare to the books because I'm trying to be objective, but the comparison just shows so well how I feel the scene was silly. Now in the book, one big distinction is that the stabbings seem to be a spur of the moment decision. There were a lot of things Jon did to cause the mutiny, allowing the wildlings past the wall was just one of them. But it was the act of breaking his oaths and leading the wildlings south that actually caused this attack. So there didn't seem to be any set plans to mutiny, and when they decided to in that moment there were a ton of reasons, and it actually made sense that they were doing it "for the watch"; since Jon was in the middle of doing the thing the watch hated, killing him may actually have done SOMETHING for their 'cause'. In the show, the only reason seems to be that Jon let the wildlings in. That's it, and they were already saved. The watch couldn't kick them out, they outnumbered them 10/1. And they all owed their lives to Jon Snow, so killing him was stupid. The real kicker to that lack of logic, though... is that they PLANNED this on the show. They got together, set everything up, and killed him. They had the time to think it through, but I guess they thought the wildlings wouldn't be a threat. (And of course, the wildlings fuck their shit up early in the next season). Then they just leave Jon's body there, like "cool we did it, goodnight. what? oh we can burn it later let's just walk off dramatically". Sorry, that's my big rant for the season. But, even with those complaints and some faulty writing, I think the season get's more crap than it deserves. Up until the end, the wall was my favorite storyline for the season and I loved it- Kit stepped it up for his performance that season. I'm also definitely one of those who consider Hardhome to be one of the best episodes ever, too. I even loved Tyrion's travels and meeting Dany- his conversations with Varys and Jorah were a highlight for me. And in retrospect, while they were terrible moments, I don't blame the writers for the Sansa and Shireen moments in the show. I think while they were horrific to watch, they were blown out of proportion a bit. **PART TWO REVIEW** I think seasons four and five are like the "awkward teenage" phase for GoT. They were going off book for the first time, connecting plots and trying to set up the end, while also transitioning the show into something completely different than it was (and I will go into this more in part 3). In general, I would say I like this area of the show less than seasons 1-3, and SO FAR would say that there is a noticeable drop in quality of writing by this point. No surprises there, that's pretty much how EVERYONE feels. However, visually and in terms of musical score, the show is better than ever by this point. The acting is also better than ever. --- **PART THREE: MODERN GAME OF THRONES (Season 6-Now)** **Season Six:** First, I want to go over a couple factors that make season six very interesting. I mentioned when talking about the fifth season that it was mostly set up for seasons six and seven. So the set up is already done here, but also this is the first season to completely pass the books. What I'm getting at is that with only a shortened season 7 and shorter season 8 left, the true climax starts in season six, and with all the set up done the "awkward transition" has ended. We have now left what the show WAS and what it is going to be. So yes, the writing has not hit the high-points of seasons 1-3 again, nor is it likely to do so again. But, that's not the only strength the show had. These characters have already been fleshed out, and even if there are some inconsistencies from time to time there are STILL pretty much no characters like them in visual media, and I think THAT is a big part of what keeps the show so high up there for me. The world and characters have had fifty episodes to flesh them out, and now I'm beyond invested. Season six was the payoff for everything that was set up so far, and got the endgame started. And for me, it was extremely satisfying. Now, season six wasn't big on surprises, it bordered on formulaic, and in a lot of ways the developments played it very safe... it still might be my favorite season. The biggest reason for this is the emotional pay off of the season. It's predictable but that's partly because so much of what is happening has been set up for five seasons. And when they perform and direct these scenes well, it is godly. Like when Sansa and Jon reunited... with no dialogue there was SO MUCH emotion in just their faces, the music, and the camera shots. There were so many other emotional moments in this season that were pulled off so well- the ending to "The Door", Dany uniting the Dothraki, the R+L=J feeding into the KITN scene, and so many others... the pure pay off and emotion made this season my favorite. Not everything was superb, the pacing was a bit weird in episodes 6-8 for me, and I was definitely not a fan of the writing in Arya's braavos arc; it felt inconsistent and made the faceless men look way less serious than they should. Nothing unique there, I'm sure my complaints on that arc are very similar to countless others seen here. But that was my only large issue with season six. Sure, it was predictable in a lot of ways. But it delivered more than half of my favorite moments in the show and took us to where I was wanting to be from season one, and damn did it bring a tear to my eye doing it. **Season Seven:** I know this season isn't over yet, but with only one episode left and with all of this fresh on my mind I want to include it; I may update this when the finale airs. So Season Seven is another mixed bag for me, but is honestly probably in my top 3 still. The writing is more like seasons 4-5 for me, there are a lot of inconsistencies and a few outright plot-holes. More than there were in season six. However, I am loving seeing all of these characters come together. So many amazing interactions: Dany and Varys, Dany and Jon, Arya and Sansa and Bran, Bran and fking Littlefinger (chaos is a ladder!), Tyrion and Jaime, everyone from the seven who went beyond the wall... I could go on and on. It's the characters, and that brings me to the Field of Fire... that's what I still think makes this show great. Yes, it's transitioned from being subtly political and quietly clever to being an all out fantasy war, but we still have these complex characters fighting in it... ones that have been built through endless development and all of those complex plot's we've seen- all of that is coming out of them in these new battles, and FoF was great for this reason. We finally get to see the dragons tear apart a Lannister army, it's fanstasy af, but we have these two truly humanized and developed sides on the exchange. And while much of what made the show clever is not there, this is STILL breaking new ground for fantasy. So with some sloppy writing noted, the characters alone make this season very high up for me. Since it's not over, I don't have much more to say now, but as mentioned above I very well may add more to this when season seven ends. **PART THREE REVIEW:** After going over where the show is now, I have to say that while the show's writing may have peaked in season three, it has a different but valuable quality that's peaking now. After season three there was a decline for me in writing and keeping the world consistent. However, the phase of GoT we are at now is something new... and being that I enjoy reading and writing myself I KNOW that writing is super important, and I miss that tightness that it had in the beginning very much. But the writing isn't TERRIBLE now, it's just not as full-proof in preventing holes and inconsistencies as earlier seasons. Now it does about as well as most decent television does for that. I know that having that smart writing that was above everything else was what made so many people love the show, but it's got to be hard to maintain that level when adapting such complicated books- and not being able to read the last couple. But apart from that, the show still has a lot that other shows don't, and I'm not talking about visual effects or production values. As I have said, the characters have already had so much development. I know everyone has the gripes on certain character growth (like many of you, I hate how much they have flopped with Jaime's development), but for the most part we have these detailed, flawed, and full characters involved in this "great war" that's coming. I think one of the biggest things that turns people off of "new" GoT is the idea that it is not a clever show of political intrigue that defies all fantasy tropes anymore- that it is becoming the fantasy trope it was originally dissecting. This is understandable, and it is a big part of what made GoT so special to begin with. But as I mentioned before, by developing these human characters in the very subtle and HUMAN conflict in the first half of the series, I think the show is and will continue to dissect those tropes by putting these fully realized characters in the middle of all of this high fantasy conflict. I think that will play a huge role in the end of the show, but for now I can see a huge difference in most high fantasy and this story, even as it is in the tv show now. You would be hard pressed to find a fantasy series that could pull off the character depth of Jaime's charge on Dany in the Field of Fire, or the heartbreaking "hold the door" revelation. Though it is sad that we lost that subtle writing from before, we still have these characters keeping this show fresh. The story was always going to shift from the political conflict to a supernatural war, the set up was in the very first scene of the show- and in the very first chapter of the books. So that's why I have a hard time saying the show peaked in season three: there was so much done so right in that season and it had that incredible writing that we know and love, but I honestly don't think it holds much weight in the character depth of those we still have left in seasons six and seven, or how these characters are influencing fate and the great wars to come. --- **TOTAL REVIEW:** **Again, this is just from my POV, not trying to make these sound like "objective facts".** * **No season of GoT is perfect. Earlier seasons that adapted the books more closely generally had better writing, but had some of the same types of issues from time to time that newer seasons have.** * **I do miss the subtle and clever nature of the political conflict from earlier seasons, and without source material to adapt I do feel like the writing can get sloppy at times, now. These two factors definitely contribute to the feeling that the show is declining in some ways.** * **That said, I'm okay with the change into a more 'high fantasy' conflict because we always knew it was coming, and I think the characters have more than enough depth to keep the show fresh and unique no matter how deep the fantasy elements go.** * **The rockiest part of the series for me is the middle- seasons 4 and 5 struggle with the new task of working off book and transitioning the series into a different form. This results in more mixed bags so to speak- some storylines being much more compelling than others.** * **Character strength in the past couple seasons have kept me very invested in the show, and I think watching these characters come to power, collide, and meet their fate is as appealing for me in it's own way as the intrigue of earlier seasons was.** **Overall, the show has never stopped having amazing moments, and has also never been perfect; while I have personal preferences of seasons or stories, as it progresses some strengths get better and some issues get worse. It's a matter of personal preference, and for me the weaknesses of the new episodes are made up for by it's strengths.** **And for shit's and giggles, my current rankings for all seven seasons of Game of Thrones:** **Season Six  gt; Season Three  gt; Season Seven  gt; Season One  gt; Season Four  gt; Season Five  gt; Season Two** --- --- --- **EDIT: POSTED THIS IN A COMMENT, BUT I'LL PUT IT IN THE POST TOO:** **I just wanted to thank you guys. I didn't think I'd get much feedback at all, but I actually got a lot! And like 95% of it has been supportive and super rational and friendly discussion about difference in opinion. I hate to admit it, but I did not expect to find that here. To to majority of you who disagreed but were willing to explain why and not be a dick about it; you are the best kind of person, and the world needs more of you. Thank you for giving me a ton more faith in this fandom. Love you guys!**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just one season left; six episodes... who's fucked?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-29 06:29:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Season 7 was a little light on deaths (in the Game of Thrones spectrum, that is)... but we all know those last six episodes are going to be a bloodbath. This is the last season to play the "who's gonna die" game... and though the season is more than a year away, there's a strong chance we'll get another script leak way before that. So this time we have now will be our last to guess at future deaths without knowing what's going to happen. I made a poll [here.](https://goo.gl/Upm2xh) That's just for fun, but feel free to tell us here who you think will die in the final battles and even how/why it might happen. Valar Morguhlis. *edit: I included some people who may not return to the show to be thorough; same goes for the named characters at the wall when the Night King took it down.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>While we continue to wait for hiatus to end, those of few of you who have not yet checked out Boku No Hero Acadamia SHOULD.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-20 07:52:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realize the anime has gotten a respectable popularity for it, particularly with season two finishing up now. But, to those of you who have NOT yet seen it, I wanted to say that it fills a couple holes left by HxH and is similar in many ways while also remaining very much its own thing. I don't intend to get into any spoilers- and I'm a couple episodes behind on the new season, which still has yet to air the final two episodes. I do want to explain a bit more why I recommend this anime as a HxH fan. First off, I think HxH is a god damn masterpiece- it is beyond a doubt in my top 5 anime (possibly top 3), is by a long shot my favorite shounen, and has cemented itself in one of my favorite pieces of media in general. While Boku No Hero Academia (which I will refer to as BnH for simplicity's sake) has not quite hit that level yet, I haven't enjoyed a show that is at least loosely a shounen since Magi and HxH. I saw the first season a month or two back, and already enjoyed it. It was easily an 8/10 for me, which I like to think of as my "no regrets" level of rating. May not be perfect or have some "wow" factor to boost it to a 9, but not a single episode was one that I did not enjoy. I felt the urge to binge a bit (like HxH), and when it was over I already considered it to be a modern classic in a lot of ways, even if it hadn't become one of my favorites yet. But I started season two a couple of days ago, and woah am I getting into it. In like three days, I have watched 21 episodes. Now this doesn't seem like a lot, since episodes are short and anime is super easy for most of us to binge... but these past three days I have been working at a restaurant from about 2 in the afternoon until after midnight- a long with obligations outside of work and a social life (went out to a bar with a few work friends night before last). I still managed to binge the majority of this season. It has gotten a bit deeper than I expected, and is easily becoming at least a 9/10 for me. Now, those similarities to HxH that I mentioned? Without going too much into the plot, BnH is a shounen that is not afraid to step away from those shounen tropes from time to time. Not on the same deconstructionalist levels of HxH, maybe (yet) but it is apparent that it is not afraid to do what's right for the story rather than fulfill specific fantasies a typical shounen audience might have. I see this particularly in the main character: so far, while perhaps not having the same amount of potential for psychological depth as Gon (again, YET- I'll address this near the end), the show definitely makes a point to show that he is the underdog here- definitely building up to be a very strong character, but the show is doing an extremely good job of making this feel earned in my opinion, and it is not going to be immediate satisfaction in terms of getting him where he needs to be. The development and "training" is very entertaining though, and I am loving the ride there. Another prominent example is that they are not afraid to let the MC lose from time to time. It's also a similar situation where the MC has "potential" to rival every single character (for the most part), he is currently outclassed by most people who are serious "fighters". This brings up another similarity to HxH- the characters: While I doubt the supporting characters will get the level of focus in HxH (to the point of not even having the main character involved in major events), there is certainly an incredibly massive cast of unique characters, a great many of whom seem to be getting a decent amount of character to development. The power system, while not by any means as detailed or thought out as HxH, does end up with a similar result of having a TON of characters each possessing very specific and unique abilities that give insight into their personality and provides endless possibilities for combat, match-ups of opponents and in some cases team-mates, and the strategy involved with the former two points. Like I said, it's far more simple than the Nen system, but the feeling of seeing new characters unique "powers" revealed definitely gives me a similar feeling to the way HxH handled that very concept. Particularly when there are so many characters after less than 40 episodes, and I definitely get the impression that as the series progresses there will be a lot more. And quite a few of been given a lot of development, attention, and history. Now this is my opinion, but I will say I don't feel like any character has reached the compelling level of development or backstory of HxH... yet lol. Which brings me to explain why I feel it's been so necessary to add those "yets" to certain things. I see a TON of potential for growth in this anime. The second season addressed a lot of stuff and went a lot deeper into existing things than I had expected from the first season- while certain aspects of the show are very simple, it appears that the story itself is not afraid to grow more complex and get a bit "deeper" than the surface level the beginning of the show reveals (again, this is reminiscent of HxH). In fact, when you consider that it has not yet hit 40 episodes yet, the amount of characters and their respective development and certain story aspects is actually very impressive. If it has the amount of time to grow, it seriously may rival HxH after 100+ episodes for me... now HxH is incredibly special for me, and if I were to be honest I would say I don't expect to love it quite that much, but I 100% expect it to at least reach for that mark and become one of my all-time favorites- I'd say after 35ish episodes it's already a favorite of mine. On that note, I've actually heard that the latest arc in the manga has a certain "Chimera Ant" quality to it... I only saw this in one person's reddit comment (on this sub actually), so I'm not sure how much truth there is to this, but it has DEFINITELY piqued my interest- the CA arc was a significant portion of what makes HxH so incredible to me. And this makes me want to read the manga for BnH, too. Like Berserk and HxH, I could already see it being the type of manga that I would really enjoy reading- even parts I've already seen in the anime. So, sorry if this gets brought up more than I've seen around here, and again if most of you have already seen the anime; I'm sure a great many of you have. But I'm getting so into it, and with the HxH vibes I get from time to time, I just wanted to put this out there just in case anyone who is possibly interested can just get this additional enthusiastic recommendation from someone who shares a love for HxH. All of that said, the ways this show reminds me of HxH is not over-the-top: while there are a few things I've specifically noted, for the most part I wouldn't GENERALLY say the show is "like HxH". In fact, in the first season, I thought of a few other shows it reminded me of first: One Punch Man, Kill la Kill (much less on that vibe for me now), and "DanMachi" are just a couple episodes. All in all, it definitely has it's own vibe and is worth checking out for far more reasons than the similarities to HxH. Also, I'm very sorry for the length of this post- that tends to happen with me. I suppose the right thing to do is add a TLDR, so here goes. **---** **TL;DR-** My Hero Academia is at least loosely a shounen anime, but one that has done a couple unexpected things to set itself apart from other anime of the same genre. The main character has a huge focus of having to "earn" his power and is not OP for the sake of being OP, and he is surrounded by an impressively large cast of colorful and unique characters; many with a fair amount of development and focus and an individual "power". After a binge of most of season two, I am really impressed with it's direction and already LOVE it- I think it's going to achieve great things in the long run. I think you should check it out, especially you guys since you like HxH- we could easily have very similar tastes in what appeals to "these" kinds of anime. **---** Other than all that, a big thank you to those of you who read any of this. If just one person sees this and watches this anime to their own enjoyment, then I can't ask for anymore. :) To those of you who HAVE seen it, feel free to talk about it! Do you agree/disagree with my assessments here? To those that have read the manga ahead of where the anime is, do you have any comments on my assumptions of the potential of where the story is headed? Remember that I am still a couple episodes from being caught up on season two (though I will most likely watch those tonight), and would generally like to avoid specific spoilers for the manga since I intend to read it once I finish this season. I'm not too worried about minor details about future plot points, but to be safe if you want to go into that maybe tag as spoilers for other people's sake. Thanks again, and hope that some of you enjoy the anime!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would love some help for a $1000 build</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-21 10:21:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm currently a pleb playing on an Asus I had bought already built a few years back for school, and it's seriously starting to decline in performance. From what I'm experiencing, and considering all I would like to upgrade, I'm pretty much going to start from scratch. I don't need monitors, a keyboard, or a mouse- for now I'm satisfied with what I have currently. Really I just need the desktop itself. I will use this PC mostly for gaming- I'm content with 1080p for the time being, but if a higher resolution is possible with this budget I would prefer that capability. Other than high res gaming (with high frame rate of course), there's not a whole lot extra I intend to do with this computer. I do enjoy video editing, but rarely have the time for it and it is not necessarily a priority. Otherwise, apart from occasional streaming and web-surfing, I do intend to use this PC to play and stream high sound quality music. (I currently have no speakers and a sub-par headset that I work with, so advice on what to go for here would be appreciated too). So that's pretty much it. I plan on both going over any final build choose with my friend, and will most likely build it with him. But I would love to see a few full build suggestions. I am way out of the loop in what components are the best currently. I do want to note that the price is not very flexible- in fact $1000 is very much on the high end of what I can spend, and would require extra time spent saving money. I'm only considering that much (for now) because my birthday is very close and I should be getting some money to use- most likely won't even cover half of this budget, but should be a nice boost to get me started in setting aside money I earn from my job. Honestly, I would love to see some builds closer to the $800 range as well. But thanks in advance for any help! --- edit: extra bits of information- I would like potential for overclocking. I am currently using 2 monitors, but will eventually want to use 3: based on finances, for the immediate future I imagine none of them will be anything but 1920x1080p. If there is any other information you would like feel free to ask.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So, about the whole business of shooting "fake" scenes to throw off spoilers...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-22 10:00:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm kind of confused by this. I know this was a couple weeks back that HBO mentioned this, but it keeps popping up on my mind. Are spoilers really THAT big of a deal? Were they seriously intending on doing this? I mean, wouldn't filming "fake" scenes take up a portion of the show's precious budget and almost more importantly time? It's already going to be an extra long wait for the final season, and MOST fans don't even read the spoilers, and far far far FAR less actively take part in uncovering them. To waste the show's budget and take up more time (even if it's minimal) just to ATTEMPT to throw off leaks that most people won't read just seems like a dick move to the fanbase of the show. Alright, ignoring the fact that anyone who is close enough to the production to be able to leak a full out synopsis of the season complete with scene descriptions that have actual dialogue and character emotion would MOST LIKELY also know which scenes are fake... There still would be some stuff that's obvious. For example, a huge scene with the Army of the Dead or an insane battle sequence would be WAY too expensive to shoot fake scenes, so if we get any production leaks of this we can assume that's real. It not only seems far from foolproof or even that likely to succeed, but is kind of insulting to the people already working so hard on the show to put them through that and also a middle finger to the majority of fans who may have to wait longer just because HBO is butthurt they're "extra security" wasn't working. Maybe I over estimate how much time and money it would take to do this, but it still seems like a huge waste of effort and really just plain stupid. I still expect to be get reliable leaks for the next season, and all this action would do is make me think less of HBO. If they even go through with it, I really do think that it's so dumb of an idea that there's a chance they're just blowing smoke cause they're pissed and won't actually doing anything. I mean am I just being stupid and some less than reliable sources or missed some sarcasm in the statement? Or am I just putting too much thought into it? The idea of it kinda just built up this little rant in me, I guess.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any tips on conveying closeness and deep friendship between two characters?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-23 11:56:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm working on a story that will begin with a main character who's best friend from years ago returns into his life. His friend will reveal what he's been up to and include the main character in this "situation", which will be the main focus of the story. However, much of this will rely heavily establishing how strong their friendship was and how close they still are, and how this is strained by the friends new obsessions and they start drifting apart. I'm really enthusiastic about this story, but this pulling this off well is crucial to making it work; and this will require two of what I feel like are my weakest points as a writer: 1) Writing "casual" dialogue 2) Conveying strong bonds between friends without being over the top about it- basically using subtlety to show their relationship. The first one is a big part of what throws me off in STARTING stories... Typically I'll want to set up the main characters and their relationships before introducing the main conflict, which needs a lot of "casual dialogue" so to speak. The characters just talking about everyday life, often the idea is for the dialogue to serve the purpose of establishing the nature of their relationships. For some reason, though, I'm really bad at writing normal everyday discussions. It always seems so "cringey" to me. A lot of that is probably normal for writers, particularly in a first draft, but still I just feel totally at a loss on how best to go about this. In this situation, I think I want to jump pretty much right into the story from the beginning; with perhaps the first scene being the reunion of the two characters and the old friends explanation of where he has been, and by extension the general plot of the story itself. I struggle much less for dialogue when it is wrapped up deeply in the story, and on top of that I think this is a natural starting place. Other than the friendship of these characters, going back earlier doesn't have much to do with the plot of this story (at least the way I have it in my head currently). But that leaves me with the task of using the dialogue between them to show how close they have been. Of course as they continue to interact throughout the story their time together will help towards this as well, but I feel like their initial moments should be a very significant step in cementing all of this. I know practice and a lot of work writing and re-writing will go a long way in addressing my weaknesses here, but I was wondering if any of you have some general tips that may be helpful. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this! Any insight is appreciated greatly!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers] Interesting thing I noticed from episode 2x02</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-24 10:28:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if this has been brought up, but in the episode with the Jerry daycare, a man introduces himself to Jerry as "Paul Fleishman", explaining that there are infinite time-lines, and in *some* of them Beth re-marries. When the episode first came out, I took this as a joke that Beth leaves Jerry for another man in some realities. Now, with context, the phrasing is very interesting. It's not that Beth leaves Jerry in some realities, it's that Beth "RE" marries in some realities. I think there's a decent chance that was foreshadowing the divorce of this season, implying that for every Jerry in every dimension that the split up is inevitable. Is it possible that every version of Rick at some point plays off Beth and Jerry's unhealthy relationship to cause a divorce? Based on Rick's personality, I could see this being something that ends up happening in most if not all realities. Probably putting too much thought into it, but I still think the line is very interesting.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Possible Season 3 Spoilers] I think the passing of time is very favorable on Rick and Morty</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-30 12:25:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the first part of this season I wasn't coming to this sub much, but from what I gather there was a fair amount of sentiment that this was a weak season... especially before the break (and the infamous "Ricklantis" episode). Now, I've been enjoying this season since the first episode- but if I really think about it I might have agreed with that sentiment a couple weeks ago. For the first few episodes I sort of felt like season two had already achieved more in my mind by the same point in season three. Granite, I really loved Pickle Rick and Rest and Ricklaxation, but I kept thinking about Mortynight Run and Total Rickall, not to mention the infamous ending of Autoerotic Assimilation. While I was really enjoying season three, it just didn't feel like it was there so to speak. That said, I feel like I've come to realize something about the way I appreciate Rick and Morty. I binged season one and loved it, and got to tune in every week for season two. And watching it weekly, it dawned on me the other day that I had a very similar experience that I did for most of this current season. I remember loving a couple episodes, but thinking it was not as strong overall as the first season. However, as time passed and the season was over, I feel like letting the episodes sink in over that time made me appreciate them so much more. I don't even remember how it happened, but at some point I actually came to like season two more than season one. Both seasons had episodes I was less entertained by: for season one, the couple that come to mind are Anatomy Park and Raising Gazorpazorp. In two, it would be episodes like Look Who's Purging Now or maybe Interdimensional Cable 2. All of the above episodes are funny, and there really isn't an episode of the show I actively dislike, but those just seem more forgettable to me. However season two in particular had so many episodes that would be ranked super high for me: Big Trouble in Little Sanchez, Total Rickall, Mortynight Run, and The Ricks Must Be Crazy are all huge favorites of mine. The point, though, is that while they were coming out every week I didn't exactly feel that way. And already as we near the end of this season, I feel like I'm appreciating the strength of the episodes more and more. Rest and Ricklaxation I absolutely adored, and the past three episodes have been incredible- as cliche as it sounds these days, I really think The Ricklantis Mixup is my favorite episode of the entire series. Maybe with such build up of hype for new seasons along with having to watch them one at a time with at least a week in between is affecting my ability to appreciate this show- and the test of time is how I truly determine where these seasons stand for me. I already feel that a few weeks from now I will see this as a very strong season indeed. Just the past couple weeks have me loving even the earlier episodes of the season even more. Anyone else experience something similar in watching the show? In the sense that the more time passes the better the episodes hold up. I can only speak for myself, and I don't think most people are criticizing this season as much as they were a few weeks back, but where do you stand on this season: weak or strong?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I ranked the thirty-one episodes in order from my least favorite to my personal fave (spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-08 13:04:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yep, I'm a loser who has a bit too much time on my hands, and because of that I actually threw in a few thoughts on each episode too. Figured we could use a break from the McDonalds posts anyway (but I'll still take this little opportunity to say fuck McDonalds). Obviously this is based on my enjoyment of the episodes, and not an attempt to objectively claim which ones are best. Also worth noting that I don't dislike any episode of the show, I could literally play any of them and enjoy it. **Note: I will have some spoilers in my descriptions. Probably shouldn't look through this unless you've seen everything or don't care about spoilers. If you just don't care about my thoughts behind this (can't blame ya too much), the episodes and their rank are in bold.** Here we go. From thirty-one (least favorite) to the top dog. **Thirty-One: 2x08 Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate** Something had to come in last place, but I didn't have as many issues with this as some people did. I think a lot of the television "clips" were fucking hysterical, about as much as the first interdimensional episode. However, with the novelty worn off and a less appealing story tying the clips together, it still falls below. **Thirty: 1x07 Raising Gazorpazorp** As I've said I enjoy all the episodes, so for a lot of the ones near the bottom of the list it comes down to memorability, or how much the episode "stands out". This episode is great (I particularly love the family gags when Morty brings the sex robot home), it just happens to be one of those episodes with the least amount to set aside for me. **Twenty-Nine: 3x10 The Rickchurian Mortydate** This episode is strange. The expectations for a finale to be a "big" one didn't really play into this ranking, but to be honest the first half of this episode just didn't land for me. The jokes seemed a bit weird and is probably the closest an episode has come to being "boring" for me so far. However, I did really enjoy the attempts to kill Rick by the president's men (and their disastrous results). There was also some great moments for the characters in the Smith family in the end. These high notes weren't incredibly impressive compared to what the show has done in the past, but it saved itself from being my least favorite episode. **Twenty-Eight: 1x03 Anatomy Park** Again, this is a fun episode that just ends up being less memorable for me. Some great moments of humor (particularly the end with the giant hovering hobo) aside, it's not a big one for standing out to me. **Twenty-Seven: 1x04 M. Night Shaym-aliens** This and the next couple episodes fall into a similar category of standing out less with no real faults, so I'm just gonna go over some highlights for them- it's funny how even my least favorite episodes have some great quotes and moments. I loved the simulation jokes ("My Man! Slow down!"... The toaster bit, "you sure you haven't seen that before, Morty?"), but the part of this episode that resonates the most with me is pretty obvious: watching Rick come out on top after all of the back and forth mindfuckery was hella satisfying. **Twenty-Six: 2x09 Look Who's Purging Now** I haven't seen the purge, so I honestly don't know if I'd appreciate this episode more with that context. I'm familiar enough with the premise to find it funny, though. I loved the song choice when they start the killing spree, and the old man's ominous hints and the crazy stuff he intends to do during the purge. **Twenty-Five: 3x02 Rickmancing the Stone** The plotline with Morty and that serial killers arm alone carried this episode for me in a very positive way. All the jokes landed, from the "this isn't over" bit to the casual way he drowned that guy near the end. On top of that, it was a great start for the character development Morty received in season three, which is one of my favorite things about the recent season. **Twenty-Four: 1x11 Ricksy Business** And just like that, we're out of the episodes I just find less memorable and the hard part begins: comparing the episodes that *do* stand out. While this one wasn't some big crazy finale, the big party allowed for some great moments and of course the big dimensional hop. It also introduced bird person which adds to it's credit, and he marks his entrance with his infamous insight into Rick's mental state. **Twenty-Three: 1x02 Lawnmower Dog** It says a lot that already loved Rick and Morty after just the first two episodes of the show. The inception style dream subplot was full of great stuff, but the Snuffles/Snowball story was a damn good follow up to the pilot. It wasn't the most insane plot they have done, but I loved the way they executed it with just a slight hint of darkness... "Where are my testicles, Summer?" Delivered coldly by a Snuffles towering over her in the dark is an all-time favorite quote from the show. **Twenty-Two: 1x01 Pilot** Such a great opener for the show. It did a fantastic job of introducing all the great elements of the show: it had plenty of great low-brow jokes from "Principal Vagina" to stick mega seeds up Morty's butt, since his butthole was still taut but malleable. It also had a bit of the existential humor (the coughed up being that is born, lives, and dies as they run away with Rick just shouting "Don't think about it!") and a few good tastes of the show's darkness, like when Morty kills the bureaucrat and Rick's psychotic monologue over a convulsing Morty in the end. It would probably be even higher on this list if later episodes didn't have the advantage of a bit more depth established for the characters and a better overall sense of the show's tone. **Twenty-One: 1x09 Something Ricked This Way Comes** One of the only episodes that deals with the "supernatural" and I loved the context they used for this. I thought the character of the devil was hilarious and really enjoyed his relationship with Summer. The concept of his feud with Rick was straight up brilliant, though; everything from the way he "invented" ways around the curses to how he just got so deep under the devils skin and then got bored when he won, proving he was a bigger dick than Satan himself. Plus there's the added bonus of Rick and Summer beating up the devil in the end, along with a nazi and a dog-kicker. **Twenty: 3x04 Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender** On the surface, I might have guessed that I would rank this lower. However, this episode has a lot going for it to get a certain level of love for me. For some reason, all the scenes with Noob-Noob in the beginning killed me. It had no reason to be as funny as it was. So much humor that shouldn't have landed somehow managed to make me weak in the whole episode. The way they teased some real human emotion from Rick to end in a Noob-Noob reveal/joke was perfect. This episode has a big highlight, though, and it seems to be recurring throughout the third season: Morty's development. He's so used to Rick's crap by this point that he can go through every single obstacle with very little thought. On top of that we can see his naivety slowly slipping away and the start of a cynicism that borders on "Rick level". In particular I loved that he is at a point where he is disarming Ricks drunken neutrino bombs. "Too many", as he points out furiously. **Nineteen: 3x05 The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy** The Rick and Jerry episode worked well, and the conflict between the two brought up some really natural plot points and character moments. The "immortality field" also had some great (and fucked up) humor. I also really loved everything with Morty, Beth, and Summer. This was another great episode for highlighting the character growth of Morty, particularly how desensitized he is growing to all of the craziness. He actually seems to go to a pretty dark place when he confronts the guy who made summer self-conscious... it's also worth nothing that it was never shown what happens between them and the "reverse-y" machine thing Morty had pointed at the guy. We also got a decent glimpse at Beth's own brand of crazy. **Eighteen: 2x01 A Rickle in Time** A really solid premier for the second season that feeds off the first season's finale really well. The hypothetical time humor may be a bit silly but it made for some excellent moments. The first season had some great character development for sure, but I think it makes sense that more of that would come from seasons two and three, and this episode starts that off pretty well. Particularly the big moment when Rick sacrifices himself for Morty- that is until he realizes it's possible to live and begs God to live, then saves himself with a big "fuck you" to the big man. Plus the Einstein post-credit scene is funny as fuck. **Seventeen: 2x02 Mortynight Run** Rick and Morty is quite often very clever, but there a couple of instances where it is not only clever but just really brilliant in the context of the established universe. There are so many possibilities to play with when you are dealing with alternate realities and a genius who can interact with them all, and some gimmicks that the show uses just come out flawless: I think the Jerry daycare is one of those things that is just absolutely brilliant within the context of the show, and as a result all the related humor hits so welll. This episode also has Blips and Chitz, which leads to Roy; Morty's confusion upon returning after living an entire life in a video game just made this "joke" or whatever it was work so well. Then of course we have the "fart", with some great trippy music scenes. I particularly love the scene where the fart causes the deaths of an entire fleet of police-ships while Rick and Morty just watch in shock. Accompanied by the catchy "moonmen" song, I felt this scene was really effective. **Sixteen: 3x09 The ABCs of Beth** This episode is mostly ranked higher for it's fantastic attention to Beth's character; it very much succeeded in showing some disturbing insight to her mental state, which season three had already brought into question. Everything in Froopyland was fantastically fucked up, too. I've seen some criticism for the dialogue, but personally I loved the "heart to heart" between Beth and Rick in the end, and the decision not to confirm if Beth is a clone or not was definitely the right call. Also I have to mention Morty again in this episode... I loved how knowledgeable he is about the race that Jerry's partner belongs to, another prime example in season three of how much Morty has grown through his adventures with Rick. **Fifteen: 2x10 The Wedding Squanchers** The best finale of the three existing seasons, this episode goes big for the last half of the episode. The insight of Rick's past with the galactic federation, the resulting relationship with his friends, the death of Bird Person and his ultimate arrest made for a big episode. It may have been even higher on the list, but ultimately this episode works as a big climactic episode to end a season, and is in a lot of ways "undone" by the next season. Which is for the best since Rick and Morty works so well as an episodic show. **Fourteen: 2x05 Get Schwifty** This episode obviously has a lot to offer. It spawned so much for the fandom that it has to have a decent ranking. We got the get schwifty song, the "show me what you got" memes, a lot of satire on the state of religion, and quite simply the best Ice T jokes the world has created yet. Water T and the Rise of the Numbericrons will inevitably be the greatest story of a hero we will ever see. **Thirteen: 2x03 Auto Erotic Assimilation** A great episode in general, but it is in the top half of these episodes mostly because it offers more insight into the already established depression that Rick deals with. His unhealthy relationship with Unity has some deeper implications if you pay attention, but no matter what you notice the ending of the episode shoves all of this into your face without mercy. The final scene where Rick gets just trashed, pulls out a being that seems to be in pain and destroys it, and is about to do the same to himself but is too intoxicated and just passes out was one of the most emotional moments of the entire show. The song choice was perfect, too. **Twelve: 1x05 Meeseeks and Destroy** While this may not be the most clever or the most emotional episode, it does offer some of both. The Meeseeks gimmick may not scream "wit", but the idea behind it and the resulting situation is a pretty clear mark of creativity. As far as the Rick and Morty adventure, the bathroom scene with Mr. Jellybean may be disturbing but it is a nice moment to see that Rick genuinely cares about Morty and goes out of his way to make things alright for him. I also loved all of the nonsense in that tavern. Overall, though, it is the idea behind the Meeseeks box that works so well... for some reason. Somehow, it managed to create a story full of insanity and quotable moments that make this episode one of the most entertaining and memorable so far. **Eleven: 1x08 Rixty Minutes** Another episode that is brilliant within this universe: a box that allows access to channels from every conceivable reality and the absurd amount of random fuckery it provides- now that is a great concept. Now use that to create a series of one-off clips to showcase the improvisational abilities of the writes and an existential storyline behind those watching it to tie everything together... and you have a straight up brilliant episode. The scene with Morty and Summer is amazing. It's just a huge added bonus that some of those television bits are the funniest things I have ever seen. **Ten: 2x04 Total Rickall** This episode is top ten worthy to me for it's humor alone. The memory embedding parasites were a great idea, and Mr. Poopy Butthole has become an iconic character for the show. This episode had a rapid-fire method of humor that worked crazy well for me. There are too many awesome bits that come to mind to mention many of them, it was pretty much the whole episode and it's pacing. The ending, though, when Beth shoots Mr. Poopy Butthole and he just bleeds out, real as shit... What can I even say. Going from that to the shot of Beth downing a bunch of wine shaking violently is possibly my favorite cut to credits scene. **Nine: 2x06 The Ricks Must Be Going Crazy** The fact that this episode is based around Rick going into the world he created to power his battery is already insane. I love the repetition of each scientist creating a new world as a source for power and all of the resulting stuff. The best material of this episode is honestly Summer waiting in the ship, which has the "keep summer safe" protocol active. Of course it gets dark real quick by maiming and killing people, but as soon as the restriction is made not to cause physical harm it shows that psychological methods can get just as dark. The true humor of this episode, and what makes it an all-timer for me, is how much the ship inevitably does to "keep Summer safe" while obeying her wishes the entire time. Well, that and Morty's time with the Tree People. **Eight: 2x07 Big Trouble in Little Sanchez** This one is another classic. Beth and Jerry's marriage counseling was good, and I died when that psychedelic other-wordly "goddess Beth" appeared. But most people remember this episode because of Tiny Rick, and rightfully so- this episode is his. So much great material just by putting him in the spotlight, and ultimately revealing his subconscious cries for help. And God help me, when he returns to his body and just starts going at all his other "bodies" with axe- fully naked and getting blood all over himself and his mortified grandchildren- THAT... I just loved that. **Seven: 3x06 Rest and Ricklaxation** This has my favorite opening scene. The "in-and-out" adventure and the resulting chaos all leads up to that break down in the ship. Morty just starts crying, but that primal scream from Rick is when you know shit is real. It makes so much sense in terms of where the characters are while remaining both funny and a little dark. So they go on a vacation, which leads to one of my favorite plotlines. They separate the part of them they view as toxic from the rest of them, creating to sentient beings for one person. This just adds so much insight to each character while creating crazy and hysterical situations at the same time. Obviously a big feature of this is that it shows the extent of how much Rick cares for Morty, and how he views this as a toxic weakness. Another interesting thing to see is how Morty- who has lived his whole life being looked down on and not valued much- acts when his toxic anxiety and self-esteem issues are removed. This doesn't lead to any big revelation of his character, but it is very interesting to see how he starts to act. Especially in a season full of character development for him... I'm really starting to think Morty's character is going to head in a dark direction somewhere in the series future, especially considering that "Evil Morty" is actually a thing. **Six: 3x08 Morty's Mind Blower's** I think they learned their lesson after the second interdimensional cable: random one offs can be a humorous tool, but the novelty of that particular idea has long worn off and on top of that viewers still need something decent and cohesive to string everything together. I think this was a brilliant answer to this need, The idea of using time's that Morty's mind had been wiped as a source for some "one offs" not only opened the door to a decent episode arc to tie the clips together but also gave a unique spin to the clips themselves... and by limiting themselves to that concept I think they allowed themselves more creativity in a lot of ways- of course that is while remaining a lot more relevant to the show itself. A lot of the clips were amazing- the squirrels, moon man, floop-floopian, and the alien torture to name a few- but I loved the wedge the memories drove between the titular characters and the questions it raised... like just how far has Rick's control over Morty's life gone? Then the twist of them losing their memories in the middle of the viewings allowed them to try to establish their relationship by doing nothing other than keep watching the memories. Of course, this being his only context, Morty has an existential breakdown and Rick is inspired by this; so they form a suicide pact. All of this leads up to Summer's perfect delivery of "You guys doing Morty's Mind Blowers?" and the eventual "Oh man, it's a scenario four." This episode offers a great spin on a familiar concept and gives us awesome insights into Rick and Morty themselves, at the same time giving some top notch humor. It ends with an awesome character moment for Summer and a return to "normal". **Five: 3x03 Pickle Rick** The pickle rick episode was highly anticipated, and as expected there was more to him just being a "pickle". Although the simplicity of this "random" change was definitely put to good use as a joke. The psychological aspect of the characters was put center stage for this, and the pay off was amazing. We got such a deep look into where each of the characters in the episode were in terms of their psyche and it wasn't exactly pretty. This was a really good play for an episode early in a season based around this exact type of themes. By the end, in true Rick and Morty fashion, things got dark when Beth and Rick finally let their feelings out... and slightly darker when you realize Morty and Summer never got to. **Four: 3x01 The Rickshank Rickdemption** Season Three started off very high. Just to name a few things, we got a tease at Rick's back story, the schezuan sauce bit, the reveal that Rick's backstory was just a way of fucking with the federation and his way of breaking out of prison, the collapse of the council of Ricks at our Rick's hand, and his manipulation of the family- causing a season arc of sorts revolving around divorce and imposing his will on others to put himself on top. **Three: 1x10 Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind** The introduction of the council of Ricks: this is a big one. The concept was great, and the conflict between our Rick and Morty and the "evil" Rick and Morty made for a very entertaining episode. This is also one of the first episodes where we see just how much Rick cares about Morty, whether he admits it or not. All of this was done well enough to put the episode super high up on its own merit, but the ending reveal that the Rick was being controlled by "Evil Morty", who seems to be an evil genius with his own motives, was executed incredibly. That song, tho... **Two: 1x06 Rick Potion #9** This was when I knew the show would be an all time favorite for me. A classic if a bit generic Rick and Morty premise which blows up as usual is apparently the plot. But things just get worse and worse, no matter what Rick tries. To the point where things get apocalyptic. The world get's fucked beyond repair, and while it's shocking to see it go so far the show is still relatively new... you think you know the pattern: Rick will figure things out in the end. Of course, as we all know, instead he just takes Morty and bails. They find a reality where the world is saved, and they happen to die around the same time. There are infinite realities, after all. So, along with an amazing background song, they bury their corpses and return to their "normal" lives, with the last image being Morty's blank and traumatized stare. It's hard to top. **One: 3x07 The Ricklantis Mixup** I literally love every little detail about this episode. I love that despite the title and set up, we never see Atlantis. As for the "Tales from the Citadel" stuff... like the Jerry Daycare and the Interdimensional cable box, this is such a brilliant concept within the context of the universe. We not only get an insight to a purely Rick and Morty world, but we see a decent depiction of real life struggles- political, social, cultural, and the familiar plight of the working class. These are explored through the stories of separate Ricks and Mortys who are making their way in a world that is re-building itself in a lot of ways- but one that has a lot of problems just like any society. Each of these stories have some amazing jokes, but what makes this episode so great for me is the way that it ties in the familiar problems and personal struggle in a way that ends up in a depressing but personal ending for each storyline. Of course, the big plot of the episode is the one that ties them all together, the rise of a Morty to become president of all Ricks and Mortys. And though many are already suspecting it, the reveal that it is Evil Morty and the foreshadowing of his plans now that he has changed everything is possibly the single most breathtaking scene in the show. There was something else, too... oh yeah... That song, tho...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Another Unnecessary Appreciation Post</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-21 07:16:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right off the bat, I'm drunk and emotional right now. It feels like all my posts to this sub are like this, but I was just watching some AMVs for the 2011 anime and I just wanted to communicate how I feel. I've grown up on fiction. From books to movies to shows to cartoons and even to video games and music, if there's a story that interests me I go deep. From major things like Star Wars to the most out there and unheard of shit, I've had a ton of obsessions in my life. I loved Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh as a kid (and a bit older Yu Yu Hakisho), but it wasn't until the past three or four years of my life that I really got into anime (I'm 25 now). And I've seen some amazing stuff. Some of my favorite stories out there are anime. If I were to objectively rate them all, HxH would probably not make the #1 spot (though it is in the top 5 for sure)... but there is something about it that separates it from the rest. To be short, the story and characters of HxH have cemented themselves as some of the best and most personal for me. Like the shit I grew up on like Tolkien, Star Wars, and even Pokemon, Hunter X Hunter has become something that I think I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I was never a popular child in school, and dealt with a home-life that was hard to cope with for me (don't get me wrong I had it better than so many people out there, my specific situations just added to the overwhelming need to escape)... so there were seriously times where all I had in life to be happy about were the stories I was engrossed in. And while thing have gotten better in a lot of ways, I also still deal with a lot of this separation from the "real" life around me and a need to escape from it. So when I say that HxH is one of the greatest stories I've ever felt a part of, in a lot of ways I'm saying that HxH is one of the things that has kept me going through some dark times in my head. I really planned on going much deeper into specifics of the story and how they have affected me, but to reiterate I am pretty drunk and honestly feel like I have rambled on enough. Therefore, this post is even more pointless than I originally thought it might be- I'd apologize, but at least I was upfront about the fact that this post is nothing big or new. I just love Hunter X Hunter and will carry this story with me forever.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>You guys should check out "The Good Place".</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-30 00:15:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, been a very long time since I posted here! I absolutely loved following Wilfred and coming here for discussion during the run of the show and after the big ending. I'm back because I've been watching the new show on NBC "The Good Place", and while some of you may already be familiar I've thought about Wilfred a few times while watching and wanted to come here specifically to make the recommendation. For those of you who are not familiar, "The Good Place" takes place in the afterlife, and follows Eleanor; she has died and is sent to the "good place" (heaven of sorts) after having lived a less than virtuous life so to speak. Comedy and chaos ensues. It can be fun to go into with nothing, but to those of you who want to see the preview [here you go.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfBgT5djaQw amp;t) The style and tone is not as dark as Wilfred, and does have a pretty different feel over all. However, both shows get bit deeper than you would expect and both have a very strong finale for the first season. Season two of "The Good Place" is airing now and I am absolutely loving it. Like I said they are pretty different so I'm sure some of you won't love it as much as I did, especially if you go into it expecting another "Wilfred" experience- but if you are a fan of Wilfred I at least think this one is worth checking out. Some strong points I think you will appreciate: * Deals with the idea of death and what comes after * Delves into philosophical ideologies and morality * Handles its characters and their growth very well (for the most part) * Takes one or two unexpected turns in plot * Some great moments of true emotion * A unique concept that creates some interesting situations Well that's my bit, hopefully some of you find this show entertaining and get some joy out of it. Sorry for getting a bit off topic, just wanted to share this with the fanbase of Wilfred. *edited for some grammatical errors.*</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers] Even more evidence that a popular theory about a certain "evil" character is the actual truth.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-31 08:17:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, so obviously I'm talking about Evil Morty. And the theory I am refering to is the one that Evil Morty was the original Morty of the Rick that this show is following. This theory is already a popular one, but I saw something the other day that straight up convinced me that this is what is going on. The scene I'm referring to is in bold below, but for context I am first going to go over the clue that I have seen discussed the most. One of the biggest pieces of evidence that I have seen people mention for this theory is from the episode that first features "Evil Morty". When Rick is being shown his memories on screen, there is a shot where he sees a baby Morty in his arms. Now this is seen as evidence based on the fact that Rick has been out of the lives of the C-137 Smith family for 20 years, so he wouldn't have been around to see THIS Morty as a baby. Now this one example alone could just have been oversight, but like I said I did notice another big piece of evidence. **And here it is: As I was re-watching episode 2x05 "Get Schwifty", I noticed something about the scene with Bird Person. Morty is looking at pictures of Rick when he is younger, and he sees one where Rick is holding him as a baby. This scene has an important feel to it, like they were making a point of showing this to us viewers. And how does Morty react? He asks "What's that? Who's that baby?" Now it should seem pretty obvious it's baby Morty to us, but I realized how telling it is that Morty had to ask who that baby was. It is again because Rick wasn't around when he was that age, so seeing that confused him. Of course the question is ignored and the scene continues.** This being added on to the evidence we had before has pretty much convinced me that Evil Morty is THIS Rick's original grandson. I'm going to lay out all the evidence together now, with my take on it, and then go over the implications of what it will mean. So the first scene, in which Rick sees the memory of baby Morty, shows that Rick tears up when he sees the memory. Taking in consideration what we know of Rick as a character, he has not been extremely sentimental in the past. At least I don't think he's the type of person to get emotional looking at old pictures/memories. Plus, he looks truly sad in this scene. I think it makes way more sense if something truly tragic happened with his original Morty, and seeing the memory brought up THAT feeling again. Now, the scene that I mentioned comes in season two. This alone is big in my mind, because they didn't include Evil Morty in this season. The creators have said that they want the show to be episodic in nature, but they do want to include an over-arching story for the viewers that *pay attention*. They gave us Evil Morty in season one, and now a full season later they include this subtle reference to the idea that Rick had been around for a Morty during his early years- this time, however, it seems to do this while specifically alluding to the idea that THIS Morty did not have a Rick in his life at that time. At that point, I don't think there's any way it's just an oversight anymore. It seems the writing for the show has made things pretty clear: * For the C-137 Smith family, Rick has been gone for 20 years. * Morty is confused by the identity of "baby Morty" in the picture with Rick * Rick has memories of Morty as a baby that have a strong emotional resonance within him. I think the implication is pretty clear, and now in season 3 we have a big return of Evil Morty, and very clear foreshadowing that he will be important to "our" Rick and Morty in the future. Another fun little parallel here: In season 3, Evil Morty is asked about his original Rick... and just like when Morty asks Bird Person about the baby in the photo, the question is avoided not just by the person being asked but by the show itself. Now the theory is popular and some people think it will be too predictable. I disagree. It mostly seems predictable because the internet has discussed in in depth like I am now. Also, I think this is the part of the story we are meant to be able to figure out. They want to reward the fans who pay attention, so if we are looking for some deeper meaning to the story this is not meant to be a surprise. I think the reveal of this situation, the way it plays out, and the actually history of it will be the part that may surprise us. I mean not only does the idea of what made this Morty "evil" have potential to be big, but the idea behind his intelligence is also crazy; the whole "a cocky Morty can lead to bad things" quote makes it sound like every Morty has the same potential. Not 100% confirmation but it seems to insinuate that to me. However, there is a deeper implication here that I have not seen much discussion on: if this theory is true, and "Evil Morty" is this Rick's original grandson... does that mean he is not the same Rick who left our Morty's family 20 years ago? Maybe whatever happened to make Evil Morty go bad involved C-137 Rick somehow- maybe even killing him. The situation was so bad that that Morty's Rick had to bail, and maybe came to C-137 Morty not just to try again with a different Morty but also because he felt responsible for the death of C-137. Of course that is purely speculation, but it definitely shows how much there still is we don't know about this "twist".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I think this is shaping up to be a very good season.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-18 06:26:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>To be fair I was never one of the people who disliked the later seasons, but I will admit I feel like the show peaked a bit in seasons 2-4. Season 7 was a bit closer to those seasons for me, but even when Shameless isn't at it's "peak" I love watching it. The characters, humor, and nature of Shameless leave very little room for what I'd call a "bad" season. All that aside, I think season 8 is actually shaping up to be better than 7 for me, and it might even end up being my favorite since season 4 aired. One big factor is that the humor has been landing more than ever for me, every episode has had a few things crack me up. But I also love what we're seeing in some of the characters. They're all growing in very compelling ways this season, for better or worse. Especially in tonight's episode, I think we're starting to go in a very emotional direction this year. While I always enjoyed the comedy and the characters, Shameless was at it's best for me when it effectively throws you a healthy dose of "feels". And in terms of that emotion and comedy, this season is hitting every note. Obviously we're only about half-way, and a lot can still happen. But if the first half is any indicator, this is going to be one of the better seasons for me. For shits and giggles, I'll even whip up a ranking of approximately where it stands: 1. Season Three 2. Season Four (neck and neck with three) 3. Season Two 4. Season One 5. (Season 8 Maybe?) 6. Season Seven 7. Season Five (neck and neck with seven) 8. Season Six</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers] What were the 5 most emotional moments for you?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-28 09:25:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>For me: 5) Gon and Ging talking on the world tree. "You should enjoy the little detours... too the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want." Just typing that out actually chokes me up a bit. 4) Killua and Gon part ways. Something about the way their smiles fade as they turn away from each other always gets me. 3) Killua tells something to go away. For some reason it didn't make as much of an impression during my first watch through, but literally the first time I rewatched the show it destroyed me. Whoever the voice actor for something is really knows how to play with my heart strings. 2) In episode 131, as soon as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3Me4qPTY8 amp;t=0m30s) music starts playing until the very end. Everything from that music to the voice acting is perfect. And the animation of Killua's [expressions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb5Z8E0MoLY amp;t=13m49s) is so emotional for me. 1) 135. Need I say more? So many trigger lines for me in that episode... but damn, the one that always kills me: "Will you call me... by my name one last time?" So what about you guys? Interested in the moments that hit you in the feels g-spot. Feel free to talk about some of the "less talked about" moments that were emotional for you, as well. There are a lot of them, I kind of feel bad for my top 5 being a bit obvious...</TEXT>

I haven't seen much on here as of late, but if those leaks already were discussed a bunch I can see the possibility that it wouldn't be littered across the page anymore. Or maybe they were never 100% certain anyway, that's why they aren't being talked about?

    <TITLE>[Spoilers] What makes Pitou an empathetic character</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-24 04:53:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I came across the question of why people would care about Pitou or in some cases support her character. I liked the question and the way it made me analyze her character, so I wanted to share that analysis. There won't be new information for most of you guys, and this might not be a radically different view from a lot of your own. However the question does get asked, and while I do not set out to change anyone's mind, I very much enjoy having others *understand* the other point of view. Plus, I love reading other peoples' analysis of HxH, so maybe you will just enjoy this for what it is. --- --- The point I want to start with is in relation to the Chimera Ants in general. A huge part of the CA arc is how the human ego impacts these creatures, in both positive in negative ways. For example, it allows for the ants to become self-serving, egotistic, and emotional- but also at times empathetic and even sometimes caring. However, on the other side of this, all the ants are born with several very non-human characteristics. They are loyal to the Queen or King in a way that is biologically ingrained in their animal makeup. Let's take the "humanity" out of the picture. When animals sense danger, especially to their family (including the Queen/King), they will take out that danger. A lion will kill other animals without question to feed its young. The ants have a human side, yes, but all of this is still what they are BORN with. I love the symbolism of Kite saving Gon as a child in relation to this arc... he scolds Gon for entering THEIR territory when they are KNOWN to be dangerous- and this is exactly how Kite "dies" when they approach the nest. They were entering the territory of a dangerous species that would perceive their actions as a threat to what they are protecting and nourishing. The last thing I want to bring up before specifically talking about Pitou is human empathy. Our empathy and morality is not something that happens overnight. We learn over YEARS what "right" and "wrong" is. Even after years of life, human children will still bite, kick, and hit if they are angry. It takes growing through experience and living with others to learn true empathy and compassion for others, and to determine your own moral code. Finally, this brings me to Pitou. When she is introduced, it is very clear she is a villain. Her character design is creepy, her aura is dark, but it is her first actions that put her in the role of a villain. The first things she does are to probe a living person's brain for information and then kill a beloved protagonist. From this point on, it's understandable that many people would just be ready for Gon to kick her ass and hate her. However, she had only been alive for a day at this point. No matter how linguistic, logical, or advanced she was, she had NO time to develop any of her human empathy or feelings. Her actions at that point were very animal. Of course she was going to kill a threat to her King. The change in Meruem's character is a part of HxH that put in display by the CA arc, and we SEE that growth of empathy in him. He starts off listening only to his animal instincts- i.e. eating children. But slowly, through EXPERIENCE and TIME with Komugi, he becomes empathetic. Pitou's development is not a main focal point of any story arc, so it's not as easy to see. But it is there if you look. Meruem's decision to play games and keeping the "champions" alive until he defeated them gave him the opportunity to spend time with a human and relate. Pitou does not have this same opportunity, and for most of the arc she is following her animal side. I think the palace invasion is where the first time the human side begins to affect her. It all starts when she finds the King holding Komugi. It is very much stressed how she can read his emotions before she even sees him, and can feel his emotions through his aura. This seems to affect her a lot, and I think this is where she starts to realize that apart from her insane loyalty, she cares that the King is sad- and that her caring goes beyond loyalty and into the territory of "love". Love is a very human thing. The King, without any threat, asks Pitou to heal Komugi in such desperation, and says that he is counting on her (which feels more like a friend asking for help than a King making a command), and Pitou *cries*. I think that is a huge indicator that something has changed in her. When Gon comes across her healing Komugi, Pitou explains that she is doing it because Komugi is "important to someone who is important to her", and that without her the King will cease to be who he is. Not even an hour before any of this, she had told Pouf that she was okay with killing Komugi if she became a weakness to the king. She is clearly operating in a very different way at this point, and it gives credit to the idea that her witnessing the King in pain triggered her human side to grow. Her interactions with Gon as she heals Komugi are another big factor for her growth, I believe. She sees up close and personal, in a way that drastically affects her, how much pain and anger her actions brought to Gon. While at first, all she could think about on the surface was how to survive while still healing Komugi, I think Gon's pain sinks in for her. To go a bit further, I believe she connects his pain of losing someone to the King's pain over Komugi, which she had JUST felt herself. From this point until her death, she does not show Gon any malice at all. She wants to kill him, but only because she still perceives him as a threat to the King. She takes no pleasure in the idea. We see this again in a big way when she reveals that Kite is dead. She explains the whole thing respectfully to Gon, and she seems to be genuinely sad about what she is saying. She remembers him and what she did, and she tells him she is sorry. NONE of this was necessary, she could have just killed Gon as soon as she found out the "Pouf had Komugi". Instead, she respects him and his pain, as if she understands it. When Gon collapses, his mind literally breaking, the look Pitou has when she watches is very sad. It is clear that when she acts to kill him, it is not as an evil being or with malice. It is her not only doing what the animal loyalty she has requires, but she is also protecting a *friend* in the King (friend may be much, family may be more appropriate). When she is killed, her last thoughts are how she is glad that it is her and not the King dying. I think the bottom line reason that she can be empathetic is this growth in her personality. I think people tend to take more joy in her death than the King because in Meruem's case, his arc is centered around this change. His role is to change and die with love in his heart. Pitou's role is very different, she is there as an antagonist in Gon's storyline... but being created by Togashi, she is still an extremely well written character and that change is THERE. Along with not being a big focal point of the arc, her growth just didn't have as much time and circumstance as Meruem. I think if she had been left alive, we would have continued to see a lot of Growth, and that she had potential to even become moral. I have always seen some tragedy in her death. Of course what she did was horrible, but she had just begun to learn and grow. She was essentially an extremely functional child starting to learn right from wrong, and died extremely loyal to the one she loved. This in essence is what I think makes her empathetic as a character, and it's why I "care" that she dies.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-25 10:03:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know what I want this post to be, I just haven't been able to explain any of this to anyone I know personally. I'm just lost, and I'm not sure where to turn. I was raised in the southern US under unorthodox parenting and schooling, where creativity and individuality were encouraged along with love and compassion. Of course this environment breeds people who think outside the box and in turn question the things around them instead of accept it blindly. As I grew older, I developed a more "artistic" personality. I've been writing since I was a small child. Whether or not I'm any good, it's the only thing I've ever really been able to do or find any "purpose" in. When I hit my rebellious teen years, I found fundamental "issues" in everything- the government, school, society as a whole, all of it was flawed. While there was truth in what I saw, I think I was just realizing that life here would never be what I was raised to believe it could be... and that I was most likely just looking for any excuse to fight back. Inevitably I dropped out of high school and started to experiment with drugs. I had been exposed to weed and some pharmaceuticals in high school (particularly downers like xanax or hydrocodone), but I became very curious about the psychedelic experience. Some of my strongest experiences were a series of dxm trips shared with a friend of mine. It had been a legal and available high, but it also was my first introduction to hallucinogens. Once I began to experiment with LSD and psilocybin, I separated even further from "regular society". At first I abused them, as I had with most drugs before, but over the years I learned to respect them so much more. Despite dropping out of high school, I did actually end up starting college. I had no interest in college prior to this, but I had a friend who ended up going somewhere out of state and amazing and I had to follow. It was an incredible experience, one full of creativity, amazing people, nature (it was a farm college in the mountains, absolutely beautiful) and some of the best psychedelic experiences I've ever had. It was the best year of my life, and I was not only writing more than ever but living with purpose- but of course reality eventually hit. They raised the tuition the following year, and even on top of the loans I qualified for and financial aid my family was already struggling to help with the rest... I was unceremoniously kicked out, with the accounting office not even answering or returning calls to my parents to figure out what could be done. Instead, they just put a letter in my student post box saying to be out by the end of the week. Once I returned home, I turned back to the downers I had relied on in high school. I developed a habit of needing something to bring me down every night, and this led to an addiction to painkillers. Since then I went to school for computer programming, but there was no passion to drive me and I couldn't keep my grades up. That's when I started waiting tables, and I honestly loved it. It was more money than other part time work, and for some reason I'm really good with people. I also enjoyed taking care of people and giving them a good time while they were out, and this was a job where my pay was dictated by how well I did that. I thought that maybe this could lead to a career in the service industry, and now I'm back at community college taking classes for hospitality management. But the lifestyle is starting to wear on me, and working in restaurants has only increased my drug intake. Though I occasionally have some amazing experiences with hallucinogens, my drug use has turned into taking downers and lying in bed. Someone close to me said something the other day that hit pretty close to home- he said that he was reading a book by a survivor of the nazi concentration camps, and it described one factor in everyone who was able to survive: it was purpose. With all of the horror that was happening, the ones who were able to preserver were the ones who could wake up every day with a purpose to keep going. And I feel like this is true in life, after all what's the point in any of this if you don't have a purpose? After twenty five years, I'm facing the fact that the society I live in is built around money and materialism. And I've fallen into it, I tune out every night and dull my mind while watching netflix on my Smart TV. But I grew up without any ties to it, and abandoned a search for a "career". In the past couple of years, I've written less than any other time in my life. The only time I'm not depressed is when I travel, and I would love to see the world. But I don't know how, I have no valuable skills or education to get me into a good position of power, and a considerable amount of debt tying me to this place. If I just left the country, my parents who co-signed my loans would be responsible for that. I don't know what I want from anything, but I'm afraid that I don't have a purpose. The only true calling I have is not something that can sustain me in this society... And I have nothing else to guide me in supporting myself here. And I see what's happening in our country lately- our current president is trying to make it even harder by helping the rich while further hurting students and part time workers. I'm starting to be afraid that I don't have what it takes to survive here. I've lost passion for everything. I don't care enough to work so hard just to come home and get high. I've had some spiritual development in my life, but every time, like clockwork, I eventually sink back into this cycle of medication and tuning out. I just want to see the world. I want to travel around, writing songs and poetry for my own fulfillment. I'm not lazy, I work hard, but the monotony of doing the same thing day after day just to sustain a life without meaning is draining me. I've even considered suicide, but I couldn't do that to my family- I probably wouldn't have nerve to go through with it anyway. And when I hit that point, where the idea of dying sounds like an easy way out, I think- why not just leave? If I can't find meaning in this society to the point where death is an option, why not sacrifice everything to just leave. I could spend the rest of my life sick, poor, and on the streets and die alone, but I could do it while seeing more of this world than I am now. I know this all sounds melodramatic, and it is... I should probably talk to a psychiatrist, I've been told by SO many people I'm depressed and should be on medication. I was on anti-depressants for a month or so, but I hated the entire time. I felt awful every second of it. I know I'm just an entitled kid complaining about "how hard life is", but I think the fact is that I'm just now realizing that I in no way want to be a part of the life we have here. I want change, and I don't know where to go from here. I know change is something you must do for yourself, and I do understand the idea that nobody controls your happiness but you. Am I crazy for feeling incapable of happiness trapped where I am? I know this is just a long post of ranting, and I'm not sure how appropriate it actually is for this sub. I welcome advice if you have it, but most of all if you read this- any of this... thank you. Mostly I just haven't been able to vocalize this to anyone in my life, and I needed an outlet for all of what I've been feeling. Thank you for your time, and I sincerely hope all of you are well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Some spoilers] Little moment I absolutely love in Civil War.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-09 06:19:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>In this scene [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DESwBLlniCg amp;t=2m55s), Peter gives this universe's take on the whole 'great power great responsibility' thing. The thing I noticed, though, is the look on Tony's face when Peter says "when you can do things I do, and you don't, and THEN the bad stuff happens... it happens because of you". The face Tony makes after this really hits me in the feels. The quote seems to really resonate with him on an emotional level. For some reason, it just now dawned on me that this obviously took him back to how he felt in Age of Ultron. When Wanda put the vision in Tony's head of the Avengers all dead at the hands of unknown forces, the whole movie he is terrified at the idea of not being able to protect them from what is next. He sees it as his responsibility, not only because of the weapons he used to create but also his creating of the Avengers themselves- which is a whole new type of weapon. He refers to it as the "end of the path he started them on", and feels like it is his responsibility to prevent something worse from happening. This lead him to create Ultron, and was a huge motivating factor for him in Civil War. You just know that when Peter said that stuff, it hit Tony hard (and you can really see it because of RDJ's amazing skill as an actor). He is seeing himself in Peter, and it is that very sentiment that drives him to feel responsible for the calamities to come (Thanos in the HOWSE). I know this is pretty obvious, but I just noticed this connection between the two characters and I really wanted to share it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[MCU SPOILERS] Finished my third full rewatch of Civil War. Liked it more each time. Here are some thoughts:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-12 10:40:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have to admit, I was ever so slightly disappointed when I saw Captain America: Civil War in theaters. There are a few factors at play for that; for one, I ate too many weed edibles, which made the movie intense but also a little hard to follow at times. Also, I was way beyond hype for the movie, to the point where I was basically expecting it to be an Avengers movie. While it had elements of that, it certainly wasn't one, and wasn't supposed to be. I remember being a little let down by this, and feeling like it peaked at the airport scene while the rest of the movie failed to live up to that part. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the movie, it just didn't match my hype. When I watched it again, I had a clearer head and went into it more as a Captain America movie and I enjoyed it a whole lot more. There were so many awesome things about the movie, and after a rewatch I realized it was in my top three. I've recently rewatched the whole MCU, only skipping a couple I had seen very recently- Civil War, for some reason, was one of them. It wasn't that recent that I had seen it, but for some reason it was still really fresh in my head. I just watched it again, and I can honestly say that it is my favorite film of the MCU. After having seen so many of the other movies in order recently, there was just so much to appreciate in this movie... and I'm so much more into Cap's character in the MCU than I was last time, and so this felt like an amazing movie for him. It was the perfect end to his solo-film arc. And it really was his biggest challenge. This time, I loved the whole movie to the point where I wonder if even Infinity War can challenge it (I hope to eat that sentence later, seeing is IW is bigger than anything yet and is also helmed by the Russo brothers). There were so many things I appreciated in this re-watch, and for the sake of simplicity I'll just list a lot of what really stands out to me. Note: As much as I want to rant, everyone and mother has explained why they love some of the stuff in this movie- like the airport scene, spidey/panther's inclusion, how well the debate was done between all the heroes and how natural their opinions felt, and so on. These are all obviously a big part of why this is my favorite MCU film, but not what I want to talk about. * The first scene (after the intro scene) is incredibly well done. It shows how the Avengers go about "normal" business, brings back a familiar face for an antagonist, and sports an amazing sequence of action and "ability-combos" with brilliant choreography. Not unheard of for an MCU movie, but it is impressively well tied with the root conflicts of the film (a person with a vendetta against the Avengers who is willing to put others in danger AND the fact that the Avengers are in a foreign nation implementing their own "justice") and it leads beautifully into the emotional payoff that sets the rest of the movie up: the reveal of Bucky's involvement and the accident that causes the deaths of many innocent lives. So not only does the movie kick off with amazing fast paced action, it jumps right into the heart of the conflict in an emotinally satisfying way. * RDJ tears it up in this movie. His performance of Tony's pain is I think his best of the series. The guilt he feels (his weapons, Ultron, the battles of the Avengers), his separation from Pepper, the accords themselves and the divide of the Avengers, his relationship with Steve and of course the heavy stuff with his parents. This, along with several movies developing who he is now put him in a unique position in these movies. He wasn't a villain, but in this Captain America movie he WAS the antagonist, but he was one who was compelling emotionally and was making a lot of sense- not to mention this is a character built up for a long time that we already have loved. This kind of antagonist is rare in super hero movies. * I really appreciated more this time was how fluidly they took such a big conflict and brought in everyone while keeping it a Captain America storyline- ultimately bringing it back in to him. It all came down to his choice: His country and the Avengers, or doing the right thing by his oldest friend. He sacrificed everything to do what he thought was right. And now the climax of the movie, which I used to think didn't live up to the airport, is now easily one of the best climaxes in a movie for me. Not only is the last fight with Bucky, Cap, and Iron Man intense and impressively shot/executed, but it is charged with so much finality and emotion. RDJ and Evan's performances make this intense on so many levels. We have Cap fighting to protect his friend and Tony is full of grief and anger after learning what really happened to his parents, betrayed by what Rogers kept from him, and despair over how the team had been ripped apart. It's amazing film for Stark, but of course it all comes down to Cap and his final choice- throwing down the shield and leaving the Avengers to do what's right in his mind. It's a great action sequence with a heartbreaking conclusion. The last thing I want to mention is what stood out to me the most during this viewing. Since this movie released, I have heard many times that the film's biggest weakness was the villain, Zemo. Now, he is by far one of my favorites. Yes, the core conflict of this movie were the issues with the Avengers and Zemo was NOT necessary in showing these. However, he is the embodiment of the whole conflict. He is a direct victim of the destruction left behind on the battlefield of the Avengers, just a normal guy who lost everything because of these crazy forces that now exit. But why is he one of my favorites? I find him well acted and written, yes (even if he is a subtle aspect of the movie), but what I've grown to love about him comes down to what he is and what he accomplished. Other than a man connections to follow and a lot of grief, he is very normal. In fact, his the most "normal" villain we have had yet. He has no powers, no top-tier technology, no history of war and strategy (other than what little knowledge he has picked up), and no ties to cosmic or supernatural forces. He's just some guy with a very understandable and emotional reason to hate the Avengers. He's no genius, but he is smart... and that's the thing, he was smart enough to think differently than everyone else who took on the Avengers. He was able to take what was already there and use that to let THEM do the job for him. And THAT is the thing... This normal guy who lost everything is the only villain so far to actually defeat the Avengers. He never took them on in a physical fight, and only interacted with them a couple times, but he actually won. I mean let's look at what he wanted to do. He decided that, instead of fighting the Avengers, he would use their differences and their own fragile relationship with the governments of the world to have them destroy themselves. It required a different perspective to attempt this, but it's not some crazy genius scheme. His determination, however, allowed him to take what he had and use it- and he accomplished what he wanted to do. Let's look at the results: Captain American no longer exists, he is now a fugitive along with Natasha and Sam. They are doing what they can, yes (out of the US if I am not mistaken), but they are certainly no longer Avengers. Rhodes is currently seriously injured and out of commission (for now), Vision and Wanda have a lot to work through now and Wanda especially does not have great public relations, Hawkeye is retired again, Hulk and Thor have been gone, and Tony seems to be working alone to escape a threat he senses to be coming. Everyone else is either alone or a fugitive or both. The Russo brothers have said that they wanted to do Civil War because they wanted the Avengers to be divided and not at all in unity when the ultimate threat comes. For all purposes as of now, that is how they are and the Avengers are no more. They have actually been defeated and stopped for the first time. --- **TL;DR on my biggest point** **Zemo is now one of my favorite villains: he has no powers, abilities or crazy technology... just a compelling past that causes him a lot of grief and pain, with only the Avengers for him to blame. So, as a completely normal guy, he single handedly uses the state of the Avengers and the World to successfully tear them apart and defeat them for the first time.***</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are your ten favorite moments in any of the MCU movies?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-27 02:26:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>It can be anything from a five second segment to an entire action sequence. Remember, these are just your personal favorite moments, not necessarily what you think was objectively "done the best". For me: Ten: [Ant Man vs. Falcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABpZl0KG4mI): I love crossovers between franchises, and I loved every second of this interaction. Nine: [Doctor Strange in Ragnarok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9fFPLrO3RU): Another great crossover, it was very comedic while also greatly increasing my respect for Strange. Eight: [Iron Man and Cap team up for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcgJvJqCdrw): Badass entrance. Seven: [The highway sequence in Winter Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXPOl6EjbWg): The choreography is on point, and the tension builds so beautifully up to Bucky's reveal. Six: [This scene with Thor, Cap, and Iron Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2KrQgjU0ZM): This was basically the fight sequence I never knew I needed so badly. Five: [Yondu's arrow scene in Guardians Vol 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXbFP2V_zSA): The Guardians movies are so good at timing action sequences to their amazing soundtrack, and to me this was the apex of that. Four: [The rise of Sokovia and Ultron's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK940jKvIOY): This scene was just so epic to me, and Ultron's "meteor" speech is some of my favorite dialogue in the series. Three: [Ultron and Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiwlOQseLOY): Just a really well written scene between these two characters. Two: [The car scene from Homecoming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkXDR9i4ic): And I am counting the lead up to this scene too, everything from when Peter knocks on the door and Toomes answers. This scene is executed so well, I don't really feel like going into all the things I love about it right here. One: [Airport scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X8Mlrxk1Cg amp;list=PLSa-fSDwZtheUxSAuZ9M6OG5CmiuroRf_): Airport sequence. It's a comic book nerd's wet dream. I don't know what else to say.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My theory and hope as to how this series continues to an end.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-11 00:34:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>My theory is based on the few few arcs of Hunter X Hunter. In the very first, the Hunter Exam, the entire series is pretty much set up. What a Hunter is, how the main characters become involved with them and how it relates to the overall story, and especially the main character's motivation throughout the whole thing. The basic plot that is established boils down to Gon's desire to become a Hunter and find his father. But I feel like we can simplify it a bit more; the story is Gon searching (or hunting) for what he doesn't know. I'll touch on this a bit more later, but the point is that the first arc serves to set this story up, and allow it to be the over-stretching plot of Hunter X Hunter. Of course, HxH is known and praised for its ability to explore a wide array of stories, plots, and large arcs throughout its course... and while each has its own conflicts and very distinct tone, they are all connected in some way by the original over-arching plot. However, in the first couple arcs after the exam, there are a few *main* story lines that are almost as important as the central story of the series. **Zoldyk Family** sets up the dynamic of the Zoldyk family, and how important Killua is to them. Especially with later events in the series, their relationship with Killua is very unresolved and will undoubtedly be a big factor later on. **Heaven's Arena** Set up Gon's fierce desire to become stronger, along with training in nen, both of which become a huge driving force for the rest of the series. Hisoka, I believe, is used in this arc as a symbol for where Gon wants to get to in his own strength. This arc also ends by establishing Killua's goal to follow Gon until he finds something *hew wants*, and as he becomes so close to Gon his search begins to tie very deeply into the story's true plot of Gon's search. And in **Yorkshin City**, we really start to tackle Kurpika's personal vendetta with the Phantom Troupe, as well as the nature of the Troupe itself. We get a great arc that focuses on Kurapika's rage and search (again, hunt) for revenge... and while it ends in a satisfactory way it does NOT resolve this story at all. Kurapika still harbors a bitter rage and the Troupe is (as of NOW) still around. The **Greed Island** and **Chimera Ant** arcs are no longer setting up main over-arching story lines, but testing the characters where they are and their drive to go forward. In particular, the **Chimera Ant** arc acts a climax of these characters. Then, we have the **Election arc**, which seems to resolve a lot. Gon finally meets his father and Killua finds something to do (help his sister). This could be the end, and it works well as one in the 2011 anime... but it isn't. I think that this is the midpoint of that overall story, and Gon and Killua's achievements are only milestones in a bigger picture. They are Hunters... they are obviously always going to be on the hunt for something. Like Ging before him, Gon will continue to search for something beyond his reach. And this *hunt* will be the drive of the series... but because it is everlasting it could potentially take the story on forever. However, I do believe that Hunter X Hunter will have a definitive ending (if Togashi finishes it, with all due respect to that mastermind). Curious about that ending, my theory on the remaining arcs of HxH is based on those first couple arcs that set up the sub-main-plots. I call it a mirror theory, because I feel like the remaining half of the series will use its arcs to complete the story that each of those first arcs set up. We'll start with the **Expedition** arc, which in my theory is very separate from the true **Dark Continent** arc. I believe this will resolve the main plot line with the Phantom Troupe and Krupika's hunt for revenge, mirroring **Yorkshin**. It's already revealed that the last eyes of the kurta are on this ship, along with the Troupe themselves (with Hisoka as a wild card). All the pieces are there to wrap up Kurpika's MAIN arc. With everything going on, I believe the ship will turn into an all out bloodbath, and it will resolve Kurapika's main conflicts once and for all. However, I believe the resulting chaos of what will essentially be war on the ship will cause the entire ship to stay at their first stop to deal with the damage and fallout, delaying the true trip to the dark continent. I believe this will be a moderate to long arc, but it will end around this point. Next, I believe there will be a short **Gon-centric** arc. It will mirror **Heaven's Arena**, as Gon will try to regain his ability to use nen, much like he awoke it at first in **Heaven's Arena**. I believe that when he does accomplish this, he will learn that Don Freecs lives on the Dark Continent and has found an insane power there. Curious to find that power, Gon will desire to reach the DC. Then, there will be a **Killua-centric** arc, where his family attempts to hunt him and Alluka down. Killua, being a prodigy, will not only outsmart them but finally convince them to leave him alone. This will resolve all issues with his family... Except Illumi, who will still secretly harbor a grudge. However, the arc ends with Killua wanting to find the dark continent to discover something about "Something's" true power (since she is from there). This will unite Gon and Killua's separate arcs. This is where the real **Dark Continent** arc begins, as all the main characters meet up where the ship is still harbored, and the journey to the DC is back on. This arc will be the longest of the series, and will in a way mirror the **Chimera Ant** arc... except that instead of being the climax for the first half of the story, this will be the climax for the whole thing. I don't have exact predictions of how this arc will go, but here are just a few small theories I have: * Don Freecs will be the strongest character in the series * There will be ancient secrets about nen discovered there, along with the mysterious symbols and characters that enhance and manipulate Nen * Don may be the villain of the arc. Either way, he will be strongly tied to the aforementioned secret knowledge. Gon will be desperate to uncover the secrets. * It will be the biggest struggle any of them have faced by far. It will be really dark but also heavy on the fantasy elements. After the **Dark Continent** arc, there will be ONE last arc for the story. It will essentially be a *resolution* arc. I expect it will wrap up lose ends of the main plots that have been resolved- stuff with the Hunter Association maybe, or if Kurapika is still alive it could show how he is adapting to a post-revenge life. Leorio as prestigious doctor, so on and so forth. I do expect there to be some action, and I think the resolution arc will have three main fights: Killua vs. Illumi, Gons vs. Hisoka, and Ging vs. Parriston. In my more specific theory, I believe Parriston will obtain some insane force from the Dark Continent and use it to fuck with the world- kind of the way he got himself some Chimera Ant nests to use for his own benefit. Ging will try to stop him, and enlist the help of Killua and Gon. By this point, Gon will be strong enough for Hisoka to want to REALLY challenge, and Parriston will hire Illumi/Hisoka to handle the two of them. Those fights will be the end focal point of the final arc, and it will end with Gon deciding what to hunt next- maybe a voyage back to the DC to learn more. Just theories, but I would honestly like it if it all goes this way (assuming it ever finishes). **TL;DR** **The end of the ELECTION arc is the halfway point. There will be five arcs left in the series. This one, the expedition, which will resolve the story of Kurapika and the spiders but delay the DC voyage for a bit. Then, an arc for Gon to get his nen back and learn about Don Freecs and his father's journey to the DC. Third, an arc for Killua finally dealing with his family's hunt for him and Alluka, resolving issues with his family (except Illumi), but deciding to go with Gon to the DC to discover the secrets of "Something's" power.** **This will all lead to the big climax of the entire series, the DARK CONTINENT, in which ancient secrets about nen and the Freecs family will be revealed. It will be the longest and darkest arc, bigger than the climax of the Chimera Ant arc.** **Then there will be one last arc to wrap everything up with character resolutions and the Hunter Association. Maybe a final battle with Gon vs. Hisoka, Killua vs. Illumi, and Ging Vs. Parriston.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this list ranked only by how much I personally enjoyed watching these villains, so this is of course very subjective. So definitely share your own personal favorites or least favorites, even if you don't want to rank them all. For now, I'm only doing the movies (otherwise you can bet your ass that Kingpin and Killgrave would be super high up on the list). Last minute clarifications: Even though Thanos has appeared in movies, I'm not considering him- saving my judgement until after IW. I am also counting The Winter Soldier (only his brainwashed character in TWS), as well as the Grandmaster as villains. **I may have missed some, but by my count there are 31 villains I can remember from these movies, and without further ado here is my ranking of them- starting with the worst:** --- Thirty-One: Malekith Thirty: Laufey Twenty-Nine: Algrim Twenty-Eight: Justin Hammer Twenty-Seven: Aldrich Killian Twenty-Six: Whiplash Twenty-Five: Iron Monger Twenty-Four: Red Skull Twenty-Three: Arnim Zola Twenty-Two: Dormammu Twenty-One: Crossbones Twenty: Shocker Nineteen: Yellow Jacket Eighteen: Abomination Seventeen: Alexander Pierce Sixteen: Kaecilius Fifteen: Surtur Fourteen: Tinkerer Thirteen: Ronan the Accusor Twelve: Hela Eleven: Ayesha, Leader of the Sovereign Ten: Ulysses Klaue Nine: Ego, the Living Planet Eight: Ultron Seven: Nebula Six: The Grandmaster Five: Helmut Zemo Four: The Winter Soldier Three: Vulture Two: Killmonger One: Loki --- **Okay, Thanos. I'm expecting you to DESTROY this list on the 26th. Let's do this shit.** **edit: originally wrote "human planet", not "Ego the Living Planet".**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ranking my favorite heroes from the MCU from worst to best!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-18 08:42:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>So in honor of Thanos and his big upcoming film, I recently ranked my favorite villains of the MCU from worst to best. I decided I should do the same for the heroes we've come to love. Based only how much I personally enjoy them. Over the past ten years we have a lot of amazing heroes to grow to love... and very soon they may not all be with us anymore. This time, I decided to include some of the big ones from the television shows as well (I have not seen Runaways or Inhumans, so I won't be including any of the heroes from those shows). So here we go. Feel free to share your rankings as well! ___ ___ **HEROES OF THE MCU RANKED FROM LOWEST TO HIGHEST:** **Forty:** Iron Fist **Thirty-Nine:** Quicksilver **Thirty-Eight:** Elektra **Thirty-Seven:** Stick **Thirty-Six:** War Machine **Thirty-Five:** Gamora **Thirty-Four:** Peggy Carter **Thirty-Three:** Okoye **Thirty-Two:** Scarlet Witch **Thirty-One:** Wong **Thirty:** Yondu **Twenty-Nine:** Mordo **Twenty-Eight:** Vision **Twenty-Seven:** Luke Cage **Twenty-Six:** Daisy Johnson/Quake **Twenty-Five:** Hawkeye **Twenty-Four:** Drax **Twenty-Three:** Nick Fury **Twenty-Two:** Mantis **Twenty-One:** Ghost Rider **Twenty:** Shuri **Nineteen:** Falcon **Eighteen:** Bucky Barnes **Seventeen:** Punisher **Sixteen:** Black Widow **Fifteen:** Phil Coulson **Fourteen:** Hulk **Thirteen:** Daredevil **Twelve:** Loki **Eleven:** Star-Lord **Ten:** Thor **Nine:** Groot **Eight:** Rocket **Seven:** Jessica Jones **Six:** Ant-Man **Five:** Captain America **Four:** Iron Man **Three:** Spider-Man **Two:** Black Panther **One:** Doctor Strange ........... **HONORABLE MENTION: M'BAKU. I SOMEHOW FORGOT TO INCLUDE HIM IN ALL OF THIS, AND I'M TOO LAZY TO GO BACK AND FIX ALL OF THIS. JUST KNOW THAT I FUCKING LOVE HIM AND HE WOULD BE IN THE TOP TWENTY FOR SURE.** --- --- Note: I like every character listed. The bottom two I find a little less than compelling, but even them I don't really *dislike*. So for the most part, it was very hard to order all of this. And so many of these characters are very, very dear to me. For example I fucking LOVE Hawkeye and he's in 25th place, so... yeah this was hard. Especially my top five... seriously, the **top five are all practically tied**. Let me know what you think, curse me for my opinion and share your own  lt;3 love you guys, hope everyone enjoys Infinity War when that shit hits us like a tidal wave.</TEXT>

But over all of my rewatches, I've started to get annoyed with him in various circumstances. To start, he kind of sucks at his job. On the surface he's agreeable and tries to help people when he can. However, on a much deeper level, it's obvious he doesn't care about his job. It's not just that he seems to have no passion for his work, because that applies to many others as well. He overall just doesn't take things very seriously, and while in that particular office that makes sense a lot of the time he is human resource- he needs to take things way more seriously. Though Dwight is obviously crazy a lot of the time, it was really unprofessional to not file any of his complaints against Jim... and while the pranks are funny and Dwight had it coming, you have to admit those complaints Dwight made are very valid, and the systematic pranks against him were far from professional. Toby also commonly allows his own emotional biases to affect his decision making in his position in the office. A lot of this has to do with Pam, and the way he handles his feelings for her is possibly my biggest problem with Toby. First of all, his crush on her is a very creepy "from afar" type of thing. He's like a young child who constantly wants attention from the girl he likes and will try to get it but is too scared to say anything. Of course, this attitude prevents him from ever saying anything to Pam and she ends up with Jim. Pam and Jim are perfect for each other and had a long history of chemistry, so things may have ended up this way anyway... but she admitted to thinking Toby was cute, so he may have ended up getting to go out with her if he made a move. It's not that he didn't make a move though... it's how this creepy and pathetic obsession from afar affects his actions AFTER Jim gets Pam. He has no one to blame but himself for not making a move, but he continues to be passive aggressive to Jim for a long, long time. He complains about their relationship (anonymously) before they go public but uses his position to make a big announcement about it, calling them out specifically. No one else even knew anything was going on, Jim and Pam were obviously not acting in extremely unprofessional manner, this was obviously just Toby being petty. This is not the only instance where Toby uses his position of HR to be petty about their relationship. He also refuses to give them a form to disclose their relationship to Dunder Mifflin, saying that it's only for "serious" relationships and insisting they should wait to see what happens. Additionally, when Ryan is being unfair and giving Jim an official "warning" about his work performance (also for ulterior motives), Toby also uses his position in HR to enforce this warning (I'm sure it actually went down on the record as well), citing how much time Jim spends with Pam. It is extremely obvious in this scene that Toby only does this because of his jealousy. On the whole, whenever Toby's feelings for Pam come up in any situation Toby seems to always handle it the wrong way. For example when he puts his hand on her leg in front of everyone. He obviously does this without thinking and the whole scene is very humorous, and I think this makes the viewer overlook how inappropriate this really is. He just grabbed her thigh because they were having a good time, even if it wasn't overtly sexual this is not a mistake that normal people just make. He never had a relationship with her that would make this action appropriate, and he basically chickens out and leaves the country afterwards. He also is willing to go to Pam's art show over his own child's school play, when the show has made clear that he doesn't get to spend much time with her because of the divorce. We also don't see him often talk about missing his daughter. He is seen obviously caring about her in "take your daughter to work day", but the biggest gesture he ever makes is the whole Christmas Present thing... and it kind of seems like he's more interested in upstaging his ex-wife. Overall, he just seems weak and petty... like someone who causes their own problems and then says "why me?" He never really does anything to better his own situation, and tends to run away whenever anything really gets in his face. I don't hate him as a character, and I don't even think he's a "bad guy". I'm just noticing that he can be kind of shitty sometimes. I'm starting to also see how his personality can be kind of annoying. Maybe Michael isn't as off base as he seems sometimes...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am absolutely fucking in love with TMV, and I trust you guys to help me find some really cool stuff to listen to from other artists. They don't have to be too similar to TMV, but there is a specific quality I'm looking for. Best way to sum it up is "weird and crazy as fuck but genius". Basically I just want a band that's really skilled but is very experimental and not afraid to get weird. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Recently, I asked for music suggestions from fellow Volta fans...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-27 07:54:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>And first of all, I want to thank those that provided advice. I've found some really cool stuff... I especially enjoy Rishloo, RX Bandits, The Sounds of Animals Fighting, and Tera Melos (also I don't remember if anyone suggested them, but I'm starting to really like Closure in Moscow). So thanks again to all those who helped me find some cool stuff! This also made me realize just how much I fucking love The Mars Volta, though. I wasn't looking for a replacement, or even something in the same "style". TMV just leaves me wanting more, and their music inspires me to seek out something new. Yet in all the years I've loved TMV, I haven't found anything that reaches me in the same way. They make me feel things that no other music can, and have unfortunately set a standard that everything else has to live up to. Even many of my oldest and most nostalgic loves don't hit me as hard as TMV can. I'm not saying that this was pointless by any means, I love finding new artists and I've found some stuff that I'm really getting into. And of course there are things I can get from some artists that I can not get from TMV. There's just something about this group that sets itself apart, though.. I almost want to say that they are my favorite band, though there is so much great music out there that is very different. It would feel wrong to say, but god damn do I love them in a way that nothing else can compare to. I'm still seeking out new stuff and enjoying other music constantly, but this TMV inspired search has not only led to some great stuff but has made me very aware of how much of an impact that Volta has had on me. Just had a huge moment of appreciation and felt like sharing. Hope everyone is doing well and is kicking it to some great music.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A review of the album Dictator, from me: some random person you don't know or care about.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-30 08:28:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>**TL;DR and overall rating at the bottom** I would like to start by stating I feel I will try my best not to compare the album to System of a Down: there are certain songs that do have a very "System" feel to them, and I of course will go over this, but these are two different projects. They share the same song-writer, and this album is tied a bit more to System than the previous one was... and I think this is important to note, but will not reflect on my views on the music itself. I feel that if you go into Scars on Broadway expecting System of a Down, you are doing yourself a great disservice. However, I do believe that a comparison to the first album is more than fair game, so let's dive in. Overall, I definitely would have to say that I prefer this album (Dictator). The more I listen to it (and I have listened to it an embarrassingly large number of times now), the more I prefer it. There are a few reasons for this. I think the first thing that jumped out to me is that this album has a much more serious and somber tone to it, while the debut had a more silly and wacky feel. I feel that while I enjoy his songs that are silly and fun, what makes me fall in love with Daron as an artist is when he gives us more than that. Because he is capable of writing music with a lot of serious emotion behind it. This is why I prefer Scars to Serj's solo work (I also find Serj to be very hit and miss with his songs, but that is not the topic for this post). While I do think that Daron's lyrics can be slightly rough at times, I think his melodies and feelings that he puts into them are far more moving than trying to be clever and topical. I can pretty much say that I have enjoyed every song Daron Malakian has written to some extent, he is very consistent in creating music that is melodic and emotionally raw. And that emotion is what shines in Dictator. Especially in songs like Guns are Loaded, Never Forget, and Till the End, I just really "feel" the songs at my core. But even in songs that I feel are at times *slightly* bland and predictable lyrically, such as Angry Guru or We Won't Obey, I honestly don't care about these issues. I just get caught up in the melody and riffs and it moves me. Like much of what Daron has done, the guitar is really amazing in this album. Six years ago when I heard that 30 second sample of Guns are Loaded, I fell in love with the guitar and it did not disappoint in full. While it's one of my least favorite songs on the album, I have grown very fond of the short solo in Angry Guru as well. However, the highlight I have to talk about? Talkin Shit. I think I had heard live versions of the song, and I enjoyed it. However, hearing the studio version the guitar work just blew me away. And while he usually keeps the solos short and sweet, most of this song was taken up by the solo. And I love that. I have to say it's truly hypnotic, and everytime I hear the song I love it more. I hope that in future Scars on Broadway albums that we get more lengthy solos as well. The album is, of course, not perfect. I truly respect that Daron wanted to do this one on his own. I feel like he needed it, too. And he did it very well, but when you compare it to the original Scars on Broadway line up, it can feel a little lacking at times- especially when it comes to drums. But you just can't beat John's ability, to be fair. Still, while he is a damned brilliant song-writer, I think I prefer him working with a full band. That said, it is incredibly impressive that he did everything himself, especially in in such a short span of ten days. He is an immensely talented individual. I also wish the album was longer, though that's hardly a real criticism. I also feel like the covers were an odd way to end the album, because they were some of the weaker songs (although Gie Mou is a beautiful track) overall. I think that they should have been distributed throughout the album. On the other hand, it does speak to my opinion of Daron Malakian as a songwriter that I prefer his original songs so much. So overall, while the first album has a few advantages to it, Dictator on the whole has better songs, riffs that are in my opinion more impressive, and a more serious feel. I kind of think that when he did the first album he didn't take the project as seriously, it was more of a placeholder in between potential System projects. Now, I get the feeling that he is more committed to Scars on Broadway, especially from the interviews I have heard with his own words. I'm very excited to see what he has to offer in the future, and what line-ups he may choose for future albums. **Rating: 8.5** **TL;DR: Despite occasionally "rough" and predictable lyrics, and the lack of the former line-ups amazing drums, Dictator is a great album that I feel has the generally better songs of the two albums. I enjoy Daron Malakian when he takes the tone of his music in a more serious direction, and I can't wait to see what he does next.** **Favorite Songs: Guns are Loaded, Never Forget, Talkin Shit, Fuck N Kill, and Till the End. We Won't Obey has also grown on me a lot, as has Sickening Wars.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In my opinion, over the course of the MCU there are three villains who have left the biggest impact on the universe:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-16 03:16:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically, I feel like these are the top three villains in terms of how much their respective "evil actions" have changed the universe that these stories take place in. Number Three: Loki Not only did Loki expose Earth to a lot of danger from outside the galaxy (not only in the Avengers but in the first Thor), he also set in forth his plan to rule that threatened the Earth so much that Nick Fury finally had to assemble the Avengers. In short, he is the first HUGE threat from another world (that we had really seen so far) and is a big part of the reason we have the Avengers in the first place. Number Two: Helmut Zemo At first glimpse, you wouldn't think Zemo would be make the cut in terms of importance. He is just a regular soldier who lost what he cares about and obviously blames the Avengers. He doesn't have any powers, he isn't trying to rule/destroy the world, and he certainly isn't a "universal threat" on the surface. What makes him so important is that his plan is to end the Avengers... and he succeeds. He gets the right resources, information, and timing and creates a serious divide in the team. After he is finished with his actions, the Avengers are divided and reduced, and no longer the "Avengers" at all really. Of course this is huge for the story on Earth... but the division of the Avengers ultimately allows certain other "forces" to truly DECIMATE the flow of life throughout the entire universe, and it could possibly have been prevented if the Avengers were united to stop it. By forces, I obviously mean... Number One: Thanos This one is obvious. His shadow has been cast over the entire MCU since the first Avengers. He has drastically impacted many characters, which is especially seen in the Guardians films. He is the strongest, both physically and in his sheer will. And he is by far the most ambitious, and he gave the Avengers the toughest and most brutal battle they had ever met. His will had affected so much of the universe before he is even introduced: he has wiped out vast numbers on multiple different planets, gained insane intergalactic standing and importance, and has attained devout followers dedicated to seeing his will done. And, like Zemo, his plan is ultimately a success and in Infinity War he gets exactly what he wants. Unfortunately, unlike Zemo, his ambition is not to merely undo the Avengers. Through his own ability, planning, and self sacrifice, he manages to wipe out half of all life in the universe. Even if the Avengers come together and undo this, the pain and impact he has left upon the MCU will always be felt and is more than enough to earn him the title of the most important villain of the MCU. What do you guys think, am I right in who the 3 most important villains are?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A lovely drive-through interaction</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-19 01:25:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm new to this sub but I love getting pissed off on everyone's behalf reading these stories! This is my first post here, and this incident was several months ago. It's not the craziest story I've seen here, but I feel like it's appropriate. So at the time I was living in an apartment in the city, and there was a nearby location for a fast-food chain that I typically really enjoy. My roomate and I picked up some food from their drive through a couple times, and the service typically wasn't great. Nothing major, mostly that specific type of "I don't want to be here and don't care about you" attitude that you occasionally see in fast food. And once or twice they would get the order a little wrong. This never really bothered me... I've worked in the service industry for a long time and fast food jobs can really suck on top of that, so I try to make sure I'm polite and understanding in these situations. Plus I honestly really like the food of this particular chain, so it was worth it to come back. However, one night my roommate and I go to pick up some dinner and the line for the drive through is a little long. When we get up to the speaker to order, the guy on the other end is being particularly short and rude. He definitely was trying to rush us, and that alone isn't a big deal. I get it, there's a long line of people. But when my friend orders his meal, the guy taking our order asks "homestlye, spicy or grilled" in regards to the chicken (this is a paraphrase, not specific terminology used by a business)... but I honestly still to this day think this guy was drunk. He was mumbling and VERY hard to understand. We had been struggling to make out what he was saying the whole time, but for some reason this question just jumbled together really badly when he asked, and his words were slurred and incoherent coming from the little speaker. I asked him politely if he could repeat the question, and he did (somewhat angrily)- but we STILL couldn't understand. One more time, I asked "I'm so sorry, I still didn't catch that". He says "hold on". Next thing we know, this huge guy is walking out from the back door by the dumpster and walking to our car. He starts screaming and cussing about how he isn't "playing games" tonight, and he accuses us of messing with him since we had understood everything he said but that one question. He asked it again, this time it was easier to understand since he was literally screaming it into my window. He was crazy rude and and aggressive, and we were honestly just so taken off guard that we just apologized and answered the question we now heard for the fist time. It wasn't until he went back inside that I started to get angry about it. There's no reason EVER to come outside and start screaming at your customers, I don't care how unhappy you are at your job. Plus he really was slurring his words a lot, I feel like he really may have been drunk. I had heard bad things about the service at this restaurant, but I had figured it was just little stuff like what I had experienced before this. I never went back again (which is a shame because it was the only location somewhat close to me) and the next day I did call to let the manager know what had happened. I was able to give her the time of the incident and I think she knew who I was talking about. I told her it had cost my business there, and figured that they should know that they have an employee that would treat the customers that way. I'm not sure how much she cared just by hearing her on the phone, but I'm still glad I said something because in my opinion that's unacceptable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Approaching the last season, I'm starting to fully appreciate how impressive the show actually is.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-20 01:53:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>There is, of course, a large portion of fans out there who believe the show has declined a lot in terms of quality over the years. In a lot of ways I do agree with this- the writing isn't as clever or subtle as it was in the first couple seasons, some sub plots feel either forced or out of place, and the grounded focus on relationships and political intrigue has decreased to make room for the flashier elements of fantasy. This doesn't bother me, though; in fact I still think that Game of Thrones is one of the biggest, best, and most ambitious shows out there. These books were originally considered to be damn near impossible to film, by professionals and by the author himself. There were too many characters and set-pieces, the story was too massive and the battles just get bigger and bigger. However David and Dan did it, and we got impressively faithful adaptations of the first couple of books (with some exceptions of course) that managed to keep a lot of that subtle mystery and intrigue from the early parts of the story. Even when I first started reading the books and hadn't gotten to the later story arcs, one characteristic that I fell in love with was how the overall story pulls a "reverse Lord of the Rings" in regards to magic. Instead of a magical world fading into a new one, we have a world that has already had its magic fade but is starting to return again many years later. As a result, we have a series that starts off focusing on characters, politics and drama but with the fantasy elements becoming more and more prevalent as the story goes on. I loved the things that make the story unique in the fantasy genre, but I was still very excited to see the mystical side of things to really start affecting the established characters and stories. In a way I'm fortunate that this aspect of ASOIAF appealed to me. I can easily see how someone who was mostly invested in the more grounded stories in the first couple books may be turned off a bit by the show where it is now. It has shifted from a political drama to an all out fantasy epic, and the writing has gotten much more simple on top of that. However, that was always the story we were being told, we just didn't have the *whole* story yet. Even in the books, you can see that the unexplained and "magic" plot points are becoming more important as the series grows longer. The show is just getting there faster, and that's something that they have to do. They know the basic endgame of the series, and they understand what I think is most important: they captured the aspects of the early story that they needed to in order to make the characters and their growth the focus, and threw those characters into the heat of the magic and chaos for the stories climax. For the sake of pacing and keeping the show fresh, they had to make sure that the show didn't run too long, and as a result they had to simplify the story in a timely fashion. Even with the most skilled writers in existence, to do this with a story this big is going to mean that you can't keep writing things in a way that is consistently growing in its complexity. While David and Dan have certainly done one or two things differently than I might have, I still think that they have given us a perfect adaptation for a book series like this. It's surprisingly faithful to the books that are out, and it's reaching a pretty satisfying conclusion (at least for people like me who were always waiting for the fantasy climaxes) without having a source to adapt for it. Thinking of all the hundreds of plots and threads that weave through this series (not to mention the insane amount of fully realized characters), it's honestly amazing to me how few of them disappointed me at all. I think some of the "issues" in the later seasons wouldn't be as easy to spot if the first three seasons or so weren't so damn near flawless. Every show has flaws, and Game of Thrones has less than most- at least in my opinion. Plus the highlights soar so high. We have an awesome visual version of ASOIAF, and I think that as long as we get a satisfying end in season 8 that we should be very proud of what we have been given. So basically this is an unapologetic circlejerk appreciation post for how great David and Dan have done with Game of Thrones. Sure, I've wondered what the hell they were thinking at points in the past few years, but overall they've done a great job bringing this journey to the world of television and as a result of given us one of the biggest, most impacting, and arguably best series of all time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My interpretation of the theme of this series.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-04 08:57:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I grew up reading A Series of Unfortunate Events, and I fondly remember the excitement I felt as each of the last few books was released. I was young then, so the details from the books has faded a bit, but the enjoyment I got from them is still lodged in my memory. Even thinking about the audio books narrated by Tim Curry gives me a ton of nostalgia. Having felt that the movie was not a satisfactory adaptation, I was cautiously optimistic when the Netflix series was announced. At the very least, I would finally get an adaptation of all my favorite books that had come later in the series, and having read the series so long ago I was hoping to relive the journey that was somewhat hazy to me at the time. And despite tiny nitpicks the series was great and exactly what I had hoped for... and at long last I have seen the end of the series on film and it was amazing. Not just because of how much I enjoyed the ending (which I did), but also because it made me realize so much about what makes this series so amazing. Enough to have convinced me that this was the best children's series I have ever witnessed. There are many reasons I feel this way: not only is it a finely crafted narrative with compelling characters and intrigue, but it also expertly adds elements you would not expect to find in a children's book. The most notable of these elements, to me, are the use of absurd-ism and satire in the story. This is what writing a story for young readers is for: not just to provide an entertaining story for them, but to introduce them to the wider world of literature and themes. Which leads me to what I interpret the central theme of A Series of Unfortunate Events to be... the darkness of growing up. Reading the series as a child I was unable to pick up on this, but having finished the series on Netflix as an adult it is absolutely what I took away from this story. Childhood is often looked upon fondly as a time of purity, innocence, and fun. In turn, as most adults would agree, growing up very much involves losing this innocence and fun as you are exposed to the more serious elements of life. In the series, this is represented by Mr. Poe telling the Baudelaire children that their parents have unexpectedly died in a fire. Most of the adults in the series have a certain ignorance and quirky personality that comes across as borderline absurdist writing, and I believe this is illustrating that all of these "grown ups" have lost that naivety and purity that the Baudelaires carry throughout the story. Even the more the quicker pace of their dialogue represents that they are now "in a hurry" and don't have time to think the same way that they used to. Most of them are so wrapped up in their own interests and motives that they either actively take advantage of the children or are too self involved to help them in any way. Even the adults who do help the Baudelaires and seem to share their moral values have that same quirky personality, and as the series goes on we realize that these adults have a much more complicated sense of morality and a wide history of actions that are not always entirely "good" or "bad". I view the story as a metaphor, where Violet, Klaus, and Sony having to navigate a suddenly confusing and dark world is a mirror for a young person losing the shelter of their childhood as they discover that the world is actually full of danger, strange people and sometimes "unhappy endings". Throughout the series the Baudelaires mention how their parents "did not prepare them" for how complicated their world really was. There are other little things I have noticed in the stories as well, such as how the world seeming so small may represent that as an adult the world isn't as vast and endless as we once thought (hence the phrase "small world"). There are also several encounters with adults in this world that remind me of encounters in the book "The Little Prince", which has very similar themes as those who are familiar with it know. The end of the story is really where all of this is summed up. The island to me represents that purity of youth itself. It's far removed from the dark problems of the world, the residents are "sheltered" from that craziness, and it represents where the entire story begins in many ways. The Baudelaire parents initially wanted to raise the children there, separate from the harsh world. They went back to the mainland because the inevitably realized that children cannot be sheltered forever. It seems fitting for the end of a story about "growing up" for the children to return to that island, and finally make the choice to leave it (their childhood) themselves. When they do go there, they learn many secrets they have been "sheltered" from this whole time, they realize that the "evil man" chasing them the entire time was just as complicated and layered as the ones who were helping the children. And finally they help bring new life into the world, and having to realize the same thing about that child that their parents had realized about them: no one can be protected forever. These lessons and their decision to leave the island is them finally growing up, and the "adventures" the TV series hints at during the ending is basically the Baudelaires leading their adult lives. For some reason the way all of this was portrayed was very beautiful for me, and the story overall serves as a great satire on adulthood on par with "The Little Prince" (and seriously, to the few out there who may not be familiar it is an amazing and brilliant children's book that is very short). This is also just my takeaway, of course, and I am not the one who wrote these stories. My interpretation may not be the correct one, but it works and it's how I felt. For a story to leave me thinking about its themes in this way is something to be applauded. This is a great way for young people of the world to be introduced to the ideas of adventure, literature, and what this journey in life is like. And for a collection of stories about becoming adults to be called "A Series of Unfortunate Events" is both hilarious and satirically brilliant. **TL;DR I believe that the story of the Baudelaire children is a metaphor for growing up from childhood into adulthood, that it is a brilliant children's satire and that the "series of unfortunate events" is the trials and tribulations of getting older and leaving your youth behind.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Physical description of characters</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-21 02:13:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'd like to hear some different views on the importance of describing what your characters look like physically: how soon or early in the story does it need to be done or does anyone actually feel that describing what your characters look like isn't even 100% necessary? As a writer I want to paint a picture in my readers' mind, and while descriptive writing is great and truly helpful I do think that an important part of reading is the "working out" of your imagination, does anybody feel that TOO much description can potentially get in the way of this? Plus going into unnecessary detail can sometimes get a little tedious for the reader. I'm interested in this subs' take on these points, and really just some general input on this entire subject. Sometimes I find that it's a little awkward to force in the physical descriptions that I want for my characters, and I want to understand the way others see this matter and a little advice certainly wouldn't hurt. Thank you so much for your time, and certainly for any input.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Christopher Lee plays a main villain in arguably the biggest sci-fi movie and again in arguably the biggest fantasy movie- both roles have shockingly similar beats</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-23 05:40:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>In Star Wars he plays Count Dooku, a man the Yoda and the other Jedi know as an old ally and member of the Jedi order. When a new war begins, the Jedi discover that he has abandoned his Jedi ways to join the Sith. Darth Sideous had been able to persuade him to abandon his old ways in order to join and serve him. He is killed before the war is over. In Lord of the Rings he plays Saruman, a man Gandalf and the wizards know as an old ally and a wizard titled "The White". When a new war begins, Gandalf discovers that he has abandoned his loyalty to Middle Earth and the other wizards to join the forces of Mordor and that Sauran himself has corrupted and converted him to the darker side. He is killed before the end of the war (not in the book, but in the extended movie). Maybe obvious and not as crazy to you guys, but the fact that both are possibly the most famous movies of the sci-fi and fantasy genres respectively AND that the roles go so similarly was a bit crazy to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Watching Andy in most of season 8 (during my millionth rewatch) REALLY bums me out knowing how his character ends up.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-22 01:28:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Especially in the first episodes of Andy being manager, it's really amazing how much his character grew and developed. In my opinion, he's a better manager for the office than Michael ever was... at least in terms of competency. How much he's grown from his anger issues and the development of his relationship with Erin are also both huge displays of how much he matures over the course of the show. I really love the development, and it is honestly as compelling to me as the development of other characters like Dwight and even Michael. However, unlike with those characters, the show completely backslides on all that development by the end of the show, and that really makes it stand out from the character other arcs in a negative way- it feels both unnatural and unrealistic to me. I really wish they didn't do that, because like I said I think his development was a real achievement for the show. To start off as an incredibly annoying kiss-ass with severe anger management issues and grow him into a kind and well-meaning boss with a meaningful relationship is a hard thing to pull off, but the show did it. Then he just turns into a pathetic and shallow caricature of his original impression, and not only does it not make sense it just undoes a lot of what made his character compelling for me. The Office is my favorite sit-com because of its incredibly high caliber writing, and despite what other people may say I truly think it stays at that quality even after Michael leaves. I love seasons eight and nine, they both have some of my favorite scenes, and I think the show's ending is incredibly well written. Andy's character arc in the last season or so of the show is the only time I think the writing is ever bad, but that just makes it stand out more to me in an otherwise perfect show. What do you guys think? I know I've seen a ton of people on this sub that don't like how his character ended up, but do you think it's as bad as I do? Or am I just overreacting? I'd love to hear other people's thoughts here.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-02-28 05:10:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've always had a thing for horror films, but recently I've really been wanting to dive even deeper. I work at a used record/movie/book store, and I've been able to "rent" movies for free. This has lately made my interest in horror more of an obsession, and I'm looking for some titles that I haven't seen that might be worth watching. I even enjoy shitty horror movies at times, so I'm really open to anything that you think is worth watching. I want stuff I haven't seen, so obscure stuff is obviously welcome. If you have the time and feel like it, though, I'm including a list of the main stuff I can remember seeing. Obviously I won't remember everything, but I'm going to give it a real shot. **LOVED:** A Dark Song The Devil's Candy Ravenous (1999) Cabin in the Woods Black Swan Donnie Darko A Quiet Place Get Out Gerald's Game 28 Days Later The Invitation  #8203; **LIKED:** The Exorcism of Emily Rose Hereditary IT (new one) Split The Conjuring The VVitch It Follows Saw The Sixth Sense The Shining Nightmare on Elm Street Psycho (original) Poltergeist Raw The Jacket We Are Still Here Under the Skin Ringu (original) Ju-On (original) Session 9 Jacob's Ladder Creep Annihilation Secret Window Hush Veronica John Dies at the End  #8203; **LIKED DESPITE OBVIOUS ISSUES (INCLUDING CAMPINESS)** The Evil Dead trilogy Pet Semetary (original, obviously) The Babadook Creepshow Friend Request VHS (1+2) Antichrist Saw (2+3) Stir of Echoes Carrie (original and remake) Before I wake Communion The Fly The Conjuring It Comes At Night Shrooms Tusk Mother The Last Exorcism The Boy The Others Thelma Oculus  #8203; **AVERAGE:** Dawn of the Dead Rose Red Exorcist Sequels Blair Witch (new movie) The Omen (old and remake) Halloween The Butterfly Effect Mama Dreamcatcher The Ring (1+2) Boogeyman Gothika The Amityville Horror Ouija: Origin of Evil Final Destination 30 Days of Night Sinister Splice Shutter Island Mirrors Paranormal Activity The Rite Bird Box The Lazarus Effect The Ritual Insidious  #8203; **DISLIKED** The Hills Have Eyes Hostel Drag Me To Hell Jeepers Creepers Saw (every movie after 3) Blair Witch (original and sequel) The Grudge Halloween (Rob Zombie film) House of 1000 Corpses (just can't get into Rob Zombie for whatever reason) Riding the Bullet The Number 23 Don't Breathe (really couldn't understand the hype) The Woman in Black Texas Chainsaw Massacre Cabin Fever The Human Centipede The Wicker Man House of Wax Cloverfield  #8203; So obviously, there's probably a ton I don't remember. But if you did look the list over, you at least have an idea of what I've seen and like. Any movie suggestions at all are welcome, thank you!  #8203;</TEXT>

I liked them, and I still remember how awesome Knights of Cydonia was live even though that was almost twelve years ago. But I didn't appreciate Muse as much back then, I was there for MCR (sadly I'm not really into them these days). Fast forward to recent years, and I've become obsessed. Like they might be in my top five favorite bands. I've really wanted to see them live, and now is such a great time. Simulation Theory is actually my second favorite album by them, and this tour looks insane!!! I'm just so excited that I got tickets! I can't wait!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Interesting and talented nu-metal suggestions?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-11 07:31:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm interested in the genre, and I enjoy some of what I've listened to, and I actually really like a lot of Korn's stuff in particular... but a lot of the stuff I've seen is really not for me (Limp Bizkit being a big example of this). Still, I do have that interest in nu-metal, and the blending of rap and metal in particular is something I feel like I could really enjoy when done well (Rage Against the Machine is a favorite of mine). So I would love some recommendations for really good nu-metal artists. Weirdness and creativity is definitely appreciated. Also, I know that Slipknot's name seems to get tossed around in regards to this genre, but stuff like that is not really what I'm looking for here. I know there's not a ton to go on here, but I really would appreciate any genuine recommendations.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What scenes from the show blew you away?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-17 03:42:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>To be clear, the question is not "which scenes from GOT did you like/love"... the question is which scenes from the show *absolutely blew you away.* Honestly, it can take quite a lot to truly blow someone away in a show, and more than likely some people haven't even felt that strongly about **any** scene. There are quite a few for myself, though, and I can think of at least one from each season- but everyone is unique and responds to different things. I'm sure many people weren't too big on some of the scenes that completely wowed me, and likewise I'm sure I didn't get that reaction from scenes that had that affect on many others. To those of us who were hugely impacted by this show, I'm curious to see what it was that left you in complete awe... whether it was a result of a plot twist, a performance, cinematography, moments of action or some combination of the above. Particularly during your first watch of the show, what were the moments that really made you the fan you are and put the show on the level it is (or was, depending on how you may feel about the show now). Here's my list of "next level moments", in order of occurrence: **Season One:** * The Golden Crown * Ned's death * Birth of the dragons **Season Two:** * The first real look at the army of the dead **Season Three:** * Dany sacks Astapor and takes the Unsullied for herself. * The Red Wedding **Season Four:** * Arya kills Polliver and gets Needle back * Joffrey's wedding and death * Tyrion's trial and big speech * The fight between Oberyn and The Mountain **Season Five:** * Hardhome **Season Six:** * Jon and Sansa are reunited * "Hold the door" * Jon holding his ground alone against the Bolton army, the collision of both forces and the continuous shot afterward * Cersei blows up the sept * Arya kills Walder Frey * Bran discovers what happened in the Tower of Joy * Jon is named King in the North **Season Seven:** * Arya wipes out almost all of House Frey * The entire "Field of Fire" battle * The scene between Jon and Theon, including Theon's resulting fight to lead the Ironborn on a mission to rescue Yara</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In episode 36 of the 2011 anime, after Hisoka beats Gon in Heaven's Arena, I noticed something kind of cool. When Hisoka walks off, Gon thinks to himself that while he needs more training in Nen, Hisoka isn't out of reach... we hear him in his head saying "I just need to find a power as strong as Hisoka's" and **immediately** after this line, the shot changes to his hand clenching into a fist. Of course this is a natural physical action to take when expressing this sentiment, but seeing it really gave me the vibe that it was a light foreshadow for his Jajanken. I know it's really small, but in the moment I loved it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How much time will Endgame spend on the events after the final climax/battle?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-27 23:42:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>**There is a tl;dr/main point below the bullets.** Obviously Endgame has an epic-sized amount of stuff to accomplish- not the least of which being how the heroes will deal with Thanos, the infinity stones, avenging the ones they've lost and pretty much fixing existence. But Endgame is also meant to be the big final act of the original Avengers and their interwoven stories. The movie not only has to settle this big final conflict, but it has to serve as an ending for a few characters AND as a set up for a ton of others. Examples being: * **Captain America:** Does he die? If so, why does it happen and how does it impact the others going forward? If not, what is a satisfying conclusion to the story of a man who was taken away from his life and now lives in a strange future where his only purpose in life is to fight/save others? * **Iron Man:** Does **he** die? If so, why does it happen and how does it impact the others going forward? If not, does he have a kid? Does he settle down and have a family, or does he continue to be an Avenger? Or, does he settle down for the most part, only suiting up in the most dire of circumstances? What will be the endpoint for his character growth that we've seen for so many movies? * **Thor:** Is he satisfied with how things resolve in Endgame? Since the Asgardians were actually taken down to half by Thanos' actual force and not the snap, are they brought back at all through time travel? Does he find a new home for his people? Does he stick with Asgard and fulfill his role as King or will he have unfinished business somewhere in the universe? * **Banner/Hulk:** How will the relationship develop? This can go so many different ways, including the "Professor Hulk" scenario, but either way we will need some conclusive understanding of how this was resolved at the end of this film. And whichever way it goes, will it mean he stays on the team as an Avenger, or will he take his journey elsewhere? Does anything happen with Nat or has that storyline been ditched? * **Black Widow:** She may not have as clear-cut of an overall arc as some other Avengers, and I feel like we'll definitely be seeing her again in a few movies to come, but there still needs to be a good resting place for her character in this film. How does the end of this film affect her? I have a feeling she'll continue to be an Avenger, but is there a chance she ends up doing more stuff with SHIELD? They seemed to briefly acknowledge her romance with Bruce in Infinity War, so that may at least need to be addressed one last time (though there's a good chance they just ditched that arc because of audience feedback). * **Hawkeye:** Seeing as they were probably snapped away, does he get his family back, and if so what is their life going to be like? I'm less confident about him returning for future films than Black Widow, but I think he's also more likely to be back than someone like say Captain America. Either way, it seems like he's been trying to retire for a bit. Once the Thanos situation is resolved, will he finally retire for good? There's a lot of potential closure we could for his story. * **"New Avengers":** And of course, there are so many characters going forward that could really use a conclusion in this film so that we see what direction they'll be going in. Will **Black Panther** aid the Avengers moving forward, or will he mostly stay in Wakanda? Likewise, what will the role of **Doctor Strange** be? I assume he will remain Sorcerer Supreme, but will he become an Avenger also? Similarly, **Spider-Man** might need the most of a "transitional conclusion"; he was named an Avenger in Infinity War, will that stick? He seems to still have a "friendly neighborhood" thing going on in the Far from Home trailers, but will he be an honorary Avenger at least? If Stark is alive, what will their relationship look like going forward, and if not, how will it impact him? It's been hinted at that he will be a big part of the MCU post Endgame, and that it is appropriate for his next film to be the first in Phase Four, so I feel like his stuff will need to be wrapped up a bit. On top of that we have **Captain Marvel**, who was just introduced. Will she be easier to contact now, or will she just stay on Earth a bit? Does Endgame change her character arc up, or when we see her again after will it just be more of a continuation from her Origin film? Not to mention that there are TONS of other characters with story arcs: **Ant-Man** and his family, **Vision** and **Scarlet Witch** and their relationship, all of the **Guardians** and how their group will go on (and if any of them still don't make it), and STILL more characters in need of closure.  #8203; **MY MAIN POINT:** So after Thanos and the Infinity Stone story is resolved, and everything is (presumably) somewhat returned to normal, there is still a lot of closure needed for a lot of characters; how much of the movie do you think will be devoted to wrapping things up? Honestly, I'm hoping for something like "Return of the King", maybe somewhere in between the standard and extended cuts. I would be totally okay with spending 30 or so minutes AFTER the main action just to see where everyone's at and how things will be going forward. Any thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What major tie ins from season one do you expect in the final season?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-30 06:22:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's pretty common to have a lot of parallels, references, call backs, and tie ins to the beginning of the story once you reach the end, "coming full circle" and all of that. And of course, Maisie specifically mentioned that "so much" of season eight "refers back to" the first season. I'm starting me re-watch of the show leading up to the end, and I'm paying close attention to the first season (as I'm sure many others are) to try and speculate what bits are important for the endgame. I think even GRRM mentioned once that something from very early on in the first book was a huge foreshadowing or reference to the end of the series. So what are potential bits from the beginning that may tie in to the end? I'm interested in your theories and observations. I have a few myself, ranging from obvious ones to possible details. Original symbols of the White Walkers * Potential secrets of Winterfell and maybe the crypts * The birth of the dragons- potentially Illyrio's intentions in gifting the eggs * The direwolves being found for the Stark Children * The Stark's being together * Jaime potentially facing Bran for the first time after pushing him * Tyrion's saddle design for Bran stood out to me. I may be wrong, but I don't think we've seen this yet. With everything going on, and the potential need to evacuate Winterfell, maybe we'll finally see him use this. Not huge, but could definitely be made to be a call back. Plus there's the theory that Tyrion will use this to design saddles for dragons (could help Jon with riding). Clearly, other than the big obvious stuff, I don't have a lot. Anyone got more ideas?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-14 00:47:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>As far as the show goes, it might be the first time. I started watching right as season two was wrapping up, and I binged both seasons. I didn't see Ned's death coming, and I thought it was an extremely well done and emotional moment... but it didn't SHOCK me to my core like it seemed to for so many others. It may have been that I didn't see promotional material, but he didn't feel as crucial to the series as some people did (even though I did love his character, and I was by no means expecting it to happen then). I also didn't really look into what people thought about the show until finishing the first two seasons, when I decided to read the books. That was when I first really heard about the series' reputation for killing off main characters in shocking ways. So after I read the first two books and got ahead of the show, I went into ASOS TRULY thinking anyone could be killed. The Red Wedding really shocked me, too- but even after that I still felt like some characters had plot armor- Jon and Dany being big examples. But since I read the books, going forward after season two I knew what was coming, and I still felt like characters had plot armor. Seasons three and four I knew every big death coming (pretty much), and starting in season five after the show passed the books, I just felt the plot armor for the big characters all the more. Even when Jon "died", I NEVER doubted he would be back. But now with the last season coming, it dawned on me that it finally truly feels like anyone can be killed. I've always been of the opinion that major deaths in the final season won't have the same impact as major deaths earlier in the show, seeing as the show will soon be over anyway... but I have to admit it is cool to at long last feel like anyone truly may be next on the chopping block on the show. **p.s. flaired as fuck olly because fuck olly**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To specify more of what I'm looking for, I enjoy horror movies (preferably supernatural in their plot) that are heavy on disturbing imagery and don't rely on gore. Jump scares are okay, but the bizarre horror imagery is more of what I want. They don't have to be the best horror movie ever by any means, as long as they aren't bad movies. I tend to enjoy B movies in the horror genre, as long as they are decent and are creepy. Also, loving the horror genre I've seen quite a few of the ones people like to recommend- such as Hereditary, The Witch, The Ritual, and so on. I'd say my top 3 horror movies (right now) are probably A Dark Song, Gerald's Game, and Cabin in the Woods, but in this moment I want recommendations for movies with less of a slow burn. The movies in the title of this post are great examples. Just simple, decent, creepy movies with lots of disturbing visuals. Thanks in advance for any recommendations!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-28 05:01:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Potentially better than the final three, but I guess we'll see. I'm seriously getting "Breaking Bad: Ozymandias" vibes here. Not only is it the end of the first half of a shortened final season, but it is a HUGE battle that has been built up more than any battle in the past and any sequence left in the show, and it is the first battle against the army of the dead with real stakes beyond losing a couple characters. They have crossed the wall, they have reached Winterfell, this is it: this episode will dictate how the final three episodes go, and will be a hugely epic battle on top of that. Not only have we not had a battle of this scale before, but we've never had a battle with this many main characters, and this is after over seven seasons of character building. I know none of this is new information, but fuck I'm getting so hype. I mean, directly involved in the battle we got: 1. Jon 2. Dany 3. Tyrion 4. Jaime 5. Arya 6. Bran 7. Sansa 8. Theon 9. Brienne 10. Pod 11. Samwell 12. Edd 13. Davos 14. Tormund 15. The Hound 16. Beric 17. Jorah 18. Gendry 19. Grey Worm 20. Lyanna Not to mention we have more characters like Varys who will potentially have some importance, dragons, GHOST, and the mother fucking army of the dead led by the Night King on and un-dead Viserion. THIS SHIT IS GON BE LIT!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loved the episode, but like clockwork come to reddit and people are complaining so hard. I guess that's their right, no one has to like anything, but it's just getting so old. To be fair, most of what I saw was r/asoiaf which honestly can be a bunch of neckbeard, book purist, butt-hurt fanboys some times. I love where this went. I loved Arya getting the kill, I NEVER expected it but I would take it over Jon or Dany ANY FUCKING DAY OF THE WEEK. And I'm also really glad the AOTD ends here. The root of this story has always been the character conflicts, it makes so much more sense to be the final conflict. The ONLY thing I'm worried about is that I want this war against the AOTD to still have a ton of significance in the next three episodes, like I want the ending we get to not have been possible at all without it... or half of the entire show will seem pointless. I feel confident that it will end up having been very important, though. To the people who say Cersei and her forces should be super easy after the undead... I strongly disagree. The Night King and his army have basically just been an evil force, overwhelming and terrifying yes, but the Night King doesn't have the mind Cersei has. Cersei has proven time and time over to be more cruel and cunning than the Night King, especially after this episode. Plus, her plan has succeeded- the undead have taken a MASSIVE portion of her enemies' armies out of the way. On top of generally liking the direction, there were some fucking awesome scenes. Theon's death is one of my favorite scenes in the show. I'd love to hear from others who feel the same way. I know 100% well that all that matters is whether I like it, not what everyone else thinks, but I used to love coming to reddit to discuss things and now it just feels like every time I come here people are just mercilessly hating on all the things I want to talk about. I guess I'm just as much of a butt-hurt fanboy here... maybe I should just give up on using reddit to discuss shows I love once they pass five seasons.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What adventure anime should I watch next?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-03 04:00:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ask here because HxH is 500% my all time favorite anime, and I trust the people who love it to give me a good recommendation. While most of my other favorites are pretty different from HxH, I'm looking for something with some similar traits/vibe. It doesn't necessarily have to be a shounen, but that same sense of adventure is something I want. But I want something with strategy involved, where it pays to think things through. Preferably with multiple characters with intelligence and wit. I also want it to have some real investment and emotion when it comes to characters. I want to feel stuff. Apart from that, I'm a sucker for anime that (like HxH) get a good bit darker in the later episodes when things get more intense. So again, big things I'm looking for: * Adventure * Strategy and Outwitting each other is a plus * Compelling characters * Emotion * Decent story obviously * Darker and intense moments are also a plus * Ending is a huge bonus, especially if it's over 50 episodes. **I've seen a few things I feel may get suggested:** **Wasn't crazy about: Attack on Titan.** **Was pretty good: My Hero Academia (haven't watched newest season)** **Really enjoyed: Gintama.** **I've seen other popular recommendations like One Punch Man and Death Note, but like I said I'm looking for something with more of an adventure feel, so I'm thinking like 50 episodes or maybe more.** **Thank you guys!**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Walking Dead appreciation:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-14 02:59:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>The idea that The Walking Dead is terrible now (or has been for years up until season nine) is not rare, especially on reddit and other internet forums. I would never claim that the opinion of others is "wrong", especially one shared between so many people- there's obviously something credible to make so many feel that way. I have to say, though, I just don't see it. I don't find it hard to understand that people would call out problems with the writing and some of the choices made by the showrunners... there is definitely plenty of flaws there to warrant it. I also totally get why many people just don't like it- certain flaws ruin the enjoyment for certain people more than others, and apart from that the show has changed drastically in many ways... it makes total sense that people would be turned off by so much change or by flaws that hinder their enjoyment. I just sincerely can't understand why *so many people* truly **hate** the show to the level that I've seen- or rather I can't personally see why it seems to have become "common knowledge" that the show is just objectively bad overall. I know that the reason I can't wrap my head around it is simply because I feel so differently about the show, and I 100% acknowledge that I'm not some hyper-intelligent expert in television and that it's possible my personal bar for quality for this particular type of show might just be lower than others. It may just be that, and I say this honestly with no sarcasm at all, some viewers just might be smarter than I am, at least in terms of being able to see what makes good writing and television. That said, I'm an amateur writer myself and have enjoyed both creating and consuming stories for decades- literally as long as I can remember. No matter how perceptive I am to "objective quality", I take this stuff seriously. When I get sucked into a work of fiction, I go all in. That includes nit-picking and judging the story on my own standards. The point here being: yes, some seasons have had flaws in pacing, some with writing (be it for the integrity of the story or just logic). Some seasons have leaned a bit too heavily on tricks and "shocking gimmicks", or have just had more general problems with structure or directorial choices. In fact, a good few of the seasons have at least had some instances of all of these issues at some point. But overall, I think the story has had a lot more good going for it than bad, no matter which season you focus on. Throughout the entire run, the show has been consistent in providing: * Complex themes of morality * A ton of interesting and compelling characters * A dangerous world that is both totally different yet in many ways a dark mirror of our own * Attention to the basic necessities of surviving in a zombie outbreak, both obvious and less so. By showing so much time passing from the outbreak to the reforming of many civilizations, it has become the quintessential zombie piece for me just in the sense that you get a real feel for the "full experience" of this disaster, both short term and long term. * A real intensity throughout all of the show's conflicts. There is very little in the way of plot armor, and the from early on TWD has shown that it is willing to do very dark things to the characters. It's easy to randomly kill characters off for shock value, but what is impressive to me is how well the show uses these stakes to create real tension when there is conflict. Sure, there are moments where you can assume that the characters will most likely work everything out, but the entire show is filled with real danger for its characters, and for the most part it really makes you fear for their well-being. Especially in the later half of the show, there is a shockingly low amount of characters that you don't have to worry about dying, because you know the showrunners can't/won't kill them off. Even the rare occasion where you just KNOW an actor isn't going to be booted off, that could easily be subject to change later on in the show's run. * A story of survivors that, while not always the most clever plot around, does invest you into knowing what happens to the characters you are following. * Last but definitely not least, amazing performances by some great actors in the show. All of these points have been consistent in my opinion, from season one all the way through season nine. I know I'm fanboying a bit, but I really think the show has been very impressive overall. The majority can call the show garbage, they have every right to call it like they see it. I love the show as a whole, though, and after nine years of consistently being a story that I enjoy like this I think The Walking Dead has MORE than earned my appreciation.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-17 01:13:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>They've always cracked me up so much, both in their work and just in their personalities... to the point where for a long time I've already had them as my personal pick for "funniest person/people alive". But as I've been playing "Fractured But Whole" for the first time (way late to the party, I know), I've really just been thinking about how fucking great these guys really are. They've done 22 seasons of South Park, which is a huge feat in itself... and while it may not be as ground-breaking or novel as it used to be I still think it's fucking hysterical, and when you look at the decline of other shows as they've been on the air for so long I feel like South Park has done VERY well at maintaining its quality... especially considering that this isn't just a "long run of television", this is over two decades. The only other comparable show to do this, The Simpsons, has been widely considered to be pretty bad for a very long time now. But, it's not just their humorous personalities and accomplishments on the show. They've made several films, including a very well received movie for South Park itself. Baseketball may be very stupid, but I also think its underrated in just how funny it may be- even if it's not their most clever work. And fucking Team America... Team America: World Police is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and has since become something of a cult hit. AND they are behind the release for two games based on South Park- Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole. Most creators would just make a bunch of money off of other people making games for their franchise, but these guys are real game lovers and decided to have a huge part in the creation of these games, and this was the right call. The games are funny as hell, and it they feel like you get to play out an episode of South Park and explore the town. There are hilarious lines and gags as the story unfolds, but even the game mechanics can be effective jokes WHILE REMAINING FUN. That's the other thing with these games, they are actually really fun. Like "award winning RPG" fun, it's crazy how talented these guys are. Oh, and to top it all fucking off, they created a Broadway musical too. The fact that they just up and did that is badass enough, let alone that it broke financial records, received butt loads of praise, and won nine fucking tony's including best musical.

    <TITLE>Here's the main thing that I think ruined GOT.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-20 00:29:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know, I'm breaking new ground here- NO ONE is talking about what's wrong with Game of Thrones or the writing these days. (obviously /s) And there are all kinds of things that we all know to be true- D amp;D are arrogant, last seasons are rushed to move on to new projects, ect. But in general, I was prepared for it to be a little rushed, and I could handle the problems with logic (everything with Euron) or just genral sloppiness (coffee cups left in scenes). However, because they rushed the show, I think D amp;D made one specific decision that single handed-ly took the show from "flawed but still acceptable" to the show that has a million people signing a petition to remake the last season. For the record, at their best I think D amp;D are mediocre writers. I think the main reason for this is that they are more concerned with what they themselves and their viewers think about the story rather than the story itself. They admitted that the Red Wedding was the reason they wanted to do the show, and up until that point they kept saying "just get to the RW". They just wanted to see that twist on screen, and see peoples' reactions. Then look at all their inside the episodes, and what really confirms this is they way they talk about all the decisions that *they themselves* made. For example, Lyanna Mormont's death. When they talk about the scene, they don't talk about it's importance to the battle or her character arc. They talk about using the actor, and they talk about how they "thought it would be cool to have her death scene play out this way" (not word for word but this is almost exactly what they said). And if you look into it even just a little bit, they have tons of similar quotes out there about how they do things either because they thought it would be cool or because the actor was good... NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE STORY NEEDS. Stoneheart being another big example- they didn't go with a huge (and awesome) plot from the books that even GRRM said was crucial because- yep, because they thought it was beneath the actor. So, for this reason they are definitely not great writers... but mediocre writing is better than NOT writing. Let me explain. So we all know that GRRM outlined the ending for them, and that this took a few days. We know that he has said that he knew where characters were going, but that their journeys and the details weren't there yet because he creates them as he goes along. We also know from both GRRM and D amp;D that the destination for both the show and the books are the same, just with different paths getting there. So here's the major problem: **Instead of creating their own path to GRRM's ending, they just filmed it happening.** This makes so much sense in context with how the show has gone. Seasons four and especially five were when they started having to create their own plot to finish adapting the books but get ready to end it, and this is where we start seeing the flaws really creep into the writing. Now we get to season six... and we know that GRRM has at least SOME of TWOW written, and probably has a lot more insight into what is going to happen in that book than ADOS since he is currently working on it. That's why I think season six had so much good stuff in it even if it isn't as strong of a season as 1-4. They pretty much got to make a season out of all the payoffs in TWOW that they had details about. Season six is probably all of the "journey" that GRRM was able to tell them, other than straight up endings. So while season five was when the show caught up to the books, season six was when D amp;D caught up to GRRM in terms of where he actually is in crafting the story, if that makes sense. So after season six, all they had was the endings that GRRM had told them about. This explains why they only wanted 13 episodes after that and shortened both seasons (even though HBO would give them an even bigger budget to do full seasons). Because they wouldn't be bothered too create their own paths for the characters to take to get to these final conclusions. They just took a few episodes in season seven to bring the characters together, then in season eight they just showed these moments happening. After detailing the plot points that affected season six, GRRM probably said something like: "*After the army of the dead is finally defeated, Dany eventually succombs to Targaryen madness and almost fully destroys kings landing in order to take it, and she has to be killed. Jaime ends up dying with Cersei, and Jon has to eventually face who he is and decide that it isn't what he wants.*" Obviously, there is so much more room for these plots to grow, and a severe NEED of development in order for the story to reach these points and have it make sense. But, like I said, instead of creating their own path, D amp;D just put the characters together and filmed the ending. **TL;DR- GRRM and D amp;D have said that the show and the books have the same destination with different paths getting there, and GRRM creates story as he goes, so he doesn't fully know the path to his destination yet. D amp;D should have come up with their own destination to that ending, even if they aren't the best writers. Instead, they used the meaty bits of TWOW's content to make season six, and made two rushed shortened seasons- one just to bring the characters in one place, and the second season just to film the ending without creating a sensible path to get there. This is why no character's end point feels real or makes sense- D amp;D think so highly of themselves that just having GRRM's ending will make their "brilliant" show good, but they've really just let us all down big time.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The contradiction: why I am okay with this episode and even enjoyed it while still being disappointed with the last season(s) and still hating D amp;D.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-20 03:04:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I made a post just a couple hours ago talking about how D amp;D ruined the show- it really boiled down to the show not only being rushed, but the fact that instead of making their own path to GRRM's ending D amp;D just made the ending happen with no development to set it up (which results in the nonsense that we've seen so much of). I still stand by that post and my thoughts on that subject 100%, and overall season 8 has been a slopfest... and that's a really generous term for it. However, all of that said: I started having issues with GOT in season four, with the mission to avenge Commander Mormont (mostly because it felt way too focused on action for such a story driven show), the whole fiasco with Yara being chased of by shirtless Ramsay and some dogs, and the exclusion of Lady Stoneheart. Over the ups and downs of the show since then, at times I felt like I was only invested because I wanted SOME glimpse of the ending- and I got that tonight. So that alone is something that I have wanted, and I'm happy I got it. As for the ending itself... I liked it. I feel like this will be an unpopular opinion, but it's the truth. Reading the leaks and having seen the last couple of episodes, I was sure I would hate it. Seeing it play out felt much more right to me though (yes, even "King Bran"). Sure, the episode was a bit choppy here and there... wouldn't expect any less after this season. But I actually thought the characters had good endings to their arcs- particularly Tyrion, Jon, and the Starks. Seeing this ending, I am now MORE than confident I will like the one Martin provides if he ever gets to it. I not only know he can do it better, and without the kind of silly endings for some of the minor characters (fuck everything to do with Bronn this season), but when he writes it the journey to that ending will be thrilling and it will make fucking sense. Character development will be an actual thing, and it won't just be a big twist ending for no reason. Also, on top of all that, there is still SOOOOO much that this version of the ending doesn't spoil. The actual long night and war for dawn, more information behind the others, Euron's significance, the children of the forest/Bloodraven, Lady fucking Stoneheart... and, most importantly, the final season's biggest flaw may actually be a blessing in disguise. Seeing Dany go full crazy Targ may be the ultimate payoff, but I honestly think her decent into that madness would be much more interesting to watch. And since the show didn't really give us that AT ALL, we can actually still go into Dany's story a little blind. I really look forward to seeing how GRRM develops her now. The same with Jaime and other characters who's ending doesn't make sense... I'm really excited to see how GRRM does it. Sure, it's possible that his transition won't be anymore believable, but with his track record of focusing on inner thoughts of characters' and their development (even to where it is almost a fault to some people in the two most recent books), I just don't buy it- I think he has some crazy roller coaster character arcs in store for us. From the beginning, I've been okay with mad queen Dany (it was honestly a theory I believed very likely for a while after reading ADWD), and I think I'm even okay with Jaime going back to Cersei... as long as it makes sense for thee story. I think GRRM will do that. Still, I'm not trying to give D amp;D a break. I hate what they did to these last two seasons, and I truly believe they just got lazy and wanted to move on to Star Wars. I also think they are not good writers overall, and even worse people. I really, really, really don't like them personally, and I wish we got the last seasons that we deserved for this story. Still, like I said, I'm okay with this ending. I've loved this story for so long, and it's meant so much to me. And after so much disappointment, I was able to let it go just a little- long enough to see this story end, and I'm glad I was able to do that. It wasn't the best experience I could ask for in ending a story I've loved this much, but it meant more to me than I thought it would. I think it's possible that I'll get the fully meaningful experience I wanted from the books now, though, and I hope we get there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Don't ever rely on the Money Network card that employers often give you.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-23 18:53:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I originally posted this on r/talesfromretail but I also have served a lot in the past and know that a lot of restaurants provide this same card. This might be common knowledge to a lot of you, but I had to figure things out in a not-so-fun way, so if my advice can help or persuade anyone to use a real bank or even just get paper checks, then awesome. So I work in a used book store (we sell a lot of other things as well), and I was given a Money Network visa card that says "bank of america" for all my payment because I don't have a bank account. I don't like banks personally, and I don't like to keep up with checking fees and whether or not I'm meeting the criteria to avoid them. Also, this card gave me my paychecks the night before payday at 9:30 EVERYTIME, which was earlier than anyone else got their pay with a bank. So I was content. However... fast forward to a couple weeks ago. Pay day arrives, I withdraw some cash and buy something at my store (not a huge purchase, about $20). I then head to the grocery store. As I walk into the store, I decide to check my account to get an exact number of how much money I have left (even though I had a rough idea in my head. I knew I had a little over $200 after taking out a good bit of cash... but when I look at my account balance, it says $10.95. Of course, I'm very angry and confused, and I look at my account details. Apparently, a $200 purchase was made at Sephora in Raleigh NC (far away from where I actually live). Obviously someone was able to use my card information, so I call the number on the money network card. Here's where the bullshit begins. The transaction was still pending, so they told me basically to call them back when it was no longer pending. They offered to put a hold on my card, I told them to wait (so I could use that last $10 since I was already so low on cash). I hang up, use my cash for my groceries (most of which was supposed to be for rent), and try to use that last $10. Apparently, they put the hold on my account after I told them not to. I was pissed, but figured it may have just been policy when someone told them their card was stolen (they should have made it clearer though). I call back, and tell them that I want to get a replacement card sent to me. After answering a bunch of their questions (I had to do this everytime, they make it take almost ten minutes just to talk to someone), they confirmed my address and told me a new card was on the way. The next day, the purchase was no longer pending. I call them back and ask how to get my money back. They tell me that they have to send me a form in the mail, I have to fill it out and mail it back (there is no electronic way to do this, apparently), and then they can START to dispute the claim. They told me the process to get my money back, IF I get my money back, will take 60-90 days. So basically I'm just fucked. So I'm already getting screwed over, but I try to move on. My parents help me out with $ as much as they can, and I get through the next couple of weeks. I check the mail every day, but I have gotten no form in the mail, and definitely no replacement card. So, two full weeks later, here we are- I get paid at 9:30 tonight, and after getting fucked over last week I NEED my money this time. I check the mail today and... of courses, no card. So I call them to ask for an update. Guess fucking what. They have no record of sending a card, and try to tell me I never asked for one. Imagine my frustration of waiting all this time, and having to jump through all their hoops to talk to their outsourced customer service from another country just to find out that they never did what they said they were going to do, and that I'm now fucked out of my money. They tell me I can use "money network checks" (which I've never heard of and certainly don't have). Since I don't have those, I talk with a "supervisor" who says that when I get paid they can do a one time lift of the hold on my card so I can withdraw my money from the atm. After my experience so far, I'm just hoping it's going to go down the way they said. **So, to sum up: Someone was able to spend my card IN STORE several states away without having it while I have to jump through every security loop imaginable just to get information about it. They put a hold on my card, claimed to send a new one but never did, and due to their process I'll either get my money back in a couple of months or never. All the while dealing with the most incompetent customer service I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to.** **I may not like dealing with physical banks, but it's MUCH better than this bullshit. I'll be setting up an account with one for my next direct deposit, and I'm going to tell everyone I can how shitty this service is and advise anyone I can against it. Fuck Money Network Visa Cards and FUCK "metabank" or whatever they actually are. I'm SOO mad right now.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Muse has risen the ranks to become among the elite of bands I love.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-23 19:10:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are tons of bands I love whole hell of a lot, but not quite as many where I get into their entire discography. I've loved Muse for a while, but maybe only listened to about half of what they have out there. Lately, after listening to them A LOT and especially seeing them live, I've decided to dig deeper into their discography. Now, Muse is up there with System of a Down, Porcupine Tree, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Mars Volta... bands I not only love, but am familiar with most-all of their discography and can play all of it on shuffle, always enjoying what I'm hearing. I just now made a playlist of the 20 or so Muse songs I'm not as familiar with, and listening to it I'm actually enjoying it a lot. Definitely Muse is one of my favorite bands by now, officially.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've gone back and forth a lot on which seasons I like more or less, but since the show has come to an end (and had time to deal with disappointments and frustrations), looking at the show as a whole I'm pretty confident in how I feel.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-29 05:17:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>When the show was good, it was SOMETHING ELSE kind of good... and I think my ranking of the seasons reflects that. My pick for first place is actually a three way tie. But here's about where I have the seasons ranked. **Sixth Place: Season 8-** Probably not a shock. It's the most flawed, rushed, sloppy, and overall weakest season of the lot in just about every way you can judge them, and it stings all the more because it's the actual ending. **Fifth Place: Season 7-** Even though I like some other seasons more than others, I don't think it's hard to see that in terms of writing and objective quality seasons 7-8 are a good step down from seasons 1-6. Other than s8, s7 has more plot-holes and lazy writing than any other season, and is also the beginning of the shows inexplicable "race to the finish line" where everything just starts getting very rushed. **Fourth Place: Season 5-** Even when it came out I thought people were a little too hard on this season. It had some flaws and deserved criticism, but it still felt like "Game of Thrones" and had some amazing moments. I was still loving the story. That said it didn't have as much excitement packed in as the season before it, and while I believe s4 is where the writing first showed signs of slipping s5 was the first real step down. It was where they caught up with GRRM and had to prepare the show for where "they wanted it to go". **Third Place: Season 2-** Even when it first came out, I feel like s2 wasn't quite as good as s1. It was better paced, the characters and tone felt more assured, and it had some amazing stuff... but the events just didn't feel as "monumental" or important as they did in the first season, and it almost just felt like a bridge from the begging in s1 and the meat of the show in s3. There are some great, GREAT stuff in this season, and like the other great seasons the last two episodes are amazing, but I just don't feel that the story it told beats the one from s1 (or s3 for that matter). **Second Place: Season 1-** It can be an awkward start for some, I've noticed. While there are lots of memorable stuff in the first episode, the show is definitely pretty slow in the start so it can set up such a massive story. Other than the initial shocks and twists that draw you in (i.e. Bran falling) it takes a few episodes to get going. The set-up vibe persists throughout the whole season, making it one of the slower ones, and it also has the daunting cast of establishing so many characters. However, other than having to get used to its own tone, characters, and writing, it's very well done and compelling. Still one of my favorite seasons to re-watch, and the last two episodes are among the show's best. **First Place: Seasons 3, 4, and 6-** So hear me out on this one. This decision was based on a mix of objective opinion and critique on these seasons AND my own personal enjoyment. I think if I were going only by my opinion on objective quality in terms of writing especially, s3 would win. It's got all the subtle writing that made us fall in love with the show and some of the best shocks and twists. All and all it was not only an exciting season but it was when the show REALLY started getting good. Moving on, while s4 arguably had more high points, I've also pointed out that it is where I feel that the show's writing starts to get a bit sloppy and we see D amp;D fall into some of their shortcomings. Their love of shock led to the start of a different tone, and the Cersei/Jaime rape scene was a huge mistake. Then there were also show plots that I didn't like (Greyjoy rescue and Craster's home set-piece). But it cannot be denied so many of the best moments are crammed in this season, and overall the story it tells is one of the best (though it suffers compared to the corresponding arcs in the books). As for s6, it kind of continues a long this pattern. Like s4, it has some sloppy writing but some amazing stuff as well. However, I think what makes it hard for me to compare the two seasons is that while s6 has lower lows, it also has much higher highs imo. The Arya plot was probably the most poorly written plot of the show so far, and there were some other issues with writing- including a lot less subtlety than seasons past. However, if I were to pick my three favorite moments of the show (or even five), they might all come from this season. And while there are issues with the writing throughout the season, I don't agree with the idea I've seen that the season is boring until the last two episodes. Home, Oathbreaker, Book of the Stranger, and The Door, were all GREAT episodes, and I enjoyed the next couple episodes before "No One" as well. But for me, even though Joff's wedding, Tyrion's trial, Oberyn's fight, The battle at the wall, and Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin (other stuff too) are all incredible... they don't beat Dany killing the khals, Hold the Door, Battle of the Bastards, Cersei blowing the sept, Arya killing Walder, R+L=J reveal/KITN, and Dany sailing west (also along with tons of other stuff) for me. The writing quality of s3 along with the brilliant moments in s4 and s6 (along with it being hard to compare 4 and 6 for me) pretty much make them tied for my favorite. Like I said when GOT is at it's best it's something else, and while I would include s1 and s2 in that statement I stil fill like these three seasons are the epitome of what I'm talking about. I know that the flaws of s6 give it some well earned criticism, but I still defend it (and s5 for that matter) as part of the "good days" of GOT. While D amp;D's writing certainly began to get lazier much earlier on, I don't think the show was really sunk by it until s7 and s8. Looking back, those are the seasons that I think the show doesn't even feel the same anymore, and s1-6 are still great in my book and at least belong together. These are just my opinions, and now that the show's over and I've had time to really form them I just felt like writing them out and sharing them. Feel free to add your thoughts and your own views on how the seasons rank, if you feel like it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Melodic rock songs with lots of energy and emotion but aren't really metal or emo (please read post)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-12 01:53:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title states, I'm looking for Rock music that has a lot of energy to it- it can even be heavy/hard rock, but without the distorted metal tone. A lot of typical vocalists from emo/scene bands don't really appeal to me, though. The type of vocals that sound deliberately "whiny" (I'm not knocking it, I think it's an artistic choice of the singer- just doesn't work for me). Also not looking for much growling, if any. Basically, I want high-energy songs that make you want to get up and move, with lots of emotion (without being overtly "emo" in genre). But still have clean vocals and melody. Bonus points for any "space-rock" vibes or generally being "theatrical". Some bands that might be examples are: Muse, Queen, Red Hot Chili Peppers, System of a Down (though I'm looking for something a little further from metal), and some of The Mars Volta. When thinking of recommendations, though, maybe keep these specific songs in mind: [Torture Me - RHCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFqUi0wdcQQ) [City of Delusion - Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmkj4mzUtrk) [Hypnotize - System of a Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZc1T3oxh_A) [Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkPWV97GQU) So obviously this can be pretty loose in terms of tone or even genre. Mostly just want it to have some semblance of that "rock umph" and I want to be able to *feel* it. Equal parts strong melody and emotion. And when I say I don't want "emo" music, I mean music of that genre- think bands like Taking Back Sunday, The Used, My Chemical Romance, and TONS of other bands that sing with that vocal style. I don't mean that the music can't be dark and emotional, I typically enjoy that. Just not [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv9zDC5HaKs) particular vocal style.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are your top "less obvious" episodes? (Spoilers for entire show)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-13 04:37:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Pretty simple, but let me clarify. There are some HUGE fucking episodes in this show. There are tons of popular favorites, like 35/36 (Gon VS. Hisoka) and 47(Kurapika VS. Uvo), 85 (Pitou VS.((ish)) Kite) and many other. On top of those big episodes, there are the "legends"... the big episodes that you would most like find at least one or two of in the top five of MOST fans... I'm of course talking about episodes like 116, 125/126, 131, and 135. There is so much depth, emotion, and or even just climactic tension packed into these episodes that it's easy to see why fans might consider them their favorites. So forget about all of those episodes. HxH is also full of small emotional beats, beautiful moments of character, and brilliant strokes of writing. So apart from the episodes already mentioned in this post, or ones that you just see people talk about a lot, what episodes do you love so much that you would put in THIS top five (some people may appreciate these episodes more, and in that case this may just be your actual top five). Even if it means I'm as basic as you can get for a HxH fan, I have to admit my top 5 is probably entirely composed of the "big" episodes mentioned above; but there are SO many less "climactic" ones that I love, and so here are my top five: Five - Episode 007: I just absolutely loved the way this episode developed Gon and Killua... from Killua revealing his backstory to their "match" against Netero, it was just a really fun episode that did an amazing job at building up these two characters from early on. Four - Episode 105: Komugi's backstory and explanation of why she bets her life in every gungi game is just beautiful. I love everything about that scene, and Meruem's reaction is a huge moment for his character. Three - Episode 112: When Pitou races to the king after the invasion, only to find Meruem holding Komugi's limp body with Netero and Zeno just watching... I get chills 100% of the time. But then when Meruem asks Pitou calmly to heal Komugi, and the music swells as tears roll down Pitou's face... and it's honestly one of the most emotional character moments in the show for me. Not just for Meruem, but I feel like it completely changed the way I saw Pitou for the rest of the arc. Two - Episode 108: The ending where Meruem saves Komugi and first realizes that he truly cares about her is one of the most beautiful and emotional moments in the show... but everything leading up to it is SO good too. The game they play, Komugi's awakening... and most importantly when the king asks for her name, and can't remember his own. The scene plays this so well, and then his whole conversation with the royal guard afterwards is SO well written. Every character has their own unique motivation and feelings, and Meruem in particular has such a well written duality of conflicting instincts. One - Episode 146: This is probably the "most obvious" of these choices, but I haven't seen it in most peoples' top five that I've talked to. It's awesome start to finish, with Gon finally meeting his father, Parristan's victory and games (especially that moment where he looks truly sad about Netero), and EVERYTHING with Killua and "something". The last third of this episode probably makes it the most emotional for me other than maybe 116 and 135.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>One of the worst things about season 8 is that I truly feel like Dany's eventual antagonistic role could have been one of the greatest character arcs of all time.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-23 06:26:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>She starts off by having her abusive brother sell her to a tribal warlord for his political gain, and has an amazing rise to power overcoming tons of obstacles (including the death of her husband and unborn son). She starts a huge crusade against slavery and not only gains a huge army and three dragons, but thousands of followers who LOVE her. All the while having a flair of the Targaryen "fire" in her. Especially in the books, we see a real conflict in her as she realizes she needs to embrace that side of her to get what she wants. If the final setbacks and blows to her were written better, and her character's decline MADE SENSE (as I'm sure it will in the books, with Aegon's plot along with Martin's deep care for character development) it would be an amazing arc. To have someone be such a focal character who is well rounded with noble intentions and real flaws try so hard to do the right thing that WE see her as what is basically the main protagonist... and have it hurt her over and over until her flaws undo her and create the final antagonist. I sincerely feel like THAT arc, along with what we've seen from Dany so far in the books, could potentially be a candidate for the best antagonist of all time. But the show not only spoiled this endgame, but rushed it so much that they butchered this transition to the point where it made no sense and just felt like a betrayal of the character. They sabotaged Martin's creative vision, Emilia Clarkes painstakingly hard work and brilliant performance, and our overall experience of one of the most prominent character arcs in all of fiction itself because they were "ready to do something else". Its frustrating to get a poor ending to a show we cared so much about, but to know what COULD have been in regards to this character straight up hurts me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My personal movie bucket list:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-25 02:06:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Growing up I was a junior movie buff, and lately I've really gotten back into it. At this point I've definitely seen quite a lot, but there's always some big ones out there I've missed. So I'm coming up with a list of movies I just HAVE to see. I have a few on there already, from classics like Ben-Hur and Citizen Kane to more random stuff like The Killing of a Sacred Deer. For those of you who have time, recommend me a movie I HAVE to see and at least give a small description of why I should. Seeing as this is a list for me, here's what you should know: I like ANY genre if it's done well, although sports movies take a lot for me to get into them. My only bias is horror, I can watch a shitty B-Horror any day, although I much prefer psychological or supernatural horror to gore-porn or slasher stuff. Other than that, I love great character writing and enthralling plots. My favorite directors include Danny Boyle, Darren Aronofsky, the Cohen brothers, and what Alex Garland has made so far (he's also one of my favorite authors). Some of my all time favorite films: * Pulp Fiction * Requiem for a Dream * The Cabin in the Woods * A Scanner Darkly * The Lord of the Rings trilogy * Donnie Darko * Fight Club * The Shawshank Redemption * A Dark Song * Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind * Moon * All of the "clerks" movies * American History X * Sunshine * Trainspotting * Gerald's Game Recently, I really enjoyed: * The Accountant * Mandy * Ready Player One * Dallas Buyers Club (way late on this one I know) * The Imitation Game (another one I was late to watching but loved) And like I said, I'm not a newcomer to film so I'll likely have seen a lot of the common suggestions, other than a few exceptions. But hopefully I can get some crucial movies to add to my list. So, what do I need to watch?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It's crazy how much hints and foreshadowing of what is to come can affect me when rewatching the anime.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-01 03:50:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's one of my favorite things about a re-watch. Quite a few episodes will hint at what's to come, particularly in the Chimera Ant arc, and while some may find it cheesy I love the way some of them make me feel when I fully know the road ahead. The one that fucking hits me 100% of the time: Komugi walks up to Meruem for the first time, and the narrator says that the King has no idea how much she will "influence his fate". The first time you watch this, it's intriguing but also easy to not put too much stock in it. You might be able to form some general ideas or assumptions about where that character will go, but with especially once the invasion starts its very small and somewhat easy to forget about. But having seen the arc in full, it hits me so hard every time. It's amazing how much she actually does change things for him... They're games are what causes him to get REALLY into strategy, affecting not only is capacity to "rule" but his strength and fighting style as well. The experience of having to endlessly develop new and new strategies against an enemy always ahead of him ended up allowing him to win the literal fight of his life. And obviously, the interactions that Meruem had with Komugi were what began to reveal the part of himself that was "human". Buut I love the choice to use the word fate. Every time I hear the narrator say that she will influence his fate, Meruem's entire journey kind of flashes in my mind subconsciously and I honestly even tear up sometimes. Instead of dying alone and empty, he died in the arms of his friend and closest companion. I don't know why but it just gets me really emotional. ALSO, anything to do with the King's name: everything from the queen announcing it for the first time, to the king discovering that he doesn't know it, to when Netero convinces Meruem to fight him in order to learn it, to when Netero is truly defeated in combat and tells the king at last, to Meruem's rebirth and embracing his name, to having Komugi say it one last time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does Meddle get more credit as the "start" of Pink Floyd's sound than Atom Heart Mother?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-18 14:14:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>This has nothing to do with which album is better, but it's always seemed strange to me that "Meddle" is so often cited as when the post-Barret Floyd found it's real proggy style, when "Atom Heart Mother" came first and to me it really feels like Pink Floyd coming into their own. They have the epic 25 minute "Atom Heart Mother Suite", and the other songs have a similar vibe to some of their later work imo. To, AHM is where they really became the epic prog-rock band that we know them as, and granted that style was honed much more into Meddle... but it's definitely apparent in AHM and I don't understand why it doesn't get more credit as the album that started their real style for their biggest albums. Is it just because people tend to enjoy Meddle more, or am I just misunderstanding what people mean when they say that Meddle was the start of Pink Floyd's new sound?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I found some songs by Serj Tankian and Scars on Broadway (and one other artist featuring Serj) to mix together for this, so basically this is my "fake System" album. I didn't use any of those songs out there that are actually songs from Scars that are edited to have Serj's vocals. But yeah, in an alternate timeline if they had just kept going on after Hypnotize without doing their own separate work (and without some of the Storaged Melodies stuff), there sixth album may have been a little bit like this. I know it's pointless, but it was fun for me to pretend. If nothing else, it makes for a fun "album".

    <TITLE>The more that time passes, the more Simulation Theory has come to be one of my favorite Muse albums.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-01 17:44:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really love how the entire album feels so different from what they have done before, yet it fully keeps the essence of what Muse is. I love seeing artists I enjoy experiment with new styles while still working around what they do best, and I feel that Simulation Theory is a prime example of this. This is obviously not the first album where Muse messed around with their formula- you *could* argue that they have done that with every album they release (some more than others, for sure), but I feel Simulation Theory has the best balance of new creative ideas and what makes the band good. I enjoyed all of the singles that came out before the album dropped (The Dark Side has grown on me even more since), but after multiple listens of the full record there are a ton of gems on this album. Break It To Me and Propaganda in particular are really impressive to me, while Algorithm and Blockades have risen to some of my all time favorites. I really love the aesthetic the tracklist has overall, but while they definitely sound like they belong together they each get to do their own thing. More than any of that, though, I've found myself coming back to the songs off Simulation Theory more than I do for many of their other records. Plus there is almost a full album's worth of alternate versions of the tracks to come back to, as well. I just genuinely love the music they came up with this time around, and it puts ST up there with the best. My current ranking is basically four sets of ties: 1. Origin of Symmetry - Black Holes and Revelations 2. Absolution - Simulation Theory 3. Showbiz - The Resistance 4. The 2nd Law - Drones I'm of the opinion that old Muse isn't really better than modern Muse (though I may be in the minority there), or vice versa. They're just a great band that has put out a lot of good music, and I think some of their best stuff can be found in both their earlier and latest work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>There's not some secret checklist that a movie has to complete to be a "horror film".</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-09 01:48:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is something I've been thinking a lot about lately, though I'm definitely not the first to bring it up. I have a friend that doesn't "hate" horror movies, but it's pretty obvious that he looks down on them a bit as a whole. The thing is, though, that when we come across one that he *does* enjoy, he likes to default to one of my least favorite sentences- one that we've all heard: **"but it's not really a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller."** It doesn't bother me at all that they label the film as a "psychological thriller", a lot of the time it is. The root of the problem for me is the *way* that the sentence is used, as a "justification" of sorts for liking the movie at all. A lot of people seem to feel "above" liking a horror film, but for some reason this term feels better to them. The truth is that one genre doesn't cancel out the other. Most films, especially the *good ones*, are a blend of multiple genres. In fact, the combination of psychological thriller and horror is extremely common, much like the relationship of fantasy and adventure. Often when my friend (other people I've noticed as well) make this claim I genuinely feel like the movie is **both**, and that they may have some bias towards the term "horror movie". When I hear people say this, it makes me wonder: *"What exactly do you think a horror movie is?"* I sometimes think people like that assume that a horror film has to be about a psychopath or demonic being that murders everyone in gruesome ways. Or that the moment the movie delves into psychological plots or themes, it immediately transcends the horror genre to become something else. "Horror" just isn't that specific or exclusive. To me, a horror movie is a movie that is designed to be "scary" as a **whole**. Any film can have some scary scenes or moments, but if the atmosphere of the movie is intended to inspire fear that's when I consider it to be a horror movie. Researching the definition of a "horror movie" brought up pretty much the same idea- if not even more vague than my own take. Obviously this leaves a lot of room for variance within the genre, especially keeping in mind that most movies don't just fall under *one label*. Horror movies can typical "slasher films" or ghost stories, but they can also be comedies, dramas, arthouse pictures, and of course, psychological thrillers. Most of the people on this sub would agree that there are some AMAZING horror films out there, but no matter how many movies of quality and substance are released people still seem to discredit the potential of the genre. I do think it's gotten a little better recently, and hopefully it continues to do so. But I wish people would realize that horror is **extremely** diverse, and that a horror film can be great without necessarily being a "psychological thriller". Rant-thing over.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-11 22:29:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's such a great fucking series. The second one was great, I loved the way it played with expectations that the first one set up. It honestly was just about as good as the first Scream in everything other than the end. Compared to the great ending of the original, it wasn't as surprising and didn't feel as significant. I don't get why people hate Scream 3 so much. It wasn't as good as the first two, but I really enjoyed the extra meta approach for the movie. It was probably my least favorite ending, and I think it had the weakest characters of the franchise (with the interesting main characters having the least to do), but I still really enjoyed it. Also, not that it's any basis of quality, but I loved the Jay and Silent Bob cameo! Scream 4 was easily my favorite of the series other than the first one. It was really fucking clever at times, and it had one of the best casts as well. The original characters had enough to do and I really enjoyed the new ones too. Plus it was my favorite ending other than the original movie. I was really satisfied with it!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>There are more found footage movies worth watching than you'd expect.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-13 03:52:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Obviously there's a TON of crappy found footage films, and at times it's a way to use the genre as an excuse for a low effort film. But there are actually more interesting movies in the sub-genre than there should be. And every time a FF movie comes out that's kind of good people are like "finally, a found footage film I don't hate". But look at how many good ones there actually are: * As Above, So Below * Creep * Hell House, LLC * V/H/S * V/H/S 2 * Trollhunter * REC * The Last Exorcism * The Bay * Lake Mungo * The Visit * The Blair Witch Project Of course not everyone will like every one of those movies, but there are still plenty of others worth watching. I know there's tons of crappy films in the found footage sub-genre - probably the majority of it. But it's surprising how many great FF movies there actually are. Edit: There are tons of great movies here, I can't list them all. I was just trying to point out that for such a sub-genre that is presumably a bunch of bad movies, there sure are a bunch of good ones.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's your favorite short from a horror anthology?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-30 04:02:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>For myself, it's probably "Amateur Night", the first short from the original "V/H/S". It's very rare for a horror movie to creep me out, but something about this one actually did just that. Something about the way that chick looks at the camera, just saying "I like you," over and over again. It really worked for me. Oddly enough, I'm also partial to some of the more bizarre shorts from "Holidays". The Easter and Saint Patrick's Day ones in particular, though I'm sure those are not the most popular of that collection. I just loved how balls to the walls bizarre and fucked up they were. What about you guys?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I was making charts on Topsters and ended up making my Top 100 Horror films.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-02 05:44:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>[This](https://imgur.com/fD3lGJc) is about as accurate as I can make it right now. I keep a list of every horror movie I've seen, and I went over it several times to make sure I included all my favorites. I also put a lot of effort into actually ranking it, though my opinions change so frequently that it can never be exact (plus it's just hard to compare some of these movies). I would be 100% interested in seeing a similar chart from anyone else, but if that's all too much I'd still be interested in some of your favorites. But I just thought it would be fun to share this after all the work I put into it, and I'm also interested in your opinions or questions about this chart. Some things to note, though: * There are tons of amazing horror films out there, and while I'm pretty confident that these are my top 100 there are still tons of movies I wish I could include. I'll add some honorable mentions in a comment. * There are a couple of movies I included that may not have the right cover on the chart. In these cases, Topster didn't seem to have the exact movie, so I just included one that had the same name with the most likely cover. I think this only happened once or twice (with Raw for sure), and I'm sure most of you will know which movie I mean. * My opinion of the films' objective quality is definitely taken into account, but the final ranking mostly comes down to my personal enjoyment of the movie. * These are horror films by my own definition. I know that some people may not consider a few of these to be "horror movies", and that's totally okay. I included them because I count them as part of the genre (which I consider to be wider than most people do). I'm totally willing to explain why I consider any of these movies to be horror, as well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>White God on Shudder was great!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-17 01:25:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll be honest, when I realized what the premise was going to be I was a little skeptical. But I have to say this movie won me over in almost every way. It's amazing how much of this movie was able to be compelling while pretty much just following the POV of street dogs. I found it emotional, cathartic, and at times hard to watch. The cinematography was awesome, too. Somebody get that dog an oscar. I could see people not liking this one, but for me my ONLY criticism is that it maybe could have been a little shorter. Maybe, but honestly it was just a really great (if brutal) movie. Not sure how much of a horror film it is, but it's pretty hard to label in general I think. It's on Shudder though, if you haven't seen it you should give it a shot. If you have seen it, what did you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I despise not being able to live alone.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-22 01:32:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm probably going to come across as a shitty person, maybe I am. I have a few close friends, and I really do care about them. I live with two of them (although one often doesn't stay at the house). That said, I really enjoy being alone most of the time. Way more than other people seem to, and the older I get the more I feel this way. The truth is, I've come to find that people tend to annoy me in most situations. This isn't a "I'm better than them" type of thing, it's just that having to keep up conversation, mutually planning activities together, and dealing with human drama just drains the ever loving fuck out of me, and I'd rather spend my time with my dog, reading/writing, listening to music, relaxing outside or watching movies. I have hobbies, I go to work, but in my free time I've just found that nothing is more appealing to me than being on my own. I enjoy spending time with my friends on occasion, but most people just want to be around each other all the time. Human's are social creatures supposedly, but I just feel like it doesn't apply to me. I can never fathom why people want to be around each other so much. And my friends get their feelings hurt because I don't want to hang out several times a week, and that just creates more drama I don't want to deal with. Then there's the fact that I am not financially in a position to live on my own, so I live with one of my friends (and financially this situation is near impossible to beat where I live, because they are renting the home from a family member). And they will invite friends over all the time and I'll have no idea. And that doesn't bother me, it's their house too... but no one seems to understand that someone pounding on my door shouting "YOOOO GET OUT HERE LETS CHILL" is NOT what I had planned on or felt up to that day. And then when I get really anti-social, people always seem to stand in the Kitchen talking when I want to grab something to eat. And they always try to rope me into long and drunken conversations I have no interest in, so I just go without. And I end up REALLY bitter, and I hate that. And I know this is a character flaw of mine. I know I should want to be around people more, but from the bottom of my heart I just don't. And it scares me sometimes, because while I would love to find a romantic partner (I've been single for many years now), I feel like it's possible I'll never find one if I stay like this. But when everyone I know just seems to want to be around each other 24/7, drink so much that they cannot stop talking and have no clue what they are even talking about anymore, I just can't help it if I'd rather spend a quiet day alone most of the time. I really just wanted to get this rant off my chest. I don't hate people, and I do care about my friends. It's just concerning how much of my free time I want to spend alone, and yet that's truly how I feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been watching a lot of documentaries lately, and I'm looking for recommendations for good ones that are free on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime. The topics I am interested in: * Space: cosmos, galaxies, black holes, planets, pretty much anything like that * History: Prehistoric, eastern/western civ type stuff and world history, but also American history especially about war or government * Pop Culture: about pop culture or media in general, or about the impacts of certain genres of music and visual media. Really this category can be pretty open. If I'm being honest these are the subjects I am really interested in, so if you've seen any good ones on these streaming sites lately please let me know. I am open to other topics if they were REALLY good. I would have mentioned nature docs, but I have seen SO MANY of those.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking for some recommendations for non-prog rock bands from my fellow Volta fans</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-10 04:03:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Always looking for good new music, and anyone who loves TMV has good taste in my book. I love prog rock - The Mars Volta, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, and Tool are all among my favorite bands of all time. But right now I'm looking for some good rock bands that aren't traditional prog rock. I'm also not really looking for metal, at least not the really heavy distorted stuff or screamo/growling vocals. Most of the time, I'm also not big on overly emo music (in terms of genre, don't care about the band's fashion lol). Hard rock would be awesome though. Some of my favorite artists that aren't technically prog are: * Muse * System of a Down (one of the only bands where the growling doesn't bother me) * Ninet Tayeb * Red Hot Chili Peppers * Soundgarden * Queens of the Stone Age * Alice in Chains It can have similarities to TMV or not, I'm just coming to this community for recommendations because The Mars Volta is pretty close to the maximum amount I can enjoy music, so if anyone can send me in the right direction it's other people who love this band. Thank you so much in advance to anyone who takes the time to suggest anything. Hope you are all doing well.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-11 08:24:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Marked as a spoiler for the sake of discussion. I thought it was a great start to the season. It wasn't one of my absolute favorites of the entire show, but I think it felt like a "classic" episode. The signature Rick and Morty humor was on point, and it definitely demonstrates that the show has plenty of life left in it yet. All in all, I thought it was a really well balanced episode that knew how to play to the strengths of the series, and I'm excited for the rest of the season. In terms of how it compares to the show's other episodes, I took the time to rank them all because I have no life. Keep in mind that while some episodes felt a little more average to me, there are none I didn't like or enjoy at all - not even the one in last place. Let me know what you thought about the premiere, or how your ranking might compare or differ. 32. 1x03 - Anatomy Park 31. 1x07 - Raising Gazorpazorp 30. 2x08 - Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate 29. 3x02 - Rickmancing the Stone 28. 1x04 - M.

    <TITLE>It's insane how many horror films I still want to see with how long I've spent watching them, and how many I've already seen.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-13 08:20:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Earlier this year I decided to track down and log every horror movie I've seen, going year by year. I decided from that point forward to keep track of them, as well as any new ones I see. And even now, having seen 900+ horror movies (including films that branch into other genres but maintain horror elements), it's crazy to me how many I still haven't seen. Not just that, but even after all this time I can't help but feel I'm missing out on many great films. There are literally hundreds of movies I still want to see, and along with plenty others that I would probably love but don't know about. I've loved horror from a very young age, but if there's one thing I've learned from seeing so many over the years it's just how damn diverse the genre is, and anyone who claims that there aren't many "good" horror movies really doesn't know what they are talking about. There are so many amazing films I've come across, and still so many I'm excited to see... I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I guess I'm just appreciative of how much entertainment I've gotten from this hobby, and felt like sharing how I'm feeling about it right now. Once upon a time (a long time ago) I felt that a "very good" horror movie was pretty few and far between, and while the genre has as much mediocrity as any other, I now know that it is stuffed with great movies. Does anyone else enjoy keeping up with the films they've seen and keeping some kind of a record of how much you enjoyed them? Or are there any hidden gems you feel strongly about that seem to get lost in the massive sea of horror movies out there? I felt like expressing my nostalgia for the time I've spent watching these films, but I'm also interested in your thoughts and experiences with horror.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So many large parties make me sick</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-13 19:55:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is it a hive mind thing that so many parties of 15+ just become total assholes that don't for one second consider the employees they are shitting all over at all? I've had some large parties that have been great, don't get me wrong, but I don't know if it's luck or an actual pattern but most of the time if there are more than 12 people they are a nightmare to deal with and take up a large portion of your time and section only to absolutely fuck you on the tip. I've been thinking about this a lot thanks to a party from a week or so back, and it's like they were going through a checklist of everything they could do to be difficult. So I work at a breakfast diner that is only open from 2:00 PM. Apart from me never having really been an early riser, I've gotten used to it because the schedule is honestly great - no late nights ever, and no going back and forth between opening and working in the evening. It's consistent, shifts are usually 8-9 hours at the longest. Since we close so early, we are used to being on a wait pretty close to when we close, and we are also used to being there late due to finishing up with the late-comers and then having to do sidework. Even being used to this, though, this party was fucking insane. So they call us, a place that closes at 2:00pm, and said there would be 35 people coming at 1:30. Of course that is great for our sales for the day, and we are 100% a corporate restaurant, so management approved this in a heartbeat. Most employees weren't happy about it, but as long as the party was on time it wasn't the end of the world. There would still be thirty minutes until close, and large parties can be turned an hour or so... so weren't expecting it to be anymore ridiculous than usual. The first person got there at 1:55. Yep, the first person in the party of 35 people got there 5 minutes before closing, 25 minutes after they had agreed to have the full party there. And I swear, they never showed up more than two or three at a time, and people were still coming at 2:45pm. We had 2 servers taking care of them (myself included) with other people helping, but everybody was ordering on their own, paying on their own, and having their own "issues" with the food that needed correcting. We had people sending back food they "didn't like" and ordering entirely different meals well after 3:00pm. And a few of them were expecting to have their bill the minute they finished, and were expecting us to get them in and out of there while we were spending hours trying to help the rest of the party. Most of them were pretty rude the entire time, I think only a couple of them ever said "thank you" at all, and "please" was way out the window. They were not only running me and their other server around like crazy, but anyone else who dared help us and set foot in that room got worked to death as well. And this is no exaggeration, about 20% or more of them had some issue with the food they ordered and wanted to change something or order another dish entirely. It was a damn nightmare, and it wasn't until about 4:00 that most of them had finished and cashed out. They didn't leave, though. They stood around a table that was *trashed*, not just because they were messy but because they gave us very little time to pre-bus... and whenever we tried, they told us not to. So they just stood there, talking and taking pictures. We started to try and clean up around them, and they told us to stop. They told us to give them some space, and they would be gone "soon". That was the thing that pissed me off the most. We were already there hours past closing and had so much to clean up, and they somehow got the idea that we shouldn't be able to clean up while they were still there. When they finally left and all of the separate tips were added up, it was less than 10% overall. We weren't out of the building until well after 5:0pm, as we had to clean up after them and wait until all their silverware was done. One of the worst things is that management never decided that that the party of that says was arriving too late, or stood up to them when they walked all over us. To any managers out there: I know it's crucial to get your sales as high as possible. I've been in that position myself. But there is a point where you can't let customers treat your staff like this, and if a party that large arrives when you are pretty much closed, I think it's reasonable to tell them that it is past the agreed upon time and we will be close before a party that large can be taken care of. And I know most people here are in the industry, but if you are ever in a large party going out to eat please think of the employees who are BUSTING THEIR ASSES to make sure you have a good time, and try to get the rest of your party to act like civilized human beings. This party was over a week ago and I'm still upset about it. **tl;dr - party of 35 says they will arrive 30 minutes to close, and the first person shows up at 5 minutes to close. They continue to arrive in waves over the next hour, and treat the staff like shit. They run everyone to death, not just their own servers, and send a large portion of their food back, ordering different entrees long after we were supposed to close. They all payed and ordered separately, and a couple of them expected to be cashed out immediately.** **They finally finish, and stand around talking and taking pictures for about half an hour. They rudely tell us not to pre-bus or clean until every last one of them is gone. After they finally leave, and we are there cleaning up after them LONG after we close, we find that their added up tips are less than 10%.** **Thank you for letting me rant.**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Scars on Broadway is much more than just "System of a Down lite".</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-07 03:48:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realize that for some of you I'm preaching to the choir, but I've seen a lot of people with this sentiment. I've even had a few friends who were huge fans of System, but would listen to part of a Scars song and refuse to give the band a shot, saying it "wasn't as good as System", or that "it's not the same without Serj". I technically agree with both of those sentences, seeing as I do prefer System of a Down to Scars on Broadway by a large margin... I just don't think that's a good reason to skip out on the band, or at least giving it a real chance. As I've listened to Daron's music with Scars more and more, I've become really aware of how much of it does have a style distinctly different from System of a Down. Sure, there are songs that really do feel like System songs without Serj, such as Stoner Hate, Angry Guru, Dictator, and so on (and I still really enjoy those songs). But listening to songs like Talkin Shit, Hungry Ghost, Babylon, or 3005... It has so much less "metal" than System and veers more into a very specific style of "rock" that you don't really hear anywhere else. Even songs like They Say and Guns Are Loaded feel very different from the music Daron did with System, and while you can definitely find similarities I feel like they have that signature type of "careless rock vibe" that is synonymous with Scars on Broadway. I know some of those songs were likely going to be done with System, but I have a feeling they would have come out VERY different if they had. But while the band has some similar elements to System (and yeah some songs have a lot of similar elements), it has it's own sound that's viable on it's own. I like Rage Against the Machine more than Audioslave, but I still feel like listening to Audioslave sometimes. It's the same here, I may like System more overall, but there are plenty of times where I feel like listening to Scars more. I just wish more people wouldn't give it up instantly as soon as they hear that Serj isn't singing. That's all. And to any casual fans on this sub who haven't listened to Scars on Broadway, you really should. I know I just went on and on about how Scars is more than just a System "spin-off" (and it really is more), but they're still worth checking out for anyone into SOAD. The fact that Scars has more music coming out really makes the lack of a new SOAD album more bearable, too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ten reasons you should watch "The Clone Wars", the animated series.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-09 03:03:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I realize this is [r/StarWars](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/), and that most of you have probably already seen the show. But I love writing little things like this, and I do it all the time. I was just thinking about the things I enjoy in the show, I ended up writing this out. I just figured I'd share it here for the fun of it - and if I can turn even just a single person on to the show and have them enjoy it, all the better. **WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH  #8220;THE CLONE WARS #8221;, THE ANIMATED SERIES** The Clone Wars is an animated  #8220;kid #8217;s show #8221;, and it admittedly feels like it in the first few episodes. However, as the show goes on, it starts to feel less and less like a show for children and more like #8230; well, *Star Wars*. That #8217;s not to say that Star Wars isn #8217;t for children in general, but this saga has always had an  #8220;ageless charm #8221; that appeals to anyone, adult and child alike. And when the show gets going, The Clone Wars is no different. It genuinely feels like a natural part of the Star Wars universe, and it only gets better as it goes on. It #8217;s a must watch for fans of Star Wars, and here are ten reasons why: **10.** **A massive expansion of the Star Wars universe and its lore -** One of the best things about Star Wars has always been its vast and fascinating universe, and a show like The Clone Wars has a lot more time to explore new parts of that. There are new worlds, technologies, characters, mystical forces (pun intended), creatures, and more information on the history of the universe that those who have only seen the movies are missing out on. **09. The War Itself -** Something that the prequel trilogy kind of glossed over a bit was the actual Clone War. The war only begins at the very end of the second film, and only really serves as a plot device in the third as it comes to an end. We never really get to see the majority of the war with all its battles, strategies, political challenges, and most importantly the comradery and livelihood of the soldiers. This changes with The Clone Wars, which devotes nearly 50 hours to all of this. You get a much better idea of how massive this war is and how it affected those who lived through it, plus you get a massive chunk of the Star Wars story to boot. **08. The Clones -** One major highlight of the shows is the clones themselves. They are handled very well, and cease to be just faceless soldiers that we know nothing about. They may be clones, but they are still individuals. They have their own personalities, strengths, and even have their own  #8220;style #8221; that sets them apart from each other visually. Some even abandon the war to pursue their own dreams, or even betray the republic out of self interest. But for the most part, they share a sense of unity despite their differences, and they really feel like a family. A few of them become truly fascinating characters, and getting to know these soldiers really enhances the story of this war. **07. The Jedi Council -** Another thing that the show gets to devote more time towards is the massive cast of characters in Star Wars, including the Jedi Council. You not only get to see more of how they operate, but you get to see more of the characters who were mostly in the background during the films. It #8217;s always cool to see the Jedi in action, and some of the Jedi that we hadn #8217;t seen much of are really interesting characters with a lot of potential #8230; potential that this show gets to explore. **06. More of Anakin #8217;s Transition -** The films can only show so much, and while Attack of the Clone foreshadows Anakin #8217;s fall to the dark side quite a bit, most of his actual transition takes place in the third film. Taking place in between the two movies, you not only get to see more of this, but it has more of an impact. You get to see how close Anakin and Obi-Wan get, and how great of a warrior Anakin is despite the fact that he #8217;s a bit of a hot-head. It also does a better job than the films in showing the deep relationship he has with Padme. All of this adds to give more weight to Anakin #8217;s inevitable turn (simultaneously making it more believable), and the little moments of the show that hint at this fate are really cool. **05. Obi-Wan is a Boss -** Something we all already know. Obi-Wan is just awesome, and is easily one of the best characters in the entirety of Star Wars. Being one of the most important characters in The Clone Wars, Obi-Wan gets a lot of time to shine over the course of the show #8230; both as a character, and as a capable general of the war. **04. Tie-Ins with the Films -** The show is also filled with references, easter eggs, and even straight up connections to the films and other portions of Star Wars canon. I won #8217;t go into spoilers, but it #8217;s safe to say that fans who have seen the rest of the saga will enjoy certain bits of this show. And even when it isn #8217;t directly correlating with what we see in the films, but the show is constantly providing additional background on the places, characters, and events that we have seen in the films. **03. Palpatine #8217;s Manipulation of the Republic and the War -** We know from the film #8217;s that the entire war was a construct of Palpatine and his rise to power. The Clone Wars shows more of this, and provides a deeper look into the government and its central players during the war. It #8217;s cool to see the pieces moving towards what ultimately happens in Revenge of the Sith, and knowing how Palpatine is manipulating everyone before they know it is very entertaining. **02. A Deeper Look and the Confederacy of Independent Systems -** In the prequel trilogy, the CIS doesn #8217;t get much focus. It #8217;s interesting to see how much they are being played by Palpatine just like the Republic, even if they have very naturally opposing values as well. Also, there are interesting characters that play a big part in the show that are never featured in the films. **01. It #8217;s More Star Wars -** It #8217;s over 40 hours of Star Wars story that is generally well received. What more do you want?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I'm not sure you're asking about what happens in the future of the show, but if you REALLY want to know I'll answer with a spoiler tag. Truth is, I don't remember 100%, but I'm pretty sure that  gt;!She does not ever show back up! lt;
    2. I and most any other fan would definitely say the quality dips after a while. I'd say S4 is the peak, and after that there's a dip. I still enjoyed S5, S6, and some of S7, but I kind of got bored and stopped watching during S8. I don't hear great things about it these days, sadly. 3. Again, if you really want to know -  gt;!Yes, it is definitely showcased more. Mickey unfortunately leaves the show at one point, but apparently he's back in the current show, which happened after I stopped watching! lt;
    4. Spoiler:  gt;!Again I'm not current, but she KIND OF settled a bit by the point I had left off, but I've heard that she kind of goes through some shit again; she left the show, and I'm not sure how she was at the end of her arc! lt;
    5. Even in spoiler tags, I really don't want to answer this one. In short, at least until after S4-S6, I'd just watch and stop asking so many questions... it'll ruin the fun for you ;)</TEXT>

I'm 100% willing to do whatever it takes and put as much work into it as I need to. I want to take some time and build up a portfolio before I start looking for jobs, but I wanted to know more about that process for when I come to it.

    <TEXT>I think it's a matter of perspective. For some people, the ending is so important that a bad one will ruin the whole show no matter how great it was. Others may still be able to appreciate not just the quality of what came before the ending, but how the journey made them feel. I'm somewhere in between, but I do lean a little towards the first: I still appreciate how good the show was, but an ending is also really important to me, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't change the way I see the whole show at least a little. I can really see it both ways, though.</TEXT>

It can really ruin their experience, and it sucks that it kind of stressed you out during your peak. I have a close friend who had people messing with him during his first trip, and it really bothered him. I hate that, my first trip was sooooo wonderful and I can't imagine wanting to get in the way of somebody else having that experience. Yeah, MDA is crazy though. It does get very trippy.

    <TEXT>I prefer shrooms, but both honestly have pros and cons. Shrooms don't last as long, about 4-5 hours of solid tripping (maybe a little more if they are really good), and they are WAY less stimulating. In fact, shrooms give me the "yawns" lol. The visuals from shrooms are less defined than LSD, less shifting patterns and more "wavy" "morphy" type stuff. It's a very dreamy experience. Shrooms come in waves, whereas acid you tend to just steadily trip harder and harder until the peak. Shrooms are also way easier on your body, and it sounds like a cliche but they feel much more "natural". One downside is that shrooms can be a bit more confusing, especially at high doses. LSD is stronger but more lucid, and shrooms you can get lost in your head a bit more. Still, overall I think the experience is more friendly on the user with shrooms.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Top 100 Horror Films - anyone else have a topsters chart to share?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-09 07:28:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Here is my current top 100](https://imgur.com/qjofPbk). It changes so frequently, so the order might not be *absolutely perfect* but it is a very general ranking of my favorite to least favorite. I love horror films, and this isn't even 10% of the horror movies I've seen... so it was really hard to narrow it down and a ton of movies I LOVE didn't make the cut. For that reason I'll include some honorable mentions below. I'm interested in your rankings too! Whether it's your top 100, top 50, top 20 or just your top 5. The topsters charts are fun to make, but you can just write out your favorites here if you feel like it. I don't know how many people will see this and feel like sharing, but I look forward to seeing the picks of anyone who does! Some of my honorable mentions: these are not ALL of the other horror films I love, just the favorites that didn't make the top 100 that I still HAD to mention... If I were to list every horror movie I love, this post would be insane. The Changeling, Evil Dead (trilogy), Demons, Re-Animator, Dark Waters, Dagon, High Tension, The Descent, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Orphanage, 1408, Pontypool, The Last Exorcism, Insidious, The Conjuring (1 amp;2), Kill List, Resolution, The Bay, The Border Lands (Final Prayer), Banshee Chapter, Digging Up the Marrow, They Look Like People, The Blair Witch Project, Green Room, We Go On, The Wailing, The Girl With All the Gifts, The Witch in the Window, Doctor Sleep, The Love Witch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, Cabin is at the top because a) it was one of the most fun movies I ever watched, and b) because I love how it acts as an homage to the genre. And I personally didn't love some of those movies as much as the rest of the horror community did, specifically Hereditary and The Witch. I mean they're in my top 100 so obviously I still think they are great, but I don't put them AS high up in my ranking as many others seem to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dammit, I really hope Disney doesn't start getting cocky. As a fan of this universe, I would rather hear that the movie was delayed to get everything right than hear stuff like this. I'm afraid that if the first director was worried about the deadline, and they now how to scramble for a new one, that it might affect this movie in a pretty negative way. Which is a bummer, this is one I've been really excited about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately I don't see it available to stream anywhere as of now, unless you're subscribed to FXNow. But it's just a fun space sci-fi/horror/thriller that came out a couple years back. It isn't the most original movie in the world, but I feel it makes up for it with a fun cast and some thrilling sequences. I'd say it's worth the watch if you ever get the chance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did. Sadly, "nothing but bad things" is more or less accurate. It wasn't HORRIBLE to watch, but it's definitely a bit all over the place. The worst thing was that it was just pretty boring. It only got less and less tense/interesting the longer it went on, and the ending was crazy anti-climatic. I was actually rooting for it, I liked the Ju-On series and parts of the 2004 remake, and I like Nicolas Pesce. But yeah, it wasn't very good.</TEXT>

I have been watching it as it aired since episode one, and it's fun to digest them... but if I was catching up now, once I got to the thick of it I probably wouldn't be able to keep myself from binging it.

    <TITLE>Hunter X Hunter might be my favorite story. Ever. From any medium.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-11 00:32:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've known for **years** now that HxH is very special to me, and that it has both impressed me with its writing and reached me emotionally in a way that not many shows, movies, or books have done. But the more I think about it lately, I think it was the perfect story for me personally. It has: * Fantastic characters, like **tons** of them, all with a sense of wholeness and real development. * A well realized world that still has so much more potential for imagination and discovery. * Amazing writing when it comes to protagonist and antagonistic roles, and is filled with gray characters with their own specific motivations * A general unpredictability and a subversion of expectations that not only persists throughout the story, but doesn't feel like ass-pulls. It's organic and enhances the story. * A sense of journey- this one is something that I've always loved in shows... it felt like a HUGE adventure that started simple, became massive, and then came full circle. * A perfect balance of light and dark within the story. Enough positivity that you can reflect on the happy parts of the story in a nostalgic way, but it can also get dark and bleak enough to reflect the harshness of reality and at times break your heart. * For an action/adventure story, there are some truly beautiful moments. * It's a story that is still going, and has potential to be a "never-ending story", which is not only awesome because any more material is welcome but because it allows the imagination to keep living in this world. BUT this is truly impressive because it does have a great ending point (where the 2011 anime leaves off) that wraps up a lot of what the original story set out to do. It's a great duality of the world continuing to go on but still getting some closure. * All the other details: the intricate and unique power system that enhances the characters and allows for such detailed and strategic battles, the themes that are incorporated into the story (from morality, war, politics, friendship, loss, trauma, and so much more), and particularly in the anime the animation, sound design/OST and voice acting. That's all, sorry for the fanboy rant. I just love this story more as time keeps passing, and I felt like ranting. Carry on.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-11 03:55:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I watch a lot of horror movies, and lately I've been feeling stuff from the 70's and 80's. I'd love to get some recommendations for movies in that time period that are supernatural or paranormal in nature- particularly hauntings and ghost stories, but anything supernatural is appreciated. However, I've seen pretty much all of the really popular and/or famous ones, so more obscure recommendations are appreciated. It doesn't have to be CRAZY obscure, just try to avoid suggesting stuff that a horror enthusiast has probably already seen. Films that were popular but not often mentioned these days, hidden gems, or underrated would be great. Thanks so much in advance to anyone who leaves a suggestion. Hope you're all doing well!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I haven't really seen it talked about here either. I found it while looking through JustWatch with a bunch of filters. It was unsettling though, the whole thing was pretty clever. I've seen the "bookend" sections get a little flack, but honestly that context was fun... and it gave the film itself an excuse for some genuinely creepy experimentation imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I absolutely and whole heartedly agree with you. Then again, I'm also one of the ones who enjoys all of their albums, and even though Drones and T2L aren't my favorite albums (both have some fantastic songs don't get me wrong) I'm really impressed with the general direction they've taken the band. On the subject of Simulation Theory, it's in my top four Muse albums, pretty close to Absolution and above Showbiz and The Resistance. The only albums I like considerably more are OoS and BHAR. I'm not crazy about Get Up and Fight, but I think every other song on the record ranges from great to amazing. I've enjoyed Muse for over a decade now, but in the past year or so they've fast become one of my all time favorite bands. And ST is one of my favorite albums from any band to come out in the past few years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These are very valid criticisms that I don't personally agree with, if that makes sense. I just mean that I didn't have those issues myself, but I can 100% understand why somebody would and a lot of people feel that way. For me, I was engaged from the beginning. The characters were just so interesting, and even in episode one from the moment Kurapika gave his scarlet eye/revenge back story I wasn't too concerned about it being a kid's show. And in hindsight, that much lighter tone in the beginning is actually a part of what I loved, that duality of light and dark moments throughout the show. As for the Chimera Ant arc, I did feel that way a bit during my first watch through. I had zero complaints about the pacing until they started teasing Gon vs. Pitou and Netero vs. Meruem. After that, there were times where I thought it was moving too slowly. But it wasn't that the episodes weren't entertaining me, it was just that I was THAT hyped for what was to come. After a while I remember breaking down and googling "what episode does Netero fight the King", and I remember being flabbergasted by how far away it was. Upon reflection and every rewatch since, I couldn't disagree with past me more. For a 60 episode arc, every damn episode was crucial to the characters and story, the more I go back to rewatch the more I realize just how many of those 60 episodes feature some of my favorite moments. Seriously, looking through each of those 60 episodes individually it's honestly shocking how many times I might say to myself "Oh shit, THAT episode!". I get people's issues with the CA arc, and the show as a whole for that matter. I just never saw them as flaws, which is another part of why it's like God appeared and said "yo, subject2390, here's Hunter X Hunter. I made it for you, enjoy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't feel the same, but weed has always hit me differently than it seems to for most others. My first few times were psychedelic as hell, to the point where I would freak out or have a panic attack. I would feel great at first, but after a while and the effects peaked I would get way too deep in my own head and I would get CRAZY high. I was really young and all my friends were smoking, so despite all this I just kept trying it... which may not have been the smart thing to do, but I'm actually glad I did. Because for me, weed has gotten SO MUCH better for me over the years. I get a lot more of the "relaxed" vibe it's known for after developing a little more of a tolerance, but I'm still able to get a fair amount of the "psychedelic" effects as well- a combo that mixes very well. I can still get a little anxiety if I smoke too much, but it's not nearly as bad as it was and it's also very easy to avoid. I just don't go crazy with my usage. I smoke every day, but I don't smoke a lot at once and I spread it out throughout the day... though a bit more at night. I also don't use bongs anymore. I found that the high I get from bongs is more prone to giving me anxiety, plus I hate coughing from smoke (like REALLY coughing that is). I smoke weed to relax after work or spark some creativity, and hacking my lungs up and getting a high that makes me tense is just counter productive. I've gotten very confident in my smoking habits, despite that even in my late 20's people still seem to have that "nah fuck that its just weed HIT THAT SHIIITT". I know what I want, and weed is amazing for me- but only if I don't abuse it. And when I talk about the psychedelic effects of weed, it really does hit me that way, I'm not just a huge light weight. I LOVE hallucinogens, everything from dissos to psychedelics and I am very experienced. I've tripped hundreds (and hundreds) of times with some pretty heavy ass doses in the mix, so it's not that I just don't know what "real" psychedelic effects are like. While it obviously isn't as strong as any of those substances, weed does have those effects for me too, and I've found that weed is more likely to make me tense or anxious at high doses than LSD, shrooms, mescaline or any other psyche.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The more I think about it, the more I'm okay with the series wrapping up Gon's story and focusing on other characters. Just not quite yet.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-12 18:11:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long post incoming. TL;DR for *most of it* at the bottom. The general consensus seems to be that Gon will return to play a major part in the story again at some point... but it has also been speculated that his arc is finished and that he will not be a main focus again, which is an idea some people are on board with. For the most part, this doesn't seem to be due to a dislike of Gon's character, just a sense of completion in regards to his arc as well as a level of respect for the series to wrap up a main character's story and continue on with others. I've always felt that whatever Togashi decides to do I'll most likely be on board, but for a while I've still kind of wanted Gon to return to the spotlight again at *some point.* And to a degree I still feel that way, but lately all of this has made me realize that it could be cool to see Gon's journey as *the main character* wrap up in a sense, at least eventually. This is a rich world filled with interesting characters to follow, and if Gon's story comes to a natural conclusion I think that HxH could find new potential in carrying on with the world and other characters... which in a way has always been the focus. The thing is, I don't think Gon has finished his arc quite yet. He has accomplished what he set out to do in chapter one/episode one by finding his father and discovering why he left to be a hunter. This does wrap up his story *as we have known it* so far and makes for a great resting place for both the 2011 anime and for anyone who doesn't plan on reading the manga. And while I think it works as an ending, in the context of this story and its continuation I don't think that should be the very end of Gon's journey as a focal point in the series. One of the major themes in this tale is the idea that life goes on, people form connections and split off on their own paths, and everyone is just a small part of the grand scheme of life. This story is and always has been about the journey of these characters and of life. *Enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.* This theme makes it very appropriate to move on from Gon and focus on new characters, but it also explains why I think there should be at least a little more focus on him. Part of what makes this "enjoy the journey" motif work so well is that all of these characters have very specific paths and goals ahead of them. This world feels real and lived in because no matter who we are following, we know that the other characters are still living their lives and doing their things. Except that right now, Gon is an exception. His character is in a sort of limbo. I feel like we very well may have reached the emotional climax of his arc, but as of right now he has not only lost a major connection the major events of this story by losing his nen, but he also has no specific goals at the moment. He's kind of just sitting around at whale island not really doing anything. On the surface, it could seem like his lack of direction is a good reason his time as a main character could be concluded, but I don't think that feels right. If Hunter X Hunter really decides to wrap his story up (which it still very well may decide not to), I think we need another arc with his heavy involvement. The actual Dark Continent could be really good for this because of the specific ties to his family and ancestry that the arc may potentially have. That's not the reason he needs more time, though. I think to leave his character off on a satisfying note, he needs to find a new purpose and long-term goal. Kind of in the same way that Killua had to discover what he wanted over the course of the story so far. I think if we have him take part in one more arc in a significant way and he discovers what he wants to do with his life now that he found his father, the story could truly pull off the act of removing him from the spotlight- at least in a major way. We met him as a head strong young boy who wanted to become a hunter and discover what it means to be one, as well as find his father and learn what it meant to him. Gon became a hunter, and through his adventures he not only learned what that truly means but he also learned a lot about life itself and made some personal connections along the way. When he finally met his father, he not only learned what he had wanted to learn but Ging reaffirmed the importance of having a direction for the sake of the journey. What could potentially take Gon's arc full circle is to discover a new path to take, so that even if we aren't following him anymore we know that he's off on another adventure. The beautiful thing about Hunter X Hunter is that this massive world and unpredictable story allow for so many possibilities. I think this new turn for Gon's character should happen either way, but it would mean that future arcs could follow him on his new journeys and it could also allow his time as a main character to come to an end. If the latter were to happen, he could still play a part in certain arcs as a side character, which might be cool to see. There could be a time jump down the road, and it could be cool to see an aged and more experienced Gon from the perspective of another character. This could potentially apply to all of the "core" characters, like Killua or especially Kurapika. Kurapika has such a specific arc that just doesn't have the longevity to go on forever... once his story his completed the story could easily move on from him (not that I necessarily want him gone lol). If way down the road all four of the "mains" have wrapped up the majority of their arcs, the story could possibly rebirth itself with new focal characters. Maybe even a new series, like the jump from Dragon Ball to Dragon Ball Z. It could be really cool to see Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio take on roles similar to characters like Netero, Kite, Morel, Ging, or Silva. That's just rambling at this point, though. Who knows where this story is going, the writing works in a way that it could do all of this well or just avoid all of that (and that's under the heavy assumption that Togashi will get nearly that far with it). The main idea here is that I think with Gon's story, Hunter X Hunter has come across the possibility of doing what many shounen are unable to do- concluding a main character's story in a satisfying way while allowing the overall story to continue. And I think the best way to do that is to give the character an emotional resolution, but also a purpose for that character going forward. It not only keeps that character feeling "alive", but fits with the theme of Hunter X Hunter. It also gives the story an "ending" to the characters we've been following while possibly rebranding the face of HxH going forward. Who knows what could happen, mostly I'm just thinking out loud. **tl;dr - Gon's story in Chimera Ant and Election arcs could possibly serve as an emotional climax to his character arc, and at the least it shows that this can be achieved for our main characters. I'm on board if Togashi wants to keep Gon as a main character in the future, but if not I think it could work well too. That said, I think we need a little more in order to wrap up Gon's major story in a satisfying way. He needs a new goal after he has accomplished becoming a hunter and finding his dad. The same way Ging continuously has something he's after, Gon too needs a purpose. That way, he can go on in the background like all of the other HxH characters do whether we see him or not. This also leads to new possibilities, including time jumps and new iterations of Hunter X Hunter as we know it. While Gon is the closest to this possibility and is the main focus of this post, this could happen down the road with the other core characters as well.** **We could even get a new version of the story (like Dragon Ball to Dragon Ball Z) where the main four are far more experienced, and serve as interesting side characters to new main characters who have their own adventures and growth to accomplish.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice! I recently got into the FX show for Preacher, and just the other day I was given vol. 1 of the graphic novel as a gift. I'll be sure to start reading soon. But I know what you mean. I've convinced a handful of people to watch, myself. It's funny the different reactions I've gotten, none of which were quite like my own- though they were all positive to varying degrees. A couple have absolutely loved it, though I don't think they revere it on the level I do. One or two were pretty ambivalent on it at first, but warmed up to it a lot once the story picked up... by the time the Chimera Ant arc had finished, they definitely were ready to admit that their first impression was completely wrong lol. I had one friend who had claimed to have seen it, but was adamant that it was no different from Dragon Ball Z and could not understand what I was talking about when I kept trying to explain the way that the writing was superior (no disrespect to Dragon Ball). Then, one day he tells me "soo... I watched the first 20 episodes and thought it had ended after the first arc". Basically he hadn't seen 128 of the episodes lol. I watched the rest of it with him, and it was really funny. He never explicitly told me I had been right about everything, but I don't think he wanted to admit he had been wrong lol. It was pretty clear from his reactions that he knew it was another beast entirely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As they were explaining this new "testing" system, I had a thought. Maybe that is how it already is, and is exactly what has been happening to these characters from the start? Michael and Shawn being the architects working together to test these four humans. It could even potentially give Eleanor another "holy forking shirt balls" moment if she realizes that this is already happening. Just a random thought I had. It doesn't *seem* to be going in that direction as of the end of this last episode, but I'm not ruling it out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see Brienne going either way. With Victarion, I'm pretty sure he will not make it through TWOW for a couple reasons. He's currently an instrument in Euron's plans, which is not a safe thing to be and could easily be a death sentence. This is especially the case seeing as Victarion has it out for Euron, and Euron isn't dumb enough to be oblivious to that. He's also potential "competition" for Euron in a couple ways. Also, GRRM is clearly going to be cutting down on viewpoint characters, and Victarion is a POV character who is likely going to end up with other major POV characters, is expendable, and with the reasoning above it would make sense in the plot for him to go. I think a LOT of the viewpoint characters introduced in AFfC and ADwD are going to bite it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't let anyone hurt your buzz watching the show. Like u/xWarrickx, I also liked S7 and S8, and even a lot of people who don't will tell you that Negan is awesome. (edit- misread, seems like he just thought they were okay. I liked them, though- at least S7 for sure) Personally, I think S7 is fantastic if binged and only has minor issues. S8 is not one of my favorite seasons overall, but it honestly does have some of my favorite moments. I only jumped on TWD in the past year, and fully caught up I enjoyed every season to various degrees. Does it ever have its issues? Sure, but I've never disliked it like I have with other long running shows after a while. The main thing is just form your own opinions. Maybe you'll be one of the ones who loves where this show goes! People who suggest you just stop after a certain point are just asking you to not form your own opinion and trust theirs. It's up to you whether you like it or not, and whether you keep going or not. Either way, have fun!</TEXT>
