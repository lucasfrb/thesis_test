And there's this running joke that he's gonna shoot up the school. Just a joke. And then one time my friend sat in front of him in class and turned around and asked him "what are you drawing there?" And the dude legit was drawing an AK47 and a bunch of bodies and shit, and the creepy dude was all freaked out and yelled out "NOTHING IT'S NONE LF YOUR BUSINESS".

    <TEXT>Domino's Pizza. It may sound extremely petty, that's only because it is, but I still stand by it. I ordered pizza from them once and the guy taking my order was extremely rude, which wasn't a big deal, but he told me that the pizza will take more than an hour to be delivered to me, again; no big deal. Fifteen minutes later i call them to cancel my order, which I understand why it wouldn't be acceptable for some, but instead of telling me that it isn't possible or just accepting it, the dude started yelling at me and telling me that I am a "horrible person" and other stupid shit. Fine I told that I'm sorry about the situation but I have to cancel my order. He told me to never order from them again and that my phone number is written in their systems and that they won't allow me to order anyway. Fine. So i called a couple of days later to talk to his manager about the situation, partly because of my ego, but mainly because I like pizza, and it turns out that dude was the manager! And he started yelling at me for calling again and saying, again, that I am a horrible human being and such. Petty, but it infuriates me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't actually think you're a sick fuck. It's just the way you said that was so inconsiderate and disrespectful to the people who actually got hurt by this monster. I thought you meant that their story and horrible experiences don't matter. I now understand that's not what you meant. Didn't mean to be so harsh. But still, hoping for a gimmick or twist is not the least "sick fucky" thing to hope for now is it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a while I did some tutoring for two kids, the girl was 3rd grade and the boy 1st grade. So we were studying math, and it's the boy's turn and the girl is out somewhere with her mother, and somewhere mid lesson that kid just stood up and walked to the window (first floor), looked outside, saw his mom and sister walk through the garden gate, and then just suddenly shout to them "you daughter of a whore". What. I was losing my shit trying not to laugh by this point. So they get inside and walk into the boy's room and it turns out he was super pissed because his sister got a brand new shiny fidget spinner and he didn't. So obviously he did the rational thing and climbed on the window and started threatening to his mom that "if he doesn't get a better fidget spinner than the one his "whore of a sister" got, he'll jump out. Then the mom walked over to him to calm him down and he started cursing her out as well. He started yelling to her "don't hit me again mom!" And shit like that so I was really worried but it later occured to me that he might have just been looking for attention. This whole ordeal is fucked up though.</TEXT>

And I would even have been optimistic that we will perhaps keep playing after everyone finishes the army (it's three years here), but the guitarists has been saying for quite some time that after we finish school he will probably move on.

    <TEXT>Just in case this isn't a joke, because the idea of forcing everyone to convert is absurd, but I'll answer it as if it wasn't a terrible idea anyway, Hitler didn't care if you converted, if you were once Jewish your blood is "tainted" and you get the same fate as all the other Jewish people.

    <TEXT>I definitely see your point but I mean, why should we surrender to other people's hatred? Should we convert because people hate us? Or should people stop hating us for no reason? I don't think that it's okay to expect people to just leave what they have known for the past hundreds/thousands of years just out of fear that other people hate us just for what we believe, not even that, just what our parents or grandparents or our ancestors before that believed. I do understand where you're coming from but I think the belief that a whole religion should just convert to appease the bigots and anti-Semites is ridiculous. Edit: concert to convert...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one expects the world to conform to us. Judaism, as opposed to Islam and Christianity does not try to convert people. Nobody wants the world to conform to us, and it's not like we're some primitive people that it's such a burden to try to, and again, not conform to us, but to accept that we exist, deserve to exist, and to let us be without the need to actually erase our history to not get killed. So no, enough of the victim blaming, if you are actually suggesting what I think you are suggesting, I'll reiterate for you even though let's face it, you won't listen because you don't listen, hating Jewish people (and you won't admit that this is where it's coming from) the Holocaust was not the Jewish people's faults. And if it happens again (which it won't thanks to Israel and the IDF existing - damn i probably opened pandora's box just by mentioning these two..) it also won't be the Jewish people's faults. It's like blaming a woman for being raped just because she wouldn't adjust to some nutjob's standards and expectation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Comparing Jewish people to Hell's Angels is absurd because one is just a biker gang and one is the oldest religion. And it's not like Jewish people get harassed by police for walking down the street it also isn't like Jewish people have a history of certain crimes. (I'm not from the US so i really don't know anything about Hell's angel's and I don't want to talk outta my ass). I really doubt this conversation is going anywhere i just think that you really just don't fathom the concept of religion and what it does to the people who do not take it to the extreme, specifically Judaism imo, and because of that I doubt we will get to any common ground here. I hope you have great life, but I also hope you start accepting that you don't have all the answers and start maybe trying to listen more to people different than you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn #8217;t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said,  #8220;Oh, like you #8217;re doing now? #8221; I was taken aback, and all I could say was  #8220;Huh? #8221; but he kept cutting me off and going  #8220;huh? huh? huh? #8221; and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like  #8220;Sir, you need to pay for those first. #8221; At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually  #8220;to prevent any electrical infetterence, #8221; and then turned around and winked at me. I don #8217;t even think that #8217;s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We live in a world where it's the easiest it's ever been to prove things. Y'think it was easier to prove rape allegations 50 years ago? And also, the fact that it's hard to prove doesn't mean that we should just believe it, that's an absurd idea and it will lead to disastrous results. Obviously his rebuttal is lacking, he can only respond to the claims that have any basis, which there are 3 of if I'm not mistaken, because he cannot respond to an anonymous allegation because he doesn't know who made it! If the anonymous accusers will come forward and press charges or even just reveal who they are and it turns out to be true I will be the first one to say that he's a piece of shit and deserves to go to prison, but we're not there yet, and we live in a world that works (luckily) in a system of "innocent until proven guilty" and not the other way around.</TEXT>

And the time when Stalin died and everyone was in shock because he was considered godlike and invincible so my grandpa snuck out from home to go to his funeral when he was a young kid even though his parents forbid him from going, and he almost got trampled to death like hundreds of other people just from the sheer amount of people there.

    <TEXT>Again with the "people like you" shit. I don't have a horse in this dumb ass political discussion as I am not the one experiencing it either way and I have problems of my own and of my own country to worry about. All I did was point out that while trying to appear smart and sophisticated you are acting like a child. I don't assume anything about you and I don't know anything about you, you might be having a bad day, or maybe you're just sick of trying to make actual coherent arguments in political discussions that don't go anywhere and that has made you resort to just insulting the other side. Maybe, I don't know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright I feel like I wont change your opinion so instead of going on a rant I'll just copy paste a few stories from my mother and grandfather that lived in the USSR that I posted a few weeks ago. Two of my great-grandfathers sat in jail there just for being Jewish. Or my grandfather whose mother made homemade shoe shine and sold it for extra income because they had no money for food, and the neighbors found out and threatened to out them to the police if they don't give them their pet turtle. Which they did. And the neighbours promptly cooked and ate said turtle. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the stories my grandfather tells me about the USSR. Like the time his driving instructor got him and the rest of the driving students drunk before the lesson and then after driving drunk for an hour he had to get home by metro and appear not to be drunk or he'd get "arrested" (best case screnario- beaten) by the secret police who were everywhere just for looking intoxicated in public. And the time when Stalin died and everyone was in shock because he was considered godlike and invincible so my grandpa snuck out from home to go to his funeral when he was a young kid even though his parents forbid him from going, and he almost got trampled to death like hundreds of other people just from the sheer amount of people there. This is what happens when "Communist overlords" take over.</TEXT>

The thing is that the current consensus is that "the right is racist evil misogynistic pigs" and the left are the "progressive and enlightened", so when stuff like this happens it just proves how far away from the truth that is.

    <TEXT>When EARONS was arrested I was ecstatic. I was hoping he would be identified in my lifetime but assumed he was dead and would be identified posthumously, I was actually thinking that a few days before, and then to find out that he was identified and he is alive so he can sit in prison and face justice for his crimes? That felt good after following the case for a while and reading what absolute terror the piece of shit inflicted over his victims. I know this isn't that related as this is the Zodiac sub but this just kinda came outta me.</TEXT>

Then he says yes, they knock on the door the abuser opens, they see the dog and take it, then ask the abuser wtf is wrong with him and why would he do this and tell him that they should beat him up but choose to just take the dog and leave him to the police, the abuser imo is probably not mentally stable, he seems very distraught and just sits on the ground without saying much. I'm curious to see what his psychologic evaluation will say.</TEXT>
