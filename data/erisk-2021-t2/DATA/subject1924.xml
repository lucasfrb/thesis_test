    <DATE>2015-05-22 16:35:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So im playing this game for a long time but im sure doing something wrong i saw the Demo gameplay at IGN where you order Ratbag To Betray the Uruk Warchief. So i wonder how do i do that. In the video hi calls a meeting and you kill him with Ratbag help well i know i dont have ratbag but my Generated Minion. so i did the following thing i branded the minion i almost killed the warchief once but he escaped just like in the video and i ordered my minion to assassinate the warchief like in the video but nothing happens like that he doesent call a meeting just a duel between those 2 so i tried again the next time it wasnt a duel but in a camp he just tried to kill him with no cutsene where backstab's him just attack him like gameplay any suggestions</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just a story how i gotten better at this game trought years of playing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-05-31 17:49:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>So started playing Smite in 2012 and it was my first MOBA ever. In my first year i struggled and i went in not knowing minions do so much damage early game and i mostly died. Second year of playing i knew the basics but didnt ward and didnt watch the map well most of the year. The third year i was better and i was watching my jungler if i was solo where he is if i can help him or if i was mid was calling all mias and was rotating. And finally this year i feel im a really solid player. In every game i contribute and in every game i know certain situations when will they happen and when i rotate to save my teammate so for a new player never give up and you will get better for sure if me a noob who never played MOBA's got better to a solid player you can do it to!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-03 16:54:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i finished season 4 of vikings and i love to analyse characters I watched from the begining to see how Ragnar changes from season 1 to season 4 he is good brave unbeatable till the first siege of Paris then he just went crazy taking drugs.But still a great character.For some reason he reminded me of Ezio i dont know why but even tho they are very diffrent they are similar for me both are wise get better with age and great leaders,but unlike Ragnar when everything goes downhill for Ezio he stays calm and uses wisdom to overcome everything.What do you think is Ezio the best Character. P.S. Edward is my second choice Haytham close third</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-19 20:03:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i'm in the 4th grade of high school so this year its my last year in it.Last year a new girl moved in to our town and moved to our class.She is really beatifull and i kinda liked her from the get go.Me and my friend were talking about her and i said i like her and he also said he liked her.We talked and said that if she likes the other one we were okay with that but im confused i was in the 3rd grade chubby and about 175cm (5'9 for you American folks)and she always said hi and hugged me (pretty sure i was adorable for her not in a romantic way but a he looks like a teddybear kinda deal)and my friend always talked with her and they are good friends too.This year i said i would change my ways of living and i started working out eating healthy lost 15 kg during the summer break and grew to 185(6ft1)(mainly because of her).So we started school again and she seems friendly but she doesnt talk to me like she used to and i feel kinda sad (thinking about getting fat again)but she still talks with my friend and he is skinny and 6'3 didnt change much so maybe its not about that i changed.Didnt do any mean thing that i know of i always say hi and give some compliments (you are looking pretty today,i like your (Shirt-T-shirt etc)) so im confused right now what happend she seemed to like me maybe not like a guy but as a friend.Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When i was little (about 11) i got angry at my grandpa and got outside of the house. He was 92 and couldnt walk anymore but he went outside the house with his stick in his right hand and just stood there. He didnt walk for years before that. I was a little asshole the whole time and was just watching him with anger and was just sitting on the grass. He watched over me for 2 hours without going back to the house to rest. After 2 hours i saw he was trembling and shakeing so i went inside the house and he hugged me and we ate some pancakes. He passed away in 2013 almost being a 100 years old. Fought in the Second world war and was one of my biggest heroes. Ever since he died i cant stop thinking how i a bratty little bastard made an old man of 90+ years stand in the sun. Cant even remember what i was angry about. So there is my memory a sad but at the same time a happy one.</TEXT>

After some time my grandpa exited the house with his stick in his right hand and just stood there and watched over me. I was so angry that i didnt care and let him stand 2+ hours in the hot summer sun. I went inside and he hugged me and we ate pancakes. He died in 2013 at almost a 100 years old. till this day i regret my actions and always hated myslef for doing that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>James Braddock also known as the Cinderella Man. He was a boxer but sustained a hand injury which forced him to retire. Without a job during the great depression he worked manual labour for a minimun wage. He got another chance for the tittle when he faced the champ Max Baer and defeated him with his injured hand. His life is greatly depicted in the 2005 movie Cinderella Man which stars Russell Crowe. Its a great story about a father who would do anything for his children and his beloved once. There is a scene (dont know if it actually happened) where Braddock gives him lunch to his daughter saying that he dreamed about food last night and that he was full letting his daughter eat more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was only 16. Never had a crush before so this new feeling was very weird. Didnt even know i had i crush until she hugged me one day and my heart and stomach just exploded. So i hid it from my parents and didnt tell anyone. As a 16 year old boy you got to imagine i didnt know what to do really. One day i had a great idea to write an old fashioned letter and give it to her, but i found it would be a weird thing to do to just give her a letter at random so i had drawn her (it was a really good portrait) for her birthday and gave her the drawing and a letter in a box. Next day she just ghosted me all day and i guessed she read the letter. Well not only did she read the letter but her best friend who spread the content to the whole school. Everybody laughed at me and i really was crushed. But some girl came to me and said it was a nice gesture and some dudes told me i had balls to do that ( She was literally the most beautiful girl in the school, school had a vote on it) 2 years later we became good friends and she even asked me on a date. After a couple of dates i just said we should stay friends because to be honest i didnt like her that much as peson once i really got to know her. So all is well that ends well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend told me about warframe and wanted me to start so we can play together when he gets back from his holiday so until then i wanted to lvl up and get good at the game. Struggled at the begining but got a little bit better as the time went on. I finally had enough credits to get a warframe suited for my playstyle (Support,tank) so i bought the Rhino blueprint. Now i didnt know where the components were being dropped so i went to the chat and asked if somebody just knew the locations and there goes my hero. A guy pm-ed me literally immediately and told me to party up. Dude was waaaaay ahead of me in terms of lvl and skill. He just went and killed the Jackal like 50 times to get me those parts. At the end i only didnt get the system part because my game went to a black screen every now and then so i didnt want to bother him. Just wanted to to say that the community is really great and the game is fantastic!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was years ago in a video game. I found a website where you can trade accounts if someone else had something that you liked and you didnt have. So me and a guy saw each others profiles we had almost indentical stuff but he had a skin that i liked and i had one that he liked. Those skins are not avaliable anymore so we agreed to trade with each other. He didnt verify his account with his email so i didnt want to trade with him but he begged and begged even called me so i said sure and wanted him to promise me he will not steal the profile. So we switched and i played on the new one but 2 days later the account had changed its name and password. I called him and he laughed at me and called me an idiot and a retard. Being that he was a 12 year old kid and i knew where he lived i felt bad and didnt want to do nothing. But one day i thought if he is doing that when he is 12 years old what will he do when he is older so i went to his house where he lived with his gradma and told her everything (Had to explain alot of things) His gradma was pissed and offered me my account back and his (well she didnt know about games that well but she figured that would suffice) and grounded him for a very long time. I rejected it and left my account to him and said he can enjoy it. The kid actually started crying at the end so i felt bad but knew i did the right thing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>recently bought the game on a discount and started to play again. Can anyone tell me why every player guards you and steals every single ball and my teammates just foul everybody even tough i dont want them to. (Reach in fouls not shooting fouls) And how do you shot in this game, last game i played was 2k16 and it was clear. Hit the meter in the middle the closer you are the better then shot and it worked. This year i hit the most upper part of the shot every time and it just bricks. Open shots i cant get them to fall in. Read somewhere that the most upper part of the meter is counted as late which i find very stupid and you need to hit like about 80% up the meter. Im playing MyGM not online just offline play and the CPU is just cheating. I played at Hall of fame difficulty for years now at pro lvl i cant win because they shot 70% and i cant even shot 35% Edit: Also i cant get past nobody even with Kyrie. If Dirk defended me and im Kyrie fuck it Dirk is the new Kawhi Leonard</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it. Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three." - Ezio Auditore Really sticked with me because its true. When you are young you dont notice stuff that is important but as time passes you understand the world more and more.  #8220;Where tree leaves dance... one shall find flames... the fire's shadow will illuminate the village... and once again tree leaves shall bud anew. #8221; - Sarutobi Hiruzen The Third Hokage This is also one of my favourite quotes. Also about time and changes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well for me it was a video game, Assassins Creed 2 So when i first played it when it came out i was a young stupid teenager and liked it because you get to play as a badass killer who can take on everybody and and anybody, but as the time passed on and the Ezio Series continued and i got older every sentence that the historical figures say and Ezios many godly speeches i learned a lot from a fictional but for me a very real person. Then a short animated episode came out years later and from his final words i got my favourite quote "When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it." For me i learned from this sentence alone that dont waste your time and regret it later, if i say today i dont have time to do that thing i liked thats bullshit and this quote reminds me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not gonna speak for everybody but i liked ME2 better then ME3 not just because of the ending but the overall experience. It should feel more linear and constricted then ME3 because in ME2 you are exploring the Terminus System while in ME3 you are rushing across the whole galaxy but for me atleast it feels so much bigger. Omega is also really cool. You are working the underground with a crew that consists of a whole range of characters. In ME2 not a signle character felt missused or flat atleast for me. You get to meet alot of them for the first time and bond with them and if they die you really feel sad, their Loyality missions were great also, and dont get me started on the suicide mission because when i first played it i felt like i was on the edge of my seat the whole time not knowing will all of them survive. When i first played ME2 i screwed up and didnt upgrade the Normandy to the fullest and Garrus and freaking Grunt died i didnt play the game for the next week just because i was furious with myself. ME3 like i said felt little to linear for me even tough you are exploring the whole galaxy, the crew even tough smaller felt also great because there were the fan favourites and Garrus went on calibrating like usual, also the DLC was the best. The Ending did screw up the experience (damn leaking of the real ending screwed us all) but at the end of the day ME2 did better in my eyes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>pretty sure that is the way the game is optimized when you are zoomed out the details are lowered so the game can handle a lot of units at the same time, in rome 2 i remember there was an option if there was a huge number of units on the field that the settings would go down depending on the size of the battle. Pretty sure the LOD settings is for better looking units when zoomed out but now quite sure dont quote me on that one</TEXT>

    <TEXT>for the first run just use Better maps and the one that if you dont have a general in the army and a samurai is the leader it uses his model and not the yari ashigaru one, also better water. Just the small visuals that makes the game more realistic. And if you are a history buff there are also mods that change how the generals looked for example Shingen had his famous armor and in the vanilla he has a standard armor</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well my friend there is your problem, 3K is character based. For example when you get Zhang Liao you get hyped because he was a badass but if you dont know him you are like meh i got a sentinel. Read up on it a little then you will get into it. Just like i didnt like Warhammer then i read a little bit now im a total Warhammer fan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An Aasimar. A human woman had a tiefling lover and she found out that she was pregnant. Terrified that she will have a tiefling baby she prayed to her god that the baby would be normal. She gave birth to twins, one is an aasimar and one a tiefling. Not wanting the whole village to hate her she sells her son tiefling to some smugglers and bandits and keeps the other son (the Aasimar) The Aasimar becomes a great fighter and must wear a mask because he is to beautiful and angelic (High Charisma so i had to make a lore thing) while the Tiefling is being trained to become a great martial artist in an evil-ish monastery by his Monk Mentor. Ofcourse the Aasimar goes on an adventure to find his brother</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me and my friends started playing D amp;D not so long ago and our friend who is playing it more than us, a couple of months more was teaching us about the game. So he told us that we roll a D20 and stack the STR mod on top of it, if its higher than the enemies AC you hit, then you roll your weapond dice and what you get thats your damage but i read somewhere that if you have proficiency with weapons you do (d20 STR mod and Prof) for the roll and for the damage you go the weapon dice+ STR mod as bonus damage?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Currently playing a conquest paladin dragonborn, who dndnext helped me with so thank you. If he dies (hopefuly not) i was thinking of a tiefling who was a devil lord of some sorts, not the archdevils ofcourse thats to powerful for characters but some sorts of a higher position. So i thought he messed up and Asmodeus took his powers and sent him to some kind of "Prove me that you are still a worthy asset kind of journey" so what do you thinks its the best build for that kind of character</TEXT>

I already asked my friend if i can do a character like this and he said sure no problem. Im not planning for him to be op or anything just a little backstory to make him interesting. My DM told me if he lives to lvl 20 and i want to retire him he will make him into an npc with real powers like his mission was a sucess. I like that idea about flavoring pact magic like my old power. One question if im doing this as a backstory my guy would probably be Lawful evil right?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why Drew Mcintyre made me watch wrestling again</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-13 11:47:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Started watching wrestling when i was a kid in 1998 and i fell in love with it instantly. Was to young to remember most of the attitude era, but fortunately Ruthless Agression era was just around the corner and even tho some of the angles were wacky and weird most of it was serious rivalries and superhero fighting i loved. The wrestlers felt like real badasses. As i grew older and WWE went full on PG it kinda felt like watching a program for children (nothing wrong with that) but it just felt weird. So to my suprise i turned to watching NXT a couple of years ago and enjoyed it more then the main shows, especially the new Drew Mcintyre. He just seems like those old superstars like Austin, The Rock, Triple H (even if he burried everyone he was great) and even John Cena. Something about the dude just screams main event. Even when he wrestlers every kick punch CLAYMORE feels like a real hit. Hope he wins the tittle at Wrestlemania (if it doesnt get cancelled) and please let him enter wrestlemania with broken dreams :D</TEXT>

And i go Glaive flavoured to a heavy bo staff for the reach. Rune knight is for the Giants Might ability plus the runes that give me basically rage and the fire chains flavoure into his freezing ability at low lvls. Other than that everything else is the same. Thinking of getting still the unarmed fighting style when i want to fight with my fist. What do i get instead of tavern brawler if i go this route?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST] [STEAM] [Three Kingdoms] (PC)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-22 20:54:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello my name is Luka and iam from a small country called Montenegro. Hello my reddit friends. Since the outbreak of the corona virus everybody is sitting at home, my situation is the same. For a couple of days i have been trying to do something to cure my boredom but after a while i couldnt find anything more to do. I have been a big fan of Total war games since i was a little boy, when my father bought Medieval 2 i was the happiest kid alive. The new total war game, Three Kingdoms has been released a year ago and i have been hopeing to play. But living in a poor country and being a med student doesnt allow me some comforts. I have been saving for it and hopeing i could get it on a sale or something but every time i save up something happens that is more important than my gaming experience. My dad getting sick and injured, My dog needing his medicine, not going out with my friends for a couple of months.... Now i almost saved up for it but i had to pay my monthly bus ticket because my college isnt in my city so i have to travel to it every day. When we got quarantied because of the virus i was hopeing the bus company would refund my money because i only used it 2 days out of 31, but alas the company said that they cant do anything about it and it was just bad luck. I have been a fan of the three kingdoms period since i was a little boy and read the book which was my favourite (until i read Lord Of The Rings). I know i shouldnt be begging other people for something that i could earn and im not hopeing for anything but im shooting my shot over here anyways Thanks for anyone reading this and sorry for so many grammatical mistakes. English is not my first language [https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>btw i forgot to ask, with warlock because your slots levels with you, for example if i multiclass into a paladin and i use a slot for divine smite does that mean that my divine smite is the level of my slot? or any other ability that scales. I read the invocation Eldritch Smite at it says when i expand a slot i get 1d8 damage so does that mean if i expand a lvl 5 slot i get 5d8? or its just one slot for 1d8. If that is so then it is pretty weak</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How would you roleplay an old exiled Triton?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-15 12:19:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my story is that he is from one of the noble houses in the ocean who are born to protect the ocean from the monsters coming in from the portals. He has a sister known for her beauty even outside the water. She is chosen by the Triton god persana to be the champion of the tritons. One day a wizard with his men attack the triton so they can capture her, and they did. But she was fighting back so the wizard not wanting to get outdone by her locks her into a magic prison where she falls asleep. So my character (her older brother) wants to pursue them but the Triton houses say that he musnt follow them or they will Exile him. He goes to Persana and she gives him the power of a vengance paladn (Lore reason for a paladin character) and he finds the wizard kills him but before that he tells him that there is a magic Trident that could break the spell but he doesnt know where it is only that is not in the ocean but on land. So years passed he wandered the earth to find the trident so he can rescue her sister. Thats the backstory so how would i roleplay an old exiled triton on land Here are my rolled stats STR 18 Dex 9 ( i put 9 in Dex because he is from the water so he wouldnt be used to the land) Con 14 Wis 10 Int 10 Char 19</TEXT>

So i was thinking that he would be great at the negotiatons because he was born of a higher status,but also people woudnt like him because they are not aware of the tritons and their culture.

    <TEXT>[PC] Total War Three Kingdoms. Wish i could post a video but im in a cramped space and my accent is to strong so i think a message will be better for understanding. Why do i want it? I always loved the 3K era and history as a whole. Played almost all the total war games and waited for the 3k era for a long time. Why cant i afford it myself? Sadly cant afford it because where im from the full price, even on a 50 percent discount is a one third of my parents paycheck so still waiting on a massive discount. I started college also so alot of money is going for bus tickets because my university is really far awat from where i am. Why not play some other games? I played alsmot all of them alot of times even tough i love them after 10th time it gets boring. To play as the great Liu bei, lu bu and Sun Ce would also wake my inner childhood because Dynast warriors  #128513;. Cant say that all is not good got a free DLC code for 3K a couple of months back from a friend and everyone is ok health wise. Good luck to everyone and stay safe. Thanks for the giveaway you are gonna make so many peoples days. https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93/</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Personal Arc For a PC</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-19 13:11:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>This will be my first campaign as a DM and i set it in Eberron. Its still an official campaign but i can homebrew it a little bit so thats why i choose it. So my PC made a Dr Strange character type, a occult Wizard who studies the ways of the arcane and travels around Eberron for studying local magic. He has a daughter and a wife but he is so busy with his work that his wife leaves him and he sometimes visits his daughter which he has a rocky relationship with. So me and my PC thought that maybe for his arc his daughter gets kiddnaped so they can get a little bit closer. What do you think about this and how should i do it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A small Arc in my story</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 19:56:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Im makeing an eberron campaign and my players want to be some kind of detectives. So i thought that they are hired to find missing people from a village. They do but one boy dies and only him when they rescue the villagers. They come back to the village happy that everyone survived (well almost). A man asks them where is his little boy and they realise that he is the father of the child who died. He cries tells them that its their fault for being to damn slow (nothing to loud for makeing a scene but just enoguh so they will remember it). After some time they will return to the village to see the Kings Men securing the area. They see that every single villager has died. So they investigate. Its the father of the boy and he keeps haunting the party for the next several missions. What do you think of this, any suggestions would be great, also one of my players has a daughter so maybe the guy kidnaps her?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Witcher 3 if possible :) Well im a secluded person to begin with so the quarantine didnt change my lifestyle really. But i did get to spend a little more time with my family then usual so that was nice. The first thing after the quarantine ends is that im going to visit my dog that passed away 3 years ago. My father never told us where he burried her, but a couple of days ago he told us. So im planning just to go and sit near it and kinda talk to her (i know she was a dog and yes i know she is dead) but i feel like it will help me a little bit. Sorry for a depressing story.

I have about 90-140 mbps depends of the time of the day. Sometimes the resolution gets scaled down butbgets back to normal real quick. Tried Apex Legends just to see how much does it effect ngl it ran actually pretty good. Didnt feel like im lagging but iam a really casual online player so i cant speak about it that much.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Rise Of The Tomb Raider (2016)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 14:00:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>About myslef. Hello GoG long time follower of this subreddit, huge fan of this subreddit because of the give and recive attitude. A 22 year old student, long time gamer (first game i played was Gothic) coming from the Balkans. Today im trying to get a game that i wanted to play for a long time just couldnt get it for various reasons and trying to shoot my shot. Because of GoG i finally got to play my most wanted game ever The Witcher 3 (thanks Harry you are still the best). Hope all of you who are reading this have a nice day and stay safe. What is Rise Of The Tomb Raide? Its a 2016 game that is a direct sequel to the award winning reboot of the Tom Raider franchise in 2013. It first launched on Xbox in 2015 but after a year it was released on the PC too. It is an open world survival/horor/action game. Why i want the game? Finished the first game back when it was released and loved the new soft reboot of the franchise. As a big Tomb Raider fan growing up (Thanks Angelina Jolie) it hit all the right tunes. Moving away from the clunky gameplay of the old games and that weird camera (still all awesome games especially when i was younger) it follows a younger less experienced Lara and her first adventures. Always wanted to play it, back in 2016 it was to much for my old laptop so had to wait untill i got something better to play on. Why i cant get it myself? Just short on money this last couple of months, its getting better i hope. Its 29.99 #8364; on steam but on instant-gaming.com its 12 #8364; Many people told me that this site is legit, dont know from experience tho.in [https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93](https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Rise Of The Tomb Raider (2016) 7.49 euros</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 17:10:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>About myslef. Hello GoG long time follower of this subreddit, huge fan of this subreddit because of the give and recive attitude. Wrote this request a few days ago but a fellow redditor remided me that steam sale is in a couple of days so here i am again. A 22 year old student, long time gamer (first game i played was Gothic) coming from the Balkans. Today im trying to get a game that i wanted to play for a long time just couldnt get it for various reasons and trying to shoot my shot. Because of GoG i finally got to play my most wanted game ever The Witcher 3 (thanks Harry you are still the best). Hope all of you who are reading this have a nice day and stay safe. What is Rise Of The Tomb Raide? Its a 2016 game that is a direct sequel to the award winning reboot of the Tom Raider franchise in 2013. It first launched on Xbox in 2015 but after a year it was released on the PC too. It is an open world survival/horor/action game. Why i want the game? Finished the first game back when it was released and loved the new soft reboot of the franchise. As a big Tomb Raider fan growing up (Thanks Angelina Jolie) it hit all the right tunes. Moving away from the clunky gameplay of the old games and that weird camera (still all awesome games especially when i was younger) it follows a younger less experienced Lara and her first adventures. Always wanted to play it, back in 2016 it was to much for my old laptop so had to wait untill i got something better to play on. Why i cant get it myself? Just short on money this last couple of months, its getting better i hope. Its 7.49 euros on STEAM right now. Thanks for reading.

    <TEXT>Just finished my first ever playtrough (best 100hrs of my life) and decided to play a second one on death march. Any way to upgrade default armour? Played the first game with School of the wolf now i wanted some new armour but every other witcher gear kinda looks bad. Ursine is fine i guess and cat is decent but the default one looks badass. Cant unfortunately use mods and console because im playing with Geforce now. I know there is also viper armour but you cant get it untill very late game. Only other armour that i like is the temerian one but its get overleveled quickly.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Rise Of The Tomb Raider (2016) 7.49 #8364;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-29 21:14:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>About myself. * Hello GoG long time follower of this subreddit, huge fan of this subreddit because of the give and recive attitude. Wrote this request a few days ago but a fellow redditor remided me that steam sale is in a couple of days so here i am again. A 22 year old student, long time gamer (first game i played was Gothic) coming from the Balkans. Today im trying to get a game that i wanted to play for a long time just couldnt get it for various reasons and trying to shoot my shot. Because of GoG i finally got to play my most wanted game ever The Witcher 3 (thanks Harry you are still the best). Hope all of you who are reading this have a nice day and stay safe. * **What is Rise Of The Tomb Raide?** Its a 2016 game that is a direct sequel to the award winning reboot of the Tom Raider franchise in 2013. It first launched on Xbox in 2015 but after a year it was released on the PC too. It is an open world survival/horor/action game. * **Why i want the game?** Finished the first game back when it was released and loved the new soft reboot of the franchise. As a big Tomb Raider fan growing up (Thanks Angelina Jolie) it hit all the right tunes. Moving away from the clunky gameplay of the old games and that weird camera (still all awesome games especially when i was younger) it follows a younger less experienced Lara and her first adventures. Always wanted to play it, back in 2016 it was to much for my old laptop so had to wait untill i got something better to play on. * **Why i cant get it myself?** Just short on money this last couple of months, its getting better i hope. [Rise Of The Tomb Raider STEAM page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391220/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider/)  #8203; Thanks for reading.

He does struggle a bit with social encounters not because he is shy but more because he doesnt care that much and because its fantasy why couldnt a specter/wraith creature have a love interest/sexual partner so i agree with you 100%</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Assassin's Creed Origins [2017][80% Off]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-03 00:16:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Introduction** Hello GoG, my name is Luka and im 22 years old currently studying to become a dentist and i come from a small country in the balkans. Long time follower of this subreddit, always liked the give and recive attitude and ofcourse the whole community for being so wholesome **What game do i request?** Im requesting Assassin's Creed Origins **What is Assassin's Creed Origins?** Its the 9th game in the Assassin's Creed franchise which is most famous for its breathtaking renders of real life places, like medieval middle east, renaissance (not gonna lie had to spell check this word) Italy, Istanbul, Colonial America, The Caribbean Sea, Paris in the midst of a revolution, London and finally Egypt in Assassin's Creed Origins. It follows Bayek one of the first assassins in the order and it explores how the brotherhood started. Its a little bit different from the rest of the games because it has a lot more of RPG elements and resembles more The Witcher 3 then the games before in the series. Of course there are many recognizables characters from real life history like cleopatra and Julius Caesar. **Why i want the game?** I want the game because ever since i was little AC had a special place in my heart and belive it or not i beat Assassin's Creed II in a day when it released, still my personal best when it comes to speed runs even tho i didnt play it like that. I beat everyone of them up untill Origins. I didnt have a good rig to play the latest ones but a month ago i found out about cloud gaming and got into Geforce NOW (seriously if you dont have a good rig, try it its a godsend) so i completed Unity and Syndicate which i wanted to play for the longest time so that was a dream come true. **Why i cant afford the game?** Well needless to say its because of the current situation in the world, where i live it actually became a lot better and we actually had 0 cases after about 2 months of quarantine. We reopened but in just 6 days almost 400 cases were discovered and lockdown is pretty certain again. Even without COVID-19 its exams season and to even take them you must pay and i have quite a bit of them (Sorry mom!) so im a little bit short on money at the moment.

    <TEXT>Hellblade Senuas sacrifice https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93 Thanks for the giveaway op. Here you go a funny story that happened to me So im waiting for the bus and a girl is going my way, you know when someone speeds up a couple of meters infront of you when they recognize you to hug you? So yeah she speeds up and im kinda blind when its night so i didnt see her face that well that night and i thought i knew her. I go in for the hug and the girl is mortified. So in a split second i come up with a lie that im her cousin and we hang out when we were younger. Till this day she says hi every time and thinks we are related.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you think about my characters backstory and story progress</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-06 16:12:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>So im writting a short story, its about the sun has become to hot for planet earth its in the near future 2100s. Volunteers are stepping up for a big project that could probably save Earth. One of the character is a bounty hunter in the lowest levels of the biggest city in the world (No more nations humanity as a whole have one goverment). He only kills those he deems worthy to be killed. He gets a new bounty but for the first time in his career he boches his job and kills a father of a poor low income family. So to make amends he joins the project and all money he gets he gives the family. The mother knows about this but she has no choice but to take the money even though she hates him. So at the end of the story (almost the end) he does something heroic and the whole world sees it. So they make a heroes welcome and as he is walking down the aisle he sees the woman, he is thinking to himself that he can pay a large amount of money to her now because he got a bonus. He approaches her but she stabs him, he is shocked but he understands at some level. She stabs him because the man who killed her husband has been pronounced as the hero of the world while her husband has been forgotten like he never existed. I dont know how to finish it, maybe he survives or better to let him die. Must conteplate on the ending. Thanks for reading, give me your thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He mistook him for his bounty. Forgot this part sorry. The bounty hunter had a bad couple of days. So this job he didnt really focus on it and shoot him at first sight. He looked decently similar, after he killed him he heard his kid call out for his father. The bounty hunter knew that the target had no family so he was shocked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks a lot! I was going for that kind of effect  #128578;. If you end up liking the bounty hunter you can also understand the mother. I have six regular characters, 2 that you could consider main characters but they are a little bit cliche/tropee, which im trying to change. I find the side characters are much easier and more interesting to write haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello OP thanks for the giveaway. Fun trivia: In AC 2 the database says that Altair could swim but the animus 1.0 had a bug so every time altair jumps into the water the sync would break. (Totally intentional  #129323;) Greatest achivment: Funnily enough you mentioned GUN because my greatest achivment was me beating i think his name was Mcallister (the one who stole your fathers riffle) when i was 7 when my brothers could not do it. Yes i can run it. Best of luck to all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello OP thans for the giveaway. Fun fact: In AC II in the database it says that altair coulf not swim because the Animus had a "bug" (sure ubisoft we belive it) Greatest achivment: Funnily enough its from the game GUN. Ikilled Mcallister (i think that was his name, the dude who steals your fathers rifle) when i was 7 when my brothers could not beat him. Why i want the game? Because im a huge western movie lover. Bud Spencer is my favourite cowboy actor. And because Arthur is really a good character maybe top 3 in my book. I can run it. Good luck to everyone. https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yean sure. Its just my opinion tho. For me number 1 is Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Mostly because AC 2 came out when i was just a teenager and honestly i have learned a lot from him. Also helps that he has 3 games where you see him from birth to death He lost everything but never surrendered, even tough this life he didnt choose it he never complained about and made the best of every situation. At the end he truly became a Mentor to every Assassin and is definetaly set the standard. The last scene where he meets altair and desmond and finds out that his whole life was just so Desmond can improve and he was just another life in the grand schemes, no heroes welcome no celebrations for him just the satisfaction that he did his part however small it may be. Close second is Big Boss (Snake eater version). He could have been first but i didnt play it at release i only beat it like 6 years ago after Ezio so i could not get the same enjoyment i guess. Just my opinion tho. Arthur is definetaly a better written character just the nostalgic feeling and my developing years are a big factor  #128513;. Sorry for the long post i get inspiried when someone talks games with me. Edit OMG i forgot commander Shepard dudee. Snake is 3 Shep is 2</TEXT>

Because i always had a fascination with the universe so a game that lets you explore the milky way and has some cool ass aliens i said hell yeah. Plus you have the best character ever created my man Garrus. Him and Shep have the best friendship that we all should strive to have, minus the saving the galaxy part.

    <TEXT>* **Intro (About Myself)** Hello guys my name is Luka, currently a student. Long time follower of this subreddit. As always my opinion is that this subreddit is really nice and helpful. Met the most kindest people here and always love talking about games with everyone. * **What Game Am I Requesting?** Rise Of The Tomb Raider, it is the sequal of the first game that came out in 2013 which a soft reboot of the original games. The first game followed Lara on her first major journey where she learned all the necessary skills to survive and explore various Tombs. * **Why cant i afford the game?** Living in a country with the smallest wages in the world is always tough and being a student with only a part time job doesnt help. Recently my dad lost his job so all the money we are making is going to electrical bills and other necessties. Wanted to play the game for so long but never had money for a gaming computer or the game itself. Recently i found about Streaming services that are really cheap so im trying to play the games that i could not when they released.

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Total War Three Kingdoms (33% off)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-11 15:38:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>* **Intro** Hello GoG today im trying to request Total War Three Kingdoms which is on sale. Im not usually comfortable for asking for really expensive games but the game is rarely on sale ever since it released so i figured it wont hurt to ask. * **What is Total War Three Kingdoms?** Total War Three Kingdoms is part of the Total War series that is ongoing since 1990s with their first release being shogun. This time around the Total War takes you to China in the Three Kingdoms period. For those not familiar with that period, it takes place in the period of 190 to 250 AD in China where after the fall of Han Empire three new Empires rose to fight each other and unite China under one banner again. The game is heavily inspired by the Three Kingdom romance novel which brings a mix of fantasy and history to the game. * **Why Do I Want The Game?** Ever since i was little i was a big fan of the Koei franchises Dynasty Warriors and the strategy game Romance of the Three Kigndoms. So when i learned that one of my favourite franchises (total war) is making a Three Kingdoms game i was beyond exited. Knowing that you could lead the most prominent generals of that era (Cao Cao, Liu Bei and The Sun Clan) and change history in the sandbox style of total war was awesome. Watching the official streams for months and seeing the portraits of the characters that were larger than life was just bringing the excitement to another level. The diplomacy was reworked, the new retinue system, the big map of China and the hint of Korea was just adding even more hype. * **Why Cant I Get The Game Myself?** Where i live game prices are really expensive because of the average wage being one of the lowest in Europe so buying video game is pretty much a luxury.Ever since it released i was trying to save up atleast to half of its price and wait for a sale but always something came up more urgent so it never worked out. Im a 4th year Medical Student and worked part time as a waiter in a local pub untill corona hit and i got released because i was only part time. Now im waiting for an internship when schools open again. My dad also lost his long time job, but found a small job near the city and is starting to work again soon, so that is some good news. The Game [https://store.steampowered.com/app/779340/Total\_War\_THREE\_KINGDOMS/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/779340/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS/) My profile: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93/) * **Closing Words.** Thanks to everyone who is reading this. Because im a big fan of the game i watch daily streams of it and got 2 DLC keys back in january, i already gave one away on GoG and kept one in the case i saved up for the game. I dont know if DLC keys have a timer or expiring date so if i dont get the game soon im willing to giveaway the key (its the Mandate Of Heaven DLC) to anyone who is interested and not risk it wasting away. Thanks again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Elrond. Just straight up wise a great warrior and also helps that Hugo Weaving played him in the live adaptation! He is one of the rare people who belived in the strenght of the Hobbits and didnt see them as inferior just because they were small. For all his perfections his flaws made him my favourite. Even though he blaimed the race of men and Isildur for the rise of Sauron he always belived in Aragorn that he can change everything. Atleast thats my opinion! Just for straight up laughter and entertainment Gimli takes the cake.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would love the A World Betrayed DLC for Total War THREE KINGDOMS. Its 9.99$ so its not to much expensive but still out of my range. Huge Three Kingdoms fan. I got gifted the game 15 days ago after a year and a half of watching daily videos and updates. I got to 135hrs of playing time in that time (you could say im addicted). I would like to get it because it unlocks the best faction and starting date in my opinion (Lu Bu) (Do not chase Lu Buu!) https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93 EU region. P.S. im totally fine not getting it btw. I got the base game gifted 15 days ago and some people didnt get gifted anything. Just wrote it for the chance. Good Luck to All.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh wow back at it again. I would like the A World betrayed DLC for total war three Kingdoms. Was hyped for the game when it was first announced back in january of 2018 and of course a big Dynasty Warrior fan back in the ps2 era. So one of my favourite eras in history (and as a novel) merges with my favourite video game of all time? Hell yes! Just recently got it from GoG after watching videos and updates for a year and it didnt dissapoint. One of the best games i have played in my life. And with the DLCs its the same story. Masterfuly done (except for the first one, live and learn) The A World Betrayed DLC especially because it is set in the true begining of that period. Every major player has been introduced and the war pieces have been moved. Also introduces two of the best factions in the game and one being my favourite (Lu Bu 194 start). Why is he my favourite? Because he is Lu Bu, warrior without equal. I dont know how much you know about the Three Kingdoms era but in real life even tough he was a truly badass warrior he lost early on in the conflict but that is the charm of the Total War games. You get to rewrite history. The other major faction is also dear to my heart because they are basically the Starks of China. Sun Jian (the father) gets killed, one of the rare honorable people in that period. And now it is up to his son Sun Ce to avenge his father and build a better future for his younger brother and sister. He was called the little conqurer because by the year of 200 he conqured almost all of south China with his charisma and loyal friend and family members. Its not just these two factions, every major faction from the base game returns with more characters and more land, and some with new revamped mechanichs. The DLC is 9.99 #8364; on STEAM there is cheaper ones on other sites, dont know how trustworthy they are tough. Im EU region STEAM: https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93 thanks for another opportunity to you and XYZgiveaways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last two rounds i was asking for a World Betrayed DLC for Three Kingdoms, and i realised it might be to greedy because its taking up 1/6 of the budget so in this round im requesting the Blood Pack DLC for Three Kingdoms https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/874310/ (Dont know how to talk in links on mobile sorry) its 2.99 #8364; on STEAM Its a graphical DLC that puts blood,new animations/executions to the battlefield and on the campaign map aswell. It is a shame that its a DLC because in the previous older tittles like medieval 2 total war it was in the base game as a graphic option. Many speculate that its a DLC nowadays because it keeps the rating of the game below Rated M. But they did upgrade the system with many new moves and realistic blood splatter (i swear im not a psychopath lol) it great for immersion. The game is called Total War so blood would be expected, especially in ancient china where almost 30% of population died in a span of 20 years. Thanks for all these giveaways. Yake a break after this one or you all gonna go bankrupt  #128578; EU region https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow dude round 4? Thanks a bunch for all these opportunities. Im requesting for The Blood And Reign DLC for Total War Three Kingdoms, its 2.99 #8364; on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/874310/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS__Reign_of_Blood/ Why am i asking for this DLC? Its a graphical DLC that adds blood particles, various animation and executions on the battle map and on the campaign map. Even adds special animations to specific generals that are exclusive to them and their style of fighting. In the older tittles like Total War Medieval 2 (The GOAT of all total war games) it was a free graphical option, but after medieval Creative Assembly decided to disable it and make it a DLC. there is a lot of theories on why they made this decision, the only one that make sense is so they could lower the rating of the game and not be labelled as Mature or Rated M. Unlike previous Blood DLCs this one for Three Kingdoms is actually pretty good. You can adjust the amount of particles, the splatter and the previous mentioned animations and executions. What is a Total War game without some backstabing allies, vassals and blood! (Like i said in the previous entry, im not a psycho i swear  #129315;) Why cant i get it myself? My credit card is in a minus so to get it i would have to pay the minus plus the amount for maintenance and the amount for the DLC. Unfortunately i dont have that amount of money on me right now.

Best strategy/massive battles games The newest major tittle, Total War Three Kingdoms is probably the best in the series with its by faaaaar better diplomacy then in the previous tittles. Many enjoy Warhammer if you are into fantasy. Other games that im saving for are the tomb raider games, the newer 2013 reboot versions (even tho i love the older ones too.) The 2013 version was free a couple of months ago so was blessed to play it. Real improvment on the older tittles and the actress that potrays Lara now is really good!

    <DATE>2020-10-14 12:25:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello GoG, i hope you are all doing very well. Today im going to request the A World Betrayed DLC for the game Total War Three Kingdoms. A World Betrayed is the second chapter pack for Three Kingdoms. Same as the Mandate Of Heaven DLC it changes the starting year for every faction and adds a couple of new playable factions and mechanics. The starting year for this DLC is 194, 4 years after the base game and 16 years after The Mandate Of Heaven. The new playable factions, Lu Bu and Sun Ce are the main focus of this DLC. At this point both of them started their own factions and conquest. Lu Bu got a new faction mechanic that is like a hitman list. He has over 30 names on his list and must defeat them so he can prove that he indeed is the warrior without equal. Sun Ce has also got a faction mechanic but unlike Lu Bu where its all about him, his faction mechanic is about family and his friends. His goal is to retake his home and avenge his father and make a good home for his family and friends. Why cant i get it myself? Im just short of money this couple of months with student loans and other bills. I really enjoyed the base game so i decided to try my luck today with this DLC with the SEGA aniversary sales. As a long time Dynasty Warrior fan i was very excited about Lu Bus faction and the conquest of Wu and all other factions that were shuffled across the map, making the game even more playable. Thanks for reading my friends.

    <TEXT>Hey Eden and XYZgiveaways . Thanks for an another round. Im requesting The Reign Of Blood DLC for Total War Three Kingdoms. Im sure you read about it every round so im sorry if its a little bit similar to the former posts because there isnt much to talk about a Blood DLC. Its a graphical DLC for 3K. It enhances the battle by adding blood and a lot more animation when the two generals duel or even basic foot soliders have a skirmish. The battles look far more better with flags and blood particles covering the battlefield, showing the scale of the battles even more than it does without it. When generals battle depending on the general and his tighting style the DLC gives them more battle animations. For example if a brutish generals swing their axes the animation triggers that shows more force unlike generals who fight with more stylish style they will counter more and try to find openings. Would write even more about it but thats pretty much it what it does. My steam account https://steamcommunity.com/id/noxovac93 Game page https://store.steampowered.com/app/874310/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS__Reign_of_Blood/ The DLC is 2.99 #8364; Im EU region. Good luck to all.</TEXT>
