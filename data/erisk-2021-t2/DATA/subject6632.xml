    <DATE>2019-11-11 18:59:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, I'm looking for a movie or TV show and I can only remember one scene - a lady was trapped in a cage or cell of sorts. Bad guys (or bad girls) were either electrifying the floor or shooting at her feet to make the trapped woman "dance." I'm not sure but there MAY have been a scene with a dump truck driving wildly or crashing directly after the scene - not 100% on that though, not even 50%. The source material was either 70s or 80s, slight chance of 90s. No, it's not Cat's Eye (stephen king movie with three stories) or the movie Blood Dolls, but if anyone has any other suggestions, I'm all ears! Driving me nuts! It could be a movie or a TV show! Thanks for any help in advance! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sweden or Switzerland, both countries are bastions of cowardice so you should fit right in. They were both good with Hitler ruling Europe too. Sweden even sold raw materials to the Nazis - on credit, no less! No payment required, Herr Hitler, just don't invade us! What cowards. So the metal, rubber and stone used to build the concentration camps? The money used to buy the bullets that executed women, children, and Allied soldiers? Courtesy of Sweden and Switzerland.

    <TEXT>\*Minority. [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/) Right now we're a nation of cowards, the world is allowing another religious holocaust to happen in China, cities/towns razed and one million dead already purely for their religious preference. They starve/torture the men in camps and give the women a choice - go to the camps or live with "government practice husband" who forces them to learn the ways of the "common Chinese man." The woman is also expected to "service" her practice husband as she normally would her regular husband. So basically rape or death... and we stand by and do NOTHING. SHAMEFUL. We're allowing a horrible dictatorship to metastasize and grow. We will reap what we sow.

    <DATE>2020-02-03 13:19:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys! Yesterday I was hit with a 21 day hold on a pretty important transaction and I had a few questions about getting the hold reduced/removed. Background: This is my third transaction where I've used PayPal as my payment processor. The first two transactions were close to $1k and this latest one, the payment in question, is a little over $2k. The order is for digital goods and does not have a tracking number. \*The client **DOES NOT** have PayPal so he paid the invoice I sent with his credit/debit card.\* Story: Last evening after my client made the payment, I received the 21 day hold notice. I logged into my PayPal account and saw the held funds with a link that said "Get My Money" under the held amount. I clicked and it brought me to a page where it said I could get my money in 3-7 days if me and the client completed "Order Verification". I clicked on the Order Verification link and it brought me to a page where I could mark my Invoice as Completed, In Progress, or Cancelled. I clicked "Completed" and it redirected me to a page that said something like (paraphrased): "Thanks, we'll be sending this information to your customer, once he verifies the transaction we'll release the funds." Now, here's where the story gets hairy - **my client never received any email from PayPal asking for an order verification.** Perhaps this occurred because he doesn't have a PayPal account? He decided to call PayPal to see what he could do to verify the order via phone, but they told him something very confusing: they said that I, the seller, needed to mark the invoice as "processed" or "services rendered" in order to get the money released. But predictably, when I navigate back to the invoice, I don't have a "Processed" option - I only have "refund" or "archive". I now also have a message at the top of the invoice details that says (verbatim): "You have recently updated your order information. You #8217;ll get your money within 7 days of verification." To me that sounds like the process is incomplete on the customer's end - which he can't complete because he's not a PayPal member and they never emailed him. So now I've very confused - will the funds be available in 7 days or 21 days? Will they hold it indefinitely because the Order Verification can't be completed? Did this somehow get screwed up because the client doesn't have a PayPal account and he just paid the invoice with his credit/debit card? Basically I just want to know when I'm going to get my money, lol. **\*\*\*UPDATED QUESTION: If my client joins up with PayPal, could he verify the transaction after joining up with the same email and payment source he used to make the transaction?\*\*\***</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yesterday PayPal hit me with a 21 day hold on a pretty important transaction and I had a few questions about getting the hold reduced/removed.

    <TEXT>As per my original post, there's no tracking number for this transaction, it's a digital good/service... so what you're saying is they hold it indefinitely if there's no tracking? That doesn't make any sense being there's many transactions on PayPal that don't have tracking (payment for services, etc).</TEXT>

I'm refunding the client's funds and we're going with Google Pay. No fees and he'll just need to verify the transaction with Google Support. I've dealt with them many times and they are consistent. The money will be in my account by tomorrow or Wednesday the latest as long as the refund comes through promptly. After this mess, PayPal can suck it as far as I'm concerned, unless I have an international order and I have no choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got to jump in here as I'm a relatively recent escapee from New Jersitan. I hailed from Middlesex county. I escaped to Florida and I couldn't be happier. The taxes are lower, the roads are empty after 10pm (I like to drive spiritedly on occasion), and I own four firearms. You can buy as many guns as you want down here - no license or permit required, just the standard fed background check that takes 5 - 60 minutes to process and a 3 day waiting period. No trips to the police station, no fingerprinting, no registration lists, no permits, no fees, no gladhanding/greasing "the right wheels" to get your permit pushed through, no ridiculous 30 day waiting period, no NOTHING. Hell, down here they even sell suppressors and silencers at the Bass Pros, which are kind of like the Walmart of firearm shops. If you go to the specialized gun shops, then you can find some *really* amazing and cool stuff. The gun culture down here is also amazing. I've been at many different ranges and made several friends in the space of a couple months. In fact, that's probably what I enjoy the most about owning a gun - going to the range, practicing, maybe even enter a competition or two, and I get to meet some awesome people along the way. So although I obviously own my guns for home defense, that's not the kind of situation I look forward to, but what I do look forward to is going to the range and having fun. A lot of people who don't own guns just don't understand that there's much more to owning a firearm than home defense. Perhaps a good comparison is taking a self-defense class. You're taking the class so that you can handle yourself in a violent situation, but you're still having fun at the class and making friends, it's about learning new skills and having new experiences. Anyway, I hope you guys come to your senses some day and escape New Jeristan like I did, it's a really freeing feeling. :) PS I do miss NJ pizza, but the out-of-this-world seafood (never had bigger and more tasty shrimp than Gulf shrimp!), the best steaks in the country (Bern's Steakhouse wins best every year), and the to-die-for BBQ that Florida has to offer more than makes up for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, no... I paid $61k for the car. That's $2k under the sticker price, which is a very common deal for people to get. It's clearly labeled on the Bill of Sale. If you subtract the trade in value of $36k the total taxable amount comes to: $24k. The total finance charge was about $13.4k, which even if you add that up only comes to $37.4k, so how she comes to "about $40k is eligible for sales tax" (to quote her from our phone conversation) makes no sense to me. She's basically trying to double my sales tax. MVC told me to schedule an appointment and talk with a supervisor about the issue. No one at the facility could give me a yes or no when I asked if they taxed people on the finance charges of their new vehicles. When I said there was nothing in Florida law about taxing finance charges I would usually be greeted with silence and an attempted subject change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't understand how Kelley Blue Book Value comes into play with a new car. A new car has a sticker price. I paid very close to sticker price so there's nothing strange or odd about the sale price. Even if she want to charge me full sticker that would only come to $63420. $63420 - $36000 = $27420 taxable for sales tax. It makes no sense. To answer your query, 7.9%, but my credit is only just barely fair, I'm still rebuilding from a bad decision back in my late 20s. My last car loan was 9.6%.</TEXT>

In 2017, when I bought my other Shelby, I was not taxed on the cumulative interest of my loan. I was taxed on the the SALE PRICE OF THE CAR - TRADE-IN VALUE.

    <TEXT>Negative, the Blue Book Value for my 2017 Shelby was $36k-$40k, my trade-in value is in the lower end of the spectrum. There's nothing fishy with my trade-in or the price of my car. But for some reason she's nsistent on adding the interest from my loan to the value of the car, which is illegal and nowhere in the tax code. Asking to chat with a supervisor tomorrow, hopefully that happens. Again, she can't use her personal opinion to inflate the value of my car by $14k. BTW, no joke, this woman's name is Karen, and she is starting to live up to her namesake.

    <TEXT>I never claimed to be a financial savant...In fact, I came to this reddit forum for the specific reason that it's supposedly filled with individuals knowledgeable in tax code/law. There's no reason for her to be adding the interest from the loan to the total of the car sale. That's illegal, and every time I point it out, instead of linking to relevant tax code proving or disproving my query, I'm being tut-tutted for the car deal itself, which is immaterial to the issue. Whether I paid a 2.9% rate or a 15.9% rate, it's illegal to tax me on the interest of the auto loan, the law doesn't change based on your interest rate. Also, if you're unfamiliar with Florida tax code, I'd ask that you refrain from responding.  #8203; PS This wouldn't be the first time a motor vehicle employee has screwed/messed with people just because they could.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a different take on this. I honestly have an excellent set of genes. Although before I hit puberty, I basically looked like the white version of Urkel (thick glasses and all), once I hit my teen years I really filled out and now as an adult I'm a decent looking guy. My IQ is very high and I scored so well on my SATs that I was offered scholarships. But I never went to college. My parents divorced and I learned some very harsh lessons about life. (false accusations of domestic violence by my mother, false arrests, destruction of all my childhood pictures and movies out of spite, that sort of thing) This, combined with a childhood rife with school beatings and total rejection, made me a very jaded individual. My life left me with venom in my heart and a very strong feeling that the world simply does not deserve another person like me. There are some very good things I could be doing with my talents, but purely out of spite, I refuse to use them. It breaks my mother's heart and that gives me immense satisfaction. She more than anyone knows my talents and how I'm wasting them. I've refused to use my intellect for anything other than my own self gain, and even that effort is fully concentrated in an industry that is considered debaucherous, meaning my work generates money but absolutely no value to society. It also has the double effect of humiliating my mother - her son is financially successful yet she is still ashamed of him. She can't mention me or what I do to anyone she knows. In fact, many would say that my work is a net negative or even a burden on society, and in all honesty I'm proud to be said burden. In a twisted way, it actually feels good to be considered a stigma by a society that pays me so well. It's one of the few things in my miserable life that gives me a reason to wake up in the morning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it's his show so he decides the format. He doesn't want to remote interview people, he wants to keep it personal. If he's afraid of catching COVID, I say he's a coward. You only live once. Stand up and speak now or put your mask back on and forever hold your peace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a 6'2" MAN and I wouldn't have defended her either. In fact, I wouldn't defend any woman. Have you ever heard of the feminist movement?? Women are just as independent, strong and powerful as men. The woman in the video should have defended herself against her attacker and kicked his ass. If she allows herself to be treated like that, then that's what she deserves - and before you call me a sexist or a misogynist, if it was a man being treated that way, I would say the same thing. Equal strokes for different folks! ;) I wonder, what makes you think that as a woman you're entitled to impromptu male bodyguards??? Who the fuck are you to decide that you're entitled to male bodies!? Women aren't entitled to use men as their own personal bodyguards, so go fuck yourself, Danielle.</TEXT>
