    <TEXT>Pvp in the early days was easy, get a ship and fight. Nowadays it requires traits, skills and sets to keep the enemy player disabled for as long as possible to kill him. Pve isn't based on your overall equipment. If you got a decent team u can run a t1_4 ship in an advanced queue, sit back and relax. (I've pushed the kobayashi maru in hive elite sooo) the main thing in pve is dps. People just want faster and more deadly firepower. Competitive is a mix of both, get objectives and such from the pve side and then brawl it out vs the other team pvp side. That being said pvp is still fun. Yet no real reward are given towards it, no progress in a reputation. It's just an extra aspect of people that want a better challenge than elite queues that they know by heart.</TEXT>
