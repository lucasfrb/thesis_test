    <TITLE>Does it take this long to get your schedule?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-13 19:37:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, so I was hired as a seasonal employee and I had orientation last week. We were told we #8217;d get a call about our schedules on Monday. I decided to call and they told me our schedules weren #8217;t ready and that if I didn #8217;t receive a call the next day to call again. So I called again after waiting and the person who answered took my name and number and said I #8217;d get a call. It #8217;s still early so I #8217;m going to wait again today but I don #8217;t want to call 3 days in a row. Does it usually take this long especially now with new hires? This is my first job so I don #8217;t want to screw up :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m scheduled for tomorrow and they never called me back, I guess I #8217;ll just go in and see what happens. My sisters brother in law also works at another target and said that everything is completely unorganized and no one noticed that he just didn #8217;t show up for work one day so I guess they #8217;re just that busy. Hopefully it goes well for you</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tips for fulfillment?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-20 01:24:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey y #8217;all, I started as a seasonal fulfillment employee on Sunday. Doing pick up orders was pretty easy but doing orders that are being shipped out was a bit of a struggle. The guy who trained me was super nice but he talked a bit fast at times and there were some things I forgot to ask him so now I was wondering if anyone here could help me out 1. My back was absolutely KILLING me as well as my head, if anyone else felt this do you get used to it?? I took an Advil after my shift was over 2. When I first get there do I go to the room where we leave pick ups to get a cart? That #8217;s kind of what I saw my trainer do but another member came in looking for a cart and couldn #8217;t find the kind with 2 baskets and it looked like she used a regular one, so can we do that? 3. Do I have to announce over the walkie when I #8217;m going on break/lunch? Any other tips are welcomed, I #8217;m a bit nervous as I work tomorrow again :/ I #8217;m hoping I can catch on soon</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you this was super helpful, for some reason it freaks me out using the walkie so I #8217;d rather just talk face to face with another member about taking my break. On my first day I didn #8217;t take my break until 15 minutes before my shift was over and I didn #8217;t even announce it, my trainer just sent me on my way and after the break I went home so it didn #8217;t hit me until after that I #8217;m probably supposed to let them know. But thank you your comment was very helpful!</TEXT>

I didn #8217;t even think about the water lol I #8217;ll definitely try to have my bottle with me, thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just checked my schedule to double check what time I go in tomorrow and they changed my Sunday from 10 am-6 pm to 1 am-6 pm. 17 hours. Has this happened to anyone? Obviously it has to be a mistake because there #8217;s no way that #8217;s legal? I #8217;m gonna say something tomorrow because I definitely will not be doing that lol I #8217;m only seasonal and only supposed to be doing part time hours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is my first thanksgiving working and I #8217;m scared as hell ;-; for the target veterans, is thanksgiving worse than Black Friday? Or is it the other way around? I #8217;m scheduled 10am -6pm (fulfillment) so the store will be closed most of my shift but that last hour is making me fear for my life lol there #8217;s also the possibility that they #8217;ll ask me to stay later. For those who do fulfillment on thanksgiving, do they still make us do OPU even though the store is closed or will we do SFS? And since the store is closed how do we get in? I feel like this is a dumb question but I forgot to ask someone lol will they open the door for employees?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On the verge of promoting myself to guest after 3 weeks here :)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-04 02:08:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started in fulfillment a little more than 3 weeks ago and from the very beginning I could tell my team leader didn #8217;t like me. She would talk to me like I #8217;m stupid and if I ever let her know about something I couldn #8217;t find she #8217;d basically interrogate me to see if I REALLY tried to find it until she #8217;d decide to INF it. Well today I finally noticed that when any of my other coworkers (also seasonal) ask her about an item she #8217;ll talk to them all sweet and just INF it without interrogating them. She #8217;s overall friendly with literally every single person in the store EXCEPT me. I #8217;ve never been rude to this woman so idk why she acts like that towards me. Lately all my shifts have been SFS. I hate doing SFS and I #8217;m much faster in OPU while one SFS batch takes me at least an hour. Today my STL very loudly said  #8220;your pick rate is way too low just go stock instead #8221; as I was finishing a batch. There were a handful of team members around who heard and started laughing and one of them even told him to calm down. I stocked for the last 4 hours of my shift and every time my fulfillment coworkers saw me they #8217;d look at me like they felt bad for me. I honestly just want to quit already cause I almost cried when he yelled at me and I was never shown how to stock or anything. I don #8217;t even want to put in my 2 weeks, I just want to stop showing up. I applied here because I desperately need money for Christmas presents but this is seriously not worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much :( there #8217;s still just a lot of things I don #8217;t understand like with on hand, on floor and stuff and the whole reason he screamed at me was because my team leader had me look for a beanie she was absolutely sure she saw a  #8220;ton #8221; of on the floor but there were absolutely none left and he got upset with me for wasting time and not INFing it. I really just don #8217;t want to work with these people anymore and my depression and anxiety has gotten 10000x worse since I started there so I think I #8217;m just gonna quit next week</TEXT>

I honestly don #8217;t know how y #8217;all do it (esp fulfillment). Well today I checked the New Years schedule and I #8217;m not on for that week so I #8217;m assuming that next week is my last. I don #8217;t even mean to sound ungrateful for this job but feel like a HUGE weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Anyways....assuming that Monday is my last day (that #8217;s the only day I #8217;m scheduled next week lmao) will they let me know or is that it?? I #8217;m assuming they #8217;d want my employee discount card back but I #8217;m too nervous to ask them about it lol and do I have to wait until next payday to get my final check??

    <TITLE>Reduction in only one breast??</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-21 07:59:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;m a 32 or 34B cup in one breast and I wanna say some C cup in the other. When I wear a B bra it fits my smaller boob and the other one will not stay in. I always wear some sort of bra 24/7 (sports bra, bralette, etc) even around my house because my right breast is so obviously bigger than the other one and people have pointed it out before even if I #8217;m wearing a baggy shirt, but sometimes regular bras don #8217;t help hide it. I want to have surgery to make the bigger breast small like the other one but I #8217;m not sure if that #8217;s even a thing since it #8217;s not a DRAMATIC difference but it #8217;s enough for other people to notice and it bothers me as well. Has anyone ever had something like this done? I #8217;m not sure if this is a dumb question but would the cost be lower since I only want one breast done?? I feel kind of selfish considering doing it since it #8217;s not a dramatic difference like what I #8217;ve seen on this sub :/ I #8217;m very skinny so I feel like going smaller would look best on me, I can #8217;t handle the big breast i already have Any advice is welcomed</TEXT>
