    <TITLE>Trying to get rid of an old car</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-18 03:55:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey I'm looking for some advice on what to do with an old car my family has. It's a 2002 Toyota Sienna with about 180k miles. One one day I was getting ready to take it somewhere and it just didn't start. I tried jump starting the battery but did not work. I'm thinking it's just too old and has died on me. My question is what can I do with it? Is there a company that would be willing to buy it for parts and tow it away from me? Or does anyone know of a company that tows it away for donation? Right now it's just literally sitting in my driveway taking up space. Looking for suggestions/tips here. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A few tips when buying tickets from someone on Reddit.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-03 20:02:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>**CREDIT GOES TO /u/MyLastNameIsIceCream** Original Link is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/3zqi6x/a_few_tips_when_buying_tickets_from_someone_on/). Last year I had a friend get scammed through a Reddit user. It may seem obvious to some, but there are a few things you should do when purchasing tickets from someone on this sub. * I know this is messed up for the users that are new to Reddit, but make sure you check to see how long someone has been using Reddit. You can often tell if someone is using a throwaway to scam someone. There is nothing to stop someone from scamming you from their main account, but it should give you feel a bit better. * The best option is obviously to purchase the tickets in person, but for some of us that might not be possible because you could be coming from out of state. * If you do have to pay for tickets over the internet Paypal is probably your best bet. There are a lot of websites that can be used to scam you. DO NOT SEND MONEY AS A GIFT THROUGH PAYPAL. Paypal offers a 180 day buyer protection when you pay through the request money option. * If you buy through Paypal you can ask the seller to send the sign in info to you and have the address changed before the tickets actually get sent out. (I did this last year and it went smooth.) You can then change the sign in details to whatever you want so that only you have access. * **Note: The original person to purchase the tickets can call in and give their credit card used to change the tickets back to their own. Credit card trumps all. This is why you use Paypal so you can be protected in the event of this happening.** * For the love of all that is holy, please stay away from any type of cards (Vanilla, Moneygram, etc.) This is step one of scamming someone. Paypal or handing over cash is the only safe option if you aren't getting your balls busted open by someone selling off of Stubhub. * "As an added precaution, I also ask anyone I'm dealing with online to add me on their personal Facebook account. Most everyone has no problem with that, and it lets me see that they're a real person with real friends/family/history/a job, and the fact that they're willing to drop that wall of anonymity helps me feel a bit more comfortable. I also take screenshots of all their nice, old-looking family members so I know who to rat them out to should the deal go sideways. :~)" - /u/betteroffatnight I would love to see this added onto the stickied post to give everyone looking some help if possible. Not everyone knows all the safety of buying outside of official sellers and I would hate to see another person get scammed like my friend did. I'm gonna be working when tickets go on sale so I wont be able to buy a ticket for a while, but I'll for sure see you guys on the Fields someway some how! Have a good day and good luck with your purchases! Oh, feel free to add your own tips too. I may have not covered everything and anything can help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't watch a lot of Phoenix games, so please correct me or enlighten me Suns fans. In this video, it just seems like he just stands around on defense and ball watches (similar to Harden). How is his defense though? Is it more of just "this team sucks on defense" or does he need to improve on that end. But incredible but he is doing at this age. He will get better, I'm sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like as a GM, wouldn't it make sense to call your best players to let them know of whats going to happen? It just seems like common sense if you trade one of your two best players, it would be logical to just pick up the phone and be like "hey Kyle, just letting you know we are trading Demar. It was tough decision but this is what our plan is. Lmk what you think" etc. Magic talked about this on the Kimmel show the other day how he consulted Lebron on their signings and how he used to consulted when he played. I know Morey has mentioned doing the same with Harden and Paul as well. Just seems like if you are going to make this big of a move in your organization, there should be some transparency between them.</TEXT>

Ticket was $850 20 rows behind Astros dugout. Worth every penny. I also went to game 5, and tickets were like $400 for like 10 rows from the field along the 3rd baseline.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something I'm seeing in the some comments I'd like to point out. We were never technically red/yellow in our jersey schemes. Yes our logo was but our jerseys didn't have lot of yellow on it. It was just the trimming around the collar that had yellow with primary color being red or white. I say this because I remember few years back we had alternate jerseys that were red with lot of yellow and we looked like a happy meal box. Wasn't a fan of those. I wish we would just keep it simple like when we did these [throwbacks](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspacecityscoop.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F09%2F78361829-houston-rockets-v-philadelphia-76ers.jpg.jpg amp;c=sc amp;w=850 amp;h=560).

    <TEXT>Our defense is trash right now. I know people are going to immediately point to Ariza and Luc but they would not help right now. The biggest issue is losing Jeff Bzdelik. He was our defensive guru and it is costing us. Our communication is poor, we aren't rotating correctly, and it is easy pass down the lane. Our rim protection is poor even with Clint. When Clint is out, it becomes easier to fuck us than a hooker on the streets of Thailand. I think we can and will turn it around but we need to do it quick and stop these bad habits. You can't afford to be 1-4 in the western conference.</TEXT>

This was a good win for the Rockets who need to gain that swagger back they had last year. I think once we get Gordon back, you will see the chemistry start to form back together. No way do we win 65 games again, but I think we can definitely right the ship and win somewhere in the mid 50s. Also Dipo is fuckin good. Dude is not scared of the big moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know everyone saying these look dope, but I'm kinda tired of this. We do this every year with our alternative jersey and it sucks. Tired of the Chinese jersey. If you're going to do that, then get rid either red or white jersey, so we can get some actual city jerseys that say clutch city or something. China must bring in shit ton of money for us to keep doing this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean they look cool, but I'd rather it have clutch city or rep the houston culture in some way. Not saying we shouldn't do chinese jersey, it's just we've done this so many times in the past. If you want to do that then get rid of either white or red, then have rotation of black, red or white, china, city.</TEXT>

The placing of the words between the numbers is just weird and also a fucking tshirt jersey? Pass. Then the one of Harden with big yellow trimming on the side makes us look like a walking happy meal. The old school ones had it right with nice subtle hint of yellow. I love those.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a Rockets fan, I really don't. I wish we had more ball movement and would take some mid rangers. I understand the math behind it and what not, but sometimes forcing a bad three is worse than taking a mid range shot. Especially when you have good shooters in Harden, Gordon, and CP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Super Bowl Experiece, it's kinda like a fan fest. Went to the one in Houston and it was a blast. They had bunch of mini games set up that you could compete with your friends. Also they had huge carnival like set up outside the fan fest area which was dope. If you willing to pay some serious cash, they have concerts going on. I think for us they had Taylor Swift one night and Bruno Mars the other.

    <TEXT>Lol people who think he has the easiest coaching job forgot they had pretty much the same roster before he got there and Mark Jackson couldn't get this team past the 2nd round. Their defense was good, but he took their offense to another level and implemented a system of them sharing the ball. It also helped that Draymond had his coming out party the same year. I remember reading an article during Kerr's first season how he ran his training camps. He made them do basic middle school passing drills and all the players hated it but he came in with a purpose and built a foundation. At this point his core players know the system and can run it no matter who the coach is. He did his job, so FOH here with that bullshit "I could coach the team" or "Mark Jackson needed more time".</TEXT>

Gordon has been too inconsistent and CP just looks like lost a step. In a 7 game series, teams will just game plan against Harden. Sigh I really do hope we turn it around once we get Capela back, but our defense has been atrocious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We just don't have the focus/intensity this year. I remember thinking how last year we were just laser focused the whole season + playoffs and fell short. I wondered how we would recover from that and if we could bring the same intensity again next year. People underestimate how hard that is to do for 82 game season for any team. The game yesterday just shows our underlining problem that I've been seeing for past few years. Iso ball is great and all, but there really is something about having other players involved and moving around on the offense. We are asking Harden to do too much and he is willing to, but we won't win like this. I just hope something changes in our style offensively and defensively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just think players like playing when Chris is controlling the offense, not saying they don't like playing with Harden though. He just looks to get everyone involved and people get their touches. That just keeps other players more engaged and let's be honest, when you're involved in something you are willing to try harder. I feel like for a defense it's easier to let a guy iso and have the other 4 players just sit and wait for the ball. Now that offense can be effective but relies on those players sitting at 3 point line to make their shots.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LeGM is missing the point here. I don't think it is wrong for him to ask for a trade in the middle of his contract. Players have the right just like a team could trade the player as well. It's how they went about it. Week before the deadline, you request a trade. Then after few days you tell the organization, you have your agent straight up tell Woj about it. Did you really think the NOLA was gonna be in a rush to trade one of the best players in the NBA just because you requested it a week before the deadline? No semi competent team is going to do that. They will take their time and make sure they get the best deal possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a UH alumni/fan, this. If he had went to P5 school and had decent defensive coordinator, he would be top 5 pick. He literally just got by with his talents at our school and we did nothing to help him develop. We would just line up across the center and hope he beats the double/triple team. In the NFL, I fully expect teams to move him around the line and put him in spots in order to succeed.</TEXT>

I already said I don't think it is wrong for him to ask for a trade and I don't blame him for wanting to leave. No body is disagreeing that he gave his all to that org. My whole point was his agent handled it wrong by leaking the trade and trying to force Pelicans hand. Which goes back to my point of LeBron misinterpreting why people are saying negative things about AD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Harden's shooting lately has got me worried. I don't know if it's the wrist or what, but he has been off on his 3s since ASB. There were two possession near the end of the game when Curry was on him and he took his step back 3. Yes he has been extraordinarily good at this year but lately he has not been hitting those. I wish he would just take Curry off the dribble in those situation, especially in the 4th quarter. If he needs to take a game or two off, then so be it. There was a stretch in 3rd quarter, where they just pulled Capela away from the paint then Looney feasted on offensive rebounds. We did not box out at all. Easy mistake to fix but still we can't have these kind of mental lapses in the playoffs, esp against GS. Shump has not been great for us. He had a good stretch in 2nd quarter but fell flat after that. Give credit to GS's defense. They were making us uncomfortable all night, especially at the 3 point line. They were challenging shots and we had far too many possession go late in the shot clock. Boogie was unreal. He made toyed with Capela all night. I wish we tried hunting him more on offense in 1v1 situations. Also, Warriors offense looked like their regular ball moving offense tonight. It's weird. When they have KD, they force feed him and he isos and slows down the game. Today they played with their pace. Interested to see how it will be like in the playoffs when they have their full starting line up.</TEXT>

I feel like last few times we played yall, you guys would give the ball to KD and let him work (not a bad option to have). Today it just seemed like everyone was moving and cutting, similar to how you guys were pre KD.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-14 06:35:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was curious to see Harden's shooting percentage when taking a step back 3. I've been noticing he's been in a slump (combination of wrist + fatigue) so was wondering what the actual numbers were. Below is his shooting percentage by month if anyone else is curious. * October - 10/20 for 50% * November - 26/80 for 32.5% * December - 47/96 for 49% * January - 52/131 for 39.7% * February - 27/73 for 37% * March - 13/49 for 26.5% Overall he is 175/449 for 39%. It's on a downward trend and it's probably safe to say he won't be shooting like he did in December. It's a really difficult shot and feel like he is starting to rely on it too much. All data was taken from [here](https://stats.nba.com/player/201935/shooting/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh I don't even care abou the MVP race. Give it to Giannis. He's having great season and their team has been consistent all year. Congrats. I would rather have championship. Also - in 10 years, are they going to be talking about the phenomenal year Giannis had or the year Harden went off and averaged 36ppg. No remembers Dirk's year in 2007, but people still talk about Kobe and 4 straight 50 point games and averaging 35 ppg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think biggest upgrade for you guys will be Donovan being more experienced and better. He seems like the type of guy that will play with chip on his shoulder after losing to us last year. I can see you guys using the Bucks strategy on Harden. I feel like y'all are one of the few teams that can effectively do that with Rudy Gobert as your paint protector. Harden has added a floater to his game and if he is hitting that, that strategy doesn't really work. For us, we are deeper than last year. But we aren't as focused. We tend to make silly mistakes, let teams back in, get complacent, etc. I think two biggest things for us will be limiting 2nd chance points and staying healthy. Chris Paul and Eric Gordon have to be hitting their shots to get the pressure off Harden. All in all, I think you guys are better than last year and we aren't as good as last year (we are still very good though). I see us winning in 6 or 7 games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes over the whole season we weren't as good. But we've had lot of turnover in our roster from November/December, so that doesn't really mean much. I'd look at stats post ASB or even after Feb. Only stat that really stands out to me is the defensive rebounding. We haven't really struggled on the glass this year. If we lose, it will be because we can't grab a rebound and give up too many 2nd chance points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not that the strategy doesn't work, it's just Jazz didn't have the personnel or the proper execution for this to work. * Rubio wasn't even shading Harden's left. He was straight up guarding his ass and behind him. * Gobert was giving up his position too quickly and challenged Harden too high in the paint. This allowed too many easy baskets to Capela. * Jazz wing players do not have the length or athleticism to challenge Capela on the lobs AND quickly rotate back to the corner shooters. Buck were extremely good at this and were able to contest those shots or intercept passes. Giannis was especially good at this because all he has to do is take one step from the paint to able to challenge the 3 point shooters. * This strategy relies on the Rockets role players not hitting their shots. Even if they hit 35%, it makes the strategy hard to execute. Tucker and House were getting lot of open looks but started out 1/8. Then late in the 2nd quarter, PJ started to hit them and House started to find his groove in the 2nd half. Rockets took a single digit lead to double digits really quick cause of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't agree with that at all lol. Trezz would have never got the playing time under us to develop like that. Bev wanted out and requested to be traded during exit interviews. Lou would have helped get buckets but clippers do good job of hiding him on defense. We can #8217;t hide him and Harden. Plus come playoff time, you need star power to win a series and none of those guys would have been able to take pressure off Harden and run our offense when he #8217;s out. It #8217;s big reason we lost in  #8216;17 against the Spurs. I agree financially we would have been better off, but probably don #8217;t get 65 wins and take the Warriors to game 7 with those guys instead of cp3.</TEXT>

Usually the upper deck is pretty filled by game time but the lower level is all corporate (Oil  amp; Gas baby) owned so those people don't really care to be there on time. Yesterday was perfect storm of things - Astros game across the street at the same time, Bernie rally in DT, plus bad weather. So traffic was pretty bad. My friend lives in suburbs and took hour to get to DT, then another 20 minutes to find parking. He left at 5:45 PM and by the time he got in there, it was mid 1st quarter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think they will go the Utah route. They don't have rim protector like Gobert for it to be possible. Plus Warriors can throw bunch of different players at Harden to guard him straight up. Klay, Dray, Iggy. Hell even KD and Livingston can do decent job. I think throwing him bunch of different defenders is Warriors best defense against Harden.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously I think we got some missed calls, but that is going to happen unfortunately. Especially with players like Harden and Paul who have a reputation. We definitely still had a chance and wasted a great opportunity to steal a game. As long as we get game 2, we did our job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the complete opposite about Green. I love the guy and he's H-Town for lyfe but he has been terrible this year on defense. He is constantly missing rotation/switches, and gets left in the dust. There is lot of miscommunication when he is out there. I think getting Rivers back will help out our bench some. He is good iso scorer and can defend Steph relatively well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yah I hate how slow Harden takes on offense at times. He does not need to be jogging the ball up and cross half court with exactly 16 seconds, then wait another 10 seconds trying to hunt the switch. Warriors are doing really good job of letting Steph hedge the screen then blocking passing and driving lanes. Then Harden is stuck with 4 seconds to get a shot off and it's just not going to be a good one. 100% agree about our defense. They played exceptionally well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Draymond does good job on contesting the lobs so that affectively takes away his points. Then for some reason, Looney was just bullying him. He wasn't winning rebounding position and Warriors did good job just taking him out the game. He always struggles against the Warriors when they go small.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Give credit to the Warriors defense. Everytime we tried to switch Curry on Harden, he would hedge and wait till the primary defender could recover. Harden couldn't pass to the screener cause the other help defenders were waiting on it. Warriors have lot of length on defense and are able to help and come back to contest shots. I'm sure Rockets will adjust though. IMO, we need to start running our offense quicker in the shot clock instead of at 14 seconds.</TEXT>

Also had two turnovers on the Paul charge (and still scored) and Tucker stepping out of bounds. It's not like we weren't scoring. We just couldn't grab rebounds (again) and they got 2nd chance points. At 2:40, Steph misses a 19 foot shot, Looney gets a rebound, finds Klay who hits a 3. 97-84. At 50 seconds, Steph misses a floater, grabs his own rebound, quickly puts it back up and gets fouled. Hits 2 FTs. 101-95</TEXT>

It was so obvious that it wasn't our offense. We couldn't get stops and when we did, we couldn't get a rebound. Though I will say, I wish Harden was more aggressive calling for the ball or setting himself up instead of walking gingerly up the court and standing 6 feet behind 3pt line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rockets had a great opportunity in front of them but couldn't do it. But let's stop acting like the Rockets choked or something. We spent past two years talking about how stacked Warriors are and how good they were without KD. Yes their role players aren't what they once were but there is a fucking reason they keep winning despite that. They still have a MVP, FMVP, DPOY, and whatever the holy goodness Klay is. They are hard fucking team to beat. I hope the Warriors run the rest of the playoffs so I don't feel too bad losing these close hard fought games. I thought MDA made some terrible decisions. Every time he put Gerald in, Warriors would go on a run. Yes he hit 2 threes towards end of first half, but you can't play him that much in the 2nd. Also he rested Chris Paul way too long in the 4th. It's win or go home - fuck rest. This one hurts more than last year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; There #8217;s been a sort of controversy stemming from the ending of Game 6, involving Chris Paul, Steph Curry and the usage of the court in Toyota Center. As the story was originally reported by The Athletic  #8212; and since corrected  #8212; Chris Paul ordered Steph Curry off the Houston court the night before Game 6 in a brash manner.  gt;  gt; Speaking to The Athletic Houston Saturday morning, Paul said the incident in question actually occurred prior to Game 4. Paul went to Houston #8217;s arena for a workout and to get up shots, and upon arrival saw Curry shooting on the court. Paul proceeded to the weight room, and after coming back on the floor saw Curry still shooting on the main floor.  #8220;Man, go put a shirt on, #8221; he says Curry joked after seeing Paul still shirtless from the workout.

    <TEXT>As great as those guys on the Clippers are playing, it's unfair to think they would have performed like that if they stayed. Trezz would have never got the playing time under us to develop like that. Bev wanted out and requested to be traded during exit interviews. Lou would have helped get buckets but clippers do good job of hiding him on defense. We can #8217;t hide him and Harden. Plus come playoff time, you need star power to win a series and none of those guys would have been able to take pressure off Harden and run our offense when he #8217;s out. It #8217;s big reason we lost in  #8216;17 against the Spurs. I agree financially we would have been better off, but probably don #8217;t get 65 wins and take the Warriors to game 7 in 2018 with those guys instead of cp3.</TEXT>

Most players are always looking for the advantage on the court when they are hoopin, that's basically what analytics is. I don't think anyone in the front office suggesting to use analytics is saying you have to go by the numbers. It's mainly a way to support what they are seeing on the court and to take into consideration. There's a happy balance to achieve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Follow their social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc). They usually post where they are going to be and what time to arrive. I went to taping during the Super Bowl in Houston. I got there at like 4:30 AM and people were already lined up. So if you have nothing to do it but stand in line at the middle of the night, go for it! It was pretty cool seeing the show live and during the breaks they interacted with us and let us ask them questions. Stephen A even took some pics with fans.</TEXT>

I'm watching it for the entertainment - PP outrageous takes, Beadle always egging him on along, Billups and Rose's reactions. They were funny in their own way. I will miss the great value Inside the NBA panel. Also - get Katie Nolan to host.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keep the team intact. Sign better wing players. More movement on offense. Only make a trade if it brings you another all star level talent, other wise you keep EG, Clint, CP. Maybe I'm bias but I still think we were top 4 team in the league this year. Just unfortunately had to play the Warriors in the 2nd round. I think we will be fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All these leaks have me confused af. This is not going to go well if we don't land Butler. Edit: To clarify, I mean our chemistry will not be great. Our players can still be professionals and still be pissed that they shopped around. Look at Lowry when Demar got traded. Took him half the season to get over it. Hell, even last year when we shopped around Gordon, you could tell it played small part in him playing badly to begin the season.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gordon and bunch of first round picks were mentioned. Capela was never mentioned in those talks. Neither was Tucker. MDA has stated multiple times that he wants no part of getting rid of Tucker. But yes they can still be professional about but also be pissed at the same time. Lowry was pissed for 75% of the season because they traded his best friend. He put his head down, worked, and didn't say shit. But they didn't hit their full potential till Feb when he and Masai had a talk. So it can still be a problem regardless if you're a professional about it or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was after game 2 of WCF. We had just made a comeback down 7 or 9 with like minute left. We cut the lead, had the final possession, and chance to win. James brings the ball down and passes to Dwight at the three point line and Dwight quickly passes the ball back. He got doubled and turned it over. Felt like if we won the game, the series turns out whole lot different. Also we lost Bev earlier that year for the season.

    <TEXT>My league is going from 2 RB league to 1 RB and adding extra flex position. It's a 10 team auction league $200. 13 roster spots. So it's now QB, 1 RB, 2 WR, TE, 2 FLEX, K, DST, 4 BN. My question does this make RB more valuable and I go hard for on the big rb or spend lot of money on elite/good WR and try to find value at RB?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>QB - I definitely would try to find grab one in the draft and not stream. With 14 teams, you're likely not going to be able to find a good one to stream. Def - You could probably get away with streaming but it will be risky. I wouldn't reach for one the top defenses in the draft though. There is always one or two teams that surprise everyone on defense which you can probably grab. I would definitely draft one but much later in the draft. Kicker - Still think you can stream that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We are really bad at defense. We replaced a great defensive coach and smart defensive point guard and its biting us in the ass. MDA really needs to start playing Capela more and stop going so small. On another note, I think the MDA era will be done after this year. I can see this team being very different too. I don't think Capela really has improved much past 2 years and that could just be on the Rockets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean we played better and it was good to see Capela play with lot more energy. Seems like Capela had an injury he sustained over the summer and is still recovering. Hopefully Gordon comes back better after the injury too. I think our line up with Westbrook/Harden/House/Tucker/Capela is our best defensive line up and we need to play them more. I would like to see us do this against higher competition though. No knock on the Warriors, they just have lot of young players right now.</TEXT>

Westbrook is doing what he is asked and very grateful we have him. Would have lost few games if it wasn't for him. We have had a very easy schedule and are 7-3. I'll take it for now but our defense still needs to get better. Big test coming tomorrow and hopefully it gets better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said this in the post game thread - If teams are going to double Harden and force the ball out of his hands, he has got to move without the ball. We can't afford him standing 30 feet out while rest of the team tries to make something happen. It's like in the NFL - if you have a great WR, you don't just line him up in the same spot every single time, you move him around to keep the defense guessing. We need to start doing that with Harden. Run off ball screen for him, put him in the corner, etc. Having him 30 feet out is not helping us when he doesn't have the ball. Also it doesn't help that everyone else looks like a chicken with their head cut off when they are forced to do something. Also Luka is fuckin good. I hate that he's on the Mavs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>2025 pick is protected tho. If it lands 1-10, Houston gets to keep it and the obligation to give the pick is gone. [Source](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed): 2025 first round draft pick to Oklahoma City (swap, Oklahoma City incoming) Oklahoma City has the right to swap its 2025 1st round pick for Houston's 2025 1st round pick protected for selections 1-10 or the L.A. Clippers' 2025 1st round pick (if the Houston pick falls within its protected range and is therefore not conveyable, then Houston's obligation to Oklahoma City will be extinguished)]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bike was delivered today. They called me hour before my time (between to 2pm-4pm) and asked if they could come by early. I live in an apartment and they brought the bike to the hallway and assembled it there. Once they assembled it they moved it into the apartment but said as far as they can go is like 5 feet. No big deal for me as it was pretty easy to move with the wheels. They were wearing masks and gloves the whole time too. Awesome delivery and no complaints!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does it worry any LA fans that AD has been inconsistent since the bubble started? There are times where he does look that top 5 player the media hypes him up to be, but then there are games like yesterday. He didn't look comfortable at all without Lebron. To be fair, the whole team looked out of sync. PS. Watching Dwight post up every possession and his teammates ignore him only to finally throw him the ball. And then he turns it over. Man, I don't miss that Dwight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought this might have been the best game we've played as a team all year. I was really worried about how we would fare without Harden in the line up, but Green and Gordon took over. It was good to see that ball move and our defense was in sync all day. Didn't watch a lot of OKC games this year but their offense yesterday looked a lot like the Rockets last year. Not a lot of movement and lot of iso. Not sure if this is by design or just product of Rockets defense.</TEXT>
