    <TITLE>Question around Grav interacting with All is Dust.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-22 10:53:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the Grav profile is Str5, AP-3, D1. So against Rubricks, the all is dust rule would kick in to provide a +1 to our saves. However, Grav against anything with a 3+ save gets D3 damage. So would all is dust still kick in providing us 4+ Invuln, or does the extra rule for Grav override that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey everyone, Just looking for some advice and/or criticism on my 1500 point list. Ill be going against my brother who will be taking Mars Admech. Pretty sure he will have Cawl along with shooty Kastelans and lots (6?) Heavy Grav destoyers. Its either this or I reduce the Rubrics, remove the enlightened and a MVB and add in magnus, but hes like 1/3rd of the army and not sure how effective he will be. ++ Chaos - Thousand Sons - Battalion [1498pts] ++ ++ HQ [346pts] ++ - Ahriman on Disc of Tzeentch [166pts]: Glamour of Tzeentch, Prescience, Tzeentch's Firestorm - Daemon Prince of Tzeentch [180pts]: WL Trait= Otherworldly Prescience, Relic= Dark Matter Crystal, Gaze of Fate, Warptime, Wings, 2x Malefic Talons ++ Troops [609pts] ++ - Rubric Marines [226pts] .

    <TITLE>1500pt list advice vs World Eaters</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-01 12:17:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey everyone, Just looking for advice and/or criticism on my list going against Khorne World Eaters. Pretty sure my opponent will have at least 1 DPoK, 2-3 10x Berserkers in Rhinos. My plan with the list is to get the fusion in turn 1 to pop vehicles / kill characters if i can get to them. The Shadowseer with suit of subtle knives will be getting into combat hopefully with some berserkers then with the Lightning Reflexes strategem and the 2 psychic powers getting mortal wounds off on a unit when they roll 1's, 2's 3's and 4's. The Deathjester with curtainfall will also be making use of stratgems to cause more hits and hopefully more mortal wounds.

    <TEXT>Hey Everyone. I have a 1,500 point game this weekend against my brother playing Khorne. He often fields Obliterators and/or Mutilators and this will be the first time playing harlequins against them. I normally just go with the Embracem but I've been trying to work out what is the best melee weapon to take them on. Stats are T4, 3W, 2+,5++). The Embrace forces them to take their invuln, Caress wounds on 3's while the Kiss can obviously 1 shot them. All advice and opinions welcome!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, So I love the fluff behind Deathwatch and love the way the models look, but I don't actually play them. I'm getting bored of playing my Crimson Fists and im thinking of proxying them for some Deathwatch in a game or 2. I got the majority of this build from Josh @ MWG and im just wondering if it will work for friendly-semi competitive games. By that I mean something i can just stick down on the table against more or less any faction but still have a good chance at winning. **++ Unbound Army (Faction) (Imperium - Deathwatch) [53 PL, 987pts] ++** **+ HQ +** **Watch Captain [7 PL, 130pts]:** Bolt Pistol, Jump Pack, Storm shield, The Beacon Angelis, Thunder hammer **Watch Master [7 PL, 130pts]:** Lord of Hidden Knowledge, Warlord **+ Troops +** **Intercessors [5 PL, 101pts]:** Auxiliary Grenade Launcher . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor Sergeant:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle **Intercessors [5 PL, 101pts]:** Auxiliary Grenade Launcher . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle . **Intercessor Sergeant:** Bolt Pistol, Bolt rifle **Veterans [17 PL, 268pts]** . **Black Shield:** Power sword, Storm shield . **Vanguard Veteran:** Lightning Claw (Pair) . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Storm Bolter . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Storm Bolter . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Storm Bolter . **Veteran w/ Heavy Weapon:** Deathwatch Frag Cannon . **Veteran w/ Heavy Weapon:** Deathwatch Frag Cannon . **Veteran w/ Heavy Weapon:** Deathwatch Frag Cannon . **Watch Sergeant:** Plasma pistol, Xenophase Blade **+ Flyer +** **Corvus Blackstar [12 PL, 257pts]:** Auspex Array, Hurricane bolter, Twin lascannon . **2x Stormstrike Missile Launchers:** 2x Stormstrike missile launcher **++ Unbound Army (Faction) (Imperium - Deathwatch) [65 PL, 1012pts] ++** **+ HQ +** **Watch Captain [5 PL, 84pts]:** Bolt Pistol, Master-crafted Boltgun, Power sword **Watch Captain [5 PL, 84pts]:** Bolt Pistol, Master-crafted Boltgun, Power sword **+ Troops +** **Veterans [9 PL, 100pts]** . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun **Veterans [19 PL, 239pts]** . **Biker:** Twin boltgun . **Biker:** Twin boltgun . **Biker:** Twin boltgun . **Biker:** Twin boltgun . **Vanguard Veteran:** Bolt Pistol, Power sword . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Stalker Pattern Boltgun **Veterans [15 PL, 248pts]** . **Black Shield:** Power sword, Storm shield . **Vanguard Veteran:** Lightning Claw (Pair) . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Storm Bolter . **Veteran:** Chainsword, Storm Bolter . **Veteran w/ Heavy Weapon:** Deathwatch Frag Cannon . **Veteran w/ Heavy Weapon:** Deathwatch Frag Cannon . **Veteran w/ Heavy Weapon:** Deathwatch Frag Cannon . **Watch Sergeant:** Plasma pistol, Xenophase Blade **+ Flyer +** **Corvus Blackstar [12 PL, 257pts]:** Auspex Array, Hurricane bolter, Twin lascannon . **2x Stormstrike Missile Launchers:** 2x Stormstrike missile launcher **++ Total: [118 PL, 1999pts] ++** The idea is to start the 2 frag cannon vet squads in the Corvus with the Watch Master joining the 8 man squad. The stalker vets are there to camp backfield objectives and the primaris to hold midfield. I will also combat squad the 1 stalker vet squad into 4 bikes + vanguard. These are my objective grabbers if i need to get somewhere quick. The master crafted boltgun captains stick towards the back. Im not a huge fan of mixed primaris squads but everything else is fair game. Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Process for Collecting?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-13 11:01:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>To all you experienced hobbyists out there.... We all love "plastic crack" and so often i find myself building armies very ad hoc with units that i like the look of or want to try on the table. Out of maybe 5-6 armies i collect only space marines and my Admech are at a point where i can happily change up my 2000 pt lists and them not be samey. So when you guys (and gals) decide to collect a new army do you have a process you go through to purchase the models? Do you sit down and right out what your going to buy in what order - eg. Hq and troops first, then this unit and that unit. Is it governed by the games you play with what you have and what you feel you need. Or do you just splurge on the whole list and build from there. I ask as it would be great if I could get some of my armies to a playable point without getting distracted by my addiction</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-14 13:47:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm getting bored of my Crimson Fists and have always loved the look and fluff of the Deathwatch. I'm pretty sure I will be building out a 2,000 point force soon (probably double battalion with 2x Corvus) but for the time being im going to proxy and get to grips with them I'm not a fan of the idea of mixed primaris squads but love the intercessor models so will probably go with 2 min sized squads, along with 2x 5 man stalker squads of vets. I'm really looking for advice on loadout for 10man vet squads, at the moment im thinking of running them like so: - Watch Sergeant w/ Stormbolter + Powersword - Black Shield w/ Powersword + Stormshield - 3x Vets w/ Fragcannon - 4x Vets w/ Chainsword + Stormbolter - Vanguard Vet w/ Lightning claws What do we think, is this a good loadout or are 3 fragcannons to much?</TEXT>

The writing on the nemesis strikes me as very deathwatch and I love the main body of a redemptor. - Do you think this could work, like would it be the right height / scale? - How would you model 2x Stormcannon arrays?

    <TEXT>I understand wanting to use D amp;D system, for me it #8217;s a much more enjoyable system. Don #8217;t get me wrong I enjoy dark heresy / only war / rogue trader but it seems D amp;D is more customisable to the exact nature of character and campaign. That being said I think it #8217;s really easy to stick 40k to D amp;D system. In 5th (think in the DM manual) there is a section for futuristic campaigns. For example terminator armour could be full plate, power armour could be breastplate etc. Use the system but just change the names of spells / skills / gear etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I prefer the right one. The white helmet and Aquila break the model up a bit. Otherwise it #8217;s just black</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Warboss base size. 60mm too big?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-30 21:35:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just a quick question. Looking to get into orks as I #8217;m loving the new buggies and kulturs, and I #8217;ve had a AOS Warboss for a while, which is on a 60mm base. Is this too big to play as a 40k Warboss? I #8217;ve seen some massive Warbosses around and just wondering what #8217;s the limit</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do it! That would look awesome. Fluff wise there isn #8217;t much the deathwatch won #8217;t use, even if they hate using it. Stick a necromancy head on the base and the fluff can be they are in a campaign fighting the crowns and he got the shield then</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I could probably get him on a 50mm, think 40mm will be a push. Is there really any issue with slightly larger base?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most DW players pick up the Corvus pretty quick. One thing I always want but pass up for better units is the landraider. If someone got me one I would be stoked. Think it would be awesome to do in DW colours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As everyone has said any traitor marines would be black shields. But the idea of painting the poldron in the traitors scheme and then scratch it up, enough that it looks like it #8217;s been scratched off but leave some of the colour remaining</TEXT>
