    <TEXT>Think about it logically: luffydude said that SCMP should be banned for acting as a propaganda mouthpiece of an authoritarian government with a well-known track record of human rights violations. You responded with an attack on the credibility of the western free press, citing its failures of wartime reporting. You just tried to use the shortcomings of the sensationalist western free press to defend a concerted effort by an authoritarian power to advance its narrative by vilifying those who oppose it. If that's not whataboutism then I don't know what is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\ gt;implying SCMP isn't CCP propaganda Yet if you'll take a few minutes to read through some of the articles, you'll find that it constantly takes an obviously critical tone of the protestors and their cause, and tries to portray them all as a danger to Hong Kong society \ gt;there is no sensationalist free press. Just ignore the fact that sensational reporting is the primary method for news outlets to get readers. But you're still semi-correct, as there is no such thing in China. \ gt;The press isn't sensationalist about US imperialism-- The western press WOULD be sensationalist about "US imperialism" if any of their readers cared about it. They do not. \ gt;I #8217;m sorry you had to hear it from me, but it #8217;s public knowledge that the major media outlets consult with the US State Dept. to ensure their articles  #8220;comply with national security objectives #8221;. Not to mention that the people who own these media outlets are the same people that (1) financially benefit from American wars abroad, usually as stockholders, and (2) are the ones most influential in deciding who gets to run for election. Not to mention that they have a track record of blatantly lying when it comes to America #8217;s enemies and rolling it back post-facto  #8212; once the damage is done, of course. Why are you trying this hard to discredit the American free press? Do you honestly think that dragging it down will boost China's press credibility? Because no matter how dirty the American media gets, it will never stoop down to the sycophantic "reporting" that is Chinese media.</TEXT>

Things are now at the point where fighting back and risking far harsher consequences is a preferable alternative to being arrested and shipped to who-knows-where and having-who-knows what done to them. If they don't want to end up like the Falun Gong and mainland political activists, they are forced to resist in any manner possible. Their freedoms and the future of democratic Hong Kong are at stake. But according to you, they're just the same as petty thieves and murderers.

    <TEXT>You simp out when women with looser vaginas get attacked for their perceived sexuality yet dont hesitate to attack men for their perceived lack of sexual prowess, calling me a loser virgin for going against the narrative, calling another guy small dicked for suggesting that promiscuous women *might* just be a bit different, all the while spending the last two hours defending the sanctity of m #8217;lady #8217;s pussy. I think its pretty obvious to anyone that you #8217;re a hypocritical lying simp whos worshipping women and bashing men just to get a crumb of m #8217;lady #8217;s coochie.

    <TEXT>You sound more and more like you don't even have the slightest clue of what an incel is. Incel is literally a portmanteau of "involuntarily celibate", yet you're saying I'm involuntarily celibate for using meme terminology common to young men of my age? Guess that means all of us zoomers on tiktok are incels despite not even being celibate. The only way I could be projecting is if I was a simp who spends hours of my time on reddit arguing about women #8217;s pussies with internet strangers, but evidently I am not. Given the way you used  #8220;incel #8221; I am not at all convinced that you understand what projection is. That makes two buzzwords you used incorrectly. Last but not least you even threw in some completely irrelevant incel strawman. I hate to break it to you but you are literally the embodiment of the incoherent, incompetent, buzz-word using, pussy worshipping soyboy meme. Never become the incoherent, incompetent, buzz-word using, pussy worshipping soyboy meme.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I must say I am sorry that I was not able to dumb down my argument enough for you to understand that there is no projection to point out if there was no projection in the first place. Also, the difference between you and me is that I tried to apply my words as true to their definitions as possible. If you reflect on your actions and actually look up the definitions of my words, you'll find that they fit you quite well. The same cannot be said about you and your wanton use of inappropriate buzzwords. Trying to compare my words to yours is false equivalency. My arguments are only as sound as the minds that receive it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bruh. Were you whiteknighting on this thread so hard that you forgot my arguments as soon as you read them? I think I #8217;ve made it clear twice now that you #8217;re a hypocrite who holds double standards when it comes to body/slut shaming. On this thread, you #8217;ve tirelessly argued against the body shaming and slut shaming of women, yet you do just that to men in the same thread, calling them small dicked, calling me a loser virgin and making small dick jokes. And what was it you said earlier?  #8220;Small penis jokes are not ok #8221;. So on top of a hypocrite you #8217;re a shameless liar. Why the fuck should anyone in this thread care about your opinion if you practice the opposite of what you preach? If you still don #8217;t understand why you #8217;re in the wrong you might as well quit the internet.</TEXT>

Well, if herbivore men are made up of voluntary celibates, then what kind of people are involuntary celibates? \ gt;weird nazis are involuntary celibates So I take it that the kind of people who are involuntary celibates are weird nazis? "But-but-but I'm just saying weird nazis are involuntary celibates!!!111!!1 I am by no means implying that all involuntary celibates are weird nazis!!11111" Except you didn't say "extremely ugly people are involuntary celibates" or "extremely mentally ill people are involuntary celibates". You said "weird nazis are involuntary celibates", as if the presence of nazis in the set is a defining indicator for the types of people who are involuntary celibates. "Even if they aren't nazis, they're just as bad in a different way". Don't even try to pretend you don't know what you're doing. Either you have no idea what you're talking about, or your argument itself is a bad faith argument. Your call.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My paraphrasing and argument made it VERY CLEAR that I interpreted your argument as "incels are made up of people who are nazis or hated as much as nazis", something that has been validated by your definition of what involuntary celibates is. I think we're getting nowhere because you haven't the faintest idea what "involuntary celibate" means. When you say incels are abhorrent (and how you associate incels with nazis), I take that to mean "having beliefs and actions that are reprehensible to basic sensibilities". Do you know what "involuntary" means? It means having no control over some condition or situation. Do you know what people have control over? Their beliefs and actions. If holding these beliefs is what deprives them of sex, but they elect to continue holding these beliefs, then their celibacy in completely voluntary. That being said, the only way someone could be considered involuntarily celibate is if they were born with disadvantageous traits that they are unable to alter, like extreme ugliness, deformity or mental illness, traits that have been proven by science and common fucking science to decimate the likelihood of your dick getting wet. Do you get it now? Your interpretation of involuntary celibate is completely at odds with even the words in "involuntary celibate". Try opening a dictionary instead of trying to lecture others on set theory. That being said, I have one final question: If holding abhorrent views like neo-nazism prevents other people from having sex with you, then how have racists, neo-nazis, lynchers been having sex and having families up until now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\ gt;Nope, not validated. Simple subset, again, you trapped yourself with your own statement. Deny, deny, deny, but fail to elaborate while giving vague answers. Kinda reminds you of a certain orange-faced world leader, doesn't it? \ gt;No, people don #8217;t often control beliefs, those are ingrained during formative years. They #8217;re not even dependent on logic, they #8217;re emotional attachments. It takes serious outreach to even attempt deprograming some seriously caustic beliefs. Two things: 1.You'd think that, if a competent, functioning adult were to be rejected multiple times solely for holding extremely distasteful views (and not height, race, face, wealth, etc), they'd elect to suppress these beliefs when they interact with women in order to get pussy. If they can't make the effort to, then they're voluntarily consigning themselves to celibacy. The only way to be involuntarily celibate in this situation is to either be so autistic or so lacking in emphatic awareness that they repeatedly fail to notice other peoples' reactions, or they are too intellectually limited to comprehend the situation. 2. But what if they were raised in such a close-minded and toxic environment where they never ever question the caustic beliefs that they hold? Because the very environment they live in constantly reinforces these beliefs, these beliefs are the unquestionable "normal" for them. How do they escape involuntary celibacy due to their beliefs in this environment? Answer: they don't, because they weren't involuntarily celibate due to their beliefs to begin with. If they were raised in a community where abhorrent beliefs were the norm, then others must also hold these beliefs as a norm, which means these beliefs would certainly be a nonfactor when it comes to sex. But surely this is just limited to communities in the backwards American south, right? Surely in the rest of the U.S. any man who'd espouse beliefs like nazism would be involuntarily celibate! Two problems: If you're really missing out on pussy that bad for your beliefs you could just move to communities with like minded individuals. If you don't make an effort to do so you're voluntarily, not involuntarily celibate. EXCEPT being involuntarily celibate due to your beliefs means that the overwhelming majority of women find these distasteful beliefs a major repulsive factor when it comes to having sex, to the point where you can't find a single woman who tolerates these beliefs. Unfortunately, not only is there no scientific evidence that shows this is the case, there is extensive evidence that shows, across many different demographics, that significant amounts of women either don't care, tolerate, or even espouse the racist beliefs associated with white supremacy and nazism. Should you wish, I can compile them for you (there is simply to much to link). I am sorry to say this, but Reddit's twisted perversion of the definition of "involuntary celibacy" is just a sick just world fallacy circlejerk. Call me anything you want, but I refuse to participate in this circle jerk. You should too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Except the way they said it its almost if weird nazis are somehow representative of involuntary celibates, ie "the kind of people who are involuntarily celibate are weird nazis and such". As a matter of fact, if you go further down in a parallel thread you'll find that their definition of "involuntary celibate" is literally a nazi or someone who holds similar abhorrent views. Now comments like these might be funny and all, but for true involuntary celibates attitudes like these only further their insecurities and self-hatred.</TEXT>

Time and time again I have emphasized that by only associating nazis with involuntary celibates you suggest that all incels are similar unsavory characters or worse, a belief that YOU confirmed.

Repugnance is an all around quality that characterizes incels. Thats undoubtedly true...physical repugnance, that is. It also seems that you want to abandon pure conjecture and start fighting with facts. You asked for it. On the indisputable importance of appearance as well as personality being a non-factor in initial attractiveness (getting a quick fuck) Within races, the inter-rater agreement on physical attractiveness is very high, typically [Cronbach's  #945;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha) \ gt; .9. Across races it is only slightly lower. There is lots of variance in ratings of averagely looking people (SD of \~2-3 on a 10-point scale), but very little variance in ratings of very attractive or very unattractive people, i.e. people strongly agree about the extremes.

The adolescents upon whom parents were reporting were predominantly Caucasian (89.3%) males (86.8%) aged 12 #8211;18 with a median age of 14 years (M = 14.51, SD = 1.96). Findings were: * 69.2% of adolescents with high functioning autism expressed the desire for a dating relationship. * 73.1% with high functioning autism expressed attraction to someone of the opposite sex, and 10.0% to the same sex. * However, only 7.7% of this high functioning autistic cohort reported having had a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, and 1.5% with someone of the same sex. * Only 1.5% of the group had sex. For comparison, around 35% of overall teens (ages 13-17) have some experience with romantic relationships ([HSS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-development/healthy-relationships/dating/index.html)). Autistic adolescents showed a typical amount of desire for sexual relationships, but a disproportionately low capacity to achieve them. A limitation in deriving figures about the teenager sex lives from parent reports is that teenagers do not disclose all of their activities. However, a survey showed, among teens and young adults 15-21 who reported having vaginal sex, 91% of their parents were aware of this ([source](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2914/1322/5667/NationalPoll_09-14_V2_1.pdf)). **References:** * Holmes LG, Himle MB. 2014. *Brief Report: Parent-Child Sexuality Communication and Autism Spectrum Disorders.* Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. 44(11): 2964 #8211;2970. \[[Abstract](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-014-2146-2)\] \[[FullText](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262581068_Brief_Report_Parent-Child_Sexuality_Communication_and_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders)\] ### 44.6% of high functioning adult autistic men remain virgins, despite high sex/relationship drive[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=21) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=21)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#44.6.25_of_high_functioning_adult_autistic_men_remain_virgins.2C_despite_high_sex.2Frelationship_drive) | [category: Mental](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocMental) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#toc44.6.25_of_high_functioning_adult_autistic_men_remain_virgins.2C_despite_high_sex.2Frelationship_drive) A group of high functioning [autistic](https://incels.wiki/w/Asperger%27s_Syndrome) men and women was evaluated and compared with healthy controls to assess their sexual and relationship desires and success/failure to achieve those desires. 44.6% of autistic men were found to still virgins among a sample, with the average age being 35.7 years. Autistic men masturbated more and have a greater desire for a relationship than normal neurotypical (NT) men in the sample. However, only 16% of autistic men were in a relationship, while 82% of NT men were in a relationship. NT men were 5x more likely to be in a relationship than their [autistic](https://incels.wiki/w/Asperger%27s_Syndrome) counterparts. Autism did not so significantly reduce women's ability to find relationships with men, as 46% of women were able to have relationships, while only 16% of men were. **Discussion:** The lower sexual success of [autistic men](https://incels.wiki/w/Asperger%27s_Syndrome) as compared to women may be since autism reduces an individual's capacity for emotional interaction, but normal men crave emotional interaction less than normal women, so this will disproportionately impair an autistic man's attempts to find a relationship vs. an autistic woman's. It could also be that autistic men are more likely to be shunned then autistic women, either because the behavioral traits of autism are less apparent in females compared to males inherently, or autistic women are more effective at 'masking' their autism and behaving in a Neurotypical fashion compared to autistic males. These women are also likely seen as having an inherent social value due to their innate [reproductive resources](https://incels.wiki/w/Reproductive_success) that autistic men do not have. Due to women's tendency towards a passive courtship style, it would also be significantly easier for an autistic woman to enter into a relationship as men are expected to initiate courtship (at least formally) and actively pursue the woman. Men are also generally much less sexually selective than women across a variety of traits, so one would expect neurotypicality and emotional expressiveness to be an aspect of this. Autistic women may also be perceived as being easier to control and even exploit by potential male partners, with Sedgwick et al. (2019) finding that autistic women reported greater experiences of exploitation in their sexual relationships than the Neurotypical (NT) women examined by the researchers. Interestingly enough, in this study, autistic women were equally as likely to be married, in a relationship, or have children compared to the Neurotypical women examined. Autistic men also exhibited a greater number of paraphilias, which are considered "socially taboo." These paraphilias which appear to be part of their disease state would likely further compound their difficulties in entering and maintaining romantic relationships. **Quotes:** * *Male ASD participants reported more frequent* [*masturbation*](https://incels.wiki/w/Masturbation) *than male healthy controls (HCs) (P  lt; 0.01).* * *ASD men reported a greater sexual desire for sexual intercourse than their HC counterparts (P  lt; 0.05, Table III).* * *Of the individuals with ASD, significantly more women (N = 18; 46.2%) than men (N = 9; 16.1%) were currently in a relationship* **References:** * Sch #246;ttle D, Briken P, T #252;scher O, Turner D. 2017. *Sexuality in autism: hypersexual and paraphilic behavior in women and men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.* Dialogues Clin Neurosci. 19(4): 381 #8211;393. \[[FullText](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/)\] * Sedgwick F, Crane L, Hill V, Pellicano E. 2019. *Friends and Lovers: The Relationships of Autistic and Neurotypical Women*.

    <TEXT>### And more on mental health(1): ### Autists are judged as awkward, less physically attractive and less approachable within seconds[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=22) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=22)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#Autists_are_judged_as_awkward.2C_less_physically_attractive_and_less_approachable_within_seconds) | [category: Mental](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocMental) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocAutists_are_judged_as_awkward.2C_less_physically_attractive_and_less_approachable_within_seconds) Sasson et al. (2017) conducted a series of studies with a similar methodology consisting of groups of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and NT (Neurotypical) peers in various modes of social interaction consisting of 'thin slices.' The study discussed here consisted of forty adults (20 ASD; 20 NT;17 males each group) participants. The participants were comparable in IQ as measured by the WASI test ([Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale#WASI-II)) and age. The participants were made to record a 60-second mock audition for a fictional reality television program, which was edited by the researchers into five presentation modalities: (1) audio-only (2) visual-only (3) audio-visual (4) static image and (5) transcript of speech content. These recordings allowed the researchers to examine which elements of the participant's presentation styles contributed to the first impressions of observers. The participants were then rated by a group of volunteers (who were not informed of the clinical diagnoses of the ASD participants). This evaluation took place in the form of an online survey. Each stimulus was rated one at a time on ten items using a four-point scale (0 #8211;3), on several socially desirable traits that are accurately assessed at first acquaintance: attractiveness, awkwardness, intelligence, likeability, trustworthiness, and dominance. The researchers discovered that ASD participants were perceived more negatively on a number of the socially desirable traits examined, including attractiveness, likability, and dominance. A later study (Alkhaldi, Sheppard  amp; Mitchell, 2019) partially replicated the findings of the previous study. This study helped to elucidate further the possible casual factors behind this negative evaluation of ASD individuals. The pre-recorded video responses of autistic and NT participants (N = 40, 20 ASD, and 20 NT) to various stimuli of the subjects interacting with researchers (compliment, joke, story, waiting) were recorded. These video clips were evaluated by 31 typically developing perceivers (10 males and 21 females, and the researchers found that ASD individuals were perceived less favorably on several dimensions. The researchers also performed a second study, which replicated the results of the prior study. The participants were informed which scenario each of the participants in the study was experiencing. Which was to help the participants conceptualize the behavior they were observing. Perceiver ratings were utilized by the researchers to calculate a "readability" score (how easy it was to perceive the participant's emotional and affective states). The researchers found that throughout two studies, the readability score correlated moderately to strongly (r #8201;= #8201;0.58 for the first study and 0.63 for the second) with the negative or positive evaluations of the target's characteristics. Thus the negative perceptions of autistic individuals are possibly mediated by the observers' difficulty in reading their emotions or intentions. The researchers stated this could either be because this unreadability was associated with perceptions of lower trustworthiness. It could also simply be this unreadability is associated with behaving in a manner that is perceived as eccentric or "out of the ordinary," resulting in the greater negative perceptions of them. Trevisan et al. (2018) conducted a meta-analysis on facial expressiveness in autists. They found autists have little difficulties producing simple expressions such as smiles, frowns, and expressions of disgusts. However, autists tend to have inappropriate expressions at times and do not copy other's facial expressions subconsciously, giving the impression of being absent-minded and of low (affective) empathy. They also have more difficulties in spontaneously producing facial expressions and fewer difficulties when they are prompted to produce a particular facial expression. High IQ autists may be able to compensate for their lack of facial expressiveness to some extent, as emotional recognition is related to general intelligence, especially with more experience in social interactions and higher age.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And more on mental health(2): **Discussion:** This finding also brings into question the often-touted claim that autists fail socially primarily because they cannot read social cues and accidentally offend people. Autists do not score lower in some components of empathy, in some even higher than [neurotypicals](https://incels.wiki/w/Neurotypical) (Song 2019). Emotional expressiveness may have evolved due to the necessity for social organization in groups of humans. Proper expression of emotion is crucial for navigating and ascending social hierarchies; hence there is a selection pressure for sexual preferences to avoid non-[neurotypical](https://incels.wiki/w/Neurotypical) individuals. Such non-neurotypicals may also tend to be ineffective coalition partners. Further, atypical behavior may have served as an indicator of neurodegenerative infectious diseases in the past, often enough that humans evolved a natural aversion. An alternative or additional explanation may be sexual selection: Geoffrey Miller's [*mating mind* hypothesis](https://incels.wiki/w/Fisherian_runaway#Behavior) of human intelligence suggests that higher cognition and much of human behavior may have evolved as "cognitive ornament" though [positive-feedback processes](https://incels.wiki/w/Fisherian_runaway) in sexual selection. Such runaway selection predicts not only an exaggerated ornament but also a highly narrowed and exaggerated preference for such ornament. This evolutionary selection pressure may suggest the struggles high-functioning autists face may, in part, be rooted in social exclusion. This exclusion seems partially based on sexually selected preferences for highly specific modes of facial and emotional expressiveness . People strongly judge based on subtle cues of physical appearance despite them being mostly unrelated to health and ability. This superficiality in judgment may be evidence of a *few millimeters of emotional expressiveness* and [charisma](https://incels.wiki/w/Charisma) in analogy to [a few millimeters of bone](https://incels.wiki/w/A_few_millimeters_of_bone) that contribute to social and sexual exclusion. The natural aversion to subtle differences in emotional expressiveness may also be a driver of racism as each race may more attuned to particular cognitive ornament specific to their race. For example, Albert Einstein perceived the Northeast Asians as [obtuse](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/12/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-shocking-xenophobia) in one of his travel diaries. **Quotes:** * *Our findings show that negative first impressions of adults with ASD occurred only when audio and/or visual information was present, and not when the transcript of their speech content was evaluated. This discrepancy suggests that social presentation style rather than the substantive content of social speech drove negative impression formation of individuals with ASD.* * *Supporting this conclusion, a static image was sufficient for generating negative first impressions of those with ASD and including additional information, such as body movement or voice, did not worsen them further.* * *However, negative impressions did not occur for all evaluated traits, with the two groups not differing on ratings of perceived intelligence or trustworthiness.* * *In turn, this may limit opportunities in ASD for developing social connections and friendships, as well as the intergroup contact necessary for mitigating negative biases when present.* * *Based on evidence in the literature and the data presented here, we propose that negative first impressions of ASD are not founded on any one feature of expression, but rather represent an effect of subtle physical, dynamic, and auditory cues of presentation that can also include additional features, such as clothing choices, grooming habits, gaze patterns, or body posture.* * *Target readability correlated with ratings of target favorability (r #8201;= #8201;.58 and r #8201;= #8201;.63), independent of target diagnosis. Perceivers might rate targets unfavorably because they experience difficulty reading them, though other interpretations of the correlation are also possible.*(Alkhaldi et al. 2019) * *If being unreadable is associated with being rated socially unfavorable, as suggested by our findings, it could, in turn, have very negative consequences for the development of autistic individuals. This follows if being perceived unfavorably is a barrier to inclusion in the social world, where autistic people, who are in the population minority, instead are condemned to isolation.* (Alkhaldi et al. 2019) **References:** * Sasson NJ.

    <TEXT>And even more on mental health: ### Cluster-B personality disorders lead to 3.5x as many sexual partners and more offspring[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=26) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=26)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#Cluster-B_personality_disorders_lead_to_3.5x_as_many_sexual_partners_and_more_offspring) | [category: Mental](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocMental) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocCluster-B_personality_disorders_lead_to_3.5x_as_many_sexual_partners_and_more_offspring) Guiti #233;rrez et al. (2013) conducted a study to determine if the various personality disorder clusters #8212;Type A (Schizoid, Odd), Type B (Narcissistic, Anti-social) and Type C (Avoidant, OCD) #8212;were solely detrimental in terms of life outcomes for the individuals with these personality disorders (PDs), or if they instead presented their sufferers with various potentially adaptive benefits, such as more plentiful sexual and social opportunities. A sample of psychiatric outpatients (N = 738, 53% female, mean age 34.1 yrs, SD 10.9) were presented with a questionnaire designed to measure the presence and intensity of the ten personality disorders. A further questionnaire designed to broadly measure various life outcomes such as number of sexual partners, employment, income, and health was also administered. A multiple linear regression performed by the researchers on the data was used by the authors to estimate the contribution of the PD scores to various life outcomes. While finding that in general, PDs were resulting in more negative life outcomes broadly, there were some evolutionary adaptive benefits that seemed to accrue to bearers of these disorders. Namely, those individuals high in type-B personality cluster traits (Narcissism, Anti-Social, Borderline, Histrionic) of both sexes have 3.5x as many sexual partners as low B subjects, with five times as many short-term mates and twice as many long term mates. The researchers also found that those higher in cluster B had 39% more children than those lower in cluster B traits. **Discussion:** It can be surmised that these personality traits, with all their concomitant adverse outcomes, both for the bearers of these disorders and their potential victims, are most likely being significantly sexually selected for in various modern societies. **Quotes:** * *PDs even brought some fitness advantages: Whereas reduced fertility in other mental disorders had been mainly attributed to lower marriage rates ... our high-PD subjects had 32% more mates.* * *The strength of these relationships should not be underestimated: Explained variance lies within the range of 1-5.7% usually found in phenotypic selection studies, in both humans and nonhumans.* * *Further supporting a sexual selection scenario, our high-B subjects out-reproduced low-B by 39%.* * *Likewise, high status, a strong priority for high-C subjects, has often been related in post-industrial societies to quality- rather then quantity-based mating and reproduction.* * *In the literature however, Cluster A disorders are not reported to be completely detrimental. For example, A subjects have been found to spend more time in romantic relationships and to have more frequent or earlier parenthood. Likewise, some components of schizotypy seem to increase mating success ... more data on A traits are clearly needed.* **References:** * Guti #233;rrez F, G #225;rriz M, Peri JM, Ferraz L, Sol D, Navarro JB, Barbadilla A, Vald #233;s M. 2013. *Fitness costs and benefits of personality disorder traits.* Evolution and Human Behavior. 34(1): 41-48. \[[Abstract](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513812000906?via%3Dihub)\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>### And even more on mental health and appearance: ### People accurately perceive a man's mental health from facial appearance alone[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=28) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=28)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#People_accurately_perceive_a_man.27s_mental_health_from_facial_appearance_alone) | [category: Mental](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocMental) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocPeople_accurately_perceive_a_man.27s_mental_health_from_facial_appearance_alone) Ward  amp; Scott (2018) constructed composite images from young White men with the "most extreme scores" on three separate mental health inventories relating to depression, schizotypy, and Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The purpose of the study was to determine if an individual can accurately gauge other individual's mental health in a first impression scenario. The male subjects were instructed to maintain a neutral facial expression while being photographed, and care was taken to ensure that the men in the photos had no unique distinguishing features related to self-adornment (e.g., jewelry, glasses, beards), that might bias results. These three disorders were partly chosen because of the differences in the symptoms and pathology between them, and because the traits related to these disorders are also present to a greater or lesser extent in sub-clinical (below the diagnostic threshold for the condition) populations. Two hundred fifty-three observers (Women N = 173, Men N = 73, "not reported" N = 7) rated the composite photos in regards to their perceptions of the subjects in the photograph's mental health, masculinity, and attractiveness. An additional group of observers were recruited to rate physical health (N = 50). The images were presented in a fashion that ensured that each observer-rated every composite image only once for a single parameter (i.e., mental health, attractiveness, etc.) This was to avoid halo effects and other biases that would potentially distort the mean ratings of the images. Observers were also instructed to rate occluded images of the stimuli, such as the inner facial features only and the eyes only. It was found that perceived mental health accurately reflected actual mental health. While physical attractiveness, perceived health, and facial masculinity or the combination thereof of these traits influenced observer's judgment of the stimuli, this did not fully explain the relationship that was found between actual mental health and perceived mental health at first impression, which was stated to be robust. This suggests that there are cues of mental health that are mostly unrelated to physical attractiveness. The researchers suggested that the observers may be picking up a general risk factor or "p factor" in the physical aspect of the composite images, which is proposed to be a risk factor for various mental disorders. This factor appears strongly related to the big-five personality trait neuroticism, also said to be a general underlying factor that is associated with various types of mental disorders. The ability to perceive mental disorders through facial appearance was hypothesized to be related to signaling theory; specifically, the researchers speculated that is in the organism's favor to generally send "honest signals" of various traits, (even socially undesirable ones). This is because the threat of a false signal being discovered to be false can lead to the signaller being punished for their "deceit" in sending a false signal to others. So even though it would likely be maladaptive for the mentally ill to honestly signal their disorders in such a fashion, at the population level, this would be potentially out-weighted by the benefits of honest signals concerning more favored traits. The researchers stated that this finding also implies that those who suffer from mental health disorders are at risk of being trapped in a "vicious cycle" where their accurately perceived mental health cause others to shun and exclude them, and otherwise induce adverse reactions in observers, and this social isolation and mistreatment results in worsened mental health. The researchers suggested that possible effects of physical appearance, in regards to the etiology and strengthening of mental disorders represented a mostly unexplored element of psychology. **Quotes** * *Observers could accurately estimate the mental health status of men in neutral facial composites: perceived mental health reflected actual mental health. Furthermore, this accuracy could not be fully explained by attractiveness, physical health, masculinity, or their combination.* * *As we reviewed earlier, trait Neuroticism is associated with numerous mental health disorders, including those we tested, and it is identifiable in similar facial appearance paradigms.* * *Unfavorable observer response brings us to our final point. As we have argued elsewhere (Scott et al., 2015), the fact that mental health status can be cued to observers in the absence of behavior, raises the possibility of a vicious cycle in which those at greatest risk of mental health problems may be continuously and involuntarily broadcasting a message which is producing negative reactions in observers (Coyne, 1976).* * *At present then, our view is that there is a relatively unappreciated and unexplored potential risk factor of appearance for the development of mental health disorders.* **References:** * Ward R, Scott NJ. 2018. *Cues to mental health from men #8217;s facial appearance.* Journal of Research in Personality, 75:26 #8211;36. \[[Abstract](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618300394)\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Racism in dating: ## Women are more racist in online dating, and 92-95% with a "preference" exclude any ethnic men[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=30) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=30)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#Women_are_more_racist_in_online_dating.2C_and_92-95.25_with_a_.22preference.22_exclude_any_ethnic_men) | [category: Race](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocRace) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocWomen_are_more_racist_in_online_dating.2C_and_92-95.25_with_a_.22preference.22_exclude_any_ethnic_men) Yahoo Personals Dating Preferences Study sought to examine the dating preferences of online daters in four major metropolitan areas: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta. Internet daters' profiles of self-identified Asian, Black, Latino, and White men and women seeking opposite-sex dates were collected and coded from Yahoo Personals, which was the most popular national online dating web site in 2004 and 2005. Women were considerably more likely than men to state they had a "racial preference". 74% of the 2735 women voiced a "racial preference", while 58% of the 2872 men voiced a "racial preference". Among those women with a racial preference: * When considering a man of a different race from their own: 95% excluded Indian men, 94% excluded middle eastern men, 92% excluded Asian men, 87% excluded black men, 69% excluded Latino men, and 42% excluded white men. * The women who only wanted to date men of their own race were: 65% of white women, 45% of black women, 16.5% of Latino women, and 6% of Asian women. * The women who excluded their own race were: 4% of white women, 8% of black women, 17% of Latino women, and 40% of Asian women. Thus we can see that among this group, women employed a racial hierarchy for men in interracial dating of: **White  gt; Latino  gt; Black  gt; Asian  gt; Middle Eastern  gt; Indian**. White women were the least likely to exclude their own race (4%) and most likely to only want their own race (65%). Asian women were most likely to exclude their own race (40%) and least likely to only want their own race (6%). Women's interracial rejection rates of men were as follows: * East Indian (95%)  gt; Middle Eastern (94%)  gt; Asian (92%)  gt; Black (87%)  gt; Latino (69%)  gt; White (42%) ## All races agree that whites are most attractive, but women prefer whites far more than men[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=31) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=31)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#All_races_agree_that_whites_are_most_attractive.2C_but_women_prefer_whites_far_more_than_men) | [category: Race](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocRace) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocAll_races_agree_that_whites_are_most_attractive.2C_but_women_prefer_whites_far_more_than_men) OKCupid's data is a convenient source for analyzing sexual preferences as it asks users to fill out quizzes and personality tests with the self-interest to find a good partner and hence possibly less tarnished by [virtue signaling](https://incels.wiki/w/Virtue_signaling). One question asked was: "Not to be racist but which ethnicity do you find to be most attractive?" Analysis of responses showed all races of women reported they believed Whites to be superior in attractiveness to all other races (Zelvin 2009). Although men expressed a similar trend with their answers, it was less pronounced than it was for women. The largest gender differences were: **OkCupid user who found Whites the most attractive race**Ethnicity% women% menIndians67%42%Asians72%49%Middle Easterners79%54%Pacific Islanders71%39% Thus, although many women claim to oppose "White male privilege" or "White supremacy," it seems one of the greatest privileges White men are afforded is the overwhelming view from all races of women that they are the most attractive of all men.

The researchers found that while men did not show any strong race preferences, women of all races demonstrated significant racial biases. They found the greatest female racial bias was against Asian men, and this was also associated with a general consensus from all women that Asian men were the least physically attractive overall. Even Asian women found white, black, and Hispanic men to be more attractive than Asian men. As with most studies, white men were the most attractive to women overall. **Quotes:** * *Even in a population of relatively progressive individuals who have self-selected into participation in a multi-cultural Speed Dating event, we observe strong racial preferences.* * *Women of all races exhibit strong same race preferences, while men of no race exhibit a statistically significant same race preference.* * *The observed difference seems to reflect a genuine disparity in men #8217;s and women #8217;s willingness to be with a partner of a different race.* * *For male partners, Asians generally receive lower ratings than men of other races. In fact, when we run the regressions separately for each race, we find that even Asian women find white, black, and Hispanic men to be more attractive than Asian men.* * *Given that Asian men were the group that other races expressed strongest preference against, and that Asian women expressed the least preference against other races, the results suggest that attractiveness may play an important role in the determination of racial preferences.* **References:** * Iyengar S, Kamenica E, Simonson I. 2008. *Racial Preferences in Dating: Evidence from a Speed Dating Experiment.* Review of Economic Studies 75(1):117-132.\[[Abstract](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/researcharchive/articles/1367)\] * Tierney J. 2007. *Single Female Seeking Same-Race Male.* New York Times. \[[News](https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/single-female-seeking-same-race-male/)\] ### Asian women marry interracially more than twice as often as Asian men[[edit](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;veaction=edit amp;section=35) | [edit source](https://incels.wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_Blackpill amp;action=edit amp;section=35)] [permalink](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#Asian_women_marry_interracially_more_than_twice_as_often_as_Asian_men) | [category: Race](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocRace) | [table of contents](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#tocAsian_women_marry_interracially_more_than_twice_as_often_as_Asian_men) The 2010 Pew Research Center Report (U.S. Census Bureau #8217;s 2010 American Community Survey) investigated trends that year in interracial marriage. Their primary findings confirmed trends seen in other research which indicate Asian men are the least desirable to women, and black women are the least desirable to men. Overall, whites were also shown to be the least likely to interracially marry of any race. There were no gender differences in white/Hispanic interracial marriage rates overall. The primary date showed: * 9.4% of whites, 17.1% of blacks, 25.7% of Hispanics and 27.7% of Asians married someone whose race was different from their own. * 24% of black males married outside their race, compared with just 9% of black females. * 36% of Asian females married outside their race, compared with just 17% of Asian males. * There were no gender differences in intermarriage rates among whites and Hispanics. Of note, in the Yahoo Personals study reviewed above, 40% of Asian women who stated that they had a racial preference in dating excluded Asian men. Given that marriage data shows 36% of Asian women marry outside their race, it seems a large portion of Asian women don't just promise not to date Asian men, they follow through on it right to marriage. **Discussion:** This phenomenon may in part be explained by East Asian women's high degree of [neoteny](https://incels.wiki/w/Neoteny) acting as a super stimulus to males of other races. **References:** * Taylor P, Wang W, Parker K, Passel JS, Patten E, Motel S. 2012. *The Rise of Intermarriage: Rates, Characteristics Vary by Race and Gender.* Pew Social  amp; Demographic Trends. \[[FullText](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/02/SDT-Intermarriage-II.pdf)\] ###</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even more on racism: ## Asian men have half the relationships as white men due to women's 'racial hierarchy' Data from the data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) was evaluated to examine romantic and sexual involvement among young adults, most of who were between the ages of 25 to 32 (N = 11,555). Overall, white men had the highest odds of being in a relationship, followed in order by Hispanic, black and Asian men. In fact, it was found that Asian men were half as likely as white men to be currently involved with a romantic partner, even after controlling for a wide array of characteristics. Asian women by contrast did not suffer any reduced odds of being in a relationship compared to white women. Researchers concluded that the dramatically lower odds of an Asian man finding a relationship are due to the racial hierarchies women employ in judging men. **Quotes:** * *Asian women were half as likely as Asian men to be unpartnered (i.e., 18% versus 35%).* * *Asian men, but not black or Hispanic men, exhibit significantly lower odds of involvement than white men. Specifically, they have roughly half the odds of current involvement as white men.* * *We found no evidence that socioeconomic resources or physical characteristics were driving the lower levels of involvement among Asian men. Instead, our findings are consistent with the notion that Asian American men are at the bottom of the racial hierarchy when it comes to the different-sex dating market.* * *If  #8220;Asian cultural values #8221; account for differences in romantic partnership formation, we would have found similar patterns for Asian women as Asian men. In fact, the opposite was true.* * *Our results suggest that the racial hierarchy framework best explains lower likelihood of involvement among Asian American men.* * *A racial hierarchy explanation suggests that Asian American men will be less likely than Asian American women to be partnered, as Asian American men face gendered cultural stereotypes barring them from entry into romantic partnerships.* **References:** * Balistreri K, Joyner K, Kao G. 2015. *Relationship Involvement Among Young Adults: Are Asian American Men an Exceptional Case?* Popul Res Policy Rev. 34(5): 709-732. \[[FullText](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/)\] ## White and Asian women agree white men are 30-50% more attractive than Asian men Burke et al. conducted a study to examine racial homophily in preferences for opposite sex faces. 120 university students took part in the study (N = 58 males, N = 62 females). Participants were further comprised of three different ethnic-cultural groups: Australian-Europeans, Australian East-Asians or Hong-Kong East-Asian. Participants rated 144 colorized photographs of subjects from three racial/ethnic groups: White South Africans, Black South Africans and 'primarily Korean Asian faces'. From these faces, several compound morphs of both single race and mixed race faces were created. It was found that the European faces were rated as the most attractive on average by participants from all the ancestries included in the study. It was found that contrary to previous studies, the mixed race faces were not rated as more attractive then single race compound faces, with the faces instead rated close to the mean level of the attractiveness of the two faces they were mixture of. It did not matter whether women were Australian East-Asian or Hong-Kong East-Asian, indicating that Asian female preference for white men is not regionally influenced, but rather consistent across entire continents. **Figures:** **Quotes:** * *Overall, these data do not show an obvious own-race preference, since the European faces were rated as most attractive by all participants.* * *For female participants there was a universal European face preference, and the Australian East Asian participants did not even rate own-race faces as second most attractive, instead rating African faces as equally attractive (for individual faces) or slightly more attractive (for compound faces) than East Asian faces.* **References:** * Burke D, Nolan C, Hayward WG, Russell R, Sulikowski D. 2013. *Is There an Own-Race Preference in Attractiveness?* Evolutionary Psychology. 11(4): 855-872. \[[Abstract](https://doi.org/10.1177/147470491301100410)\] \[[FullText](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147470491301100410)\] ##</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Believe it or not, even more on racism: ## Across America, women most desire white men, followed by black, Hispanic, and Asian men Bruch  amp; Newman (2018) analyzed data from a free popular online dating site in four large American cities (New York, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle) to assess which factors people base their decisions on in online dating. They found women ranked men in a racial hierarchy of desirability as follows: *White  gt; black  gt; Hispanic  gt; Asian* This data was similar to the data reviewed previously in the Yahoo Personals study, only with a reversed position in the hierarchy for Hispanic and black men. Counteracting the common notion that whites are most desired in dating due to "Westernized" standards of [beauty](https://incels.wiki/w/Beauty), men found Asian women most attractive in this same study, more so even than white women. Although both Asian men and women would be equally subject to "Western" beauty standards, Asians were still viewed at opposite ends of attractiveness by gender, with Asian men the least desired by women and Asian women the most desired by men. **Quotes:** * *In keeping with previous work, there is also a clear and consistent dependence on ethnicity, with Asian women and white men being the most desirable potential mates by our measures across all four cities.* **References:** * Bruch E, Newman MEJ. 2018. *Aspirational pursuit of mates in online dating markets.* Science Advances 4(8):eaap9815. \[[FullText](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/8/eaap9815/tab-figures-data)\] ## Women enforce stricter racial requirements than men, advantaging primarily white men Lin and Lundquist (2013) found evidence of a strong racial hierarchy in women's dating preferences, and evidence for stronger racial homophily (preferring the same race as themselves) in dating, among women. The study utilized data from American dating and social networking websites, with a large final sample of N = 528,000 men and N = 405,021 women who resided in the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. This sample was also more racially diverse than many of the samples found in other online dating studies, with 53.07% of the women sampled being white and 52.05% of the men sampled being white. It was found that black women generally displayed the strongest racial homophily, Hispanic women showed a weaker level of racial homophily than black women, showing a preference for their own race and whites, white women displayed strong racial homophily and a small preference for Hispanics, and Asian women showed a preference for both their own race and white men. Thus white men were the most likely to be contacted by women in general. Measuring response rates, it became clear Asian women displayed a strong preference for white men, and secondly Asian men. Black women also displayed a preference for white men, but were fairly equal in their responses. Hispanic women's response behavior was comparable to Asian women. White women displayed strong racial homophily in their responses, with their response behaviors differing little from their messaging behaviors. Analyzing the effect of education on response and messaging rates, it was demonstrated that the effect of race was far stronger then that of education in predicting response and messaging rates, e.g. it was found white women were more likely to response to a white man without a college degree then any of the other races of men with a college degree. The researchers outlined a racial hierarchy in dating for men as: White men at the top, Hispanic and Asian men in the middle, and Black men at the bottom. Therefore, in contradiction to surveys in which women state they have more open and tolerant attitudes towards interracial relationships then men, their actual actions show that they are much less willing to date out of their race than men, except for a tendency for many minority women to be open towards dating or actually preferring to date white men. **Quotes:** * *Stated from the men #8217;s perspective, white men have the best odds of being contacted by women even if all racial groups are equally represented on the dating website, largely because they are among the top choice groups for Asian, Hispanic, and white women. Asian and black men, on the other hand, receive messages only from their co ethnics.* * *Looking first at the responses of Asian women, it becomes clear that, when given a choice, Asian women are most likely to respond to white men, followed by Asian men. They are less likely to respond to Hispanic men or black men. Black women, by contrast, respond to daters who con-tact them fairly equally, with a preference for white men. The responding behavior of Hispanic women is comparable to that of Asian women. They are most responsive to white men, followed by their co-ethnics, and least responsive to black men. White women #8217;s reciprocal behaviors look little different from their sending behaviors. They respond predominantly to white men. In brief, black men are least likely to receive responses from anyone except black women, Hispanic and Asian men are somewhere in the middle, and white men enjoy the highest likelihood of response.* * *This tendency to privilege a man #8217;s whiteness over his achieved status is even more pronounced among non-college-educated women, who are even more likely to respond to white men #8217;s messages regardless of their level of education.* * *In this sense, racial boundaries function similarly to one-way turnstile gates. While non black daters, particularly white men, are well received when they contact daters of other groups, black daters, particularly black women, are largely confined to a segregated dating market.* **References:** * Lin K, Lundquist J. 2013.

    <TEXT>Still more on racism: ### Black men and women appear 'more masculine' than whites; Asian men appear 'less masculine' Lewis (2011) sought to evaluate how race and skin color were perceived in terms of sexual dimorphism. He performed a small study involving 10 female and 8 male Caucasian students in the UK rating their perception of black, white, and mixed race photographs. Male participants viewed only the female faces and female participants viewed only the male faces. He found that participants rated both black men and women as dramatically more "masculine," "strong," and "dominant" than white or mixed faces. While the female participants seemed to find this attractive about the black men, the male participants did not find it attractive in the black women, and rated them lowest in attractiveness. Burke et al. (2013) built on these findings by asking Japanese and Caucasian participants to rate the masculinity and femininity of Caucasian, Asian, and African men and women. African female faces were judged to be significantly less feminine than Caucasian or Asian females faces. Asian men were also rated as significantly lower in masculinity than Caucasian men. **Discussion:** These findings contribute towards a biological explanation for the poor performance of Asian men and black women in online dating, as masculinity for men and femininity for women are known to form a major part of attractiveness for each gender. These findings have been replicated across several cultures and countries, but further study will help to clarify the degree to which this perception is global or likely evolutionary rather than cultural. Related to this, East Asian men have around eight time less facial hair mass than Caucasians, which is also a gerontomorphic feature (Maurer 2016). The most significant genetic variant relating to facial hair is on the EDAR gene (rs365060) is also present in 80% of Caucasians, but only \~3% of Asians ([source](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-science-behind-the-lack-of-facial-hair-for-the-majority-of-Asian-men)). **Quotes:** * *The Asian male faces were rated as significantly lower than the Caucasian males on masculinity (F(1,141) = 7.32, p = .008).* * *The African female faces were rated significantly lower on femininity than the African males were on masculinity (F(1,141) = 67.36, p  lt; .001)* * *Female African faces were judged to be significantly less feminine than the female Caucasian and Asian faces.* * *Lower perceived femininity is known to correlate with lower attractiveness ratings (e.g., Burke and Sulikowski, 2010).* (Burke et al. 2013) * *The results reported above clearly demonstrate that race, or at least the perception of race, affects a variety of perceived characteristics of faces.* * *Black female faces were perceived as more mature, more masculine and stronger than the White faces.* * *A pattern was found for female faces with Whiteness being associated with attractiveness.* (Lewis 2010) **References:** * Burke D, Nolan C, Hayward WG, Russell R, Sulikowski D. 2013. *Is There an Own-Race Preference in Attractiveness?* Evolutionary Psychology. 11(4): 855-872. \[[FullText](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147470491301100410)\] * Lewis MB. 2011. *Who's the fairest of them all?

(2006) analyzed a dataset including the activities of 22,000 users of a major online dating service in Boston and San Diego over a period of three and a half months in 2003. One analysis they performed was to specifically investigate whether those who stated a racial preference behaved any different from those who did not. To maintain a strong sample size, they restricted their analysis to Caucasian members' messaging behaviors. While men who stated they had no racial preference did behave in a less racially biased fashion, women who stated they had no racial preference acted the same as those who said they did not. This data suggests that the only difference between women who state a racial preference and those who do not is either how honest or self aware they are. **References:** * Hitsch GJ, Horta #231;su A, Ariely D. 2006. *What Makes You Click? #8212;Mate Preferences and Matching Outcomes in Online Dating.* University of Chicago  amp; MIT. \[[Abstract](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.895442)\] \[[FullText](http://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/onlinedating.pdf)\] ### Racism in dating is stable or worsening, not improving, over time OkCupid analyzed racial dating data from 2009 and 2014 to evaluate if racism in dating is changing. They found that although people reported they are more open to dating people of other races over that time frame, racially motivated behaviors actually intensified. Thus while it seems apparent people are becoming more interested in portraying themselves as less racially motivated, this is not manifesting in any changes to their actual dating behavior. If anything, their underlying racism has intensified. One must wonder whether it is preferable to suffer racism that is openly acknowledged, or to falsely be told racism doesn't exist but still suffer from it anyway. **Quotes:** * *OkCupid users are certainly no more open-minded than they used to be. If anything, racial bias has intensified a bit.* * *One interesting thing is to compare \[users' racial behaviors\] with what those same users have told us about their racial attitudes.* * *Answers to match questions have been getting significantly less biased over time \[i.e. "Do you strongly prefer to date someone of your own race?" and "Is interracial marriage a bad idea?"\]* * *And yet the underlying behavior has stayed the same.* **References:** * Rudder C. 2014. *Race and Attraction, 2009  #8211; 2014*. OkTrends. \[[FullText](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/raceandattraction20092014.html)\]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think we've accumulated a healthy amount of data on a few of the factors that can contribute to one's involuntary celibacy, including looks, mental health, race, and personality traits, with no mention of personal beliefs being important. Now let me see your proof that involuntary celibates are "reprehensible people who are so abhorrent nobody wants anything to do with them physically"...oh wait, you don't have any? You're telling me that your definition of "involuntary celibate" is not supported by data? You're telling me that reddit's definition of involuntary celibates as horrible people only serves to feed the just world fallacy? Who could have guessed?!?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Self-identified incels would admit that their movement has a problem with radicalism...if they had a movement, that is. If you look into popular incel message boards, you #8217;ll see that they have no real organization, no direction, and no unity apart from being involuntarily celibate (and even then most of them aren #8217;t even really incels, theyre just on the board for the fun of it). They constantly bicker, have little common ideology (if youll call hating women an ideology), and all they do is shitpost and complain about women in their own lingo. When they DO call for violence, its usually in response for a story about bullying or perceived mistreatment that may or may not be fictional. So, ultimately not that different from boards like 4chan. We try to play them as some sort of boogeyman, but at the end of the day theyre just more anonymous internet shitposters.</TEXT>

Not to mention the tens of thousands of extra urns that were churned out by the crematoriums. Not to mention the CCP #8217;s illustrious history of covering up disease outbreaks.

    <TEXT>Except the 4634 that you say are  #8220;plausible figures #8221; based on your estimate are completely fabricated. Regardless of how well it fits into your estimate, the fact that it was faked straight from the previous number annuls its validity. So, no, you shouldn #8217;t even take their number into consideration. Also, anyone from Wuhan can tell you that even your estimates are also way off the mark. Wuhan crematoriums cremated 220 people a day before the outbreak. During the outbreak, they worked nonstop, cremating an average of almost 1000 people a day, and that was just for one month out of the two and a half month outbreak. I can #8217;t really extrapolate further from that, but I can tell you that the number we have right now is already way greater than 11600. And thats only for Wuhan. Furthermore your estimate assumes that the CCP #8217;s draconian counter-pandemic measures were more effective than those of its more developed counterparts. Do you honestly think locking up and abandoning a city of 11 million people to die is an effective counter-pandemic plan?</TEXT>

Nothing shady going on here I'm sure. Furthermore, are you simply going to ignore the abundance of evidence pointing to highly elevated crematorium activity in Wuhan? Here is one such article: https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200608/Cremation-numbers-reveal-possible-suppression-of-true-COVID-19-data-in-China.aspx I find it funny how you think I'm somehow defending the United States by criticizing the CCP. Nowhere did I even make a mention of the US's response, yet here you are, assuming that I'm defending the US and that I'm probably from it. It's almost as if you have some sort of agenda here....

    <TEXT>Here is one such source that you may find "reliable", which includes information on the operations of crematoriums during the pandemic: https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200608/Cremation-numbers-reveal-possible-suppression-of-true-COVID-19-data-in-China.aspx As for measures like their contact tracing app, the video says that 200 million people out of 1.4 billion had used it. Now that might be enough if deployed immediately, but not only does it take time to develop these apps, the coronavirus was able to spread unchecked throughout Wuhan and China for weeks to months. However what I actually intend to criticize here is the CCP's strategy of pandemic containment by completely shutting down Wuhan. Now, while you can say it was effective for protecting the other provinces from infection, you can't say that it was effective at all for protecting the lives of Wuhan citizens. The immediate aftermath of the lockdown was well documented: major supply shortages, extreme hospital overcrowding, near impossibility of testing/treatment, lack of mobility, and lack of basic services: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-residents-coronavirus-lockdown-forced-order-food-apps-delivered-home-2020-3 https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3051654/coronavirus-wuhan-still-struggling-get-medical-supplies-after Many Wuhan citizens were left to fend for themselves for weeks. You can see how that turned out from the sheer number of excess urns produced in Wuhan alone. While some Redditors might be telling a different story, do note that you are already amongst the elite in China if you're able to speak English and have access to the western Internet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're equating companies controlling what we're able to talk about to to not being able to talk anywhere on the internet. That's simply wrong. Sure, there exists millions of obscure forums that are devoted to a wide variety of content, including those found objectionable by other sites or simply illegal. But the vast, vast majority of internet users will never even set foot in these boards, which makes them irrelevant to the mainstream of internet discourse. When companies from Reddit to Disney control what we're allowed to talk about, they DO NOT do so by suppressing any and all discourse across the internet. They do so by promoting content they support and suppressing content they don't like, and what we see on the front page is what they allow to stay up. If we never see it, we won't talk about it, hence what we talk about is what they allow us to see. You won't go out to alternate forums to discuss these topics, because you won't even know they exist. Anyone who has used any sort of social networking knows that much. Your analogy with the fridge is false equivalency because my fridge has no influence whatsoever on internet discourse. You might still say "but muh private corporations". Okay, they can do it. Does that make it right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, reddit has a TOS, no harassment, threats of violence, etc, all that good stuff. They can do that. What is NOT good stuff, though, is the inconsistency with which they interpret and enforce these policies. This inconsistency is the reason why harmless meme subs like waterniggas are banned while powermod criticism is suppressed and r/femaledatingstrategy and r/sino go free without even being quarantined. How is that in any way reasonable? Reddit #8217;s control of the discourse is massively inconsistent with their TOS.</TEXT>

Rittenhouse shooting Rosenbaum after he threw the bag is even more damning than if he had shot him during the act, because he KNEW Rosenbaum's most dangerous weapon was a bag of his personal items. Despite knowing this, and having significant distance on Rosenbaum, he STILL popped him in the head. Can you guess what's that called? It's not self defense and rhymes with burger. Pretty funny how the video published by a propagandist supporting Rittenhouse actually makes him look worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, which part of me using evidence from the video suggested that the videos were fake? Are you even responding to the right comment? And lmao at suggesting Rittenhouse was right to murder Rosenbaum just because he saw him as a threat. Do you even know the definition of self defense? From the Wisconsin state legislature: "A person is privileged to threaten or intentionally use force against another for the purpose of preventing or terminating what the person reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference with his or her person by such other person. The actor may intentionally use only such force or threat thereof as the actor reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate the interference. The actor may not intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself." I know, a plastic bag just screams "imminent death or great bodily harm". And I love how you're equating protestors (all of which are rioters in your eyes no matter how peaceful they are) defying curfew, an act of civil disobedience, to an illegally armed 17 year old child crossing state lines to enact extrajudicial violence for businesses unrelated to him after curfew. At least three laws broken right there, and with deadly consequences, but clearly he is on the same level as protestors breaking curfew. Your trolling is not appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You sound like someone who hasn't watched either video or read any documents and just got all your "facts" from Twitter. The autopsy that had the toxicology report you all love to cherrypick for your overdose memes came to the conclusion that he died from "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression". In the video, Chauvin continued to kneel on his neck for four minutes after he became unresponsive. But go ahead, keep claiming that he died from an overdose and that Chauvin had nothing to do with it. Just because you keep repeating it doesn't make you right. Blake may or may not have had a knife. But anyone who's watched the video can see that he had his back turned to the cops the whole way to the car, and that he didn't stab them even when they grabbed him. So what you're telling me that the reasonable police response to noncompliance from a vulnerable target is seven shots in the back? You need to chill, there aren't enough unlicked boots for the rest of us bro.</TEXT>

I raised the issue of black people being being far more likely to be impoverished and you answered by saying they chose that outcome because they chose to live lives of crime. You directly implied that their poverty is an expected outcome of them committing crimes, forget the fact that being born into appalling conditions is the reason why they're living lives of crime in the first place. You don't get to say shit about holding people accountable for their actions when you don't even want to address the reasons behind their actions.  gt;BLM killed Show me a single instance where that happened....oh wait! YOU CAN'T! Don't even think about pulling the "random non-political rioter is actually a BLM activist" card. It won't work.  gt;Yeahhh, lets take away money from the police, even though they couldn't stop us from burning a city to the ground and murdering other black people, lets defund them so no one is safe You really love raising strawmen don't you? It won't work. Wait, do you even know what "strawman" means? Would explain how you're ignoring everything I'm saying.  gt;I oppose BLM because they're hypocrites, "we stand against systemic racism, which is why we looted, burned to the ground, and killed black store owners in the name of a dead criminal!

Unless, of course, you count black people being more likely to commit crimes just because they're black as a "statistic".  gt;I just don't agree with the movement You realize that the BLM movement is about non-violent protest against police brutality and racially motivated violence?

If you knew what an oxymoron is then why did you use it incorrectly you tool (funny, calling me a tool for calling out your obvious mistake? I guess I'd rather be a tool than be you)? And yes, you are a useful tool: a lulz cow. Are you purposefully being retarded? Or are you pretending that BLM protestors are responsible for killings that they didn't perpetrate? You claimed BLM is killing people and destroying cities. You gave me evidence of apolitical rioters (or are black people BLM activists by default?) killing people and destroying cities while BLM protestors are trying to stop them. You sit there smugly with your false evidence, thinking "haha librul, how are you going to prove that BLM are good guys now" when you literally did just that for me. If you still don't see this then you are truly incapable of introspection. Don't try painting me as the desperate one. How am I desperate?

    <TEXT>Oh, so you were just sarcastic that Black Lives Matter has a "Criminal Division", eh? Not hyperbole or banter? That means, not only do you believe that BLM DOES NOT have a criminal division, you are also expressing skepticism over BLM's alleged propensity for violence, as sarcasm overwhelmingly involves saying the opposite of what's true. Another 160 IQ move against yourself. You now have two choices: admit that you are too intellectually inept to pull off basic sarcasm, or concede that BLM's ties to violence are greatly exaggerated and stop going on about how BLM is murdering people. Your call.  gt;every person I listed that died as a direct result of the BLM protests, which you stated numerous times, that you didn't even read(willful ignorance)...were all BLACK And what are you trying to prove? That BLM doesn't really care about black lives because some rioter was shot halfway across the city from the protests? Or because police accidentally shot a random guy while trying to disperse a protest? Did you know there is difference between correlation and causation? Where's the proof that BLM demonstrators actually killed them? Your attempts to link BLM to these deaths are pathetic, but not unexpected for a rabid cuckservative.  gt;his death was swept under the rug  gt;because BLM ARE against police brutality...when that brutality is coming from a white man and being inflicted on a black man This is what you said: "I'd be surprised if you did know about him tbh, because you never saw his death in the news." How can BLM sweep his death under the rug if they never heard of him? You are genuinely retarded if you fail to spot this contradiction.  gt;I have never met anyone who has made a pedestal that high before The only reason I look like I'm on a pedestal is because you're stuck in a dung hole looking up.

You now have two choices: admit that you are too intellectually inept to pull off basic sarcasm, or concede that BLM's ties to violence are greatly exaggerated and stop going on about how BLM is murdering people. And don't whine that I'm trying to project any authority on you. You brought this upon yourself. If you abdicate your right to choose, then you silently concede to being a half-wit incapable of sarcasm who unsuccessfully tried to argue that Black Lives Matter is killing everyone. The ball is in your court.  gt;BLM only care about Black Lives when that Black Life, is ended by a White Man, notice how some of the perpetrators of those deaths of black people during the protests, were ALSO Black Oh, so NOW you're gonna claim that BLM doesn't care about black on black violence? Well, here's a little fun fact: the whole point of the Black Lives Matter movement is to protest racially motivated violence. Do you know what's not racially motivated violence? Black on black crime. News flash, pal: black people don't kill each other for being black. Now I know you're going to say this: "but black people still account for the majority of black victims! Why don't they protest that??" Second news flash, pal: [they do](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/04/why-dont-black-people-protest-black-on-black-violence/255329/). It's funny in a ironic way how you're calling me a retard for not being able to interpret your inane ramblings that have only now been made understandable. Especially since you used a white man getting shot by police as "evidence" that BLM doesn't care about black on black crime.  gt;I've also stated that I'm apolitical  gt;Are any of these black people a victim of systemic racism? I don't think denying systemic racism is apolitical. I also don't think posting a picture of you wearing a shirt featuring a black guy getting tortured by police is apolitical. Not a single liberal does this, but plenty of right wingers do. Or is it merely a coincidence that you talk and act exactly like a right winger? You calling me ignorant is the most lazy attempt at trolling I've ever seen.  gt;I pulled him out of the woodwork because his death was swept under the rug, because BLM ARE against police brutality...when that brutality is coming from a white man and being inflicted on a black man!...THAT'S! the point I'm making, you unobservant retard!  gt;Did I say that BLM swept his death under the rug?...or did I just say that his death swept under the rug?...you retard Sweatie, if you're going to make a shitty argument at least don't contradict everything that you say...you retard And that's right, you're the one who's butthurt. Otherwise, why would you come scrambling back two weeks later to a dead comments section just to argue that black people aren't oppressed?

If anything, I'd call you a fucking idiot for trying to "prove" BLM doesn't care about black on black crime by bringing up a white guy getting shot by police.  gt;I don't need to denounce being part of something that I'm not a part of "sweetie"...especially when I've stated numerous times that I'm apolitical...you just won't get that through your thick skull will you!...I don't vote you moron!...because I'm apolitical!...duh! "SIEG HEIL!" "Wow, man, you sound like a Nazi" "What? How dare you! I'm apolitical because I'm not part of the Nazi party!!! The holocaust didn't happen!" This is the comparison I would make to mock your claims of being apolitical, but I'm sure the whole thing will fly over your head and make you think I'm calling you a Nazi when I'm clearly not. So allow me to explain. When you call people Nazis, you're not saying they're part of the Nazi party. You're saying they hold ideas that are associated with Nazism. Same for you. When did I say you're were part of some far right party? I only said that your beliefs are far right. Is that too much for you to comprehend? To hold political beliefs without belonging to any party? If you don't have the intellectual capacity to comprehend even this then you are really a joke.  gt;why not scoot back through this conversation and prove me wrong buttercup  gt;I pulled him out of the woodwork because his death was swept under the rug, because BLM ARE against police brutality...when that brutality is coming from a white man and being inflicted on a black man!...THAT'S! the point I'm making, you unobservant retard!  gt;I never said that BLM swept his death under the rug -You when confronted with evidence that you said BLM swept his death under the rug. Shameless. But lets just say that you really *didn't* say BLM swept his death under the rug. Now what? Then his death was swept under the rug by people other than BLM. How's that supposed to prove BLM is bad? It has absolutely no relevance to the topic at hand. Lmao you absolute fucking retard, even if you were right you'd still prove nothing #129313;. But yeah, you're the one who should apologize for wasting my time having to explain all this basic elementary shit.  gt;telling someone who finished school over a decade ago, to stay there So you're saying that you're 16 years old? Would explain a lot of things. Go back to school. It's obvious that your one year of kindergarten hasn't prepared you for the internet. And it's actually hilarious that you're talking about safe spaces. Especially when we're discussing this in a right wing safe space right now. And don't even try denying this place is a right wing safe space. Otherwise, why would people (including me) in this very thread be downvoted en masse by the hivemind for simply providing a voice of reason? Now THIS is an actual example of the "pot calling the kettle black". Thanks for giving me the opportunity to show that, unlike you, I am actually capable of using second grade level idioms. Holy shit do your "insults" keep backfiring on you #129313; #129313; #129313;.  gt;nobody else's personal opinions can affect that minuscule closed mind of yours... This is coming from someone whose claims were repeatedly debunked and still refuses to concede. Priceless. Arguing with internet strangers is obviously not your forte. But keep going, because providing internet strangers with lots of lulz IS your forte.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;yet another unfounded accusation of being far-right  gt;black people aren't discriminated against and aren't poor  gt;BLM is a terrible violent movement that just kills people and burns down cities  gt;the media doesn't care about white men  gt;unfounded It's merely a coincidence that your views align exactly with those of the American far right! And no. Just because you're ignorant of the views of the American far right doesn't make your views any less far right. If I say "Heil Hitler", does claiming that I'm apolitical mean that I'm not a Nazi? Hell fucking no. So shut the fuck up saying that your views aren't far right just because you're not part of a party.  gt;it's "nursery" over here petal... Who the fuck cares what it is over there? Does it contribute to your argument? Remember that Reddit is an American site, so your little interjection is completely fucking irrelevant. But do you know what is relevant? You saying things like "petal", or "fruitcake". Do you know what "petal" and "fruitcake" mean over here in the States, especially when used by an actual soyboy? They mean "I'm a fucking faggot". The more you know #128522;.  gt;considering Hitler was a Christian that used the Catholic Church as a crutch to gain political power That's hilarious. How is this in any way relevant to what we're discussing? You're completely unhinged.  gt;how you associate a non-interest in politics with a socialist political party is absolutely astounding I predicted that you'd interpret my comparison as calling you a Nazi. I didn't think that even with my disclaimer you'd still do that. Your dismal intellect is hilariously predictable. Unless, of course, you're trying to ignore my point on purpose, which is that you don't have to be politically active to hold political beliefs.  gt;it is possible to express racist views in a sarcastic manner and not be a racist petal How does this refute the fact that you're able to "hold political beliefs without belonging to any party"? Another "gotcha" moment that any rational person can see totally falls flat. You're actually a joke. But you say your views aren't far right, or what you specified, racist, because you're being sarcastic? Then explain to me, how is you denying systemic racism and black poverty "sarcastic"? How is trying to paint BLM as an evil movement "sarcastic"? How is wearing a shirt celebrating a black guy getting tortured by police "sarcastic"? I await your response with bated breath.  gt;the amount of times I covered this Notice how you never refuted these quotes from yourself: "after all your claims about the BLM movement being against police brutality...because Duncan Lemp was White, his life doesn't matter!" "I pulled him out of the woodwork because his death was swept under the rug, because BLM ARE against police brutality...when that brutality is coming from a white man and being inflicted on a black man!...THAT'S! the point I'm making, you unobservant retard!" You can't simply choose to ignore evidence just because it doesn't suit your narrative, sweatie.  gt;your own brands and labels of other people...you are an idiotic disgusting human being Ironic. Especially since the only reason I (correctly) labelled you as racist and far right is because you labelled BLM as looters, arsonists, murderers, and slandered them with "Black Lives Matter Criminal Division". Don't believe it? Look at your own comment history...you are an idiotic, disgusting "human being".  gt;I thought you were against Police Brutality no matter who it's against And I never claimed otherwise. But lets examine this little tidbit should we?  gt;after all your claims about the BLM movement being against police brutality...because Duncan Lemp was White, his life doesn't matter! This is you using Duncan Lemp's death to "prove" that white lives don't matter to Black Lives Matter. How in the everliving fuck is BLM not caring about his death supposed to prove that I don't care about police brutality on whites? At this point calling you a moron is a compliment to you.  gt;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, you actually believe that you're a voice of reason?...fucking LOL Notice how you didn't deny this place is a right wing circlejerk. But let me get this straight, claiming that celebrating a black guy getting tortured is racist, saying that systemic racism exists, or saying BLM isn't a murderous movement is "unreasonable" to you #129313; #129313;??? In which reasonable world does this not make you far right #129313; #127758; #129313; #127758; #129313;??? And yet you'll still claim "muh apoliticism", "I'm not raycis". We all know you're just making excuses.  gt;I on the other hand of provided several links You realize that not a single one of the links you've spammed actually supports your argument, right? Keep reading to see why.  gt;debunked with what?...show me ANY evidence you've provided?...not a single link! Uuhhhh....what the hell is this?  gt;Now I know you're going to say this: "but black people still account for the majority of black victims! Why don't they protest that??" Second news flash, pal: [they do](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/04/why-dont-black-people-protest-black-on-black-violence/255329/) But why the hell do I need to provide evidence when your argument is literally this:  gt;I oppose BLM because they're hypocrites, "we stand against systemic racism, which is why we looted, burned to the ground, and killed black store owners in the name of a dead criminal! And you fail to provide a single piece of evidence linking the Black Lives Matter movement to looting, arson, or murder? "But-but-but I showed you so many deaths that occurred during the demonstrations, surely this means that BLM killed them!!!!" Lmao shut the fuck up. I'll use evidence to contest your claims when you are able to establish *a single* causative relation between BLM and the killings. Remember, I'm not the one actively arguing that BLM is the good guys. YOU'RE the one actively arguing that BLM is the bad guys, and therefore it's on *YOU* to provide a logically valid and sound argument for me to refute. Get it now? This is the big boy internet. You can't get away with "because I think it's true" or "I'll be right if I just ignore him". You're not thinking about it logically. You need to think about it logically.  gt;YOU are the true face of BLM...YOU'RE the racist, not me! It's always cute when actual racists try to accuse other people of being racist. Soo, I'm the racist one for pointing out BLM isn't the boogeyman you made them out to be, but you're not racist for denying systemic racism, calling BLM a bunch of racist murderers, or unapologetically wearing a shirt celebrating a black guy getting tortured by police? I've seen five year olds make better "no u" turnarounds.  gt;I provide you with "lulz" do I?...awwww, well ain't that cute...I just wanna pinch your rosy fucking cheeks I don't think you even know what lulz means. Because if you did, you'd realize that the only cheeks getting pinched here is your scrawny soyboy ass. You like that? I know you want it. Me: "So you're saying that you're 16 years old? Would explain a lot of things. Go back to school. It's obvious that your one year of kindergarten hasn't prepared you for the internet."  gt;If I left school over a decade ago, how in the FUCK would that make me 16 years old Holy fuck, I can't #129315; #129315; #129315; #129315; #129315;!!! I even went out of my way to say that the only grade you finished is kindergarten, just in case you didn't get it, but YOU STILL MISSED IT!!!!! LMAOOOOOOOO ARE YOU SPECIAL ED OR HIGH OR SOMETHING???? Because clearly your mind isn't working right. I mean, I literally told you the joke and YOU STILL DIDN'T GET IT #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313; #129313;!!!! You are, hands down, THE MOST idiotic "person" I've had the fortune to cyberbully on the internet. It's now that I realize the futility of trying to convince you of anything. I mean, if I can't even get you to understand a very low level, obvious joke, how can I possibly get you to understand the higher level concepts of debate theory? At this rate I'll have to put you through grades 1 to 12 just to get you onto even footing with me. Not gonna. I simply do not have the time to endlessly go in circles with a petulant manchild. I'm putting you in time-out: you're blocked.</TEXT>
