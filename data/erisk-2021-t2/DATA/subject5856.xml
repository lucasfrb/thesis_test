The conflicting ways in which officials and aides are responding after two staff members were diagnosed with coronavirus this week  #8212; Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller and a military valet to the president  #8212; continued to raise questions about how the White House is responding to the challenge of maintaining a #160;[safe work environment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-white-house-events-coronavirus-testing/2020/05/01/21a9b5bc-8bbe-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_6 amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_6) #160;for Trump, Pence and their staff. The White House press office declined to comment on Saturday whether other employees have been told to self-quarantine beyond those Miller and the military aide.  #8220;The president #8217;s physician and White House operations continue to work closely to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the president, first family and the entire White House complex safe and healthy at all times, #8221; White House spokesman Judd Deere said.  #8220;In addition to social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, hand sanitizer, and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces, every staff member in proximity to the president and vice president is being tested daily for covid-19 as well as any guests. #8221; But the nervousness and concern among White House staffers became more palpable on Saturday, according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the tensions. Now that Redfield and Hahn are both staying away, some officials said they don #8217;t know if they should keep going to work at the White House. Staffers who had potentially been in contact with Miller were still getting calls on Saturday from officials trying to gauge their exposure to the virus, according to one person who received a call. All White House staffers received a memo from the White House management office on Friday, which encouraged employees to  #8220;practice maximum telework #8221; and to  #8220;work remotely if at all possible. #8221; The White House will receive  #8220;heightened levels of daily cleaning, #8221; according to the memo. It also tells employees they must quarantine for 14 days if they leave the Washington region and must report all their travel. The memo did not suggest that employees wear masks, as the CDC has suggested for all Americans in public spaces. Masks generally protect other people from the person wearing the face covering, rather than preventing the individual from contracting the virus.  #8220;We are exercising daily caution by testing EOP staff who have high proximity to the president and Vice President for covid-19, #8221; the memo says.  #8220;For any presumptive positive covid-19 results, the White House medical Unit conducts immediate contact tracing and notifies any affected individuals. #8221; On Thursday, aides began to close the door to the outer Oval Office, and Secret Service and White House officials began to limit who was in the Oval Office, even as Trump continued not to wear a mask and evoked no concern. Elsewhere in the administration, senior officials were taking varied levels of precaution in response to the positive cases at the White House. The FDA said late Friday that Hahn began to self-quarantine for two weeks after being exposed to an individual who tested positive. A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter, said the individual in question was Miller, who was present at task force meetings attended by Hahn and other health officials. Redfield  #8220;will be teleworking for the next two weeks, #8221; according to an CDC spokesman, who said Redfield  #8220;has been determined to have had a low-risk exposure #8221; on Wednesday to  #8220;a person at the White House who has covid-19. #8221; The spokesman, Benjamin Hayes, did not identify the infected person. Hayes said Redfield was last tested on April 27 and had a negative result.  #8220;He is feeling fine and has no symptoms, #8221; Hayes said, who added that, if Redfield needs to go to the White House during his teleworking time, he would have his temperature taken, be screened for symptoms and keep at a distance from others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has been tested  #8220;multiple times, #8221; most recently on Friday, according to a department spokeswoman. He has tested negative each time and is following the advice of his physicians at the White House Medical Unit, the spokeswoman said. Asked about a potential quarantine, the spokeswoman said Azar, a member of the task force, is continuing to consult with his doctors about whether that could be necessary. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health #8217;s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and another task force member,  #8220;has tested negative for Covid-19 as recently as yesterday, #8221; an institute spokeswoman said Saturday.  #8220;He will continue to be tested regularly and is actively monitoring his temperature and other health indicators. #8221; The spokeswoman said Fauci, a leading infectious disease expert and one of the administration #8217;s most recognizable figures in the pandemic response,  #8220;is considered to be at relatively low risk based on the degree of his exposure. Nevertheless he is taking appropriate precautions to mitigate risk to any of his personal contacts while still allowing him to carry out his responsibilities in this public health crisis. #8221; Brett Giroir, the HHS assistant secretary for health who is in charge of coronavirus testing, has not been at the White House since Tuesday, participating in meetings since then remotely, according to a spokeswoman. He had been tested previously for the virus and was negative, the spokeswoman said. It remains unclear whether some White House officials and other members of the coronavirus task force have been in closer proximity to the infected aides than others and therefore would be at greater risk of contracting the virus. But concerns were evident at the White House, where there is worry that if Miller and the unidentified personal valet to Trump are infected, then multiple officials may potentially be at risk. After news of Miller #8217;s diagnosis, aides were going through seating charts, looking at her schedule to discern where she had been and then trying to question anyone who may have been close to her in a room. Emails were sent about possible exposure, and staffers were called.  #8220;Any place she spent extensive time was immediately sanitized, #8221; one official said. Miller was regularly in the Oval Office and around Trump while the daily coronavirus task force news briefings were ongoing, but has not been since the briefings ended a couple of weeks ago. She was in the task force meeting in the Situation Room on Thursday, and she sat in the back row facing Pence on the far right side, closer to the door, according to a person familiar with the situation. Miller, who had told other colleagues that she did not have symptoms, attended a senior staff meeting on the coronavirus at 8 a.m. on Friday and was near other aides, rattling some of her White House colleagues. Neither Trump nor Pence were in the meeting. A number of aides from Pence #8217;s office were sent home on Friday after the contact tracing was complete. Miller is married to top White House aide Stephen Miller, who is expected to quarantine at home for the time being. Friday was  #8220;totally nuts, #8221; a senior administration official said. A White House official said all visitors and employees now will be questioned by doctors about a list of symptoms before they enter the complex. The East Wing staff is wearing masks. Agents on the president #8217;s detail  #8212; who work in three rotating shifts  #8212; typically huddle in a small  #8220;down room #8221; a floor below the Oval Office when Trump is there. Those agents have been wearing face masks for several days, according to one administration official, due to concerns they cannot appropriately distance in this confined space. But other Secret Service agents are not wearing masks on campus, according to two senior administration officials who interact with Trump. The concerns are spreading to the Trump campaign, where a senior official said there was no plan to hold a large-scale campaign event with the president until at least August.  #8220;It #8217;s just not practical right now, #8221; the official said,  #8220;to even try. #8221; *Laurie McGinley and Carol Leonnig contributed to this report.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By #160;[ALEX WIGGLESWORTH](https://www.latimes.com/people/alex-wigglesworth) STAFF WRITER #160;MAY 9, 202010:37 AM The city of Pasadena is warning against Mother #8217;s Day gatherings after its public health department recently traced a cluster of at least five coronavirus cases to a birthday party. The party was held after the #160;[city issued stay-at-home orders](https://www.cityofpasadena.net/city-manager/news-releases/city-of-pasadena-issues-safer-at-home-order-for-control-of-covid-19/) #160;March 19 and was attended by a large number of extended family members and friends who did not wear face coverings or stay six feet apart, the city said in a news release.  #8220;One person showed up to the party exhibiting symptoms and joking she may have the virus, #8221; Lisa Derderian, spokeswoman for the city of Pasadena, said in an email.  #8220;The aftermath affected several others who became seriously ill because of one person #8217;s negligent and selfish behavior. #8221; Through contact tracing, a Pasadena Public Health Department disease investigation team discovered more than five laboratory-confirmed #160;[coronavirus cases](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/#nt=00000171-32cf-df28-a17d-76effe2a0002-liK0promoLarge-7030col2-main) #160;among attendees of the party  #8220;and many more ill individuals, #8221; the city said. The team identified the woman as the index case, or the first patient in the outbreak identified with the infection, officials said.  #8220;This is an example of how good contact tracing can identify disease clusters and tell us more about the spread of disease in our community, #8221; Dr. Matthew Feaster, an epidemiologist with the Public Health Department, said in a statement. City officials reminded residents that, even as some recreation areas are reopening and #160;[some businesses are resuming curbside pickup](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-08/these-are-the-california-businesses-that-can-reopen-and-these-are-the-rules) #160;services, it #8217;s still recommended that those who are 65 and older or have underlying health conditions stay home.  #8220;Pasadena residents who stay home keep themselves and their loved ones protected from COVID-19, #8221; said Dr. Ying-Ying Goh, director and health officer of the Pasadena Public Health Department, in a statement. She said that gatherings of people who don #8217;t live in the same household remain prohibited. That includes Mother #8217;s Day parties.  #8220;The virus remains highly contagious, #8221; Goh said.  #8220;[Social distancing, frequent hand washing, and wearing face coverings](https://www.latimes.com/topic/health) #160;remain our best defenses against the further spread of COVID-19 in our community. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"The only way to make sense of Bolton #8217;s behavior is to recognize that he actually did intend and expect to testify. He #160;*wanted* #160;to testify, but wanted to appear to be #160;*forced* #160;to do it. Perhaps he thought that, as a reluctant witness, he #8217;d be less open to being caricatured as a disgruntled, discharged adviser, and his credibility would have been enhanced. So he #160;[insisted on a court order](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bolton-willing-to-defy-white-house-and-testify-if-court-clears-the-way-according-to-people-familiar-with-his-views/2019/11/07/dd72d73c-00aa-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_19) to appear before the House. But Bolton made one fateful misjudgment. He overestimated the character, honor and patriotism of Senate Republicans. It would have taken just four, joining with Democrats, for the Senate to have issued a subpoena. But #160;[only two](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-trial-live-updates/2020/01/31/9a853bbe-4415-11ea-b5fc-eefa848cde99_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21) #160;voted to hear Bolton testify. A Yale-educated lawyer, Bolton perhaps calculated that Senate Republicans would live up to their oaths of office, and to the separate impeachment-trial oath they took to do 'impartial justice.' He assumed they would uphold the Constitution. Sadly, he was wrong. For that miscalculation, both he and the nation  #8212; but especially the nation  #8212; have paid a great price."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>fine. let's just criticize specifically what he said. "animals literally taking over cities,"- I was being very kind- he's straight up dehumanizing, which is an old tried and true racist trope; which he then qualified by "burning down churches"- no churches have been "burned down" during the protests. he was presumably referring to St. John's Episcopal Church in DC, where there was a small fire set in the basement, which was quickly put out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Houston's leading source of intensive care unit (ICU) data had seemingly removed all previously published reports from its website on Sunday morning, as Texas health officials continue to report a statewide spike in hospitalizations related to the novel coronavirus. The Texas Medical Center (TMC), a cluster of hospitals and health care research institutions located in central Houston, previously released ongoing reports detailing ICU admission numbers throughout the pandemic. Its reports included information about patients admitted to Houston-area ICUs with novel virus infections as well as patients admitted for other illnesses. The data was collected from at least seven hospitals affiliated with the TMC's medical network. The TMC also published data that showed ongoing changes to Houston's overall ICU capacity, which #160;[reached 100 percent](https://www.khou.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/houston-hospitals-ceo-provide-update-on-bed-capacity-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/285-a5178aa2-a710-49db-a107-1fd36cdf4cf3) #160;late last week. On Wednesday, when #160;[3 percent](https://www.newsweek.com/houston-icus-90-percent-capacity-texas-coronavirus-cases-break-records-1513077) #160;of the city's ICU beds remained available, the TMC's most recent report noted that nearly 900 additional beds could be added to local hospital units under the medical center's "sustainable surge" and "unsustainable surge plans." The former plan would allow for an indefinite increase of 373 ICU beds across medical facilities, while the latter would temporarily introduce 504 beds for emergency purposes. *Newsweek* #160;reached out to the TMC for comments regarding the apparent removal of its ICU charts, but did not receive a reply in time for publication. Alongside several other U.S. states, Texas has seen a substantial rise in new cases and hospitalizations related to the respiratory syndrome since the beginning of June, about one month after statewide businesses began to reopen in-person services. More than #160;[57,000 new virus cases](https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83) #160;were diagnosed in Texas since June 13, bringing the state's total to at least 143,371 positive tests on Saturday afternoon. Texas hospitalizations reached a new peak Saturday, #160;[with 5,523 virus patients](https://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-hospitalizations-peak-california-texas-cases-soar-1513898) #160;admitted to medical facilities across the state. The latest figure surpassed record-high hospitalization numbers reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) throughout the second half of the month. More than half of Texas patients currently hospitalized with symptoms of the novel virus were admitted during the last two weeks. According to the Texas DSHS, slightly more than 1,300 ICU beds were unoccupied throughout the state as of Saturday, as were close to 13,000 general-use hospital beds. In response to the recent influx of cases and hospitalizations, Texas Governor Greg Abbott #160;[paused statewide reopening](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-stops-reopening-coronavirus-cases-spike-state-1513448) #160;procedures on Thursday and re-implemented certain restrictions formerly applied to bars and restaurants. He also ordered hospitals in Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis counties #8212;which have reported the highest concentrations of virus cases compared to other areas of the state #8212;to #160;[suspend elective surgeries](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-issues-executive-expanding-hospital-capacity-order-suspends-elective-surgeries-in-four-texas-counties) #160;as means to "ensure hospital bed availability" for novel coronavirus patients. Houston is located in Harris County.</TEXT>

The venue capacity for the indoor event was close to 3,000 attendees, organizers say. Throughout the service, the members of the choir sang at full volume, behind an orchestra. Between songs, the choir members put their masks back on when they sat down, according to pool reports from the event. The members of the choir had space between them, but it was not clear if it was the recommended six feet. Face masks at the event were "strongly encouraged," with signs posted around the venue signaling the suggestion. According to pool reports from the event, at least half of the crowd was wearing a face covering, an act which experts say can reduce the transmission of Covid-19 by as much as 50%."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"United States intelligence officers and Special Operations forces in Afghanistan alerted their superiors as early as January to a suspected Russian plot to pay bounties to the Taliban to kill American troops in Afghanistan, according to officials briefed on the matter. The crucial information that led the spies and commandos to focus on the bounties included the recovery of a large amount of American cash from a raid on a Taliban outpost that prompted suspicions. Interrogations of captured militants and criminals played a central role in making the intelligence community confident in its assessment that the Russians had offered and paid bounties in 2019, another official has said. Armed with this information, military and intelligence officials have been reviewing American and other coalition combat casualties since early last year to determine whether any were victims of the plot. Four Americans were killed in combat in early 2020, but the Taliban have not attacked American positions since a February [agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-deal.html) to end the long-running war in Afghanistan." jfc. no way Trump could not have been briefed. and nothing, not a peep from him about this. yet pushing to get Russia reinstated into G7.

    <TEXT>~~correlation: COVID pneumonia  amp; lung cavitation.~~ I can't access the full original report, but they could not find another clear explanation for pulmonary cavitation (such as secondary infection, autoimmune disorder, pulmonary embolism on the side dominantly affected with cavitation). there were some other nonspecific laboratory abnormalities. in the discussion they cite previous reports of typical pulmonary imaging features in COVID- cavitation was notably absent. in essence, it's an observation of a single patient with a very unusual outcome- cavitation- in the setting of COVID pneumonia. and the news article states "it is unclear what caused the case". however, a cursory reading of the news article (or just glancing at the article title) might lead one to a conclusion that COVID *causes* lung cavitation. and in fact, the title of the original report is "lung cavitation due to COVID pneumonia"- one can easily read that as COVID pneumonia directly results in lung cavitation, ~~i.e. causation~~. we are still fairly early in our experience and understanding of COVID-19, but without additional case reports or case series, it is a stretch *at this time* to read this report and take this ~~correlation (COVID pneumonia  amp; lung cavitation)~~ to imply COVID pneumonia may cause lung cavitation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/).  #9658; Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump [real estate to launder money](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.  #9658; In 1984, David Bogatin  #8212; a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss  #8212; met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))  #9658; Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former "fixer" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.  #9658; Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.  #9658; In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.  #9658; Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.  #9658; From Craig Unger's AMA: "Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence."  #9658; So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate).  #9658; According to a Bloomberg investigation (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  #8220;a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states. #8221;  #9658; In 2013, Federal agents busted an  #8220;ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring #8221; run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a  #8220;sophisticated money-laundering scheme #8221; connected to Semion Mogilevich.  #9658; The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.  #9658; Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.  #9658; A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.  #9658; At the Cityscape USA #8217;s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying "...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets."  #9658; Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because  #8220;We don #8217;t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia. #8221;  #9658; Russian oligarchs [co-signed](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lawrence-odonnell-source-says-russian-oligarchs-co-signed-trumps-deutsche-bank-loans) Trump's Deutsche Bank loans</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Trump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:**  #9658; At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country #8217;s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists #8217; goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.  #9658; Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. "I don't care, I believe Putin"  #9658; Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.  #9658; Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.  #9658; He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events.  #9658; Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies.  #9658; Demanded Russia get invited back into G7  #9658; Pushed the CIA to [give American intelligence to the Kremlin](https://www.justsecurity.org/71279/trump-pushed-cia-to-give-intelligence-to-kremlin-while-taking-no-action-against-russia-arming-taliban/)  #9658; Withdrew from the Open Skies treaty  #9658; Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead American soldiers, and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this writing.  #9658; Announced troop withdrawal from Germany (America's missile defense from Russia and forward operating base against Russian aggression)  #9658; And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the people with crude homemade shivs complete power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>dear Mr. Klain, first thank you so much for being a much needed voice of reason during these difficult times. your service is greatly appreciated. if Biden/Harris win in November (please please please), is there anything that can be done between that time and when they actually get into office to begin to address all the failures of the current administration regarding our pandemic response? although we are so behind the 8 ball, I feel like every minute is precious in terms of preventing more suffering and death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"The World Health Organization warned Tuesday that the [coronavirus](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) pandemic is now being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who don #8217;t know they are infected. Most of the young people either never developed symptoms or had mild symptoms, Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO #8217;s regional director for the Western Pacific, said during a press briefing. 'This increases the risk of spillovers to the most vulnerable: the elderly, the sick, people in long-term care, people who live in densely-populated urban areas and under-served rural areas.'" no sh!t. yet Trump, his new lackey Atlas shrugged, and the rest of his administration continue to insist that we must send our kids back to school.

    <TEXT>Los Angeles has cut utility services on a Hollywood Hills home that held multiple parties in reckless defiance of the city #8217;s coronavirus restrictions, Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday.  #8220;Despite several warnings, this house has turned into a nightclub in the hills, hosting large gatherings in flagrant violation of our public health orders, #8221; Garcetti said in a statement. The Los Angeles Police Department visited the Hollywood Hills property rented by TikTok stars Bryce Hall, Noah Beck and Blake Gray during festivities on Aug. 8 and Aug. 14, according to the mayor #8217;s office. A warning was issued at the first party, and a notice cautioning that the mayor might review the matter was posted in response to the second gathering, according to Garcetti #8217;s office. The 49-year-old mayor decided to drop the hammer.  #8220;If we wish to reopen more businesses, return our kids to school, or get back to our normal lives, we must continue to wear masks, wash our hands frequently, and as we #8217;re emphasizing today, avoid gathering with others, #8221; Garcetti said in the statement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mr Cruz had retweeted a post from the conservative news outlet, [The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/comedian-trevor-noah-offended-by-gender-reveal-parties-child-hasnt-picked-gender-yet?%3Futm_source=twitter amp;utm_medium=social amp;utm_campaign=dwtwitter), which was reporting on a segment from Noah #8217;s show where he was discussing how one of California #8217;s wildfires had supposedly been sparked during a gender reveal party. Noah argued that gender reveal parties are  #8220;starting to feel very outdated".  #8220;Like, given everything we #8217;re learning about gender, gender reveal parties should only happen when the child is old enough to know their actual gender, #8221; Noah said on his show In response to The Daily Wire #8217;s post highlighting the segment, Mr Cruz wrote:  #8220;A fair point. Many liberal males never grow balls. #8221; The senator #8217;s comments were peculiar given that he has been a vociferous supporter of President Donald Trump who has insulted both Mr Cruz #8217;s wife and father on separate occasions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is the Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett's SCOTUS nomination. the White House / GOP callously ignored RBG's dying wishes. before she was even buried, they begin the process of ramming her nomination through and staged this op with little regard for social distancing/masking, a reckless gathering which is now what many consider the superspreader event that is engulfing the WH / GOP. poetic justice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>major difference is the WH is a big work place known to be limited for space especially in the West Wing. and reports already state that he walked back in without a mask with staff milling around. WH staff are already in freak out mode, and understandably so. if anyone believes he's gonna just hole up in the presidential bedroom and follow quarantine, I've got some waterfront property in Arizona to sell you. he cares about no one but himself, and he's going to put people at risk. he should've stayed in a more controlled environment at Walter Reed until he was clearly on the mend instead of forcing his way back.

    <TEXT>the reason to test someone with COVID for antibodies is to see if they #8217;ve developed an immune response after contracting the virus, which takes a couple of weeks. although they tested him before he got the antibody cocktail (which was negative), it doesn't make sense to test someone again a few days #160;*after* he received a huge dose of the same type of antibodies that you are testing for- it will show up as a positive. in either case presence of antibodies does not prove the effectiveness of a treatment- the effectiveness will be determined by how he responds clinically (recovers, or gets worse). at this point the test result adds no useful information and is essentially a waste, and can only muddy the waters.</TEXT>

But the trip was called off on Thursday afternoon while the vice president was in Arizona campaigning.

    <TEXT>yes, this fact gets absorbed in the whole "Biden's not all there" bullshit being pushed by the right, which is just massive projection. but it gives insight into his character- at a young age he overcame it through sheer determination and perseverance, as shown in a recent Frontline [episode](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/the-choice-2020-trump-vs-biden/) (starting around 9:20). and it's one of the many challenges he's faced throughout his life that fuels his compassion. as you pointed out, Biden is very with it, and continues to demonstrate his ability to discuss complex issues in depth. in contrast, Trump can't articulate shit when pressed on actual matters of policy, let alone avoid slurring words and other gaffes that really do raise serious questions about his mental fitness. today was just the latest hilarious/sad example.</TEXT>
