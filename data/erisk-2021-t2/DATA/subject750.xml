    <TEXT>In a Ted Talk Esther Perel (she is an awesome sexologist) once said that - if I remember correctly - most of the time the things that arouse us are the things that we do not love during the day, like having someone dominating you. Maybe this is why it feels morally wrong sometimes... During the day, you would not do or engage in the things that turn you on the most. And maybe this is even what makes them so exciting!! If you're interested, this is the Ted Talk - it is mostly about if you can desire something you already have, like a long term partner. Very interesting ! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sa0RUmGTCYY amp;t=519s</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dead Bedroom from a LL perspective</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 09:18:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I have been reading this subreddit for a while now, because I (F23) feel like I am in a Dead Bedroom too. But, I am not the HL spouse, that's actually my partner (32M). I am the one that rejects her partner a lot because she does not feel like having sex. That does not mean that I do not want to have sex, though. I'm just afraid, worrying that I will not be wet enough or that after I agreed on having sex, I suddenly do not have the desire anymore and I have to disappoint my partner. So, I reject him. I know that this disappoints him too! It's just that I'm afraid I will disappoint him even more when I for some reason do not want to have sex anymore after initiating or consenting it. Also, the pressure that my partner puts on me by elaborating how important sex is to our relationship, makes me feel suffocated and only makes it worse. Now, the reason I am writing this post right now is that the way that some people talk about their LL SO made me feel like absolute shit. Like I am all that is wrong with this world and like I am deliberately trying to manipulate my partner and ruin my relationship. Made me really insecure. And of course I get it! There is a looooot of frustration going on behind the posts. But making an LL SO feel like shit will NOT make them want to have sex with you. Now I don't know everyone's story. A lot of you probably already did what I'm going to suggest, but for the one's who did not: try to talk to your LL SO about what the reasons are for them. Be kind to them. Work TOGETHER, not LL vs. HL. I have been crying for weeks. I hate that my desire is gone. Hate hate hate it! I want it back soooo badly. Last week I found something interesting on Reddit, that I wanted to try with my partner (CNC). BUT, I was so afraid that my partner would think that I had no right to want to try something because I am the LL SO and first I would have to give into his needs before I would have the right to try mine that I did not speak to him for 3 days. This worried me. Then, finally when I could not stop crying I told him. We had an awesome convo. About what he wants, what I want, and how we could discover TOGETHER what would help our sexlife. TLDR: I told this story partly to just get it off my chest, but also to ask everyone to please, please pleeaaaaseeee treat your loved one with kindness!! No matter if he or she is LL or HL, try to find it in your (maybe frustrated) heart to try to place yourself in their position and try to find a solution TOGETHER instead of LL vs. HL.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me see if I understand you: you think I am selfish for "denying his needs"? If that is the case, I absolutely do not agree with you. I don't think the reason why I should have sex with my SO should be because I want to meet his needs. The only reason for me to have sex with my SO, should be because I want to. And I don't think not wanting to have sex is selfish. I think the solution would be; to find something that makes me want to have sex again. The solution is not for me to just do something I do not want so I can meet his needs. I do agree with you that communicating about what the relationship needs is reeaallly important!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that too, I really want us to tackle this together. I am attracted to my partner. Love him so much and I could cuddle and kiss him all day :D But, this is something that happened to me in every relationship. After a couple of months, my desire to have sex just disappears. Normally this wasn't a problem because I used to broke up with those partners when that happened. But this is the first really long term relationship I have ever had (2.5years) and now I have to fix something in myself that I do not understand, that really frustrates me and frankly, something that I never had to fix but could just ignore by breaking up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your awesome reply. I can not do anything but agree 100% with your words. The last paragraph really got to me. Maybe the fact that I am trying to find a way for me to want more sex just so he would be happier with our sexlife is a big contributer to the problem of me not wanting sex. I think maybe I should ask myself the question 'Why would I want to have sex?" And try to find answers that are purely focussed on me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What gets me in the mood sometimes is to sit by myself (so without my SO in sight, haha) and take the time to imagine all the things me and my partner (could) do together when having sex. 9/10 times that works. Also, my boyfriend and I have a groupchat with just us in it. It it solely meant for sexting. This reassures that a) the sexting won't be ruined by someone texting something about groceries for example and b) you can archive the groupchat so no one will be able to see it. I enjoy talking about what we would do to eachother. Also works when initially I am not in the mood, I just text him what he would want to do to me and that works. Don't get me wrong my sexlife is not perfect, I also struggle with getting in the mood. These are just two things that I found out really helped me! Remember that sexual desire never suddenly appears. Sometimes it may feel like it does, but there is always something triggering it. Always. So sometimes you just have to actively look for those things! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, stop comparing your relationship and sex life to those of others - especially because you have no knowledge of those sexlifes and are therefore comparing yours to one that is imaginary. Second, if you do not know why things aren't going the way you want them to, then that is where you have to start. Talk and communicate !! So important. And keep doing that until you reach a breakthrough because it can take a while before that happens. In those talks try to be honest and non-judgemental to each other. Also, try to go on a journey together to discover what it is that you guys find exciting and arousing! Doing that together will be fun and might bring you closer together and you might find some things that you'd want to try! And I think the most important thing is: sex should be fun. It should be enjoyable to the both of you! Find a way to make it fun for the both of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find the food analogy very relatable, speaking as a LLF. Also, that you do not understand the LL of your GF does not mean that it is not true for her. You don't have to fully understand it to work with it. Keep in mind that you're probably both suffering in this situation and try to fight the situation as a "we" instead of as a "you vs. me", which is something I see a lot around here. Of course if the partner does not want that, I get it. But I found that once my bf and I started to address this issue as a "we", it gave me room to breathe and while our sexlife is not where I want it to be yet, it's getting there step by step!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:34:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I (24F) need your advice on how to deal with this situation without being a huge ahole. I have a friend who is... A lot. She texts me all day every day with everything that goes on in her life, asks me an insane amount of questions through text the whole day. I am not a very texty person at all, I do not like to be on my phone all day, so I do not answer fast. And when I open my phone after an hour of not using it and I see 20 messages from her, it annoys me. I already told her this and she said she is fine with me not replying as long as she can send what she wants to tell, but she keeps asking me for replies and texts me question marks all the time. The thing I find most annoying though is that she thinks for me and does things for me (like figuring out whole dietary plans for me) without me asking or without me even wanting her to do those things. It feels sometimes as if she builds her life around me and clings to me, and sometimes she does things (like playing a certain videogame) not because she likes to do it, but because I do it and then she can do it with me. This feels a bit mean because I know that she does nothing to be mean or anything, but it annoys the shit out of me up until the point that I can feel irritable the whole day because of her texts. I have already discussed these things with her 3 times, but it seems as if she does not do anything with our conversations about the topic. At this point this friendship brings me more annoyance than joy, while this used to be a very very amazing friendship. I must add that these problems were always there, they just increased when COVID came. I don't want to be a bitch to her but I feel like I sometimes am, because the annoyance makes me cranky to her. What do I do?  #128517;</TEXT>
