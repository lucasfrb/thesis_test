    <TEXT>I'm a cutter, I've been doing it for a while now. I got into it when everyone I ever trusted and everyone I thought cared left me and I got a sudden urge to hurt myself, its like sacrificing your own body for a relief even if its temporary. I want to stop but I always fail to hold on over a week before I do it again and recently getting worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes it's a matter of who are the people that love you and how they treat you that causes issues like that. Sometimes it's incredibly tough to find good qualities in youself when everyone around you treats you like trash. I agree with you but its very difficult for some and finding people who will actually treat you well and love you is also a thing that can help this situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Temporarily you can use makeup and long term you can use many creams exist for that purpose for example: mederma. And some essential oils like carrot seed oils supposedly help healing and discoloration I'd suggest you look into it. If your scars arent old give them a couple of month they will probably be alot less discolored.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup, keloids(Judgung by the look of it) are usually left by cuts that needed stitches, it's a result of tissue fibrosis that was caused by a deep wound that wasn't closed (in this case), if you would've gotten stitches or used other closing methods they probably would've been much smaller and not as "narly?".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah borderline keloids. I never used butterflies I prefer strips, but they're great, just make sure you follow safety intructions (don't pull them, don't wet until healed ect. You can find them online or ask me). If you need advice or have a question I'm open, good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it's normal they're called keloids they fade over time but may take a while (you can get surgery to make them fade instantly or use different methods at home). They are a result of tissue fibrosis (literally tissue turning into fibers) caused by a lot of damage to the original tissue and much of the damage can be mitigated scar wise by stitches they also would've healed faster (MUCH faster). So don't worry you're fine if you have any other questions I'm open.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have or rather had a super close friend, more than a brother, he was pretty much the only family, support and care I've had in 17 years of life. I spend everything on him, money wise time wise and everything I ever do I take him into consideration. And like he's drifting away pushed me to the side with "You have parents", funny how ironic it is, I haven't seen him privately in a month and I'm struggling with many other issues. Sometimes I plan suicides and shit, I never go according to plan for my dog. I feel like I'm not worth the time of anyone but it's not like that you,me we all are worth every bit of love in the world and everything well one person leaving could be a massive blow but you'll get over it eventually and it'll be all well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It'll be a small keloid probably (from experience) like deep red fiborous probably win't stick out much, it'll take about 3 weeks to heal completely and quite a while to fade out completely. Make sure it's clean and eat well, aloe vera, honey and things to keep it moisturized will help speed up healing process also bandages help. Burns are nasty. Makes me want to do it again.

    <TEXT>At this point bio oil won't help the scar has faded as much as it will. Laser treatment is honestly too extreme for this lol, I'm not sure doctor would agree to doing laser. Relax it's a few small scars nobody will ask anything and if they do you can say a friend's cat doesn't like you or something, people don't really care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you apply it constantly they might blend in a little, but permanently they won't change much. I know it's hard to accept them but you'll have to learn how, they are a part of you that symbolizes you surviving and you fighting, a product of the past. Some people even get attached to their scars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keloids are formed for unknown reasons, although pigmentation plays a factor (darker skin means higher risk for raised keloids) and depth plays a factor (obviously deeper means the scar will be more raised). Very deep burns (and burns you pop and pick) and picking fat can cause the scar to be sunken in unless the scar turns keloid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok look they're what's called keloid scars meaning an overloaded panic indused attemp of the body to heal the skin with fiborous collagen tissue resulting in raised scars that are often itchy and take a while to go white, they take UP TO 2.5 years for them to go white 100%, now this doesn't mean you should worry, keloid scars often vary in different people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>scars don't get tan they lack that pigmentation and therefore discoloured you can maybe try foundation or some other makeup product as a guy I don't understand anything about it but it seems to work seamlessly, you could also resort to sleeves which suck honestly.</TEXT>
