    <TEXT>Yes! It took me almost three months to finally start wearing long sleeves rolled up so I could roll them down if need be at my old job. Yet when I'm roaming the grocery store or popping into the McDonald's, I'll wear short shorts no problem! I'm much more comfortable at this new job and even wore shorts in front of my coworkers, but it's been like, two weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's good to hear. I made the decision to quit two days ago and...I've been two days clean (woohoo! lol). I'm less ashamed, more afraid of drawing eyes. I go out with my boyfriend, generally in shorts or short sleeves, and I've noticed the looks people give. I've had people comment. I don't want *him* to look bad. I've told him and he defends me saying things like "if people don't like it I don't want them in my life" and I appreciate it, but like...I don't want him to lose friends or any potential friendships because he is quite introverted. This is another issue I'm trying to sort out. Thank you, though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had the same problem until I learned how to cut deeper. I have so many that are decent but I hate them. If I had known what I know now I wouldn't have taught myself how to go deeper. Youre not fake and neither is your pain. Getting "better" scars only brings more internal issues along with a higher risk of messing up bigtime. I realized the cons outweighed the pros when I made my boyfriend cry. He thought he was going to lose me. Please, be safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its hard, I know. Just remember people care about you. What works for me is snapping myself with a hair tie. Its not ideal but it works if need be. If you have a nurse or therapist or someone else, be sure to talk to them about it. Their job is to help. If youve learned any other coping techniques be sure to use them. I wish you your best! /\^._.^/\</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It hurts a lot, you bleed a lot, and once theyre bad you think youre gross. You look at yourself and you say "Im disgusting, no one could possibly like me". You get paranoid and worry everyone's judging you. You have no choice but to fry in the summer sun, too self conscious to even roll your sleeves up. Even if this doesnt bother you, when youre sitting on your bed getting dizzy, fearing for your life, thinking about who you will hurt, you will be bothered. Im not trying to scare you nor am I trying to convince you not to. I want you to understand what can happen before you make the choice. You are a self-harmer, scars or not, just as you are in pain, symptoms or not. You are valid and your self harm is real. I advise against it, but who am I to tell you what to do? The only trick is to just keep going. Push harder and ignore the pain. Its as simple as that. I tried numbing, I tried warm water, I tried ice, I tried sharper tools, duller tools, various angles, but none of it made a difference. You literally just have to do it. Please dont. Ive been where you are, I fixed it, but now its my biggest regret. You can message me at anytime and Ill respond as soon as I can. Ill give you my discord if itll help. Edit: Im on phone reddit for the first time so I know I commented in the wrong place for which I am very sorry.  #128517;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What worked for me was snapping myself with a hair tie or rubber band in an emergency. If I was at home or had more time, Id write or doodle on my phone. I found if an urge was especially bad, chatting with a friend (not necessarily about the sh or urge though doing so may be additional support) while drawing on myself with washable marker also worked. Best of luck to you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many people go through many different things! I recently met someone who's been through things I never imagined were possible! I'm here, you're here, the rest of us are here, we all have at least one thing in common. The lot of us are a community and need to stand as such! With all the stigma and fear we all face, we as a community, need to trust each other to help each other. Sappy, I know! Stay strong and stay true to you. The only person you can guarantee you'll stay with your whole life is you, and yes, I said it in another post but it's true! I wish you the best life you want. P.S. I wouldn't say you're attention seeking, for the record. I made my own chart, too!</TEXT>
