    <TITLE>[Advice] Problem with alot of these productivity subs. Pseudo-productivity, you spend all time READING on how to be productive rather than actually doing something. It makes you feel like you're doing something "productive" but it actually isn't.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-04 13:38:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lots of people keep getting stuck in pseudo-productivity, instead of actually producing any results or actions. They go read books/subs on HOW to be productive, rather than actually doing it. This is a problem cause it **feels** like you are actually achieving something or being productive but you actually aren't. Alot of people I see here that thinks that there's some magic trick to it and try to read their way to productivity. Now, im not trying to say "just do it", however, you can always lay out a *good enough* plan in a short amount of time and start. If you want to do something, start now &amp; implement stuff to make that thing easier along the way, rather than hoarding a bunch of plans &amp; techniques and waiting until you have it all laid out. Most of this stuff can usually be tracked down to breaking a goal down into smaller steps, find out how to make those steps as easy and consistent as possible and doing them repeatedly until they develop into habits. That's why /r/theXeffect is probably the best productivity subreddit, it's one of the few subs where there's actually action taken. It's pretty small but I think you should check it out. It's the only sub that have had any real life impact for me. I do my "xeffect" cards, I see how it goes, if it goes well, I increase the difficulty or put my effort elsewhere, if it goes badly, I reflect on where it went wrong and try to lay out some principles to make it easier for me next time (e.g goal was to wake up earlier, went badly, started to reduce phone use before bed, it went better)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably starting too big or you make it too difficult for yourself. Better to start small and be consistent. You can also do things to make the goal *easier*: For example, if you want to wake up earlier, get an app blocker that blocks all distracting websites/apps an hour before bed. If you want to lose weight, always keep something healthy in the fridge and eat before you go to the grocery store (if you're full, then it's less likely that you will feel like buying sweets when there) If you want to study more, study the first thing when you wake up, your mind will be less clouded with other stuff when it's early (since nothing has happend today yet), and it's an easy way for your mind to build an habit (since it's a clear position and time that it's time to study, wake-up = study, saying that you should study during the day is too vague) However don't have too much faith in these "tricks", they are nice to implement while achieving your habits to make them easier ,however, most if it comes from starting easy and being consistent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those were just examples for what i meant by making something "easier", you didn't give me any specific habit to improve upon so I just picked sleep/weight loss/study since those are the most usual ones to provide an example.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true, however it doesn't need to be 100% reading &amp; 0% doing, sometimes those ratios are more equal but not weighted heavily enough towards doing. Also, it's easy for people to fail at something quickly &amp; go back to waiting it out by reading a bunch of articles, believing that if they fail then that must mean they are missing something (and they go read articles to find that 'something')</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My post wasn't intended as a full guide on how to achieve those goals or why they are important. Rather, I used simple changes to provide the point that you can implement things to make an habit more consistent by for example, changing the environment. I don't see why I need sources that say that you are more likely to buy food if you're hungry, or that phones are bad before sleeping. Also, the reason why people want to wake up early isn't to line it up with some optimal biological clock, it's usually just that it's easier to get things done if they do it at a time when most people are asleep since there's no messenges, urgent events, etc. You can calmly start your day. It's the same with the study time, your brain might be more optimized between those times, but that doesn't mean that it's easy to sit down and actually study (Maybe you have to pick your kids up at that time). It would be better to pick a good time in your schedule where you are sure that you will be able to get work done. That's why studying early might be good for alot of people, it has a solid cue (having a specific time &amp; location is good if you want to be consistent), no distractions and is probably not gonna crash with anything else on the schedule. Of course, it's good to take in consideration of how your energy levels work, your brain is high in ATP &amp; low in adenosine in the morning so scheduling around that is preferable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally better with a small amount of cards when you start out, however this depends on the difficulty too, multiple cards is fine if the cards are pretty easy. I would wait with the studying &amp; sleep one and just do the diet. You could make seperate cards or you could do something like this: https://i.redd.it/scb861ptb1y41.jpg https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/comments/iary8h/first_card_completed/ where you make notations for the different things, (upper legs of cross for fast food, lower for candy and dots for soda). But it's more a preference thing. Starting with all 3 at the same time might even be too much, but that kinda depends on how difficult those particular tasks are for you in this case, you could start with one of them and then add another habit every second week if it goes well. Biggest problem is that people take too much at the same time &amp; then they start failing which makes them discouraged and they drop the whole thing. Only a minority of cards that get posted on here gets finished cause they go from 0-100 too quick, it's usually the nice &amp; simple ones (see the tooth brushing one above) that do best in the longrun cause they produce encouragement &amp; a solid start to sprinboard off of. But again, it depends on how hard those tasks already are, if you eat candy/fast food/drink soda 50% of the time already then cuttting it out completely will probably end in a "failure", however if you already do them only once a week or something then it's probably not gonna be too difficult to cut them at the same time since the scale of change is smaller. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>there is nothing weird or wrong about a foot fetish. If anything, it is fun. I can't even imagine life without loving girls stinky cheesy feet. I am absolutely in love with them. The way they look, feel, taste and smell. It is plain to see that these kids just love them. It starts at all ages. And no they do not grow out of it. For me it has gotten stronger as I get older. They are sniffing your feet because they love that cheesy stinky smell. It is intoxicating. It is like a drug. When a girl takes off her shoes and let me smell her stinky cheesy feet, socks and sneakers, It feels like I am high, and send shivers all over my body. I get turned on like never before. Thank God that I was blessed with this amazing fetish. And thank God that I have only had 3 girls out of hundreds who have not let me smell and taste their yummy little feet. Sure some girls will say no at first and think it is a little strange because they have been programmed to think that girls aren't suppose to have stinky feet. As a child they The sex is the best ever. The power of that cheesy stink is so strong I * in about 2 minutes. And my explosions are very powerful and shoots everywhere over and over again. When I meet a girl and go to her house. I always go through her hamper when she is not around, looking for her stinky stinky sweat socks, panties and shoes. I have stolen plenty=P. Anyways...let your little boys and girls have fun with sniffing your yummy female feet and hump the floor all they want. Do not tell them it's bad or gross. You do not do that to a child. That's like telling a child to not masturbate. Let them explore their bodies and love them. As for me, I never have been attracted to pantyhose. I am more attracted to white socks and sneakers. As for my mother? hell no. That is just nasty to me. But my sister use to make me smell and suck her feet and toes after cheerleading practice because they would get so stinky. I was only 6 and she was 11. I will never forget her coming home every single day and calling me to her room as she demanded me remove her stinky cheesy socks. She would then put her feet in my face. They were very cute, small and smelled of very strong cheese and sweat. I would instantly get a hard on and start sucking them and sniffing them. She would just lay back on the bed and moan with her eyes closed, then look down at me making sure I clean out everything from between her plump juicy little toes. I think she was masturbating because after a while I would her her moan real loud and her hips thrust and then she would relax and tell me that's enough for now. She was nice enough to let me use her stinky cheesy shoes and socks because she knew I was gonna go to my room and masturbate while sniffing them and sucking out all the salty/sweet stink=P. So anyways...I think that is how my fetish started. Let your future kids have fun with your feet and your female friends feet. They will have an amazing fun filled life=) &#65279;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people will say that you dream is impossible. Some people will say that you're not good at gaming. Some people will say that you're not clever at being smart. Some people will say you've got bad breath. Well to those people I says lay down and have some tap water and lay down and achieve your dream and lay down and have some cigarettes you see life is not about getting coins or doing drugs or how many fingers you can fit in or getting a job or playing games. Life's about being a gamer and achieving a dream and life is like a tightrope and if you fall off you're just a bag of shit and life is your chance to do a dream for free and here is a quote from nirvana's kirt cuban "if you're not there for me at my best then you not deserved for me to be there for my lowest". Sometimes we all need to look at the stars in the sky and throw our wii remotes on the ground and shout "I CAN DO IT FOR FREE" so stop drinking apple juice and stop flushing the toilets and stop going to work and school and stop having showers and baths and stop counting the volcanoes and start counting the girl gamers because you can only live this day once do something epic like throw a hedgehog down the stairs. Today is the day to start living your life today. Is your dream to be a boxer? Go and punch someone. Is your dream to be a zookeeper? Go steal some pets. Is your dream to be a real gamer then watch my vids. Sometimes we let emotions control us and sometimes we sneeze, sometimes we have diarrhoea, sometimes we break our spine but today you will change you will reach your goals you will be the man on the TV you will be the winner of the lottery you will be the stain on the carpet you will be the man who sells worms you will be a millionaire and you will have a chest infection you can achieve this goal! This dream and this fantasy you've just got to have faith and never give up, never stop trying and never question yourself and n-n-n-n-never wash your hair and never use protection. Ladies squeeze your boob, men squeeze your balls we can do this together we can be the greatest gamers in the world all it takes is your heart and mind and soul.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I&#8217;ve seen this girl several times already and every time she keeps making eye contact with me. She always dresses super nice and has such a good sense of fashion. Today, I accidentally bumped into her and grabbed her waist unconsciously to prevent myself from falling. I immediately apologized but what surprised me is she didn&#8217;t even back off and glanced at me with a so particular seductive look of hers. As we were still in physical contact, I looked around to see if anyone witnessed which would&#8217;ve make it quite awkward but thankfully we were alone. Her face was still so close to mine and her head almost fell into mine as she was reaching out for a kiss, I knew she wanted that. Well, I got kinda caught up in the heat of the moment. I put my hand on her chest and caressed her, then slowly started unzipping her shirt, while always keeping an eye on her face to see if she showed any sign of repulsion, but she just let me do it. The moment has finally come. I grabbed it. It felt different than what I would&#8217;ve imagined it but very good nonetheless. I kept on playing with it for around a minute and it was probably the best time of my life. Then I got kicked out of the clothing store.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought I was supposed to place nicht always infront of the article but, apparently it sometimes goes to the end of the sentence? For example, my textbook says: Nein, ich esse die Suppe nicht. Would it be wrong to say: Nein, ich esse nicht die Suppe?
