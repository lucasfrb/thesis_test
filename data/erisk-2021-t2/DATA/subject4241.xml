    <TEXT>Leveling used to be a hell of a lot harder though. Picked up the game again like a month ago and it's amazing how much faster you level up. Back when I started around launch time it took me months just to get to 22 even though I was a pretty active player. Now even with the exponential increase in exp requirements I've leveled up almost 10 lvls in a month. If it was back then I probably only would have leveled up 3 maybe 4 times in the same time frame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bro that pissed me off during the Deoxis raids last week. Some lvl 30 guy dropped out last second so it was just me and one other dude fighting the deoxis but both of us had a full teams of hard counters so we managed to get it to like 15% health before we ran out of time. If my team hadn't consisted mainly of pokemon 1500-2000 cp we probably would have beaten it with just 2 people but oh well. Didn't have many strong dark types at the time so I had to make do. At least I only wasted a free raid pass the other guy didnt seem to be as lucky</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That really depends. You can get away with some pretty low cp pokemon if they're hard counters. I almost beat deoxis with 1 other player at lvl 35 with a team of dark types with an overall average of like 1800 cp. If they were in the 2200 range we probably would have beaten it but the point is compatibility is arguably more important than cp. After all a pokemon that deals 256% damage and only receives 24-39% will still fair better than a neutral pokemon with twice the cp dealing and receiving 100% damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea but it's annoying they cant keep their own lore consistent like ok the serum is supposed to make him the apex of human performance not turn him superhuman. I'm glad they at least decided to make his speed a reasonable 40 mph cause that's the max speed a human could hypothetically attain before their feet no long maintain a sufficient amount of time to get the traction need to propel themselves forward but everything else is bullshit. I've read batman is supposed to be stronger than him yet you never see batman holding down helicopters with the strength of his raw bicep plot armor before. I'm just saying if you're gonna put restraints on a character respect them. Well dc also pulls bs like that too especially with superman.</TEXT>

For like a solid week or two I'd use it to clear every egg in my inventory to stock up on 10k eggs.

I've pretty much gotten every single pokemon this months batch has to offer except for and audino and golet but I dont care about those so it's fine. Anyways did you get it recently or was it a while ago? Worldwide egg spawns are pretty much the same with a handful of pokemon being limited to a specific region but neither riolu or pidove are on the list atm so itd be strange to see either of those this month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thata not it. Since creselia is fairly new people are flooding friend request inboxes. First day I hosted a raid and got 40 friend request in 5 minutes the yesterday it calmed down to about 20 request in 5 min but it's still a lot. Honestly the main thing that screws you over is what your name is and your timing. If you send a request first your request is getting pushed all the way to the bottom by the newer request and if your name starts with a z or something your name is gonna be towards the bottom when they go to send invites. It's all up to luck but when 20 other people are also vying for a spot your chances arent good. Just wait a couple days when everyones got their shines or 100 IVs there will be a lot less competition just dont wait too long or you wont be able to get enough people to do a raid at all</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly it depends. We remodeled the shit out of our house and it came out pretty nice. New carpet ,laminate floors, paint, counter tops, cabinets, toilets, light fixtures/ceiling fans, glass doors on the shower where the tub used to be as well as new tiles and decorative accents, stone tiles around the fireplace, etc. We also built the shed in our backyard, replaced the boiler around 2-3 years ago as well as the dead motor on our air conditioner. Overall I'd say we've saved tens of thousands of dollars by doing it ourselves with good results. If I can do it myself then I wont pay someone else to do it. Only things I won't fuck with are phone repairs cause they really make those things a bitch to fix yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Riolu just has a low hatch rate. It took me 13 attempts to hatch it from a 10k and it was only a 2 star. You just gotta keep grinding it, hatch as many trash eggs as possible then restock. Avoid opening gifts if you have an empty egg space. It was about 800k between my first attempt and finally getting riolu since 10k eggs dont spawn often either. The other 670k was spent getting rid of trash eggs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're running charm you pretty much gotta commit to beating a pokemon to death with your fast move only cause you'll probably only get one shot off. That's why I typically start off with a fast proccing pokemon to take out their shields first. I think alolan raichu with volt switch and thunder punch is a good balance between a high dps and quick charge moves but people run a lot of dark types to be ready for it to get countered. A popular fast procc pokemon for the current season is obstagon with I think counter and nightslash since counter can deal with other dark types and steal types which are both fairly common rn meanwhile nightslash is good for chip damage or shield baiting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea people are over exaggerating probably due to the trauma that was the creselia raids since that one was near impossible with less than 6 people but articuno has a quad weakness and is not nearly as tanky so its considerably easier to beat. Yesterday I beat it with 4 other level 30s and one level 12 with a little more than half the time left. If we consider the 12 as an invalid then you're right 5 people is more than enough. Even 4 people is enough and honestly I'd even say 3 level 30s is pushing it but with well built teams I think they should still be able to take it down with relative ease.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on the boss. Articuno is quad weak and has a lower defense stat so 3 or 4 people should be relatively easy. Creselia despite having a significantly lower cp had a much higher defense stat and no quad weaknesses which is why that one would take at least 6 people. Just look up the recomended teams and party sizes for raid bosses on the silph road and itll tell you how easy it is. Articuno is rated as easy with 4 people with any combo of the top 12 counters powered up to level 25 so theoretically 4 level 25 players can easily beat articuno.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its weird for them all to leave at the same time. Especially considering how many people there were chances are they were probably kicked before it started. It's happened to me before. Had a heatran raid I was hosting with my two younger brothers and someone I met on reddit. We had like 9 people in the raid but as soon as it started one of my brothers got kicked and so did the person I met through reddit as well as two others. Then towards the end of the raid I think the others were also kicked cause we almost beat the heatran but it was reduced to just my brother and me so we were barley unable to beat it. If I was by myself I would've been salty assuming everyone ditched me but since I was able to talk to my brothers and the person from reddit I found out it was a technical glitch.</TEXT>

Wouldnt have had to cut it so close if one moron didnt decide to leave before it started like seriously? Four people is enough to beat it with ease assuming you build your team correctly which was honestly my fault for not checking my brothers team but this guy decided to leave when we had 5 people which is basically a guaranteed win.</TEXT>

I also discovered the first imposter so I thought ppl would have trusted me more and I kept on pointing out how pink would make fuck up after fuckup but did they vote them out, no. Bunch of morons. We ended up losing cause they voted out the guy that was with me on cameras when I found the person pink killed. Like c'mon yall got the memory of a goldfish. Pink made so many sloppy mistakes and you guys vote out the guy that had an alibi. Not even mad that the imposter won I was just disappointed at how incompetent my teammates were.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They look like generic steel toe shoes. Idk why but they got popular. I guess some ghetto dude saw the price tag and decided it was fresh as fuck just cause they were expensive so then everyone started wearing constructions shoes. The brand then rode the momentum and started doing more fashionable designs but I still think it was an incredibly stupid trend. Like really? Construction shoes? Poor people really try to flex in the weirdest ways especially when it comes to shoes. Like motherfuckers be dropping over $200 on Jordan's basketball shoes but would never dare to run in them much less actually play basketball for fear of creasing the leather. Similarly most of these dudes wearing Timberlands have probably never set foot in a construction zone. Guess they think more expensive equals more stylish or something.</TEXT>

Like what is the point in cheating to win a game where there is no incentive to win other than to have fun? Theres no ranks or rewards just a victory screen you look at for 2 seconds. I heard that a lot of people are doing it to troll randoms in public matches for youtube videos but I doubt there should be this many.

    <TEXT>This honestly does happen though. Sometimes the imposter will say something that makes it a dead giveaway that the snitch is teaming and despite knowing damn well who the real imposter is I will go out of my way to frame the snitch and vote him off. I'll also admit afterwards I knew he wasnt an imposter and just wanted to get rid of him just to piss his dead ass off cause fuck cheaters, ruins the entire premise of the game. My brother told me that teamings been popular lately for youtube videos and he's probably right cause I got voted out as imposter cause a teaming little shit snitched and he tried to trigger me afterwards in the ghost chat but I was pretty apathetic so he lost interest and left the game.

    <TEXT>Not sure if you worded it poorly but it sounds like you don't understand how herd immunity works. Btw there are plenty of vaccines that save lives the reason you dont know about them is cause vaccines have nearly eradicated them entirely such as polio, smallpox, measles, etc. Polio alone killed or paralyzed around half a billion people world wide. And in case you really dont know what herd immunity is it's the decrease in likelyhood of a few unnvaccinated members of a populace to contract a disease from another since the majority of the populace is immune or resistant to it due to vaccinations which makes it harder for it to spread. Ever since the whole autism bs started measles which was thought to be eradicated was brought back due to the weakened herd immunity as more people refuse to get vaccinated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To whoever replied for some reason I can't find your comment but i read the first few words on my notifications so I got the gist of it, here you go. Herd immunity the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune to the disease, especially through vaccination. Taken straight from the default google dictionary. On a side note herd immunity is meant to protect those with autoimmune disorders who cant take vaccines due to medical reasons.

    <TEXT>if the imposter hints that they're teaming I'll vote the cheater off first. I've been in games where I help the imposters vote off cheaters .Then I go and rub it in the cheaters face before we vote off the real imposter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you start spouting profanities that'll get you kicked faster. I'll vote people I dont think are imposters cause watching them throw tantrums is annoying too. Try asking nicely and maybe they'll help you out cause cheaters are pretty much universally hated so people probably wont mind taking a loss. After all teaching teaming bastards a lesson is more rewarding than the little victory screen</TEXT>

I don't know what definition you're trying to use but you can't cherry pick information just cause the general consensus doesn't support your views.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was in one where me and this dude saw someone scan and that dude voted him off even though he watched them scan. And no, he wasn't an imposter just really stupid. I think what makes the game more challenging is stupid people. Like sometimes someone is so terrible at the game you are pretty much positive they're an imposter but truth is they just suck ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel you pvp gets pretty hard when you have to go up against people with nothing but legacy moves. I mean it's still possible to win if you're skilled enough with sack swapping, strategizing, and other things but you're at a severe disadvantage if you don't also have those moves. Honestly the introduction of those moves is pretty game breaking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you not faced a legacy move user yet? Hydro cannon is basically surf on steroids. Not only does it charge faster it also deals more damage. Frenzy plant and blast burn are also pretty nasty. They take slightly longer than hydro cannon but they're basically the equivalent of overheat and solar beam the difference is blast burn doesnt have a debuff while frenzy plant deals less damage than solar beam but charges much faster. Other than those three the other nastiest legacy move is meteor mash on metagross. Deals the same damage as flash cannon but has almost the same charge time as psychic. Worst part is you cant really tank the hits cause they're all heavy hitting moves it doesnt matter if you single or quad resist it. It will chunk your health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Theres also some fast tm legacy moves but the only one I can think of that actually hurts is dragon breath. Has a low damage but a really high dps so it'll quickly drain your health kinda like charm does. Similarly to charm though cause of it's high dps it also charges slowly though it does charge faster than charm but not by much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I caught 10 or more shiny charmanders and most of them were 0 stars. Only like 2 had 1 or 2 stars so I decided to trade with my brother brother in hopes of getting a lucky trade since that usually guarantees itll have good IV's. Didnt get a lucky trade but it did become a 96% so that was pretty dope. My brothers also ended up with 3 stars. Maybe its cause it was a special trade. You should try trading with someone and maybe itll also become a 3 star.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what I was planning but we didnt get a lucky trade and it still became a 3 star. It might be cause it's a special trade cause it's a shiny so it might have a chance of greatly increasing its IV'S for everyone.</TEXT>
