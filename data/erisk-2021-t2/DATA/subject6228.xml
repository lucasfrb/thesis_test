    <TEXT>I got my P1 on a 2nd try, 1st spin by the McClaren cards no dice, then paid 100G for the 2nd spin, in old event structure you couldn't touch half of it w/o an existing McClaren, and could maybe get only 550 (250 for first win+300 for class cars) cards a day. If you already have cars  gt;550PI's more possible. Knowing it's limited time I got greedy and blew 1300G on spins (3rd copy by spin 9 so I was hopeful). Just 1 copy short of 4\* ing it dangit! Still with only 529PI in new McC event I managed to take out the low-end event cars (550 amp;560PI, the 560 was an F1). The launch is twitchy, perfect near impossible but even an overgas your accel is still great, just start out a shade low on the nitro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like sometimes it pays to miss a perfect corner, to not have to sit on a double boost, at least in races w/  lt;25PI difference. DD 1st corner, if you just missed perfect launch, a double perfect corner gives you double nitro, and that leg feels too short for benefit of a double boost. Bayside having a double boost for the last leg feels useless unless you're pretty tight w/ opp on last turn. That's my least favorite. If I'm not tight on opp bumper or leading in that 3rd turn, I seldom win from behind. Should I sit on a double boost after that turn until mid tunnel? SB I don't double boost 2nd leg unless I get it within a second of exiting the corner. Otherwise I'll blow the single boost, be full up entering leg three (assuming at least great brake amp;gas corner 2), blast near immediately, and by the time you hit turn 3 you're near 1 boost entering the corner, and 1.5-1.9 exiting. Just in general if I feel like I will be  gt;1.5 full by the time I enter the next corner, I do a single blast in the first half of the leg (to either close the gap or widen if leading, or shrink my lead less if opp is double boosting from behind me). Short of a late brake/early gas combo, you pick up at least a half boost in a corner, so sitting on the double boost through the whole turn feels a waste.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Always do the daily challenge. Premium card per day, gets you mostly 2* dupes which will eventually get a few of your cars to 4*. The class upgrade events have lots of era/class chips, even if I can #8217;t dominate sometimes I #8217;ll run another path just to pick up class chips. I see you have a P1 too. I got one on 2nd spin, then blew 1400g to get only 3 dupes, 1 short of 4 starring it! Argh. Maybe woulda been better off w/ 1350g of premium cards</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a P1 pulled on 2nd draw, spent 1400G more on trying to get it to 4\*, to only get to 3.75 stars... so close. I have an outside chance of pulling another in the remaining McClaren event once I hit 15 spins, but won't hold my breath. 20% odds each McC card but bet most of them are 2\* 570s.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>3* double down - take it if it makes you 4*</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-21 06:59:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you ever get a 3\* double down offer for pulling a dupe (not sure if it only happens when you pull a 3\* dupe?), might be worth taking especially if you are at 3.75\* (and the double down would make your car a 4\*). I think I goofed by turning down the offer. I got that offer an a Charger r/T midway thru the spotlight week... at 3.5\*, spun a 3\* charger, and got that offer (400G for another 3\* dupe, 500 3\* chips, and 500 epic chips or something like that). Was thinking, eh, 85G per paid spin plus rack up enough chips to get a spotlight card a day, thought I could easily swing another Charger during the event... unlucky though. 0 for 4 on the spotlight cards, finally got another Charger on the 4th paid card... but 2\*!! Doh! Forgotten that most spotlight cars are 2\* rare. So I would have been better off taking up the double down offer, to have gotten my first 4\* car (rare too). Previously made the same mistake(?) with a retro M3 (also at 3.75\* after a good draw, got the offer, (forgot the price). But I was thinking why do I need my first 4\* as a retro when EP2 is Modern and EP3 is Classic? But a super high PI 4\* of any type would be helpful progressing and dominating unrestricted races. If the double down takes you from 3.5 to 3.75\*, not so sure though. It puts you closer to getting a 4\* car, but I got my Boss 302 to 3\* long before I had a single Charger r/T, but somehow i pulled way more dupes of the latter in the last week or 2, after I had sunk lots of upgrades into the Boss 302. So luck of the draw may have your car that was ahead in dupes leapfrogged when you least expect it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah OK makes sense. The upgrade parts a total waste agree. But the 3* dupe, on a rare car, even if you buy 400g of premium cards, or of spotlight cards, will take a while (3x 2* dupes... at 20% odds in a spotlight week) What do you spend gold on then?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just autorace 1:1:1 at level 2. 2 races, 3gas, an OK ratio. That nets 400 chips and no cards. If there #8217;s a 3 race path anywhere that can net 900 chips, then you #8217;ll get a level 1 card and 400 chips (at your current level). I #8217;m guessing tho that farming 1:1:1 @400 chips a pop is still more efficient. Most later paths intersperse races  amp; items 1 to 1, while 1:1:1 is 2to 1 If I #8217;m auto racing thru spotlight or wherever I just try to calculate chip count for that path w/ 400 leftover. Say on a 4 race path, do all 4 at +100 (just 400 chips), or 3x+200  amp; 1x+300 (=1 card  amp; 400 chips)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But you #8217;re unlikely to 4* it until next year #8217;s event unless you #8217;re ready to drop 2000g, so it #8217;ll be cool to have, but stuck at it #8217;s star level, no chance at lucky draws on premium or 3* cards or spotlight events. I think you have 50% odds of getting one within 5 spins (@20% odds per spin last week for a P1 - the 570s this week is 60%, but only 2* common, so you #8217;ll need 4 draws, about 6-7 paid cards, just to get it to 3*). I got a P1 2nd spin, then blew 1400g to get it to 3.75* and ran outta gold. Close, no cigar. Maybe if I #8217;m lucky I #8217;ll get another copy on one of the later event spins this month (20% odds of an unspecified McC per event card), but not counting on it, betcha most will be 2* 570s</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, did it myself. Double boosted going up the ramp at Bayside and was leading all the way up, but the Charger RT squeaked by in the last race of spotlight. So I blew 3 wrenches for a rematch, and spun him on turn 3 with a double boost barely out of the exit yellow zone when he slipped ahead on that turn in the rematch. How do you record the screenshot?

    <TEXT>Awesome, thanks for the heads up. Install Java. Open the listed port given by Samsung (at least temporarily), port forwarding on your router. THEN, reserve and start your virtual phone. I stalled out in my first try w/o the port open, it just said connecting forever. Then it took me a while to figure out how to get to the virtual phone home screen. Click one of the side virtual buttons (the single one is home/lock, the other pair is likely up/down volume). Took me a while to figure out how to get through the tutorial and first races on the virtual Galaxy. If you hold down the mouse on the button long enough it just locks, so I was not releasing/braking in the corners when I let go of the mouse button, repeated crashes, I thought it was the lag. Once I figured out, release and click on the pedal again to brake, then click again to hold and gas. Then once it's been long enough you can release and click on boost. The Mustang GT is meh, but the extra copy made it my first 4\* car. Now to decide, upgrade this, or keep on plodding with my 35th Anniv Camaro (at 528 PI, 3.25 star so it will be a while before it hits 4\*). W/ only one half decent muscle car prior (Boss 302 at 519PI) it took forever just to get the Camaro to this point (never can dominate muscle exhaust events to get 2 at a pop). I already had the Vette Z06 so now a shade closer to 4\* too. Yay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really like this list, would be good to put some numbers behind it, e.g., for each track users can input PI  amp; finish time. Sure times will vary by driver, but will tend toward an average. I was using an upgrade event (totally outclassed by a 535PI 911 classic) to test my Miura 478PI vs 904 @ 476PI. Mid 52s on South Beach for the Miura, but never got the 904 below 53sec in 6 tries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cool. I think maybe a 2nd sheet/form where users can add one row per entry. Car, PI, track, time. Maybe weekly you weed out the typos/mistakes like 100 sec finish times, PI  lt;400, etc, and copy/append the new entries to a permanent database/ sheet Then a pivot table output from that database linked to the front page guide. Listing, avg PI, avg time per track. Maybe also week of entry. If they tweak performance over time there maybe shifts. Dunno if any need to distinguish story/upgrade/rivals mode but it #8217;s already complex enough just with track Pi  amp; time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah the F1 is same odds: 10,11, 14%,... your odds of NOT getting one in N# paid spins is 90% x 89% x 86% x... so usually by spin 5-6 you have 50% odds of having spun one, and so on after each reset. 4 inside of 16 spins was a bit ahead of house odds, but a 3.0* (1 copy) P1 upgrades just as high as a 3.75* (4 copy)  #128541;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Race Database added to ForzaStreet Car rankings page</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-22 18:06:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Wanted to put some real numbers behind the various opinions on the Best cars ranking sheet kindly put together by leesonreddit so with their permission added a new tab labeled "Race Results Database". [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uliYI-CDk5NIgJuuyzogk0N2oiKE6zMzyoxRBVAtmzM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uliYI-CDk5NIgJuuyzogk0N2oiKE6zMzyoxRBVAtmzM/edit?usp=sharing) Enter your car, PI at the time, track, and runtime (seconds). Looking for sort of average-ish or good times, if you blew the start and all turns, don't bother putting in that run, but if you get a perfect and OK, they kind of cancel out in my current calculation. I'm going off the end of race stats/map listing of FULL perfects (not the rivals mode x25 pts count of half perfects). If you don't remember exactly don't worry, the default assumption is equivalent to straight goods. Also don't really want runs where you were testing boost abstinence, more a "used what you could in a tight race" scenario, even if in reality the opponent was way ahead or way behind, more a kind of time trial indicator. If you also don't know your time beyond tenths of a second, also don't worry. Looking to get a sense of truly vs perceived fast or slow cars, not times to the 0.001 second. For now not distinguishing between story / upgrade / spotlight / rivals / races, although we could add that if someone thinks it makes a difference to YOUR car's time, not the opponent's. Once we get enough entries some kind of average time and PI by track can be put on the front tab so that people can judge. If we get super fancy maybe at some point we normalize it to estimated average time at PI500 or some other way to make it less lopsided if one car has a lot of people with high PIs entering and another with only low PIs. With average PI and average time by track at least though you can see which cars are punching above their PI or below for a given track. Maybe include an average +/- of perfect/OK to also help people qualitatively factor in (especially important if not many entries for the given car/track combo) how good the drivers were behind a particular avg number.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you looking for a car just to have or to use? I would say just try your luck at McClaren cards until the last day you can directly buy a 720 spin, and if you're happy where you're at, leave it be. If not, try and buy spins to get it. If you're trying to crank it up to usable status, it's unlikely to get to the 4\* status of some of your current fleet w/o at least 2000g - you'd need total 15? draws of 2\* cars? Getting it to 3\* (3 draws of 2\* cards) is more reasonably possible though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've noticed like the last half dozen spins it seems like they always tease you with a 3\* car in the position just before it stops on the actual car you get assigned with a car spin. Others have said the spin is done/car assigned even if they shut down the app mid spin, so I think it's just the FS crew toying with our psychology. The car is assigned the instant you hit claim, and the spinny thing is just visuals, into which they stuff a 3\* car right before the car you actually won. Am I nuts or are other people feeling a disproportionate % of spins show a 3\* right before the one you won?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They could easily fix that by locking out switches of  gt;20PI or whatever limit they set, e.g. you can #8217;t switch to any car not within 20PI already. Then increase the points for initial PI of opponent. I #8217;m kinda lazy, any opponent in the +10 range or more I just go with it. I did try switching once vs a modern skyline +44pi, crazy launch but slow in the straights. Dunno why rivals performance is ever different from story.

    <TEXT>That's one thing I wish they had in ForzaStreet, being able to half boost at will. Yah maybe they want to keep the controls simple, but doesn't seem like it would be too hard to differentiate a double boost, e.g. double tap, or holding on the nitro for longer than a half rotation or something similar. Often I'll be coming in somewhere (DD turn 2) where I know I can't sit on a double nitro until the next turn so I intentionally try and miss the turn timing a bit to avoid getting a full double. Maybe the AI car is similarly crippled, sometimes I see them blasting into a turn, wonder if they're in a similar bind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Getting repeated tuneups to get to the next upgrade level is getting to be a drag. Is there any way to set up an autogrinder on phone (or even desktop) to just spam Ep1:1:1 and convert energy into chips (story, ep 1, part 1, event 1, click thru talking heads, select car, start, pick first race, set to level 2, autorace, click next race, click thru talking heads, set level 2, autorace, lather rinse repeat until you're out of energy (or just manually specify number of cycles to run given your energy meter). I looked into Apple Shortcuts on iOS but the app list it will interact with is pretty limited. I can sort of do it half paying attention while watching TV or whatever but that's additional thumb RSI on top of playing  #128540; There are probably more options on Windows desktop , if you fullscreen the game, the control locations are more predictable. I remember way back there was a keystroke recorder automator that could handle keystroke shortcuts, for FS I think it would need to be a mouse recorder type thing. I have an Android phone too (Moto X Pure) but dunno if it's too old a generation to handle FS and/or whether there's automation software/apps that would work on that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you'll notice off on the right on the database sheet there's a proto pivot table summary of average by car and track (for PI, time, and net perfects) for the data, which should auto update as records are added to the database. Also did a crude scatterplot regression on it (time vs PI) and it fits the general pattern, higher PI = lower time, although there are faster and slower cars within the scatter of data. Clicking on individual points, the ones that fall below the line tend to be ones with more net perfects, so trying to figure a way to convert those into an approximate common metric, to try and isolate good car effect from good driver impact. It won't be exact, but maybe as a first cut, what do y'all think is an average time impact of a full perfect on run time on a typical course. E.g. straight goods, vs straight perfects. Is 0.25 sec each about right (1 sec per race)? It feels like the right ballpark, knowing my course times in good runs vs totally meh ones typically run about a second off give or take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course they #8217;re just trying to get you to spend real $ to buy virtual gold to get more spins. Two of my guaranteed spins were 570s too, but at least one was a 3*. Grinding to level it up enough to compete at lowest tier in McClaren event, short some sports exhausts. At 514PI now I might beat the 550 on a good day? The 560 tho no shot. I took it up vs the 570 just for yuks (used the P1 on the low tier already), nothing but space the whole way, was hoping if I could stay with it to the first corner I could try ramming it. If you lose the finale race and quit you keep the chips but lose the crate, right? Wasted a lot of gold to get a P1 to 3.75* silly me, but if I get super lucky or they bring it back week 6 maybe I can 4* it. Also spun a 2* 720s on one of the non guaranteed ones. Not bothering to upgrade tho unless I luck out and 3* it soon enough before end of event, since it #8217;ll max out at 505PI as a 2*?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny how that works, you stay weak in the classes you're weak to start with (since you have trouble winning or dominating class upgrade events, and thus also winning the car spin chips for that class in the upgrade events). Right now stuck trying do decide between upgrading a Camaro 35th at 3.3\* (upgrade level 7) 537PI vs Mustang GT that just flipped to 4\* (upgrade level 4) 505PI. The Camaro was first to 3\*, but then a few spins and the Samsung S20 promo (posted previously), and the Mustang leapfrogged it. I only recently spun up a Charger SRT and a dupe (2.3\*) so long way from having it useful for Episode 2. I got through Ep 2 by finally upgrading the Camaro enough, and could eventually dominate Ep2 w/ enough time/patience at its current state. Similar quandry on classic muscle. Boss 302 at 3.3\* upgrade level 5, Charger r/T at 3.8\* upgrade level 3. Getting thru Ep3 needs getting one of those into the hi 500's. Somewhat more sunk into the Boss but needs maybe only 1-2 weeks of upgrade events to bring them even (although those same parts would make the Boss better enough to make upgrade events easier- catch 22). I guess if I'm OK just chilling and slowly chipping away at dominating Ep 2, then maybe one of those will just flip to 4\* on spins and help make the decision for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you can dominate some of the story parts you haven't already finished (50g per part, 100g per episode?), you might get to buy another spin or 2 (200g). The last days of P1 I was scrambling to squeeze in a few more spins (to get from 3.75\* to 4\*), managed to get 200g/2 more spins, but struck out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now that I've gotten a P1 I've gone exclusively to pointer/index finger launch instead of thumb. Thumb is much slower, and I just try and work out a rhythm of tapping (Tap Tap Revenge!) that keeps the throttle peaking into or maybe slight thru the green zone. A lot of overgas with the P1 but at least the launch speed is still passable even with that (keeping up/ahead of most cars, just low on starting nitro). Slow start is deadly for a P1 so I try and err high for that car especially. What's your preferred launch technique?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unless you have Sports  amp; Supers w/ high enough PI to dominate the upgrade events it could take a while to get your new McL's competitive (else you win only one part per upgrade day taking the easiest path). That's my problem now. My P1 at 543PI could take on the 570PI middle tier and win another card, but beating the 580PI finale is a stretch. My 570s at 514PI might be able to take out the 550PI, but again 560PI is a stretch. Dominating w/ 3 McL's for now is a pipe dream. Maybe in week 5? If you're sitting on a lot of unused sports and super exhausts from prior weeks you could level up faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone else suggested a well timed thumb mash held down. It will repeatedly bounce after pegging but if you time the initial mash right it #8217;s rebounding thru the green zone. So far I #8217;m 2 over gas and one perfect trying to mash on the max of the 2 countdown. Might try other timings too. I may stick to index finger for less twitchy cars though else you have to remember separate timing for each car. They all react differently on the thumb mash or release whereas the index tap through the countdown you can increase the tap rate to get the peak moving higher or skip a beat if you overshot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting. There were times I late braked for those shallow turns on SB  amp; Bayside, and amazed they didn't blow by me, other times I hit double perfects and they passed so wondering what was up with that. No lift at all is taking it to an extreme, wonder if a late microlift to get a least a good gas on those shallow turns give you enough boost meter to not have to wait until late in the Bayside garage/underpass to double in case you didn't nail both parts of turn 3. And in South Beach sometimes left wondering is opp. going to double boost before I can hit mine (haven't yet worked out where in SB final stretch to give up on possibly double boosting and just use what you got to maybe hold on- wait until they flip to a rear view movie of opp boosting? Or is there a good set spot, if you don't have double boost by here use your single regardless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I now have both a P1 (543PI) and 570s (528PI) so can win 2 of the McL chip sets at the end. In chasing a 3rd, if I only have 1000g, should I go for F1 or Senna? I'm assuming no shot at 4\*ing either this year. F1 is now so it gives me more time to get it into the mix for McL event is the only advantage I can think of. For retro events I already got my 1991 M3 up to 4\* 530PI, so other than the doh! move of taking it to the street path today (I have a 323ti at 550PI, but my next highest retro is a Countach at 487PI, bye bye 200 chips) I already have something to take on the era path in events when it's generic retro. Maybe I should get a backup plan in the retro range, although my Diablo is only at 3.1\* on the dupes, while my Countach is at 3.9. Both I could eventually get to 4\* just on spins, but an F1 not til next year's event presumably (if I'm even still playing that far out). Decisions decisions.</TEXT>

Then the charger RT spotlight happened so I did that hoping to spin some boss dupes, or charger dupes leading to classic muscle chips leading to boss spins, then lo  amp; behold my 2* charger was suddenly 3.75* (but still at 471PI) vs my Boss stuck at 3.25*. So I #8217;m sort of waiting until I hit an unbeatable classic muscle in Ep3 before committing to upgrading one of those further. Hopefully one pops into 4* territory. I did some of the spotlight this week even tho I had no interest in that car, because the multiple dupes = many street retro chips, one of which finally flipped my 91 bmw m3 into 4*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s confusing but I think the event cards won with McL chips are different from the bought spins. Bought spins have higher odds for the featured McL. Chip spins have same odds regardless of week (20% odds for one McL, unspecified, but if you slow spin to start just to see the typical roster, it #8217;s like 2/3 570s). Not the same as spotlight where bought and chip spins are all one counter. I think? that means if you really want a Z06 and all you can manage is to dominate spotlight tier 1  amp;2 daily this week (a Z06 spin per day) on day 7 if your luck is bad, you only have to buy 3 spins for a guaranteed Z06?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you haven #8217;t finished Ep 1, 112 is better. If started Ep 2 or 3, depends..You need credits or high value tuning kits more? Need Credits run 112. Tuning kits, run 111, BUT ONLY FOR 400 chips (0 cards) even if you could auto race for 600 event total (1 card  amp; 100 chips) because the card odds for a level 5 kit are stuck at Ep 1 odds (where you earned it), but the chips are redeemed at your current Ep completion odds. Odds of a level 5 kit double at Ep 2, quadruple at Ep 3. So getting 1/3 less points more than offset by the double odds of high value kits</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Winning odds 510PI vs 550PI (McL event)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-29 21:32:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday must've been a fluke and the AI drove really bad because today my F1 stuck at 510PI (short a super exhaust to up PI any more), was 0 for 6 (I tried 3 rounds of repair) vs the McL event F1 at 550PI (lowest tier). I'm not the best driver out there by far, I get maybe 25-35% double perfects, 50% half perfect/greats or double greats, and the rest a motley crew. How do you folks usually do on your odds vs a +40PI (not in Rivals, story/spotlight/upgrade/McL type events),  amp; what's your usual distribution on turn goodness. I came close (2 car length, probably could have closed one of those out had I not missed full perfects on turn 3 SB) twice but not my day today. What's your usual SB strategy (assuming you get perfect or nearly so in launch, you'll have a double boost after turn 1)? The F1 is definitely a bit slidey on turns. It feels like if I boost too soon after a turn the speed differential benefit w/r the other car (whether trailing or leading) is not so good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok thanks , I was thinking blowing one or the other half might be good on shallow turns. So turn 2 bayside I sometimes found I would get blown by from behind despite a double perfect, wasn #8217;t sure if that was them boosting into the turn or something else, maybe it was a similar early gas after... Not sure if it makes any difference but I often wait til mid straightaway out of a perfect launch if I want to do a half burn (boost ends 2sec before turn). Figuring the AI might then have harder time deciding- burn into the turn or let me escape. While practicing DD one time the Charger hellcat AI blasted thru turn 2 to pass me and hit the wall w/o any help from me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not one to super optimize Rivals matchups, often if I get one in the +15-19PI range I often just take it. I've dabbled a few times in the bait and switch (your own car) thing, with mixed results. The 2002 skyline,  amp; focus are pretty scary rocketing off the line, but when I don't lose my cool  amp; execute turns well i'll find myself catching  amp; passing them on the big straights (in Rivals). Todays rivals was street so I tried a run against last week's spotlight (MB 190E Evolution II). The +15pi was easy, so I tried +25, +30, won both handily, but then met my match at +35. I imagine they're all tough at +40 or more, but +30 is about my limit where I can win  gt;half. So who's your favorite duck? (poll limited to 6 else I would put all the street options, the 1st two I haven't heard as being especially slow, but I just picked at random from the many remaining choices).

    <TEXT>Thanks for the suggestion, saved my hide on Bayside vs charger Hellcat that had single boosted to turn one and by the time I had finished turn 1 I was well behind and the double boost barely dented its lead downhill. With the brake/ very early gas I slingshotted by on turn 2, but not used to carrying that much speed into turn 3 only managed good/perfect so had to sweat it out in the tunnel with only 1.5boost. Did a single before the ramp and another on landing to squeak it out. Usually I fail in +25pi matches in upgrade events.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree Bayside was always my least fave track. Lost McL event low tier final (560pi) today there w/ my F1 @529pi Even Boosting off a perfect start to first turn, I got nudged wide on the exit. Half boost to turn 2 didn #8217;t keep me close, too far for even the half brake method to be of much use so I tried for a good turn 2 and another half boost. No dice too far back by the time I finished turn 3. But the half brake (thx NutTote) helps a lot for seeming lost causes at Bayside 2 and SB 3. Try and get a perfect brake but then near immediately back on gas. You #8217;ll lose the half boost charge on exit but close the gap a bunch. You #8217;ll slide wide, but can tailor how much too early you gas while avoiding catastrophic crash based on knowing your car handling.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Intentionally blowing turns</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-02 23:28:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>It started as a way to avoid double nitros in bad spots where you have to use it or lose it (turn 2 DD). There you don #8217;t want to outright miss entirely, but may good or great only on the exit. Then others suggested no lift or half brakes on shallow turns (SB 3, Bay 2) which seems to work well enough if you can sacrifice a half or full boost for position. Wondering now if there are other situations where it makes sense to blow a turn. Bay 1 I didn #8217;t use my perfect launch boost immediately. But was feeling the pressure of the AI car. Sure enough, after my perfect brake, it was squeezing in from left rear. By then i was at 1.9 boosts so said what the hey and immediately early gassed. If I had waited I woulda been pinched to the wall anyway (and usually level w/the AI) but found myself still at the wall, but clear by a length, and felt much better benefit of my double boost. I #8217;ll Another time DD I got stuck w/ a double at turn 2 (missed my not perfect exit and got perfect) so I blasted immediately. I got the inside line on the 3rd corner, 0.9 of a boost after perfect brake, but AI coming fast around outside. Likely no shot at even 2single boosts on that leg, even w/ a perfect gas, So I early gassed, swinging wide,  amp; the AI never got to finish its outside pass. Maybe it had double boosted just to catch up and had no boosts left, but too often I have lost despite leading into turn3, so wonder if the sloppy wide swing can sometimes cut off the AI from an outside pass?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can confirm now the joys of freestyle, rather than trying to nail every turn perfectly, you decide on the fly based on position/speed/opponent. Bayside, midway thru turn 1 w/ a perfect start held boost and perfect brake, you #8217;re at 2 boost. Screw the perfect gas, early gas outta there. Then your double boost will be started clear of and ahead of AI car, not behind. Spotlight 3 taking on a car at +20PI bayside I often lose, but here I was ahead to turn 2 enough to double perfect turn 2, it caught up turn 3, but perf brake left me at 1.9, so I gassed early again to fall behind less, double boosted thru the underpass, and held on post jump. In retrospect maybe shoulda half braked turn 2 to better hold speed and try and nail turn 3, but it worked out ok.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Epics take less sorta, because they #8217;re guaranteed 3* I think? At 3.75* (3rd copy) you #8217;ll get a double down offer to make it 4* (250g for a common, 400g for a rare). Stupid me got that offer on Charger RT spotlight week, thought wait, we have 4 more days, I can clear 1.5 spotlight spin a day, so with 400g I could guarantee another charger. Sure thing BUT 2 STAR it turned out!!! With epics the double down and spin cost are more directly comparable if all copies are 3*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TRY TO ALWAYS FINISH EVENTS WITH 400 CHIPS LEFTOVER. Cards earned in an event are stuck at their Episode odds. So if you #8217;re auto race grinding 1-1-1, 2x300 gets you 1 card + 100chips. 2x200 gets you 400chips, effectively 4/5 of an Ep 3 card. Same for tiers of upgrade events. Eventually you get to the point where you have more upgrade units than CR to install them. Then spam 1-1-2. That episode gets you a card per 300 chips. So autorace top value gives you 3 cards per run there. All? Level3 tuning kits (400unit). And 200-400 CR with that. Most of the time 300CR. Feels like the 200CR comes more often than the 400, but no matter, much closer to balanced tuning unit and CR acquisition there. 300CR/400unit, vs 300CR/3000unit. Yeah it feels like you #8217;re wasting effort for only level3 Kits, but if you #8217;re short on credit, a stockpile of level5 units is also unusable without matching CR. 1-1-2 gets you ~900CR for 7 energy. Don #8217;t think theres anywhere better. 1-1-1 run at 2x200 (to get 400chips) gets you 4/5x300CR =240CR for 3 energy. 1-1-1 at 2x300 = 1card at 200CR, and 1/5 of an Ep3 card (300CR), so 260CR for 3 energy. 520CR for 6 energy is nowhere near 900Cr for 7 energy of spamming 1-1-2. So any time you #8217;re filling up on energy but not having time to commit to an event. You can burn up some energy and get some CR/tuning units in the meantime rather than just leave your energy full. So if I plan a 1hr dinner, I #8217;ll burn off 15 energy with 2 min of auto racing 111 or 112.</TEXT>

Unfortunately they just get used in the order won I think so you can #8217;t selectively redeem cards.

Or if you spam Ep112, all?? the kits are 400unit (and only 300chips needed per card, so autorace level 3 = 3 cards for 7 energy). And the CR they come with are lottery: 200-300-400. Half 300CR, 30% 200CR, 20% 400CR, guesstimating. Averaging  gt;250Cr of the Ep2 cards in any case.</TEXT>

The count of results per column with values  lt;0.05 (odds of getting a level1 kit) varies a bunch between columns. Most near 8 as expected, but out of the 100 columns, refreshing repeatedly ( regenerating the random draws), the number of people getting  gt;15 level 1 cards fluctuates, 0, 1, 2, 3.

    <TEXT>tinytask is pretty small, seems to work well enough. click through things at a leisurely pace, in case the timing is a bit off. Then you can set a number of cycle repeats (to use up your total energy). Don't run it when you're attempting to anything else, because it's essentially grabbing mouse and keyboard control every fractional second so you can superquick move it to click something else but might mess up the autoplay (different window in focus, etc) and just be generally annoying. Someone suggested spamming upgrade 1 shortest path instead of Ep111, but not sure if the event geometry is always fixed like the story events are. Fixed position and full windowing FS lets it be pretty precise on where you are clicking. i guess you could record a new one each day but that would be a pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those short on CR or tuning units (tunits?), spamming low level events is a low energy way of converting energy into CR or tunits. Ep111 is popular because it's short (doable when you have little leftover energy), although lots of dialog bubbles to click through. Generic Upgrade1 has a short-ish path, no dialog, but I'm not sure if its layout is fixed to allow a recorded macro repeat until burned up your energy. Ep112 is especially good for those low on CR (doing lots of upgrades in a short time, which cost  gt; 10000CR at a pop at higher levels). I don't know the true odds for Ep112 CR awards, but guessing half time 300CR, and somewhat more 200 than 400. Below the chart of the expected (long term average) value per unit of energy consumed for different autorace spamming options, based on your current Ep completion level.

    <TEXT>Bars looks like indicating needing 8 4\* dupes. If 5\* car is what's needed to finish Ep4 I'm just gonna quit and do the occasional Rivals or spotlight events to pick up rare/epics and do short boredom breaks during the day. My 904 is 4\* too but I like the Miura more (stuck at like 3.7\*). I'm hoping this spotlight dupes gets me more super classic spins to promote my Miura, although so far I've mainly gotten more 911 copies out of that. It's like the spin generator isn't really random and tilts against what you have upgraded. They obviously know what you have and upgraded, because they often start the spin on such a car, or finish ticking just past or just short of that on the animation. Maybe the spins truly are random and the visuals and tilted odds are just psychological perception, but the animation coding clearly knows what you have, so tilting against it in the spins would not be that hard to write in, you just wouldn't want to make it obvious enough that it couldn't possibly be just bad luck. That's my crackpot conspiracy theory for the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right right there are the psyche games, but would/could they cook the actual odds is my conspiracy theory. Short of getting the source code, or large scale collaborative data collection, very hard to prove cooked odds. Defendants can write it off to small N stats/ random unluckiness. Sort of like that experiment opening 160 cards of challenge chips. 2, 3, 5, 20 people seeing  gt;10% level 1 kits at Ep3 can be written off to random bad luck and biased self reporting (those who do badly more likely to report). But if  gt;50% of the player base reports the same, THEN you have a case. But you have to have actual damages too (IRL $ spent because of the cooked odds). Lawyer fees would outweigh the $ spent in game for most players. And maybe unless you can prove malicious intent, even misadvertised odds is maybe no big deal - there #8217;s probably fine print in the agreement terms when starting the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congrats at least on your purchased McLs. Your free spin luck resembles mine, and a lot of other peoples' based on the poll (all the 0 for 12s inside their first 15 free spins). Great that you had all that gold stashed. I started maybe 2nd week of mobile launch so nowhere near that much gold. Wasted (?) maybe 850g after my first week on spotlight for a guaranteed Boss 302, although it did give me a half decent array to start my garage. Wasted another 400g to get a 2\* ChargerRT on last day of its spotlight leaving me just short of 4. And then another 2100g or so for the 3 epic McLarens (only the P1 among them anywhere near 4\*).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, that's why i called it conspiracy theory. Not easy to disprove, but easy to raise doubt/paranoia. I actually think most people are honest most of the time. Maybe 10% of the people honest 100% of the time. A huge block in the middle, 90% honest? But tempted with enough maybe willing to bend their morals. Don't casinos and such have very rigorous auditing systems from the regulators, you don't need to cook the odds that much to improve the cash flow. Of course casinos do much more volume than a little f2p mobile game so there's more at stake. But the more devious of humans are always weighing benefits of cheating against odds of getting caught.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, DD last turn if your car has double boost already mid last turn, once you are past 3/4 turn early gas outta there. Same deal if after the brake you #8217;re at  lt;1.25 boost, even getting the additional half boost from perfect gas, not enough space to single boost and another near the line, even with a perfect gas. Gas out early to keep position and hope it #8217;s enough. Driving Focus I usually opt for other Focus, modern Skyline, Silvia, as Rivals opponent. MB Evolution II also sluggish. Early gas on DD 3 might also help if opp is passing on outside, because you swing wide, maybe squeeze their pass attempt. Don #8217;t gas before half turn because you #8217;ll hit a wall hard. One of the 111 races is DD so you can practice your freestyle driving there. Set opp to level 4 (matches your PI + 10-20). Bayside 1 similar choice- just missed perfect launch + perf brake = 2boosts ready mid turn. Finishing perfect turn has no benefit. Early gas outta there, but you sorta have to know how early for a given car. Some swing so far out that you lose ground. Most cars past 3/4 turn is safe enough. Bay2 and SB3 you can go pretty extreme though, being shallow turns gassing before mid turn is a hairy mess but you will gain ground on the opp or even pass w/o boosting. Practice in an early story level with your target track, opp set to matched higher PI.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same on my guaranteed 570 2*,3*, 720 2*. My first free card was an F1 which I had already bought gold spin seeing how dismal my free spin odds were. Also bought the P1 early thinking it was like spotlight, car of the week higher odds... nope. I got my first on spin 2 then blew 1400g trying to 4* it... 3.75*, not enough g left to buy the double down offer. My luck  #8220;turning #8221; only got me 2* 570, 720 but at least it #8217;s something. If lucky maybe I can 3* the 720 or 4* the P1 before the event is over... wishful thinking. Even the 3* P1 is amazing. People complain about the twitchy launch but if you can time it so that you mash and hold gas right as the shadow of the two countdown starts to show up you can nail the perfect start. I hit about half of those but even with overgas you are ahead of 90% of cars. The one time to take limited time offers? Double down to get a 3.75* rare car to 4*. Even in spotlight weeks most of the wins are 2* version of spotlight car. So a gold bought spotlight card may leave you short of 4*. Epic weeks though, every spotlight win is a 3*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think maybe a +50 vs an RS200, barely. But another time more recently I was taking on a +50ish one on SB, made it thru turn 3 ahead, double boosted, and it surged late, beat me by a half hood. Since then mostly stick to  lt;40. The extra 100-200 points offset by the losses if you don #8217;t win  gt;90%. A +30pi win is worth about 1000 pts, so you need 9 such big wins and a lot of new opp searching just to squeeze that last bit. For my RS200  amp; Focus RS I #8217;ll send them up against the same car +20ish. You don #8217;t know what track you #8217;ll get. Against pretty much anything else (ok maybe modern skyline too), w/ gt;20pi on SB you #8217;re scrod. Dunno if I  #8220;want #8221; a modern skyline other than completionist OCD. I did pass on the GT40 though with a spin price of 140g! My 700g wouldn #8217;t guarantee a Senna so played it safe, and even after I won the Senna day 3 (knew I would get to 1000g by day 7, but was hoping P1 would be the last week), didn #8217;t get the GT40 based on how meh it is as a Rivals opponent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do you have so many brakes, I don #8217;t bother running that brake event since none of the upgrades have needed that so far. Generic upgrade I don #8217;t bother domination unless I need multiples of one of the parts, same in class upgrade likewise, or to pick up car spin card chips. Spotlight I just tried to dominate the level I could do without trouble (#2 when my cars were low 500s) and then if I had energy get as far as possible on # 3 down the lowest PI path. Then just quit event- you lose your challenge chips BFd but can keep the spotlight chips. Eventually you can win that easiest path, then eventually dominate as you get more high pi cars. McLaren is like having another spotlight event, 2000 chips, one card spin, if you can beat the 550  amp; 570 tier cars and all the class  amp; era cars below (which should be easy as long as you don #8217;t send your top classic/retro/modern cars into their class race by accident ( did that once).

    <TEXT>So what #8217;d your final garage look like? On the racing aspect, I #8217;ve gone the freestyle route just for spice and experimentation. Sometimes it #8217;s detrimental to getting a win but it #8217;s interesting. Especially DD even when outclassed, on the turns you can get close enough to wreak havoc. I had done perfect start and boost just to keep up to turn 1 so I no braked and rode it into the cafe wall. It escaped and pulled away for the win. Same on turn 3 DD, op got through first and even perfect gas wouldn #8217;t be anywhere near double boost so I early gassed since I was on corner inside, and pushed it up the curb and everyone went all akimbo. One time I won, another time lost. Maybe the outcomes would #8217;ve been same w/o playing bumper cars, but it was fun pushing the edge. After story completion and with garage mostly complete, I can see there not being much point tho. I too was a little bored w/ the race mechanics until discovering freestyle over trying to perfect every turn. Started trying out NFS no limits, didn #8217;t really get into it nor understand the constructs for story progress  amp; upgrades . Gritty tone may work for some but not really for me. A9 is lighter (all daytime?) and kinda chaotic based on the preview clips. Is the progress upgrade path equally convoluted as NFS. I guess FS upgrades are pretty convoluted too until you get used to it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely, freestyle for me started with DD 2 where if opp is close the double boost is wasted but hold it and they blast to turn 3 way too far ahead to catch up. Screw the perfect gas, you #8217;re worse off. Then reports of no-lift and Half braking on bay2  amp; SB 3 opened up the floodgates of experimentation for me, as I started to beat +25-30 upgrade/spotlight/etc that I was failing trying to race clean. Used it on McL sometimes too. If it looks like you #8217;re gonna lose anyway give it a shot. On Bay 2 sometimes you love tap em and they stay about even, but other times you ride the inside or outside curb yet pull ahead. My fave time was shoving the opp on the outside line into the curb. Obviously you beat the story already so nothing you really need to do further, but for a bit of entertainment try for what you can get away with, whether it helps or hurts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably where a lot of people who started around the time of mobile launch are currently. Waiting for the wheel of fortune to spin their preferred/ upgraded cars into 4* zone to get above 570ish PI. Switching allegiances bottlenecked by class upgrade frequency. Wasted lots of efforts/upgrades on Camaro 35th until they turned it into a skater on Bayside landings. Probably spent too much gold on P1 to get it to just 3.75*, and effort getting McLs upgraded to win McL events, altho they #8217;re still useful in spotlight 3, class upgrade 2, etc. But a dead end for story til next year given super low McL card drop rates personally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Leaning towards Miura, altho in super classic spins feels like a sea of silver 904s blowing by but we know the animation display and underlying odds may not be correlated. It took longer for Miura to 4*, but when they were both 478pi Miura was nearly always 1 sec faster on SB. 904 might be a shade easier on DD, maybe compensatable by trying to better focus driver error. Trying to get Charger Hellcat to 4* in spotlight, but it #8217;s way behind on upgrades too. More pep/fun to drive than Mustang GT, but class parts are slow to come. My 2008 M3 is sadly still only 2 copies of 2*. Spin gods dealt me lots of 323ti early, but they take the away too by stalling me out at 3.9* like forever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the early layout you couldn #8217;t touch half the board w/o a preexisting McL or a super high pi era car. I got my P1 knowing without any existing McL, collecting chips would be slow. The Existing format is better for entry, you should be able to squeeze out 500 chips a day, so a spin every 3-4 days even if you have cars ~500pi only. After a cold streak to card 21, I finally hit (F1, which I had already gotten w/ gold spins), although on the way my non guaranteed included 2 challenger hellcats. Now at card 36, I have since picked up 2 2* 570s, and 1 2* 720s.  amp; 1 Lamborghini Aventador. So close to posted odds if you only count the recent streak.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah on Bay 2 the outcome of an early gas is a little unpredictable, but if you get the inside line it #8217;s nice revenge for the bump you often get at turn 1 when you #8217;re outside. On turn 2 most of the time you just hop the curb for a pass but a few times I pushed the AI car into the outer curb. Sometimes you glance off their left rear bumper and end up on the outer curb yourself, but I would say 80-90% of the time you gain ground/pass by early gassing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m practicing not following the brake/gas zones religiously. On some cars it helps, others it hurts. Most of the Lamborghini  amp; McL F1 seem to slide a huge amount if you early gas by more than a half nose. Focus Rs the opposite, its double boost is so lame that on SB3 and Bay2 you might be better off doing no brake or a touch amp;go to get a partial boost w/o losing too much speed. I only pretty much use my Focus for rivals and mostly run it vs another focus around +20-30pi so haven #8217;t really worked out a  #8220;best #8221; way to drive it for each track. So I wonder if the AI knows those tricks and what it can swing for each car. I used to wonder on Bay 2 how the AI blew past me (after I did a double perfect) and yet had a double boost ready for turn 3; now I return the favor when I can. Still learning the ropes tho; sometimes I scrape too much curb/wall and lose anyway. But it can be a good desperation move.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s still possible to do stuff like this but the window is tighter. I spun around an AI Charger Rt by double boosting into its rear bumper exiting Bay3. Rode 2 AI cars into the wall at DD3 by early gassing, won once, lost once. DD3 another time from behind  amp; outside I early gassed up the curb and double boosted past AI. Another time went way too early and bounced off wall to a near dead stop. Bay2 early gas I once rode AI car into the curb for an easy pass and win. Another time hit a Centarino square on rear bumper and billiard shotted it into a huge lead while I lost all momentum. So there is fun to be had still. Generally knowing your car vs AI cornering ability helps.</TEXT>

Miura a whole sec faster on SB for me when at the same PI. But it takes the corners slower/ w more sliding in DD. In Bayside prob a draw.

    <TEXT>Interesting, it #8217;s pretty easy to beat in Rivals. The AI driver does various stupid things like boost 5 car lengths from the next turn and such. But in regular usage in story/upgrade/spotlight, is it half decent at taking on +25pi cars? I really love the McL P1. Tho mine is stuck at 3.75* 585pi it feels the equal of my z06 at 610pi (other than not being able to autorace cars in the high 500s). The launch if you can time right is insane. But even a too much gas you #8217;re off the line faster than all but the top 5% of cars in Forza Street.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds a lot like the modern GT, pretty smooth, a bit sedate. When not too much is at stake learn how to drive imperfect tho with various cars. With some cars you lose more waiting for your perfect gas than you would get from the extra half boost. Also practice catching a great or perfect gas after a late brake, it comes handy for missed turns. Some turns (Bay2, SB3) with some cars you can get away with very late brake and/or very early gas w/o crashing. Some cars (focus RS, other street cars) the double boost is so anemic some people do a no lift on those wide turns and hold max speed better. Check your lap times to see whether it helps or hurts much. I find early gassing so much fun, the results are a bit unpredictable, but riding up on the sidewalk for an inside or outside pass, or pushing the opp up into the curb is sadistically satisfying and a lot less boring than monotonically trying to nail perfect everythings #128520;</TEXT>

Opted not, to get a half boost, halfway down the stretch as GT rounds the turn, come on come on, and I don #8217;t know if it was a single or double, but the GT had enough boost to blow by 7/8 down the stretch. There #8217;s no look back button so hard to judge what to do with the lead in a slow car.

    <TEXT>I think step 1 would should be vs ghosts from previous rivals runs, cursory method take the checkpoint times  amp; finish times from prior runs of real players with given car/PI range and squeeze the animation to match. Maybe do some computer model time expansion or shrinkage, eg if no real player ever bothered to level up a 780pi Skyline II, extrapolate the seconds/100pi change on the tracks to give it the x% improvement in lap time expected. Then you don #8217;t have to rely on a pool of players to be online any given moment. Just feed the game checkpoint times and let it simulate locally. Right now  #8220;practice #8221; is Ep112 on dynamic difficulty for me. Rack up challenge cards while trying out car handling  amp; techniques.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like the 2002 turbo too, although it happened to be well ahead of escort in the star sweepstakes from 3* all the way thru 4*. Database times for others not that different, and YMMV based on driving styles/ tendencies. Less than 0.2 sec is nothing in the scheme of things but even if you get ~same times, if you get stressed on runs with a given car, best to level up another. For me in super my Miura runs were averaging a full second faster on SB than the 904, so I had to wait ~2weeks longer for it to 4*. Just when I was getting tired of waiting and pushed the 904 to 530pi to better run the upgrade events, the Miura got its 4*. Always works out that way huh?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Running RS200 vs RS200 +25pi on Bayside Rivals, nose level w rear bumper of AI car, 2/3 of the way thru the tunnel I hit my double boost, burnout finished 1/3 up the ramp.

I finish the jump first, thinking OK I #8217;m good, then the AI car blows by me in the slo mo sequence like I #8217;m standing still, wins by like 3 lengths. So RS200 owners, how do you run on Bayside? Most cars I double boost ASAP (once it #8217;s full) after the tire screeching on turn 3 is done (due to the sketch landings for so many cars).

Final straight, at their rear bumper or slightly ahead, double boost, home fre... what the f? It #8217;s like it has a magic triple boost. The 914/6 the same. Most of the time you can stomp on it, but if you ran a sloppy race and it #8217;s anywhere close at the end, magical finishing speed. I need to look at perf profile, even tho not accurate it gives s sense of how the devs intend that car to run, so a car with bad acceleration or launch but ok top speed can make you pay for sloppy racing at the finish.

In DD2 the other day I was waiting for my perfect gas and the AI GTR got all up my rear taking me near 45deg sideways. Someone advised never boost before Bay1 save it for a double but I get taken wide there so often by waiting, not sure on that. On a perfect start  amp; brake you can jet outta there early, but even on a good start maybe that makes sense. You #8217;ll be 1/3 downhill before your double boost is ready, but knocked wide same issue, still sliding for that long, or wasting part of your boost if you hit it before sliding is done</TEXT>

But then my McL 570s hit 4* with help of a double down offer, and the Z06 became spotlight car so I got that to 4* too. I personally chose the 570s over the 370z since it felt like it had better acceleration although I didn #8217;t do any systematic testing of lap times.

    <TEXT>Agree, sometimes just gotta go with what the card spin lottery gets you to 4* first. Skyline II  amp; focus both great launches but weak on straight speed. You need one modern  amp; one classic at pretty high PI in each class to advance in story, and one or 2 retros for generic upgrade path and spotlight events. Some class upgrades events also need a high retro in the uptake and brake events, but worry about that once you #8217;re in the mid 500s. Of what you show, Boss 302  amp; Charger Hellcat decent for muscle. Some like charger RT for classic Z06  amp; stingray good sports. Z06 may get stuck at 3* max of 585 until it comes back in spotlight, but good to have a high PI epic like that until you get a 4* common or rare to surpass it. Street 2008 M3 is good modern if you have it at 3*+, for classics, 2002 turbo, skyline, escort popular with different people. Capri has rough launch but good speed. Super your GTR not bad. For classic I like Miura but many prefer 904. Aside from lottery luck, a lot is personal taste- you want more top speed, or easier perfect turns. So practice on early story events with opponent difficulty set at +20-30pi over your cars and see what you like running with, and hate running against, and that gives hints on what cars you might want to upgrade</TEXT>

If you can perfect start, perfect brake, then one wheel length before yellow zone, early gas it. On the early gas of Bayside 2, you have to be conservative, gassing before half thru red zone you're into the outside curb pretty hard and losing speed, only do super early if you're on the turn inside and behind opp , you'll sideswipe opp, so although you lose speed they definitely do too. DD F1 is not great either since that's nearly all turns. If I manage a perfect start and perfect brake, I'll try for the perfect gas but biasing toward the early side turn 1. If you miss, no big deal, already full on boost. You're usually on left side after turn 2, then see where opp is relative. If way behind I'll single boost to get inside track turn 3. If close-ish I wait cross my fingers and hope they start to do a right side pass. If so after a perfect brake you'll be around 1.75boost or higher and if on the inside track of the turn you can play it by ear. If before end of red zone opp has gotten ahead, try and early gas once their rear wheel/bumper is level w/ your nose, and you'll shove them up the curb. Same tactic if you burned the single boost but they still managed an outside pass using a double. If after your brake you're near/over 1boost but below 1.3 then try and optimize for the shove rather than the boost. The only exception might be against Focus, RS200, or SkylineII with super weak double boosts. Otherwise, by the time you've finished the perfecting the gas they're 1/3 of the way down the stretch and even a double boost won't catch you up. Stingray 427 is similar to F1, decent speed but wait forever to perfect gas, and kinda wide sliding on turns. Yesterday on DD3 I had the inside corner, 0.9 boost after the brake, and opp was half length ahead (my nose just behind driver door) entering gas zone while I was still in red, waiting. Opted to gas then, shoved it up the curb, and we were running even for a fraction of a second, saw my boost was at 1.1, so took it right then. They ran out of curb and had to tuck in behind me, and I held on. A different time I waited too long, and they jumped off the curb in front of me. Hard to know what opp boost level was so that could have been the difference, but if they're up the curb, grab the lead while you can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah a bit surprised on the choice of Focus. In Rivals it seems super slow, no lead is safe. Does it act more nicely in story/upgrade/spotlight? Do you try for race tactics other than double perfects (when I run it in rivals it seems pretty robust to super early gassing- no half boost but you're exiting turns way early)? Still even with that I usually lose with Focus in Rivals, even vs +20PI (aside from another Focus). AI does seem to cut some slack. Maybe it's selective memory, but the times I too much gas the start feels like proportionally more often the AI does the same (at least more than usual).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-25 23:45:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Classic Escort 470pi vs Skyline II 505pi on South Beach, I'd run a pretty poor race to that point, with the Nissan boosting \~3 seconds before turn 3 for the lead. So I do the perfect brake very early gas thing, passing it by 2 lengths just outside turn 3, then double boost down the stretch. I think OK whew that was close, and then closing on the finish, slo-mo kicks in and the Skyline is boosting past, finishing 1 length ahead. 1. Classic Escort is not in my regular usage rotation, so is it just slow on straights? 2. Or have they boosted the performance of some Epics like the Skyline that were previously over-crippled? 3. Or is it just the inevitable outcome of a poorly run race up to that point (happened to me prior vs a Focus on SB) Part of me is guessing 3. If you run well enough in the front of the race, you're not anywhere close enough to notice the closing speeds of the Focus/Skyline/other seemingly slow cars, e.g. with poor acceleration but middling to good top speed. But if you are still in contact at the end, watch out. But others noticing overperforming previously really horrid epics makes me think 2 is not out of the question as well.</TEXT>

Thankfully the worst I #8217;ve seen is a win on spin 8 (6 card misses on last days of the viper spotlight). Had to add 2 gold spins to get copy 5 and 4* it. Running the viper at 470pi in Rivals tho, seems really slow on the straights, I lost with it. So I tried taking on a +25pi viper, and lost to it. Not sure if I should level it up, doubt it can top my Z06 or 570s even if brought up to 600pi, neither of those ever felt sluggish at low PI.</TEXT>

RS200 rockets off, always pulling away. Hmm ok did they beef it up a lot? Shake it off, get a matchup vs 630pi Evo II, 30-05 = 25, my Countach should handle that right? With perf launch still in touch to turn 1 on SB but then ever widening gap and the Evo becomes a tiny dot. Uh yeah 630 minus FIVE-05 is 125pi difference, not 25. 129pi on the prior... DOH! So discombobulated that I lost the next match F1 at 585pi vs another Rs200 at 622pi on DD. DD is probably the worst place for that matchup but still usually totally winnable.

    <TEXT>Crank through story. That #8217;s how I tried to scrape together gold as the McL event was wrapping. 10g per event finished, 20g to dominate. 20g per part finished, 50g dominated. The every 4 hr free currency awards sometimes give gold. Supposed to be 10%. If you time exactly, skip 1 per day (one right before bed, sleep 8 hrs. 1 right when you get up) maybe 1 win per 2 days. Not fast but it #8217;s something. Hitting up the upgrade events and doing the daily challenge tho are probably the most energy efficient way to get free spins. save your gold for double down offers on rare or common cars (offered when you hit 3.75*, take it and you #8217;re instantly 4*). Maybe on an epic too if not in a spotlight car. If spotlight. For 700g you can buy 7 spotlight spins and every epic win is 3* copy. Rare and common spotlight wins are often 2*, so 400g for a guaranteed 3* copy of a rare is better than buying 5 spins at 85g each</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would crank that Charger hellcat and RT up to 600ish pi since they #8217;re at 4* already. Easy autorace workhorses for non-restricted races. Miura get that up to 600ish too. If you #8217;ve got any non upgraded common or rare modern super cars approaching or at 4* see how you like running them vs +20pi opponents, as compared to Ford GT. I spam Ep112 for challenge cards (good as a test track)- if set to floating max difficulty 4 (when your car is  gt;20pi above difficulty 3) it auto sets to your cars pi+10-20. 3 races = 5 challenge cards, all of them level 3 tuning kits, and ~300CR on average. Modern sports your 720s more likely to 4* before your Z06. If you have a 570s at 3.5* or higher, that might hit 4* even sooner. I think all of those drive decent. Classic sports 300SL not bad except horrible slider on Bayside end. Street modern I like C32 over Focus. I never upgraded Focus over 500, it feels lacking in speed for Bayside or SB. 2008 M3 better than either of them. Street classic escort is OK. I would take at least one retro to high 500pi, for spotlight and upgrade events. Unless you really like how Silvia K drives, 1991 M3 I think is better, and will soon be 4* too. Like the Focus, RS200 nearly no lead feels safe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, in case I wasn #8217;t clear, don #8217;t take the double down on Epic cars during its spotlight or special event where you can buy a spin for 100g. 7 spins in an epic spotlight event gets you shots at other cars, and your epic win is always 3*, well over 70%cumulative odds by spin 7. Outside its event though, could be a while before you see it again. Rare or common cars however, although bought spotlight spins guarantee the car within 10, more than half the time they are 2* and you may spend the same or more gold (250g or 400g for common or rare respectively) and still be short of 4*. But don #8217;t take every double down (including epics), only the cars you really like and want to promote to really high PI. Sometimes you later regret a choice, that #8217;s Ok. But if you #8217;re not changing your mind every week you have enough time to build back enough for the next double down or spotlight where you need some gold. Personally I never take the double down making the 3.25* into 3.5 only the 3.75* to 4. You may still wait forever at 3.5* for that next copy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I NEVER spend gold on energy packs. Just decide on your priorities. Like most people class upgrade usually top priority unless its a car I REALLY want in spotlight. You can get lots of car spins from class upgrade = tuning kits  amp; CR  amp; more spin chips for any dupes you get, or missing cars to fill your garage. In terms of NRG burned per car spin, usually better than spotlight. I'm never quite sure if dominating a class upgrade event is worth it, nearly triple the energy for a 2nd part, and and the 3rd run through there's not much left to pick up in spin chips or tuning kits. If you're in a hurry to get certain class parts though I guess what other choice is there, wait another half week? If I've got cars waiting for generic parts to supplement class parts for upgrade I'll usually run that before spotlight. Dominating if I need triples or more (typical for intakes and brakes at higher upgrade levels- but early on you mostly need tons of exhausts for various cars). Otherwise I'll pick a single run thru path that gets the biggest combo of CR, wrenches,  amp; upgrade chips, or the shortest one that will get me the part I want for minimal energy. Spotlight I'll run or do last depending on if it's not a car I like/want. Spotlight dominating an event gives you triple more victory chips, so for example if you can dominate event 3 you get way more points than you would from single runs through spotlight event 2 and 1. Likewise dominating 2 better than single runs through 1 2 3 I think, although I haven't tallied exactly. Always do the daily challenge. Essentially a free premium card for minimal additional effort. Sometimes it's the same class as upgrade event for the day. Even if not, I just spam Ep112 with the car class in question (or if win with a car in each class, use the 3 classes not in the upgrade event of the day), or do it in generic upgrade. You can also work in your +10pi or perfect brake quotas that way too if you haven't met it in the upgrade or other events.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Autorace depends. I'll manually race if I have to but to get around to other life stuff I often autorace. But yeah if I have to burn up a real world minute for a race (or out of boredom) I'll set it to difficulty 4 for more challenge packs. Last race of a long event string if I'll have to burn wrenches to rerun I'll just set it to autorace. If I blow an early race in a long string I just quit and restart event. After a while you get a sense of which PI gaps you can handle vs which cars even allowing for less than your average performance, and plan accordingly. Yeah this spotlight boost has much better payoff than usual, and super  amp; generic parts too, so all rolled in one, so after class upgrade (if a class you want/need) spotlight gets top billing. Still, no generic brakes in this event and that is my major logjam now, a few \~600ish cars between upgrade 9/10/11, so I'm not bothering with spotlight 1 and doing generic upgrade 3 instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ran into one in rivals (tired of waiting for the  #8220;right #8221; Focus or Skyline II to pop up, kept getting +15-20 and +50 versions to run against) running +25pi vs my Retro M3 619pi. DD only got a good launch, and I only half perfected turn 1. Single boost didn #8217;t get me very clear, pushed around the corner again, and my double boost didn #8217;t clear me by enough (maybe still sliding from the corner push?) because as I was waiting for my perfect gas on DD3 it was outside passing me. I was so close to the gas zone I opted to wait, maybe a mistake because after the perfect gas I was at 1.3 boost. Double boost would be too late to be of use, so I single, start gaining, but it single boosts halfway down stretch. My second single ready 3/4 of the way but I #8217;m 2 lengths back at that point, so i only close to its rear bumper by the finish. I suspected the Bel Air not that weak of a car but retro M3 usually my old reliable, and +25 not that big a gap. 2 more perfects (half a boost extra or earlier)and maybe a different outcome, but I #8217;m used to getting away with a bit of slop. Using it in rivals I ran it vs a +35 Focus (with my better street cars I usually try +40-45) and it was easier than I expected so maybe I #8217;ve been misjudging it. Bel Air is still only 3.5* so it #8217;s not going to be in my regular rotation, but I #8217;m giving some more respect now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personal stats are always small counts of examples so it #8217;s hard to say. Unless you have hundreds of players entering their stats it #8217;s hard to know for sure. Like on the McLaren event way more people declaring 0 or 1 for 12 McL on the non guaranteed McL cards (the supposed 20% = 2 or 3 of 12) within their first 15, than the opposite, 4+. Some of it is reporter bias, unhappy people are more vocal. But even a few dozen responding to the poll may be a random skewed sub sample. I was among the unlucky. 0 of 17. 1 at #18. Then in my next 16 I got 4 (25%, a bit better than listed odds). On the last day of event, I gambled with only 900g needing 3 wins to get a 3.25* senna up to 4* (an epic double down needs 700g so I would have to win on Both my 1st  amp; 2nd spins to use that). In the end I got 3 copies in 7 spins, way better than listed odds. This week on the Charger SRT spotlight, felt pretty unlucky, wins on spin 5, 2, 5, 6, 9, 4, overall 6 of 31. SRT Already hit 4* so not needing to dominate every event daily. But zero epics among the spins. A few 3* common and rare on other cars (and one of the SRT a 3*). So the wins and misses come very unevenly.</TEXT>

The bump in maxed out PI at 3* is useful to progress, but then hinders as you wait forever for dupes. Spotlights help but you can #8217;t count on your fave car showing up for weeks, months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish I was quicker on the draw at screenshot capture, or that FS had a replay option (whole race, or at least last turn to finish). DD there #8217;s this little dip right before the finish line. So I have a race pretty much in the bag, driving Senna, and release pedal dunno maybe half second before the line, apparently braking right into the dip, scrape, go 30deg sideways, clip the arch post over the finish line. It ended up as a photo finish win but I was too shocked and amused to get a screenshot in time. A lot of FS is same old same old every race, but I kinda like driving sloppy/on the edge, for the occasional surprise discovery. I #8217;m guessing this wouldn #8217;t happen in any street or muscle car with good ground clearance. Most sports aren #8217;t that low either, right? So maybe only supers, like P1  amp; Senna especially low. Maybe GT?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just for yucks I set up an Excel table (prob could be done in google sheets too) with random numbers generated (0-1) in groups of 50 as rows, if you count up sets with 3 or less hits above 0.9 (=10% odds, or you could count up  lt;0.1, same odds) there are quite many. Haven #8217;t worked out how many modern street cards you can rack up per week even if you dominate (or at least get thru next to last race) all the street upgrade events, maybe 5-6? So 20 weeks to get ~100 spins, even odds to score one Skyline II. So totally have come to grips with likelihood of never seeing some of the epics unless or until they spotlight. Even though there are some odds of other epics in spotlight or premium cards, it #8217;s so diluted by other class epics that once you have a few, you #8217;re more likely to get a dupe of an epic you already have vs get a new one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I #8217;ve found out now the repeated slow launch thing does happen on iOS too, just that you can #8217;t reliably come back to it. PC is truly multitasking so a session never closes on its own, whereas on IOS if I go away and do too many other screens, even if I never killed/ terminated the FS session it reopens on the launch screen with the loading bar and everything is reset. So you just have to do it all in one go, no switching to email or phone call or whatever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Easiest on DD because the turns are tight, and the separation not impossible to close on turns. Any time you get an inside corner you have a shot of late braking or early gassing the AI into a wall/curb/post. On good turning cars only a super early gas will send you wide enough to push out the AI car. I think multiple times I #8217;ve overcommitted to a ramming and the computer read it and dodged by braking hard, kinda like they do in ice hockey to avoid a hard check into the boards. Sometimes on a slow turning car you end up on the receiving end tho. Trying to squeeze out the last 25pts of a perfect gas you #8217;ll get taken out wide by the AI car muscling in as they boost into the turn. So sometimes if the last look back seems kinda tight, I #8217;ll gas a shade early just to get outta the turn before trouble comes barreling in. In Rivals, 25pts missed vs 600+ for losing the race. In story/upgrade/spotlight just get the heck outta there unless the perfect will get you nearly the full boost, or you #8217;re doing it just for practice- same challenge points regardless.</TEXT>

My focus is no longer starting PI ( enough dupes to 4*, plus got it to 460 to Rivals bait opponents for a cluster of 431pi cars. I know for sure it can no lift Bayside 2, whether it can with a single or double boost burning right up to the start of the brake zone another question. Likewise no braking or micro braking turn 1 amp;3, or DD, maybe a Focus/skyline2 strategy for that is brake/ super early gas every turn there with boost mid straight each leg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another thought is how well the opposite would work, super late brake and try for perfect gas. For most cars and turns when I barely miss brake late I can swing a perfect gas about 1/3 of the time (close to half on SB 1  amp; 3). But I imagine Focus/Skyline2 could push it to or past the turn apex to very late brake and not totally slide out. On good turning cars I #8217;ve found my attempts to bump out the AI car at DD 3 have sometimes failed due to turning too well inside of them to hit despite early gassing. Trick on those may be to gas even earlier, or super late brake to ensure swinging wide enough to hit. I guess even on races well in hand you can practice, early gas to the point you not quite or barely hit the curb on exit, and if next time there #8217;s a car there, they #8217;ll be doing a bit of curb hopping ;)</TEXT>

I tried both at 45% thru the turn, just before the apex, and ended up flirting with the wall and losing ground. I also had a centenario at 452pi and a Evolution II at 449, and tho the specs bar chart had the centenario at like 6 bars+ on handling and the Focus  amp; Evo II @ 4 bars, the actual case was the opposite, all but the slightest early gassing and you #8217;re sliding out everywhere in the Cento. Kinda like a diablo but worse. Focus and Evo II handle a half hood early gas with little drama. Super Early gassing may still pay off in a focus given how anemic it #8217;s single and double boosts are, but I #8217;ll have to try at maybe 75% thru the turn.</TEXT>

Retro M3 prior run this * #165;%^ing Cuda got in the way of my double boost outta DD2, I hung up on its left rear bumper, lifted  amp; pushed it 2/3 of the way down leg 2, dropped it back down right before turn DD3, at which point it was ahead and proceeded to win. So next run I was hot for payback, missed in front trying to crunch it coming out of turn 2, and i was back a half length into DD3 so I super early gassed half thru the turn, and it braked/ didn #8217;t gas, and I missed in front again and hit and bounced off the wall. It was at near a dead stop after dodging my crunch. So I had a single boost in the tank, reaccelerated using it, and stayed ahead enough for the win!

    <TEXT>I would say don #8217;t worry about rare or epic, once you get something to 4* it almost doesn #8217;t matter. If you #8217;re leaving spin card chips on the board in upgrade events because you can #8217;t get past the car blocking that path, you #8217;re dragging out the time to get the spins for the cars you want. If it #8217;s just the last car you can #8217;t beat just take the spin chips and quit. Half the supers are rares it seems. GTR  amp; Huracan my faves among the non epic moderns, if I didn #8217;t have either Senna or P1 at 4*, I #8217;d upgrade one of those. I opted for the Diablo over 911 for retro but unsure if that was the right choice- better speed, but slow turns  amp; super unforgiving on missed turn timing. Fall behind and you can #8217;t early gas your way out of trouble. Miura over 904 for classic. A bit more forgiving than Diablo on early gassing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did you not have any stashed gold for the McL event? 1700g more would have guaranteed your senna to 4*? Trick in the P1 is to mash and hold at the right time to launch. For me it #8217;s the instant the 2 countdown shows. Before it grows. The needle bounce just goes below the green, I think I #8217;ve hit that once. The rest of the time I #8217;ve missed late (needle heading towards green) or jumping the gun (heading out of the green zone). That happened a lot in my experiments hyper focusing on the area where numbers show; the box shade changes and maybe there #8217;s a ghost 2 showing. I #8217;m not sure if those times I miss early I trigger on that or just jumped the gun with countdown timing in my head. Other cars I #8217;ve started a strategy of mash and hold and do the countdown like a conductor 3 and 2 and 1 AND (releasing with the AND). I miss 1/4 as goods, 1/4 too much gas, but the half perfects good enough for me, except for really big margin Rivals races with slow rise super tame launchers like focus and 2008 M3, Huracan, etc. where you can work out a tap frequency that hovers 80-100% of the time in green zone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Early gassing or and late braking you can do it, the timing is tough but in desperation moves you can try it. Practice on ep112 to see how early you can get away with, and even if the opponent is not in the right spot you can imagine where an opp car would get squished or pushed in a tight race. If you are getting outside passed on turn bay3 or DD3 and the extra perfect gas won #8217;t get you to or close to a full double or single boost, if you have a slider/wide turner (Charger RT, F1, Capri, many classic muscles) especially, wait til the outside passer is just ahead level with their door or rear bumper, and early gas into their side, this will slow their acceleration past you, maybe send them into the wall/curb and scrub their speed more than yours. If you have a good turner and on the turn outside, with a perfect or slightly early turn, you can clip their nose as they #8217;re trying to finish their wide/slidey turn, cause them to slide/waggle and lose speed. If a slider gets the inside track ahead of you, as they slide wide, and you corner a tighter line, sometimes you can boost into their tail and cause a spin out. Bay1 if you managed perfect launch and brake, sometimes gassing out a wheel width early gets you almost the same turn line, you #8217;re nearly full double boost already, so can dodge trouble trying to push you from behind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congrats maybe? I don't have one yet, but guessing like a Focus, requires a different/special driving style. Based on Superscherge on Bay2 apparently you can boost right up to and through turn 2 with a no lift. You can probably do a microlift (pickup just in time for the perfect brake and no hesitation right back on the gas) to pick up a half boost tank with minimal speed loss. If you perfect launched  amp; braked Bay1 you can probably jet out super early without scrubbing the wall too. I would suggest on DD attempting to see how close to a microlift you can do on the turns without sliding out. On a Focus you need to get just past turn midpoint to avoid crashing into walls, but maybe a Skyline2 is even more special on that. The early turn exits might be able to make up for the lack of speed, especially on DD. South Beach I think you're toast regardless of any tactics, but maybe some experimentation time trials can determine what is the best time you can manage (e.g. SB1 w/ perfect launch  amp; brake, gas out super early, maybe SB2 you can very early gas out too, might be worth more than the half boost from perfect gas), and then plan accordingly for Rivals or whatever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On my iPhone Xr, launch zones register perfect. iPad mini4 it's a guess o matic just like you experience. On twitchy launchers I just mash the pedal and attempt to time the countdown, if I do 3 and 2 and 1 AND (releasing on the and) most of the time it'll land on the good or perfect. Work out your own timing. On the jumpy throttle cars sometimes if you release early it blows through into the slow zone, so be ready to backstop with a light tap before it flies out of the good zone. Perfect  gt; good launch  gt; too much gas  gt; slow launch. If you normally start a given car with rapid taps to hover the needle, just shade it on the low side of the green. The stats bars are meaningless. I find SB most useful for gauging true speed. After your boost out of turn 2, it usually gives you a quick look back if you're way ahead, or you can see where the opp car is if you're behind or close, you can tell if your gap or lead is widening or shrinking in flat straight runs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was replying to that exactly. The needle and the color zones are laggy on some devices, but what it says on the text (and how your boost circle looks after) is what really happened. Rapidly rising needle with a lag, shows dead in the perfect zone but says over gas. Rapidly falling, shows dead perfect, but says good. Falling needle showing red might be perfect. Rising needle showing yellow/good might be perfect. So depends on how fast the needle was moving and which way, shades what it shows vs what actually happened on laggy devices. Unless you're OK with too much gas, usually better to shade on the conservative side. Bounce the needle half into the green zone. The higher you push it, the higher odds it's actually in the red. It's not quite a craps shoot, it's very systematic in the tendencies, but difficult to control for on the twitchy launchers since the needle moves so fast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BTW, same deal on the brake and gas zones, on the iPad mini I feel I have to brake and gas ever so slightly sooner than I do on the Xr. 1 or 2 line stripes / 0.05 second ahead, because if I go exactly by the visual I'm into the next zone (too late). E.g. if I hit gas when my tire is touching both the red and yellow zone, I get perfect. If I hit brake when my tire is between the stand up perfect marker and the red zone, I get late brake even when the tire is still on yellow. Another interesting glitch is DD2, sometimes the brake zone is compressed, and pretty much all you see is the stand up marker with all the stripes piled under it. That stand up marker is still correctly indicating the perfect brake point, just pretend all the other yellow stripes are there, it will still give you a good/great brake as usual.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BTW in case you didn't already realize or tried using it, shallow turns like Bay2 and SB3 are brake optional in some cars, some you can microbrake (barely lift before gassing again), or half brake for other cars, if you need the half boost. I find trying to nail the perfect brake and adjusting the gassing time works best for me (vs late braking and perfect gassed exit) If you are somewhat to a lot behind in these races, you can pick up a lot of ground as the AI usually tries to do a half decent brake/gas regardless of the turn. BUT, you will be exiting with a huge speed differential so on sloppy turners, 1. you may be riding outer curbs or hitting walls or posts and lose some or much of that speed 2. you ride the inside curb passing if you car is a better turner than the AI, maybe losing some speed, but often still passing them 3. you hit them square on the bumper on the exit and lose all your speed, like a billiards shot. This happens a lot if both cars are equal turners. The later you early gas the more control your car has on the exit (the less likely a square on bumper hit), but of course the less your speed advantage. So what you do depends on your car, how far ahead the AI is, what car they have, etc. You can also do this even if you are ahead, to make sure they don't catch up. In Rivals, locking down the win is more important than the +25pts of another perfect brake. I need to learn this better, as I've been burned multiple times trying to squeeze few more points on a perfect gas. GT40, Countach, other "slow" cars have decent final speed, so if you try (and especially miss early) that perfect gas, you've lost both the speed AND the half boost. If you got pushed out from behind on Bay1, if the opp car got ahead, return the favor at Bay2. Imagine a straight line from where your car is pointing, and that is where you will be going for the first 1/4-1/2 second out of an early gas. You might clip their nose or push them sideways into the curb, scrubbing their speed, and be ahead after you break contact. Freestyle driving as I call it makes the game a lot less boring. Doesn't guarantee more consistent wins, but as you get better at it gets you out of jams and lets your recover from mistakes, while introducing opportunities for other mistakes. And for some outlier cars as superscherge puts it, introduces possibilities for atypical strategies. Whenever I run my Focus in Rivals now, I push the edges of early gas wherever I can, and anywhere past the turn midpoint it sticks those turns, way more time than you would gain from the half boost of a perfect gas (boost is super pathetic on a focus). I used to run Focus against only +20pi in Rivals, but now I dare to try the mid +30 range not just against other Focus. Sometimes I'm surprised by the winning margin, but I still don't dare vs +40pi. Those final straightaways in a Focus feel like forever, waiting/dreading for the opponent to blow by.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dang those are fast times. I wonder if lap times vary by platform. I have a Z06 up at 648pi running bayside PPPO (the last OK I was testing jetting out early turn 3) .. 9.897, 21.03, 28.696, 42.926... double boost about 1.5 sec out of turn 1, double boost around where the b/w guard rail stops after turn 3. Someone videoed a straight perfect run on a Turbo 2002 (running on PC) \~570pi and they got a 43.3s Bayside time and on iOS with mine near 600pi I could barely get the low 44s range with straight perfects. I've since pushed it to 640pi should test again, but I don't think I ever go sub 43s, even being \~70pi higher.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have a crystal ball and can predict which epics are coming up in spotlight in a reasonable time frame upgrade that :) On a more serious note, short of a known spotlight coming up, 4\*ing an epic is a superslow time frame, fraught with random luck or lack thereof. One maxed out epic early is good just to blast through generic upgrade events, non-restriction story races, and lead the pack in class upgrade events (with 3 races the easiest class brake or intake upgrade path is half done- you just need one more high PI car in the class to finish and get the part. Try and go with one classic and one modern each class to lead their respective packs and finish at least one path in class upgrade events. One high retro (any class) to dominate the generic upgrade events, gets you those parts up to 3x faster (3 per day not just 1). Then fill in other class retros (except muscle) to dominate their class events. Of the cars you have, take your chargerRT as high as you can, it's a keeper if you can 3\* and then 4\* it. Your ZL1 may get stuck at 585pi so if spotlight events come up with Charger Hellcat jump on that and try and get it as close to 4\* as you can while the event runs. Mustang GT and CTSV are serviceable muscle commons if you get tired of waiting to 4\* a rare. Likewise Cuda Hemi is an OK common classic muscle. Personally on the modern supers I like the GTR over the Porsche. The Huracan is not bad and the spotlight car this week, so try and hammer on the spotlight event to see if you can get one to 3\* or higher. Spotlight 3 there are always some spotlight chips on the first dot so run that and quit immediately once you got your chips, even if you can't beat any of the cars in the event. If the first car in an event is up to 40pi higher than your cars, take a crack at it anyway. 2 cars (or 3 if you hit collector level 15) = 6 or 9 tries to get 1 win in spotlight, and you can collect the stuff immediately behind it. If you get through with tries left over move on to the next race after collecting your stuff. Same for class upgrade events, the class spin chips are worthwhile even if you can't finish a given path. Sports if your 720 gets stuck at 2\* too long, if the Cayman hits 3\* it's a good common. The 570s is OK too. Sports classic yes the stingray 427 is good. Street modern yes m3, get it as high as you can on spotlight. Classic the escort is OK. Turbo 2002. Skyline. Somebody tested all 3 and got times within about 0.2sec on all for a track (maybe South Beach?) so not a lot of separation. To collect tuning kits, spam on Ep1-1-2. If you win all 3 at max difficulty that's 5 challenge cards, all at 400 tuning units each (guaranteed), and \~300CR to use them. As you get to higher upgrade levels you will run out of CR (and even here you're running a 100 deficit).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would go with the results database on one of the tabs on that google doc. Not opinions, run times on tracks. You can enter your own race results there, and there are a few track/car combos that have zero entries. Filter on a given track, filter by time (e.g.  lt;52.5 sec on SB), you can see cars that run atypically fast for their PI. Some of it is just being in the hands of a good driver, but you can mentally compensate, an extra perfect is maybe 0.2 sec?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes the last 0.25\* on a rare car takes forever to get. If they were equal I would say 720 but the Viper is already 4\*. So you can level it up way higher for the time you're still waiting for your 720 to hit 4\*. If you've got too many cars needing parts and tune kits or CR to level up competing for resources then you can sit tight until you sort out those other cars where the preferences are less ambiguous. But it could be a day, a week, a month (or more?) before that last 3\* copy or 3 2\* copies of a 720 drop for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally agree on that, pick to suit your driving style/tendencies. Go to Ep1-1-2, if you run the bottom route you get one race each track. Set to max/floating difficulty (4) and the opp will auto adjust to your PI +some fixed number (I think 494 should be enough over the difficulty 3 opponent PI, need to be at least +20pi to see max difficulty choice). The opponents may change as you run through one car vs when you take the other through, but you'll get a sense of which tracks are more troublesome. Huracan not so good on DD because it takes forever to finish/perfect turns, but also doesn't deal with early gas too well. 911 suffers a bit on SB, feel its top speed not great.. Bayside is kind of in between, so maybe you pick the car that does better on 2 of 3 tracks for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Time only shows 3 decimals tho, right? I know retro 911 is on the slow side in top speed, but Countach is a slow accelerator. Pushing it with +40pi, on Bayside3 nearly full up with double boost, opt to early gas out. Boost mid tunnel, then waiting forever for the slo mo sequence - Countach lands, rips through the final flat, and.... YOU WIN! Of course, karma #8217;s a booger, I managed to blow a race in my P1 vs a classic 911. Blew the start with too much gas. Bay2 I sent it into the curb with a super early gas, but near double boost full I should have late braked or even earlier gassed turn 3 more than I did since it caught up thru the turn. Classic 911 has OK final speed, a bit faster than P1. Boosted about the same time but it was a bit ahead at that point... ah well you win some you lose some  #128557;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Missing in front is often Ok too. Sometimes the AI in trying to dodge the hit will slow enough that despite a bounce off a wall you #8217;re ahead, and with a single boost in hand you can reaccelerate for a win. Done that at DD3 too. Timing I usually shoot for is sometime when my nose is near their rear wheel. You #8217;ll regain speed on the early gas and they #8217;re mid braking, so you #8217;ll end up level or a bit ahead while applying the crunch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two possible strategies. 1. Your Huracan is already at 4\*, you can just crank up the PI until you can autorace everything in sight. In the meantime it helps you clear at least part of the Super Brake Upgrade event = more spins = more chances at a Modern Super you really like. 1. In the meantime if you race it occasionally, you may get better and understand that car's tendencies. 2. You find a Super Modern that you like how it drives more, max that out at 575, and drive it so well that it punches above weight. You can probably take out 595-605pi cars with good runs, but of course you mess up a race it may take wrenches or rerunning the whole event (whereas if you had a Huracan at 615-625 you're guaranteed auto-race wins in those races). Take all candidate cars to the max of their generic exhaust PI, or maybe right up to the point where they're waiting for a 2 Super exhaust upgrade. Then you can get a sense of how they perform at higher PI. I sent my recently 4\* Huracan (got it up because of the spotlight, usually I run P1 or Senna for modern super, long shot of getting those now that McL event is over, and even then they max out at 585 for 3\*) up against a P1 about 10pi lower and lost 2 races in a row to it. But the P1 is especially good- other races I tested Huracan on (vs Superveloce, Retro M1, Diablo) it held it's own against slightly higher PI, but I couldn't swing +20pi yet. Because the throttle is so gentle, you should be able to over the needle in the green zone for a perfect launch like 90% of the time. At least on iOS, super light rapid touches, you can inch up or inch down or hover the position based on the rate of touches. I use pointer finger, since it moves faster than thumb, and you have the 0.3 second where it shows perfect or good launch to switch to thumb throttle for the race if that's how you like to run. Most all the Lambos seem to have a slow hanging turn, I haven't quite worked out the best option for optimizing that beyond attempting straight perfects, but their acceleration speed may make up for a lack of boost on an early gas out of a turn. I've found also they don't seem to like to turn much on gassing out of corners, so you can't go too early, else you're heading into a curb or wall. Another thing to try is the intentional late brake. Since it hangs forever waiting to finish the perfect turn, maybe the Lambos brake super well (overbraking normally?), and running late brake on the first half of the turn will shorten net time of waiting. You give up half a boost doing that, but Lambos with their decent speed and acceleration may make up for that. Maybe to wean your way into that, work your way towards braking as late as possible in the perfect zone, and see if your misses (late brakes) affect your average track time much. If that works, try later and later braking to see what you can get away with. Most cars very late brake you're barely holding on, totally pointing the wrong way when the perfect gas zone comes up, and you blast through the gas zone so fast it's hard to manage a great or perfect gas. You might stand a chance with the Lambo's super slow turn end to nail the gas timing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s what the boost meter is showing. Full up I call 2, 1 is just the inner circle. The decimal is approximately what portion of the circles are filled. Each perfect gas or brake will get you a half circle worth of boost. Running down a leg of a track you #8217;ll pick up another half boost. So as you are entering or exiting a turn you can work out whether in a best case scenario you have any possibility of completing a single or double boost, either from the turn, or early enough to use on that leg. Being at 1.6 boost perfect exiting a final turn means that effort for a perfect gas is likely wasted (the second boost only ready near the finish line) you #8217;re better off trying to crunch the opponent, or at least exiting the turn w/o crashing ASAP, to keep or increase your lead, or minimize falling behind more. Every fractional second you are off gas, you are slowing.</TEXT>

As I get excess CR I #8217;ll push all of those to the max of level 2 The other strategy is to use a slug as the bait car when you have big pi gaps in the clusters.

Of course there are times when the brain is on autopilot and you leave one car un run in the cluster. Or you run the bait car directly early on.

    <TEXT>P1 GTR by a long shot, if you can work out the launch. Centenario has great  amp; easy perfect launch and great speed, but horrible at turning, takes forever to complete a turn perfectly, and not that great with handling early gas. On the countdown (at least on iOS), the INSTANT you see the 2, hit and hold down gas. Work out your own timing depending on your reaction times and platform. Needle will bounce off the top, right to the bottom of the green zone and back up. Watch which way needle is going if you miss. If it's red still heading down you missed late. If it's heading up and out barely out of green you jumped the gun. If it's near the top you missed super horribly. If it's just below the green zone in the good range (there's a tiny sliver where the needle bounce is changing direction), don't adjust anything. Maybe 2-5% of the time you'll get those, but unless your timing is consistent to 0.01 second every single time, you're more likely to mess up your other launches than fix those near misses by trying to go a bit earlier or later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hard to remember a scale across a big list, and some people will spread scale and others compress. I think that gives more weight to the wide scale rankers. Will test adding personal column of comment next to ranks, to see if that messes up the avg calculator. So retro cobra r (rank 1, best AND worst in class-era)in a personal comment column ( next to your rank)  #8220; Slightly worse than modern Cobra R #8221; I do wish over time the race database gets filled out more. More objective. currently many unreported car/track combos, and then that becomes a kind of regression calculation (currently have simple graphs) Look up from graph Avg expected time for a 500-550-600pi car on track X is such. And then one can easily deduce if they are doing avg or better with their given car.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would stockpile unless you're short on CR/ until/unless they add GT40 to the super classic spins. In the end probably not gonna make a huge difference if the drop rate on the GT40 stays  lt;2% as usual for epics. Running the class upgrade events you'll get tuning w/o CR which will tilt your balance even more. I think at some point it may be worth using gold for CR, of course leaving enough for epic double downs. Or if you think they'll bring back a GT40 for gold spins (at 140g a pop)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Those bars are deceiving/inaccurate at the least, although I think qualitatively they reflect somewhat the devs intended characteristics for the car. Viper is great at turns but slow at the top end. You #8217;ll notice at high PI speed  amp; accel went up a notch. Consequently, you wouldn #8217;t expect the car to hold as well thru turns. Makes sense. But don #8217;t rely on those bars to set expectations for manually run races whether in story or rivals. The race times database on the car recommendations Google sheet stickies in this reddit you can see (and enter your own) average/good times for car/track/pi. There are lots of gaps but you can see what cars have low times for their given Pi.</TEXT>

In DD just like on every other track, it can only no lift the shallow turns, so after turn 1 I decided to try and micro brake (brake and immediately gas) all the rest of the turns.

    <TEXT>Trade off I think on the waiting is that you are now much further behind. After my turn 1 crash opp woulda been halfway down straight before I was up to speed to boost. I went from near dead stop to a static trailing I think mostly due to the boost. These crash restarts are kind of variable so I think a better test of your theory is a turn 1 split time in a slow car off a perfect launch. 1 boost the instant the single boost is ready. 2 boost at the time you think of as up to speed. Not good on a Focus or SkylineII since they #8217;re so quickly up to speed. Maybe Silvia? Or a 2008 M3? Easy to perfect launch but only a middling launch accel.</TEXT>

Fortunately spinning another escort won #8217;t be that hard, and that supposedly brings back all progress. If you #8217;re up at the level you can autorace class brake upgrade and spotlight 3. I figure spotlight 3 plus daily login each day will increment you to a spyder eventually too, people say spotlight drops epics a little higher than usual.

    <TEXT>720 is a bit slidey, better than F1  amp; 570s, all are very capable if you can hit at least perfect/great combos. In rivals DD I #8217;d blown most everything up to turn 3 vs a GTR around +30pi so I tried to nail its rear from behind and missed wide right. I think I #8217;d been tuning my timing based on the 2008 M3 where if you wait too long on the early gas you hardly swing wide and don #8217;t even make contact. One thing I #8217;d noticed is the AI car seems to jump big gaps when you miss turns from in front, eg on Bay1 or 2. I would think getting to the turn first off a perfect launch and brake vs a slow starter car, early gas on Bay1 would increase the gap, but the look back cut they #8217;re right on my tail. Same thing after a double boost downhill to Bay2, sometimes I feel on perf brake/early gas ( to get a bigger lead) the trailing AI is way closer than expected, vs a double perfect where on the look back the AI is barely arriving at the turn. Whereas from behind esp on Bay2 the early gas definitely closes the gap. Still haven #8217;t worked out a best strategy on Bay3 when I get inside passed in the lead up to the turn. Even when on the look back after turn2 the AI is a few lengths behind, it often gets inside track, despite my hitting brake zone first, and perfect braking. Maybe a slightly late brake?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For muscles try retro Cobra R as opp. GTO 2nd choice. Modern Cobra R 3rd choice. Sometimes Boss 302. Have gotten burned a few times vs modern Cobra  amp; Boss so I #8217;ll only take those with my stronger muscles, or shrink the PI diff. 35pi is pretty doable. 40 you gotta be sharper  amp; get a weak opp. I feel like difficulty gets steeper  gt;45pi For sure for sure if you are trailing, early gas on SB3 and Bay2 is more reliable than getting perfect gas for the extra half boost. The win is way more important than the extra 25pts (reminder to self). Only try for the double perfect if you #8217;ve got a big lead entering the turn. You gotta learn how much a given car can stand early gas though. Most cars on SB3  amp; Bay2 once you #8217;re 2/3 of the way thru the turn you can gas early without eating much or any curb. Some you can even stay floored on the gas all the way thru. Practice on Ep1-1-2. One of each track. On DD it #8217;s harder. All turns are the same 90 deg. The key is what to do on DD3. Decide on the fly after you braked - a perfect brake gets you a half boost. My rule of thumb is if you #8217;re not  gt;0.25 or 1.25 boosts after the brake, even a perfect gas taking you to 1.75 is little help since you #8217;ll get to 2.0 boost late in the backstretch. So there I #8217;ll gas the earliest my given car can handle w/o jumping the curb.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take your charger as high as possible and try  amp; live with it until you get stuck. I had a 300sl get stuck at 3.9* for 1.5 months, along comes a Stingray spotlight, I dominate daily figuring the occasional sport classic dupe chips from that will eventually advance my 300sl. spotlight pops my stingray from 2* to 4*, and it #8217;s not until 2 weeks later that my 300sl hits 4 *. My gut feeling is that advancing whatever 4* you have will get you your favored cars advanced faster than just sitting and waiting. If you can almost finish the muscle brake event, one path has classic 5000 chips = 1 spin 2x per week (even if you quit, you keep the chips). The classic chips in intake are only 3000, so it might take you almost 2x longer. Trade off is using up CR  amp; tuning kits and parts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congrats, based on the title and SkylineII being spotlight this week I had assumed it would be that. A 4* epic is still useful for auto racing at cranked up Pi, and once you learn its tendencies you can make the most of the situations when you actually have to race the Viper. Great launch, great turning, slow top speed. Try and nail the launch  amp; early perfects to build up a big enough lead to hold on for the finish. Especially on the final turn gas, work out whether you are helped much by that half boost of a perfect gas (or the 1/3 boost of a great gas if you miss). Having 1.6 boost on the homestretch is often worse than having 1.1 boost but gassing out of that final turn a half second early.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like others have said, wait until your tire smoking stops at the least. Sometimes it doesn't do the cutaway to external view but based on past runs in the same car you can guess where you're not sliding much any more. On Bay1 I wait also until my front wheels are no longer sharply angled/drifting (from the external view), from behind car view, about when it looks like you wouldnt hit the wall until halfway downhill if your straightlined your current orientation. Maybe a 3-4 count out of the gas zone. None after Bay 2 unless I so messed up start  amp; Bay1 (too much gas + late brake, or good brake + good gas) that I'm only at 1.5 boost midway down hill. Then I'll burn the single and try and decide, brake  amp; early gas (grippy car), or try and double perfect Bay2 and use single boost (for bad sliders where early gas is all sorts of mess, especially if you're outside car). Bay 3 I usually kick it about where I feel I'm somewhat straight, midway thru the wall black/white markers. Earlier as possible if it's a 300sl, 35thSuper Sport, Boss302, which often go sideways on landings. Those if my double boost isn't ready within 2 seconds out of Bay3 I'll do single single. Basically if you see/hear your own tire screeching, wait a beat until it stops before kicking the boost in. There are always some exceptions, e.g. DD3 if you successfully shoved opp up the sidewalk, I tend to boost now the instant I break contact, a few times waited a sec too long and they dropped back down in front and boosted away. Maybe the different outcomes are due to the opp boost state rather than what I did, but anyway, I figure it can't hurt to be somewhat in the way when they try and boost either way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on your driving style. Huracan might be a shade faster on straights, and pretty easy to perfect launch. But finishing turns takes forever, and it doesn't like early gas much. GTR already 3\*. It might take you 1 week or 1 month or longer to get your Huracan 3\* (your best chance was the spotlight a few weeks back). Total luck of the draw. GTR has a very twitchy launch, not easy to get a lot of perfects. But decent launch speed even if only in good zone. Holds turns really well and pretty fast, though not the fastest on straights. I'd go with the GTR, since it's already 3\*, and because those slo mo turns in the Huracan and many other Lambos (aside from the Miura) are pretty annoying to me. If I were racing myself head to head these 2 at same PI, I think I would win in the GTR on DD and Bay, in the Huracan on SB.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Forza Street Rivals took on a GT40 662PI with my P1 613PI, ended up on Bayside. Perfect launch, perfect brake, great gas, and on the lookback the GT40 is right on my tail! Double boost down, perfect brake, early gas (maybe 2/3 through turn 2) knowing that a P1 has decent but not very top max speed vs GT40 which is very fast but slow starter. That it was right on my tail after turn 1 was worrying (why I early gassed 2). Perfect brake, perfect gas turn 3, look back it's maybe 2 lengths back (too close for comfort), hit my double boost, it hits its boost a second from the ramp (at which point it's right on my bumper and I know the race is lost), passed on the landing, YOU LOSE. Maybe I just bit off more than I could chew (+49PI), but not sure how I could have done better. Early gas out of turn 1 for more gap? Very early gas turn 2 (1/2 way vs 2/3?) Early gas 3 for more gap and later double boost, or late brake 3 to hit the turn sooner? Anyway as I push my cars to higher PI I generally feel there's smaller margins to mess up in Rivals. Is this a general tendency, e.g. some cars (e.g. Epics) look spectacular in the 3\* zone (low 500s up to 585pi), but once you're above 600 there's some flattening of the differential? I notice a lot of comments about the Centenario being a horrible car but so far in using mine (taken up to 510pi) it was smashing the Rivals AI car (usually taking on a GT40 or SkylineII, with a +40-45PI differential) by more than even my Senna or P1 could currently. But it's been a while since those were in the low 500s in PI, and back there those had seemed near invincible too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, getting to the point where my top cars Level 1 auto race everything in class upgrade, and some can do Level 2. The non restricted races are mostly a shade lower, so might be good where you don #8217;t want to burn your era car slot (eg manual race at level 3 the final race, to have one left over if you blow it). Ben Franklin and the student driver placard language I thought are mostly a USA/ North American thing - I thought you mentioned being in Europe?

    <TEXT>You can spend gold from story or rivals or the every 4 hr check-in, which directly gives CR (500 1200 or 2200) or 10g which you can in turn use to buy CR via the spin pack (40g for one spin, min 10k CR, max 30k). The 5 spin pack is ever so slightly cheaper at 190g. The other thing I do is spam Ep 112 either auto-race level3 or manually level 4, depending on whether I have more game energy, or attention span. Yes that gets you more tuning kits too, but the imbalance is the smallest possible (~300CR for 400 tunits) (I #8217;m assuming you already hit up generic upgrade and spotlight for the scattered CR. and event finish or domination CR)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right, but if you do story at all after domination just do Ep 112, only 300 chips per card, 3 races at max = 5 cards, yield ~1500CR for 7 energy. Or at autorace lvl3, = 3 cards, ~900CR. The tuning kits are all 400 unit, but the CR from the cards are random 200-400, but mostly average 300.</TEXT>

Even among my favorite retros though, most are on the slow side for their class (just the best for their era), or weak on turns when they have speed (e.g. F1). It #8217;ll be interesting whether/how they flesh out this era if and when the hinted at retro episode ever comes out. And are any of the coming Alfa #8217;s retro?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What caprimulgasAU said. Don #8217;t sweat all the extra tuning kits you will have. given the choice to get 200 tuning and 200CR for 2 energy, vs 400 tuning and 300CR for 2 energy, which do you pick? The 4 hourly Check-In is the only free way to get CR without picking up tuning if you #8217;re that OCD. car dupes you also come out slightly ahead. A 2* car dupe gets you 2 stage 2 class tuning kits (which cost 400Cr each to use) and 1120CR so you #8217;re 300CR ahead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right but it #8217;s not like they #8217;ll ever give you gold for CR. So let #8217;s call 4M enough for 40 upgrades of 100k CR each. Do you have that many backlogged, and won #8217;t you have even more CR by then ( so might as well use some of the generics to speed up upgrade rate?). To me only makes sense to wait if something else is rate limiting as well. (E.g. short on suspensions, don #8217;t tune up to the upgrade PI until you get the parts, or need to beat/autorace an event node). By the time the parts are ready you might have or not, enough class tuners to get to the upgrade PI. If the parts are ready, I #8217;ll often just use generic tuners to fill up to the upgrade Pi rather than wait to the next class event to get class specific tunes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, the carousel is fake. Once you committed to the spin the card is gone, the car is won. I once got an Xbox achievement alert the instant I started a spin, and voila, new epic car, next garage level, etc. I think once you even see the hold button to start the spin you #8217;ve passed the point of return. Never experimented to quit game by killing the window at that point. But bet it #8217;s still card gone car won. What you may have stumbled on is the tip off on what new car you won, before the spin animation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>New car so wasn #8217;t sure if I would regret it, taking on the unknown ALFA in Rivals. GT on the slow side, but in a slow launch session, so took it on at +37pi. Managed a perfect launch and seeing the Zagato shrink in the rear view, looked promising. No late bursts of speed from the Zagato. Easy win. Seems to follow the pattern of slow retros game wide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bayside, so maybe not enough room to build up a head of steam? Anyway it was so far back on the downhill I tried for double perfect on 2, but since I was full double boost before gas zone on 3 decided to slightly early gas out rather than wait for trouble since the GT is slowish. I was almost to the ramp before it showed rounding turn 3 so I knew I was safely home. Also the margins for wins shrink at higher PI so my win at 586 PI easier than +37PI in the mid 600s Anyway, on SB I really try for 2-1-2 on my boosts, or 2-1-11 micro braking turn 3 if AI close. Only 1-2-1 if I can #8217;t swing 2 outta 3 perfects on opening launch/brake/gas. Those late bursts on SB kill you, Focus and RS200 have blown by me in poorly run races where I thought I was safe- feels like a double out of turn 3 or enough for a single single combo in the stretch is a minimum to hold off those late surges. The AI level seems non- linear. In the 500s +40 is easy, +45 is kinda tough, and +50 it sorta declares you have no business beating even a Focus/RS200 if you messed up a turn.</TEXT>

If you have the patience wait for another Focus as opponent, win vs +30pi should be possible with that too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last epic Rivals car left, long way off from next tier so took on the epic ALFA at +19pi. Probably should have restarted to take it on in a good launch session, but oh well. Nowhere close, and its slow launch almost as bad as GT40 based on how small it gets on the look back. Of course I usually take on GT40 at +40pi so the ALFA is not quite as bad As further evidence that Rivals does not use user garages for anything in Rivals (not PI, paint color, etc) I saw the ALFA as being user  #8220;kathees #8221; car - so unless they prerelease to select users, they borrow nothing but the name!</TEXT>
