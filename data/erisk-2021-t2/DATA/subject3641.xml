    <TITLE>leaving this shit</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-02 17:03:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>hello!assalam-o-alaikum!you all would be great .my age is 16 .my age was 13 when one of my fucking friend masturbated my dick that was my first time i was so happy and enjoyed it but i was not aware of the upcoming issues that critically affected my life.i started doing it daily .slowly slowly i was becoming weird but i ignored it then my friend told me the word sex its meaning and how males do sex with females i was quiet shocked that this is how things happen but my friend told me in the wrong way .he told me some sites where you could see naked girls etc i was too much involved in this then after 2 to3 months my life was completely disturbed . whenever i talk to someone my voice starts crumbling my hands shaking i started feeling weird to talk to anybody even my family members because my confidence level was zerooo then i still ignored it i done this thing absolutely 4 years today my age is 16 and i am writing this so that it can give me more motivation to leave it .i was so much involved that i see every girl with bad eyes and bad thinking porn was like nucleus and my body was neutron proton which revolved around it .today after that i realized that i am destroying my life.i saw on internet that masturbation has no effects it is normal to do once in a day but ithink doing once destroys your whole power and mindset today my age is 16 and today date is 8-2-2020 i am still not recoverd but i promise my self that i will control this thing .i will not allow it to destroy my life although it has destoyed too much but still i am firm and determine i will change my life thats it guys aim for the moon if you miss you might hit a star so belive in yourself and took oath to leave this shit because sex is not everything remeber your god and remember that your life is like water buble which can be dead anytime anywhere bye the way my english is very bad</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the truth is that when you fap your confidence decreases and way of talking and seeing becomes weird so people consider you a weird guy when you do no fap your way of talking changes you look fresh and confident which attracts people that includes boys and girls both not in that way but in friends way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello AoA! I remember when I opened cam chat on Google 2 weeks ago I found that every single men older than me(I am 16) were fappping I was shocked that the world is so much involved in this .the biggest problem is porn industry it has changed the mindset we see every women in a different way ! This is the reason rapes cases are increasing If you want to be a fapstranaut you have to leave porn And don't be stressed because new nofappers think what should we do else than fap My brothers get out of your fucking room don't be alone go in gathering this is critical situation you all have to choose today and took oath to not do again You will fail certain times because it's year of addiction it's gonna take time but not that much if your heart is rock strong  #128170; #128156; Decide now stop or never stop your choice</TEXT>
