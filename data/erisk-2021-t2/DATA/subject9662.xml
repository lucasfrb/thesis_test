    <TEXT>I'm in the same exact boat, and that's exactly why I looked up this thread. I thought everyone was having issues, but two of my buddies got theirs in today. I called the number from the congrats letter and the guy said that boxes should be arriving today or tomorrow with or without tracking....which is uncomfortable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Drask Lantern works great! If you look closely you can actually see me using it in a few of the clips. In the description I listed alternative builds and there are some Drask builds there for people who prefer to hit harder over faster. But yes, it does work with the malk and prism! The Embermane one is just my preference and is also a lot safer for those who might not be as used to playing Repeaters. Thanks for the comment (=</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's the name of this style of Widget?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-17 15:39:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi friends, I'm looking to move from Streamlabs OBS to OBS studio, and with that, I lose the widget/apps I'm currently subscribed to Streamlabs for. I am a new streamer. I am looking for the name of this style of widget (linked below). I've tried looking at sites like VisualsbyImpulse and Nerd or Die, but most just have event lists that stay on screen. I'm looking for something that pops up in a single spot every 60 seconds or so.  #8203; If this isn't the right location for this post, can someone please direct me to where I should post? Thanks [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu5SUJGc\_vs amp;feature=youtu.be amp;ab\_channel=GhostlyTuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu5SUJGc_vs amp;feature=youtu.be amp;ab_channel=GhostlyTuna)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, right now I am using "Stream Ticker" on Streamlabs Prime, which every 60 seconds, will pop up one at a time, displaying latest follower, subscriber, bits, donations, ect; Then it fades off screen again. I'm not sure what this type of widget or source would be called or where to find one.</TEXT>
