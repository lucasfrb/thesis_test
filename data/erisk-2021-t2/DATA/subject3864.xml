    <TITLE>Loud Playstation - does it make sense to upgrade</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-16 08:28:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I bought my Playstation 4 in the summer of '14, and I have gotten many good hours on gaming with it so far. Overthe last couple of years, the Playstation has been getting progressively louder and louder, to the point that I can't use it to stream music or TV while I'm having friends over, lest I want to ruin the hangout with the sound of a fighter jet in my living room. Naturally, I've done what I can do to clean it. I bought the right tools to open it up with and I've been dusting it out (albeit, only once) but it is still just as loud. Now my roommate and I are playing RDR2 on it, and it's painful to play AAA games when you're doing it without headphones. This kinda ruins the enjoyment of playing a game with other people. So - I'm considering to get myself a new one, and with the Black Friday sales coming up, it seems like the right time. I've been looking at the pro and slim version, and as far as I've been able to tell, both of them are prone to getting loud as well. I'm hoping that anyone who's made the switch for the same reasons, could share their experiences with switching out the console.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-08 12:39:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>After the release Fallout: New Vegas, the game only managed to score an 84 aggregate Metacritic review, prompting Berthesda to withdraw the Obsidians development development bonus. This decision almost killed Obsidian, as they were facing troubles with the production of South Park: Stick of Truth. Fortunately for the employees (and us, I suppose), the company managed to survive and put out more quality games. [https://www.engadget.com/2012/03/15/obsidian-missed-fallout-new-vegas-metacritic-bonus-by-one-point/?guccounter=1](https://www.engadget.com/2012/03/15/obsidian-missed-fallout-new-vegas-metacritic-bonus-by-one-point/?guccounter=1)  #8203; I'm wondering if Todd is getting his bonus withdrawn for Fallout 76, considering they only have a Metacritic score of 49/52.</TEXT>

Does anyone here have any experience climbing/walking a mountain, and would you have wished you brought something you didn't think of until it was too late?

    <TEXT>On the Simpsons subreddit, screenshots are flaired with SxxExx, which makes that particular episode easy to find in case you want to watch that episode. Since subscribing to the Simpsons sub, I've been rewatching some classics that I haven't watched in a long ass time, but when I see screenshots here, I'd have to ask what episode things are from. I know, it's not that hard to search my way to find the episodes, but I think that adding a flair would be really nice in getting an overview and also, potentially, avoiding too many reposts of the same jokes.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questions to Americans: why is there a lack of willingness to vote for other parties than Democrats and Republicans?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-11 17:53:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>It seems like the US is, and always have been, divided into a two-party state where voters are left with only two options. With its large population, I find it hard to believe that the beliefs held by the two main parties are efficient in protecting the values held by all of their voters. Almost every time there is an election in the US, you always see people who are, instead of voting for one party, voting against the other, and are dissatisfied with both of the parties. But even though so many people are complaining about both parties, this isn't reflected in either the Senate, Congress or in the White House - instead it seems like each election period is about gaining a total majority, and where a party fails to gain control of both houses, it often leads to gridlock. As a European citizen, I enjoy being able to change my vote from election to election, allowing me to vote for parties on a wider ideological spectrum. For example, if I consider myself to be a socialist, but I don't want to vote for the main Socialist party, I am still able to vote for another party with socialists beliefs, but with a policy record/agenda that better suits my interests. If that party fails to uphold my interests, I am able to vote for another party at the coming election that better suits my needs, rather than being forced to vote for a party that I do not consider to be protecting the values which I find important in society. I am confused as to why Americans (who often claims, and rightfully so, to be a bastion of democracy) accepts the conditions of not having these important political nuances reflected in their representative institutions. As far as I've read, voting for a third party is a laughable action that is typically deemed to be pointless, but why is that exactly? I do understand why voting for a third party in the presidential election may not be a "strategically smart move", but it seems odd to me, that if you do not like the candidate presented by the Republicans or Democrats, you still accept to choose between the lesser of two evils. What I don't understand is why this frame of mind is maintained in the elections for Senate, Congress or Governorship. So my question is: why are there no, aside from a couple of independent politicians, political nuances in your representative institutions? I'm not interested in anyone's personal political views, but rather an explanation of the lack of interest in third parties.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: For anyone that have physical tickets for the December concert in France</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-28 14:46:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have just talked to Ticketnets costumer service, as I had not received my refund for the concert yet. They informed me that I would have to send them a physical mail with my concert tickets, which I had not previously been informed about. After some mild mannered discussion with the helpful customer service employee, I was allowed to send it to them by email. This was only because I argued that asking me to pay an additional cost of shipping the tickets to France, would be an act of gross misconduct insofar that they would not also refund my additional shipping costs. If you have not yet gotten your refund for your physical tickets you need to contact them, at least, before March, as that is the ultimate deadline for applying for a refund. There is no phone number listed on their website to get in touch with Tcketnet, but I found their phone number on this website: [https://customercarecontacts.com/ticketmaster-contact-customer-service-phone-of-ticketmaster/](https://customercarecontacts.com/ticketmaster-contact-customer-service-phone-of-ticketmaster/). The phone number is +33-1-49-97-51-91.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone else feel like this is more a Disney mashup game than Kingdom Hearts?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-03 22:02:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in the middle of the Frozen world, and honestly I'm kinda starting to be a little bummed out with the games lack of actual story and vast emptiness. Don't get me wrong, I'm having fun, but I feel like this game is leaving a lot to be desired and at this point it feels more like a Disney commercial (theme parks and films) rather than what Kingdom Hearts actually used to be. I was looking forward to the Monsters Inc. world but it felt so linear and dull with no real story or drive. At this point I'm kinda catching myself thinking that I hope they don't make more.. Edit: and what's up with 100 Acre Woods? It seemed like more of an afterthought, like "oh shit we forgot to add Winie the Pooh, let's just make some quick scenes and have them play this dumb game 3 times"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last time I saw my dad he was talking about how he'd like to get better at speaking English, both at a conversational and a business level. So I was thinking that I wanted to get him a book in English or something else that might help him in increasing his vocabulary. He plays guitar and has a big interest in music, although normally he reads Scandinavian crime books. Can anyone suggest me a good book in either of these categories which is fairly easy to read for a non-native speaker, and can help with vocabulary without being too hard of a read?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My roommate and I were listening to Cyboogie and Fishing for Fishies this morning, when my roommate suddenly says "I don't think the story is about a robot, but about the evolution of mankind". I think he's absolutely right! I guess we'll have to wait until the album is released to get the full story, but the album starts out with fishing, which is similar to the simple beginning of humanity, and ends up with Cyboogie, which is a symbol of the "dystopian" future we're living in today where we are all living as part robots, unable to disconnect to the world and our electronics. What do you guys think about this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm having an issue with my laptop charger (the cable is starting to get unstable and keeps disconnecting), so I've figured its best to change it out as soon as possible, rather than wait until it won't work anymore. On the charger itself, it says that the output voltage is 19V --- 3.42A and the input is 100-240V \~ 50-60Hz 1.5A. I found a charger online for my specific computer model, but I'm uncertain if it matches up with what my computer actually takes, based on the numbers on my current charger. Here it says that the voltage is 19V and the current is 2.37A with 45W power. I would really appreciate it if someone could explain to me whether this would be fine, or if it could be damaging to my computer to use a charger that is not 100% the same as the one I got with the computer.</TEXT>

Their history is so closely connected to all of Europe, for better and worse, that any European must get the same heavy feeling in their heart when they watch it. Bless them for writing such a brilliant song, and bless them for such a beautiful piece of art, that this video is. That it's all. I'll watch it again and go to bed now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone has created a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_rallies), linking from the primaries main page, which gives an overview of the candidates' rallies. So far the list only contains Bernie, Biden, Warren and Ojeda rallies, so please start adding Yangs rallies to the list. I don't know much about Wikipedia's rules, but I don't think a YouTube link is a valid reference, so instead try and find a local news article containing a video of the rally in it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reinstalling windows after 0xc000021a stop code</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-12 10:44:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>My friends computer recently crapped out with a blue screen and the 0xc000021a stop code. We have been looking for some different solutions, so that my friend can keep his files, but we have begun to accept that his won't be possible, so we're now doing a complete reinstall of windows, following the instructions from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/cm1z60/0xc000021a_bsod_prevents_me_from_booting_to/). Now we're in the middle of the installation process, and are being asked where to install windows. On my friends computer, there are 6 partitions: Drive 0 Partition 1: SYSTEM\_DRV - Total size 260 MB, free space 227 MB - Type: System Drive 0 Partition 2 - Total size 16 MB, free space 16 MB - Type: MSR (Reserved) Drive 0 Partition 3: Windows - Total size 99.0 GB, free space 14.0 GB - Type: Primary Drive 0 Partition 4: WINRE\_DRV - Total size 1000.0 MB, free space 574.0 MB - Type: Recovery Drive 0 Partition 5: LENOVO\_PART - Total size 18.0 GB, free space 3.2 GB - Type: Recovery Drive 0 Partition 6: LRS\_ESP - Total size 1000.0 MB, free space 473.0 MB - Type: OEM (Reserved) The reinstall version of windows takes up 18358 MB, and I realize that I can't just install it on any of the partitions, because it takes up too much space. I saw [this windows help page](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-do-i-format-a-drive-to-install-windows-10-pro/74c039cf-6846-4bad-9299-893d5466a6dd) where it suggested that all the partitions should be deleted, until there is only one left, and then the install file will automatically create the new partitions that are needed. I'm just wondering if this is the correct approach, my initial idea would be to simply format the primary partition to clear up space and whatever corrupted windows file there is - but I'm also concerned that this would delete important system files.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm watching Andrews climate town hall, and when he was asked who he would turn to in order to achieve some of his more advanced ideas, he responded that he knows Elon Musk wants to work on this. That made me wonder if perhaps he is considering to offer Elon a cabinet position directly related to the furthering of Andrews climate plan. But then again, would Elon even have time for that? I'm not American and haven't been too involved in American politics before the previous election, but is it normal for a primary candidate to announce potential cabinet spots during the campaign? I know Ted Cruz announced his VP pick during the primaries, but other than that, I don't know.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The real reason Clinton is suddenly coming after Gabbard</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-21 19:08:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>This whole thing is fishy as hell, why would Clinton go into the public discussion and accuse a candidate of being a Russian spy? It might be because of the history Gabbard has with Clinton, or it might be because she's trying to sink Gabbard's campaign, or even that Clinton is genuinely worried about Gabbard's involvement with the Russians (I lost some IQ points for writing that, sorry), as some people are suggesting. I think the real reason Clinton is coming out this way now, is not to hurt Gabbard but instead to boost her in the polls. That might sound crazy, but think about it - you can say what you want about Clinton, but she's not dumb, she is influential, political aware and knows how to manipulate voter segments. She must be 100% aware that there is a large group of people that hates her guts with a passion, in both parties. Most of the people that hate Clinton within the Democratic party, would never consider voting for any of the establishment candidates, and instead go to someone like Bernie or Gabbard. With her statement, she has given Gabbard a significant media boost, and potentially also a supporter boost. This raises the question, which voters is Clinton attempting to shift to Gabbard? Personally, I think Clinton is trying to move a group of voters, who may be very emotional and may feel compassion and interest in Gabbard, from Sanders to Gabbard. This voter bloc is probably not very big, I'm guessing smaller than 2% of the voting population, but here it is important to remember that in order to gain any delegates in Iowa, you need a minimum of 15% of the votes, so if Bernie is standing to get 16% and a small group of voters move to Gabbard as a result of this, he might loose all of the delegates in that State. Considering that the under the new rules super delegates gets to vote if no candidate gets more than 50% by the first vote, and the number of candidates that are running, I think it is very likely that there are interests in splitting votes to increase the establishments odds. I'm not saying that Gabbad is running to spoil Sanders' campaign or anything like that, but I suspect that that is Clinton's ultimate goal.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is it more expensive to purchase a digital copy of a game than a physical?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-07 17:37:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seriously, every time a new game comes out for the PlayStation, it's always over 10% more expensive to buy it in the PlayStation store than to get the physical copy at a retail store. The new game 'Death Stranding' is  #8364;69,99, while some stores sell it for as low as  #8364;53. That doesn't make any sense at all, there's additional costs associated with producing the disc and the box, as well as retail agreements with the stores and so on. How can it be justified to charge so much more when it is significantly cheaper for everyone involved to produce a digital copy?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Automatisering i Danmark</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-07 22:19:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Efter at have fulgt med i Andrew Yangs pr #230;sidentkampagne i USA, har jeg t #230;nkt en del over hvordan automatisering og digitalisering af arbejde kommer til, at p #229;virke fremtiden p #229; det Danske arbejdsmarked. Selvom vores arbejdsmarked ser v #230;sentligt anderledes ud end det Amerikanske, eksistere mange af de typer af arbejde, der kan automatiseres, ogs #229; i Danmark. Her t #230;nker jeg p #229; jobs som kassemedarbejdere, lastbils chauff #248;rer, advokater, fabriks arbejdere o.s.v.. Jeg har desv #230;rre ikke kunne finde tal for hvor mange personer der er ansat per erhverv - hvis der er nogen der har en god kilde, m #229; de gerne smide den efter mig. Jeg tror at implementeringen af automatisering i Danmark kommer til, som s #229; meget andet, at foreg #229; meget langsomt. Forh #229;bentligt vil det foreg #229; langsomt nok til, at vi kan sikre nogle ordentlige forhold og en god udfasning for dem der mister deres arbejde. Dog tror jeg at vi kommer til at se langt flere selvk #248;rende biler inden for, relativt, kort tid. Det kommer til at g #248;re en p #229;virke  #233;n stor gruppe: taxachauff #248;rer - og det kommer til at ske p #229; en gang. Vi s #229;, da Uber fors #248;gte at operere i Danmark, hvordan taxachauff #248;rerne og politikerne h #229;nderede nye teknologiske udfordringer. Personligt syntes jeg at demonstrerede en grad af modvillighed til teknologisk udvikling, hvilket er en skam. Lidt af et sidespring, men i andre lande har de tilladt Uber, men med krav til at chauff #248;rer skal have taxak #248;rekort. Hvilke tanker har i gjort jer omkring hvilken p #229;virkning den teknologiske udvikling kommer til at have p #229; arbejdsmarkedet i Danmark?</TEXT>

Another example, if you have two children, the first was born when you were 16, still in high school and you were super weak and the second was born when you were 30 after you have gotten a PhD and have become a bodybuilder the size of Schwarzenegger. Assuming they are raised exactly the same way, read the same stories and fed the same food, would the second child be more likely to become smarter and stronger than the first child?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Counterargument to the "VAT is regressive" argument</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-27 20:23:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I keep seeing the same 3 or 4 accounts that go on every single Yang related posts on r/Politics. It's really gross and honestly pretty disheartening to see how much work a small group of people put into lying about Yang. We should be able to disarm them with studies as soon as we see them - one argument I see again and again is how the VAT is regressive, however the [European Council](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/common/publications/studies/vat_rates_structure_final_report.pdf) has found that the VAT in the EU has had a progressive effect due to how certain types of goods are exempt and others are targeted. Essentially, [a VAT can be considered regressive in a short term and a lifelong progressive effect.](https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/altri-atti-convegni/2012-fiscal-policy-growth/Altiparmakov_Arsic.pdf?language_id=1)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do I need an American phone number to call bank?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-10 13:01:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I want to start phone banking tonight, but I don't have an American phone number. I realize the calls are done over the computer, so I won't need to use my phone, but I still have to register a number - can I just put in any number, or does the number need to be confirmed? If I do need an actual number, would it be possible for someone to purchase a cheap kiosk sim card (which I'll naturally pay back for) and verify the number for me?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First phonebanking experience</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-11 02:24:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just did a 4 hour phonebaning session for the first time, even though I only planned to do 1. It was a very interesting experience and I'm really glad I finally did it! Since I'm European it's not really possible for me to donate, so donating my time is the best I can do. Most of the calls were very quick, either cause they hung up or because they just didn't have time - but every now and then you got some calls that made the whole thing worth it! My final call of the evening lasted an hour and a half. I was talking with a baby boomer who, at first, didn't know anything about Yang and when I discussed the freedom dividend with her, she seemed completely turned off by him. That was until I discussed how it was going to be paid for and how Alaska has a yearly dividend. We discussed the economy for a long time until moving on to drug pricing, mental health and autism. Particularly the subject of autism was important to her and when I mentioned that Andrew has a son on the autism spectrum she immediately remembered Evelyn talking about that. Although she refuses to go on YouTube for anything at all, I ended up convincing her to go a town hall event next week and she sounded like she had become Yang curious for sure. It definitely felt like a victory after an evening with a lot of angry people and quick hangups. Please give phonebanking a chance, it's not as bad as you think it is, and it's not hard to start at all! If you just Yang two or three people over a night, you're still making a chance with a segment that will be caucusing, but that we aren't reaching by being online. If you have just an hour tomorrow, give it a chance. If anyone of the international Yang Gang needs help setting up their accounts, send me a message and I'll help you out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Get on over to [yang2020.com/call](https://www.yang2020.com/call/) and start doing some phonebanking. It's really easy to get started, and once you've begun you'll see how easy it is to do the calls. We need 85,000 calls done today, but with your help we can easily get to 100,000! Keep a couple of tabs open while you're doing it: [The Yang Gang community slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TJK7FFVNJ), where people can help you with any problems you might have, or help you answer questions you didn't think you'd be getting.

    <TEXT>We are so far behind on our targets for phonebanking, yesterday we only had 26 people calling at the peak hours. This isn't good enough at all for a grass roots campaign! A lot of people I talked to places Andrew in a third position after Steyer ams Biden (now I'm even hearing Bennett). Please take an hour and two and don't sleep on Andrew Yang. It's not enough to be motivated online if you don't turn it into something productive. It's super easy, and you'll make some real human connections. Please just do it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If every person on this subreddit worked on this, we just needed to do 5 calls each and the goal would be crushed in no time! It's so important that we reach out to voters and register them so that our canvassers in Iowa have some work to do and won't be wasting their time. I realize it might not be realistic to get everyone on the subreddit to call, but if just a quarter of us pitched in, we could still crush the goal in no time - so why don't you come on over on yang2020.com/call and spend just 10 minutes on getting some quick calls in! It's super easy and pretty fun too when you join the chat on Slack. Your main priority isn't even to convince people to vote for Andrew, just to register potential voters for the amazing people on the ground to take contact to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a little hyperbole to claim that the fear of a new global virus to which there is no cure stems from anti-Asian racism. I'm personally worried about it for a multitude of reasons: it's long lasting effects are unknown, it spreads incredibly quickly, it's already affecting the global economy and may be the catalyst of a (needed) economic recession and it can linger on in your body for 20 something days before you get symptoms, during which you can spread it. Sure, I'm also worried about how China initially handled it and whether they released correct information. Especially considering how they lied about SARS. But that's a critique of a government, not an ethnic group.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-28 08:35:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>A lot of pro-Yang/UBI+VAT candidates have recently announced to be running in various primaries for Congress or Senate. It's really awesome to see, but in order to get them elected, there should be coordinated efforts to get them through the primaries - so I'm wondering if there will be volunteering or phonebanking efforts for these candidates in particular. Personally I'm unable to donate to any candidate, as I am a foreigner, but I would have no problem donating my time to help these candidates get elected as that would ultimately strengthen Yangs case in 2024. Should there be a subreddit solely dedicated to volunteering efforts for the UBI Caucus?</TEXT>

Look at the UBI caucus and see if there's any candidates in Nevada that you can volunteer or donate to. If not you can try and call local legislators or, if you have time and will, try and run yourself in a smaller community to get insider contacts with whom you can establish rapport. Alternatively, be the person who's attending public speaking events and press any legislators that you meet. Just remember to do it with humanity first, being kind gets you a long way!</TEXT>

Alternativet var tiltr #230;kkende fordi jeg er tilh #230;nger af borgerl #248;n, samt en ny politisk kultur. Med Elb #230;k har det ikke rigtigt lykkedes, s #229; jeg valgte at forlade dem ved sidste valg. De fleste jeg har m #248;dt, som stemmer  #197;, er fra forskellige politiske grene, s #229; jeg tror ny ikke at de fleste af deres v #230;lgere n #248;dvendigvis rykker til  #216; eller l #230;ngere til venstre.

    <TEXT>I've always liked Bernie, and while I'm European and can't vote, I was considering whether I would phonebank for him if Yang dropped out. While I agree with some of his points, I do think he's going to far with extending healthcare to dental and eyes, something no other western country offers for free. His supporters also completely turned me off from wanting to work with them, their entire campaign centers around trying to destroy the other candidates. First their target was us and Pete, now they're going hard on Biden - and while I think you should criticize other candidates during an election, you should also have something else to present. Their campaign is just entirely to negative to want to support. That's a shame. If I was American I would still vote Bernie, but I wouldn't volunteer for him like I would Yang, nor would I want to discuss thrat vote with anyone else, like I would if I was voting for Yang.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason there's such negativety towards Bernie's supporters is the fact that they spend months attacking us. Most of the people don't have big problems with Bernie himself, although some may have policy differences, considering that he's anti-nuclear and UBI. The smear campaign run against us by his surrogates is not forgotten.</TEXT>

Yang has started a movement, and the Yang Gang is definitely engaged. People aren't even discussing going Yang or bust for the general, when we're talking about voting Yang it's for the primary.

    <TEXT>Wait, I take that back. On a deeper analysis, it is clear that you're making a reference to two factors: 1. The little mermaid statue has had its head stolen on multiple occasions. In this case you are saying that the Danes have lost their heads - which ties into: 2. The little mermaid is extremely popular with Chinese tourists in particular. Here you are saying that the Danes are losing their minds because of a Chinese disease. There's definitely some layers in this, but I have to consider the poor photoshop in my final grade: you're getting an 8/10 - multi layered trolling, but execution is still poor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The argument against Bernie, related to having multiple houses is kinda silly. He has a place in Vermont, a place in DC and they inherited a house after his parents died. Also, being rich doesn't mean you can't be calling for structural reform, especially if you're raising taxes on yourself included. The other arguments are fine, but we shouldn't start acting like his supporters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're creating makeshift hospitals and they are running out of space for dead people. You don't do that if you have plenty of space. I've sent you evidence for this. I don't know why you need chaos on top of that - overflow does not mean that people are running around in panic. It seems completely logical to me that when a country has thousands of people who, in a very short time and with a large elderly population, get sick with a new respiratory disease that will, in some cases, require hospitalization, that a nation's healthcare systems gets overburdened. No country has an infinite amount of hospital space or doctors. How is that hard to believe? In your mind, what exactly is the purpose of this grand conspiracy?

I'm not claiming chaos or panic, I don't know how it's being represented to you, so I can't say if it's exaggerated. The way I see it, is that this is going to have long lasting economic effects for Italy, and that is cause for concern for other countries who will also be bearing an increased cost for a prolonged period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason that markets are crashing isn't solely due to media panic. It's largely due to fact thai the production chains of a lot of companies are being temporarily halted or complicated - this is what's causing panic, especially in a market that's been oversold for a while. Since the world is as globalized as it is, the economic downturn of one company or country will have a ripple effect on the rest. All the rich people reaped their longterm profits and everyone else are selling out of panic. The markets will go back to normal eventually - right now, or in a couple of weeks, us plebs are given a chance to make an investment on the cheap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But both wars were both horrific and served absolutely no purpose other than guaranteeing profits for a military industrial complex. You're not really addressing the underlying point I'm making though, why should Bernie not be confronted with his vote for Afghanistan when Biden should be confronted with his vote for Iraq? Just because the Iraq war, arguably, has been worse? I don't think either can be held completely responsible, considering the underlying circumstances of the votes (not the outcomes of the war). It just feels hypocritical that Biden is getting painted as a war hawk for his vote on Iraq by a guy that voted for the war in Afghanistan.</TEXT>

Biden has said well before the endorsement that there would be a spot in his cabinet for Andrew. Andrew endorsed Biden because there's no chance for Bernie to win.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Biden said months ago that Yang would be one of the forest people he would call if he won, implying that there's room for him in a potential Biden cabinet. This was white Yang was still in the race. Now some fanatic Bernie supporters are spinning that as if his endorsement was bought. They're freaking out over Bernie's enormous loss and are grasping at straws by deliberately misinterpreting the situation.</TEXT>

He earned [560.000 last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/where-bernie-sanders-money-comes-from.html). So he's probably more in the 2%.

    <TEXT>You do realize that it's been edited, right? What did he say before stating "this is their new hoax"? He's saying that what the Democrats are saying about his handling of the Corona virus is a hoax. Whether that's true or not, that's a different discussion. I don't like Trump, but this is edited in a scummy way and it's making people seem like hypocritical liars when they're sharing it. I've been noticing these false edits and interpretations of trump's speeches pop up more and more recently - its really gross. That's not defending Trump, but it makes it very hard to trust the people editing these videos, as they are clearly pushing an agenda.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's completely besides the point, let's stay on topic instead 9f calling each other names. We can be objective about this. Sure his handling of the Corona virus has been shitty, we can agree on that. However, we're discussing whether or not he called the virus a hoax - which he never did. The video is edited, and not even in a clever way, to make it seem like he's calling the virus a hoax, when he's saying that something else is a hoax (the Democrats perception of his handling of the virus). And yes, you're also right, he completely downplayed the situation and that fucked shit up, but he did not call the virus itself a hoax. He underestimated the threat, something we also see my neighboring country of Sweden do, and something that's going to cost a lot of lives. That's terrible. Point is - it's disingenuous to say he called the virus a hoax when the video is clearly edited. You can admit that without saying that he's handling stuff well - or does looking objectively at the situation make me a "piece of shit spinster"?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cool, I also wouldn't really group the Mexican government in with the conservatives. It's a social democratic party fueled by "left-wing populism" and "left-wing nationalism", if Wikipedia is to be believed at least. Acknowledging that he is a national socialist (by which I assume you mean a socialist that's nationalistic through populism and not a Nazi), should be enough to not plot him in with the conservatives. Especially considering the fact that he is a strong opponent to neo-liberalism, in opposition to the established economic values of the country. He certainly shouldn't be considered a conservative. If you are looking to add a conservative socialist, however, you should look into President Lukashenko of Belarus. He has been handling the crisis absolutely abhorrently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been thinking about this show for the last couple of days, but I just can't remember the name of it. It was sorta a quirky show about a guy who had a one night stand with a woman who went to jail, she ended up getting pregnant and executed, so he was left alone with the baby in his parents house. Most of the story premises were based on their poverty and weirdness. I'm pretty sure their last name was Chance, and that might also have been in the title. I think the show went on sometime between 2009-2014-ish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This feels like controlled opposition to me. Every single time networks are improved people are worried that the waves will spread diseases like cancer and kill the children. Every single time that turns out not to be true. There are very legitimate reasons to be concerned with 5G networks, such as the improved ability to spy and triangulate citizens, since the antennas need to be much closer to one another. Whenever this argument here is getting raised, it's becoming harder and harder to have an actual discussion about the societal problems of 5G without immediately being dismissed as a nut.</TEXT>

Every single country aside from the US is already providing a decent minimum wage and healthcare, that's not being discussed anywhere else. This is really very Americacentric and yet you're calling it a global takeover. It doesn't really make sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would argue that Spain and the US are pretty comparable in that regard. Spain had +1000 cases on the 8th of March and the US had +1000 on the 11th of March. Going by the timelines I can find, it actually seems like the first case in the US was on the 21st of January and Spains first case was registered on the 31st of January. I don't have time to do the math right now, but if we look at the numbers for cases per million, I'm sure the outbreak in the US really started taking hold a bit later than Spain. But in either case, you can't make a one-to-one comparison because the climate, density and culture are very different.</TEXT>

I just looked at the graphs, it seems that Spain is now at 409 and the US has climbed to 101. I hope the increases will start to stagnate soon.. what really worries me is that, despite of of the death rate "only" being around 6%, if you only look at the closed cases, the death rate appears to be at 20%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The difference is the purpose. The CCP destroyed all cultural heritage with the intent of replacing it with a new culture sculpted in the ideology of the party. That is not unlike what other authoritarian rulers do through book burnings or destruction of cultural heritage as seen in the middle east with ISIS or as Hitler did in the second world war (that's not to say that they're directly comparable, but it's the same purpose). This has included the destruction of temples, monuments and historical accounts, as well as persecution of religious followers. Moving away from traditional medicine and wetmarkets is a matter would be done with the purpose of improving public health. There is a major difference here, it's not even a question of semantics. I don't think anyone would be whining about shutting down wetmarkets, since they're a notorious hotbed for infectious diseases, something that has been well known since before the spread of Covid-19.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You really sound like you're in denial.. Sweden has handled the Corona virus absolutely terrible. I don't know if you actually started shutting things down, but just last week the limit for how many people could meet was still set at 50. A month ago, your upmost governmental health expert was telling people that they could definitely still go to buffets, even he went to buffets. Your government has been slow and has handled it with the idea of creating a herd immunity. They said yesterday that they expect that to happen in a couple of months. They're doing this because they're afraid of the economic backlash, they're chosing the economy over people - and that is even with a social democratic prime minister. However, looking at South Korea, you may not necessarily be immune just because you've had it once. Sweden criticized Denmark for shutting down our borders and taking it serious very early on. Now Sweden has 1.500 deaths, 600 of which happened within the past week. Denmark and Norway acted similarly - Norway has 164 deaths and Denmark has 346. This is despite all three countries being hit around the same time.</TEXT>

I wouldn't be happy to take advise from there Belgians as they have the highest death rate in Europe and I doubt that such assessments are appropriate. I haven't seen any Germans talk about it that way, they've been handling it much more appropriately. I know your Social Democrats aren't very left wing, neither is ours. But yours is acting like an economically right wing party, which was my point. I mean, even Norway has a right wing government and they're choosing people first. You stay safe too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like this theory, and it would also explain the willful government ineptitude in Sweden compared to Denmark and Norway as Sweden has a significant military industry. Although you're saying that one of the catalysts, for you fueling this conspiracy theory, is that symptoms are only a cough and a fever - the symptoms are more than that, it also includes muscle fatigue, diarrhea, loss of smell and heavy lungs. I don't think you're completely right in that the disease isn't real, but I think you might be right in that governments around the world are using it as a cover to get rid of unwanted and burdensome people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, when people constantly argues against every single thing Trump says, even when he's right, they just come across as intellectually dishonest and they lose credibility when there is actual grounds to criticize him. It's like the boy that yelled wolf. It's as if this group of people is unable to think independently or critically, aa most of them assume that, if you don't criticize everything he does, you must love him. They see no middle ground at all, so it's always black or white. Having that perspective on everything, makes your opinion on most things seem hyperbolic and useless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suppose. Most countries in the world have capitalistic systems, and it's a minority of countries that allow for things longer this. It's not a problem with capitalism, but the political system of the country. A lot of Americans seems to blame capitalism for the worst problems in their country, when in reality the problems are the product of a ridiculous two-party system in which both parties are controlled by corporate interests. Other capitalist countries function rather well and without the problems that Americans are facing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking at everything in that dichotomy is not really appropriate. Germany has been ruled by conservative governments (occasionally mixed with social democrats) for a very long time. Same as Denmark and Norway. Social mechanisms that provides benefits to people are not necessarily socialism and they don't exclude capitalism. The reason we're able to provide our citizens with excellent social benefits and welfare systems is because we also have well functioning capitalism that allow us to gain a solid tax revenue. But yeah, you're right, the problem with America is that you let capitalism run your democracy - but the same applies in deep socialist states where bribery and corruption is running rampant. It's not an ideological problem, but a bribery problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't like Trump, but this story is so dumb. He never told anyone to drink fish cleaner, he was talking about medication which is currently being used to treat malaria disease. At the time, this medication was discussed in various countries as a potential treatment and the medication itself does no harm - just because it is an ingredient in a fish tank cleaning product doesn't mean that it itself is a medical device, that should go without saying. If these people did think that, then they're absolutely retarded - it's like mixing your vitamins with acid, just because there's vitamins in it, it still contains acid. Constantly bringing this up as "evidence" that Trump is handling the Corona virus poorly kinda muddies up the other very legitimate criticisms of him, and comes across as intellectually dishonest which reinforces the narrative that the one group is constantly after Trump. This makes it so much harder for that group to be legitimately criticize Trump. Just like the birther movement against Obama - it was very hard to take that group serious when they had legitimate criticism of him, because the bulk of their arguments were so dumb.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right that when the president speaks, a lot of people listen and a lot of people will automatically assume that the mainstream media is misconstruing what he is saying. Because of this, this group has a large level of scepticism towards anything they report on when it comes to Trump. I think that this group is unable to analyze the information appropriately and just assume that the media is lying, and therefore go out and does the opposite of what they say. So Trump says that thing with the disinfectant, while he doesn't say that people should go out and inject or digest it, the mainstream media makes it sound like that is what he is implying to make him sound dumber than he is. Now the group of sceptics assume that that is indeed what he was implying, but they're sceptical of the medias position that it would be bad for them to do it, so they assume that they're just lying about it being bad, not whether or not that was the implication laid out by Trump I agree with with your position, that this group of sceptics will do what they think Trump wants them to do, but when they're dissecting it from misinformation they get a false understanding of what it is they should be doing. I hope that makes sense, I'm having a hard time formulating it right</TEXT>

At no point did the guy actually say anything positive about Trump, but yet that's what you keep going back to, while denying the actual facts. Trump is an opportunist and he was a registered Democrat for quite some time, he's also been a Republican for quite some time - he's been jumping around wherever ot suits him and he's been a donor for politicians of both parties. Clinton has flown on Epsteins private jet a bunch of times and without his security detail a handful of times.

You've essentially devolved into two groups that are unable to consider your party figures to be bad people, because you have no other options. None of your leaders in newer times have had a positive effect on the world or your country, they're all bought and paid for and acts only for the interests of their donors or themselves. We see that with the Clintons and Trump in respect of their relationship to Epstein, we see it with Obama with the composition of his cabinet and extensive drone use, we see it with Bush 1 and 2 in respect of their wars. That's not really being an enlighted centrist, but rather an outsider who is disgusted with the way your country and your leaders behave. As long as the partisans of the two parties keep denying this, the longer it's going to go on for. I hope that your country will fall as an economic and military superpower and I hope that you all realize what a sick society you're living in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't consider any of them to be half bad, I consider them all to be bad and evil. Obama murdered thousands of innocent civilians including children with the expansion of the drone usage. While I think the actions of Bush in Iraq are far worse, I don't think that exonerates Obamas actions or diminishes them to only be "half-bad". It's cruel and evil - which seems to be the standard for the US foreign policy. Both parties seems to favor perpetual warfare which costs the lives of thousands of innocents, both parties are lead by politicans that are deeply entrenched with Epstein and neither party seeks to make actual change that would significantly better the lives of ordinary Americans. As I said, America is entrenched in evil and the parties are abusing the two-party system to blind people of their own faults. Your country is disgusting and full of brainwashed people that are unable to make an actual change due to your backwards political system. I don't see what that has to do with my self image, I've never murdered anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact that it's always been like that doesn't make it any less sad or divisive. I don't think it's necessarily true that the American is all in lock step, there seems to be quite a lot of difference in opinion among those voters, although I do see what you mean. I also understand why a lot of the American left doesn't want to support the democratic party if they feel like they're not getting the concessions they feel they need. In proper multiparty democratic systems, this isn't really an issue in the same way. Take my country, for example, the Social Democrats are moving further and further to the right both socially and economically to appease to a particular voting bloc that has abandoned the left (largely on immigration issues). This is causing left leaning voters to leave the party and instead support parties that actually represent them. The Social Democrats are forced to give concessions to those parties if they want to stay in power and not risk another election. First-past-the-post systems ends up causing a two party state where the political fringes are typically ignored, that's a shame, because a large segment isn't getting the representation they need.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about the impact of state decisions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-22 08:45:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm studying European and international law, and sometimes we use American federal case law comparatively to discuss issues like duty of care and topics like that. I am currently participating in a course on Corporate Social Responsibility and we have been looking far more to US case law for this course than usually, and I have been noticing that US state courts often use an analysis that has been made in other states on issues that are similar, even though the cases are based on state legislation and not federal legislation. For example, right now I am analyzing the case "A.P. Manufacturing Company v. Barlow", a case that was before New Jerseys Supreme Court in which Barlow, a shareholder, sued A.P. Manufacturing for misuse of corporate funds after it had issued a donation to Princeton University after a new state provision in New Jersey. Reading through this case, I see that the judges consider the concept of reasonableness by analyzing discussion made in an Oklahoman court. So I'm wondering about the impact a state decision has in another state, would a state court only rely on an analysis of another state's court if the provisions or conditions are sufficiently similar? I know that it is not abnormal for common law courts to rely on practices set out by other common law jurisdictions, but is there a defined standard on applying practices and analysis from other American states in particular?</TEXT>

The only evidence presented is that he made his account private, which doesn't really prove that he means it, but rather that a lot of people are brigading him for the statement. That just proves that it caused a Twitter outrage, not whether he stands by it. For saying that you call me unintelligent? I clearly said that the argument is so dumb - in fact it's so dumb that I assume it's a joke because people who openly makes such a statement must either be completely retarded or joking.

    <TEXT>Amnesty International has reported both on [sexual assault](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/12/sexual-violence-against-hong-kong-protesters/) and [torture](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/09/hong-kong-arbitrary-arrests-brutal-beatings-and-torture-in-police-detention-revealed/) of protesters. A young girl was found [floating naked](https://asiatimes.com/2019/10/friends-not-convinced-girls-death-was-suicide/) in the river after participating in protests. Another young girl was [allegedly gang raped by police](http://theindependent.sg/hong-kong-teenager-gets-abortion-after-alleged-gang-rape-by-police/). I found this [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/eo1l01/zoomed_version_of_man_falling_from_police_quarters/) (NSFW!) of a man who allegedly gets pushed out of a window, if you watch it, notice how his body is initially positioned and how the fall brings no reaction. It's a little hard to find English sources on it, but there has been a large number of suicides amongst protesters who have been found in ways that could easily cover up prior abuse, such as throwing a person in the river after getting raped and murdered, or thrown off of a building after getting beat to death. Here is a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dxz3xd/transporting_prisoners_by_train_potentially/) of protesters being transported away by train, presumably to China - I realize this isn't exactly a reliable source and while [Hong Police denies](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/hongkong-protest-11282019000527.html) that they're being sent to the mainland, others [have noted](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10423843/fears-china-shipping-students-from-hong-kong-protests/) that the train line connects to the border. I haven't been able to find any sources that properly follows up on this, but I'm a little limited as I don't speak Chinese, but there is a [history](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/the-case-of-hong-kongs-missing-booksellers.html) of Hong Kong dissidents being sent to China for detention before the protests. We all know that China has intense ["re-education" camps](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/China_hidden_camps) (read, concentration camps). Don't misunderstand this as an attempt to minimize what is happening in America, just because the Hong Kong police is acting worse than the American police, does not mean that the American police is not acting in an unconscionable way. But to go back to your original statement "being a protester in America is currently way more dangerous than in Hong Kong thanks to the militarized police" - currently, I disagree, although, considering the behavior of American police forces, this could almost certainly develop to become worse. If we are speaking about the safety of ordinary people before the respective protests, then it is absolutely more dangerous to get pulled over by a cop in the US than in Hong Kong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a pretty clear difference in the purpose which you are filming for. Filming a cop doing something bad with the purpose of exposing something, or film yourself attending a social cause with the purpose of sharing it to show your friends that you were a part of something. It's a little tricky though, just taking pictures from a protest isn't necessarily virtue signaling. I have an example: me and a friend went to a global warming demonstration last year, but it was raining so much and we didn't expect it. All of our clothes got soaked and we agreed to go find some shelter and eat some lunch, but before we went my friend took a couple of pictures to share on her Instagram with a bunch of hashtags even though we were only there for 20 minutes or so. People can do what they want though, I don't see it as a big problem, although I would say at any given demonstration, there's definitely a handful of people there who are only attending to take some good pictures to give their friends the impression that they care. Another example: when you go on vacation, you usually take a bunch of pictures, but you don't go on vacation to take pictures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand these protests and I support the spirit of them, if this had been a year ago, or even just a couple of months ago, I would have joined them too. But I am so upset that these people are throwing away the hard work and personal sacrifices people have made over the last couple of months and just completely disregarding public safety. People have been without work and without their families for so long now. Things were just starting to go well, but now we're inevitably going to see a continuation and greater spread of Covid because of something that's happening in the US. It's so fucked up and I'm so upset that I will have to be without my family for an even longer period of time. I fucking hate this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely understand all of that, but that is all from an American perspective where these issues are actually pressing. This might be the time for Americans to go out and protest, but not for Europeans who are not actually experiencing these difficulties that you're describing. If there was no virus at all, then it would be more than fine to attend a sympathy protest - but to go out and demonstrate at the cost of the collective work we have been doing, just to show sympathy to a country that would never do the same for us and in which these issues are not new, is not the right thing to do. They're going to be responsible for people not being able to go back to work or see their families for an even longer period of time. They're going to be responsible for a rapid deterioration of our economies, which will to an deterioration of the institutions that have failed in America such as our educational systems and healthcare systems. They are willing to sacrifice that on everybody else's behalf, just so they can show sympathy. That's not a very good trade off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course there's racism in European countries, but not at the same level as in America. Seriously, we are nothing like the USA in terms of our social welfare systems. Your billionaire speaking point doesn't even make sense in a European context - if supply chain fails, people will lose their jobs. If people lose their jobs we lose our national income, if we lose our national income, we lose everything. Capitalism has run amok in America, we are nothing like you, our systems doesn't even compare. Are you honestly saying that European countries should give up on the social progresses in health care and education to go to sympathy protests? If you had free healthcare and education, would you give it up to protest civil rights issues in China?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that protesting isn't forbidden, it isn't in my country either. Just because you're not forbidden from doing it doesn't mean it's not a hotbed for a highly contagious disease we've been trying to avoid for the last couple of months. I'm not saying that racism is a problem exclusive to the US, but their levels of racism and excessive police brutality is not even a comparable measure. If the same level of police brutality was going on in Europe, I might have a different perspective - then it would be our fight, but it's not. Showing sympathy is fine, and at any other time it would be amazing to see, but right now these people are choosing, on behalf of everyone else, to put their families, countries and economies at risk to either demonstrate against racism or to show sympathy for Americans. The time isn't right for either of those. Edit: while neither of your links are relevant, it doesn't exactly support any argument to link something in German.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nu kan en ting ellers godt have flere betydninger. Ja, det er en generation, men som sagt, s #229; bliver det ogs #229; brugt til at beskrive en person der forvolder en form for skade uden at skulle leve med konsekvenserne heraf, uanset alder. Sprog er dynamisk og forandres hele tiden, det har intet med at v #230;re overfladisk eller amerikaniseret at g #248;re.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Det er at amerikansk ord der direkte er overf #248;rt til dansk. Det er hvad amerikanisering er. Hvad med ord som nice, weekend, cool eller random, som du selv bruger?  gt; Det  #248;del #230;gger debatten at man begynder at bruge random meningsl #248;se ord, der intet betyder. Det har du vel til dels ret i, hvis du m #248;der op til en debat og siger ord der ingen betydning har, s #229; er der vel ikke nogen debat. Dog vil jeg da argumentere for, at n #229;r ord er blevet brugt tilstr #230;kkeligt og modtageren endnu ikke forst #229;r det, s #229; m #229; modtageren videreudvikle sin sprogforst #229;else og l #230;re betydningen. Det kan selvf #248;lgelig argumenteres hvor langt modtageren skal g #229;, men hvis man st #229;r som den sidste person der ikke forst #229;r sprogbrug, s #229; m #229; man nok selv l #230;re noget frem for at forvente at alle andre stopper med at bruge det ord. Det kunne man have en meget lang diskussion om, hvorn #229;r er et ord blevet en del af det danske sprogbrug. Men den diskussion t #230;nker jeg er alt for lang og kompliceret til en reddit diskussion.  gt; S #229; er han her jo faktisk en boomer selv if #248;lge sin egen definition? Ja, det vil jeg mene. Gruppen der tager til demonstrationer lige nu er formentlig ikke i en s #229;rbar gruppe, men de kommer til at v #230;re smittespredere. Det er stor boomer mentalitet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Det forst #229;r folk hvad betyder. Det er l #229;neord. Men blev de forst #229;et de f #248;rste gange de blev brugt p #229; dansk? Som sagt, s #229; er sprog dynamisk og l #229;neord bliver hele tiden tilf #248;jet baseret p #229; hvordan, og hvorfra, folk modtager information.  gt;Men ingen ved hvad boomer betyder. Det giver kun mening i amerikansk kontekst. Ja, hvis du beskriver generationen, ikke hvis du bruger det som en beskrivelse af en bestemt attitude. Du har dog ret i, at de fleste nok ikke ved hvad det betyder endnu, men det er s #229; sm #229;t ved at bev #230;ge sig ind i et alment sprogbrug - og nu ved du da i det mindste, at boomer ikke n #248;dvendigvis bruges til at beskrive en generation.  gt;Kan man kalde f.eks. et regnvejr for en boomer hvis man synes regnvejr er tr #230;ls? Jeg tvivler p #229; at regn er et t #230;nkende og selvst #230;ndigt handlende v #230;sen, s #229; nej. Der ville det ikke give mening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Du misforst #229;r begrebet. Man kan tilh #248;re boomer generation (som den kaldes i USA) og man kan have en boomer attitude. Du kan have en boomer attitude som 5  #229;rig, selvom du er fra en anden generation. Man godt v #230;re fra boomer generationen uden at have en boomer attitude. Som du selv har pointeret, s #229; er der ikke noget der hedder boomer generationen p #229; dansk, jeg tror at det rette begreb her ville v #230;re 68'er generationen, dog har vi en anden historie - men det vil hj #230;lpe til at forst #229; at en boomer, p #229; dansk, ikke referer til en generation overhovedet. Det bliver en smule mere kompliceret p #229; engelsk, men der m #229; man pr #248;ve at forst #229; udefra konteksten af samtalen. Det har intet med alder at g #248;re - dog stammer det fra den amerikanske boomer generations attitude overfor klimaforandringer, men det betyder ikke at man ikke kan v #230;re en boomer p #229; andre sp #248;rgsm #229;l. En fodboldklub kan vel godt v #230;re boomer hvis den agerer p #229; en speciel m #229;de, jeg kan ikke lige t #230;nke p #229; et eksempel. En almen forening der k #230;mper i mod klima reform kunne f.eks. godt v #230;re boomer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not true, check out the "Copenhagen Criteria" for the actual list of requirements a country must need before it can apply for membership. You need to have a proper democracy and judicial system, have respect for human rights, enact legislation of Directives and you must join the eurozone. The last point is somewhat funny, considering that it's a part of the Copenhagen Criteria, but Denmark is the only country that is allowed to not move into the eurozone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but from their website it says "The EU does not define health policies, nor the organisation and provision of health services and medical care. Instead, it's action serves to complement national policies and to support corporation between member countries in the field of public health." The health care systems differs vastly country to country - while an EU citizen in another country is entitled to get the same level of care as a national, it doesn't mean that you have to get all services for free. For example, in Denmark it's free to go see your doctor, in the Netherlands you have to pay a fee unless you have private insurance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was responding to this comment "you do realize part of the reason that rich people don't pay taxes is because they donate a lot of money." I don't agree with the argument that a country shouldn't tax rich people so they can donate, rather than taxing rich people to make the appropriate spendings. If that would be the case, then a society is dependent on rich people being benevolent, rather than just having a competent nation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's completely fine, I think tax write offs are a great way to stimulate donations. But chosing not to tax rich people appropriately in the hope that they'll donate to worthy causes isn't a good way to manage a society. There's plenty of reasons why that money is more appropriate to be spent by governments over private individuals - for one, you don't know what the individuals motives are, and secondly, the individual may not have the appropriate level of understanding of the specific issue that the government may otherwise have. Governments aren't benevolent, they're fulfilling a specific purpose which they have been elected to do. It's its job to manage tax money on public spending, it shouldn't be left up for private individuals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it really depends on the country and the existing structures. In my country, the tax rate is around 36% + 8%. I don't think it's wrong to tax people making over a set amount a little more, as long as it's a progressive tax. So if you make 1.100.000 USD, you'll be taxed 36% on first million and 40% on the remaining 100.000. Here we often say that the broadest shoulders takes the broadest burden, because they can afford it. I have a feeling we might disagree on that argument, but that's fine. As far as I understand from American economics, large corporations like Amazon are avoiding paying an appropriate tax by registering in Delaware with a low tax rate - while Bezos' wealth should be considered separately from Amazon itself, it's obvious that the better Amazon is doing, the better Bezos is doing based on his stocks. Delaware's corporate tax rate is 8,7%, which seems insane to me, especially considering that large corporations like Amazon are avoiding paying a federal tax. There's no doubt that the owners of incredibly large corporations have a large net worth based on their stock holdings. I feel like we're digressing a little, and it feels like we agree on the main point that a society shouldn't depend on incredibly rich people, but also that rich people shouldn't be punished for being rich.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So is the whataboutism steering any discussion on Clinton towards Trump. Your country keeps electing corrupt pieces of shit and you keep blaming the other side for it, then you forget the last piece of shit from your side and elect an even worse piece of shit. I would argue that Obama isn't as much of a piece of shit as Clinton, since he doesn't seem to be affiliated with the clusterfuck that Epstein is, but he's still corrupt and murdered thousands of civilians. It's like a shit pendulum that keeps swinging higher and higher. Clinton is groin deep with Epstein and Maxwell, and that warrants serious discussion, even if Trump is also implicated. Trump's association also warrants serious discussion, but we should be able to discuss the two separately.</TEXT>

That's not to say that there aren't some blatant non-conspiracy related posts (which shouldn't be allowed), but these are both for and against Trump.

    <TEXT>It's honestly a rather peculiar situation. As is also discussed in the video, the cl Danish constitution allows freedom of religion, which is why a burka ban is technically illegal to impose, so instead they introduced a ban on face coverings, which has essentially only been enforced on Muslim women wearing a burka. The reasons behind the move and the other 99 new laws by the previous government targeting immigration and muslims is not necessarily because there's a majority of anti muslims in the country. Rather it's because after the previous election, which put the right wing block, lead by the libral and governing party Venstre, in the majority. Despite the Danish People's Party (National conservatives with a somewhat social economic policy) was the largest party after the Social Democrats and the new governing party being the third largest party. The Danish People's Party is notoriously snti Muslim and posed a serious threat to the two parties that have always had the governing position, so Venstre and the Social Democrats were fighting for the anti Muslim voters to diminish DPP. This led to bipartisan efforts to essentially try and get ahead of DPPs policies on the question of immigration and integration. I'd say their efforts worked, since DPP lost incredibly heavily in the latest election, which is both due to the Social Democrats stealing their immigration platform and already having most of their economic policies and the fact that two new more extreme anti Muslim parties became viable for the election.</TEXT>

The chip thing and Covid comment, I agree that that is pretty out there and I certainly don't agree with it. That doesn't mean that he should be equated to being a pedophile nor does it taint his music. Having religion in school is not necessarily a good thing, I wouldn't call it outrageous though considering how religious Americans are and again I don't think it taints his music in any way. I don't know anything about black history month, so I don't know if it's true or not. Maybe he thinks it causes more harm through perpetual victimization? I don't know how a black history month is though. So what if he's pro life? He's very religious. He also said that he wouldn't make abortions illegal, but rather implement measures to give people the means necessary so they aren't forced to go through abortions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No he didn't, that's what the gamerscore said he said. He said that if people still feel like slaves today, then it sounds like a choice. He then continued to say that a lot of people are mentally imprisoned today, further clarifying his statement. Was it eloquently put? No, but you're just parroting sensationalist headlines.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's like we're mentally imprisoned he followed up with. American slavery didn't last 400 years, the country hasn't even existed for 300 years. He's saying that if you still feel like a slave today, it's a choice because you're mentally imprisoned. Again, not very eloquent, but he didn't say that slavery was a choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's clearly talking the present tense, at no punt was he talking about the past tense. I do think it sounds better, but I disagree with his position. There's an underlying race issue in the US that's great than the mentality of people and Kanye is speaking from a position of privilege that most other black people don't have. I personally think it's a misguided viewpoint l, and I agree with the argument you're making. But he never said that slavery is a choice, that's the way the headlines misconstrued the statement. Saying that slavery was a choice would be acting intentionally blind to history, and the people blindly believing the headline interpretation use it as ammunition against him. If you need to criticize him, then criticize his actual position, not a made up one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please explain then, bear in mind that I'm not American - my type of "white people" haven't held power over anyone. Just because some white people held people over some non white people in the past does not mean that a non white person can't hold prejudice and be racist towards someone of another color simply because of their skin color. Any person of any ethnicity can be racist if they are discriminating against another person due to their skin color or ethnicity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's two different things though, you can be racist against someone without exerting power them when you discriminate against someone based on their color of their skin. If you have been robbed by a white guy and you start to assume that all white people are robbers - that's racist. You can also be in a position of power where you can assert your racism to prevent people of another color to gain something, be it through politics or associations. Just because you're not putting people down, you can still hold racist beliefs if you believe that all people of a certain ethnicity or skin color should be treated in a certain way or if you think lesser of them because of the way they look - even if that disgusting worldview doesn't materialize. Following your argument, if I lack political power (which I do, considering that the parties I vote for consistently lose elections), then I can't be racist even if I despise people of another color?</TEXT>

Was directly interfering in Russias elections also an act of war? I know you're saying that "it's in the past", but it destroyed the opportunity for real Russian democracy for generations.

    <TEXT>Sanctions aren't going to move Putin, the Russians are very stubborn and many of them yearn for stability. More sanctions will likely just bolster Putins power as he'll be able to point to outside forces as reasons for the failures of his oligarchy. I don't personally like Putin and I don't think he's helping moving the country forward in any way - but a lot of Russians believe in constant and stable leadership. I believe that the outcome of Yeltsin's leadership, which was the direct result of US involvement, made most Russians lose hope in the democratic process. It made them contrast the democratic failure with the relatively better stability they had during the USSR.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about the US constitution Article VI</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 19:20:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am trying to understand why the US wouldn't be bound by treaties that they have signed, but not yet ratified. I understand that before the ratification of a treaty, it hasn't actually been made into law, but when I am reading the US constitution Article VI, I get a little confused as it states "(...) all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land". Shouldn't this be understood as binding judges to interpret national law in respect of all treaties signed by the US, regardless of their ratification, as the treaty, after having been signed, may be considered as fulfilling the condition of "treaties which shall be made"? I have tried searching around a little, but I haven't been able to find any specific explanation of this, as most discussion on the second clause of this article relates to the supremacy of the constitution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah okay, that makes a lot of sense! So the phrase "all Treaties made, or which shall be made (...)" should be read more literal, as in, "all Treaties entered into prior to this article and Treaties entered into in the future (...)" rather than "all Treaties made and all Treaties that are being prepared". My question comes from the US' lack of ratification of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as its 18th article states that all Member States are obligated not to act contravening to treaties that are signed, but not yet ratified. Your answer clarified it quite well, thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that makes sense, I was thinking that it meant treaties that are in the process of being made, but it should be read more in respect of the time it was written.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you know how often signed treaties are sent to Congress for ratification? There's a number of significant, and some rather old, treaties that has been signed but not yet ratified by the US, so I'm wondering if those treaties are just left until Congress decides to ratify them, or if it must be done on the initiative of the President.</TEXT>
