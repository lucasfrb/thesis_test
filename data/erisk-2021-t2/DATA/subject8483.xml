    <TEXT>So here's the deal with medical expenses and taxes, I literally just reviewed this info for something totally unrelated to medical cannabis. To deduct medical expenses you have to itemize AND those expenses have to be more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. This article explains things pretty well: [https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/health-care/can-i-claim-medical-expenses-on-my-taxes/L1htkVqq9](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/health-care/can-i-claim-medical-expenses-on-my-taxes/L1htkVqq9)  #8203; Also it has to make sense to itemize meaning that you have enough receipts to beat the normal standard deduction (12,200 for single files and 24,400 for married filing jointly) PLUS 7.5% of your AGI.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Cherry Diesel flower from terrapin is great. No experience with any ilera products, but the general opinion of ilera on here doesn't seem great. Any specific reason you're targeting disposables? They are kind of wasteful and prone to issues, the battery shitting the bed before the oil runs out being the primary issue. They're also pretty wasteful from an environmental standpoint. I'd say get the terrapin if you're set on a disposable, but look into regular carts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two years ago the doc that stitched up my hand, a fellow trout fisherman, gave me both sets of forceps and these long ass tweezers from the suture kit he used. For two years those tweezers sat in the back of glove box of my truck. Then last week as I was struggling to get at a bud in the bottom of a container I remembered those tweezers and they suddenly became a beloved piece of kit. I'm sharing this in case anyone else has something similar lying around collecting dust because they really are great for fishing buds out of these tiny containers.  #8203; https://preview.redd.it/iye5e4mp4if41.jpg?width=3024 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=8a6d3c1f97804919964fb3e59d3548a92689d2d6</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean you can, but dumping it knocks all the buds around and knocks off trichromes. Then you have to finger it all back up to put it back in the jar, losing more trichromes in that process. Repeat that enough times over smoking an 1/8th and your last bud is basically mexican ditch weed (just kidding of course). The idea is really to handle the bud as little as possible because those tiny little bits you're losing are the really good shit.</TEXT>

The results have been very consistent 10 of 11 weighed 3.6, the other one was probably 3.68 or 9 because the scale flipped a few times between 3.6 and 3.7 before settling on 3.7.

    <TEXT>Review and Throughts: In total this is my third cut of rythm flower (got my card late jan). I'll be honest from a taste standpoint all 3 are kind of lacking. Smells a little choclately with some citrus notes, but doesn't smell as strong as I'd expect from 32% flower. The taste is very mild similar to smell little choclately with some weedy citrus notes, but again very mild and a little burnt. I bet the taste would be great in vape (I'm a horrifying savage beast I smoked it, I know that makes me a bad person). Effects are great pretty much what the box says relaxed, happy, euphoric, uplifted, and sleepy. I might put happy in front of relaxed, but that's probably because I just smoked some brownie scout.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rise is a huge offender in this area. I'm western pa guy and happen to live right between two of the rise dispensaries (new castle 10 mins south hermitage 15 mins north). They ALWAYS have different prices on the same stuff, just yesterday for instance $55 gram of cresco rocket fuel wax in new castle. In hermitage, that very same gram, that dropped the very same day, is $65. I've never actually been to the hermitage one because they've always been more expensive. And while we're talking prices I made the HUGE mistake of checking out [cannasaver.com](https://cannasaver.com). I would bet there are situations where you could fly to CO to buy weed, and the weed PLUS flight would be less than your pa dispo bill for the same quantity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah you can. Flight out of PIT 333.80. Found a deal for 8 grams of wax 100 bucks otd. So flight + 8 grams wax = 433.80 8 grams of the cheapest wax I've seen in PA \* 55 = 440 Full disclosure I didn't even pick the cheapest flight (there was a spirit flight for a list price of 219).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First things first Indica, Sativa, Hybrid: Indica strains are believed to be physically sedating, perfect for relaxing with a movie or as a nightcap before bed. Sativas are said to provide invigorating, uplifting cerebral effects that pair well with physical activity, social gatherings, and creative projects. Hybrids are thought to fall somewhere in between, offering a balance of indica and sativa effects. If you're here for anxiety, I'd reccomend starting with an indica to get yourself used to the effects. Also if you're nervous about trying cannabis anything with a 1:1 thc/cbd ratio could be a good starting point also because the cbd will tone down the psychoactive effects of the thc. Second Things Second Product categories: * Flower - Obviously flower form of cannabis can be smoked, but PA would prefer that you vaporize it. * Concentrates (Sugar, Wax, Diamonds, Sauce, Live Resin, whatever tf else they come up with) Some are dry and easy to work with some are sticky AF and not easy to work with. Typically Consumed with a dab pen or dab rig. See youtube for further instructions, people love to record themselves dabbing so there is not shortage of options there. * Not really for newbies I wouldn't suggest starting with concentrates. * Vape Cartridges Screw it onto a battery and away you go. * Disposables smaller version of above vape cartridge with permanently affixed battery. Bad for the environment, bad for your wallet (they're over priced), but good for people who don't want to spend a ton to try a few different things. * Edibles - capsules, rso, tinctures * Topicals - Lotions</TEXT>

So flight + 8 grams wax = 433.80 8 grams of the cheapest wax I've seen in PA \* 55 = 440 OR 16 half grams of frx concentrate \* 58 = 928 (lolloolloollllooolol I'll never buy anything from frx. Ever.

My guess is that demand for this strain is high just because it looks so DAMN PRETTY and there just isn't enough to fill orders for all dispos. Ask your local dispo to order it, esp if they carry other GTI flower.</TEXT>

Rythm tends to be 3.5 on the dot with flower, terrapin most always 3.6, liberty (only one cut) 3.7 Salmon River OG :), prime has been heavy for me 3.6 avg. For concentrates keep old packaging from like brands and use the empties to tare the containers off. ANY TIME ANYTHING IS OFF complain respectfully, and they'll take care of you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I hit this on a clear head this morning and I'm a little underwhelmed. First hit taste is great very strain representative. The smell is pretty herby for a vape cart and I'll be taking calypso cosmo with me later today for this reason. Effects for me are light head buzz with a lighter body buzz and overall i'd say the effects are too mild for a $75 carty. The milder effects of this might be good for anxiety during the day as I'm not feeling this is gonna knock me out even though it's an indica strain. Also full disclosure vape carts are probably my least favorite consumption method. This was the first farm rx product I tried, and it'll probably be the last until such a time when their prices return to planet earth (also looks kind of under filled).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>During this crisis there is another path we can take from a pricing standpoint. The pa attorney generals office is investigating all reports of price gouging during the crisis. This probably won't apply to every dispensary, but if you see a product at one dispo going for higher than another dispo report them to the attorney general. I actually have an example. I watch three dispensaries that are on my travel routes. Piece of shit herbology brookville was selling prim sugar wax for 80/g which we all know goes for 60 else where that's a price gouge and I'm pissed at myself for not thinking about reporting it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don't really want the state regulating prices that well and truly would fuck things up. What we need is CANNABIS OFF SCHEDULE 1. Nothing is seriously changing from a price standpoint until we can ship it across state lines. You have to vote, and voting for republicans isn't gonna cut it. The prices do suck, I know that, and I'm with you guys. My suggestion on pricing is to send the PA Atty General after any dispensary charging fucked up prices during this crisis. For example Herbology brookville was charging 80 for some prime sugar wax we all know costs 60 everywhere else. Please report any gouging you see here [pricegouging@attorneygeneral.gov](mailto:pricegouging@attorneygeneral.gov).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like the different dispos may have contracts with certain growers. I never see grassroots at Rise (GTI/Rythm), but Herbology (grassroots) does seem to carry Rythm products. I believe solevo tends to hold back some of their stock so they have at least something to offer everyday in each category. And I'm sure employees probably get first crack at stuff that comes in, but I doubt that really impacts overall supply much. I do beleive that dispos are responsible for setting the prices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, for the sake of argument, we'll throw out cannasaver and look at one dispensary in CO which will make this comparison more apples to apples. [https://www.terrapincarestation.com/terrapin-manhattan-menu/](https://www.terrapincarestation.com/terrapin-manhattan-menu/) Terrapin sells the same strains in PA. Minimum ounce cost in PA for cherry diesel (35 dollar 8's from solevo) 280/oz. Terrapin manhattan (denver) 120/Oz (med menu). Seems cheaper to me. Terrapin concentrates selling for 19.95 in that store 55 here in pa. Again seems a little cheaper to me.</TEXT>

So rechecked the menu and there were 4 different prime flowers in grams, that weren't Purp Haze 44. So i just ordered all 4 they totaled out to 7 bucks more than the star tribe. The kicker is I've opened 3 of the grams Butter Cookies 16, Pt StarDawg, and this today. Every one of them was 1.2. I haven't opened the purp haze 44 8thOR the purp haze 19 gram yet, but if the last gram hits the scale at 1.2 that's 4.8 for 67 bucks and not too shabby.</TEXT>

Last five 8ths haven't been all that great (2 cherry d, moonshine haze, hash haze, long's peak, sour tangie). Hay smells, tiwggy buds, harsh burny taste, and black ash from all those strains.

    <TEXT>In my experience I have been able to waive the initial dispensary consult at every dispensary I've been too (Rise, Solevo, Herbology), with no questions or dirty looks or sideways glances. There isn't really any browsing that can be done all the product is completely sealed. If you have any experience just order what you think you might like from the menu and go for it. If you're here for anxiety I'd suggest indica's or hybrid strains. I am an axiety patient also and some strains that work well for me are: Rythm - Do Si Dos, Gelato, Brownie Scout, Pyromancy, Plum Crazy. Prime - Chem De La Chem, Butter Cookies, PT Stardawg. Terrapin: Ice Cream Cake, Cherry Diesel, Coffee Ice cream. Grassroots - Birthday Cake</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My gram of this flower just weighed in at 1.4 :). I love this and did something similar about a month ago. I took some sauce I accidentally dropped on the counter and mopped it all up with a small bud of la biker. I then basically rolled that little biker in keif and stuck it in an empty terrapin concentrate container to dry (I let it sit awhile, but it would have been good to go after a day or two).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure about that changing anytime soon, but your best bet is to buy RSO or distillate syringes and use those to make edibles. There are a bunch of folks on here who make RSO chocolates or gummies. Also I saw a smootie yesterday. So while store bought edibles are convenient your imagination is your only limit on what you can do with RSO or distillate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably some kind of concentrate pen. You'll get the best recommendation in r/Waxpen. In my opinion trying to vape flower discreetly is pretty futile. I doubt there is a flower vape that conceals the smell of some nice pa medical to where you'd be comfortable having it around loaded and ready, plus they all smell like weed when you use em. Then there are overpriced cartridges to consider I honestly kind of hate them though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First impressions: * Smell Awesome. My wife came downstairs and said "Oh you're what I'm smelling" * Side note rythm's black jars do have a poo smell. Scooped this and moonrise today so we're talking black jars 4 and 5. Previously, I thought the poo smell was related to the cookies genetics that were in the other containers (gelato, do si do's...), but no cookies genetics this time still poopy. * Taste very nice pretty kushy, little grassy. I've been on primes purple haze both phenos and some shitty bubba kush from calypso for the last 5-6 days. I took a hit and said "this is what I should be smoking." * Effects novices should probably tread lightly awesome body buzz and very calming overall. My tolerance is pretty high and this feels nice. * Overall rating: 10/10 - 2 for the poop jar (because it has to be affecting flavor and smell somewhat) so 8/10.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 8th weighed 3.6, PA growers seem to be figuring out how to use their scales. This is the second time I've had this strain from liberty. I liked it quite a bit the first time, but I scooped it on the way to camp and had to much fun to do a proper shoot and tell. * Second go round: Does. Not. Disappoint. * The smell is great, just straight lemony awesome. Opinions are like assholes and everyone has one, and my opinion is that this is one of the better (top 3) smelling strains I've had from the program. * Taste: Limonene scrapes by as the top terp and it shows a bit. Pretty bright flavor, no burny not quite properly dried or flushed bullshit taste. * Effects: This one is a strong buy IMHO (remember they're like assholes). The effects are great very indica and noticeable. * Overall 10/10 - 1 the whole 8th looks a bit small. +1 Dense nugs that taste great and don't come in a poop jar are awesome. 10/10 for 50 bucks at rise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These are both buds from prime's last flower drop. I was lucky enough to get an 8th of #44 (cotton candy) and a gram of #19 (choc lemon drop). I've been wanting to snap them side by side and ended up doing so while talking to a buddy this evening. The picture came out so well on the first try I couldn't not post it for you all. Mini review so as to provide some value beyond pretty pictures. Cotton candy smells like cotton candy to me, my wife (the cotton candy enthusiast) thought it smelled like hops. She doesn't know what she's talking about in this case. Choc Lemon didn't smell like much but did smoke nice. They're both purple haze and smoke like hybrids to me, not sedating or racy, but nice. Rating for me probably 7-8/10 on the 44 and 6-7/10 on the 19.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some other folks may know better, but the major difference I see in the various concentrates is how hard or easy they are to work with. I prefer dryer concentrates wax, sugar wax, and budder are the three types I've tried so far. I've also tried cured sugar from rythm which was like trying to work with super glue, and from as ease of use standpoint that sucked. As far as smell it's probably going to be pretty variable from concentrate to concentrate based on terpene profile mostly. I'd be willing to bet that pure thca diamonds with a low terp profile probably just smell vaguely weedy like a cart. But even the higher terp profile concentrates that may smell more herby still really don't smell like weed proper PLUS you're vaping with that pen not combusting which would also reduce the odor and limit it's ability to hang around. Edit anecdotal evidence: I had some ice cream cake wax in a pen. I was hitting it standing on the side of the street in downtown pittsburgh at 930 am during the week so people were around. Not one person seemed to look at me or care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ultimately I'd say it's worth it for the legal protection alone. You can always grab two or three cuts from the dispo and then re-use those jars with the labels attached to store your black market cannabis, there you get legal protection and cheaper product. With that said I haven't gone back to the black market since I got my card in spite of being annoyed by prices because ordering off a menu and having the convenience of grabbing whatever whenever I desire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Friday morning I put in an order at herbology brookville. I set my pickup time from 515-545 pm since I knew I'd be driving right by around that time of day. I was about 4 minutes out at 514 pm when I got a text message saying my order was cancelled, which was odd because it had been prepared and confirmed for hours. So I called right away and asked what the deal was, the lady briefly puts me on hold, then comes back and says "they're getting ready to do inventory, your stuff is still here in the bag." I said ok I'll be there in five minutes (got a gram of legend of 91 from prime for 9 bucks using rewards). So they cancelled my order BEFORE my pickup window because they were doing inventory?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do this on the regular. And i'll tell what concentrates have worked well ontop of flower or keif. Typically what I do is this: After my bowl has some ash in it I'll kind of compress the ash a bit and put a scoop of kief right on top of it. Then I'll take a bit of some concentrate and put that right on top of the kief. Next fire away being careful to flame the keif without hitting the concentrate, the kief will burn and basically burn up the concentrates. MUST BE DONE IN ONE HIT TO AVOID WASTING CONCENTRATE. What works: Badder, Budder, cresco live sugar, prime sugar wax, terrapin waxes and probably sugars (never had terrapin sugar), What doesn't: SAUCE (just stay away), rythm cured sugar (more like sauce and diamonds) What I don't know about: Live Resin, some of them look like they'd work some look like they wouldn't.</TEXT>

Good luck! This. Sometimes I heart Jane just sucks.

    <TEXT>**In pa state parks be aware of your surroundings. And follow park rules ESP the quiet hours rule.** Years ago camping with friends at cooks forest state park there were 6-7 of us set up on a two sites right across from a family in a pop up camper. Everything was fine until WE violated quiet hours which triggered a mini shit storm. From the camp site I could see the vehicle entrance to the camp site area, and shortly after 10 I noticed a rangers vehicle come through the gate faster than would be normal for a routine patrol. I said hey guys I'm pretty sure he's on his way over here and thankfully he had to make a big loop before arriving at our camp site. I grabbed my weed and non chalantly stashed it back under some brush in the shadows before the ranger arrived. So we're good on weed at this point, my shit is hidden and ranger rick never knew; However, he was highly annoyed that we were **drinking (everyone was legal** ***but booze in state parks IS NOT*** **)** and **very highly annoyed that we'd disturbed the family across the way.** All of our booze was confiscated (except for a smartwater bottle filled with vodka) and we got yelled at for awhile about breaking the rules and threatened with fines, but since we were polite we got off with a warning and the confiscation our of booze.  #8203; The rangers are generally pretty lax as long as you're respectful of others and mindful of the rules. Be discreet about alcohol and weed consumption and you'll have zero problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NOPE, Because as esteban said he's had some that's he's been disappointed with. I'm pretty sure I saw some hermed farmrx on here at one point, and at not way is it worth the risk to spend that money on a grower that EVER let's hermed bud out the door. I bought one farmrx cart, it was the only program cart I've had that clogged regularly. There is no way that cart was any better than the ICC cart i had from terrapin (or any other cart I've had) the 45 dollar terrapin cart never clogged. That cart was probably one of the worst ways I've ever spent 75 bucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With a cold start my method is as follows: 1. Load Dab (try to center it in the banger) 2. Place carb cap atop banger 3. Fire torch and heat sides first (I'm applying heat to the bottom half of the banger) the reason for heating the sides first is that the oil will climb the cooler banger walls if you start from the center. 4. Once the dab in the center starts melting start heating the bottom, I usually kind of circle around the concentrate in the center. 5. When the concentrate starts bubbling it's ready kill the torch and hit that bad boy. I never use a timer I purely go by the look of the concentrate. Definitely check some youtube vids of people doing them them. And one last thing to mention is that cold starts do waste a little more material.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was once after and 8th of something from prime, but they ran out before I got there. They did have 4 different grams though so I said fuck it and bought a gram of each of the 4. The 8 would have been 58 bucks. I paid 72 for the 4 grams, but ended up with 4.8 for 72. The unit price might actually be lower on grams if they're over weight. I applied the same logic and bought 6 terrapin grams for 78 total and got 6.6. The most interesting thing about the terrapin purchase is that two 8's would have been 91 bucks (42 cherry d and 49 ICC). It's kind of fucked honestly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really think this is a non issue. Attitudes in general toward cannabis are shifting more rapidly now than at any point in our countries history. I truly believe that some kind of federal legislation is right around the corner, and when that happens the i heart jane data becomes even more yawn worthy. What's slowing us down the most is probably old people. By and large people of Trump and Bidens generation heard much different messages on cannabis than we're hearing now. If you think about it their parents would have been reading newspapers when Anslinger was dropping quotes like this:  #8220;There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others. #8221; \~Harry J. Anslinger (Native Pennsylvanian, Racist, Asshole, Republican). We need to vote wisely, and vote younger where possible it's time to let these boomer assholes retire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you can always blame the dispensary or the employees, cannabis attracts some serious space cadet clientele. My local rise is awesome they move people through at a pretty good pace. Herbology brookville on the other hand is a different story. I've had efficient visits, but on multiple occasions my experience has been: 3 or 4 employees in the waiting room with one person working the back counter. I'm next in line and some space cadet asshole is back there gabbing away at the counter employee for, I SHIT YOU NOT, 10 to 15 minutes. Once the girl left half her money in the car then had to go back and "look for it." Not having all your shit together at the dispo isn't cool, it's not a fucking tj maxx, I can't go in and grab what I want off the rack while you spend 15 minutes doing elementary school math in your head. If the girl who left half her money in the car is reading this: Fuck you, get your shit together and stop doing whatever upper you were on that day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All three strains are all really decent. The citrus sap is my least favorite of these 3 as there was some variance to the bud structure in the jar, some really loose buds that didn't smoke all that well and some tighter buds that did smoke well. Both Ileras and nicely cured and both would be worth it at 80-90 a qtr.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what the solution is but all of these dispensaries need to get significantly more efficient. If you weren't standing in line for 45 minutes there wouldn't be any smoking, and there'd be no reason for people to pull their masks down because they're chatting and tired of wearing them. 1. How about a drive through windows or express lane, where your shit is already stickered, there's no talking, no adds to your order, no nothing but trade cash for meds and drive away. 2. We as patients can be better organized and help this situation out too. Don't leave your cash in your car, make sure you have an online order and your ID'S, avoid drawn out conversations with the staff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is the contact link for his office: [https://www.senatoreldervogel.com/contact-me/](https://www.senatoreldervogel.com/contact-me/)  #8203; I'm sending this over right now: Senator Vogel, now is the time to bring SB350 to a vote. Other states are seeing significant positive impact from legalized recreational cannabis, and Pennsylvania is about to be left behind. With New Jersey moving on legalization we're going to see plenty of new jersey cannabis making it's way into the Philadelphia area, and the entire state of pa, and all of those legal New Jersey sales are lost tax revenue for the state of PA. I believe your doing quality work for our county, but if PA can't bring itself to rethink this issue you'll not be getting my vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The sheriffs office cannot see that you have a medical card unless you show them your card. So provided you qualify for concealed carry in your area, you would likely get the permit, if you applied (and lie about the drug use question). If you're looking to stay strictly by the book, you should get rid of your firearms because as a "recreational" medical user owning guns and having weed is a federal no-no. But since you already have guns, and likely lied on the federal purchase form when you bought them, it might be better to just apply for the medical cannabis card so you can claim medical use if you run into trouble. If you live in butler, beaver or lawrence counties contact senator elder vogel and tell him to allow sb350 for a vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well honestly to me it seriously effects the taste and smell of the bud. Cannabis that isn't partly hermed will taste better, smell better, and have better effects. Think of it like this: You can go grab a keystone ice and a southern tier nu juice they'll both give you pretty equal effects but one is undeniably better. What pisses people off is paying keystone prices for southern tier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Do you find herm holes produce a subtle off flavor like something went wrong in a brewing process that is undesired, or is it more offensive like the beer skunked? In my opinion it can be both depending on how bad the bud is. The holes themselves aren't really the problem, they're only empty voids. The problem is the part of the plant surrounds the hole is like a little seed husk and they don't taste very good (esp when smoked). The other problem with the little seed husks is that the process of seed creation is pretty energy expensive for the plant. When that starts to happen the plant stops producing all the stuff we like and starts to attempt to self propagate like a raptor from jurrasic park. Is there still good stuff in there when they whack these plants down, sure, but every bud with a hole in it is a bud that could have been better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My thought process when picking flower has transformed a little bit since joining the program. At first I was just looking at THC mostly, and we all know that a stressed hermed plant can test high for THC, but I was getting a lot of stressed 8th's. So I started looking for higher percentage of terpenes as a quality indicator and it's been serving me pretty well. I agree with you on indica vs sativa, and we should probably just all stop using those labels now as there are very few if any pure sativa or indica strains out there.</TEXT>

Nah I'm not worried about this cresco 30% specifically, I was having a day dream moment about interstate commerce after seeing a menu from OR.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You buy a 1g tube of RSO, does that RSO (proudct only) actually weigh 1 gram? The syringes are labeled in ml's at least the ones I've seen which can't be directly converted to grams without density. My reason for posing this question is this: it makes the dosing math strange how do you get from ml's to mg's per ml without density? And then are the thc and terp percentages based on weight (g's) or volume (ml's)?</TEXT>

Rise is far too cool for quarters so they round that .50 down for you so no one has to touch any lowly coins. Just ran some of the sauce through my e-rig and it's very incensey and the taste is lingering, though that could be due to me licking the dab tool. So yeah they must flash sale stuff that's about to expire though it's worth noting that it wasn't listed as old or on sale. I didn't use any reward points for a total of 104.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think what happens is that the new places are allowed to stock up before they open AND/OR other dispensaries in the same chain divert some of their ordering capacity to their new locations. For instance I live near two rise's (how that happened I don't know) and they are both pretty consistently stocked except for about the last month or so right before their new location opens in monroeville. So are hermitage and new castle buying less or diverting some of their purchase power to get the monroeville location stocked?</TEXT>
