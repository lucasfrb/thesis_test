If Riley truly turned when Ellie was there, she would have attacked Ellie, like Sam did. Did Ellie have to kill her? I feel like there #8217;s a story there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What was it like for Ellie, living at Tommy and Maria's place?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-28 22:37:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tommy says there are 20 families there. Ellie has never experienced what it's like to have a family. She has some people she's close with but she told Joel that everyone she "has ever cared for has either died or left" her. In Left Behind she tells Riley that she doesn't really hang out with anyone. When Riley suggests some names Ellie dismissively says "they're your friends". Do you think she would have settled into life at Tommy's, with all those happy families around her? Even Joel isn't really fully there for her as he has his brother. Ellie might feel quite alone and isolated. Maybe the families are mistrustful of her too. She's got this massive bite but hasn't turned. Maybe they're wary of getting too close. They could worry she's a carrier, even if not technically infected herself. Seeing all those families around her, all that love shared between people, it must be hard for her. TLOU PTII might be about her quest to avenge her mother... the only family she has ever known of. She's gonna find and kill every last Firefly. The group that stole her mother from her. If she believes Joel's lie then she basically believes that the Fireflies' cause is pointless. Her mother died for nothing. I can't wait to find out. What do you folks think? Edit: clarity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does that seem like dumb logic to you? He killed one of them and stole his key. So they #8217;re gonna be pissed with Henry and have a motive to hunt him down. And he #8217;s decided to stay in a pretty cosy hideout that they couldn #8217;t possibly access because they don #8217;t have a key to the flimsy door. The only advantage he has is if they don #8217;t know about the hideout. But if they do... he #8217;s being very optimistic about the defense of one wooden door.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The bus driver and the quarry</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-06 21:09:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Two of my favourite pieces of evidence that, in my view, significantly undermine the State's case. The bus driver says she saw TH taking photos between 3:30pm and 3:40pm. Bobby Dassey says she was taking photos and then approached SA's trailer at 2:45pm. They can't both be telling the truth. Clearly, the bus driver is an impeccable witness in this regard as she arrives at the property at the same time each day, having collected the children from school. So we must conclude that Bobby Dassey's timeline is incorrect. I would speculate that he deliberately lied. He did not see TH but lied about seeing her to bolster the case against SA. He gave a time when asked to without knowing that, as luck would have it, an impartial witness could contradict him. The bones. The bones were clearly moved as they appear in two sites - SA's burn pit and the quarry. The majority were in the burn pit with some remaining in the quarry. There were also some left in the burn barrel. The reasonable hypothesis here is that the bones were moved between the burn pit and quarry locations using the burn barrel. The question is - in which direction were they moved? From the burn pit to the quarry or from the quarry to the burn pit. The next question is - why would Steven Avery burn her body at the quarry only to dump her bones in his own burn pit outside his own trailer? He's taken her all the way to the quarry only to bring the majority of the bones back? It is much more plausible to say that she was burned at the quarry and then her bones were moved to the burn pit. Clearly by somebody quite careless as they didn't think to clean out the burn barrel afterwards.</TEXT>

Another side of me trusts them to know what I'll want better than I know it myself. I love you Naughty Dog!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New theory on original reveal trailer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-12 16:41:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>The general feeling has been that Ellie killed all those people. I have a new idea. What if those people are Ellie's friends? She and Joel were off somewhere else and came back to find that massacre. As they survey what has happened and try to take it in, Ellie resolves to kill every last one of the people responsible. Perhaps the settlement is part of Tommy's community by the dam? It would fit with Neil's [recent blog post](https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_ii_gameplay_revealed) where he says:  gt;*"Ellie is now 19 and has found a semblance of peace and normality living in Jackson. She #8217;s had a chance to be a teenager and forge lasting relationships. When that peace is disrupted by a violent act, Ellie is thrust into a brutal journey of retribution..."* It would also fit better with her general demeanour during that first trailer. It's never felt quite right to me that she would butcher all those people then calmly pull out her guitar and start singing. Her hands are trembling \- maybe because she is in shock about what happened. In the new gameplay trailer, during the actual gameplay we see her wearing the bracelet that Dina was wearing during the cinematic. Perhaps she took it off Dina's lifeless body before embarking on her quest for vengeance. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this is a hot issue and I am genuinely asking in good faith, not to start an argument or stir the pot. I see it happening more lately: Dr Who is now played by a woman. Rumours that James Bond will be played by a black man. On a related note, Hermione Granger is played by a black woman in the stage show. My question is: why is this considered virtuous? If society wants minority groups represented better in pop culture, wouldn #8217;t it be better to create new interesting characters, rather than replacing existing ones? I have never considered James Bond #8217;s skin colour to be an especially important part of his character. He #8217;s just...Bond. But making him black suddenly turns the franchise into something more political (not sure if that #8217;s the right word but you know what I mean?).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It seems the old world is falling</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-17 00:56:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>It seems to me that the world is passing through a period of rapid change. Old norms and institutions are being cast aside at breakneck speed, with no sign of abating. You only need to look back a few decades to see a Western society that is almost unrecognisable today. Traditional values such as the family and religion are fading. Women are no longer deferential to men. Even deep-seated norms like gender can no longer be counted upon. Celebrity has become cheap. The explosion of information via the internet has caused trust in political institutions to evaporate. The obsession is with individuality but people seem more insecure than ever. The world is so loud, with everybody fighting for everybody else #8217;s attention. People present their perfect lives on social media and yet loneliness is at epidemic levels. Sexuality has transformed. No longer are people inhibited. Porn is available to all, and much of it depicts sexual practices that would seem alien to those living only a few decades ago. It seems to me that the human race is more connected than ever. There is so much information available and that is a deeply destabilising thing. The rulers of the world, who used to make decisions in smoky back rooms are suddenly finding themselves scrutinised just like anybody else. Where does society go from here? Where do the chips fall? I feel like everything is up in the air and is not even close to settling on the table yet.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-02-01 22:23:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Suddenly everyone defines themselves by one of their physical or mental characteristics. We #8217;re not all simply  #8220;people #8221; anymore, not simply members of a single human family trying to find the best way to rub along together on this giant rock. Instead we are all members of tribes, whose memberships are decided based upon which disadvantaged group you belong to. You want to be an engineer? You think you #8217;ve got some talent and want to pursue that course? Well guess what, because you are black/gay/female/trans, you are much less likely to succeed than a straight white man! And don #8217;t forget it! You are part of an underprivileged group and you can forget any hope of being treated as an equal and succeeding on your merits! If you keep telling people that they can #8217;t succeed or that it will be hard for them, you only discourage them from even trying. We keep forcing people into these tribes, forcing them to see more  #8220;privileged #8221; groups as their enemy. Trying to shame more successful people into giving opportunities not based on ability alone. It is perverse. I have never met a single person who would deny a job to somebody because of their gender or skin colour. Employers want to hire the best people! You think employers want to hire a second rate candidate when there is somebody else with a vagina who could do it better? Total nonsense. I am sick of seeing everyone having a massive circle jerk every time someone becomes the first gay person to be appointed into some position. Nobody gives a fuck that you #8217;re gay or whatever. Nobody. You (hopefully) were given the job because you were the best candidate. That is all that matters, and all that has and will ever matter. Whatever social category you place yourself in is fucking boring and irrelevant. Now, I get that society is unequal and some people have to work harder than others. That problem needs fixing. But they way to fix it is NOT to force society into all these tribes, competing against each other. It is to recognise than we are ONE group and remove the obstacles that prevent anyone going as far as their talents will take them. And isn #8217;t it a great irony that these groups think it #8217;s perfectly OK to discuss how shitty straight white men are! They are fucking terrible! It #8217;s all their fault! Fuck them! And guess what - that #8217;s not racist or sexist because the rules say straight white men cant be victims of sexism or racism! It is so fucking hypocritical and just makes me think society has lost its god damn mind. EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH EQUAL DIGNITY AND RESPECT. And guess what - that includes straight white men. Until the leaders of this movement can get that simple fact into their thick skulls and stop driving society apart with tribalism we will never move society to a good place. I can #8217;t believe this opinion is even unpopular but hey it #8217;s 2019 so it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear these singers declaring how their are  #8220;artists #8221; but I find this very problematic. Singing a song that was written by another person is not a true form of artistic expression in the same way as a composer or a painter is an artist. The term artist suggests a degree of talent and skill that just isn #8217;t there. Some singers don #8217;t do this - I #8217;ve heard the likes of Shirley Bassey describe herself as a performer. She is an excellent performer, but a performer nevertheless. You want to be an artist? Great. How about you study the likes of Norah Jones, Oasis and others who actually write and perform their own material. That is true artistry. Here #8217;s an analogy for fun: a singer who doesn #8217;t write their own songs is like a painter who uses painting-by-numbers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Delete SOME played episodes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-01 12:11:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there podcast fans. I ha e a query that has been bugging me for a long while. Generally speaking I want my podcast app to delete an episode once I have played it. For some podcasts I want to keep all episodes even after I #8217;ve played them. That #8217;s all fine and I have done the tweaked the settings for each show accordingly. My problem is that there are certain podcasts where I generally want each played episode to be deleted but I want some episodes to be kept. For example, I listen to the NYT The Daily. I want each episode to delete once played but there was an episode a while ago on the Facebook scandal and I want that episode kept (ie not deleted, even once listened to). So my question is: is there a podcast app that will let me  #8216;flag #8217; certain episodes that will not be deleted even though the settings for that show are to delete once played? Thank you!</TEXT>

The Apple apps are currently split across two categories for some reason I don #8217;t understand.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Video games as a medium for storytelling</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-17 09:46:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello I love The Last of Us. During my first playthrough I wasn #8217;t immediately hooked but once I got past the bloater in the school I became basically addicted. I have played it millions of times and love to just explore the world nowadays. I think we are just scratching the surface of games as a medium for telling a story. There is an additional element that will never be present in books or movies  #8212; you *are* the character. You aren #8217;t being told of their adventures, you control them. You *become* them. I find this to be an incredibly powerful way to get the player to invest in the character. Of course, most video games are more focused on excitement to keep the player interested but I think TLOU has really shown how a focus on storytelling and emotion is every bit as powerful a way to make games popular and enduring. I think RDR2 owes a lot to TLOU. I cared so much for Arthur, the game had made me care more than I realised. I don #8217;t really have anything else to add, other than I can #8217;t wait to see what Naughty Dog and others do now that it #8217;s clear to everybody that games can give players powerful, emotional experiences (IMO) greater than those from books and movies.

    <TEXT>I propose they call themselves Enlighten and use the slogan  #8216;Evidence-based Politics for Modern Britain #8217;. My thinking is that TIG have talked about their desire to transform how politics is done so it is less  #8220;old-fashioned #8221; , and values ideas that work over tribalism. The Enlightenment was a period of history where the human race became aware of science and how to understand the world as it truly is. It was a step forward, a giant leap forward, in how we understood ourselves and the world around us. A word like Enlighten evokes this era of rationality, and also brings to mind the idea of a light in the darkness to guide the way in uncertain surroundings. CUK are a solitary beacon of hope for those who know Britain needs to modernise its politics. The name Enlighten says that. Furthermore, it is an unconventional name in the sense that it doesn #8217;t reference a traditional political position e.g. conservative, liberal, democrat, independence, etc. It is more poetic and speaks to us all on a human level. Their logo should be a lit candle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It gets a lot of hate. But I like it because it captures the majesty of the old republic. There is so much beautiful architecture, and the space ships look so elegant. I also enjoy the political side of it. It is interesting to see the manoeuvring of various interests, trying to achieve their power ambitions. And it has a wonderful ominous sense, as we all know what #8217;s coming. Sure, the script seems weak in places, but that is a minor problem. The language and grammar has that lovely George Lucas signature, that connects them with the OT. Some of the characters are really cool too. I love Mace Windu, Amidala, Qui Gon, Darth Maul, and a lot of others. EDIT: and the space opera used in the scene with Palpatine and Anakin is beautiful! Another example of the beauty that GL brought to his universe.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have a theory about the plot</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-12 07:58:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Joel becomes infected and Ellie has to kill him. Here #8217;s my evidence: I watched a YouTube video recently where Neil gave a presentation about his career leading up to The Last Of Us. Here #8217;s a link: https://youtu.be/RjwuPeqZt0s In this video he talks about how he #8217;s had the idea for a story that follows a man and a girl for a while. He never found the right way of using it before TLOU. He seems to hang on to ideas he likes until he finds a good way to express them. Anyway, in one of these stories the girl kills the man because he gets sick (or something...can #8217;t remember exactly what was wrong with him). This is clearly quite an emotional moment in any story (see Of Mice and Men), so I think Neil would want to use it somewhere. He has talked before about how TLOU could be seen as Ellie #8217;s origin story, and we know how emotional P2 is going to be. Ashley Johnson was in tears when Neil first told her the plot. We know that it focuses on hate, as a contrast to the first one, which was about love. I don #8217;t believe that the moral of the story will be how hate is a good thing. I think Ellie #8217;s hatred will lead her to some bad places - there will be a cost to her. It makes sense to me that the cost will be Joel becoming infected and her needing to kill him. I recommend watching the YouTube video in full as it #8217;s pretty interesting and may lead you to come up with other ideas!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Carpool Karaoke isn #8217;t good any more</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-21 18:47:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>It used to be. When it was about seeing a world famous celebrity doing something we all do  #8212; singing along to their songs in a car, it was great. Corden did such a good job with it, and his semi-interviews about their career were great. It just made them seem so...normal, which made it thrilling. This latest one with Celine Dion makes me think the producers have forgotten what made it good. It has become more about being over the top and showbiz. The ending, singing MHWGO on the ship was ludicrous, and was nothing to do with Car Pool Karaoke. They need to strip it back again, and make them like them used to. Like the one with Adele, where it was just two mates chatting, singing along to Adele songs. Brilliant, and highly watchable. These days, they are just appealing to the click bait generation by making it over the top and sensational, lots of bangs and whistles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Trying to track down an episode where JJ tells a story about a murdered fashion student</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-04 18:59:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can #8217;t remember the preceding case much, but I think it involved a teenage girl and an assault. As the case drew to a close, JJ told a story about a young girl named Marisol who was a fashion student. Basically she was senselessly stabbed to death by the ringleader of a girl gang who wanted her earrings. The stabber was convicted of murder and JJ explained how she was responsible for dealing with the accomplices who #8217;d been with the killer, offering encouragement etc. She convicted all of them of murder because she reasoned that the support of the gang was essential for the one girl to actually commit the murder. The acted as a pack, surrounding Marisol and holding her down. JJ said they were all culpable for the murder, regardless of who actually did the deed. The conviction was held up on appeal, too. The purpose of the story was to teach the defendant in the case a lesson - just because she didn #8217;t actually do whatever it was, doesn #8217;t mean she isn #8217;t culpable for it having been carried out. Does anyone know the episode??? The case was on YouTube years ago but long since removed!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-12 19:48:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been playing different sections of Part I and watching the Part II trailers and interviews again and just had a few ideas I thought I #8217;d throw out there. I #8217;m sure some of this stuff has already been said but there we are. The gameplay trailer shows two timelines. Ellie all happy with her friends at the party, and Ellie rampaging through the Seraphites. I wonder how big the game will go on this  #8216;two timelines #8217; thing. Maybe it will be like Left Behind, where you literally flip back and forth between two times. I think the reveal trailer is at Tommy #8217;s Dam. The trees are very similar to those you see at the end of Part I. I think the Seraphites probably turned up and started butchering the people there and Ellie survived (maybe others too). I think Dina died, hence why Ellie is wearing her bracelet in the gameplay trailer. I dunno what the deal with Joel is but I don #8217;t think Ellie is feeling very warm towards him. She probably resents him for preventing her from curing the infection. Every time she sees something bad she is reminded that they almost had a vaccine. The Mystery Woman is a mystery. I #8217;m still liking the theory that it #8217;s Anna, Ellie #8217;s mother but I #8217;m not sure the timeframe works. The Seraphites are clearly around and doing their thing when we see MW and they don #8217;t seem much different when Ellie sees them. Is it really feasible that they were fully established a few years after the outbreak to see Ellie #8217;s mother, and then remained unchanged 19 years later when Ellie runs into them? I #8217;m not sure. Anyway, thanks for reading. Tell me what you think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You may have noticed that the Collecter #8217;s and Ellie editions of the game will include a thank you letter from Neil Druckmann. I #8217;ve zoomed in on the images. Here is the text:  #8220;What would you do if someone you loved was the victim of a cruel and violent act? How easily could one #8217;s mind tip toward violent retribution? How far would you go to bring the ones responsible to justice? If you were successful, how would it change you? Would you ever be the same? With The Last of Us Part II we set out to create an experience that explores these difficult questions, the darkest sides of human nature, and the vicious cycles of violence that we witness in the world around us on a daily basis. The result is a game crafted by hundreds of developers that pushed themselves to create something more than mere entertainment - a game that we #8217;re incredibly proud of and that we hope will enthral you and challenge your own views of justice and empathy. On behalf of everyone at Naughty Dog, we want to thank you for embarking on this journey with us. Neil Druckmann | Director, The Last of Us Part II #8221;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Game Director Anthony Newman sets expectations</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-26 18:25:34</DATE>
    <TEXT> #8220;The thing I really want people to understand about this game is that  #8212; as high as the expectations are for the sequel to such a highly-regarded game, I think that we #8217;re going to go beyond those expectations. #8221; Anticipation for TLOUII has been at fever pitch and I think it #8217;s so exciting to see Naughty Dog aren #8217;t trying to dampen that down at all. As high as our expectations are for this, they #8217;re going all out and saying they #8217;re going to surpass them! It #8217;s so unusual from a PR perspective and makes me love Naughty Dog even more. I can not wait for this.

    <TEXT>Just to speak on the other side of this for a moment, the section that the BBC found objectionable was when she said that Trump #8217;s motive in making those racist comments was  #8220;to get attention #8221; and when she responded  #8220;Yes #8221; when her co-presenter asked her whether Trump #8217;s use of racist language legitimises it for other people. Now, I must say, I think her co-presenter deserves some of the blame here. He shouldn #8217;t have asked her the question as any answer she gave would have been a breach. The BBC found no problem at all with her recounting her own experiences of racism, nor with her describing Trump #8217;s comments as racist. We have to be clear on that - the BBC is not suggesting she was wrong to say he was being racist. I feel bad for her really because it was such an unusual situation. You don #8217;t expect to be covering a story where the US President has been overtly racist. But them #8217;s the rules and I guess if we don #8217;t like them we should change them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does anyone play PC games?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-04 15:38:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m talking about console games that have a PC version. I can #8217;t imagine why it #8217;s better. Do you have to use the cursor keys to move your character around? Space to jump etc? It just seems so confusing and unpleasant when you could play in front of your tv with a purpose built controller. Sitting for hours at my PC playing RDR2 with my keyboard sounds a lot worse than chilling on my sofa playing it on my PS4. Edit: OK so I can see I #8217;m being downvoted for asking this, which sucks, but maybe my question sounded hostile or something. Anyway, no offence intended and thank you to respondents for educating me.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-11 17:08:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK so I feel like I #8217;m entering a minefield here. When I listen to people talk about how terrible race science is, they often say how it was used by Nazis to justify the holocaust. I don #8217;t dispute that. I thought the purpose of science was to discover the truth. If it really is true that one race is more intelligent than another race, isn #8217;t it better that we know that and figure out how to use that knowledge? For example, if the  #8216;white race #8217; was proven to be less intelligent, we could enact policies to boost their life chances rather than expecting them to compete against other races. If there is no meaningful difference between the races, then surely that #8217;s something we all want to know?! We could take the wind out of racism #8217;s sails just like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to say that it is reasonable to be pissed off with Naughty Dog for this. We should be able to trust what the studio tells us. Something has gone wrong somewhere and I really think they need to get to the bottom of how this happened and make changes to prevent it happening again. It #8217;s not enough to say  #8220;oh they #8217;re only human, game development is hard, gotta think of wellbeing etc #8221;. The point is - Naughty Dog is a premier studio and they need to account for all those things when determining their release date. I love the studio and I #8217;m sure they can figure this out for their next title, but we shouldn #8217;t let them off the hook for this colossal error just because we like what they do.</TEXT>

Any reaction to it is not based on instinct, it is based on reason and logic.

    <TEXT>I think people can be aggrieved by how loud and accusatory some in the community can be. Suddenly people are finding themselves being shouted down as  #8220;transphobic #8221; when they express concern about children being given puberty-blocking drugs or MTF transgender people using women #8217;s bathrooms. The community doesn #8217;t seem interested in understanding their point of view or compassionately educating them. They just want them shut down and shamed. There are also many, many LGBT awareness days and events. Pride Month for the entirety of June. LGBT History Month for the whole of February. It feels like a lot and can give some people the sense that it is being  #8216;rammed down their throats #8217;, especially because LGBT people make up a quite small proportion of the population, and because many people consider a person #8217;s sexual activities to be a private matter. It is basically a massive clash between the old and the new. The traditional and the modern. The LGBT movement is like an express train and is doing wonders for people who previously felt excluded from society. The problem is that the established way of doing things is being challenged and a significant chunk of people who were raised to believe that there are only two genders and that marriage is between a man and a woman are feeling pushed out, and reacting strongly against it. In my own opinion, I support the overall principle of LGBT rights and freedoms but I think they need to tone down the hostility and accept that they need to persuade people through education and empathy, not by shouting and shaming. Real change - enduring change - happens one step at a time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I might just attempt to slow down the outrage train a little... I read the transcript and his subsequent explanation. I don #8217;t think he was intending to suggest that the victims lacked common sense. His point was that the  #8216;stay put #8217; instruction defied common sense. Our common sense would tell us to leave a burning building and the tragedy is that the fire service told them to stay put which led to their deaths. If the fire service had said nothing then people would have left the building. I really don #8217;t think his intention was to criticise the victims of that awful fire. He did a bad job of making his point, that #8217;s all. We need to get better at considering all the facts and giving people the benefit of the doubt.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-11-07 20:49:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>We are always so quick to shout about how the rich are all assholes who don #8217;t do enough for the poor. But the rich pay an enormous amount of tax for many services they don #8217;t even use. Public schools, public healthcare, state pensions etc. The rich don #8217;t use any of these and yet they pay billions to fund them. If you look at the statistics, a few thousand of the richest people pay more tax than a few million of the poorest people. That deserves to be commended. We bitch about the rich but if they upped and left we would be fucked. They get so much grief I wouldn #8217;t blame them for moving to mars when it is made habitable. Then we #8217;ll realise what we #8217;ve lost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but they paid such high tax because they earned so much. The commendation is for them putting their efforts into earning loads of money which led to them paying loads of tax.</TEXT>

If I earn $1 billion and pay 5% tax, that #8217;s still $50 million I #8217;m paying towards public services, which is more than almost everybody else pays in an entire lifetime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The intention shouldn #8217;t matter. Good intentions are meaningless when it comes to funding our schools. Teachers are paid with money not intentions. And the greatest contributors to teachers #8217; salaries are the people who pay the most tax. Even if that tax was only paid as a side effect of them getting rich, they still deserve recognition for making such a large contribution to our society #8217;s success.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Complaining on Twitter is not activism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-07 21:31:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is basically what Obama said recently but I see it so often that I must do a post about it. There is a section of Twitter users who think that tweeting about a perceived injustice is activism, especially if they have a lot of followers. They think that they are raising awareness about the issue and that this is enough to bring about change, or at least make change more likely. They will sometimes come up with a hashtag and pat each other on the back if it starts trending. Real activism involves changing people #8217;s opinions and changing public policy. Believe it or not, many people don #8217;t care about your Twitter account and aren #8217;t interested in your opinion. Particularly these days when we are so politically entrenched. If you want to be an activist, start reaching out to people you disagree with. Make the arguments and listen to opposing voices. Stage demonstrations to promote your message and argue your case that gain widespread media coverage. Stand for election. Don #8217;t just whine on Twitter and speak at conferences full of people who probably already agree with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s probably also worth saying that people don #8217;t normally become true princes or princesses just by marrying a princess or prince. Meghan and Kate are not princesses even though they are both married to a prince. Princess Diana was never technically the correct title for Charles #8217;s wife. It was Diana, Princess of Wales. She was the Princess of Wales but never Princess Diana. As an earlier poster said, the Queen had to intervene to make Philip a true British prince in his own right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sawyer wanting to help Libby</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-12 22:03:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Spoilers below  #8226;  #8226;  #8226; In S2, when Libby has been shot and Jack says he can #8217;t save her but could at least make her comfortable if he had the heroin, Sawyer seems determined to get it for her even though Jack insists Kate come with him thereby discovering the location of his stash. Whilst it is lovely that Sawyer is happy to help it seems a little out of character for him at that point in the story. In S1 he let everybody believe that he was hiding Shannon #8217;s inhalers even though he didn #8217;t really have them. If he #8217;d told people he didn #8217;t have them they could have begun a search and maybe helped her sooner. He wasn #8217;t bothered about her suffering. Then he goes to all that effort to steal the supplies from the hatch and makes a big show of how he is the new  #8220;sheriff #8221;. He tells Sayid he #8217;ll die before he gives up the location of his stash. But now here we are with Libby about to die and Sawyer goes rushing off to get the heroin so she doesn #8217;t suffer. It #8217;s not even like she can be saved. He does it just to ease her passing. What do you think? Seems a little too nice for Sawyer IMO.</TEXT>

The islanders are getting their first look at Claire #8217;s new baby and then Jack spots Shannon in the distance and walks over to tell her that Boone has died. I like it because of the juxtaposition between new life and unexpected death, because the sequence is done without any dialogue, and because the music is beautiful. The music is called Life and Death. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never really took to the tailies except for Bernard. The show had such a strong cast. I loved Locke, Jack, Hurley, Sawyer, Walt, Jin, Juliet. I liked Sayid when he was in super smart mode like when he knows that Michael had been compromised, Jack, Kate, and Sawyer have been captured, and Ben is one of the Others. He annoys be a bit though with the Rousseau. He #8217;s all worried about taking them to see her then Hurley just gives her a hug. Shannon was also a bit bland. Boone was annoying with how he put down and patronised Shannon all the time. Kate irritated me when she was seeming to string along Jack and Sawyer, making them both think they had a chance. Locke was just so complex and interesting as a character that I always enjoyed watching him on screen. Juliet was the same, she was played so well and I felt that she had a depth that made her a compelling character.</TEXT>

My overriding thought is that I can #8217;t believe I used to wait a whole week until the next episode. The drama is so exciting I just can #8217;t wait for the next episode. Also the plot gets fairly confusing with figuring out whether the others can be trusted and the time travel.

    <DATE>2019-11-16 16:42:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve just watched the episode called The Constant. I #8217;m as confused now as I was when I first watched it about 10 years ago. The time travel thing. My understanding is that 1996 Desmond kept jumping forward to 2004. Then he #8217;d jump back to 1996 with all the memories he had from 2004 ie the need to visit Faraday at Oxford. 1996 Desmond jumps forward to 2004, gets his instructions from 2004 Faraday then jumps back again to 1996. 1996 Desmond then visits 1996 Faraday and gives him the instructions to let his mouse time travel. So why doesn #8217;t 2004 Desmond remember any of this happening to him in 1996? Shouldn #8217;t he remember that for one mad day in 1996 he kept jumping forward to 2004? Shouldn #8217;t he have recognised Sayid when he first met him on the Island? Shouldn #8217;t he have recognised Faraday? And shouldn #8217;t Faraday have immediately recognised Desmond? Please help - my brain is turning into a fried egg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find the whole concept of  #8216;whatever happened, happened #8217; fascinating. I suppose Jack is thinking that Ben is going to survive one way or another because they have seen him in 2004. Jack probably doesn #8217;t want to dirty his hands or carry the weight of knowing that Ben Linus was able to terrorise them because he saved him. He is probably also thinking that, if Faraday is wrong and you can change the future, then it would be better to let Ben die because everybody would be spared the harm he will cause when he grows up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should think of the chronology of their lives and the chronology of normal time as being different things. Time passes in a set order, right? The years progress 1977 to 1978 to 1979 etc. Normally our lifespan passes in the same order. We are born in, say, 1980 and in 1981 we are one year old, in 1982 we are two years old and so on. When the islanders time travel the link between the progression of their lives and the progression of the years are separated. If one of the time travellers turned 30 in 2004, they then travel back to 1977 and in 1978 they will turn 31. So, when Ben researched their lives in 2004 he was only investigating their past. Even though 1977 is earlier than 2004, the islanders hadn #8217;t traveled back there yet. 1977 is their future and only when they travel back there does it become their present.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Publicly owned industries become fat and lazy. They do not operate efficiently because the management don #8217;t care. Why should they? There #8217;s no riSk of going out of business. Run out of cash? No worries - the government will stump up more. Private enterprise works because the fear of going out of business exists. It #8217;s not perfect but it #8217;s closer to being perfect than nationalised industry is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally agree but I think a lot of people misunderstand what I #8217;m pissed about. I don #8217;t blame the developers. I know they are working hard and it #8217;s important they don #8217;t over stress themselves. The devs are awesome. I also know that a delayed game is better than a broken game. I #8217;m annoyed because ND made a big fuss about not giving any hints about the release date until they were sure. We waited and waited but trusted that they would tell us when they could. Then they announce Feb 21st and we all get super hyped and excited for the game. I book time off work to play it. Then they tell us that it #8217;s another three months. I #8217;m not pissed that it #8217;s coming out in May. I #8217;m pissed that they announced Feb then changed it to May. Are they going to change it again? Who knows. I #8217;m pissed that I love ND but I can #8217;t trust them on dates any more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone complains about tuition fees but they actually raised the salary you need to earn before you pay any of it back. That appeals to aspirational people. Instead of paying back when I #8217;m earning  #163;15k I don #8217;t have to pay anything until I earn  #163;21k (or whatever). Labour aren #8217;t interested in social mobility. They don #8217;t want the working class to climb up to become middle class. They see being working class as a state of grace, as something to be proud of. They just want to make sure the working class and unemployed get handouts from the state and that the bill is stuck to the  #8220;rich #8221;. The Tories at least want to help people get on in life, although they are far from perfect. I would be voting Lib Dem if it weren #8217;t for their extremist Brexit policy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can I offer some advice? Maintaining ideological purity and coming up with policies that make the Labour Party feel good about themselves is not enough. Castigating the electorate for their choice is not going to help, and actually makes you look arrogant and out of touch. And it #8217;s just plain rude and disrespectful. The Labour Party needs to really be a party for the country at large, and not just one that excites its membership. In other words, it needs to appeal to the many, not the few.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Tories are positioning themselves as the party for the so-called  #8220;many #8221;. They put the NHS and police at the centre of their election messaging, alongside Brexit. They #8217;ve promised spending. The point is - they #8217;re not pitching one part of the country against another.  #8220;For the many, **not the few** #8221;. It #8217;s very divisive. It #8217;s the politics of envy and grievance. People don #8217;t want that. Please, for God #8217;s sake Labour, offer us a vision of a country where people are encouraged to succeed and fulfil their potential. Where success and the accumulation of wealth isn #8217;t demonised. Stop offering ludicrous giveaways with the promise to stick the bill to  #8220;the rich #8221;. You might feel good doing that. You might believe that poor people will flock to that. But you are wrong. People don #8217;t want that. People want the state to clear obstacles out of their way. Ensure they get a good start in life. That our children can thrive and do better than we did. And please, pick a leader who isn #8217;t so goddamn moody all the time. I #8217;m ready for you all to fucking hate me now and call me a massive Tory. But you will keep losing until you understand why Blair succeeded where you keep failing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know how common it is in America, but where I #8217;m from we have a two minute silence on armistice day each year. It is a lovely moment where the country is united in silent reflection on the sacrifices made by our forebears in the world wars so that we might enjoy the freedoms we do today. It is simple, it is powerful, and it is very moving. Nowadays we #8217;re having a minute or two minutes of silence for any tragic event. It has become less meaningful. The volcano thing in NZ happened - undoubtedly tragic - and they are having a minute of silence. It just feels unnecessary. It #8217;s the go-to thing to do when there is a mass casualty event. The PM gets the checklist out and top of the list is to do a minute silence. Just because it is a tragic event does not mean it is a national event worthy of national commemoration. Sorry, but that #8217;s the truth. I want us to preserve the poignancy and solemnity of the silence and stop cheapening it by doing it all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suppose ultimately it #8217;s up to the individual to determine what they consider to be an  #8220;official #8221; part of the story. You could write your own ending to DH if you wanted and call it canon, and it would be to you, just nobody else. Generally speaking, a readership accepts the author as the authority on what is canon but sometimes, as with TCC, the author claims something to be canon even though the fandom generally doesn #8217;t accept it. This is difficult because you want the fans and the author to all agree on what the story actually is. IMO, TCC isn #8217;t canon because it breaks so many rules established by the books. The books are the original source of canon so everything that comes after must fit into that universe in order to be considered officially part of it. The movies deviate from the books occasionally but that #8217;s OK. I consider the movies to be an interpretation of the books so they are not canon. How to resolve the differences in your own mind is up to you. I consider TCC to be a story inspired by the books and using the same characters but nothing more, and certainly not part of the official canon. I hate that this puts me in conflict with JKR as she is the ultimate authority on such matters but TCC deviates so substantially from the books that my brain just can #8217;t accept it as canon. Sorry. Edit: I #8217;ll just add that I do consider Pottermore, author interviews etc to be canon. I find these little nuggets of info very interesting actually and they add to my enjoyment of the story. I guess my rule is anything produced by JKR and JKR alone is canon. Movies and TCC had other people involved so it #8217;s easier for me to dismiss.</TEXT>

No. Therefore the conclusion is - there is no  #8220;you #8221;, not in the sense we think.  #8220;You #8221; are simply a temporary, emergent phenomenon of many atoms interacting with one another. Best wishes.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I need some advice on downloading media bought from Apple</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-08 17:25:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few years ago I bought an audiobook from Apple. That audiobook is no longer sold in the iTunes Store and Apple tell me I can #8217;t re-download it. That means my purchase is lost and my money wasted :-( I don #8217;t want to waste my money again so I want your advice on what I should do with the movies and TV shows I have bought from the iTunes Store. At present, I have downloaded almost none of these. I just stream them as and when I want to watch. I #8217;m beginning to think this is a little foolish as I suppose I would lose the ability to watch them if Apple suddenly stop selling them. What do you think? Should I be downloading everything I buy? And which device? Downloading everything to every device seems overkill but I don #8217;t know. Thank you for your consideration of my problem!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think bird is derogatory. In many parts it #8217;s simply part of the local vocabulary. Sometimes someone might use it to intentionally be demeaning but 9/10 it #8217;s not meant to be an insult. Tart, on the other hand, is almost always derogatory so watch out for that one. It #8217;s not on the same level as bitch, but certainly not a term of endearment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your info! Do you think it has something to do with the settlement of America expanding from east to west?

    <TEXT>The monarchy only costs about  #163;1 per person per year so not bad at all IMO. The British Monarchy goes back centuries, even millennia, so it is woven deeply into British culture and the British psyche. I like having a Head of State we can all get behind and respect, rather than someone political who half of us would hate. I think the stability it provides might help us be a little happier, or at least less uncertain. The Queen has been the Queen for all my lifetime and all my parents #8217; lifetimes. The country has changed so much but we can still look to the Queen as a symbol of strength and stability. When she comes out each Christmas and delivers her message to the nation, it feels like our grandmother passing on her wisdom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m going to apologise in advance for the long post but I think this needs answering properly. I don #8217;t care about her skin colour and nobody I #8217;ve spoken to does either. I #8217;m sure there are racists around who do but it #8217;s not a majority of people by any means. My view is that criticism of her (and him) is due to their  #8220;woke #8221;, preachy actions. They tell us all to save the planet then travel round the world on a private jet, even though his brother flies commercial. Harry said he was only going to have two children as he #8217;s worried about the planet, when his brother has had three children. Seemed like a sly dig to me. Meghan #8217;s family drama is unbecoming as well. She got upset when her father sold her letter to the papers even though she got her friends to give an interview criticising him first. They waited ages to tell us their baby had been born, and then lied - they said she was in labour when actually she had given birth several hours before. They won #8217;t say who his godparents are. This may be hard for a foreigner to grasp but many people, particularly the older generation, expect that certain royal events are handled in a certain way and when they #8217;re not people get fed up. I #8217;m sure the fact that she #8217;s a divorcee rankles more traditional people too. She also made some annoying cupcakes for a charity with meaningless platitudes on them like  #8220;You Are Loved #8221; and  #8220;You Are Enough #8221;. Like, fuck off. You don #8217;t know me and you don #8217;t know whether I #8217;m loved or not. Stop telling me things that you don #8217;t even know. It #8217;s just mindless virtue signalling and I hate it. The move to Canada is no problem now they #8217;ve abandoned their royal status and privileges. They can do what they like, more or less. The concerns initially was that they were receiving taxpayers #8217; money and weren #8217;t going to be doing much work for it, and they were cloaked in the dignity of a Royal title (HRH) whilst seeking commercial deals for themselves. The royals are meant to be outside of that business - they represent far more noble values than commercialisation. In conclusion, simply saying it is about her skin colour is incorrect, in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They aren #8217;t getting taxpayers #8217; cash any more, and they #8217;re repaying they money we #8217;ve already spent on refurbishing their mansion. They aren #8217;t doing any royal duties either, and Harry has given up his ceremonial military appointments. They #8217;ve applied to trademark the Sussex Royal name and apparently want to sell hoodies and calendars etc. I #8217;m sure that the Queen etc will have a lot to say about that as it is very tacky and demeans the royal name. Monarchy means a lot to a huge majority of Brits, and it is supposed to be a beacon of nobility and grace for us all to feel proud of. The idea of Harry and Meghan selling Sussex Royal hoodies on their website makes me feel rather nauseous, to be honest.</TEXT>

The sullen expression, pale skin, dark lips and eyes, the shock of peroxide blonde hair - it was a world away from the classic idea of women being nurturing and kind. Together with Ian Brady, Hindley murdered several children in the 1960s.</TEXT>

I think they changed the text version from unlimited to limited. I might be mistaken, but this part of the letter always bothered me as surely unlimited entrances would make it very hard to defend!

    <TEXT>OK I get you. I guess the thinking is that elderly and sick people are already at risk of dying from any infection. Like, any infection that would inconvenience a healthy person could kill an elderly and frail person. So if the disease is only killing elderly and sick people it is just behaving as any other disease does. In other words it #8217;s not a super killer disease that will wipe out humanity, we should just throw it in the same group as the common cold. Sure, having another disease in the world is never a good thing but such is life. That #8217;s just the way it is. I understand your point though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never really thought of the US as divided until Trump came along. I can understand the political divisions - we have the same here with Brexit. As for cultural division and the other stuff you mentioned, I don #8217;t really have any awareness of that. Except that the west is different from the east. The west is basically full of hippies, the east is full of suits :-) I see the US as a land of opportunity, where success is celebrated not demonised. Where the tall poppies are allowed to grow tall, to coin a phrase. Internal divisions within the country sorta go over my head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don #8217;t vote for things directly often. The most recent one (for Brexit) has made me not want another one for the rest of my life. Voting is not compulsory and the turnout is generally 60-something%. I like voting and would probably support making it mandatory but it is miles from the top of the political agenda so is unlikely to happen any time soon. Especially as forcing many young people to vote could help a socialist labour government win power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Members of the House of Lords are almost all appointed by the political parties elected to the House of Commons. The party leaders decide on who they want to nominate and that person then goes through an approval process. 92 of them are  #8216;hereditary peers #8217;, meaning they inherit their seat from their parent. Tony Blair did away with most of the hereditary peers when he was in power but 92 of them were allowed to remain, as decided by a vote amongst the other members of the Lords. It is an amusing irony that the only elected peers are the hereditaries. I believe some of them are bishops in the church but I don #8217;t know anything about how they get there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think the plot with the Chinese/casino/tusk thing is explained well enough. Also the whole trade war/samarium thing. I think the writers expect us to know how American politics and foreign policy works, which the average person doesn #8217;t. At least in the first season I understood the deal with the education bill etc. I feel like it was explained better. In S2 I find it hard to understand what #8217;s going on, except that it #8217;s all part of some elaborate plot of Frank #8217;s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Answer: She was a quite famous TV presenter in the U.K. Very charismatic, charming and funny. Presented some of the biggest shows including Love Island most recently. She was in legal trouble recently as she was charged with hitting her boyfriend in the head with a lamp while he slept. There were pictures of blood everywhere and apparently the boyfriend was quite distressed when he called the police. It #8217;s all a bit strange as the boyfriend subsequently said that Caroline didn #8217;t hit him with the lamp and didn #8217;t support the prosecution. The police pressed ahead anyway as they had enough evidence and she was due to stand trial in March. After all this drama blew up she was dropped as the presenter of Love Island and her career was looking to be in real jeopardy. She was known as warm and friendly personality and that was severely undermined by the story with her boyfriend. As usual, the newspapers and people on social media had a field day with it all and were very critical of her. The general consensus was that she was domestically abusing her boyfriend and he was too scared to speak out and admit that she hit him. That was all speculation though as she wasn #8217;t allowed to comment publicly to defend herself. But social media and the British press can be brutal and there is evidence from her recent Instagram posts that she was feeling overwhelmed by it all. The idea of Caroline Flack killing herself is difficult for the British public to make sense of because it seems a million miles away from the person she appears to be on TV. It is quite shocking actually. Suicide is not a simple thing. We don #8217;t know why she chose to end her life but it is certainly a tragedy for her family and friends. I think people want simple solutions so will just blame the criticism she received recently but the truth is we just don #8217;t know what was going through her mind. I #8217;ll miss feeling the warmth of her personality coming through my TV screen.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Notes from the Left Behind stream</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-20 14:27:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I noted some information shared during the recent Left Behind stream. * The use of two malls in Left Behind was partly due to the production advantages from reusing assets etc. * Ellie and Riley #8217;s story was the only serious contender for a DLC. There was an idea to do something about Joel and Tommy but it never went anywhere. * The developers were mindful that most DLCs take place away from the main game #8217;s story. They wanted to break with that convention for Left Behind and weave the story into the main narrative. * Left Behind release was delayed because they didn #8217;t feel the ending was strong enough so they took another month to add the chase sequence. The original ending showed the clicker ambush during the dancing scene then returned to after they were both bitten. * Ellie acquired her palm tree t-shirt from the department store she and Riley have their water gun fight in. It can be seen hanging in the background. Coincidentally, the last time we see this t-shirt is in the  #8216;present day #8217; part of the DLC where she uses it to dress Joel #8217;s wound. * The idea for Left Behind came after the comic book was published, and Riley #8217;s closing lines to Ellie were inspired by the comic. * Neil mentioned how he has gotten used to having a dodge button from playing Part II and he misses it when he plays the original games. * The bow and arrow statue shown in the present day mall can be found as a little statuette in Uncharted 4. * For legal reasons all of the businesses shown in the games are fictional, and a lot of them are references to Naughty Dog artists or their friends/family. * Ashley Johnson recently finished replaying through TLOU 1 as a refresher. * Neil and Ashley had a lunch where they discussed the story for Part II and Left Behind, indicating that the early development of the sequel was happening several years ago. By the time Left Behind was being developed they knew they would be making a sequel to the main game starring Ellie. * Chelsea Tavares auditioned for the role of Riley but lost out to Yani King. Chelsea has been cast in Part II in an unspecified role. * One of Ashley #8217;s favourite scenes to film in Left Behind was the kiss between Riley and Ellie, partly because it was fun to do the awkward teen dancing. * Neil was nervous to film the kiss scene and was asking whether they needed to clear the room to film it. * The story of Riley and Ellie exploring the abandoned mall is a metaphor for skipping school. * The character of Winston had died by the time of the Left Behind story. This was done because there wasn #8217;t time to write and cast the role. * The horse was added in the comic to explain how Ellie knows how to ride horses in Part I. * Neil joked that Left Behind features a wolf mask and  #8220;maybe that will have significance later #8221;. * They couldn #8217;t get the license to use Magic 8 Ball so they created their own - Skeleseer. * The brick throwing contest was inspired by Neil #8217;s childhood where he and his friends did a little vandalism. * Ashley and Neil both commented on how Ellie is very different by the end of Part II from how she was in Part I and Left Behind. The character has evolved a lot. * Several parts of Left Behind were re-shot to include a few hints at the chemistry between Ellie and Riley so the kiss scene wouldn #8217;t feel like it came out of nowhere. * The story of the helicopter crew deliberately paralleled Ellie #8217;s story in that they were both about somebody being sick and their friends trying to save them. The developers also wanted to show that it was possible to save a person #8217;s life if you amputated an infected limb soon enough. * Neil referenced a Reddit post about how Ellie says something at the end that she learned from Joel earlier on. The users were crediting Naughty Dog with great storytelling for making this reference but it was accidentally the result of  #8220;bad writing #8221; by Neil. * The last scene shot in The Last of Us was a fail state where Ellie catches on fire. * There is a bug in Left Behind where throwing a brick at a Clicker sometimes doesn #8217;t work. * Troy wasn #8217;t present for the production of Left Behind and Joel #8217;s audio was taken from the original game. * Ashley mentioned she wished you could still move when playing a recording, which Neil seemed to agree with. * The carousel was included to show that even in a harsh world there could be moments of pure innocence. * When Ellie is reading jokes to Riley it was the first time the actors had heard them. Their responses were genuine. * The photo booth sequence too a long time to get right. * The arcade game was included as a response to the hostility for QTEs that existed at the time. They wanted to make a really awesome QTE. * Ellie imagines herself playing one of the broken arcade racing games. Afterwards she comments that a game about shooting race cars is stupid. Neil included this as a reference to Jak X, which he found to be challenging to make. The player can get a trophy called Nobody #8217;s Perfect. * They were going to put a PS4 on a shelf during the water gun fight but Sony asked them not to because it hadn #8217;t been properly released yet. * Neil has considered telling other stories in TLOU world and following other characters. * Neil suggested using a rock song for Ellie and Riley to dance to but Bruce Straley favoured the one that they ended up using, which Neil also liked. * Music plays a much bigger role in Part II. * When thinking about music for the Part II reveal trailer they first looked at Johnny Cash music. This lead to the discovery that Shawn James has covered Cash #8217;s music and they eventually decided to go with an original Shawn James track which fit the trailer well. * The music is usually a folksy theme in keeping with the Americana tone of the TLOU franchise. * There is a scene in Part II where Troy Baker put his thumb on his pants. When the developers reviewed the motion capture data and noticed this they had to change the character design because it meant Joel #8217;s shirt would have to be tucked in. * The credits at the end of Left Behind are shown as cards rather than scrolling because it compresses better and takes less storage space.</TEXT>

Then, one of them says something like  #8216;should we take some notes and put them into deathtrap? #8217; It got me thinking...what is  #8216;deathtrap #8217;.

    <TITLE>We should label actions and words, not people, as racist</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I often see people being described as racist.  #8220;He #8217;s a racist! #8221;  #8220;She is totally racist! #8221; I don #8217;t think this is helpful. I think certain actions can be described as racist. For example, if I owned a hotel and I refused to accept bookings from African-Americans, this would unquestionably be a racist thing to do. The N-word is widely regarded as a racist term. The problem comes when you describe a person as racist. By doing that you are making a statement on who they are, at their core. You aren #8217;t helping that person to change their ways, you aren #8217;t educating them. You are basically dismissing them as a lost cause. The way to defeat racism is to understand that people are complex things with many facets. We need to teach one another what (and why) certain actions and words are racist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know about percentages of people. I #8217;m not dodging - I really just don #8217;t know. I #8217;m sure that many, many people who hold racist views do use the N-word. I #8217;m sure that if you came across a white person who casually throws that word around, it would be pretty safe to assume that they hold racist views. My point here is that we should tackle people #8217;s actions and their words, not the person themselves. Many people, particularly the older generation, grew up hearing their parents use language that would be unthinkable today. I hear it from elderly members of my own family from time to time. If we want these people to change their behaviour and see the error of their ways, we have to focus on what they need to **change**. Tell them that they shouldn #8217;t do this or say that, rather than simply calling them a racist. People get very defensive if you call them that and it just drives them further away from enlightenment. People will keep doing and saying racist things until we are willing to engage with them constructively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No - I disagree with the fundamental notion that a person  #8220;is racist #8221;. I believe that people can do racist things, say racist things and hold racist views. If you believe that certain people  #8220;are racist #8221; then why bother engaging with them? Why bother trying to change their views? Their views would simply be an expression of who they are as a person and so there would be no point trying. You could just label them racist and move on. The problem with that is that you will only sow division and mistrust. I am saying that you should forget about the idea that some people are racists. Forget about it. Instead, focus your attention on what people do and say. Understand that a person can do something racist or say something racist without fundamentally being a racist to their core. That is the point I #8217;m trying to get across but I #8217;m sensing you don #8217;t agree with it. I proposed a hypothetical example to you. What if somebody used a racist word because they heard it in a song? Would you believe that that person  #8220;is a racist #8221;? I believe that the use of the word is wrong but, as I #8217;ve said, I don #8217;t believe that anybody can be simply labelled as a racist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, that #8217;s really helpful. I have some follow up questions: What is an affiliate? What does it mean when a network is affiliated throughout the country? Do you guys have different stations in different parts of the country? In the U.K. we have, for example, a TV station called BBC 1 that everybody in the country can watch. How does it work in America? I ask because you said syndication means a show was sold to various stations throughout the country. In the U.K., if the BBC buys a show it gets broadcast on BBC 1 and the whole country can see it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. So is it only called syndicated when it is replayed? For example, if a TV show was on a Cable TV channel and afterwards was bought and broadcast by FOX, would you call that a syndicated show?</TEXT>

A word for something that will cause you harm but moves slowly and carefully so you don #8217;t notice and by the time you notice it #8217;s too late to do anything.

    <TEXT>It differs depending on the country etc but in the U.K. the experts were saying that when it starts to peak there will be a much larger number of cases each day. I don #8217;t know numbers but we #8217;re getting a few hundred each day and that isn #8217;t the peak. I guess a few thousand or tens of thousands a day...again, this is just my speculation though. The point is that taking measures now might seem good but this thing is going to be around for a long time and you don #8217;t want people to be getting frustrated with the closures right around the time they are most important.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We leave mandatory education (school) at age 16, after completing our GCSE exams. If you chose to continue your education you go to college for 2 years. At the end of those two years you take **A-Level exams**. If you want to further your education even more the next stop is university, which you typically attend for the next 3 or 4 years. At university you get your degree.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Boris is confusing matters by  #8220;advising #8221; that we avoid all  #8220;non-essential social contact #8221;. First of all, advice is just that - advice. The word implies it is up to the individual whether they follow it or not. Language like that certainly doesn #8217;t convey a sense of urgency or essentialness. Secondly, what does  #8220;non-essential #8221; mean? It #8217;s not absolutely *essential* that I go to the shop for food because I could order something via Deliveroo. It #8217;s not *essential* that I go out and buy a headset for my laptop because I *could* have Skype calls on loudspeaker, but that will seriously irritate my housemates and will likely be poorer quality. Does  #8220;non-essential #8221; mean all social contact must be a matter of life or death? Finally, what is  #8220;social contact #8221; anyway? I assume he means socialising with friends but does that mean I #8217;m free to go shopping on my own? Close proximity to fellow shoppers and sales assistants isn #8217;t my idea of social contact but it is certainly human contact. Why has he advised against social contact specifically? If he wants us to avoid all non-essential contact altogether (whether social or otherwise) then why is he allowing retail shops and business offices to stay open? If the shops are open then he must think that solitary shopping is OK? I presume that because my office is open that he thinks it #8217;s perfectly OK for me to attend work if I can #8217;t work from home? His guidance is confusing and doesn #8217;t make a whole lot of sense. IMO he needs to mandate the closure of all non-essential retail stores and business premises. He also needs to prohibit all non-essential contact of any kind. That way we all know where we are and what behaviour is acceptable. This strategy of apparently trying to shame people who elect not to follow his vague  #8220;advice #8221; doesn #8217;t help anyone.</TEXT>

The oppressed could persuade the oppressors to stop oppressing them. That might work. Use reasoned argument to change opinions. What strategy are the oppressed currently using?

We have universal healthcare provided by the gov and fully funded by taxes. Our right wing party probably has more in common with the Dems than the Republicans, at least on social issues. I think the population roughly splits down the middle ie 50% left, 50% right. But most people are probably pretty centrist, or centre-left/centre-right. Tbh we #8217;ve been talking about NOTHING but Brexit for three years and now nothing but Covid so perhaps people #8217;s views have changed and I just don #8217;t know it yet.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Parts of the prosecution case that are just ridiculous</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-11 23:06:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I find it slightly absurd that the prosecution thought that TH #8217;s body was cremated in that open air burn pit using a couple of tyres as fuel. How on earth could that possibly be true?! As the experts say, you #8217;d lose a hell of a lot of heat to the air and it ain #8217;t easy to reduce a body to a few pieces of bone. Also, the finding of flakes of blood in the footwell of the car as though that formed from him bleeding on the carpet there. Obviously the blood would have soaked into the carpet, right?! I don #8217;t understand how they think that blood falling on an absorbent surface would leave nice little flakes. And how about that so many pieces of evidence has SA #8217;s DNA on them and nobody else #8217;s. It was TH #8217;s car but you #8217;re telling me her DNA was nowhere to be found on her own key?! And yet SA #8217;s was all over it from relatively brief contact? I may be missing something but these points just seem crazy to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I agree. We only show a portion of ourselves on social media and a lot of it is performative. We show the world what we want them to see, not who we truly are at our core. The scene in the bedroom where she gets angry and kicks him out, then gets more angry when he doesn #8217;t fight back is my favourite. It shows how when you love a person you love 100% of them, even the parts that may annoy you in the moment. You don #8217;t necessarily want your boyfriend to fight back when you are angry with him but at the same time the fact that he *would* fight back is what makes him, him, and without that there is something missing.</TEXT>

I #8217;m looking to understand how the versions of events presented by the prosecution for the Avery trial and the Dassey trial differ from each other. My understanding is the Avery and Dassey have each been convicted using timelines that contradict each other. For example, Avery was convicted for murdering her in X location but Dassey #8217;s conviction is based on her being murdered in Y location. Is that true?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I hope Dina is well written enough</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-21 20:43:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know most of us have been theorising for a while that Dina gets killed early on and that motivates Ellie to go on a rampage to seek revenge. I #8217;m concerned that I #8217;m not going to buy into that, especially if Dina is killed early on. This is a post-pandemic world. People #8217;s priorities are way different to today #8217;s. They are worried about where their next meal is coming from and whether they #8217;re going to get torn apart by clickers the next day. It doesn #8217;t make sense for Ellie to leave the apparent safety of Jackson to go on some mad chase across the country to avenge Dina. If this really is what ends up happening, they will need Oscar-worthy writing to make it credible. We, the player, are going to really need to believe the relationship Ellie and Dina have established and that it is sufficiently meaningful to Ellie. If Dina is killed early on they won #8217;t have much time to build Dina up as a character and her relationship with Ellie. I just really hope Naughty Dog are up to it. My biggest concern is that ND think that the lesbian aspect is interesting enough that the player will buy Ellie #8217;s motivations. It isn #8217;t. I would have a hard time buying it if it was a boy or a girl. I #8217;m sure they #8217;ve thought about all this and the game will be awesome, and I might be wrong and Dina doesn #8217;t die anyway, but all the same I thought I #8217;d just express my current thoughts.</TEXT>

Some people say these were essential changes that rejuvenated the economy and improved standards of living.

But when you tell me I would have to pay  #163;5m and Del Boy and Rodney would be responsible for getting the mansion built...now I have second thoughts. It #8217;s not about coming up with nice sounding ideas that the general public will support on a whim. That #8217;s easy.

    <TEXT>If drugs are so dangerous shouldn #8217;t the government expect that we would choose not to consume them because of the danger? Fabric conditioner would be highly dangerous to drink but I don #8217;t think it #8217;s actually illegal to do so. Surely it #8217;s better to legalise everything and allow people to make their own choices based on the consequences they observe from drug users around them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I noticed this yesterday! So annoying! I #8217;m trying to find a video showing all the gameplay footage ND released to the media last year. Apparently news organisations were told they couldn #8217;t post the whole thing but instead use bits of it and overlay their commentary. Hoping some kind soul puts the full thing out there one of these days.</TEXT>

I thought they were awarded when a person develops an exceptional talent or skill and uses it to achieve something truly remarkable with national significance. I know this story makes us all feel warm and fuzzy but doing laps of his garden doesn #8217;t meet that standard. Honestly the way the establishment are fawning over him, we #8217;ll have an official annual Captain Tom Moore Day next. He #8217;ll be sent to the House of Lords. A statue of him will be erected in London. I just think we need to calm down a bit. Anyway, go ahead - downvote me I guess. Edit: I think a better idea would have been to create a new award in his name ie The Captain Tom Moore Award for Charitable Fundraising. It could be awarded to people who raise significant amounts for charity. Feels more appropriate to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I say this is unpopular because there are articles - including in the esteemed NYT - talking about how it is changing the world etc. Firstly the website design is terrible. When you eventually find somebody you like you can #8217;t really see any content until you subscribe to them which usually costs money eg $15 per month. Before subscribing you can see how many photos and videos they have uploaded but not the content itself. They put a little description on saying what the channel offers eg  #8220;custom content #8221;. Once you subscribe it turns out you don #8217;t get much of anything. You get a few tame shots and the videos are often a couple of seconds long and don #8217;t show anything, obviously uploaded solely to hook potential subscribers who see you have  #8220;10 videos #8221;. They DM you and try and sell you actual content. They ask what pic you want, you tell them, and they respond stating a price eg $20. That #8217;s on top of the money you #8217;ve already paid to subscribe to the channel! I #8217;ve never heard such a nonsense pricing model before. You pay to subscribe but you #8217;re really just paying for the opportunity to pay again for the actual content. I really think this site is a massive con and has clearly spent all their revenue on engineering a phenomenal publicity campaign to drum up suckers like me.</TEXT>

If I shoved somebody and their foot landed on some black ice and they slipped, hit their head and died, I #8217;m not sure that would qualify. However if I punched somebody in the face right next to a freeway and the force of my punch knocked them in front of a car and they died, that probably would qualify because although I hadn #8217;t intended to kill them, I should have anticipated that my actions could reasonably result in their death i.e. I had not shown proper regard for their life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Your thoughts on Joel?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-01 22:17:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I know the general consensus here is that you hate that Joel is killed and how, but I wanted to ask something. I think it makes sense that Joel #8217;s past catches up with him. We know from the first game that Joel has been living a violent existence for some time. He and Tess are feared in Boston and he tells Ellie he #8217;s  #8220;been on both sides #8221;. The idea that there are no  #8216;good guys #8217; in a post-apocalyptic world is an interesting one to explore. The fireflies would certainly believe themselves to be good...they are searching for a cure and rebelling against an oppressive military. It makes sense that they would see Joel as a bad guy after what he did at the end of the first game. That, to me, is interesting. Furthermore, Joel #8217;s murder is a great catalyst for the Part II story. The player immediately buys Ellie #8217;s thirst for revenge. If it was Dina who was killed we wouldn #8217;t buy it so much because we don #8217;t know Dina like Ellie does. We know Joel and we love him. Ellie wants revenge and so do we. It works. It also supports the theme of the  #8216;cycle of violence #8217; and the idea of there being no  #8216;good guys #8217;. Abby thinks she is righteous for avenging her people, Ellie thinks she is for avenging Joel. Finally, the notion that you actually play as Abby also feeds into these ideas. As a player you instinctively develop empathy for the character you play as. Especially with ND quality characterisation and writing. It is provocative and forces us as the player to question who is right and who is wrong. So, even though I know a lot of people hate the idea, I at least applaud ND for taking this interesting path with the game and look forward to seeing how it pans out. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-03 23:51:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>They are concerned about one thing and one thing only - their public image. They are shitting themselves about striking the wrong note so they are going a million miles in the opposite direction and offering meaningless platitudes, hashtags, and black squares. Look, I get it. I #8217;m sure these people feel compassion and almost everyone would recognise that society is prejudiced against black people but spouting SJW nonsense on Twitter isn #8217;t going to help. Take PlayStation for example. Cancelled their PS5 announcement to  #8220;allow more important voices to be heard #8221;. Bullshit. They don #8217;t want to be seen having a party. Lea Michele paying lip service about racism before being outed as a racist herself, then offering an  #8220;apology #8221; that is nothing except a masterclass in attempting to win the plaudits associated with owning up to one #8217;s mistakes whilst simultaneously not taking responsibility for them. Reddit turning their App icon black. I mean, come on. How does that help anyone? Endless people saying we  #8220;stand with the black community #8221; or some such drivel. Yes, of course we all feel compassion and sympathy but standing with somebody actually means standing with them, physically out there on the street shoulder to shoulder with them. Can you imagine if even 25% of NYC came out and marched on the street for this cause? It would make news around the world. But people don #8217;t. Why? Because people only care enough to tweet and brands care only about themselves. Edit: an example of someone I admire in this is David Schwimmer. Posted a photo on Instagram of him out there, protesting on the street. And you could criticise him for earning social media points from it but so what? He #8217;s out there, presenting himself physically in support of the issue, and promoting it on Instagram may encourage others to join. He really is standing with the black community, doing what needs to be done to effect change.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Problem with Trailers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-04 18:47:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a problem with the trailers Naughty Dog released for this game. My problem is: the are extremely misleading. The trailers clearly imply that Joel survives the  #8220;violent event #8221; and accompanies Ellie on her quest for revenge, perhaps reluctantly. They obviously want us to think Dina is killed. I think this is so shady of Naughty Dog to do this. Maybe they felt alarmed that people were theorising about Joel #8217;s death almost straight away after the game was announced and they wanted to throw us off the scent but those trailers amount to lies. They deliberately misled us to believe the story was one thing when it was actually something else. To be clear - my objection isn #8217;t to the story itself. It #8217;s their game and they are free to tell the story they want to tell. No problem with me whatsoever. My problem is with the deception. It makes me question their attitude towards their fans in general. The way they delayed the game twice after making such a big deal of not announcing a date until they were certain, also shows a cavalier disregard for the fans, who ND were deliberately hyping up with (misleading) trailers and events for years. I love this studio and I love their content, but I dislike being lied to and treated like a fool. They need to change their ways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Misdirection would be showing Ellie alone, wearing Dina #8217;s bracelet. That would suggest that perhaps Dina died and Ellie took her bracelet to motivate her on her quest.

    <TEXT>The original philosophy behind Toy Story was based around the idea that objects that fulfil their purpose are happy and those that don #8217;t are sad. The purpose of a cup is to hold water, so an empty cup is sad whereas a full cup is happy. The purpose of a toy is to be played with by children, so when the child gets a new toy the old toy will be sad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh Jesus, bins and bin collections are a major issue here. First of all, there was a massive drama when weekly bin collections were changed to once every two weeks. It #8217;s the kind of thing that could start a civil war. We all had to start recycling instead and people got confused etc etc. I dunno why Britain in particular cares so much about this but we are obsessed. Around Christmas time everyone starts talking about when the bin collections are and when  #8220;bin night #8221; is etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dunno. ND have said before that creating new games with new characters, new gameplay etc is really, really hard. We know they don #8217;t want to return to the Uncharted franchise for a while so who knows? They have a series here that is enormously popular with very loyal, committed fans who would absolutely buy a third game. On the other hand, Neil has said before that it can be mentally taxing to work on a game as bleak as TLOU and spend all day, every day obsessing over every detail of such a brutal world. Perhaps they #8217;d like to do something a little more uplifting next.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-09 11:27:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few things have been posted about this but I thought I #8217;d do a text post as wanted to convey how worthwhile I found these videos as a TLOU fan. The designer, Peter Field, plays through a section of the game that he designed and explains the techniques he used guide the player to where he wanted them to go, and how they used gameplay to create interesting story moments. There #8217;s also a second video where he delivers a lecture on game design as he plays through a level he designed on Dreams. He shares a few TLOU tidbits along the way. Both are well worth your time if you #8217;re interested in learning about the method of designing a game like TLOU.

    <TITLE>One of the songs included in Part II</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-13 22:08:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>In one of the pieces written about the new game it is said that Naughty Dog spent considerable time lobbying Pearl Jam to include their song  #8216;Future Days #8217; in the game. Apparently it is important to the narrative and becomes a kind of theme between Joel and Ellie. You may also know that during the unfilmed epilogue scene performed during One Night Live, Joel sings this song to Ellie a few weeks after the events of the first game. Neil has confirmed all this on Twitter. If you #8217;ve done a little detective work you would know that Future Days wasn #8217;t officially released until after the outbreak, so in the world of TLOU the song was never released at all. But fear not - this is not an immersion-ruining error. [A recent tweet](https://twitter.com/neil_druckmann/status/1270871288311996416?s=21) from Neil confirmed that live recordings of the song were on YouTube before the outbreak, so it #8217;s possible that Joel would have seen one of these, liked it, learned it, and performed it in the epilogue all those years later. These kinds of things normally really bug me so just wanted to pass this along in case you would have been bugged too!</TEXT>

As an MP you have no real power to do anything or change any of the stuff you got into politics to change. You just do as you #8217;re told, spend your life traipsing between your constituency and London, deal with the mundanities of people #8217;s problems with their bin collections etc, and live with the knowledge that you are in one of the most despised professions in the country. Sure, the salary is good but below what you might expect in the private sector if you #8217;re halfway competent. And you don #8217;t have the job security you might get working for a successful company. If your constituents tire of you, or even if you #8217;ve done an awesome job but they just tire of your Party, you can be expect to be kicked out unceremoniously and never thought about again.

    <TEXT>I think some of them genuinely want to do good in their community. They have ideas, they want their Party to succeed so they can advance them, and their way of doing that is the stand for election. Other people are attracted to the status and perceived power that comes with being an MP. Even though MPs as a profession are the lowest of the low in public opinion, individual MPs are generally respected members of their community and are invited to open new schools etc. There is a great book called  #8216;Why We Get The Wrong Politicians #8217; by Isabel Hardman that addresses this question and I highly recommend it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s lots I love about this game but... I #8217;m having a hard time buying that Abby would travel all that way just for revenge. And that she could persuade a load of others to come with her. It #8217;s a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Very dangerous. Death lurk around every corner. It just seems weird to me. Also, I am finding it hard to buy that Ellie would then go to Seattle for revenge. It just doesn #8217;t make sense. Yes, Joel #8217;s death was brutal and horrible but the danger associated with leaving the safety of Jackson is just wayyyyy too much. And the Dina goes with her. I dunno, I guess I #8217;m just not convinced that rational people would behave that!way.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-20 21:11:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here #8217;s what I thought: My biggest problem with the game is the motivations of the characters. I just don #8217;t believe that Ellie or Abby would cross hundreds of miles of post-apocalyptic wasteland to get revenge. I also don #8217;t believe that Tommy would go out ahead on his own, or that Dina would happily accompany Ellie. Dina and Tommy should have been convincing her to stay. Joel seems a bit soppy in this one, especially in the prologue when his sings to Ellie about how sad he would be to lose her. It feels out of character for him as he didn #8217;t used to like talking about his feelings. I #8217;m not convinced that Seth would be so aggressive about Ellie and Dina kissing, or that Ellie would be using a word like  #8216;bigot #8217;. She would have just called him a dick or something. Homophobia is an issue in today #8217;s world, not a post-apocalypse where people are dying and regular society has collapsed. I think the Lev being trans thing is pushed a little too hard. I liked the initial exchange where Scars call him Lily and Abby asks whether he wants to talk about it. That felt like enough. But the cutscene where Yara explains how Lev  #8220;feels inside #8221;, and Abby being very understanding and sympathetic was too much. I don #8217;t believe that Abby would be interested enough for that. Pregnant Mel going on that expedition with Abby was silly. Sure, if you #8217;re pregnant you can help out here and there but climbing ropes etc? No, sorry, don #8217;t believe it. It got a bit Uncharted-y at the end, and not in a good way. The burning Scars village and the baddy who kept fighting even after half his face was ripped off felt like something from a different game. It was too sensational for the TLOU, which is supposed to be grounded. Visually, the game was absolutely beautiful. The environment art, the lighting, the level design, the sheer beauty of it left me speechless. At several times throughout I found myself in total awe at what a visual masterpiece the game is. Ashley Johnson is top notch. When Abby was killing Joel I felt a little flat because I #8217;d seen the leaks but her scream of  #8220;you #8217;re gonna fucking die #8221; made me tear up. She really sold the moment to me. I thought she was great throughout. I don #8217;t know how the WLF would come to produce so much branding ie patches on their clothes or big signs to hang up around the place. Where is all the equipment coming from to do that, and how is it being powered?! It felt out of place. And how dumb do they have to be to wear their branded merch when they go to kill Joel. They might as well have left a map with their home address. Another believability issue. I know it #8217;s been said a lot but Abby #8217;s physique is absurd. I #8217;ve never seen a woman with arms as big as that so I don #8217;t know where they got the inspiration from. I actually wonder whether Neil Druckmann is trolling the anti-woke people with her character model. Jesse #8217;s death was done well. The quickness of it made sense - he was nobody to Abby and she killed him just like Ellie kills anyone who gets in her way. It has that perennial Naughty Dog problem where they want to have emotional, believable characters but also want them to do completely unbelievable things. Ellie is very traumatised after she beats Nora to death but she #8217;s beaten loads of people to death in gameplay. I liked how Ellie let Abbie go at the end when that flash of Joel came on screen. I found that quite moving actually, the sudden juxtaposition of peaceful Joel as Ellie is killing Abby. I liked the ending. How Ellie has lost everything, even her ability to play Joel #8217;s song properly, because of her own actions. Even though I have problems with elements along the way, I thought the ending worked. The story felt like one that could have been told in any  #8216;world #8217;. It didn #8217;t have to be The Last of Us. This could have been told in the modern world, or the Uncharted world. I think that #8217;s one of my big issues. They had a story they liked but it #8217;s not really a TLOU story, IMO. It doesn #8217;t stop to contemplate what the fall of civilisation means, like the first one did. In the first one, characters would often comment about how society is different and the letters you found showed how people reacted to it. There isn #8217;t much of that in this one. Overall I think the tone of the game was wrong and believability was a big issue. I think Naughty Dog weren #8217;t able to measure up to their exceptionally large ambitions for the story. But there are several big redeeming features that still mean the game is one of my favourites.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8216;Kill your darlings #8217; means get rid of the stuff that #8217;s only in there because you like it rather that it serving the story. Joel was a great character but his story was completed when he got over his daughter #8217;s death and accepted Ellie as an  #8216;adoptive #8217; child. He had nowhere else to go, hence keeping him didn #8217;t make sense. I do agree that the overall story does smell of self-indulgence a little. I think the writers got carried away with their story and forgot to think about whether it really made any sense or was believable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw the leaks but went in expecting it to be a great game. Naughty Dog know what they #8217;re doing and the leaks lacked context. I did enjoy the game and am midway through my second playthrough already but it was not as good as I had hoped. I have no issue with the LGBT stuff really. It was perhaps pushed harder than seems believable in a post-apocalyptic world but no big deal. My biggest problem is second half of the game. I don #8217;t really like Abby or any of her friends. Owen, Mel, Manny. I didn #8217;t warm to any of them. I hate to say it but I think they were written badly and their dialogue was bad. I #8217;m currently playing as Abby and am bored by her journey to Owen and their backstory. It feels like something from a different game. There #8217;s a lot to love in Part II but overall I think Naughty Dog messed up on the writing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dina constantly making lame jokes and asking annoying questions. Abby hating the scars and having no sympathy at all even when she reads their prayers to the prophet, only to risk her life to return to Lev and Yara to save them. Then risking her life again to get medicine for Yara. Continuing to call the Seraphites  #8216;scars #8217; even when Lev asks her to stop. You #8217;re on your way to save Yara so clearly we #8217;re supposed to buy that you have some sympathy for them, but then you #8217;re disrespecting Lev repeatedly. Manny going on and on about how many women he #8217;s slept with and the game reminding us at every turn by finding a bra in his apartment, or that letter he snatches, or that woman who recognised him. Enough already, I get it. Mel being the most boring human on earth. The in game dialogue is worse than the cutscenes, and the Abby etc cutscenes are worse than the Ellie and/or Joel ones. How can a studio that wrote such simple, beautiful dialogue in the first game suddenly come up with boring, flat dialogue in this one?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-25 08:13:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>*The Art of The Last of Us Part II* presents concept art for the characters and locations, and it is presented in the same order that the story unfolds in the game. The art is accompanied by snippets of text telling us more about why a particular design or location was chosen, and why each character is doing what they #8217;re doing. IMO the story reads a lot better on the page than it did in the game. It feels less sensational, more grounded. If you loved the first game and felt Part II deviated from that magic tone and style, I recommend the book.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;m disappointed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 22:02:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love the first game. It means a lot to me, as I know it does to you. I don #8217;t feel the same way about Part II. Parts of it are excellent but the tone of the game was too far removed from the first game for me to connect with it as much. The first game told a simple story in a simple way. A man has to escort a girl across the country to save the world. The dialogue was tightly written and meaningful. The world was grounded. The characters were relatable and behaved in believable ways. The game was infused with a sense of loss. Several characters die. The notes you find around the place speak of families experiencing the fall of society. The whole thing feels a little like a meditation on the nature of our modern world and who we are when all that is stripped away. The story of the second game is poorly told and the world has none of the charm of the first. The game just feels different. It #8217;s more than it being darker in mood. It #8217;s as though it was written by people who didn #8217;t understand what the first game was. The characters we know behave in ways that don #8217;t make sense. We know Joel is a ruthless survivor who can spot a Hunter ambush attempt. The second game asks us to believe that he and Tommy would walk into a room of strangers and give their names. It just doesn #8217;t make sense. The first game established the danger of the world. We buy Joel and Ellie #8217;s journey because the cure for mankind depends on it. Despite the risks, it makes sense. The second game shows us that characters are comfortable enough to travel hundreds of miles between Seattle and Jackson to get revenge. Again, it doesn #8217;t make sense. There are other problems I have with it but I won #8217;t bore you with them. In short - a lot of the dialogue is cheesy and superficial, most of the new characters are bland, and the second half is boring in parts. I hate thinking this because I wanted to love this game so much. I #8217;ve been looking forward to it for years. Pre-ordered it as soon as I could. Took time off work to play it. And it breaks my heart a little that I feel so disappointed with the final product. I hope you guys who love the game understand that not everybody who criticises it is a far-right transphobe. I #8217;m just a regular person. I hope that Naughty Dog take time away from all the 10/10 reviews to reflect on the opinions of people like me so that the next game in the series can recapture the magic of the original.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t mind that Ellie #8217;s journey is foolish and not worth it. It makes sense that those considerations would not matter to her if her drive for revenge is so strong. I find it difficult to accept how readily Dina agrees to accompany Ellie. And then how Tommy goes out ahead on his own. The distance between Jackson and Seattle is several hundred miles. It #8217;s a non-trivial journey that would be fraught with risks, if we are to believe that the outside world is as dangerous as the first game shows us it is, and the big walls around Jackson implies that it is. IMO Dina and Tommy should have been convincing her to stay. Helping her work through her grief amongst the community. Sure, Tommy gave it a go but Dina didn #8217;t, and none of them (including Ellie) seemed to give a second thought to the fact that travelling hundreds of miles on horseback in a post-apocalyptic wasteland is a really dangerous thing to attempt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mainly the characters. Most of them are hard to relate to because they lack depth, and they regularly make decisions that seem irrational/unrealistic. Example: Dina says she broke up with Jesse because they  #8220;were on autopilot #8221;. This seems like a superficial reason for a breakup in a world where death lurks around every corner, and one where there are precious few partners to chose from. Dina #8217;s reason for breaking up with Jesse makes sense in today #8217;s world, but not in the world of The Last of Us. Example 2: Entering into a relationship with anybody is a risky thing to do in TLOU. You start caring for someone too much, you #8217;re just setting yourself up for a lot of pain in the likely event that something bad happens to them. Particularly if they are scheduled to go out on the dangerous patrols to clear out infected. This doesn #8217;t seem to occur to Ellie or Dina when they kiss at the beginning. Neither expresses any emotion other than the whole I #8217;ve-got-to-have-you-now thing. Example 3: Abby travels to the Scars island to save Lev despite the obvious extreme risk of doing so, which seems not to occur to her. She has known this kid for one day but it #8217;s enough for her to tell him  #8220;you #8217;re my people #8221; and promptly abandon the stability and community she has with the WLF. Not just abandon, but kill lots of them too. This decision is completely irrational and is not really examined or sufficiently explained at all. As players we can #8217;t relate to her decisions and so we can #8217;t relate to her. If we can #8217;t relate to her, we probably end up not caring about her.</TEXT>

Unless you stay true to the spirit of the original, it just comes off as a bad fanfic. That #8217;s what happened with Cursed Child. HP fans will tell you - it doesn #8217;t deserve to be the successor to the series. It has a different vibe to it, like it was written by someone who didn #8217;t really understand the original. It is wearing TLOU #8217;s clothes, but it #8217;s not TLOU. I am a huge HP fan and a huge TLOU fan...sucks to be me I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with it. It #8217;s like they forgot they were making a sequel to TLOU. They became enamoured with this story and forced it through, ignoring the themes and tones established in the first game. This doesn #8217;t feel like a TLOU sequel. It feels like the good name of TLOU was used to sell a story that the writers were determined to tell.</TEXT>

I can never really reconcile the Abby who shoots Joel in the leg and basically tortures him to death, and the Abby who spends days selflessly travelling over Seattle to save Lev and Yara, who she has only known five minutes and belong to a faction she hates.

    <TEXT>Are there any examples of subtle dialogue in the game that doesn #8217;t hit you in the face with what it #8217;s trying to convey? I can remember tons of examples of dialogue that just seems stupid. Like when Abby says  #8220;Cool #8221;, then Lev asks what it means (which in itself seems weird) and Abby explains, and then later Lev says  #8220;Cold #8221;. Obviously this is meant to humorously show us that Lev is not familiar with the  #8220;modern #8221; world but it #8217;s just so obvious and clunky. It #8217;s not honest to how that conversation would have gone, IMO. A tiny example, but indicative of the game #8217;s dialogue as a whole.</TEXT>

It doesn #8217;t feel honest to her character and is another example of the game spelling things out for us. They could have just had Abby say  #8220;Jesus Christ, Lev #8221; as a way of releasing the tension she felt during the crossing. Throw in some heavy panting and have her stop for a few seconds and lean forward with her hands on her knees, just gathering herself before continuing forward.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I had some ideas for improving the game</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-10 23:39:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>* Ellie should not immediately depart for Seattle. The game should spend longer examining how Ellie is dealing with Joel #8217;s violent death. Her friends should try to help her process her feelings and grieve. Ellie should be shown to be unable to move past her grief, which leads to her seeking out justice in the hope that this makes her feel better. * A significant chunk of the game should cover Ellie and Dina #8217;s journey to Seattle. Show us how dangerous this trip is. It should put a strain on Ellie and Dina #8217;s relationship, as Dina becomes increasingly convinced that it #8217;s not worth it. * Ellie should only want to kill Abby, not all her associates. It #8217;s more believable, more relatable. It makes her position more sympathetic, especially if Point 1 above is adhered to. * As Ellie is approaching Seattle, the game should cut to Abby #8217;s perspective. Get rid of all the WLF story and just keep the cutscene where we learn it was her father Joel killed. Let us play through snippets of the intervening years and show us how she dealt with her father #8217;s death. Jump to after Joel #8217;s death and let us see how killing him hasn #8217;t brought her any real satisfaction. She feels righteous but her father is still dead and it #8217;s not going to bring him back. It #8217;s crucial that they get us to empathise with her, and they can do this by focusing on the grief aspect. * Eventually Abby and Ellie come into contact with each other. Ellie wants answers from Abbie and then intends to kill her. Abby is cornered and tries to explain her reasoning to Ellie, basically trying to save her own life. Ellie is somewhat moved by Abby #8217;s story, recognising the parallels with her own grief. She hesitates. She #8217;s not a killer at heart, and is only started pursuing Abby because she believed that killing her would rid her of her own pain from Joel #8217;s death. She #8217;s come so far to reach this moment though and she has become increasingly convinced that this is what will release her pain. Things reach a climax and Ellie is completely at a loss as to what to do. Tension rises and then, we see a flash of a peaceful Joel on screen. Moments later, Ellie shoots Abby in the head, killing her instantly. * As Ellie leaves the scene, we are shown that a young kid was watching the whole thing, hidden beneath a car or something. We #8217;re shown a brief cutscene where this is shown to be Abby #8217;s younger brother/cousin or something, who was returning from collecting firewood when he saw what was happening and hid. The closing scene suggests that Ellie #8217;s killing of Abby just perpetuates the cycle of violence as now her brother has a motive for revenge. * As the credits roll, the player is left to reflect on the cost of revenge and whether it #8217;s worth it. They have seen that violence only encourages more violence, and at the end of it all nobody has gained anything. They see the costs of seeking revenge from the strain/breakdown of Ellie #8217;s relationship with Dina. As she travels back to Jackson, is she really any better off? There is ambiguity and room for debate. I think this makes for a more coherent message and gives the player something to really mull over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When writing a story, how much about the reasons for characters #8217; actions should be explained, and how much should be left for the reader to think about?

    <DATE>2020-07-14 10:36:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>The gameplay when you #8217;re making your way through the WLF or Seraphites is really good. The levels are so large and filled with all sorts of buildings, vegetation and cover that I always feel like I have lots of options for making my way through. And even if I #8217;m spotted I always feel like I might just be able to escape and reestablish stealth, or throw a brick and grab an enemy as cover. It feels very exciting and tense from the moment I enter an area to the moment I leave. This is really helped by the ability to go prone in grass and still fire a weapon from that position. I remember them saying this in the Grounded doc for the first game. You never want the player to feel like they need to give up and die just so they can restart the level and try again. That is so true here. I never felt that. Even when spotted I #8217;m always able to find a little gap to squeeze through. When my ammo is empty I might find one or two bullets laying around. It #8217;s thrilling. I feel like the best way to enjoy these encounters is to not try and gather every single resource from every corner of the level. It really kills the pacing and makes things a lot harder and more frustrating, especially if you #8217;ve fought to get somewhere only to find the drawer is empty. The best way to play is to try and make your way through whilst taking as little damage and expending as few resources as possible, and not worrying about collecting every little thing. Another thing I #8217;ve learned - Hard mode is great. I played initially on Light and have tried Very Light and Moderate. I feel like these settings don #8217;t make the gameplay sufficiently challenging to me. Without the challenge you lose that sense of this being a harsh world. If you #8217;re a powerhouse and have no trouble blasting through enemies, you lose any tension and the game can feel quite boring. IMO, you need to feel the challenge of Ellie #8217;s journey in order to appreciate the game more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Halley Gross said that they wanted to have Ellie spare Abby to show that there is still some good in Ellie. I don #8217;t like this explanation however because where was that good when she battered Nora to death? IMO killing Abby would have been a better ending because the player would have been left to ponder whether the revenge was worth it. She lost Dina etc but perhaps avenging Joel will bring her some satisfaction at least. In the actual ending, there #8217;s no question about it being worth it - it clearly was not. She lost everything and gained nothing. It feels hopeless and pointless and I #8217;m just left questioning what the story was about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TLOU2 fails to do what Breaking Bad did</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-19 10:26:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>In Breaking Bad, Walter White isn #8217;t the hero or even really the anti-hero. He is often quite unlikable and the audience probably doesn #8217;t support what he #8217;s doing but we want to see how his journey unfolds nonetheless. He is a fascinating character and we follow his journey with rapt attention. Characters will make decisions that seem silly to the audience.  #8220;That #8217;s not what I would do #8221;. You want to reach into the screen and shake them and get them to see reason. But the audience can understand why that character is doing whatever it is they #8217;re doing. Their actions fit what we know about the character, even if they don #8217;t make sense to us personally. In my opinion, TLOU2 is an example of a story trying to do something similar but failing. I don #8217;t like Abby but I #8217;m also not interested in her journey. Characters do unbelievable things and I don #8217;t understand why. It #8217;s not clear why they are doing what they #8217;re doing, even given everything we know about the character.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-21 21:53:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Theory is that Neil lost interest in the game as the HBO series started picking up steam. Game development is very hard and Neil has said several times in the past that getting a AAA game out the door is a miracle in itself. Their ambitions for Part II were so enormous that I wonder whether Neil lost faith in the idea of making a game where you make the player hate a character then try to make them sympathise with that same character in the second half. It seems intriguing on paper but... HBO came knocking and Neil found more of his attention going to that show and others were left to shepherd Part II. Playing through Part II, it feels like there are a lot of poorly fleshed out ideas. Stuff that they started on but stopped bothering with part way through. They bit off more than they could chew and didn #8217;t need any persuading when something easier and more rewarding started asking for their time. What do you think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Naughty Dog should take storytelling lessons from Breaking Bad</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 22:13:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been rewatching Breaking Bad and just today watched the episode  #8216;Ozymandias #8217;, one of the final few episodes of the final season. In it, most characters suffer a lot. Characters we care about. There is anguish, there is pain, there is death. Go on IMDb and you #8217;ll see that Ozymandias has been rated over 100,000 times and maintains an average score of 10/10. Clearly the Breaking Bad audience love the episode, even though its events are unpleasant and hard to watch at times. I like Ozymandias because it feels true to the series as a whole. The suffering that the characters endure has been built towards since the beginning. The episode tells its story in a compelling way and is paced spectacularly well. The characters make believable decisions and behave consistently with what we already know about their personalities. I never felt like the episode was trying to upset me, although the story did upset me in places. The point is I never felt the presence of writers trying to manipulate me into some extreme emotional reaction. Overall, Ozymandias - and Breaking Bad in general - tells a wonderful story. It has incredible highs and terrible lows but it never loses its audience because the storytelling is authentic and consistent. It is made by a team of people who clearly want to tell an interesting story that gives the audience a lot to think about and leaves them satisfied when it #8217;s all over. Obviously this post talks about Breaking Bad but I hope it #8217;s clear that I make these points because I think Naughty Dog failed so dismally at telling its own story and seems to think that people hating the game is some sort of victory because the story was meant to be  #8220;challenging #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve heard that too - they understood their characters, thought about where their head was at at that point in the story and what their next move would be. This is so different to TLOU2 where it feels like the writers forced the characters to do things that make no sense to anyone but allow them to drive their plot around the pre-determined track.</TEXT>

Dina signs up immediately, Tommy gives it a go but then goes himself alone. Nobody seems to recognise that pursuing revenge in this world is almost certainly a death sentence. * Nora giving up Abby #8217;s location even though she could have just lied to Ellie to stop her beating her with the pipe. Ellie wouldn #8217;t have known either way and by the time she realised, Nora would have turned or died. * Lev killing his own mother (OK, in self defence) but apparently not being much bothered by it for the remainder of the game. It #8217;s never mentioned again and Lev #8217;s behaviour or demeanour doesn #8217;t change at all. * Mel going out to fight on the front lines despite being heavily pregnant * Ellie threatening to kill Lev just to get Abby to fight her. This is so absurdly out of character. * Jordan strangling Dina rather than just shooting her. Obviously done so we can have a dramatic moment where Ellie races to free her. There #8217;s probably more, I just can #8217;t think of them at the moment</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I felt like Ellie #8217;s reaction was a bit overdone in the game. The whole exchange actually was melodramatic. Ellie is so upset because what? Joel saved her life? She #8217;s literally pissed off with him because he saved her from death. I think she #8217;d be more conflicted. She doesn #8217;t want to be dead but she #8217;s guilty about her immunity. We should have seen more of that conflict rather than having her just hating Joel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When we switched to Abby, I thought we #8217;d see her perspective on what Ellie had been doing the last three days. Instead she got her own story that didn #8217;t intersect with Ellie #8217;s at all until the last moments at the aquarium. If you want us to sympathise with Abby, you should have had us visit Hillcrest after Ellie had been there and killed a bunch of people. Or even whilst Ellie is there. We should have gone to the hospital and discover that Nora had been tortured and killed. Would have made a more interesting story IMO.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. I #8217;ve watched plenty of movies and TV shows that show the characters learning something that I already know, but that #8217;s fine. What #8217;s interesting is the *character #8217;s* journey towards realising whatever it is e.g. revenge is hollow, love is important, sacrificing for the greater good is worthwhile etc. One of my favourite movies is Inside Out, which shows the character Joy realising that bottling up sadness is a bad idea. Of course, I already know that but the story is excellent because it is about Joy learning that, not *me* learning that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I struggle to figure out what we #8217;re supposed to take from this game, and I #8217;m not sure the writers know either. I read an interview with Gross and Druckmann and, when asked why Ellie goes to Santa Barbara at the end, they gave different answers. I think Neil had an idea he thought was cool - use the unique storytelling medium of video games to make the audience empathise with both sides of a violent conflict - but realised too late that it just wasn #8217;t working. It feels like they just gave up on it at some point and decided to make it passable by adding more stuff e.g. levels, in-game dialogue etc. Example of them giving up on doing things properly: They need us to empathise with Mel so we will disapprove of Ellie killing her. They do this by making us spend time with Mel when we play as Abby. Problem is they also want Mel to be pregnant so we get the whole parallel with Dina. Rather than figure out how to do this elegantly they just get heavily pregnant Mel to go into combat and climbing ropes etc, because that #8217;s where Abby (us) will be. Makes no sense but they didn #8217;t bother thinking of a better way to achieve the same end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;How did this get past anyone? #8221; I #8217;ve been asking myself that since the release. How did so many reviewers give it 10/10?! How can seemingly nobody in that industry see that it has significant story/narrative issues? I don #8217;t get it. I think you #8217;re probably right in your conclusion. Neil has said before that he has been reluctant to give up ideas in the past when he really believes in them. I guess the difference is that in the past there have been others to balance him out. Bruce Straley doesn #8217;t feature much in discussions about TLOU but since Part II came out I #8217;m wondering whether he was actually instrumental in shaping Neil #8217;s ideas into something that worked as a game. Even with that said, I don #8217;t understand how even Neil doesn #8217;t look at this game and see the flaws that I see. To me they #8217;re obvious. These aren #8217;t pedantic criticisms. I see glaring flaws with it that *surely* must have been obvious to Neil too. Who knows? Maybe he was got snow blindness from working on it for so long. Maybe he was distracted by the HBO series. We #8217;ll never know, I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve listened to countless interviews and all I #8217;m left thinking is that the makers of this thing don #8217;t even seem to agree with each other about what the story is. Troy says it #8217;s about redemption. Neil says it #8217;s about love and all its facets. And don #8217;t get me started on the ending. Honestly, nobody over at Naughty Dog agrees about what the ending means or why Ellie did any of the things she did. My theory is that nobody knows, and the game leaves so much open to interpretation that it stops becoming a traditional  #8216;story #8217; and is more a sequence of events that you interpret in any way you want. Kind of like an abstract painting or classical music. You experience it and take from it whatever you take.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Matrix vs TLOU 2</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 23:56:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw today that Lilly Wachowski has said that The Matrix is an allegory for transness. In case you don #8217;t know, Lilly and her sister Lana wrote and directed The Matrix and are both trans women. I was thinking about this and I think it has relevance to The Last of Us Part II. Here #8217;s why... The Matrix tells a coherent story. The characters and their motivations are understandable even if you don #8217;t agree with what they #8217;re doing (ie Agent Smith). By the end credits, it feels like a complete story has been told - a man trapped in a computer simulation has been freed and begun to realise his potential. Beyond the basic plot, the film is rich with meaning and symbolism. Much has been said about the use of religious themes and ideas of free will vs determinism. It explores the idea of absolute truth and whether knowing the truth is always a good thing. Reality vs perception is prominent throughout. Beyond the meaning and symbolism, it also leaves a lot of room for viewers #8217; own interpretations. As Lilly Wachowski says, it could be seen as metaphor for gender dysphoria. I #8217;ve heard others talk about it being an analogy for drug addiction. It is a film about being freed from being controlled, and there is room for each viewer to see their own experience of that in this film. It works on many levels and for many people in many different ways. Contrast this with TLOU2. TLOU2 does not have a coherent plot because the actions of the characters do not make sense to the player. It tries to do symbolism and metaphor but its ideas are so poorly developed that they fall flat. The invisible hand of the writer is very much visible throughout. Rather than individual interpretations being a way for us to find deeper meaning in it, significant interpretation is required to find any meaning at all. The best art has layers. It has the surface layer which can be enjoyed for what it is, and then it has deeper layers that can be enjoyed if you care to reflect on it for a little longer. The Matrix has a surface layer and many layers of depth. TLOU2 has no surface layer and a few hastily assembled levels of depth. The Matrix is a Picasso painting that looks good on a wall but can also be studied for hidden meaning. TLOU2 is a painting with lots of blank space with the viewer left to fill in the gaps with their imagination.</TEXT>

I don #8217;t think  #8216;making sense #8217; is too exotic of an expectation. I used The Matrix as a topical example of what I think TLOU2 tried to achieve, as a way to emphasise the game #8217;s failings to the reader. Comparing and contrasting is a common technique in writing, nothing unusual or controversial.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The writing in Part II is poorer than in the first game. The characters lack depth in Part II, and there are too many plot contrivances that don #8217;t honour the characters #8217; personalities or the world they live in. The game is also too long. My biggest gripe of all is that the game isn #8217;t about the post-apocalypse. I loved the first game because it was about how humans dealt with the fall of society. Part II is not about this at all. It is set in a post-apocalyptic world, but it is not *about* the post-apocalypse. We #8217;re all different and I #8217;m happy for you that you enjoy it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol, well I love marzipan too but each to their own I guess. I #8217;m obviously biased but I love having discussions with others who didn #8217;t like the game because it helps me make sense of my own thoughts. On the surface this seems like a negative, unhealthy activity - spending time trashing something rather than just letting it go and moving on. However, it is quite a cathartic thing to do and the game is so long and so full of  #8216;stuff #8217; (characters, dialogue etc) that there is plenty to discuss. That said, I don #8217;t have much time for the people who just want to drag the game down for superficial reasons, or who use it as a cheap, convenient weapon against the  #8216;other side #8217; in the wider cultural war raging in society ATM. When I #8217;m criticising the game, I like to do it with people who have thoughtful things to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you about sequels. After Star Wars came out, George Lucas asked Irvin Kershner if he would direct the sequel (The Empire Strikes Back). Here #8217;s Kershner reflecting on that discussion:  #8220;And I said,  #8216;Gee George, I don #8217;t think so. It was a phenomenal hit as a picture and a second one could only be... a second one. It can #8217;t be as good because the first one is the breakthrough. #8217; #8221; Ultimately he did go on to direct it but I find his thinking interesting. The first one in a series is always the high point. If a sequel tries to compete with the first by retreading the same ground, it will probably lose because it doesn #8217;t have the in built advantage of being fresh and exciting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with him. The BBC should focus on making valuable information accessible. The BBC is at its best with shows like Fake or Fortune which, despite the bad title, wraps up a lesson about fine art in a compelling detective-like show. Your brain is enriched without it feeling like school. Turn on BBC4 and you might see a documentary about how colours work eg the electromagnetic spectrum, our eyes etc. It #8217;s fascinating and you won #8217;t find it anywhere else. Please spend money on those sorts of things and less money on podcasts that kill brain cells. BTW, I #8217;m all for content that teaches people to think critically but I #8217;m not sure Scarlett Moffatt is the best person to do that. At the very least get an expert on with her ie a NASA scientist on the moon landings episode to answer all her questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And by the way,  #8220;fan service #8221; doesn #8217;t have to mean giving us a nice happy tale of Joel and Ellie going on another adventure. We just want something that stays true to the soul of the original whilst telling a new and interesting story. IMO the majority of fans don #8217;t object to the decision to kill Joel but rather they object to the manner in which the story was told. It feels preachy and lazily written. It feels as though the writers had a story they wanted to tell and didn #8217;t take the time to make sure that it was told in a manner that retained the spirit of the first game. Instead they ditched that spirit and fundamentally changed the nature of the franchise to fit their story. Also it is ridiculously long and it feels arrogant that they think this game is so good that we #8217;d actually want 25 hours of it. My time is precious and for them to think this monstrosity is worth 25 hours of it gets my hackles up.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-18 23:10:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry it #8217;s long but when I start typing I can #8217;t stop sometimes. I thought it might have been interesting if Ellie joined a hunting group in Jackson which goes out hunting for food. Joel has been using his experience to train a separate group that goes on patrols to kill infected. Ellie chose not to join Joel #8217;s group because she feels distant from him after he lied, and her sense of guilt over being immune means she doesn #8217;t like killing infected so chooses to help with hunting food instead. One day, Ellie #8217;s hunting group is set upon by infected. Two of them are bitten. Ellie kills the infected and also her two friends who are bitten. This would be a big emotional point in the game. The killings she was forced into awaken her immunity guilt and she is overcome by grief at the loss of her friends. The guilt combined with her grief drives her to finally confront Joel about what happened at the hospital. He admits to it. She #8217;s furious with him and plans to leave Jackson the next day to find the Fireflies and see whether they can still get the cure from her. She doesn #8217;t care if it kills her at this point. There have been rumours of a regrouping somewhere to the East. Joel insists he goes with her as she can #8217;t survive out there on her own etc. At some point Joel would be killed by the fireflies just as his relationship with Ellie is healing. She is devastated. It turns out Ellie #8217;s mother was a pretty big deal in the Fireflies before she died. She was one of the early members and, with Marlene, helped the group establish a foothold. This leads to the Fireflies agreeing to spare Ellie #8217;s life although they tell her there is no cure and the doctor from the first one was mad (or something). She is still super angry with the Fireflies for killing Joel but the time she spends with them leads to her growing attached to them. They tell her more about her mother and she sees that they have established a nice little community for themselves. She has a sense of belonging with them that she never found at Jackson. The fact that her mother helped to build them means she feels like it #8217;s almost a family for her. I dunno what happens next but a theme of the story would be that there are no good guys or bad guys - everybody is just doing what they need to to survive and it depends on your own perspective. The fireflies saw Joel as the bad guy but Ellie saw them as the bad guys for killing Joel. However Ellie gradually begins to see them as the good guys as she spends time with them etc. There is also a theme of belonging/home - Ellie is  #8216;cured #8217; of her grief/anger/guilt by the warmth and love she finds with the Fireflies. It is extremely rough but I wanted to jot something down that felt to me like it picked up the threads from the first game and continued them in an honest way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah so when I talk about the  #8220;spirit #8221; and  #8220;soul #8221; of the original, I #8217;m talking about things like the personalities of the characters. To me, staying true to the spirit of the story means making a game that feels at home in the TLOU universe. The characters should feel like the same people, and if they don #8217;t the reasons why should be adequately explained. The world in which the story is told should feel the same and - again - if the world *has* changed, this change should be acknowledged and explained. An example of how the spirit of the first game was not honoured: in the first game it was well established how dangerous the world is. Characters would talk about it a lot. Joel tells Bill that he and Ellie will  #8220;probably be dead #8221; in a couple of days anyway. During their journey they regularly encounter life threatening situations. This is abandoned in the second game and characters frequently travel hundreds of miles without any apparent hesitation. Now, maybe the world is safer now but the game doesn #8217;t tell us that it is. As players we #8217;re left with a feeling of something being  #8216;off #8217; about the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IMO it didn #8217;t matter whether or not the cure was real in the first game. All that mattered was that Ellie and Joel *believed* that it was real, and we bought into their journey as players. Part II leans way too heavily into the idea of the cure and presents it as an actual thing. The Fireflies really would have saved the world if Ellie had died. This creates all kinds of questions like the ones you #8217;ve posed and, of course, the cure idea quickly collapses under the weight of the science.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-30 11:44:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is Nick Clegg speaking in 2011. IMO the Lib Dems need to return to the first principles of liberalism when coming up with policies.  gt;There are three main political traditions in Britain: socialism; conservatism; and liberalism.  gt;Socialists support the idea of the good society, typically judged in terms of equality of income. In order to bring about this end they use the state quite aggressively in terms of labour market regulation, centralised public services and through tax and benefits.  gt;Conservatives support the idea of a big society, with responsibility shared throughout society - people are responsible both for themselves and each other. The emphasis is naturally on non-state institutions such as marriage, the family, churches and voluntary organisations.  gt;The liberal ideal is of the open society, where power is vested in people, not in the state or other institutions. This means that individuals need the capabilities and opportunities to chart their own course through life, and to hold institutions to account. So while the good society needs a strong state, and the big society needs strong social institutions, the open society needs strong citizens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dunno what will work for you but here #8217;s what I do: * Have one load out focused on stealth, another focused on marking, another focused on gifting, another focused on reviving. Don #8217;t try to have loadouts that do everything. * Try to flank the opposing team. Get used to the route typically taken around the map and use that knowledge to figure out where the enemy team are likely to be so you can get an easier flank. * Never run. You make noise and stick out like a sore thumb on the mini map. Reasons to run: to escape risk of immediate death, to draw enemies to you, to revive a fallen team mate if they are close enough and about to die and there are no enemies in the immediate area. * Plant nail bombs around the place. Not in plain sight but hidden behind walls etc, so the enemy will inadvertently trigger it. In Interrogations, if you are at immediate risk of death but don #8217;t want to run, plant a nail bomb. That way, if you are downed the enemy won #8217;t be able to interrogate you. * Don #8217;t bother with the purchasable weapons. Use the load out points on skills instead. * If you have the stealth skill enabled that makes you almost invisible in listen mode, don #8217;t ever equip armour. The armour is not invisible and will show up in listen mode. In fact, if someone realises from this that you have stealth enabled they will be more inclined to kill you because a lot of players hate the stealth skill and think it #8217;s cheating (it isn #8217;t). * Don #8217;t wander off on your own unless you can handle yourself. There #8217;s safety in numbers and still plenty of opportunity for kills. * Don #8217;t bother crafting health kits unless urgent. They are all over the map. * Craft items before you need them. If you see a team of enemies and want to Molotov them, it will probably be too late to do that by the time you #8217;ve crafted it. Craft as early as possible. * Always keep a shiv handy for those sweet sweet stealth throat slits. * Reviving and gifting loadouts are a great way to earn parts. If you #8217;re having a hard time earning enough through kills, try those instead. Endure and survive.</TEXT>

If someone strongly disagrees with her opinion, they are also entitled to express that. That back-and-forth between parties with opposing views is a cornerstone of our liberal democracy. Seeking to intimidate, or shout down opinions that you disagree with is simply wrong. Let #8217;s have the conversation and seek to persuade others round to our way of thinking.

    <TEXT> #8226; She doesn #8217;t try to dissuade Ellie from chasing Abby across the country. She is her best friend/girlfriend. She should recognise that Ellie needs emotional support after witnessing Joel #8217;s horrific death and insist she remains in Jackson where she can process her grief. Instead, she enables Ellie by immediately signing up for the quest and, of course, it all ends in tears.  #8226; She basically ignores Ellie #8217;s confession about being immune (the big secret that she #8217;s been keeping for years, the whole reason she ended up with Joel and in Jackson in the first place) and instead tried to steal her thunder by announcing she #8217;s pregnant.  #8226; She serves absolutely no purpose in Seattle other than opening and closing the theatre door.  #8226; She is an ass to Jesse in the party and then kisses Ellie in front of him even though they only just broke up.  #8226; She talks too much when walking around Seattle with Ellie.</TEXT>

They didn #8217;t feel like flat characters to me, like a lot of the other new ones did. Lev is higher because the actor gave him a quirky, detached vibe that I liked. Yara is lower because she caused all that hassle to get the meds and then gets herself killed anyway. Mel because she was reckless going into combat whilst heavily pregnant, and she #8217;s just annoying. Dina is super annoying.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wide levels kills the pacing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-25 20:02:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I thought wide levels would be better because you would have more of the world to explore. It turns out that the wide levels in Part II actually kill the pacing and are therefore a net negative. It takes ages to clear out the enemies and then you need to spend even longer scouring every nook and cranny for resources because they are so scarce. Whilst you do this the plot doesn #8217;t advance and you don #8217;t have much in the way of interesting experiences. It #8217;s just clearing out a dead, abandoned world. There #8217;s no charm to it. In the first game it was fun to explore because of the dynamic between Joel and Ellie. Ellie would ask Joel questions about the  #8216;old world #8217; and it was interesting to see how Ellie #8217;s world view was so different from Joel #8217;s because she was born post-outbreak. Maybe it would be OK if the game was shorter but there are so many wide levels that you have to clear then loot without any characters that are remotely interesting that you end up bored pretty quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I #8217;m not trying to stoke an argument or stir up the pot. I just see this expression a lot and don #8217;t fully understand what it is saying. What are the trans rights that it refers to? To me, human rights are the right not to be tortured for example, or the right to a fair trial. Really basic, fundamental stuff that we all enjoy as human beings. Are trans activists saying that there are some additional rights covering trans people that should be added to our understanding of what human rights are? Or are there some existing human rights that trans people are saying they are excluded from?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Brexit: Current positions of Leavers and Remainers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-29 23:34:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I found something interesting: When I talk to Leavers I know about the referendum they accept that negotiations have been abysmal and they quietly wish we #8217;d never had the  #8220;damned referendum #8221; in the first place. However, because the government did have it, and asked them what they wanted, they felt compelled to vote Leave. In other words, they wish they #8217;d never been asked but since they *were* asked, they said Leave. Remainers I know tend to believe that we need to deliver the result for democracy #8217;s sake. No matter how much they hate Brexit, I don #8217;t know any Remainers who would truly support cancelling Brexit altogether. They know we need to honour the result and, although they don #8217;t like it, they want to see it done (with as little pain as possible). Just thought this was an interesting observation. It seems the British people are a lot more moderate than a polarising referendum would have us believe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obi Wan #8217;s statement is itself an absolute. It #8217;s the use of the word  #8216;only #8217;. If he said  #8220;Siths are more likely than Jedis to deal in absolutes #8221; then that would not be an absolute statement.  #8220;Usually a Sith deals in absolutes #8221;, that would also be OK. His statement leaves no room for manoeuvre. The only people to deal in absolutes are Siths, therefore Obi Wan is confessing himself a Sith. He is correct that Anakin #8217;s preceding statement  #8220;if you #8217;re not with me, you are my enemy #8221; is also an absolute statement. Anakin could have avoided Obi Wan #8217;s accusation by saying  #8220;if you #8217;re not with me, you are probably my enemy #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ellie had the right to consent to what was about to happen to her. The fireflies should have woken her up and discussed it with her first and only proceeded if she agreed. Ellie was kept under armed guard and it is clear that the fireflies will kill Joel if he attempts to rescue her. He can either allow the fireflies to kill her against her will or kill them to rescue her. I refer you to a old legal doctrine called the doctrine of clean hands. The doctrine of clean hands says that if you want to seek redress through the courts for some wrong that you have been the victim of, you have to be able to come to court with  #8216;clean hands #8217;, which means you must be able to say that you didn #8217;t bring any of this trouble on yourself. You are the innocent victim of somebody else #8217;s misdeed. You have clean hands. In this case, the fireflies do not have clean hands. It was only because of their own immoral actions that Joel killed them. If they had done the right thing, none of them would have died.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I found that some Buddhist ideas helped me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 19:34:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I experienced social anxiety a lot when I was younger and I still do now, but more mildly. I found that some of the ideas in Buddhism helped me see the world more clearly, which then eased my social anxiety. For example, there is an idea in Buddhism called  #8216;emptiness #8217;. It is the notion that all things in the universe are made up of other things. They don #8217;t exist inherently. When we look at something and see a car, for example, our brains interpret it as a single object whereas in reality it is actually many objects assembled together. There is no singular  #8216;thing #8217; called a car, there is only many things assembled together that we have decided to call a car. The same is true of people. Look at your hand. You look at it and see a hand but think about all the things that make your hand. There are bones and muscles and skin and fingernails. There #8217;s blood and veins etc as well. Go deeper - the skin is itself made up of skin cells, not to mention hair follicles and other bits and bobs. Your hand is not one thing. It is many things. Our brains just perceive it to be one thing for convenience, but it #8217;s not how it truly exists. When I am in an anxiety inducing situation I try to look at people and focus on all the things that are assembled together to make them. Their bones, organs, eyeballs etc. The person that you are fearful of only exists in your brain. It is your brain #8217;s interpretation of the trillions of cells assembled into the shape of a person. My explanation is pretty crap but you try Googling it for more info, if it intrigues you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I #8217;ve heard of people thinking that it is nihilistic. They think that it means nothing exists. Everything is created by our minds so what #8217;s the point of anything? But that #8217;s not true. To me, emptiness means the lack of *inherent* existence. Things exist but they only exist due to each of their individual parts being assembled together. Our minds tend to see things as having a certain inherent existence without reference to the pieces that they are made of. There #8217;s a useful philosophical puzzle that might help anybody struggling to grasp the concept: Imagine a beautiful wooden ship, like one of those old ships with the big sails. Picture it in your mind. Imagine that I replace the wheel (that thing the captain uses to steer it) with a new one. It looks identical but it #8217;s new. Is it still the same ship? I presume you would say yes. Imagine now that I go on board and replace another part of the ship with a new part. Imagine that I keep doing this until every single piece of that ship has been replaced. Is it the same ship as before? At what point did it switch to being a different ship? The point of this is to demonstrate that there is no such thing as the old ship and the new ship. That is to give them a sense of inherentness that they don #8217;t have. There is simply an assembly of parts that our brains perceive as a single object called a ship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was really surprised to read in a few interviews with Neil D and Halley G that they were changing fundamental parts of the game all the way through the development process. I think they mentioned that for a long time Ellie was going to kill Abby at the end. And there was a playable section within Jackson where it would be semi-open world. We all know how long these things take to produce so it #8217;s baffling to me that they would be chopping and changing all the way through. In film production they plan everything almost down to the shot ahead of time. It #8217;s called Pre-Production. They plan the entire movie in advance and only come to actually shoot it once they #8217;re happy with the plan. It seems that at Naughty Dog they just bumble along, producing stuff then dropping it as they go. It must be so demoralising for the staff there, to have Neil ask you to make a particular section and you work for weeks on it only for them to change their mind and drop it. Like, WTF?! It sounds like a chaotic and messy way to run a professional studio. Naughty Dog always talks about how their employees love what they do and want to work late because they want everything to be the very best it can be. I can believe that - some people really do love their craft and want it to be perfect. But I bet those same people get very pissed off the thing they #8217;ve been slaving over gets dropped. And I bet they are also pissed that Neil led them all to produce a 5.6 game.</TEXT>

Much like mountains, or buildings, they just exist and we don #8217;t think much about them. Princess Anne tends to be quite well thought of because she #8217;s seen as the hardest worker. Andrew is very unpopular at the moment. The less said, the better.</TEXT>
